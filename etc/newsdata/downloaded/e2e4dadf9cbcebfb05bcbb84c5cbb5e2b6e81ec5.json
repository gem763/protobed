The company will soon have such high-speed internet up and running in Brownsville, which has a population of 10,000.\n\nStill, the company\u2019s founder and CEO, Jonathan Harlan, said any future expansions will have to be carefully weighed.\n\n\u201cWe have other cities in which we want to build in west Tennessee, but now I have to consider whether utility companies are going to be my competitor,\u201d he told Watchdog.org.\n\nA bill that would let Tennessee\u2019s 23 electric cooperatives offer broadband services to customers has now been amended to add video services as a possibility, and it\u2019s moving quickly through the Legislature. The legislation, H.B. 529, will be heard in the House Business and Utilities Committee on Wednesday, where it\u2019s expected to be passed and sent to the full House for a vote following a 13-0 passage in the House Business and Utilities Subcommittee. Companion bill S.B. 1215 passed the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee on Tuesday by an 8-0 vote.\n\nThe bills were created to help expand the reach of broadband into rural areas, but some private providers are unhappy about the legislation, noting that nonprofit co-ops don\u2019t face the same costs and tax structures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to me the electric companies want to get into the entertainment business,\u201d Harlan said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty far afield from offering low-cost power.\u201d\n\nGov. Bill Haslam added the video component to his Tennessee Broadband Accessibility Act as it moved through the House Business and Utilities Subcommittee. Assistant Majority Leader David Hawk, R-Greeneville, who is carrying the legislation for the governor, noted that adding a video option would increase the chances of broadband being more widely adopted.\n\nHe said the change \u201cmade a good bill even better.\u201d\n\nDavid Callis, general manager of the Tennessee Electric Cooperative Association, said in a statement the bill would help facilitate broadband growth in rural Tennessee.\n\n\u201cThis legislation will not only help areas with the greatest need for high-speed internet, but it will also create jobs and improve access to education and health care,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Uniquely situated\u2019 cooperatives\n\nHaslam offered his act as an alternative to a push to allow municipal broadband networks to expand, and while this bill lets cooperatives offer broadband or video it wouldn\u2019t allow them to grow beyond current service areas.\n\nRELATED: Tennessee governor pitches plan for grants, tax credits for broadband providers\n\nThe Republican governor\u2019s proposal said co-ops are \u201cuniquely situated to assist in bridging the broadband accessibility gap with experience serving areas with lower population densities and providing universal service throughout their territories.\u201d\n\nCooperatives would not be able to use their electric system assets to subsidize broadband services; instead, they would have to create separate standalone divisions.\n\nMunicipal broadband networks and private providers could also partner with cooperatives under the plan, selling bandwidth at the wholesale level to cooperatives, who would when offer broadband at the retail level to their customers.\n\nThe act also offers $30 million in grants and $15 millions in tax credits on the purchase of network equipment to help telecom providers build and expand broadband in rural Tennessee.\n\nHarlan said there are dozens of smaller providers like his business working to expand broadband across Tennessee, but because they don\u2019t have the lobbying presence of a Comcast or an AT&T they\u2019re \u201cinvisible\u201d to the legislature. Aeneas is based in Jackson, and has a strong footprint in areas within an hour radius around the city.\n\nHe\u2019s heard that other providers have been cautious about growing in rural Tennessee in the past few years as legislative talk has centered around allowing municipal broadband to expand and they feared competing against the government. Now, those providers may have to compete against co-ops instead, which have received millions in grants from governments over the years to build and maintain electric monopolies and also pay less in property taxes.\n\n\u201cThis displaces capital allocation and private enterprise that grows to serve the market demand,\u201d Harlan said.\n\nHe\u2019s concerned that the bill doesn\u2019t explicitly state co-ops must provide universal broadband service, allowing them to potentially cherry pick customers, potentially targeting business and industry and avoiding harder-to-reach areas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll leave the farmer \u2014 unless he\u2019s on the co-op board \u2014 unserved,\u201d Harlan said.\n\nCrossing state lines\n\nWilliam Haines, owner and CEO of America Internet & Communications in Cleveland in eastern Tennessee, told Watchdog he has the same concerns about cherry picking.\n\n\u201cIf they really want to help the underserved they should put teeth in [the bill] so they have to serve everybody,\u201d he said.\n\nHaines\u2019 business offers wireless broadband services across five Tennessee counties, beaming signals from 40 towers situated across east Tennessee. Customers get download speeds between 10-40 megabits per second, depending on their distance from the towers. He was looking to expand into another area, but is now taking a wait-and-see approach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one community I wanted to go into, but I\u2019m scared because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Haines told Watchdog.\n\nHis business was based out of Chattanooga until the taxpayer-subsidized Electric Power Board \u201cran us out,\u201d he said.\n\nWireless services like those offered by America Internet & Communications could be a solution to the rural broadband problem with their ability to beam signals through the air rather than through expensive-to-lay fiber, but Haines said given the legislative attitude in his home state, he\u2019s looking to expand into the Peach State where he\u2019s already added one tower.\n\n\u201cIf Tennessee keeps doing what they\u2019re doing I\u2019m going to cross state lines to Georgia,\u201d he said.\n\nNot all private providers have spoken against Haslam\u2019s proposal. AT&T spokesman Joe Burgan called the bill \u201can innovative approach to rural broadband expansion\u201d in a statement he sent to Watchdog, and said the company \u201csupport[s] the measure as amended.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s proposal builds on the work and investment of private providers like AT&T to help bridge the gap to those remaining unserved areas,\u201d he said.\n\nThat company got slammed by Rep. Dan Howell, R-Georgetown, who released a statement criticizing AT&T for helping to kill the 2016 bill that would have allowed municipal broadband expansion.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s unfair that AT&T of Tennessee received $156 million in federal subsidies in September 2015 to provide broadband to the rural areas of Tennessee, while using their deep pockets and 14 lobbyists to kill HB 1303 and, as a result, any competition to their and the other big telecoms\u2019 monopoly,\u201d Howell said.\n\nBurgan told Watchdog the company will continue its \u201caggressive fiber deployment\u201d in the Volunteer State.\n\n\u201cAT&T\u2019s effort to connect more than 81,000 unserved rural locations with fixed wireless broadband is well underway, an initiative that will substantially reduce the number of households with limited broadband access,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnny Kampis reports on national issues for Watchdog.org.
