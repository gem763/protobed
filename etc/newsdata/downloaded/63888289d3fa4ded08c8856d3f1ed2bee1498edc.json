It\u2019s yours in four easy payments", "language": "en", "text": "Gone are the days when special financing plans were mostly reserved for big-ticket purchases like TVs and refrigerators. Now, sweaters, makeup or other everyday items can be paid for in installments with loans or other payment plans offered at checkout with thousands of merchants in the U.S., including Walmart Inc., Urban Outfitters Inc. and, soon, H&M . Some Amazon.com Inc. credit-card users can also sign up for these plans.\n\nMerchants and lenders are tapping into the financial challenges many U.S. families are facing. Despite signs of a strong economy, like low unemployment, consumers are increasingly relying on borrowing to fund their daily lives. U.S. consumer debt is higher than ever, as cars, college, housing and medical care grow more expensive but incomes stay largely stagnant.\n\nThe payment plans often resonate with young adults who are wary of carrying credit-card balances after watching their parents struggle with debt during the last recession. Financial technology companies such as Affirm, Afterpay Touch Group Ltd. APT -1.91% and PayPal Holdings Inc. dove into these payment plans after that period, when banks pulled back on consumer lending.\n\nGrowth is booming.
