To achieve this, the nests are built with a large south facing surface. When the sun comes out, the ants all gather on that surface to absorb the heat before heading back inside to warm up the nest.\n\nAnd that's not the only clever design in this woodland des res. The ants have also installed an expertly engineered air conditioning system.\n\n\"You see holes dotted about on the nest,\" explained Gabrielle. \"Those are entrance holes but also holes for air to flow through, and that means there's no stagnant air forming and it avoids the risk of disease.\"\n\n\"[The nest] is very well constructed. They're good architects.\"", "description": "A lot of thought has gone into this woodland des-res.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07qjpq2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
