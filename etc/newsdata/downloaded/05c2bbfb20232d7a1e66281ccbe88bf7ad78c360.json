Those who are already receiving their pension will normally continue to be paid in full.\n\nThis 10 per cent haircut was applied to employees in most of the 13 funds for Carillion employees, and to thousands of others whose employer has gone under leaving a black hole in the pension fund.\n\nThe PPF is financed by a levy on company pension funds. At the moment, it has plenty of money at its disposal to meet obligations to current and future pensioners. But top brass fear a case brought by Gunther Bauer, a worker for a defunct German company, could prove devastating for its finances.\n\nThe Bauer case \u2013 which is before the ECJ in Luxembourg \u2013 asserts that under human rights law and the Insolvency Directive, pension bail-out funds have no right to cut benefits and should pay in full.\n\nIf successful, the PPF would be required not just to upgrade future payments by 10 per cent but also, at huge cost, to back date to the date when schemes entered the PPF.\n\nMorley admitted such a verdict would benefit retirees. \u2018If you are a pensioner you would see the ECJ coming in as a white knight\u2019, he said, even though it would cast a cloud over the future of the fund.", "description": "Oliver Morley, chief executive of the Pensions Protection Fund warns that if the ECJ decision goes the wrong way then the fund could face a bill for tens of billions of pounds.", "authors": ["Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
