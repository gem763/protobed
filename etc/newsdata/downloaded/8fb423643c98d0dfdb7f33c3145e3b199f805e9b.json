He was grabbing for Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThe pain would come later, after the whistle blew and Turay writhed on the ground while his teammates huddled in twos and threes, offering up prayers. For now, latching onto Mahomes and gator-rolling him to the ground, Turay ignored the pain to make the play.\n\nThat\u2019s how it was Sunday night for the Indianapolis Colts, who beat the undefeated Chiefs 19-13. Not because they were the better team, but something more dangerous: They were tougher.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we talk about,\u201d the most physical Colt of them all, left guard Quenton Nelson, was saying afterward in the ebullient visitors\u2019 locker room. \u201cWe say the tougher team is going to win.\u201d\n\nTook them five games, but the Colts finally found their identity in the post-Andrew Luck era. They aren\u2019t going to beat teams by winning a football beauty contest. They have depth and talent, but not the kind of depth and talent that will overwhelm many NFL opponents. No, the Colts won\u2019t win games because they\u2019re bigger or stronger or faster or more skilled. If they win \u2013 as they won Sunday night at Arrowhead Stadium \u2013 they will win because of plays like Turay made on the Chiefs\u2019 final drive, ignoring the pain to combine with fellow defensive end Jabaal Sheard for the sack.\n\nThey will win because Marlon Mack, listed as questionable with an ankle injury, trotted around the field almost two hours before kickoff and told the coaches he could play. The training staff taped his ankle, then again, and again. Quarterback Jacoby Brissett handed Mack the ball again, then again, and again. Mack finished with 29 carries for 132 yards, his ankle swollen and blood dripping from his right elbow.\n\nAnd they will win because of choices like the one Kenny Moore II made in the first quarter, sitting on the sideline, knocked out of the game with a knee injury.\n\n'I\u2019m disappointing my family'\n\nKenny Moore was the sideline, and he wasn\u2019t the only one. Pierre Desir was over there. So was Shakial Taylor. The Colts had come into this Sunday night game without both their starting safeties, Clayton Geathers and Malik Hooker, and now they were down three cornerbacks. Colts defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus was looking around for potential replacements.\n\n\u201c\u2019Flus was about to devise a whole new game plan on the fly,\u201d Colts coach Frank Reich said.\n\nMoore, whose knee had been wrenched when he was hit by teammate George Odum on the Chiefs\u2019 opening drive, was sitting there on the sideline, miserable.\n\nSaid Moore: \u201cIt got to the point where I\u2019m thinking: \u2018I\u2019m disappointing my team. I\u2019m disappointing my family.\u2019 The training staff came over and said: \u2018If you\u2019re not comfortable going back out there \u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nMoore pauses.\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d he says. \u201cThat will never be me. I got my helmet and went back out there.\u201d\n\nLet the record show: Kenny Moore also got a sack. Smallest guy on the field, Kenny Moore. He\u2019s 5-9 and 190 pounds, and he\u2019s a combination slot corner and outside linebacker. It makes no sense, but Kenny Moore is a lot like this Colts team on Sunday night: Not the prettiest sight, perhaps, but too damn tough for the other team.\n\nMoore went back onto the field in the second quarter, and soon he\u2019s lining up in the box, smallest linebacker you ever saw, and now he\u2019s charging Chiefs left tackle Cam Erving. And poor Erving, he has no chance. I mean, the guy\u2019s only 6-5, 313 pounds.\n\nMoore\u2019s charging him at full speed, or as fast as he can go on that knee, and Erving is backing up and helpless and finally swinging his left arm at Moore. He\u2019s trying to clothesline Moore, but Moore is ducking underneath him \u2013 I swear, this looked like a cartoon \u2013 and attacking Mahomes and dragging him down for a sack.\n\nNow Moore is hopping to his feet, as fast as he can on that knee, and he\u2019s flexing. Smallest guy on the field. And he\u2019s a terror.\n\n'Prepared to do crazy things'\n\nAll week long, Frank Reich had this feeling. Understand, Reich isn\u2019t one of those guys who has this feeling all the time. He\u2019s a lot like a baseball manager, taking the temperature of his team, believing the mental side is every bit as important as the physical, and this week Reich could just sense what would happen Sunday night.\n\n\u201cWe were hungry all week,\u201d Reich said. \u201cI know that\u2019s not uncommon, but there was something different about this week. I think we all felt it. I could feel it. It was palpable.\u201d\n\nAs the week went along and the Colts\u2019 injury list looked worse and worse, people around town \u2013 and I was one of them, on Twitter \u2013 were gently suggesting the Colts might want to mail in this game. All-Pro linebacker Darius Leonard was out with a concussion, one of four defensive starters unavailable. On offense the team\u2019s best two skill players, Mack and Pro Bowl receiver T.Y. Hilton, were questionable. So was inside linebacker Anthony Walker. With the off week after this game, well, wouldn\u2019t it have made sense just to sit all those injured players for Game 5, and focus on the final 11 games?\n\nNope, not the Colts. General manager Chris Ballard, who sits in the press box grinding his teeth and muttering and stewing as the game goes along, isn\u2019t wired that way. Neither is Reich. He played Mack and Hilton and Walker, and afterward, none of those guys would talk about the efforts required to get them on the field. Teammates talked admiringly about the time and effort those guys spent in the training room this week, and the time they spent before the game getting prepared for battle, but no details were offered. Tough teams don\u2019t brag about their boo-boos; they ignore them.\n\nAnd Reich was willing to do anything to get this win.\n\n\u201cWe were prepared to do some crazy things,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, go for fourth downs being backed up, and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nBut they never had to. Desperate teams do crazy things, and while Reich wanted this win badly, he never felt desperate. The Colts, after an early flurry from Mahomes, were in control.\n\nThey had former Chiefs defensive end Justin Houston picking up one sack and crashing around the edge to tackle Kansas City running back Damien Williams on fourth-and-1 in the fourth quarter and then rising and roaring in the direction of the Chiefs\u2019 sideline. They had George Odum replacing Geathers and chasing down LeSean McCoy to club the ball loose for a turnover. They had Grover Stewart bull-rushing 6-5, 321-pound Chiefs guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif for a 10-yard sack.\n\nThey had the offensive line \u2013 from left to right, Anthony Castonzo, Nelson, Ryan Kelly, Mark Glowinski and Braden Smith, because how do you name just one of them? \u2013 blowing open holes for Mack, who was patient enough and trusting enough to wait for the openings to develop.\n\nThey had Adam Vinatieri, whose future was debated around here just a few weeks ago, making all four field goals and his only extra point. They had Division II Malone University alum Ashton Dulin, inactive for two games this season, filling in for George Odum on special teams \u2013 Odum was filling in for Geathers at safety, remembers? \u2013 and beating a double vise to blow up a Kansas City punt return. They had quarterback Jacoby Brissett offering a workmanlike, glitz-free 151-yard outing and scoring the Colts\u2019 only touchdown by pump-faking Chiefs linebacker Anthony Hitchens into oblivion on a 1-yard scoring run.\n\nThey had 19 points. Against the highest-scoring team in the NFL, against the most beautiful quarterback in the league, that was enough. Because this wasn\u2019t a beauty contest. This was a football game, and the Colts were just ugly enough to beat the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n\u201cThe one emotion we\u2019re not feeling,\u201d Reich said, \u201cis shock.\u201d\n\nFind IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter at @GreggDoyelStar or at www.facebook.com/gregg.doyel.", "description": "The Colts beat the Chiefs and their beautiful quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, because this wasn't a beauty contest -- this was a football game.", "authors": ["Gregg Doyel", "Published A.M.
