She was not a candidate of the IFP,\" Msimang added. \"I did not know her. I based my nomination on her CV.\"\n\nHe said all parties bar one had supported her nomination.\n\nANC MP Richard Dyantyi said the subcommittee was busy with drafting rules that were not specific to an individual.\n\nThe subcommittee also received briefings from the National Assembly's table staff and DA chief whip John Steenhuisen.\n\nSteenhuisen concurred with the table staff that an advisory panel should determine whether there was a prima facie case for the removal of a Chapter 9 head and the speaker of the National Assembly should appoint this panel.\n\nHe said it would remove the \"partisan sting\" from the proceedings and stop frivolous cases.\n\n\"It should not be an easy process to remove the head of a Chapter 9 institution. Their independence should be jealously protected.\"\n\nHe said the rules should also leave room for genuine errors, adding as such, it was important to differentiate between mistakes made in good faith and conduct in bad faith.\n\nSteenhuisen and the table staff also agreed the person affected should be allowed to defend him or herself against the removal proceedings.\n\nThe head of a Chapter 9 institution will also be allowed legal counsel but must interact with the committee that will investigate his or her removal.\n\nThe subcommittee also asked the table staff to draft specific definitions for the grounds of removal.\n\nThe table staff will present this to the subcommittee in early October.\n\nOnce the subcommittee reaches an agreement on the draft rules, it will be referred to the rules committee, which will submit its recommendations to the National Assembly for approval and adoption.\n\nThe matter was referred to the rules committee by the portfolio committee on justice and correctional services after the DA lodged a request to remove Mkhwebane from her post after several adverse court findings against her.\n\nAs Parliament does not have rules that set out a procedure to remove the head of a Chapter 9 institution, it was decided to ask the rules committee to draft rules before proceeding with the DA's request, a move the party supported.", "description": "The MP who nominated Busisiwe Mkhwebane to the ad hoc committee that elected a new Public Protector has distanced his party from her nomination, saying he did not know her when he nominated her.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9181/c07acef38883452a8530e9aa6a086bda.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
