It is an investigation to determine the facts. Right now we're looking at advertising, but the facts will lead to where the facts lead.\"\n\nThe group comprises attorneys general from 48 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. Notably, Alabama and California \u2014 where Google's headquarters is \u2014 are the only states that have not thrown their support behind the investigation.\n\nPaxton said that the attorneys general had already requested information from Google and that while the investigation would begin by looking into Google's advertising business, the group would consider examining other facets of the company \"if there are other facts that demonstrate that we need to go in another direction.\"\n\nIn 2019, Google is on pace to own over 31% of the worldwide digital-advertising market, according to eMarketer estimates.\n\nKarl Racine, the attorney general for the District of Columbia, said it was too early in the investigation to speculate about penalties should Google be found to be in violation of the law.\n\nPoliticians including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, have called on Google to \"unwind\" by divesting itself of major acquisitions like its Waze map service, its Nest smart-home hardware company, and its DoubleClick advertising platform.\n\nThe announcement from the state attorneys general followed reports on Friday that the Department of Justice had begun its own antitrust investigation into Google. The search giant said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing released last week that the DOJ had requested information about its previous antitrust probes in the US and abroad.\n\nA Google representative declined to comment for this story and instead pointed to last week's blog post from Kent Walker, its senior vice president of global affairs, acknowledging that the DOJ had requested information from Google and that the company expected similar questions from state attorneys general.\n\nOn Friday, The Wall Street Journal also confirmed that state AGs led by Letitia James of New York were planning a separate investigation into Facebook to evaluate its grip on competitors and whether it mishandled user data. Facebook acknowledged in July that it was under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission over antitrust concerns.\n\nGoogle faced a federal antitrust investigation in 2013 by the FTC regarding its search and smartphone business practices. Google walked away without incurring any financial penalties, committing itself only to vague promises to change some of its business practices.\n\nRead more: Here's what could happen to Google and its $137 billion business empire if it loses the antitrust battle\n\nEuropean regulators, on the other hand, have taken a sharper stance with Google, fining the tech giant roughly $10 billion in recent years for various anticompetitive practices involving its advertising, search, and mobile businesses.\n\nGot a tip?
