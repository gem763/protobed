Photo: Courtesy of the vendor\n\nI don\u2019t enjoy washing up. No one does, I think \u2014 not really. There are people who like it more than others, just as there are people who say that they like ironing, or cleaning the windows \u2014 but no one actually looks forward to the washing up. Not so long ago, I treated myself to some fancy soap in the hope of making this mundane chore (I\u2019m a cookery writer so produce disproportionately large quantities of washing up) that little bit more fun.\n\nI first bought this because I loved the bottle: It\u2019s an elegant bottle, with clean slim lines. It\u2019s plastic \u2014 granted, glass would be better \u2014 but it\u2019s not cheap looking or chunky plastic, and the label is all-round fabulous: regal, pomegranate red, with impeccably chic typography and an extravagant gold edging. Plus it\u2019s by French brand Astier de Villatte \u2014 and while their finely crafted plates at hundreds of pounds each have become a permanent fixture on my wish list, they are not what I would call \u2018impulse buys\u2019; this at \u00a320 a bottle just nudges the title. It\u2019s an affordably extravagant, aesthetically pleasing alternative to the garish bottle of Fairy Liquid that loiters, slightly scuzzy and worn, atop our kitchen sink.\n\nYet now that I find myself walking this path of designer washing-up liquid, I have also found that there is no turning back: It might have been the pretty bottle that first caught my eye, but it\u2019s the dusty-rose-pink soap that comes within which has fully captured my heart. It smells so delicious, like brushing against an intensely scented bush of bay leaves. Not a sweet or sickly scent, but subtle and deeply, intoxicatingly \u2014 for want of a better word \u2014 aromatic. The perfume doesn\u2019t linger on your plates: They come up clean, not scented, but you can smell the soap on your hands, luxuriate in it even. It comes in an array of equally heavenly sounding scents: Citrusy bergamot and black pepper are next on my list.\n\nMy only reservation is that you will find you get through a bottle quickly: Astier de Villate it seems doesn\u2019t quite have that utilitarian quality of good old Fairy Liquid, where a single bottle lasts you seemingly a lifetime \u2014 though whether that\u2019s because of the quality of the soap, or quite simply because I like it so much that I splash it around in extravagant quantities, I couldn\u2019t tell you.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
