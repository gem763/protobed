Coupled with the drop in the level of Chinese investment and acquisition appetite in the region, valuation expectations in parts of Asia Pacific are starting to fall,\" said Singapore-based Dechert PE partner Siew Kam Boon.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\n\"For certain funds and their portfolio companies, this could present unique opportunities, particularly if the target company possesses strong fundamentals.\"\n\nThe report surveyed 100 senior-level executives within PE firms with over US$500 million or more in assets under management, including 20 in Asia-Pacific.\n\nTwo-fifths of the Asia-Pacific respondents expected the trade conflict between the United States and China to be the factor with the largest impact on the region's deal environment in the next 12 to 18 months. Another quarter cited China's economic slowdown -- itself linked in part to trade tensions -- as the most significant variable.\n\n\"Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam are all beneficiaries of the current situation,\" said Mr Siew. \"There is also a new level of interest in other frontier markets. Southeast Asia seems to be gaining a lot of attention.\"\n\nConcluded the report: \"What were once frontier markets in Southeast Asia are beginning to be seen as true emerging markets, like the BRICS a decade ago. GPs (general partners) with global remits should consider investing in these markets now if they are prepared to face the risks associated with the potential outsized rewards.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES ASEAN Business - This comes as China's private equity activity is likely to remain subdued amid ongoing trade tensions .
