Available now for $179 each or $299 purchased as a pair, the Smart Soundbar and subwoofer follow the release of the Roku TV Wireless Speakers.\n\nBut unlike those speakers, which cost $149, the new soundbar and subwoofer work with all TV brands instead of only those powered by Roku's TV operating system. I've been using both the soundbar and subwoofer in my living room, watching TV, playing video games, and listening to music, and I\u2019ve liked what I\u2019ve heard so far.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Smart Soundbar also doubles as a premium Roku player, offering 4K, HDR streaming and a voice-enabled remote. For $179, it's a heck of a deal, and with the added subwoofer, Roku has created quite a worthwhile pair.\n\nRoku's Smart Soundbar offers a full 4K Roku player and soundbar in one device.

The soundbar itself packs four audio drivers that produce far better sound than the tiny speakers packed into my 55-inch LG TV.\n\nThe problem with modern, super-slim TVs is that while the images they produce keep getting better, the audio they put out gets worse. That's because speakers need both room and size to push the air around them to create the dialogue, explosions, and songs that make up movies and TV shows.\n\nBut huge home theater speaker systems aren't exactly helpful for space-conscious consumers. Soundbars are a means to split the difference. They feature speakers that are larger than those built into today's TVs, but manage to fit neatly on a TV stand.\n\nRoku's Smart Soundbar offers far superior sound to your built-in TV speakers. (Image: Roku) More\n\nPricing for soundbars varies wildly with some units available for as little as $60, while you might pay as much as $2,500 for the outrageously expensive Sennheiser Ambeo soundbar. At $179, Roku's offering is right in the sweet spot for inexpensive soundbars. The addition of a Roku player built into the unit makes it all the more impressive.\n\nWhat's more, Roku has equipped the soundbar with both optical audio and HDMI ARC ports, and chances are your TV also supports both. Between the two, it's best to use the soundbar's HDMI ARC port, as it can handle higher resolution audio, and serves to connect the Roku player in the speaker to your TV in one cable.\n\nIf you use the optical port, you'll need to connect both that and an HDMI cable to your TV. HDMI ARC also allows you to control some of your TV's functions through the Roku remote.\n\nNaturally, the Roku Smart Soundbar outputs audio even if you're using a different HDMI input source. For instance, I switched my TV to the HDMI input for my PlayStation 4, and the HDMI ARC port allowed the sound to pass through my TV to the soundbar.\n\nNormally, it would be a pain to lose an HDMI port on your TV for a soundbar, but because the Smart Soundbar includes a full Roku player that you'd likely connect to your TV via HDMI anyway, it evens out.\n\nFrom a features standpoint, the Roku soundbar includes four, 2.5-inch drivers, or speakers, that handle both high-frequency and low-frequency audio. By itself, the soundbar has a good deal of power without sounding overwhelming. Dialogue was clear and bass was relatively powerful for the soundbar's size.", "description": "Roku's new feature-packed Smart Soundbar and Wireless Subwoofer offer quality sound at an affordable price.", "authors": ["Daniel Howley", "Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SoesSlOvQBzxxhEdvY1PbQ--~B/aD02MDA7dz03ODA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/7c2f0f20-f98b-11e9-bfbf-1bee42619b85", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
