I\u2019d let her, if she\u2019s wearing a black dress, a black lip.\n\n\u201cKylie would give her all of these lip kits, so I kind of got in trouble for that. So, it\u2019s now no more makeup.\u201d\n\nIn March, Kardashian also faced a backlash on social media from mum-shamers, who criticised her for allowing North to wear black lipstick to church services hosted by the family.\n\nWest, who today released his long-awaited new album Jesus is King, has also banned the couple\u2019s oldest child from wearing crop tops - a decision he says he made after becoming a Christian.\n\nSpeaking with Zane Lowe for Beats 1, the rapper said he doesn\u2019t think North should wear crop tops because he \u201cthinks and feels differently now\u201d.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think North should wear crop tops just because I had her wearing a slip dress when she was two-years-old. I think and feel differently now, now that I\u2019m Christian, now that I\u2019m founder of a $3bn organisation and married for five years,\u201d he said.", "description": "Kim Kardashian has revealed that her husband Kanye West has banned the couple\u2019s daughter North from wearing makeup until she is a teenager, sparking a \u201cbig fight in the household\u201d.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/17/gettyimages-1076421838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
