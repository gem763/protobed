(Susan Walsh/Associated Press)\n\nFor the past four years, I\u2019ve made five preposterously positive predictions about the Redskins\u2019 coming seasons \u2014 team and individual accomplishments that are within the realm of possibility, but highly unlikely to occur. They\u2019re a degree more ridiculous than your typical bold predictions, which often aren\u2019t especially bold.\n\nIn 2015, three out of my five seemingly outlandish predictions came true, including Kirk Cousins throwing at least 15 more touchdowns than interceptions. Since then, I\u2019ve gone 0-15, which is a more appropriate reflection of a preseason exercise that, while rooted in facts and analysis, is supposed to be more fun than serious.\n\nIn the spirit of tradition, here are five things that the Redskins probably won\u2019t (but maybe will!) accomplish this season:\n\n1. Derrius Guice will rush for at least 1,500 yards.\n\nWhy it\u2019s preposterous: Here\u2019s the list of Redskins who have rushed for 1,500 yards in a season: Clinton Portis and Alfred Morris. Guice, a second-round pick in 2018, missed all of his rookie campaign after suffering a torn ACL in his first preseason game, and while he looked good in limited action this preseason, it remains to be seen if he can handle the workload of a No. 1 back. Washington averaged 110.9 yards rushing per game last season, 17th in the league. Entering training camp, Pro Football Focus suggested the Redskins\u2019 offensive line had the potential to be a top-five unit. Without Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams, who continues to hold out, PFF ranks Washington\u2019s O-line 20th in the league.\n\nWhy it could happen: Many of you scoffed at last year\u2019s prediction in this space that Adrian Peterson would rush for at least 1,200 yards, and for good reason. The 34-year-old, who was signed off the scrap heap during training camp, ultimately fell short of that number, but he did become the first Redskins running back to eclipse 1,000 yards since Morris in 2014. Coach Jay Gruden recently made it clear that Guice, 22, will receive the lion\u2019s share of the carries this year. \u201cWe drafted him for a reason,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe feel like he can be a first-, second- and even third-down back if needed. The offense, carries-wise, will probably go through him, pretty much.\u201d With or without Williams, if the offensive line can stay healthier this season than it has over the past two years, Guice could live up to the hype.\n\n[NFL expert picks for 2019 season: Who will win the Super Bowl?]\n\n2. Washington will lead the league in sacks.\n\nWhy it\u2019s preposterous: The Redskins\u2019 46 sacks last season were their most since they had 50 in 1991 en route to winning the Super Bowl, and yet Washington still finished with six fewer sacks than 2018 league leaders Kansas City and Pittsburgh. Outside linebacker Preston Smith, who registered four sacks while starting every game last year, signed with the Packers during the offseason.\n\nWhy it could happen: Washington\u2019s young defensive line, including the Alabama Wall of Jonathan Allen and Daron Payne, is already among the NFL\u2019s best. Allen and Matt Ioannidis combined for 15.5 sacks last year, while Payne had five as a rookie. Outside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan notched his third consecutive season with double-digit sacks (13) and will break Dexter Manley\u2019s franchise record of 91 sacks with seven more this year. The Redskins traded up to draft pass rusher Montez Sweat in the first round and many expect the rookie to be an upgrade over Smith. This is the least preposterous prediction of the bunch.\n\n3. Terry McLaurin will catch at least eight touchdown passes.\n\nWhy it\u2019s preposterous: When was the last time a rookie receiver burst on the scene in D.C. with a memorable first year? Charlie Brown set the Redskins\u2019 rookie record for touchdown receptions with eight in nine games during the strike-shortened 1982 season. Since then, Gary Clark\u2019s five touchdowns in 1985 and Rod Gardner\u2019s four touchdowns in 2001 are the team\u2019s high-water marks for first-year receivers. NBC Sports Washington\u2019s Peter Hailey crunched the numbers on how wide receivers selected in the third round, as McLaurin was, have fared in their rookie years over the past five seasons, and they\u2019re not exactly encouraging. Washington\u2019s last third-round wide receiver, Leonard Hankerson, had 13 catches for 163 yards in four games as a rookie in 2011.\n\nWhy it could happen: McLaurin was a touchdown machine during his senior season at Ohio State, with 11 of his 35 receptions resulting in scores. There\u2019s a decent chance the quarterback who threw McLaurin all but one of those touchdowns, Redskins first-round pick Dwayne Haskins, will be starting in Washington before the season is done. The 6-foot, 210-pound McLaurin had an impressive training camp and will start in Week 1 on the outside. For as long as Case Keenum has the starting quarterback job, he\u2019ll be forced to rely on a young receiving corps; Paul Richardson Jr. is the team\u2019s only wideout with more than two years of experience.\n\n[The Redskins decided to go young at WR. They don't plan to use that as an excuse.]\n\n4. The Redskins\u2019 offense will crack the top 10 in scoring.\n\nWhy it\u2019s preposterous: Washington hasn\u2019t finished in the top 10 in scoring since 2015, when Cousins rewrote several single-season franchise records while slinging the ball around to Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson. Last year, the Redskins averaged 17.6 points per game, the fourth-fewest in the league. The recipe for success on offense this season would seem to be controlling the clock with a ground-and-pound attack.\n\nWhy it could happen: The Redskins were the most injured team in the NFL last season, placing 28 players on injured reserve. The offense was hit especially hard by the injury bug, with Washington ranking last in Football Outsiders\u2019 Adjusted Games Lost metric among offensive players. As usual, tight end Jordan Reed\u2019s health will be a major factor. Reed had a career-high 87 catches and 11 touchdowns in 2015, which was also the last time he played in at least 14 games.\n\n5. The Redskins will win at least 10 games.\n\nWhy it\u2019s preposterous: It\u2019s been 28 years since Washington won 11 regular season games, the longest such drought in the NFL. The Redskins have won 10 games only three times since their 1991 Super Bowl season, most recently during Robert Griffin III\u2019s rookie year. Oddsmakers peg the Redskins as a six-win team. Given Washington\u2019s brutal early-season schedule, there\u2019s a very real chance the team is 0-5 heading into a Week 6 showdown against the Dolphins.\n\nWhy it could happen: The Redskins might\u2019ve won 10 games last season if Alex Smith hadn\u2019t suffered a gruesome leg injury in Week 10. Washington was forced to turn to Colt McCoy, Mark Sanchez and finally Josh Johnson, who hadn\u2019t thrown an NFL pass in seven years, over the final six weeks. They still finished 7-9. Better luck on the injury front and an improved defense with the addition of safety Landon Collins could be enough for a three-game turnaround.\n\nPast Preposterous Predictions: 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nCase Keenum is an unwanted QB who keeps winning jobs.
