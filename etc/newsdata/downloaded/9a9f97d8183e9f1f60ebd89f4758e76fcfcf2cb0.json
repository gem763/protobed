The decision was widely seen as a riposte to Hayatou.\n\nWith CAF in turmoil and Ahmad implicated in financial corruption by French investigators, FIFA has sent secretary general Fatma Samoura from Zurich to run the Cairo-based organization.\n\nThe 73-year-old Hayatou has retained honorary membership of the International Olympic Committee and attended meetings in June in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former African soccer leader Issa Hayatou will help organize some of the continent's top tournaments.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
