The material is made from special yarn that Under Armour says can help regulate body temperature.\n\nVirgin Galactic CEO Richard Branson (second from right) and others model the Under Armour Spacewear System for Private Astronauts.\n\nThe Under Armour space gear includes a base layer, spacesuit , footwear, a training suit and a jacket.\n\nAt a press conference Wednesday morning in Yonkers, Galactic's CEO, British billionaire Richard Branson, put on one of his signature PR stunts, with dancers wearing the spacesuits inside a zero-gravity simulation chamber. Branson also donned his own spacesuit, which he plans to wear as Virgin Galactic's first passenger after the company finishes its test flights. Commercial service is expected to begin next year.\n\nEven for a company that regularly outfits professional athletes, executives at Under Armour said there was a steep learning curve to design an ensemble fit for spaceflight.
