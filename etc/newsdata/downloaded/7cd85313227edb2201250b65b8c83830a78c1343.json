If it\u2019s tangy and brown, you\u2019re in cider town!\u201d (Screenshot: Gracie Films)\n\nThere is nothing too smart or too stupid for a mnemonic. They can teach you features of specific neurological disorders, or they can teach you how to open a jar. Here are some of the cleverest memory aids that you might not know yet, as catalogued by Wikipedia.\n\nPhases of the Moon\n\nYou know the moon waxes and wanes, but here\u2019s how to tell what it\u2019s currently doing: Its phases go D, O, C. So if the crescent bulges to the right like a D, it\u2019s waxing to full. If it\u2019s to the left like a C, then it\u2019s waning into a new moon. (This is reversed in the Southern Hemisphere.) Every time I see the moon I say whether it\u2019s waxing or waning. My wife, who could not be reached for comment, loves it.\n\nGuitar strings\n\nThere are a lot of mnemonics for the notes of each string on a standard-tuned guitar, but these are the best:\n\nE very A verage D ude G ets B etter E ventually\n\nE at A ll D ay, G et B ig E asy\n\nEddy Ate Dynamite. Good Bye Eddy\n\nFor ukuleles, it\u2019s Good Cooks Eat A-lot.\n\nAviation flight checks\n\nIn the course of a flight, pilots run multiple checks, and there are mnemonics for any of them. All the mnemonic words sound like alternates for the NATO phonetic alphabet.\n\npre-landing: GUMPS - G as, U ndercarriage, M ixture, P ropeller, S peed.\n\npre-final: MARTHA - M issed (procedure), A ltitude (limit), R adios (set), T ime (limit), H eading (final), A irspeed (descent)\n\npre-high-altitude - FLOWER - F low (enabled), L ights (test), O xygen (charged), W ater (humidity), E lectricity (on), R adio (check)\n\npre-flight-paperwork - ARROW - A irworthiness (certificate), R egistration, R equired (charts), O perating (checklists), W eight and balance\n\nspin recovery - POKER - Power (off), Opposite (full rudder), Klean (flaps, etc), Elevator (briskly forward), Recover (from dive)\n\nThere\u2019s a long one for landing checks called, no joke, BUMMMFITCHH.\n\nSalmon Species\n\nThere are five major types of salmon as far as fishers are concerned, says the Coyote Outdoor Living blog, and here\u2019s how to remember them:\n\nChum is your thumb, Sockeye is your index finger (imagine poking someone\u2019s eye out), King is your middle finger, Silver is your ring finger, and Pink is your pinkie.\n\nEach species has multiple names, and there are others not included here, so I don\u2019t know how far this mnemonic would actually get you on Deadliest Catch. But it feels very clever. If there are any edible types of salmon not included in it, just to keep things simple, we should stop eating them.\n\nReversible Dementia Causes\n\nHey, this isn\u2019t so sad, it\u2019s about reversible dementia, yay! While most mnemonics use whatever word or phrase best fits the terms to memorise, this one conveniently spells out the thing you\u2019re memorising:\n\nD rugs/ D epression\n\nE lderliness\n\nM ulti-infarct/ M edication\n\nE nvironment\n\nN utrition\n\nT oxins\n\nI schemia\n\nAlcohol\n\nIt\u2019d make a great halftime cheer. If you like that one, you should check out the discredited suicide risk assessment scale S.A.D. P.E.R.S.O.N.S.! Haha don\u2019t use that though! Seriously don\u2019t.\n\nSpelling\n\nMnemonics based on words are perfect for spelling:\n\nWe are weird\n\nA principal is your pal; a principle is a rule\n\nA compliment puts you in the limelight; a complement adds something to make enough\n\nRhythm: R hythm H elps Y our T wo H ips M ove\n\nMnemonic: M nemonics N ow E rase M an\u2019s O ldest N emesis, I nsufficient C erebral S torage\n\nYou want to separate from a rat\n\nA friend til the end\n\nBeautiful: Big Elephants Are Ugly\n\nAssorted\n\nLarge SI prefixes for metric values (exa-, peta-, tera-, giga-, mega- kilo-, hecto-, deca-): E very p erson t hat g ave m e k isses h as d iarrhea\n\nCalculating heat loss (P=I2R): Twinkle twinkle little star, Power equals I squared R.\n\nEnglish dynasties (Norman, Plantagenet, Lancaster, York, Tudor, Stuart, Hanover, Windsor): N o P lan L ike Y ours T o S tudy H istory W isely\n\nChinese dynasties (Xia (Hsia), Shang, Zhou (Chou), Qin (Ch\u2019in), Han, Jin, Southern and Northern, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing (Ching)): She Sha mefully Cho se Chin ese Han d Jin gles (and) S i N fully Swee t Tang o Song s: \u201c You (and) Me , Chi ckadee!\u201d\n\nStala c tites are on the c eiling.

Si nce p ast s ix cl osing, ar e k egs ca ncelled?\n\n\u201cTo distinguish colour patterns between the harmless king snake and the poisonous coral snake:\u201d Red next to black is a friend of Jack. Red next to yellow will kill a fellow. (Extreme Ned Flanders vibes.)\n\nFind your own favourites at Wikipedia\u2019s lists of visual mnemonics, and its lists of mnemonics for learning medicine, aviation, firefighting, Morse code, Latin, physics, astronomy, chemistry, anatomy, trig, electronic colour codes, and English monarchs.

And read Mental Floss\u2019s list of history mnemonics.\n\nThe mnemonic for opening jars or screwing in light bulbs is: righty tighty, lefty loosey. That will be stuck in your head forever.", "description": "There is nothing too smart or too stupid for a mnemonic.
