I don\u2019t care what I find out. It could be today, tomorrow, fifteen, twenty years from now \u2014 If I find out, you\u2019re fucking\u2026duh\u2026finished.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d comedian Dave Chappelle asked in his latest Netflix special. \u201cThat\u2019s you! That\u2019s what the audience sounds like to me!\u201d\n\nWatching a Thursday matinee of director and co-writer Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker, I couldn\u2019t help but sense that the movie was asking this same question\u2026 and returning with the same answer.\n\nWho are Joker\u2019s mindless followers? Who are these maladjusted malcontents, these adult losers who live with their mothers; these useless idiots who exist in literal garbage and keep voting for the same politicians to run their Gotham City? Who are these crybabies who worship a murderer, these nihilists who hold RESIST signs, who scream KILL THE RICH!, who hate cops, who \u201cdon\u2019t believe in anything,\u201d who think something\u2019s wrong with society because they\u2019re not \u201chappy all the time\u201d? Who cover their faces with masks so they can riot and go wilding under the pretense this criminal and cowardly behavior is an act of virtue?\n\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d Phillips asks. \u201cThat\u2019s you! That\u2019s what you in the audience look and sound like to me!\u201d\n\nImagine you\u2019re Todd Phillips: You\u2019re 48-years old, and for 20 of those years you devoted yourself to producing one box office comedy hit after another \u2026 and now all of that, everything that defined your work and passion, has been declared \u201cproblematic\u201d by nobodies; by losers whose only skill is tweeting out their mindless cancellation requests: These all white, male, heterosexual bro comedies are problematic.\n\nImagine you\u2019re Todd Phillips, and for the last 20 years you\u2019ve sweated blood, risked much, and faced countless setbacks and failures in pursuit of a hard-earned success in one of the most difficult businesses to succeed in; and now, because of your success and the wealth that comes with it, you are \u201cproblematic\u201d \u2014 as in, We need to occupy and take everything away from problematic rich people.\n\nImagine you\u2019re Todd Phillips, a white heterosexual male under constant attack just for being a white heterosexual male \u2014 as in, White heterosexual males are problematic, especially rich ones who make bro comedies.\n\nHey, art is subjective, and I went into this thing assuming it would be a tribute of sorts to Martin Scorsese\u2019s Taxi Driver (1976) and King of Comedy (1982), a new approach to comic book fare \u2014 you know, that kind of thing.\n\nBut I saw what I saw, and what I saw is this\u2026\n\nAn artist who turned his legitimate frustrations with the Antifa-Occupy-Black Lives Matter-Resistance crybabies, these anarchist-fascists who seek to marginalize men like Todd Phillips for who he is, punish him for his success, and then censor his art. I think Phillips took all of that and turned it into his muse, not only to create the stunning Joker, but to reinvent himself as an artist.\n\n\u201cJoker is you!\u201d Phillips is saying. \u201cJoker is the godless god you spoiled losers worship; a sociopath who believes in nothing, who wants to burn down society because he\u2019s not happy all the time \u2014 your leader is Madness, Anarchy, Intolerance, Jealousy, Envy, Bigotry, and Hate.\u201d\n\nIf that is not enough of a red pill moment, there\u2019s the gun, or\u2026 The Gun.\n\nJoker doesn\u2019t get his hands on The Gun due to lax gun control laws. The Gun comes to him illegally. The Gun empowers a dangerously mentally ill individual who is not getting the mental health help he requires because he lives in an urban nightmare run by incompetent urban politicians.\n\nReviewer after reviewer after reviewer has attacked the movie as siding with the Joker, as empathizing with \u201ca white incel who picks up a gun and lashes out at society to solve his problems.\u201d\n\nWhat movie did these idiots watch? Phillips doesn\u2019t empathize with the Joker. He reverse-engineers him. This character has been around for nearly eighty years, so we already know what he becomes. All Phillips does is take him apart, piece by piece, and give us a tour of his mind.\n\nAnd it is only in his mind, only in his psychosis, that Joker sees himself as capable of humanity and charm. In the real world, the worst of the Joker\u2019s murders are so unthinkable Phillips refuses to let us watch.\n\nNo, no, no\u2026 Joker is not tomorrow\u2019s mass shooter. He is the golden calf worshiped by the very same woketard critics attacking Joker, looking to blacklist artistic expression; Joker is those on Twitter and on Rotten Tomatoes who have never accomplished a single goddamn thing in their own pathetic lives other than to tear those down who have\u2026 Joker is the god of those who condemn Phillips for coloring outside the \u201capproved\u201d lines, for putting RESIST signs in the hands of losers, for daring to speak out against the destruction of his beloved comedy genre in America\u2019s new Woketopia.\n\nThey\u2019re too stupid and too blinded by their own sanctimony to get it: Joker is YOU!\n\nJoker is also a total success, a dead-center bull\u2019s-eye. This not a movie for everyone. Those looking for a summertime, superhero thrill-ride need to look elsewhere. Joker is a monster movie, an October movie, a slow burn of tension and dread with no relief, not even a moment of caped crusader-style catharsis.\n\nAs Arthur Fleck/Joker, Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s performance is a jaw-dropper. His lithe body is as twisted and perverse as his character\u2019s mind. This is a guy barely hanging on, a confused slob dependent on a government-run health care system staffed with soulless bureaucrats protected by a soulless bureaucracy in a city that can\u2019t even pick up the garbage.\n\nJoker warns us of what happens when a society is stupid enough to allow the government to control health care; warns us that what the government giveth, the government can also taketh away. And take away from Fleck it does, and without his medication and with The Gun, Fleck at long last finds a way to matter.\n\nNaturally, the shallow sire of celebrity is one way to matter, but even this is not what it seems. Robert De Niro\u2019s Johnny Carson-style late night host Murray Franklin isn\u2019t the enemy. Sure, he mocks Arthur\u2019s failed stand-up attempt, but then he brings him on the show as a guest, gives him a real shot, and doesn\u2019t allow his booker to bully the poor guy.\n\nPhillips isn\u2019t attacking this old school-style of show business. Instead, he\u2019s reminding us of a more gracious era when people could still take a joke, the pre-Colbert/Kimmel era where the mockery was good-natured instead of bitter elitism, where a handshake and a real opportunity followed.\n\nDe Niro\u2019s Murray Franklin is eventually revealed as a man of conscience and character, a man who made Arthur\u2019s dream literally come true.\n\nSure, Joker is another comic book movie. And yet, it\u2019s really not. Those of us who regularly complain about Hollywood\u2019s lack of originality and adult fare have a reason to rejoice, to have our faith reaffirmed.\n\nBut again, this is not a movie for everyone, certainly not kids. This is the stuff of nightmares, and not just the story. Every shot is disturbing. Phillips knows exactly where to place his camera, and adding to that squirm-in-your-seat sense of dread is Hildur Ingveldard\u00f3ttir Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir\u2019s beautifully unsettling score and Mark Friedberg\u2019s production design, which perfectly recreates pre-Giuliani New York City.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
