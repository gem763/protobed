I'm riding this momentum and using it to my advantage.\"\n\nNa's form certainly impressed the critics.\n\n\"This may well be the best performance on the greens I have ever seen,\" said Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee.", "description": "Na rides hot putting streak to two-shot lead in Las Vegas", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF9501F_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
