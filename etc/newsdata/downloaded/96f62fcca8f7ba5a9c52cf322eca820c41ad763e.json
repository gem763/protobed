Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has been one name linked with the post as he continues to search for a new job.\n\nDimitar Berbatov has told Tottenham that they should stick with manager Mauricio Pochettino\n\nThe ex-Bulgarian striker believes Spurs should overhaul the playing staff instead of the boss\n\nHowever Berbatov, who won two Premier League titles with Manchester United and played for Spurs between 2006 and 2008, insists that Spurs should change things on the pitch rather than the dugout.\n\nSpeaking to Betfair, the Bulgarian said: 'Pochettino is the guy that needs to stay there, he's been there for a long time. There has been a lot of talk about Mourinho taking over at Spurs, I think he would have difficulty as well.\n\n'Would he make Spurs better? I don't know because it is the same team. Yes you can have a bit of a lift in the beginning, like Manchester United did when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer came in.\n\n'Then you need to keep going otherwise you are going to slip into a spiral. I remember Sir Alex Ferguson telling us a team needs to be changed when four years passes.\n\n'Not the whole team but players. After four years some players start to get complacent and they aren't challenged. They are in with the manager and they are comfortable, so a manager needs to shake things up and bring in new player.\n\n'I was thinking that this could be the case with Spurs, a lot of the players have been there a long time. Maybe they need to shake things up and try to push the players in a way.'\n\nSpurs are 13 points behind league leaders Liverpool and were thrashed 7-2 by Bayern Munich\n\nJose Mourinho is monitoring Tottenham's situation as he looks for a route back into the game\n\nIt was revealed earlier this week that Mourinho is monitoring Tottenham's situation as he looks for a route back into management.\n\nThe Portuguese has been out of work since being sacked by United last December, less than a year into a new contract that was due to run until 2020.\n\nSpurs are among the clubs that appeal to the Portuguese manager.\n\nReal Madrid, coached by Zinedine Zidane, are another and the former Chelsea and Inter Milan boss remains in contact and on good terms with president Florentino Perez.\n\nThe 56-year-old is prepared to bide his time and wait for the ideal opportunity. He has been working predominantly as a TV pundit and joined Sky ahead of the season.\n\nHe has declined offers at former club Benfica and a \u00a390million proposal from Chinese Super League side Guangzhou Evergrande.", "description": "Pochettino has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks after a poor start to the season that has left them 13 points behind Liverpool and saw his side thrashed 7-2 by Bayern Munich in Europe.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/22/19559836-0-image-a-64_1570742553863.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
