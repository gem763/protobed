(AP/Brandon Dill)\n\nThe New York Knicks have struggled to land a star in free agency for quite some time \u2014 or even retain the stars they do have on their roster.\n\nLast summer was a prime example of the organization\u2019s struggles, having lost Kristaps Porzingis and failing to land any major free agent despite having an insane amount of cap space available.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFormer Knicks big man Enes Kanter said on Sunday that players he talks to around the league are simply scared of owner James Dolan, and don\u2019t want to take a chance playing for his team.\n\n\u201cNot many people know that, but players talk. From different teams, they talk,\u201d Kanter said on Bleacher Report\u2019s The Full 48 podcast. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming anybody. I had an amazing time with the Knicks. But other teammates that I talked to or if they\u2019re on different teams, they always said, \u2018Amazing city, MSG is amazing everything is so good, but the ownership.\u2019 They would just keep saying, \u2018But the ownership.\u2019 \u2026 Some of the players I guess are just scared to come here and don\u2019t even want to deal with that.\u201d\n\nKanter played for the Knicks for a season and a half, and was released from the team in February \u2014 something he was thrilled about. The 27-year-old finished out the year with the Portland Trail Blazers, and then signed a two-year, $10 million deal with the Boston Celtics this summer.\n\nDespite the Knicks playing in both the best area and the biggest market in the country, the Knicks are losing constantly. The team hasn\u2019t reached the postseason since the 2012-13 season, and only has four seasons with winning records this century \u2014 the worst performance in the league.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the constant struggles, Kanter understands why a star wouldn\u2019t want to waste his prime playing years in the organization. And, when they traded for and then started DeAndre Jordan over him, he knew it was time to leave.\n\nWhen he finally was released, he \u201cwas very happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy job is to go out there and play as hard as I can, because all the fans are paying so much money to come and see the game. Especially at the Garden. It\u2019s packed every game, even if we\u2019re losing,\u201d Kanter said. \u201cMy problem I guess was that I wanted to win. Something that didn\u2019t make sense is they told me I\u2019m too old to play, and I was 26, and I was like, \u2018That doesn\u2019t make sense.\u2019 \u201cThen they bring a guy in four or five years older than me and they start playing him, I\u2019m like, \u2018This doesn\u2019t make sense.\u2019\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "According to Enes Kanter, players across the league are scared to play for the Knicks only because of team owner James Dolan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5BeT4JzIT_dMX6e9c7dMXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/diev5VC24e7b0NPdWdIXSQ--~B/aD0zMjgwO3c9NDkyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/73c94610-d36c-11e9-a2ff-c8beeb990e79", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
