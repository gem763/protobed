You don\u2019t always get things right the first time.\n\n\u201cOur sport is complex, that\u2019s what excites me about my job.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "In the past year International Tennis Federation president David Haggerty has been booed by fans at the Davis Cup final and lambasted over structural changes to the lower rungs of the professional ladder.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ITF.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
