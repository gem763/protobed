This is Kate Taylor, senior retail correspondent at BI.\n\nEvery week, I'll be sending out a rundown of stories that explain what the largest retail companies in the world are up to, and how these decisions impact everyone from Wall Street to grocery store cashiers. You can sign up to become a Drive-Thru subscriber here.\n\nTarget's backrooms are becoming a 'nightmare.'\n\nThe scene inside a Target backroom. Courtesy of an anonymous former Target employee\n\nShoshy Ciment has a fantastic piece of reporting on how Target's decision to quietly cut overnight and backroom shifts in stores is creating massive problems in the backrooms of many stores. Shoshy talked to 28 current and former Target employees. Almost half said that they felt their stores' backrooms had become unsafe.\n\nOne worker told Shoshy that she had hurt herself multiple times in the narrow, overcrowded electronics stockroom.\n\n\"[I] would sometimes tell a guest we were out of a product purely because I didn't want to brave the electronics stockroom for something that wouldn't affect my sales numbers,\" she said, describing a space with aisles barely more than two feet wide with sharp metal corners.\n\nTarget backrooms are just one example of how corporate decisions can make workers' lives more difficult.\n\nHayley Peterson detailed how Amazon's decision to eliminate a position was seen internally as bad news for \"differently abled people or for stay-at-home moms\" who needed the flexibility. (Amazon later reversed its decision.)\n\nShoshy and I reported on how Popeyes' game-changing chicken sandwich made workers' lives a living hell for two weeks. Even putting Instagram-bait Frappuccinos on the menu at Starbucks makes baristas' lives harder in a way that few customers realize.\n\nRead the full story on Target's chaotic backrooms here \u2014 and email retail@businessinsider if you know of another problem workers are facing that needs to be investigated.\n\nTaste test of the week.\n\nIrene is not only a great taste tester, but also an impressive cook. Irene Jiang / Business Insider\n\nTaste tester extraordinaire Irene Jiang has become an Impossible Foods super-fan after being forced to try countless burgers, plant-based and otherwise. With Impossible hitting grocery store shelves, she cooked with the plant-based protein at home.\n\nIrene's take: \"It's pretty much the perfect substitute for ground beef in any recipe, and it's what I'll be using instead of ground beef from now on.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nShopping spree.\n\nForever 21 during its peak. Brian Kersey/Getty Images\n\nAs we often do, we found ourselves inside some messy stores over the last week (Dollar General's aisles are basically impossible to navigate). But, the highlight was a trip made via time machine to Forever 21's heyday, in light of the company's bankruptcy filing.\n\nBethany Biron brought us back to the days of low-rise jeans and going-out tops. She even found baby Zendaya and Nick Jonas posing for photos in stores. I'm hoping for an #RIPForever21 Instagram post from the ex-Disney stars soon, joining other twenty-somethings in mourning for the fast-fashion brand.\n\nRead the full bedazzled story here.\n\nWorkers' worries.\n\nHayley was first to report that Kroger is laying off of hundreds of workers.\n\nThe company said in a statement on Wednesday that its store operating divisions were \"evaluating middle management roles and team structures with an eye toward keeping resources close to the customer.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nThe brands are at it again.\n\n#McRibSZN. Robson90/Shutterstock\n\nThe McRib will be back starting next week! McDonald's told me the polarizing sandwich will be available at more than 10,000 locations, which is more locations than any year in recent history.\n\nMcDonald's is celebrating the McRib's return with the hashtag #McRibSZN.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nI wish I wrote this.\n\nThe New York Times talked to the woman who crashed the Chanel Fashion Show in Paris. Chanel isn't really a brand we cover on retail, but I wish I had interviewed \"professional gate-crasher\" Marie Benoliel.\n\nHere's Benoliel on being forced off the runway by model Gigi Hadid: \"I think it's really funny and I love Gigi and I think now we can be close friends. She thought I was a crazy girl. But she's right. She's right actually.\"\n\nRead the full story at The Times.\n\nEverything else you need to know.\n\nA Sexy Beyond Burger is key to understanding branding.
