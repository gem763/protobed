Well, actually, he didn\u2019t make toast; rather, he would make the most delicious, perfect squares of immaculately fried bread. It seems obvious when you think about it, for however well-toasted is a slice of bread \u2013 even the most accommodating of crusty sourdough \u2013 it will, inevitably, begin to slightly sog about halfway through munching. But a nicely thick slice of fried bread will hold its own until the last mouthful. Always the thoughtful and considered cook, my dear old dad.\n\nHis mother, not the most inspired, kitchen-wise, would have simply opened a can of Chesswood creamed mushrooms and warmed them through on the Aga. Bbut she did fry the bread. . \u2026 though possibly not as well as did her son. His trick was to lightly spread each surface with a smear of good dripping, then fry it on each side in a dry frying pan until super-crisp. His mushrooms were always button, cut in half, stewed in butter, a dusting of flour added and then milk stirred in until a smooth, thick-ish sauce was achieved; if there was some cream (or top-of-milk) in the fridge, a spoonful or two of that to finish. I have always believed he wanted to recreate that can of Chesswood\u2019s but simply because our mother would never have countenanced such slovenly convenience, he made them his own.\n\nShall we upgrade a little? We shall. Then creamed morels on fried bread, it shall be.\n\nServes 2\n\ndried morels 20g (the tinier, the finer)\n\nboiled water 150g\n\nbutter a thick slice\n\nsalt and pepper\n\nwhite bread 2 thick-ish slices, crustless\n\nduck fat or butter\n\nmedium sherry 50g\n\ndry vermouth 50g\n\nshallot 1 small, chopped\n\ngarlic a scrap, crushed\n\nflour 1 tsp\n\nwhipping cream 100g\n\nlemon juice a healthy squeeze\n\nchives \u00bd tbsp, snipped\n\nPut the morels into a bowl, cover with the boiling water and leave to soak for at least 30 minutes. Lift out with a slotted spoon into a small saucepan, pop in the butter and add a little seasoning. Put to cook over a very low light, stirring together until the butter has melted and allow to stew for about 10 minutes, covered, really slowly.\n\nSparsely spread the white bread with duck fat (or butter) and quietly fry on each side until golden and crisp.\n\nStrain the morel-soaking liquid, using a tea strainer, into another small saucepan and add the sherry, vermouth, shallot and garlic. Simmer until reduced by about two-thirds.\n\nAdd the flour to the morels, stir around for a minute or 2, then strain in the reduced morel liquor. Simmer till thickened, then stir in the cream. Continue to simmer, uncovered, for a few minutes until the sauce is nicely clinging to the morels and is of a lovely ivory colour. Stir in the lemon juice and chives, then carefully spoon over the fried bread; sprinkle over a few extra chives, if you wish, just to pretty the thing. Eat at once.\n\nThe new edition of Simon Hopkinson\u2019s The Vegetarian Option (Quadrille, \u00a312.99) is out now\n\nChicken with quince and cider by Henriette Helstrup and Allan Jenkins\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chicken with quince and cider by Henriette Helstrup and Allan Jenkins.

Originally from a lost newspaper cutting, and tweaked over the years.\n\nServes 4\n\nchicken 1 medium, the best you can afford\n\ngarlic 3 cloves\n\nlemon \u00bd\n\nsalt, pepper and paprika to taste\n\nbutter a generous knob, enough to brown the chicken\n\nsmall quince 4, halved\n\ndry cider 500ml\n\nPreheat your oven to 200C/gas mark 6.\n\nTrim the chicken of excess fat and skin. Peel and slice the garlic and cut into thin slivers, insert under the chicken skin at regular intervals. Rub the bird with the half lemon, squeezing the juice over it. Season sparingly with salt, more liberally with pepper, and paprika if you like it.\n\nHeat the butter in a cast iron casserole and lightly brown the chicken all over. Remove the bird and stuff it with as much of the quince as you can. Return it to the pan with any remaining quince tucked in around it and pour the cider over. Bring to a simmer. Cover with a lid and place in the oven. After an hour, remove the chicken, place it on an ovenproof dish and return to the oven to crisp the skin.\n\nMeanwhile, sieve the juices from the pot and reduce on the hob until syrupy, then reserve to serve with the roasted bird.\n\nThanks to Fine Food Specialist for sourcing the quinces\n\nAnna Jones\u2019s maple toffee apple and pear crisp\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anna Jones\u2019s maple toffee apple and pear crisp Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer\n\nThis is everything I want in an autumn pudding. Melting orchard fruits spiked with ginger and cardamom and a topping that\u2019s half crisp and half crumble, which reminds me of oatmeal cookies. I eat this with thick Greek yogurt mixed with a little honey and vanilla or, if it\u2019s really cold, good hot vanilla custard.\n\nServes 4-6\n\napples 3\n\npears 3\n\nmaple syrup 2 tbsp\n\nprunes 75g\n\ndried figs 50g\n\ncandied ginger, 2 pieces, finely chopped\n\nunwaxed lemon 1\n\nvanilla pod 1, seeds scraped (or 1 tsp vanilla paste)\n\nground cinnamon \u00bd tsp\n\nground cardamom \u00bd tsp\n\nFor the topping\n\nrolled oats 100g\n\nground almonds 50g\n\nbutter or coconut oil 100g\n\nlight brown sugar 75g\n\nwhite spelt flour 100g\n\nsalt a small pinch\n\nTo serve\n\nGreek or coconut yogurt whipped with a little vanilla and honey\n\nPreheat your oven to 200C/gas mark 6.\n\nPeel the apples and pears and roughly slice them. Toss them with the maple syrup in a roasting tray and cover the tray with foil. Roast for 15 minutes in the hot oven, then remove the foil and roast for a further 10 minutes until the edges catch and caramelise.\n\nMeanwhile, roughly chop 50g of the prunes and all the figs, finely chop the ginger, and place the whole lot into the bottom of a 24cm round (or equivalently sized) baking dish. Grate over the lemon zest and add the juice of \u00bd the lemon, add the vanilla and spices and mix everything together. Cover the dish with a clean tea towel and leave to one side.\n\nMake the topping by rubbing the oats, almonds, butter, sugar, flour and salt together with your fingers. It will feel wetter than a crumble topping and you\u2019ll be left with larger pieces of butter, but you should have a very rough crumbly dough after about 4 minutes. Chop the remaining prunes roughly and mix them through too.\n\nWhen your apples are ready, mix them with the fruit and spices in the baking dish, then sprinkle over the topping. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes, until deep golden.\n\nI serve mine with some Greek or coconut yogurt, whipped with a little vanilla and honey.\n\nFrom The Modern Cook\u2019s Year: Over 250 vibrant vegetable recipes to see you through the seasons by Anna Jones (Fourth Estate, \u00a326)\n\nClaudia Roden\u2019s tagliatelle with white truffles\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer\n\nPiedmontese tagliatelle, called tajarin, with butter and parmesan are one of the best ways to enjoy a white truffle because they do not interfere with its sensational aroma. The Piedmontese white truffles are the most prized and extremely expensive. They must be used very fresh as they lose their aroma at an accelerating pace \u2013 their season is between the end of September and mid January \u2013 or preserved in jars or tins, which are not quite as scented as fresh ones.\n\nServes 4\n\nwhite truffle 1 small\n\nunsalted butter 125g\n\nparmesan 40g, grated\n\nsalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nnutmeg a grating\n\ntagliatelle 300g, or fettuccine\n\nTruffles are generally exported already cleaned. If you need to clean your white truffle, scrub it with a stiff brush and rub it with a moist cloth. Melt the butter and add the grated parmesan and a little salt, pepper and nutmeg. Boil the tagliatelle or fettuccine until al dente, drain quickly and serve immediately, tossed with the melted butter mixture. Shave a little white truffle over each serving with a mandolin or a potato peeler.\n\nVariation\n\nBlack summer truffles from Umbria are relatively cheap \u2013 you can buy them fresh in season from October to March \u2013 and they are available preserved in jars in some British supermarkets. Their flavour is not as sensational as that of white truffles but it is distinctive and delicate. For 2 small portions of Umbrian tagliatelle con tartufi nerri, cook 100g tagliatelle and prepare the sauce at the same time: bring to the boil 200ml double cream with a few drops of truffle oil (to taste), 2 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan, a little salt and a finely grated small black truffle. When the tagliatelle are al dente, drain and mix them in the pan with the truffle sauce.\n\nFrom The Food of Italy by Claudia Roden (Square Peg, \u00a330)\n\nYasmin Khan\u2019s red lentil and squash soup with za\u2019atar croutons\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yasmin Khan\u2019s red lentil and squash soup with za\u2019atar croutons. Photograph: Matt Russell\n\nZa\u2019atar is a Palestinian spice mix made from wild thyme, sesame and sumac that has an affinity with sweet root vegetables. Here it is used to make crunchy, tangy croutons to adorn an aromatic soup of roasted butternut squash and spiced lentils. Roasting the squash intensifies its flavour and sweetness, and gives the soup a glorious silky texture that perfectly contrasts with the crispy croutons.\n\nServes 4\n\nbutternut squash 1kg, peeled, deseeded and cut into 3cm pieces\n\nlight olive oil\n\nonions 2, finely chopped\n\ngarlic 4 cloves, crushed\n\ncumin seeds \u00be tsp\n\ncoriander seeds \u00be tsp\n\nground cinnamon \u00bd tsp\n\nred lentils 160g, rinsed\n\nvegetable or chicken stock 750ml\n\nlemon juice of \u00bd\n\nsea salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nFor the toppings\n\nstale bread 2 slices (I like to use sourdough for taste and texture)\n\nza\u2019atar 2 tbsp\n\nextra virgin olive oil\n\nparsley or coriander leaves chopped\n\nPreheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.\n\nPlace the butternut squash on a baking tray and drizzle with light olive oil. Toss the chunks so they are evenly coated in the oil, then roast for 20-30 minutes, until they are soft.\n\nHeat 3 tablespoons light olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onions and fry for 10 minutes over a medium heat. Add the garlic, reduce the heat and cook for another few minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, toast the cumin and coriander seeds by stirring them in a dry pan over a low heat for a minute until their aromas are released. Grind the seeds in a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, then add them and the cinnamon to the saucepan with the softened onions. Fry the spices for a few minutes.\n\nAdd the lentils and 1 litre of just-boiled water. Cover and simmer the soup for 10 minutes.\n\nOnce the lentils have softened, add the squash, stock, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and \u00bd teaspoon pepper. Leave to simmer for another 10 minutes.\n\nOnce the lentils are fully cooked, take the pan off the heat and blend the soup with a hand-held blender. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your preference.\n\nTo make the croutons, roughly chop the bread into 3cm chunks. Heat 3 tablespoons light olive oil in a frying pan and, once it is very hot, add the bread and sprinkle over the za\u2019atar. Fry the bread, stirring frequently, until it is toasted and crunchy. Place the croutons on some kitchen paper to soak up any excess oil. To serve, ladle the soup into warmed bowls, top with the croutons and finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkling of chopped herbs.\n\nFrom Zaitoun: Recipes and Stories from the Palestinian Kitchen by Yasmin Khan (Bloomsbury, \u00a326)", "description": "Anna Jones\u2019s apple and pear crisp and Claudia Roden\u2019s tagliatelle \u2013 our favourite recipes for when the nights draw in", "authors": ["Claudia Roden", "Allan Jenkins", "Yasmin Khan", "Simon Hopkinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44c85845ea0d39fdfbcedec8fbe1b5092def5e5f/0_3382_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f6c6a7158d8772a142338cf39a2bba52", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
