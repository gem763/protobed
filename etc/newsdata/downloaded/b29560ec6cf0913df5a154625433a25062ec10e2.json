It\u2019s a centerpiece of his campaign, positioning himself against the more far-reaching \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, which would put all Americans in Medicare.\n\nThe specificity from his campaign comes days after Buttigieg ripped into Warren during Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Ohio for being evasive about how she\u2019d finance her plan. Some of Warren\u2019s allies noted that the South Bend, Indiana, mayor hadn\u2019t detailed his pay-fors beyond broadly calling for \u201ccost savings and corporate tax reform.\u201d\n\nButtigieg said he would repeal the corporate tax cut in the 2017 Republican tax law enacted under Trump, which lowered the rate to 21% from 35%. That would raise an estimated $1.4 trillion, according to the non-partisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of that can be recovered by rolling back the corporate tax rate cut portion of the Trump tax cuts,\u201d Buttigieg said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d\n\nNegotiating Prices\n\nSavett said Buttigieg would also seek savings by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, capping out-of-pocket pharmaceutical costs and imposing penalties on drug companies that raise prices at a higher rate than inflation.\n\nButtigieg is competing for fourth place in the Democratic race with California Senator Kamala Harris at 5% to 6% in national polls, behind Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sanders. He\u2019s positioning himself as an alternative to Biden for moderate Democrats while ratcheting up his opposition to ideas from the left wing of the party.\n\nWarren has risen in the polls while attracting college-educated white voters who are key to Buttigieg\u2019s path to the nomination. She has dodged questions about what taxes she\u2019d raise to finance \u201cMedicare For All,\u201d saying only that, \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t just how she talks about it; the problem is the multitrillion-dollar hole,\u201d Buttigieg said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d He said that would be the case \u201ceven if you accept what she\u2019s saying \u2014 taxes go up, premiums go down, you\u2019ll come out ahead.\u201d\n\nWarren said Sunday she\u2019s planning \u201cover the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of Medicare for All and specifically how we pay for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now the cost estimates for Medicare for All vary by trillions and trillions of dollars, and the different revenue streams for how to fund it \u2014 there are a lot of,\u201d she said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa. \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been working on for months and months and it\u2019s got just a little more work until it\u2019s finished.\u201d\n\n(Updates with Warren comment from 10th paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sahil Kapur in Washington at skapur39@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Wendy Benjaminson at wbenjaminson@bloomberg.net, Mark Niquette, Linus Chua\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Pete Buttigieg would pay for his $1.5 trillion health-care plan by rolling back President Donald Trump\u2019s corporate tax cut to return the rate to 35% and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, campaign spokesman Sean Savett said.Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d plan would", "authors": ["Sahil Kapur"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
