The bureau is investigating FlightHub Group for allegedly charging hidden fees for services including seat selection and flight cancellation.(The Logic)\n\nTalking point: This is the first agreement with a tech firm the bureau has reached since commissioner Matthew Boswell laid out a sweeping vision for tech enforcement in an end-of-summer interview with The Logic. At the time, Boswell said he\u2019d like to see bigger fines and more collaboration with international partners. This case has the potential for both. The state of California is currently suing justfly.com for allegedly \u201cswindling\u201d customers. The company says the claims in the lawsuit are baseless and that it\u2019s cooperating with the bureau\u2019s investigation. Regulatory enforcement aside, October has been a strong month for FlightHub. Last week, the company announced four new executive hires to help with international expansion, following an announcement it would expand its Montreal headquarters and create hundreds of jobs in Quebec.", "description": "", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
