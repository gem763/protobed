Willem was just \u2018Go-go-go-go-go Gadget\u2019 Willem all the time. But that\u2019s the character dynamic. As the director, you don\u2019t need to be a sadistic, Kubrickian manipulator to try to tease these tensions out \u2014 in fact, I just want everyone to be as comfortable and happy as they can be \u2014 but the camera sees the truth.\u201d\n\nLoosely inspired by the real-life undoing of two Welsh men \u2014 an 1801 incident now referred to as \u201cthe tragedy of Smalls Lighthouse\u201d \u2014 the film transports audiences to the past with its black-and-white imagery and 1.19:1 aspect ratio, shot through lenses designed in the early 20th century. Eggers worked with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke to fulfill the vision he had when his brother Max, with whom he wrote the script, mentioned years ago that he had been working on a ghost story set in a lighthouse.\n\nThere\u2019s a specific \u201ckind of bleakness and extreme texture that is achieved only with black and white,\u201d Eggers said, explaining how the boxy aspect ratio, reminiscent of the early sound era, was helpful for framing tall objects like the tower and \u201calso very good for meaty close-ups of two of the greatest faces that have ever been born.\u201d\n\nDafoe and Pattinson share an electric chemistry that carries the film, given that they\u2019re the only characters we ever encounter (with the exception of brief appearances by Valeriia Karaman\u2019s shrieking mermaid and a very aggressive seagull). Their path to doom is hinted at from the start, when Thomas Wake (Dafoe), a brutish man who has been on the rock for so long that he describes himself as \u201cdamn near married to this here light,\u201d informs his new apprentice, Ephraim Winslow (Pattinson), that the latter\u2019s predecessor died after raving about sirens and some sort of \u201cenchantment\u201d in the tower\u2019s light.\n\nBoth actors said they were cast in the two-hander after, beguiled by \u201cThe Witch,\u201d they reached out to Eggers and pledged to work with the rising indie director sometime in the near future.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDafoe was especially drawn to the specificity of Eggers\u2019s vision, he said, as \u201cone of the strongest things a director can do is make the world detailed and articulate and deep \u2026 so when you enter it, it\u2019s much more easy to pretend.\u201d His character, Wake, delivers the bulk of the film\u2019s dialogue in long-winded speeches to Winslow, who conversely declares that he \u201cain\u2019t much for talkin'.\u201d\n\nEggers, whom Dafoe considers an \u201cobsessive researcher,\u201d provided the actors with recordings and videos of lighthouse keepers to help them nail the accent Dafoe described as a mix of West Country English and \u201cthe Robert Newton kind of classic pirate.\u201d He likes to rehearse \u2014 a trait Eggers attributed to his background in theater \u2014 and in his spare time often invited Eggers over to the fisherman\u2019s shack he stayed in so he could run lines in the accent. (Eggers said he and his brother got so carried away writing dialogue like Wake\u2019s \u201cfaux-Shakespearean sea curse\u201d that Dafoe asked them to cut it down.)\n\n\u201cIt was mostly studying, reading, getting fake teeth made, growing a beard \u2026 learning how to keep a clay pipe lit while I\u2019m doing these big speeches,\u201d Dafoe said of his preparation for the role. \u201cIt\u2019s a swirl of experience that helps you enter the world, but you can\u2019t do it fully until you\u2019re really there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d in this case, was Cape Forchu, a small fishing community along the southern coast of Nova Scotia with rough conditions that shaped the actors\u2019 performances in ways they couldn\u2019t predict. (A portion of the 35-day shoot also took place on soundstages in Halifax, a city about a three-hour drive away.)\n\n\u201cWe chose that location because it was punishing and had terrible weather and would give us what we needed for the story, and it delivered on that,\u201d Eggers said of the high winds, pouring rain and slightly-above-freezing temperatures. Most of the film\u2019s weather events were real \u2014 a few milder days required rain machines \u2014 but \u201cobviously, when you have waves crashing and it\u2019s Robert Pattinson trying to launch a ship, that\u2019s done in a controlled way so we don\u2019t lose Rob to a riptide.\u201d\n\nDafoe found the scenes where a shirtless Wake basks in the light at the top of the tower to be his most physically challenging, as \u201chigh-velocity winds aren\u2019t too good, particularly when you\u2019re naked and it\u2019s raining.\u201d Pattinson, asked about obstacles he faced, instead recalled his amusement while filming a scene in which Winslow is covered in all sorts of debris. (This is a tamer stop on the character\u2019s journey to insanity, which also includes him chugging kerosene and masturbating to a mermaid figurine.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t really see anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing blind, naked and having various people artistically arrange s--- all over your naked body, that was an unusual thing to do. Sort of a strange spa treatment.\u201d\n\nPattinson initially noticed the film\u2019s \u201cstrikingly strange script,\u201d which spends a good amount of time in an even-paced, dour zone and switches to a \u201cturbocharged surrealist thing\u201d in its final act. Winslow opens up as the film progresses (or spills his beans, as Wake puts it) and reveals himself to be a man on the run from his tragic past \u2014 not unlike other characters Pattinson has played in his recent indie films, including the space-traveling death row inmate from Claire Denis\u2019s \u201cHigh Life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find it\u2019s much more fun to play actors who don\u2019t know who they are,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt opens you up in how you play individual scenes, because you don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to play it until you\u2019re there. \u2026 My instinct is to go as dark as possible. But when another actor comes in, it feels like a really abstract energy you\u2019re playing against. It\u2019s always a little bit funnier and lighter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf somebody else played Willem\u2019s part in \u2018The Lighthouse,\u2019 it could be the most brutal, horrible drama. But there\u2019s something about the anarchic energy Willem brings. No matter how dark he is, there\u2019s always something pretty entertaining about him.\u201d\n\nCritics have praised Dafoe and Pattinson, who seem perfectly suited to their roles in a film that is equal parts melodramatic and absurd \u2014 a casting success story Eggers said he cannot explain beyond calling it a hunch.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both actors who like to take risks, who like to do strange, challenging work, who like to seek out auteurs and wannabe auteurs like myself and really stretch themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, they both have noses and cheekbones and teeth, and they almost look related sometimes, which is nice. On the cover of Esquire UK, they\u2019re like a long-lost sexy vampire father and son.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d opens Friday in select cities.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The actors join director Robert Eggers in spilling the beans on \"The Lighthouse,\" a darkly comedic thriller about 19th-century lighthouse keepers who drive each other mad.", "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YjdAwcqg7Qb3uVUOV4P9_1jbQhY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OZBYQR4LYNC2LK3ZMUYGKI3LOA.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
