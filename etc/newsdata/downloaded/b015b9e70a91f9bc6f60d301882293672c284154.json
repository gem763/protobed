Along the way she has become very popular herself, a figure they may have allowed to become too imposing to take down.\n\nButtigieg needs a standout moment.\n\nIn the first debate, Mr. Buttigieg defended his record on race relations at the South Bend Police Department. In the second one, he faded into the background while Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders owned the conversation about health care.\n\nNow, as his campaign begins spending down his field-leading financial war chest, Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s debate challenge is to shift from curiosity to serious candidate. He\u2019s been a nonentity the first two times Democrats have debated in the presidential primary and he can\u2019t afford a third tepid showing.\n\nThe challenge for the 37-year-old is how to present himself as a breath of fresh air and steward for a new generation of politics without getting his hands dirty by attacking others onstage. His contrast with Mr. Biden is implicit \u2014 the former vice president is nearly 40 years older \u2014 but if he is going to make the argument that he can build a broader coalition than his more liberal opponents, that may require some explaining to a still-skeptical electorate.\n\nMany are vying for Biden\u2019s center-left supporters.\n\nBelow the marquee matchup between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, perhaps the most intriguing subplot onstage will be among the candidates stuck in the single-digits in polling trying to position themselves as the leading, less ideological alternative to Mr. Biden.\n\nFor now, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders seem to dominate the left. Who can emerge as Mr. Biden\u2019s leading rival for the center-left?\n\nThe various candidates each have different theories of the case. Mr. Buttigieg has been making a generational argument, though he has increasingly waded into more centrist and unifying grounds. \u201cWe need real solutions, not more polarization,\u201d he said in his first TV ad that aired in Iowa.", "description": "Tonight\u2019s lineup will feature 10 candidates including the former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.", "authors": ["Shane Goldmacher", "Reid J.
