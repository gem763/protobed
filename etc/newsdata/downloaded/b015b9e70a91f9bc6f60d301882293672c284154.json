The most illuminating exchanges were not between Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Elizabeth Warren, who met onstage for the first time, but from other pairings. Here are six highlights from the debate.\n\nIt was the best of Biden, and the Biden of Biden.\n\nOnce again this debate season, Mr. Biden came under the fiercest and most sustained scrutiny, from his ideological foes, from a former cabinet mate and even from the moderators. He was pushed on race, on deportations, on health care and, in an intense exchange, on his age.\n\nBut in the end, Mr. Biden exited the stage the same way he entered it: the embattled-yet-clear front-runner, no matter if his meandering syntax and twisting verbal gymnastics sometimes failed to land clear points.\n\n", "description": "Joe Biden hugged Barack Obama tightly as the former vice president came under attack from Bernie Sanders and Juli\u00e1n Castro.
