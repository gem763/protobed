(AP) - Packing 240 pounds on his 6-foot frame, Royce Freeman is four inches taller and 50 pounds heavier than Phillip Lindsay.\n\nYet, Freeman isn\u2019t just blasting through the beefy lineman and freeing up Lindsay to slip out of the backfield to catch passes away from the trenches where he can square off against D-backs more his size.\n\nBoth Freeman and Lindsay have 53 yards receiving so far and Freeman is averaging 8.8 yards a catch to Lindsay\u2019s 6.6. (He\u2019s also averaging 5.2 yards a rush to Lindsay\u2019s 3.3).\n\nThese are the early returns on Freeman\u2019s offseason quest to remake his game after injuries limited the Oregon Ducks\u2019 career rushing leader and third-round draft pick to eight starts as a rookie. That cleared the way for Lindsay , who starred at Colorado, to get more work and emerge as the first undrafted offensive rookie to make the Pro Bowl.\n\nFreeman\u2019s goal: to join Lindsay and the rest of the NFL\u2019s new breed of versatile running backs accessorizing offenses, confusing defenses and increasing their value to both their team and their bank accounts.\n\nIt\u2019s paying off for Freeman and the Broncos (0-2), who visit the Green Bay Packers (2-0) on Sunday in search of the franchise\u2019s 500th victory and coach Vic Fangio\u2019s first.\n\n\u201cI think everyone thought Phillip was that guy, that dynamic guy,\u201d offensive coordinator Rich Scangarello said. \u201cBut the thing about Royce is he\u2019s instinctive. He doesn\u2019t need a lot of reps to learn. So, even though he\u2019s a little bit bigger, he\u2019s really got a good feel for the pass game.\u201d\n\nTurning running backs loose in space is another of the college spread concepts that have permeated the pro game in recent years, and the Broncos now have two of these versatile running backs to rotate and keep defenses off-balance.\n\n\u201cThe whole goal is to get guys involved in space and let them be dynamic in that area,\u201d Scangarello said. \u201cRoyce has the ability to be a complete player: a protection back, a runner and a pass-catcher and when you find that you\u2019re lucky to have that.\u201d\n\nScangarello saw the blossoming of the versatile running back who takes less of a pounding at the line of scrimmage and gets to display his athleticism in open space.\n\n\u201cFor us it was in 2015 with the Falcons, I think Kyle Shanahan realized with Devonta (Freeman) what it brought to the table and it evolved into where it is today and it\u2019s continued to grow,\u201d Scangarello said. \u201cThose little epiphanies at times in your career as coordinators and coaches can take you in a whole other direction. And that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happened for us.\n\n\u201cAnd then you start looking for those traits in your players,\u201d Scangarello said. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to have those guys.\u201d\n\nBeing a hybrid running back means more touches but less wear and tear.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s easier to catch the ball out in space on a safety than it is to run between the tackles sometimes,\u201d Scangarello said. \u201cThose guys, they terrify defenders in space because they know if they miss a tackle, it\u2019s an explosive play. Yeah, I do think there\u2019s a hidden benefit in getting them touches where they\u2019re not getting banged around and you can increase their value and ability to have success in the offense.\u201d\n\nFor Freeman, the benefit of being more versatile is getting more playing time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just important for a back in general to try to be as close to an every-down back as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to do it all.\u201d\n\nWhen the NFL joined the college game in emphasizing the pass, running backs were devalued in the draft. Then came the likes of Christian McCaffrey and Saquon Barkley. Two-time rushing champion Ezekiel Elliott \u2018s value skyrocketed after he caught 77 passes last season (he averaged 29 his first two years), and he signed a $90 million contract extension with the Cowboys.\n\n\u201cYou look across the league and I think it would be foolish not to pick up on things that other great backs are doing,\u201d Freeman said.\n\nNotes: WR Courtland Sutton (ribs) returned to practice Friday. \u2026 GM John Elway said the NFL acknowledged the officials were \u201cdead wrong\u201d to flag OLB Bradley Chubb for roughing the QB that helped put the Bears into position for the game-winning field goal last weekend. Elway also said during a public business appearance that he feels better at 0-2 this season than he did last year at 0-2 because he trusts Fangio and QB Joe Flacco. \u2026 ILB Todd Davis is expected to make his 2019 debut Sunday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Packing 240 pounds on his 6-foot frame, Royce Freeman is four inches taller and 50 pounds heavier than Phillip Lindsay.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
