The last time the Patriots played on Wild Card Weekend was 2009, and it was one of their worst playoff defeats of the Tom Brady/Bill Belichick era. The Baltimore Ravens came into Gillette Stadium and beat the Patriots 33-14 in a game that was never close.\n\nThe Browns have one playoff appearance (2002) since re-entering the league in 1999. The franchise's last playoff win came in 1994 when Belichick beat the Patriots as Cleveland's head coach. The Buccaneers have enjoyed more playoff success than the Browns of late, winning Super Bowl XXXVII over the Oakland Raiders during the 2002 season and making five playoff appearance since 2000. The Bucs, however, haven't tasted postseason action since 2007.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt wouldn't be surprising if the Browns played on Wild Card weekend this season. Starting quarterback Baker Mayfield and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. lead a talented offense that has the potential to make Cleveland a real contender in the AFC, and the Browns have been a trendy pick to win the AFC North division all offseason. Picking the Patriots and/or Buccaneers to play in early January is a much tougher bet.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
