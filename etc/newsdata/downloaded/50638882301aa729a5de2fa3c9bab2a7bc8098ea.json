Our guys have done a good job with any kind of changes that we\u2019ve had to make.\u201d\n\nLuke Falk will make his second straight start. The Jets also re-signed quarterback David Fales to serve as Falk\u2019s backup.\n\nDarnold was diagnosed with mononucleosis on Sept. 11, three days after the season-opening loss to Buffalo. The initial hope was the 22-year-old quarterback might be ready to play again this week, but doctors have been monitoring Darnold\u2019s spleen, which became enlarged, a common symptom of mononucleosis. A swollen spleen could rupture - a potentially life-threatening situation - if the area takes a hit, leading to the caution with which the doctors and team are using.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s close,\u201d Gase said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not where it needs to be.\u201d\n\nDarnold was cleared Monday for non-contact activity and had been taking the bulk of the first-team snaps on offense. He was upbeat and positive while speaking to reporters Thursday, but understood the seriousness of balancing wanting to come back with making sure his health is fine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough thing because you want to stay safe,\u201d Darnold said Thursday. \u201cI want to make sure that I\u2019m safe out there, and that, you know, I\u2019m not going to die.\u201d\n\nGase said Darnold was predictably disappointed when the team gave him the test results.\n\n\u201cI felt bad for him,\u201d Gase said. \u201cWhen we told him, the first thing he says is, \u2018I feel like I\u2019m letting the other guys down.\u2019 It\u2019s not about him. He tried to do everything he could. He did everything he was asked to do. He did everything the doctors told him to do.\n\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t work out for him.\u201d\n\nThere is optimism Darnold will be able to return against Dallas on Oct. 13.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Gase said. \u201cI mean, yes would be the right answer, I guess.\u201d\n\nFor now, Falk will again lead the Jets\u2019 struggling offense.\n\nHe went 12 of 22 for 98 yards in his NFL starting debut at New England in Week 3 after opening the season on the Jets\u2019 practice squad. New York managed just 105 total yards against the Patriots and went 0 for 12 on third downs.\n\n\u201cYeah, that was not a good day for us,\u201d Gase said.\n\nFalk was pressed into action in Week 2 against Cleveland when then-starter Trevor Siemian went down with a season-ending ankle injury. Falk will get all the snaps in practice Friday, and Gase is confident the second-year quarterback will be up to speed by Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe were ready for either way,\u201d Gase said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know. Even when we started it, we didn\u2019t know. We were just trying to make sure that anything that we did was the right thing as far as play calls and things like that to make sure we didn\u2019t put (Darnold) in a bad spot if they cleared him.\u201d\n\nNOTES: DL John Franklin-Myers was placed on injured reserve. He had been dealing with a foot injury early in the season, but it is uncertain if that was what is currently ailing him. \u2026 LBs C.J. Mosley (groin) and Jordan Jenkins (calf) are unlikely to play. \u2026 Gase said WR Demaryius Thomas (hamstring) has a chance to play after being injured against Cleveland. \u201cHe\u2019s looked good in practice,\u201d Gase said. \u201cIt\u2019s looking very positive for us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sam Darnold's return will have to wait at least another week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Deenis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/jets_darnold_out_football_34327_c0-172-4110-2568_s1770x1032.jpg?4a26a4c7f191ae4ae0849f169cb026f18d731be0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
