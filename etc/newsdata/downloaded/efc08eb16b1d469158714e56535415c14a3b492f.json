Huffman pled guilty to the charges against her in the college admissions scandal, where she paid $15,000 to have her daughter\u2019s SAT scores altered.\n\n\u201cLori is aware of Felicity\u2019s sentence, and is processing what that means for her,\u201d a source told People. \u201cHer only move now is to take this to court and to prove that she is not guilty of what she\u2019s charged with.\u201d\n\nLoughlin is being accused of paying $500,000 in order to get her daughters into USC and pled not guilty after rejecting a plea deal.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s found guilty, she will go to jail; that is clear,\u201d the source says. \u201cAnd if another deal is offered to her, which I don\u2019t think it will be, she will go to jail. Her only chance of avoiding jail is to beat these charges. Lori is a smart woman; she understands that. She\u2019s scared and upset, but she\u2019s resolved to be strong and to fight this. She will do what she has to do to protect herself and her family.\u201d\n\nThe Fuller House actress is reportedly regretting not taking the plea deal, according to the source. After Huffman\u2019s sentencing, it\u2019s seeming more likely that Loughlin will have to face some jail time.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t understand the entire nature of the charges against her, and she wasn\u2019t even sure if or how she had broken the law,\u201d the source says. \u201cIt was very early, and she didn\u2019t have all the information that she has now. Based on what she understood at the time, she made the best choice for herself. Now there is no deal on the table, and she has to have faith that the courts and the prosecution will move fairly and not make an example out of her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in jail earlier this week.", "authors": ["Erika Harwood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Wwerqrf7werCSaUStt9eoA--~B/aD0xMTgwO3c9MjM1MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/8e820cd47e77857fff858464a2fc1314", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
