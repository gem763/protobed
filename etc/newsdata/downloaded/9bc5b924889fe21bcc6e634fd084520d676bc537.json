Curry, however, has been known to do exactly that \u2013 a consequence of sleepwalking in the team hotel \u2013 and his teammates have not let him forget it.\n\nSam Underhill, the other Kamikaze Kid, says he would hate to room with Curry because of it and it seems within the England squad he is not alone. They are, however, inseparable off the field \u2013 Joe Marler is in charge of fines in Japan and anyone who goes for lunch with Curry and Underhill is liable. Curry says they are \u201celectric company\u201d but, with tongue firmly in cheek, claims \u201cpeople can\u2019t handle it\u201d. He is on his own though, when it comes to the Tokyo cat cafes \u2013 coffee shops where moggies will climb all over you to your heart\u2019s content.\n\nThe Breakdown | Reffing hell: Rugby World Cup needs to clear up collision confusion Read more\n\nIncreasingly, it seems, the Kamikaze Kids are England\u2019s odd couple, but on the pitch they have hit it off to impressive effect in the three Tests they have started as Jones\u2019s first-choice flankers, so much so that Mark Wilson, arguably England\u2019s best player of the past 12 months, cannot get into the matchday squad.\n\nOf Underhill, Curry says: \u201cHe is a bit calmer. He is very relaxed and chilled, I am a bit less relaxed and chilled. That\u2019s the biggest [thing]. Apart from that, we are both pretty weird.\u201d\n\nFor Curry, the new partnership has meant a change of number of his back, moving from his natural position of openside flanker to the No 6 jersey. The 21-year-old has added five kilograms in the past 12 months, enough to convince Jones that he is suited to blindside.\n\nThe England head coach is reluctant to say exactly when it occurred to him that, rather than playing Curry or Underhill in his back row, fielding both may be the way forward. But he is clear as to why. \u201cI feel the game has moved into another cycle of contestability. The referees want low penalty counts and when you have low penalty counts it means you have a high contest, which also means you have high kicking. We thought: how can we be best equipped in that area? Curry is big enough to play six. He\u2019s got the sense to play six. We thought we\u2019d give a go in the World Cup warm-up games. He\u2019s adjusted really well to it.\u201d\n\nCurry is clearly a quick learner but he has had significant help from one of the best to ever wear England\u2019s No 6 jersey. Richard Hill is England\u2019s team manager and he has been mentoring Curry since he was playing at under-17 level. Jones also credits Hill for bringing Underhill to his attention \u2013 it would appear that he is still doing the unseen work even in retirement.\n\n\u201cIt is good to get time [at No 6] to develop,\u201d added Curry. \u201cThere are different positional traits that you need. It is about trying to adapt your game. The six role is different from the seven role. I have had a few conversations with Richard Hill and Mark Wilson. I spoke to him about how he found it and what he thought about it. Especially the way [David] Pocock adapted his role. But at the end of the day I don\u2019t think there is anything massively different. I want to stay true to myself and how I want to play and from that adapt to what the team needs after that.\u201d", "description": "Tom Curry said he is keen to cement his new role alongside Sam Underhill in Eddie Jones\u2019s side after impressing in Japan so far", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81f2938cfefc131cc45d1b8b11d8529c3456291/130_81_2789_1674/master/2789.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0dff553770912eeb279536e863b09e7b"}
