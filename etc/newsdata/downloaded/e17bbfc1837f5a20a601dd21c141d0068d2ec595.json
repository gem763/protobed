He was thought to be hiding near the Syria-Iraq border.\n\nHe was born in 1971 as Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarrai, and grew up in a middle-class family in Iraq, Ha\u2019aretz notes. He joined the Muslim Brotherhood in college, then pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the U.S. invaded Iraq, and rose through the terrorist ranks. After the U.S. withdrew from Iraq, Al-Baghdadi rose further to become the leader of ISIS.\n\nHe was occasionally mocked for his bourgeois tastes, as when he was seen wearing an expensive watch during a sermon to his followers.\n\nPresident Trump was criticized for pulling U.S. troops back from the border between Turkey and Syria as Turkish troops invaded the region to secure a \u201csafe zone\u201d free of Kurdish forces. But General Mazloum praised Trump\u2019s efforts to use economic and diplomatic pressure to push Turkey to accept a cease-fire, under the condition that Kurdish troops withdraw.\n\nKurdish forces fought alongside the U.S. in destroying the so-called ISIS \u201ccaliphate.\u201d\n\nUpdate: President Trump said from the White House on Sunday morning that the Kurds had provided intelligence, but not military support.\n\nJoel B.
