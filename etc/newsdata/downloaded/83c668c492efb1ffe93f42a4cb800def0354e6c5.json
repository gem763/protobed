Campaigners have given her the name \"Victoria\".\n\nPolice say the attack took place on 16 May. A school employee is under arrest charged with raping her.\n\nBut DNA evidence has been inconclusive and nursery staff dispute it was him.\n\nPolice say a medical examination carried out after Victoria's mother had noticed her injuries and taken her to hospital showed the girl had been sexually assaulted.\n\nA school driver called Aung Kyaw Myo, also known as Aung Gyi, was arrested in May in connection with the alleged rape. He was the released for lack of evidence before being rearrested and charged.\n\nMany believe he's been framed.\n\nThey point to CCTV footage obtained by the BBC Burmese service which shows him going into the nursery on the day of the alleged attack and apparently waiting in the reception area. It's claimed the video shows he had insufficient time to go and find Victoria and then attack her.\n\n\"It is impossible that he did it. We, all the teachers, were with the students all the time,\" Hnin Nu, one teacher questioned nine times by the police, told the BBC in July.\n\nAnother teacher, Nilar Aye, said Victoria had never left her sight on 16 May.\n\nImage copyright Supplied Image caption CCTV footage obtained by BBC Burmese shows the suspect outside the nursery\n\nThere have been widespread protests calling for justice for Victoria and for wider action to arrest an alarming rise in reported sexual assault, particularly towards children.\n\nMany Burmese are unhappy with the police handling of the case, and say the chief suspect has been made a scapegoat.\n\nGovernment figures suggest the number of all reported rapes in Myanmar has increased by 50% in the past two years. In 2018, there were said to be 1,528 attacks - in nearly two-thirds of the cases the victim was a child.\n\nCampaigners feel Victoria's story has exposed a deeply worrying trend in a country where domestic violence is still seen as a private matter.\n\nThe shame heaped upon survivors of sexual abuse means many remain silent, the BBC's Myanmar correspondent Nick Beake reported in July. Some victims are bribed, others intimidated so they take back their allegations.\n\nA new child law is set to be introduced in Myanmar which would allow police to open investigations even if nobody presses charges, but there are serious doubts about the skills and suitability of the officers who will be doing such sensitive work, our correspondent says.\n\nMyanmar (also called Burma) is still a predominantly rural country and in some communities village elders oversee complaints - alleged victims can even be encouraged to marry their attackers. Male rape is not even a recognised crime.", "description": "The case has caused outrage and protesters have been demanding justice for the three-year-old.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CE1C/production/_108746725_a977ee02-b0cc-4ffb-899c-e1f5854a3783.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
