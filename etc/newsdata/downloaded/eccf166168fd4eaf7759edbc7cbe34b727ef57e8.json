I often talk about gold as a target market cap, but that's really just the beginning...it's digital gold, source of truth, etc\u2026\u201d\n\nA shared, single \u201csource of truth\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s argument aims at going beyond the commonplace analogy of Bitcoin with gold, whose proponents compare the scarcity of the precious metal with Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply to emphasize the cryptocurrency\u2019s role as a digital store of value.\n\nWhile accepting this perspective, his accent lies on the revolutionary potential of the cryptocurrency\u2019s open-source software, which establishes a decentralized digital public record of transactions that is immutable, secure and anonymous: a shared, single source of truth.\n\nIn information systems, a Source of Truth (SOT) is a term used to denote a trusted data source that gives a complete picture of the data object as a whole.\n\nThis robust and trustless model for ensuring data integrity between a massive network of participants is, then \u2014 in Cameron\u2019s view \u2014 the foundation for the asset\u2019s unique promise.\n\nRooting out falsity\n\nCryptocurrency commentators had previously implicitly conjoined these two perspectives \u2014 on scarcity and integrity \u2014 particularly in response to the forgery crisis that plagued the gold industry this summer.\n\nThis August, roughly 1,000 fake gold kilogram bars were found in the vaults of major banks such as JPMorgan Chase \u2014 with many more thought likely to have been in circulation.\n\nAs one cryptocurrency argued at the time:", "description": "Cameron Winklevoss says Bitcoin\u2019s possibilities go beyond digital gold \u2014 it can be a \u201csource of truth\u201d and that this is just the beginning", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMWE3ZjgxMTI0MGFlMDAzN2NlYjdmNzZmMDM0M2ZkNTcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
