So yes, we are worried if we can't step back and have countries strike the right balance.\"", "description": "The US company's president warns of a \"digital iron curtain down the Pacific Ocean\".", "authors": ["Leo Kelion", "Technology Desk Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5E0C/production/_108867042_85145e49-b824-4948-888e-81d1990c005f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
