The first trailer is here. USA TODAY\n\nPaul Walter Hauser found out firsthand how passionately director Clint Eastwood felt about his movie on Richard Jewell, the security guard who discovered the bomb in Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 Summer Olympics concert \u2013 only to be smeared as the deadly explosion's prime suspect.\n\nHauser met with Eastwood in April to discuss the unfairly maligned hero, now the subject of \"Richard Jewell\" (in theaters Dec. 13). The filmmaker shared a first look with USA TODAY ahead of the film's first trailer, which arrived Thursday.\n\n\"Clint seemed broken up about the story of Richard Jewell. It still bothered him years later,\" says Hauser, 32. \"He sounded like he was hurting for that family, and wanted the story to come out.\"\n\nWho is Paul Walter Hauser? He starred as grandiose bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt in 'I, Tonya'\n\nEastwood, 89, walked away from the meeting knowing he had found the perfect actor to play Jewell, alongside Sam Rockwell as the security guard's crusading lawyer Watson Bryant and Kathy Bates as Jewell's mother Bobi.\n\nThe director didn't even ask Hauser, best known for playing bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt in \"I, Tonya,\" to audition.\n\n\"So we met, and I thought, \u201cThat\u2019s our guy, that\u2019s him,' \" Eastwood says by email. \"Not only does he look enough like Richard, but he has an 'every guy' quality that I felt would allow him to disappear into the part.\"\n\nThe day after the attack, the real Richard Jewell poses across from the tower where he found a bomb and warned visitors at Centennial Olympic Park.

The quick-acting Jewel spotted an abandoned green knapsack containing the bomb, bringing it to police attention as he started moving visitors away from the area.\n\nThe impact would have been much worse if Jewell hadn't raised the alarm in the blast, which killed one and wounded 111.\n\n\"The moment he knew there was a bomb in Centennial Park, Richard was all hands on deck, throwing people out of the way, alerting everyone,\" says Hauser. \"Had he not said anything, who knows how many people would have died?\"\n\nBut the FBI (Jon Hamm plays an agent) and the media (Olivia Wilde stars as a reporter) aggressively profiled Jewell as a suspect.\n\nWatson Bryant (Sam Rockwell) looks on as Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser, right) comforts his mother Bobi (Kathy Bates). (Photo: CLAIRE FOLGER/WARNER BROS.)\n\n\"Elements of law enforcement, put under pressure, found what they deemed to be evidence to fit a previously-decided-upon narrative,\" says Hauser. \"This is a guy that got screwed over.\"\n\nThe crew shot many scenes in the original Atlanta locations, including Bobi Jewell's apartment. On July 27, the anniversary of the attack, filmmakers re-created Jewell's actions as the crime unfolded.\n\n\"So that night, 23 years later, I was in Centennial Park, pretending the bomb was going off right where I stood,\" Hauser says. \"That was powerful.\"\n\nPaul Walter Hauser (as Richard Jewell), Sam Rockwell (as lawyer Watson Bryant) and director Clint Eastwood on the set of \"Richard Jewell.\" (Photo: CLAIRE FOLGER/WARNER BROS.)\n\nThe drama has already generated enough excitement at Warner Bros. studioto expedite the editing process and ensure the awards-friendly release date, which surprised even Oscar winner Rockwell.\n\n\"I\u2019ve never had this kind of turnaround, it\u2019s incredible,\" says Rockwell. \"No flies on Clint; he's done a lot movies and doesn\u2019t mess around.\"\n\nJewell was exonerated and died in 2007 at age 44 (Eric Rudolph is serving a life sentence for the attack after pleading guilty in 2005) for the bombing and three others). But Eastwood believes \"Richard Jewell\" will draw attention to his true story.\n\n\"Richard is long gone, but this is really a tribute to him,\" he says.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/02/clint-eastwood-reveals-his-richard-jewell-star-paul-walter-hauser/3838645002/", "description": "Clint Eastwood's 'Richard Jewell' stars Paul Walter Hauser as the Olympic bombing hero wrongly suspected of the crime.
