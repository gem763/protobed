Trump then welcomed the child by tapping on the head with the candy bar, as if making sure someone is inside the puffy yellow consume.\n\nTrump ignored the minion\u2019s outstretched hands and candy bag, and instead opted to place the candy bar directly on the child\u2019s head. Melania then mimiced him and puts a second candy bar on top of the inflatable costume.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the candy ded not remain on the minion\u2019s rounded head for long. It slid off and fell to the floor almost immediately, but a staffer picked it up and places it in the child\u2019s bag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump and Melania appeared to find the strange situation humorous and could briefly be seen laughing to themselves. The minion remained nearby for a moment before shuffling away.\n\n'Baby killer who battered son to death' convicted of raping eight year-old girl\n\nClips of the bizarre interaction were shared online as people joked about the president\u2019s trouble with the minion.\n\nOne Twitter user said: \u2018Disrespecting the Minions could hurt Trump in key 2020 battleground states.\u2019\n\nAnother tweeted: \u2018If you don\u2019t think Trump skipping over Spider-Man to give the minion a chocolate bar on his head instead of his treat bag is the best moment of his presidency, I don\u2019t think we can be friends.\u2019\n\nOne Reddit saw the interaction as symbolic of the country and joked: \u2018It\u2019s like the minion is America waiting for trickle-down economics.\u2019", "description": "This is the strange moment Donald Trump and Melania placed chocolate bars on one young trick-or-treater's head.
