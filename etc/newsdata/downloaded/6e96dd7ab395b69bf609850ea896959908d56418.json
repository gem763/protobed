This compares to FFO of $1.35 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 0.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $1.13 per share when it actually produced FFO of $1.18, delivering a surprise of 4.42%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.\n\nSun Communities, which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry, posted revenues of $362.44 million for the quarter ended September 2019, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.16%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $323.54 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nSun Communities shares have added about 53% since the beginning of the year versus the 's gain of 19.5%.\n\nWhat's Next for Sun Communities?\n\nWhile Sun Communities has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Sun Communities was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The current consensus FFO estimate is $1.09 on $293.01 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.88 on $1.22 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.
