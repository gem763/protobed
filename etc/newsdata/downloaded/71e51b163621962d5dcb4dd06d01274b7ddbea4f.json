Ted Cruz over gun control that started on Twitter.\n\nMs. Lightfoot\u2019s anger with the Texas Republican began after he tweeted in response to a deadly Labor Day weekend for the Windy City: \u201cGun control doesn\u2019t work. Look at Chicago. Disarming law-abiding citizens isn\u2019t the answer.\u201d\n\nThe remark led to a testy back-and-forth between Mr. Cruz and the Democratic mayor, who warned Mr. Cruz to \u201ckeep our name out of your mouth\u201d and said the debate between the two is better served via newspaper columns and in-person visits than on Twitter.\n\nIn the Post op-ed published Sunday, Ms. Lightfoot challenged Mr. Cruz to come to Chicago and talk with residents \u201cas people, not just as \u2018Democrats\u2019 or a rhetorical device,\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you dare lecture us with half-truths, cherry-picked statistics and debunked rhetoric designed to score political points with your base and your donors while you, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the other Republicans in charge of the Senate sit in dereliction of your duty day after day, shooting after shooting,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe mayor reasserted her statistic from their first exchange that 60% of firearms \u201cowned or used illegally recovered in Chicago come from outside Illinois\u201d before inviting Mr. Cruz to Chicago.\n\n\u201cIt is our highest priority to rebuild communities that have been harmed for generations by disinvestment, racism and gang violence,\u201d Ms. Lightfoot wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re making gradual, but critical, progress.\u201d\n\nMs. Lightfoot concluded that \u201cthe stakes are too high to continue business as usual.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
