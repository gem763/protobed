By which we mean, of course, worse and worse. At least as far as the New York Times is concerned.\n\nThe Washington Examiner\u2019s Jerry Dunleavy has more details that for some reason failed to garner the same attention as the original New York Times story:\n\nBut Keyser now says she lacks confidence in Ford\u2019s account. \u201cWe spoke multiple times to Keyser, who also said that she didn\u2019t recall that get-together or others like it,\u201d Pogrebin and Kelly wrote. \u201cIn fact, she challenged Ford\u2019s accuracy.\u201d \u201cThose facts together I don\u2019t recollect, and it just didn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Keyser told the authors. \u2026 \u201cIt would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she\u2019s getting home,\u201d Keyser told Pogrebin and Kelly. \u201cI just really didn\u2019t have confidence in the story.\u201d Pogrebin and Kelly, however, say Ford\u2019s story \u201crings true\u201d and challenged Keyser\u2019s recollections. \u201cIt is possible that Ford\u2019s account is wrong and that Keyser\u2019s lack of recollection is proof of that,\u201d they wrote, but said \u201cKeyser\u2019s memory might be affected by her struggles with alcohol and other substances.\u201d\n\nAnd speaking of Keyser\u2019s struggles with substance abuse, it seems that some of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s friends tried to exploit that in order to aid in the takedown of Brett Kavanaugh:\n\n\u201cI was told behind the scenes that certain things could spread about me if I didn't comply.\u201d\n\n\u2014Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s friend Leland Keyser (who now says she doubts Ford\u2019s story on Kavanaugh) Here\u2019s a small sampling of the machinations by Ford\u2019s friends.https://t.co/FQxVc7Td0p pic.twitter.com/TBJsHypdYj \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) September 16, 2019\n\nWow.\n\nIt's one of the most disgusting things I've ever read. \u2014 Reagan & Maverick (@AngleOfAttack1) September 16, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s really sad, and very telling, they also wanted to shame her due to addiction/sobriety issues, and cruelly weaponize it to force her to play along\u2026 Breathtaking hypocrisy \u2014 Eric AllredHenriquez (@epallred) September 16, 2019\n\nThis seems like it should be front-page news, no? Did the New York Times just not have enough space for this stuff or \u2026 ?\n\nIm sure we will be seeing all the real moral and firefighting gatekeepers of truth who were eager to ruin this mans life tweet about this This seem really newsy\u2026 like really newsy\u2026 https://t.co/v4hRmlHjOG \u2014 Bob Malak (@bob_malak) September 16, 2019\n\nThis is crazy stuff.
