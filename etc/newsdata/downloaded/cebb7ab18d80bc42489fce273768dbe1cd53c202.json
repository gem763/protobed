Throughout the month of October, fans have cast their votes on Neil Patrick Harris\u2019s Facebook and Instagram handles to decide what tricks and treats will appear \u2014 but it is Harris himself who will be behind the scenes during the entire event, calling the shots.\n\n\u201cThis partnership for me has been an exciting opportunity to see this beta test, just to be the first person, the first team to do something of this nature,\u201d Harris explains to Yahoo Entertainment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in an adjacent room asking viewers what should happen next and then cackling and laughing at the reactions.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the actor would take on the role of Ringmaster for such a spooky scene. Harris and his husband of five years, David Burtka, have long delighted their social media followers with elaborate holiday-themed photo shoots. The couple\u2019s two children, 9-year-old twins Gideon and Harper, always accompany their famous parents in acting out the various themes.\n\n\u201cOur kids really have no choice but to get in on the spirit,\u201d Harris jokes. The actor explained that Halloween isn\u2019t just a one-day celebration in the Burtka-Harris household, but usually spans the entire month.\n\nThe family\u2019s epic list of past costumes includes circus freaks, old Hollywood icons, Star Wars characters and the Haunted Mansion ghosts. What can fans expect from this year\u2019s Halloween shoot?\n\n\u201cI am starting to get a little stressed when it all becomes comparative,\u201d admits Harris. Now that his children are older, he explains, they are more opinionated when it comes to the ideation process behind the family\u2019s joint costumes. Third-graders Gideon and Harper are more interested in \u201creading and education and less into stabbing,\u201d which explains why this year\u2019s theme is going in an \u201cartsy\u201d direction.\n\nIt\u2019s A LIVE isn\u2019t all scary, however. The invited guests who successfully maneuver Harris\u2019s tricks will be rewarded in the interactive\u2019s \u201cTreat Suite,\u201d featuring Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups. \u201cWe want to make sure it\u2019s not just frightening, so it plays to more than one demographic,\u201d Harris explains.\n\nViewers can watch and vote on what tricks and treats will befall the It\u2019s A LIVE guests on October 24 at 9pm ET on Facebook Live.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "description": "Reese\u2019s interactive Halloween experience, It\u2019s A LIVE, isn\u2019t your average haunted house \u2014 and Neil Patrick Harris is making sure of that.", "authors": ["Maggie Andrew"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bDjLbk9unNgvf7lfbC0ojg--~B/aD0zNjA7dz03MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/741bd040-f605-11e9-9fc7-1da1dc878240", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
