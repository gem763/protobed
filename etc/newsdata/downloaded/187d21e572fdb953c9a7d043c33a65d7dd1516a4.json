As a result, two current employees of smart home platform Wink \u2014 which i.am+ acquired in 2017 \u2014 tell The Verge that workers haven\u2019t been paid in seven weeks, and that their office in Schenectady, New York has been temporarily closed. Wink users have also reported on Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook that all sorts of third-party devices have stopped working with the platform, and that the company\u2019s customer support line is dead.\n\nFounded in 2012, the Black Eyed Peas frontman originally positioned i.am+ as a maker of extremely expensive iPhone cases. The company eventually expanded into other hardware, like a poorly reviewed smartwatch, and wireless earbuds that were modeled in promo photos by Kendall Jenner. The company ultimately raised over $100 million in venture capital after pivoting again to making conversational artificial intelligence for corporations. (It sold chatbot technology to Deutsche Telekom in 2017, for example.)\n\nA deal with a Dubai retailer has stalled for months\n\nBut a stalled deal with Dubai-based retail giant Majid Al Futtaim (MAF) has apparently left the company in the lurch, according to a handful of all-staff emails seen by The Verge.\n\nWill.i.am announced the deal with MAF at the beginning of 2019, which was supposed to use i.am+\u2019s contextual AI technology to create an \u201centirely new level of experiential retail.\u201d Shortly after the deal was announced, Will.i.am claimed i.am+ and MAF\u2019s combined forces could create a company as big as Amazon.\n\nAlmost nine months later, that deal is still not done. In an email sent on Friday, October 18th, i.am+ accountant Travis Lopez said MAF is \u201c100% on board\u201d and that the deal is dragging because MAF has \u201cnever undertaken a technology partnership of this size.\u201d In another email, sent this past Wednesday, i.am+ co-founder and CEO Chandrasekar Rathakrishnan said the company is \u201ccaught in [MAF\u2019s] internal process and waiting on the release of funds.\u201d Rathakrishnan said i.am+ is \u201cspeaking with [MAF] everyday and pushing it aggressively to receive funds now,\u201d and that there is \u201cno question or risk\u201d that his company will be paid.\n\nRathakrishnan also apologized to employees. \u201cI realize we are hurting badly and while it does not help soften the pain, please be assured that we are doing all we can to recover expediently,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRepresentatives for MAF did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shay Markarian, i.am+\u2019s head of HR, said in an email that the company\u2019s senior executives could not immediately respond to questions because they were all on flights to Los Angeles. (Will.i.am performed during the opening ceremony of a robotics challenge in Dubai on Thursday. He\u2019s also slated to attend the Future Investment Initiative conference next week, also known as Davos in the Desert, according to a leaked schedule obtained by Axios \u2014 one year after a number of companies and executives abandoned the conference following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.)\n\nThe MAF deal isn\u2019t the only one i.am+ has had trouble closing. In May, wireless earbud startup Earin walked away from a deal with i.am+, saying only that the acquisition \u201cstalled due to unfulfilled obligations.\u201d\n\ni.am+ owes more than $2 million in delinquent taxes, according to documents filed in California\n\nAt the same time, i.am+ is also late on both state and federal tax payments, according to documents filed with the California secretary of state. The state of California has filed multiple tax liens over the last year against i.am+ showing a total of nearly $500,000 in delinquent taxes. The federal government filed a lien in August showing i.am+ owes $1,787,726.11 in delinquent taxes and interest.\n\nI.am+ did make some short-term cash in August by selling the assets of Over.ai, an Israeli conversational AI company it had acquired in 2016, to the voice-over IP company Vonage for an undisclosed amount. Will.i.am\u2019s startup was even given \u201cconsiderable\u201d stock in Vonage as part of the deal, according to an email from the director of Wink\u2019s New York office, which was obtained by The Verge. But i.am+\u2019s cash needs were apparently so pressing that the company turned right around and sold that Vonage stock to a bank in order to meet payroll, according to the email.\n\nWink has had an especially troubled history, even for a startup. It was originally founded in 2014 as Wink Labs, inside of a startup incubator called Quirky. Just one year later, Quirky filed for bankruptcy. As part of that restructuring, Quirky announced a plan to spin off Wink as a standalone business, and ultimately sold it to electronics manufacturer Flextronics. Two years later, Flextronics sold Wink to i.am+.\n\nBut the current employees, who were granted anonymity because they are still holding out hope of being paid, say things have only gotten worse in 2019. Payments have been late basically all year, they say, but going seven weeks without a paycheck is creating serious personal financial problems. One says they\u2019ve resorted to delivering pizzas to pay overdue bills, while another says they\u2019re borrowing money for meals.\n\n\u201cJust feels like lies on top of lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust feels like lies on top of lies, that they\u2019re trying to starve us out, to quit,\u201d one says. \u201cPeople [are] leaving left and right and none of those seats are being replaced by new employees,\u201d says another.\n\nMeanwhile, Wink customers across the internet are reporting all sorts of problems, and many aren\u2019t able to get answers from the company\u2019s customer support. The platform\u2019s status page is down, and firmware updates aren\u2019t downloading. Third-party products meant to connect to Wink\u2019s smart home hubs have reportedly stopped working, including one customer\u2019s door locks, according to a post on the Wink subreddit.\n\n\u201cSpooky! Just in time for Halloween!\u201d a fellow Redditor replied.", "description": "Wink workers tell The Verge that they haven\u2019t been paid in seven weeks, and that their office in Schenectady, New York has been temporarily closed.
