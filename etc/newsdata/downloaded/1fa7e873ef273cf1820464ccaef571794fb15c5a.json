Rob Bishop, Utah Republican, affirmed that states should \u201cmaintain primacy for the regulation of hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas production on State and private lands,\u201d and that no president should impose a moratorium without congressional approval.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks, many of the Democratic candidates for president have pledged to ban hydraulic fracturing in the United States, a campaign promise straight out of the keep-it-in-the-ground playbook,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Lesko, Arizona Republican, in a floor speech.\n\nSens. Kamala Harris, Bernard Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, all 2020 Democratic presidential hopfeuls, have called for a nationwide ban on fracking, an extraction process used in the vast majority of U.S. natural gas production.\n\n\u201cAny proposal to avert the climate crisis must include a full fracking ban on public and private lands,\u201d Mr. Sanders tweeted last month.\n\nAnother dozen Democratic presidential candidates have said they support ending fossil-fuel extraction on federal lands.\n\nFLOOR ALERT: Democrats just blocked @RepDLesko\u2019s request to prevent the Administration - and any future president - from imposing a ban on hydraulic fracking. #jobs #americanenergy pic.twitter.com/etYHHEKbw3 \u2014 HouseRulesRepublicans (@RulesReps) October 29, 2019\n\nDemocrats blocked the option to consider a resolution affirming state primacy over the regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology that\u2019s enabled America\u2019s energy revolution and delivered lower energy prices for consumers in a safer, cleaner way https://t.co/Q5CkYqopSf \u2014 Natural Resources GOP (@NatResources) October 29, 2019\n\nMs. Lesko argued that fracking is already heavy regulated by states, adding that the fracking revolution has reduced energy bills and greenhouse-gas emissions as natural gas replaces coal in U.S. electricity generation.\n\n\u201cAfter the introduction of hydraulic fracturing techniques, U.S. gas bills fell by $13 billion collectively every year from 2007-13,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the while, natural gas production using fracking is driving the lowest emissions levels in a generation.\u201d\n\nSuch a moratorium would force the increasingly energy-independent United States to rely once again on foreign oil and natural gas imports, she added.\n\nFracking foes have argued that the process creates health risks for nearby communities, which the industry denies, and contributes to the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d by encouraging the use of fossil fuels instead of green energy.\n\nIn 2016, a federal judge struck down the Obama administration\u2019s fracking regulations, ruling that the states have authority over the process.\n\nKathleen Sgamma, president of Western Energy Alliance, said that even though no vote was held, the resolution served as a useful reminder to Democrats that \u201cthe president does not have the authority to ban fracking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a proactive measure to buttress the fact that there\u2019s no federal mechanism to regulate fracking,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cQuite frankly, I\u2019m not really afraid of a President Warren\u2019s executive order on fracking, because it\u2019s just such an overreach. It\u2019s so beyond presidential power that the industry would sue the next day. And we would win in court.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
