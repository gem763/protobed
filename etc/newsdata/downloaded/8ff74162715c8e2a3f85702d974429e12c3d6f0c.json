An initial report from ABC News, quoting then New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, alleged that the shooter, whose hair was dyed red, had called himself \u201cThe Joker.\u201d Then The New York Times made matters worse, reporting that, \u201cWitnesses told the police that Mr. Holmes said something to the effect of \u2018I am the Joker,\u2019 according to a federal law enforcement official, and that his hair had been dyed or he was wearing a wig.\u201d And thus, a myth was born.\n\nBut those reports turned out to be false. As the Denver Post later concluded, \u201cInvestigators heard no witness talking about the Joker\u2026And no police officer claimed [the shooter] called himself the Joker.\u201d If that weren\u2019t enough, the shooter himself confessed to a psychiatrist that he did not dye his hair red to emulate the Joker (whose hair is green, by the way), but that he did so because \u201cred suggests bravery.\u201d Because of the rampant media speculation, though, the shooter\u2019s inmates did eventually take to calling him \u201cThe Joker,\u201d to which the shooter remarked, \u201cThey kind of turned me into a supervillain.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Thedailybeast.Com The-Wildly-Irresponsible-Media-Coverage-Of-Joaquin-Phoenixs-Joker"], "top_image": ""}
