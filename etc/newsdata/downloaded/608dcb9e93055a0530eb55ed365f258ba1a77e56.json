Ever.\"\n\nHe was accompanied by other officials including Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula and Gauteng Premier David Makhura.\n\nRamaphosa said that there should be no need for families to plant crosses of remembrance and flowers along sidewalks and roadsides.\n\n\n\n\"It is through our individual sense of responsibility that all of us will arrive alive, uninjured and without any infringements, fines or judgments against our names, all of the time.\"\n\nHe said that in addition to the immense human cost of fatal accidents, the economic cost is estimated to be around R147bn every year.\n\n\"We must arrest this dire situation for the sake of preserving the health of our people and the productivity of our country,\" said Ramaphosa.\n\nREAD | Road traffic demerit system: Here\u2019s how it works and how to avoid accumulating points\n\nHe encouraged people to use public transport, but also expressed concern over persistent vandalism and commuters' vulnerability to crime on public transport.\n\n\"Public transport is not just about moving us from place to place, but it is about putting us in shared spaces where we are able to build bridges between individuals and communities.\n\n\"But where public transport fails, or does not exist, or is inadequate, the lives of our people cannot improve.\"\n\nIn addition to other projects, October will also see the launch of three more bus rapid transit systems in different municipalities across the country.\n\nThese are the Harambee Pilot Rapid service from Tembisa, Kempton Park, Isando and OR Tambo; Leeto La Polokwane in Limpopo; and the Go Durban BRT in Ethekwini.\n\n* Compiled by Jenni Evans", "description": "Drive safely, comply with traffic officials and make more use of public transport, President Cyril Ramaphosa has said at the launch of the first Transport Month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9412/59d7c23d47d04d4ab23e9f4aaaf75b00.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
