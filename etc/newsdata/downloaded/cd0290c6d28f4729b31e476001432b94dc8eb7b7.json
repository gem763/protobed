We found that not to be true, they\u2019re not easy to win.\u201d\n\nBarry added that \u201cnot only aren\u2019t they easy to win, but the unintended costs of a trade war are far more significant than most Americans ever realized. That\u2019s the wake-up call \u2014 when you start engaging in this kind of conflict, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a bottom to it.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump hasn't showed signs of backing down against China.

And 36 states exported fewer goods to China in 2018 than they did in 2017. This is likely tied to the tariffs spurned from the trade war.\n\nSome of those states include Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas \u2014 an overwhelming majority in the Midwest. Exports from Illinois to China were down 32.9% last year, the largest among any state. Its biggest exports were oilseeds and grains. Overall, Illinois\u2019 exports to China accounted for 57,570 American jobs in 2017, according to the USBC report.\n\nThese are states that rely heavily on the agricultural industry, like soybeans. At one point in 2018, U.S. soybean exports to China \u2014 the biggest consumer of the product \u2014 were down 98%. To try to offset the effect of the tariffs, the USDA created its market facilitation program to dole out payments to farmers.\n\n\u201cThe subsidies that the U.S. government is providing to farmers to make up for lost sales to China are not making up dollar for dollar for the loss,\u201d Barry said. \u201cSo, I think one point to make clear is that they do not completely make these farmers whole. There\u2019s still a difference between what the farmers could earn and did earn when there weren\u2019t tariffs on their products going into China and what the U.S. government is paying them.\u201d\n\nGoods exports are down sharply in the Midwest.

Brazil has become a popular spot to purchase soybeans \u2014 while U.S. soybean inventories continue to rise. And there\u2019s no guarantee that when the trade war comes to an end, business between the U.S. and China will go back to normal.\n\n\u201cChina is not sitting around waiting for this trade dispute to be resolved,\u201d Barry said. \u201cThose markets for a U.S. farmer could be gone permanently.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOnce the Chinese buyers have developed relationships with other suppliers, why should they come back to the U.S. if they can get what they need at a similar price or a lower price, as is the case now, because the competitors\u2019 prices are lower because they\u2019re not tariffed to the same extent that the U.S. products are tariffed?\u201d\n\nThe impact on the U.S. consumer\n\nAlthough China is only the third-largest U.S. goods export market (behind Canada and Mexico), the trade war has still had a major effect over the last year and a half.", "description": "The U.S.-China trade war has dealt heavy blows to the American economy, and President Trump has indicated that the U.S. will not back down.", "authors": ["Adriana Belmonte", "Associate Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/99FIijAxq1ocarrc8C2IGQ--~B/aD0zOTA5O3c9NTg2MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/aab77170-e392-11e9-8fd3-bdfccc762b52", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
