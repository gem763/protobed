Antonio Valladares, AP\n\nBoth moments surfaced during a week when the USA TODAY Network launched a team of nearly 30 journalists to begin a comprehensive examination of the migrant crisis along the U.S. southern border. The unprecedented effort revealed an immigration system on the brink of collapse.\n\nFor seven days, the reporting teams documented \u2013 hour by hour, scene by scene \u2013 the complex issues that have combined to create a precarious scenario for the United States and nations to the south that are grappling with undocumented migrants. The consequences and implications were clearly visible at times and dangerously hidden at others:\n\nStrained and exhausted aid groups struggling to manage shelters choked with twice as many people, or more, as they were built to house. Border Patrol agents thrust into roles they aren\u2019t trained to handle. Immigration courts overwhelmed \u2013 with seemingly no manageable caseloads in sight and no chance at swift justice. Local governments scrambling at their own expense to feed and house migrants abandoned in their cities by the U.S government, with costs swelling into the millions. And, day after day, migrants staring down death and hardship in their search for a better life.\n\nDuring the week-long effort \u2013 from June 24 to 30 \u2013 the teams reported from four countries and six U.S. states. They traveled more than 20,000 miles \u2013 including to the highlands of Guatemala, the National Palace in Mexico City, locations on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, immigration courts in Los Angeles and the lawmaking chambers of Washington, D.C. \u2013 digging deep into a crisis years in the making.\n\nPrevious U.S. presidents have grappled with waves of migrants who show up at the border. But the federal government's actions since President Donald Trump took office in 2017 \u2013 including limiting asylum requests and separating children from families \u2013 have left border officials ill-equipped to respond and have put migrants at unneeded risk, creating a scenario that serves no one well, according to local government officials, immigration lawyers, longtime border residents and immigration policy experts.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been treated as a whole-government emergency response,\u201d said Theresa Brown of the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cIt\u2019s been treated as a border security problem. That\u2019s exacerbated the problem.\u201d\n\nDestino: Estados Unidos. One week, through the eyes of the migrants USA TODAY\n\nThis year, the sheer number of migrants who arrived \u2013 especially families \u2013 overwhelmed U.S. Border Patrol facilities. In the first six months of 2019, federal agents apprehended 534,758 migrants at the southwestern border \u2013 the highest six-month tally of any year since 2008, according to Border Patrol statistics.\n\nThe administration notes that apprehensions were down in August, year over year, and points to that as a sign that the Trump presidency has slowed the flow of immigration. But the consequences of the 2019 surge will ripple through the immigration system for years, and the administration's recent move to block asylum almost entirely seems certain, experts say, to put more migrants at risk.\n\nThe week began with the death of a father and daughter. It will end with five more recorded deaths of migrants in the U.S. and untold deaths of others along the way. In that time, a young mother will become disillusioned by life in the U.S. and consider returning home. Federal authorities will release thousands of migrants, who will board buses and planes and scatter to cities across the United States. A shelter director will struggle to keep migrants in his care from being kidnapped or raped. A family in El Salvador will bury their loved ones.\n\nAnd still, each day, more migrants begin their journey north.\n\nMonday, June 24\n\n7 a.m. Escalante, Gonzalez and Adriana awake in the Yuma Border Patrol Station in Arizona, known as la hielera, or \"freezer,\" named for its frigid temperatures.\n\nThe previous morning, after slipping into the U.S., the Guatemalan family trekked under a blistering sun and were picked up by Border Patrol agents, along with 35 other migrants. The agents bused them to the Yuma Station.\n\nThe family spent the night in separate chain-link holding cells. Escalante, 35, shared a single juice bottle with 50 other men in his crowded cell. Gonzalez, 29, and Adriana shivered through the night on the floor of a different cell, forced to sleep on their sides because of the limited space and hugging for warmth as another woman\u2019s feet brushed Gonzalez's face.\n\nThere were no mattresses, and the bathroom had no soap.\n\n9:30 a.m. - Andrea Delgado, a Mexican health worker, kneels on the floor at the Alfa y Omega migrant shelter in Mexicali, Mexico, over the border from Calexico, California. She gently holds a finger of 6-year-old Maritza Salazar Lopez and leans in to prick it. \u201cIt\u2019ll be quick,\u201d Delgado promises.\n\nShow caption Hide caption MEXICALI, Mexico \u2013 Marisela Lopez, 28, holds her 6-year-old daughter, Maritza Salazar Lopez, as Andrea Delgado with the Baja California state health ministry draws blood...

Delgado was testing for malaria at the migrant shelter Casa de Ayuda Alfa y Omega. Omar Ornelas, USA TODAY Network\n\nMaritza has been vomiting and hit by recurring fevers. Health officials want to test for malaria.\n\nMaritza and her mom, Marisela Lopez, arrived at the shelter in March, when U.S. immigration officials sent them to Mexicali under the Trump administration\u2019s Migrant Protection Protocols rule. The policy, enacted last year, requires all non-Mexican migrants requesting asylum along the southwestern border to return to Mexico to await their day in immigration court, which can take months.\n\nLopez and her daughter fled Guatemala to reunite with Maritza\u2019s father in Maryland. After arriving in Mexico, both mother and daughter contracted chickenpox during an outbreak at the shelter. Lopez missed her first asylum hearing in May because, she says, U.S. officials saw blisters on her face and body and denied her access into the country. She doesn't know how to get a new court date.\n\nAt Alfa y Omega, people wash their clothes in a large sink and then hang the wet laundry from all possible corners. Some seek shade from the relentless sun. By late afternoon, the shelter manager makes a big pot of soup and offers bowls to the migrants.\n\nAfter her evaluation, Maritza is rewarded with two lollipops. That night, with triple-digit heat outside and no air-conditioning inside, Maritza and her mother squeeze together with 450 other migrants and sleep on thin mats on the ground, surrounded by their few belongings.\n\n9:52 a.m. - Judge Lori Bass\u2019s 17th-floor courtroom in Los Angeles Immigration Court is crammed to capacity. Among those seated: Yenelin Guadalupe Garc\u00eda Solval, 19, from Guatemala, who has lived in Anaheim, California, for more than two years with her mother and stepfather. She and her brother, Elvis, 14, fled an abusive father and crossed the border to live with their mother.\n\nAs of June, Garc\u00eda Solval\u2019s immigration case was one of more than 908,000 pending across the United States, according to the TRAC Immigration Project at Syracuse University in New York. That's nearly twice as many cases as were pending nationwide just three years ago.\n\nOutside the downtown courthouse, lines form as early as 6:30 a.m. Immigrants \u2013 some accompanied by lawyers, and all dressed in courtroom attire \u2013 wait patiently for the doors to open.\n\nJudge Ashley Tabaddor, head of the National Association of Immigration Judges, says she and other judges are drowning in cases. On a maroon sofa in her Los Angeles office, more than 40 thick case files \u2013 all unreviewed \u2013 tower in a neat stack. Tabaddor says the backlog at times is daunting. The federal government expects her to complete 700 cases a year.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t really account for the out-of-court time we need, which, as you can see, is a lot,\" Tabaddor says, picking up the stack of paper and dropping it back on the couch.\n\nInside Bass' courtroom, Garc\u00eda Solval tells the judge she\u2019s seeking asylum because she is a lesbian. In Guatemala, she says, that means she\u2019s harassed at school and everywhere else.\n\nBass looks over her notes, the only sounds the soft hum of a copying machine in the courtroom and the shuffling of papers. Finally, the judge leans into her microphone.\n\n\u201cYour case is being terminated because asylum has been granted,\u201d Bass says. She adds, \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\n\nA smile spreads across Garc\u00eda Solval\u2019s face.\n\n1:45 p.m. - A Honduran woman, Elsa Ondina, splashes water from a garbage can onto her 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son.

Soft-spoken, Ondina says she left Honduras to escape gang violence. Her children weren\u2019t able to go to school, and they lived in fear.\n\nSince arriving in Del Rio, baths have been a rarity.

The woman says someone in Mexico tried to stop them. Unsure whether they were Mexican military or drug gangs, she and her children ran across the Rio Grande into the U.S. The river was shallow with tall brush.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, you\u2019re in the U.S. now,\u201d Escalante tells her in Spanish.\n\nEscalante grew up in El Paso when the river was wider and there were no fences.

Many migrants use the money to flee north.\n\nTAPACHULA, Mexico \u2013 Central American migrant families live in the Jesus the Good Shepard Shelter for Migrants while they wait for a transit visa to go north toward the United States.

A private bank, Caja de Cr\u00e9dito, charges them 42% interest on another $2,000 in loans, according to the couple.\n\nThe couple, along with their three children, crossed into the U.S. in June, spent five days detained in El Paso, and then were sent back to Juarez under the Migrant Protection Protocols while waiting a hearing on their asylum claim.\n\nThe couple\u2019s first hearing is scheduled for December \u2013 six months away.\n\nPaname\u00f1o says organized crime has taken over nearly every corner of life in their hometown, including the right to wash clothes in a nearby river. But waiting in Mexico seems even riskier. She and her husband are considering returning to El Salvador, despite the consequences.\n\n\u201cWe were doomed there,\u201d she says. \u201cWe came here for a better life.\u201d\n\nTuesday, June 25\n\n8 a.m. - In McAllen, Texas, Mayor Jim Darling checks his email for updates from the Border Patrol and nonprofit groups about the crush of migrants arriving in his city.\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley has absorbed most of the recent surge of undocumented migrants: There were 43,205 apprehensions here in June, more than double that of any other sector along the border, according to Border Patrol statistics. The city has set up barricades on the international bridge to stem the flow of migrants crossing into McAllen, narrowing the four lanes to one and slowing commerce to a crawl.\n\nShow caption Hide caption MCALLEN, Texas \u2013 An unaccompanied minor from Guatemala is detained by border patrol along the Rio Grande Valley Sector on June 25, 2019.

The minor traveled with a group but became lost once they crossed into the United States illegally. Sandy Hooper, USA TODAY Network\n\nThe city lost around $100,000 in toll revenue from the lane closures. Businesses, many of which rely on goods and customers from Mexico, saw sales drop.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting the Mexican government to control the southern border, but we can\u2019t even control one lane on a bridge,\u201d says Darling, who doesn't identify as Democrat or Republican.\n\nDarling isn't new to migration-related dilemmas. In 2014, his city spent more than $600,000 providing tents and transport and retrofitting showers for Catholic Charities, a local group that deals with migrants, as waves of unaccompanied minors arrived at the border. He sought reimbursement from the federal government but said he's only received $175,000.\n\nSome U.S. cities have drawn controversy for becoming so-called sanctuary cities, prohibiting local police from asking about immigration status or cooperating with federal agents. A Texas law says it is illegal for cities to refuse cooperation with federal immigration officials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a lot of criticism for being a sanctuary city and we say, \u2018We're not a sanctuary city and you ought to be grateful for what's happening here,\u2019 \u201d Darling says.\n\n8:18 a.m. - At his daily news conference in the north wing of the National Palace, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador says he will deploy 15,000 active-duty soldiers and federal police to Mexico\u2019s northern border.\n\nQuestions about Mexico\u2019s immigration enforcement policies have become a fixture of these early morning news conferences, ever since the government reached a deal with the Trump administration to curb the number of migrants reaching their shared border.\n\nShow caption Hide caption TAPACHULA, Mexico \u2013 A member of Mexico\u2019s National Guard stands watch as a Mexican immigration officer boards a bus headed north on the Pacific Coast...

Show Hide Historically, most people who crossed the border illegally were adult men from Mexico, who hoped to evade Border Patrol and seek work in the U.S. Today, the picture is far different. Many migrants are adults with children, or unaccompanied children, especially from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, three countries in Central America with high rates of poverty and violence. The Trump administration has sought to stem this flow in a variety of ways: by making it harder for these families to seek and win asylum cases, and by pressuring Mexico to stop Central Americans from passing through. Some experts say Trump's enforcement policies send the message that the door may soon close, giving smuggling organizations the perfect advertising campaign. The result in 2019 may have been more migrants hurrying to cross the U.S.-Mexico before losing their chance. READ MORE: Who are the migrants, where are they coming from?

Show Hide Many border-crossers have surrendered to Border Patrol agents in hopes of making an asylum claim. Many of these migrants are parents with children. Once they\u2019re in custody, they enter the pipeline of a system that often struggles to house, move and provide for them. First, they\u2019re typically taken to a processing center near the U.S.-Mexico border for background checks. After this, some migrants have been released in a matter of hours. Some have waited months. They are released or transferred based on whether they are part of a family unit, an unaccompanied child, or a single adult. If they\u2019re released, they typically join family members already living in the U.S. They are expected to return to immigration court for a hearing, but wait times for those hearings average more than 700 days. While in the U.S., they may be able to get a work permit, but this, too requires a long wait.

It\u2019s the ninth body discovered in a canal near El Paso since early June.\n\nThe El Paso County Sheriff\u2019s Office later identifies the woman as 19-year-old Natividad Quinto Crisostomo of Paracho, Mexico, about 1,000 miles south.\n\nIn all, Border Patrol recorded five migrant deaths during the week of June 24-30 along the entire southwestern border. They include: A body found in the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass; a man who fell off a border fence near Nogales, Arizona; and a 43-year-old Salvadoran man who died while in custody. The federal agency doesn\u2019t count bodies found by local law enforcement, a number that immigrant advocates say is much higher.\n\nOther recent deaths, in addition to \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez and his daughter Valeria, include three men found June 10 in a water tunnel near the border fence in El Paso and the bodies of a preschool-age girl and a man wearing a life jacket found in a canal the following day.\n\nMigrants often swim across canals to reach the U.S. Some of the canals run parallel near the Rio Grande. Canal depths can reach 10 feet, with fast-moving water. The drownings picked up after water from local dams was released into the Rio Grande for the summer irrigation season.\n\n9:17 a.m. - U.S. Border Patrol Agent Marcelino Medina stops his white Chevy Tahoe along a dirt road near Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park in Mission, Texas.

Roughly 1,000 more cross over from Mexico each day. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Medina says.\n\nLater, he encounters another group of 23 migrants along a path near the Rio Grande. Their clothes are splotched with fresh mud, their eyes weary. Most of them are women and small children. One woman is nine months pregnant, her due date four days away.\n\n\u201cAre you OK?\u201d he asks them in Spanish. \u201cDo you need water?\u201d He turns to the pregnant woman: \u201cDo you need help?\u201d The woman, rubbing her belly, says she\u2019s tired but fine.\n\nAs he\u2019s processing them, another 13 migrants emerge from the brush, followed a few moments later by six more.

Or if the U.S. provided foreign aid to stabilize the government in El Salvador. Or if U.S. ports were adequately staffed with asylum judges to hear the cases. \u201cThat is what is at stake,\u201d he says.\n\nA few hours later, Trump, on his way to an economic forum in Japan, is asked about the photo. \u201cI hate it,\u201d he says flatly.\n\nHe blames Democrats for not doing more to change immigration laws. \u201cAnd then that father, who probably was this wonderful guy with his daughter, things like that wouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d Trump says.\n\n1:03 p.m. - In Tapachula, Yulisa Almendarez, 26, makes tortillas by a wood fire as her son, 12-year-old Jose, kicks a soccer ball nearby with other children.

When they reached Mexico City, he and two other men pooled their money to buy bus tickets to Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, Texas. They went straight to an international bridge. There, a Mexican immigration official told them they would have to wait up to a year to see a U.S. official.\n\nAfter four days, they returned to Mexico City.\n\nNow, he works to earn enough money to get his mother here. Today, he made about $3 from juggling.\n\n3 p.m. - Border Patrol officials lead a group of journalists through their temporary processing center in Clint, Texas. Earlier in the month, a team of lawyers went to the immigration facility and described appalling conditions, including kids with vomit on their shirts and adults sleeping on concrete floors. The lawyers spoke with detainees who also reported spending 18 days locked up without seeing daylight, wearing the same clothes for days or weeks and having no access to a toothbrush or basic hygiene. Outbreaks of flu, scabies and chickenpox were common.\n\nThe station holds migrant children ranging from months-old infants to teen mothers.\n\nOn the media trip, children sit on the floor or on benches in a jail cell, closed off to the rest of the facility by heavy metal doors and windows.

The U.S. has struggled in both instances to house and care for them. A sudden influx of children in 2014 set off a crisis. Lacking enough beds in government contracted migrant shelters, the Obama administration resorted instead to holding unaccompanied minors for extended periods of time in Border Patrol stations, and then in large-scale detention facilities. The new wave, in 2018 and 2019, saw many children separated from their parents under a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy. Conditions in detention facilities for families were criticized by blistering reports from government watchdog groups. An Inspector General report released in September found migrant children separated from their parents by the Trump administration suffered mental trauma, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The experiences of minors from the first surge in 2014 led to long-term health problems for some \u2013 a condition that may repeat itself in the coming years for the latest group of migrant children.

His pleas for urgent action included a March news conference at the border, where he said the situation had reached a breaking point with 14,000 migrants in custody, followed by another news conference in May as the number of detainees neared 20,000.\n\n\u201cAll of this received relatively limited attention and little action until this past week on the Hill,\u201d McAleenan says.\n\n12:25 p.m. - Delmy L\u00f3pez is in a Greyhound bus speeding west toward California. Her 2-year-old daughter, Perla, is next to her.\n\nPHOENIX \u2013 Delmy L\u00f3pez, 31, a migrant from Honduras, sends a message on her phone while on a bus at the Phoenix Greyhound station on June 29, 2019. Courtney Sacco, USA TODAY Network\n\nL\u00f3pez\u2019s back and hips still ache from carrying Perla across the churning Rio Grande the week before. She remembers the rawness on her scalp as Perla tugged her hair to keep from falling off her shoulders. When she closes her eyes, she still sees what she believes were alligators slipping their heavy bodies in and out of the water, and hears the clicking of their mouths.\n\nShe thumbs through Facebook on her phone and comes across a post about \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez and his daughter, Valeria, the Salvadorans who died crossing the same river. This is not the tragic photo of the soaked, drowned bodies that was shared widely. This is a selfie, taken earlier. Father and daughter are smiling, seemingly full of joy and hope.\n\nQuestions gnaw at L\u00f3pez: What if Martinez had carried Valeria on his shoulders, like she carried Perla, instead of inside his shirt? Did he stomp across the river instead of slide his feet? Why did God let her pass but take this family?\n\nShe stares a moment longer at the social media post, then presses \u201clike,\u201d attaching a tiny red heart to the image.\n\n2:20 p.m. - Ruben Garcia sits at a long table, scrolling through the afternoon text messages.\n\n\u201cSir, I have 2 pregnant females for non-detained appointments requesting placement,\u201d reads one from a Border Patrol agent.\n\n\u201cGood morning, we have 80 for transport this morning, with up to 3 shuttle bus runs today,\u201d another says.\n\nAnother one, from an ICE contact: \u201c64 individuals. 1 Brazilian. Please advise.\u201d\n\nAs director of Annunciation House in El Paso, a faith-based migrant shelter, Garcia has housed more than 100,000 migrants the past eight months \u2013 the most the 40-year-old nonprofit has ever seen.\n\nGarcia recruited faith-based organizations in El Paso, New Mexico and Denver to help manage the overflow of migrants. In the spring, as the crisis intensified, he converted a former Costco warehouse into an emergency shelter, keeping the migrant crisis off the streets of El Paso.\n\nAs such, the city feels the migration crisis only when there is a sudden change, like each time the Trump administration redirects Customs and Border Protection officers from El Paso crossings to other points along the border, causing long delays at the international bridges.\n\n\u201cI think El Paso is very welcoming,\u201d Garcia says. \u201cAnnunciation House took on the responsibility for all these refugees that otherwise would have fallen on the city.\u201d\n\nSaturday, June 29\n\n2:56 a.m. - Having approved $4.6 billion in humanitarian aid for the border just the day before, Trump takes time from the G-20 Summit in Osaka to once again address the deaths of \u00d3scar and Valeria Mart\u00ednez. Trump argues that his proposed wall and tighter border security would have kept them alive.\n\n\u201cIf they thought it was hard to get in, they wouldn\u2019t be coming up,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many lives would be saved.\u201d\n\n7:07 a.m. Tomas Gomez, of San Antonio, Guatemala, says he\u2019s not a coyote, or smuggler. But he knows a lot about the business.\n\nHis hometown is a transit city for many migrants moving north. Each coyote has his own route and charges are based on the route\u2019s degree of difficulty, Gomez says. Cheaper trips cost about $7,800 for adults. Children are an extra $3,200 each. The travel could take 10 days or longer.\n\nFor $11,000, migrants get food, lodging and transport by car all the way to the U.S. border. The fee includes the cost of bribing Mexican immigration authorities along the way, he says.\n\nShow caption Hide caption SAN MARCOS, Guatemala \u2013 Tomas Gomez Chilel, 50, says President Donald Trump is wrong to blame coyotes for the wave of migrant families arriving at... SAN MARCOS, Guatemala \u2013 Tomas Gomez Chilel, 50, says President Donald Trump is wrong to blame coyotes for the wave of migrant families arriving at the border. Migrants ask coyotes for help because they are desperate to flee extreme poverty and violence, he said. Nick Oza, USA TODAY Network\n\nTrump has blamed smuggling organizations for the surge in migrant families arriving at the U.S. border, saying smugglers are capitalizing on migrants\u2019 fears and exploiting them.\n\n\u201cPeople like to blame the guides, but the guides don\u2019t go looking for people,\u201d Gomez, 50, says. \u201cIt\u2019s the people who are looking for guides.\u201d\n\nAs Gomez speaks, his wife, dressed in a brightly colored dress worn by indigenous Mayan women, walks into the room. She carries a tray with coffee and a basket of sweet rolls wrapped in a hand-woven napkin.\n\n8 a.m. - Maria Barrera walks into the General Abelardo L. Rodriguez International Airport in Tijuana with her son, Esvin Barrera, 16.\n\nThey carry one bag between them, filled with donated clothes they received at a migrant shelter in Tijuana. Barrera and her son traveled from Guatemala to the U.S. earlier this year in search of a better life. They entered the U.S. without authorization in Texas, spent more than a week in Border Patrol processing facilities in Texas and California, and then were sent to Tijuana under the Migrant Protection Protocols until their December court date.\n\nBut Barrera says she doesn\u2019t want to wait indefinitely at a Tijuana shelter just for a judge to give them bad news. She says they were not fleeing death threats or persecution back home.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re never going to give me papers,\u201d she says, resigned to returning home to Guatemala. \u201cIt\u2019s better if I leave.\u201d\n\n10:30 a.m. - Two-year-old Adriana holds her father's hand as they walk with her mom to a park.\n\nThey find a shady park near their new home in Long Branch, New Jersey. Adriana scrambles up a slide. On a nearby basketball court, players run through drills.\n\nLONG BRANCH, N.J. \u2013 Jaime Escalante Galvez, 35, Leydi Gonzalez, 29, and their daughter, Adriana Escalante Gonzalez, 2, walk to a park on June 29, 2019. Sean Logan, USA TODAY Network\n\nJust a few months ago, Jaime Escalante Galvez would wake each day in his home province of Jalapa, Guatemala, uncertain whether he would make it home alive. Guatemala\u2019s homicide rate is 26 per 100,000 people \u2013 five times the rate in the U.S. and nearly three times that of Afghanistan, Peru and the Philippines, according to U.N. figures.\n\nThat was before he and his family decided to leave; before they squeezed under the border fence, arrived at a holding facility, then made their way to a church, then an airliner, then here, to a new life.\n\n\u201cI left my country. I left my belongings, my clothes. I came to the United States without anything,\u201d Escalante says. \u201cI was thinking about getting ahead. We migrated for a better life.\u201d\n\nHe plays awhile longer with Adriana. Then, the family walks back home, where they are staying with relatives, stopping at a mini-mart on the way to pick up chicken drumsticks and rice for dinner.\n\n1:39 p.m. - Henry Uma\u00f1a struts down Mexico City\u2019s expansive Paseo de la Reforma surrounded by rainbow-colored floats and flags during a gay pride parade. Crowds of people look on and cheer.\n\nFor Uma\u00f1a, 33, it\u2019s like walking through a dream. In his native Honduras, he lived in constant fear. Many of his friends were beaten for being gay. One of his partners was killed.\n\nSince he emigrated two years ago, Mexico City had accepted him in ways he never imagined. Last year, he enrolled in a program that teaches software development to migrants. He now works with a tech startup in Mexico City making cellphones.\n\nUma\u00f1a doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to stay in Mexico. He applied for asylum in Mexico as soon as he arrived two years ago, but the country\u2019s refugee office has denied his application twice.\n\n\u201cI jokingly told them, \u2018So do I have to show up with open bullet wounds?\u2019 They told me, \u2018Yes, to have a better case, you need to have had something really bad happen to you,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cI told them, I\u2019d rather try it now and stay alive then wait to get killed.\u201d\n\n2:21 p.m. - Yenelin Guadalupe Garc\u00eda Solval sits in the shade of an apartment building in Anaheim, California, and sketches a portrait of her friend on her phone screen.\n\nGarc\u00eda Solval, 19, was recently granted asylum after a judge decided her persecution for being a lesbian in Guatemala warranted it. Her younger brother, Elvis, however, is still at risk of being deported. Attorneys for Elvis, 14, are filing a new case to try to get him asylum based on his age. If he gets returned to Guatemala, there\u2019s nowhere there he could go \u2013 most of his family has left the country, Garc\u00eda Solval says. Also, Elvis is at an age where street gangs there will likely try to recruit him.\n\nConcerns for her brother aside, Garc\u00eda Solval is optimistic for her life in the U.S. She\u2019s captivated by detective TV shows. Upon graduating from Katella High School in Anaheim, she plans to study criminology in college and, someday, become a police detective.\n\n\u201cI feel like this is my real life. I belong here,\u201d she says.\n\n5:33 p.m. - After a harrowing journey from Honduras, Delmy L\u00f3pez pulls into the San Diego bus station with her 2-year-old daughter, Perla.\n\nShow caption Hide caption SAN DIEGO \u2013 Delmy L\u00f3pez, 31, a migrant from Honduras, messages her brother in-law as she holds her 2-year-old daughter, Perla, at a Greyhound station...

EL PASO, Texas \u2013 Elsa Arrambide, co-owner of Sunrise Wigs in downtown El Paso, opens her shop Sunday morning on a popular shopping street for border crossers. Arrambide says business is way down as long lines have become the norm on the Paso del Norte International Bridge only a few block south. Mark Lambie, USA TODAY Network\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s decision to pull U.S. customs officers from their posts at ports of entry in El Paso has drastically affected wait times to cross into the city. Multiple vehicle lanes on the international bridges now read \"cerrado\" \u2013 closed \u2013 at all hours in glowing red letters; inside the port customs buildings, many of the barstool seats where CBP officers welcome pedestrian crossers sit empty.\n\nAramvide and her mother, Raquel \u00c1ngeles, say many of their customers have all but given up trying to cross the international bridge that for decades has delivered Mexican shoppers to the El Paso street vendors who cater to them.\n\n\u201cOur sales are 40% of what they were a year ago,\u201d \u00c1ngeles said. \u201cThis street is deserted! It looks like an abandoned city. It makes us so sad.\u201d\n\n10 a.m. - A woman passes out programs for Sunday service at El Redentor, a mostly Guatemalan Methodist church in Memphis. Printed inside each program: the jarring photo of \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez and Valeria, the drowned Salvadoran father and daughter.\n\n\u201cWe pray for the fathers and mothers, sons and daughters who are coming, risking their lives in search of a better life,\u201d the accompanying text reads.\n\nPastor Luz Campos, who was born in Peru, tells the 40 or so congregants not to forget their roots and to help recently arrived migrants. Some Memphis migrants, she says, are so afraid of immigration officials they won\u2019t leave their homes. One woman is five months pregnant and won\u2019t go to the hospital.\n\nThis is your new ministry, she tells those gathered: Outreach to these shut-ins.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re brave!\u201d she shouts. \u201cHow many say, \u2018Amen?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cAmen!\u201d the audience responds.\n\n10:10 a.m. - In Mexico City, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador stands on the bed of a white pickup truck emblazoned with the insignia of the newly minted National Guard.\n\nFlanked by his top military and police commanders, the president, known by his initials AMLO, rides past rows of hundreds of men and women standing guard at the large grassy field. An enormous Mexican flag casts a long shadow among them.\n\nSince June, guard members have become the country\u2019s de facto border patrol.\n\n\u201cWe have to act, with the moderate use of force but respecting human rights,\u201d the president tells them.\n\nAround 3 miles away, hundreds of men and women march on Paseo de la Reforma and demand the president\u2019s resignation. Since taking office last year, L\u00f3pez Obrador has been criticized for being overly sympathetic with migrants.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s giving financial help to people that are not from our country, when there\u2019s so much need in Mexico,\u201d says protester Olivia Quintero Bernal, voicing one of the key grievances against the president.\n\n1:30 p.m. - It\u2019s bright and warm in San Diego, and Delmy L\u00f3pez plays with her 2-year-old daughter, Perla, at a playground in Balboa Park.

And a woman who was going to rent her an apartment suddenly withdrew the offer. No explanation given.\n\nAldana can\u2019t afford to bring them into his house, so L\u00f3pez is running out of options. She says she may try to find something in San Antonio, Texas, after an initial immigration hearing. If she can\u2019t find a shelter there or in San Diego, she may have to return to Honduras.\n\n\u201cIt seems,\u201d she says, \u201cmy dream is about to end.\u201d\n\nShow caption Hide caption TAPACHULA, Mexico \u2013 Waldina Bonilla Rodriguez, from Honduras, tried not to lose sight of her 8-year-old son, Oscar, as he weaved in and out of... TAPACHULA, Mexico \u2013 Waldina Bonilla Rodriguez, from Honduras, tried not to lose sight of her 8-year-old son, Oscar, as he weaved in and out of the crowds in his bare feet begging for money. She held a plastic cup while her 2-year-old daughter, Devlin Nicol, tugged at her tank top. The girl cried for attention, her blond hair matted in knots. Nick Oza, USA TODAY Network\n\n5:02 p.m. - Waldina Bonilla Rodriguez, 32, keeps an eye on her 8-year-old son, Oscar, as he weaves through the crowds in central Tapachula, Mexico. He\u2019s barefoot and begging for money.\n\nRodriguez holds out a small plastic cup while her 2-year-old daughter, Delin Nicol, tugs at her tank top. Every few minutes, she rattles the few coins in her cup, hoping for a few more.\n\nRodriguez arrived here in mid-April after fleeing her home in Honduras. The family spent the first two weeks sleeping on the ground in a park in the center of the city. For the past two months, they\u2019ve been living in a hostel with other migrants.\n\nGangs in her home state of Yoro, Honduras, demanded a weekly \u201ctax,\u201d pushing her deeper into poverty. Then, her oldest son, 9 at the time, was raped by a relative, Rodriquez says. She turned the man in to police. She pulls up a news article on her cellphone that she says proves her story. The relative spent time in jail but was released, she says. Rodriguez now fears for her life.\n\nShe has applied for asylum in Mexico but says it\u2019s unsafe for them here, too. Her goal is to reach the U.S., where she hears migrants fleeing violence are welcome.\n\n\u201cI have suffered a lot of abuse in Honduras,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want my kids to suffer the same.\u201d\n\nThe journey ends: The funeral of \u00d3scar and Valeria\n\nDark-dressed men, women and children stream into the Municipal Funeral Home at La Bermeja cemetery in San Salvador. Inside are caskets containing the bodies of \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez and his daughter, Valeria.\n\nThey left El Salvador in April, along with Martinez\u2019s wife, Tania Vanessa \u00c1valos. Martinez dreamed of finding work and buying a house where Valeria could grow up.\n\nThe funeral draws more than 200 people, including friends, family and church members. The mayor of San Salvador and president of El Salvador send flowers.\n\nThe next morning, two caskets are lowered into the ground at La Bermeja. The family ceremony is private, so the throngs of reporters and rows of TV cameras wait just outside the gates, where the white arch of the cemetery wall reaches upward into an almost cloudless sky.\n\nThe funeral makes international headlines.\n\nMore than 2,000 miles away, along the U.S.-Mexico border, other stories and deaths unfold without notice.\n\nThe team behind this investigation REPORTING AND ANALYSIS: This story was written by Rick Jervis.
