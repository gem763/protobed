(AP) - The arrival of Anthony \u201cAnt Man\u201d Edwards has created a buzz at Georgia.\n\nEdwards, perhaps Georgia\u2019s most celebrated signee since Dominique Wilkins in 1979, was rated as one of the nation\u2019s top two prospects by most recruiting services. He is expected to make an immediate impact in the Bulldogs\u2019 second season under coach Tom Crean.\n\n\u201cAnt Man\u201d is a big reason Georgia\u2019s season tickets, capped at 5,750 for the 10,523-seat Stegman Coliseum, sold out before the season for the first time in the program\u2019s history.\n\nEdwards, a 6-foot-5 guard from Atlanta, became the first Georgia freshman to be voted to the media\u2019s preseason All-Southeastern Conference first team. The less encouraging news from the SEC\u2019s media days was the prediction Georgia will finish ninth in the league.\n\nClearly, there are lingering doubts about a Georgia team which lost its best player, forward Nicolas Claxton, from a team which finished 11-21 overall and 2-16 in the SEC.\n\nEdwards could follow Claxton to the NBA after only one season, so the talented freshman\u2019s window to help the Bulldogs become relevant may be small.\n\nCrean has only five returning players, including junior forward Rayshaun Hammonds and senior guard Tyree Crump, on his revamped roster.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to find what our identity is going to be,\u201d Crean said, adding he wants his players to be versatile and able to play different spots on the court.\n\n\u201cThe majority of our time has been playing a lot of position-less basketball, so that they get comfortable on the floor,\u201d he said.\n\nCrean is listing all his players as playing a \u201cB\u201d position, as in basketball players, instead of forwards, guards and centers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s new to me, and that\u2019s what they are,\u201d Crean said. \u201cIt\u2019s not valid to call them centers and power forwards and things like that as much with the way that we\u2019re trying to play. They\u2019re being trained as basketball players, every day.\u201d\n\nEdwards led Georgia with 18 points in Georgia\u2019s exhibition win over Valdosta State on Friday night.\n\n\u201cI was trying to get my feel for the game,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to do me, so I just started playing my game.\u201d\n\nEdwards, freshman Toumani Camara and Northeastern graduate transfer Donnell Gresham Jr . were new names in the starting lineup. Crean said the starters could change.\n\nSome other things to know about Georgia heading into the season:\n\nLITTLE BROTHER\n\nCrump says Edwards is his \u201clittle brother\u201d on the team. \u201cAs soon as he walked through the door I knew we would click right away,\u201d Crump said. \u201cI could just tell. He had a swag about him. You got a guy that got swag about him. He is confident. This is my type of guy.\u201d\n\nHAMMONDS HEALTHY\n\nThe 6-foot-9 Hammonds is Georgia\u2019s leading returning scorer. He averaged 12.1 points while scoring in double figures in 20 of 27 games before suffering a season-ending foot injury. The junior is healthy to start the season.\n\n\u201cHe should be a hard matchup,\u201d Crean said. \u201cHe should be a very hard matchup, no matter where we play. That\u2019s what he\u2019s got to do, but he\u2019s got to get much more physical around the basket.\u201d\n\nNAME TO WATCH\n\nAnother freshman to watch is 5-foot-10 Sahvir Wheeler, who had eight points and a team-leading eight rebounds in the exhibition opener. Wheeler, from Houston, was a four-star recruit. \u201cI thought Sahvir Wheeler came in and changed the dynamic of the game,\u201d Crean said.\n\nYOUNG ROSTER\n\nThere are nine freshmen, including seven on scholarship, on the roster. Crump and guard Jordan Harris are the only seniors, while Gresham also is in his final year of eligibility as a graduate transfer.\n\nSCHEDULE HIGHLIGHTS\n\nGeorgia opens its season at home against Western Carolina on Nov. 5. It will be the first matchup between the teams since the Bulldogs\u2019 65-63 win on Dec. 21, 2013. Georgia leads the series 6-0.\n\nThe Bulldogs open with four straight home games, including a visit from Georgia Tech on Nov. 20. Georgia then opens its Maui Invitational schedule by playing Dayton on Nov. 25, followed by a game by either Michigan State or Virginia Tech. Other nonconference highlights include games at Arizona State on Dec. 14 and at Memphis on Jan. 4.\n\nGeorgia opens its SEC schedule at home against Kentucky on Jan. 7.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The arrival of Anthony \"Ant Man\" Edwards has created a buzz at Georgia.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Charles Odum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/valdosta_st_georgia_basketball_73471_c0-133-3200-1999_s1200x700.jpg?403e035e6e3671acaacd99ece533e18d3b5d91ee", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
