It also eliminates some rules making it harder for inmates to receive meals that accommodate religious needs.\n\nA Department of Corrections spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nEarlier this year, a coalition of Muslim groups complained to prison officials about a lack of food and water for inmates observing Ramadan.", "description": "Virginia prisons are relaxing some of their restrictions on group worship activities and providing religiously compliant meals to inmates following a federal investigation.
