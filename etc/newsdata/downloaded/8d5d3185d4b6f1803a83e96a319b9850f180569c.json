The purchases will last at least into the second quarter of next year.\n\nThe Fed said the T-bill purchases will keep the level of reserve balances held at the Fed \u201cat or above the level that prevailed in early September.\u201d\n\nThe Fed statement said that the actions \u201care purely technical measures\u201d and \u201cdo not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.\u201d\n\nSome economists have argued that the purchases are a soft form of quantitative easing, known as QE, that was put in place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. During the crisis, the Fed bought trillions of dollars in assets in an effort to push down long-term bond rates.\n\nBy limiting the purchases to T-bills, the Fed hopes to avoid any comparison to the crisis-era QE.\n\n\u201cPurchases of Treasury bills likely will have little if any impact on the level of longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions. As a result, these purchases should not have any meaningful effects on household and business spending decisions and the overall level of economic activity,\u201d the Fed statement said.\n\nRead: Powell says planned bond buying isn\u2019t emergency stimulus; investors are skeptical\n\nUnder the details of the plan, longer-term repo operations will be conducted twice per week, initially in an offering amount of at least $35 billion. Overnight repo operations will be conducted daily, in an offering amount of at least $75 billion per operations.\n\nShorter-term yields fell after the Fed\u2019s announcement. The rate for the 3-month bill TMUBMUSD03M, +0.00% fell 1.1 basis points to 1.676%, while the 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% rose 8.3 basis points to 1.739%.", "description": "The Federal Reserve announced Friday it will buy Treasury bills to maintain ample reserves in the banking system.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HL119_john_w_ZG_20190610121320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
