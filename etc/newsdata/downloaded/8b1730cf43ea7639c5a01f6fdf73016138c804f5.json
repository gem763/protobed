His administration released a TELCON (a summary of aides' notes) of his phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, although that seems to show that he asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for him using mafia-like insinuations. He called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to ask if they couldn't \"figure something out\" about the whistleblower complaint. And Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, is on Fox News defending Trump by having one meltdown after another.\n\nIn an effort to do a little bit of damage control, the White House has tried to coordinate its messaging with Republicans\u2014that hasn't gone so well, either. Florida representative Matt Gaetz reportedly told NBC News that Trump called Republican members of Congress to the White House on Wednesday morning to make sure that they all had the same talking points ready for the release of the call record with Zelensky. And according to Andrew Desiderio at Politico, the White House appears to have mistakenly emailed talking points to congressional Democrats. Desiderio also reports that his source claimed the White House sent a follow-up email hoping to \"recall\" the text it sent.\n\nOne point read, \"Let\u2019s be clear, there was no quid pro quo for Ukraine to get US aid in exchange for looking into Biden and his son.\" South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who long ago morphed from Trump critic to diehard sycophant, tweeted this morning, \"Wow. Impeachment over this? What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger.\"\n\nAnother bullet point stresses, \"The President mentioned Rudy Giuliani only after Zelenskyy mentioned him first and referred to Biden in only one exchange.\" The poor wording on this may have tripped up House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, who claimed to reporters that Zelensky brought up the Bidens first, despite the fact that the text clearly shows it was Trump who did. Or perhaps McCarthy simply didn't know what he was talking about.\n\nIf the Trump administration remains this committed to doing Democrats' work for them, it's likely this impeachment inquiry won't last very long.\n\nThe Harrowing Hours and Defiant Aftermath of the New Zealand Mosque Shootings\n\nOn March 15, when a white supremacist livestreamed his mass shootings of a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, a country with one of the world's lowest gun homicide rates was stunned to silence. But only momentarily. The deaths of 51 New Zealanders, mostly Muslim immigrants, would not be met with a tepid countermeasure but a swift, clear response. Sean Flynn reports from Christchurch about the day of the massacre\u2014and the days that followed.\n\nOriginally Appeared on GQ\n\n", "description": "It's been a rough 24 hours for Trump.", "authors": ["Luke Darby"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VuYtLipyIxGuu9cevqGgfw--~B/aD0zMjQxO3c9NDg2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gq_402/e976a63473818bb204347083b1d6a3b8", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
