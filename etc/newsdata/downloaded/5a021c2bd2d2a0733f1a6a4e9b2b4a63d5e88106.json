Milwaukee, which won its fifth in a row, began the day two games behind the Chicago Cubs for the second NL wild-card spot.\n\nYelich fouled a ball off his leg in the first inning. He was down on the ground for several minutes before limping off the field.\n\nHere\u2019s the foul ball that knocks Christian Yelich out for the rest of the season. Brewers say he has a fractured kneecap.

The outfielder was leading the majors in slugging percentage and OPS when he was hurt.\n\n\"We feel awful for Christian,\" manager Craig Counsell said. \"That's the thing that resonates with me right now. He's a special player and it's a joy to watch him play every day. He's the best at what he does. Not being able to see that every day is not good.\"\n\nThe team learned the severity of his injury by the middle of the game.\n\n\"I went out there and his whole body was shaking,\" Counsell said. \"I was concerned and when he got up and went down the stairs I was optimistic. Then we got the bad news.\"\n\nTrent Grisham continued Yelich's at-bat with a 1-2 count and struck out \u2014 the strikeout was charged to Yelich.\n\n\"Obviously awful, we all know Yeli and what kind of guy he is,\" said Marlins manager Don Mattingly, who had Yelich in his final two seasons in Miami before his trade to Milwaukee.\n\n\"You hate to see a player like that get hurt down the stretch. He's stepped into the superstar realm as a player, and MVP last year. You don't want to see that happen to a team down the stretch,\" he said.", "description": "Milwaukee Brewers star Christian Yelich has broken his kneecap on a foul ball and will miss the rest of the season.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5278711.1568171383!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1173691764.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
