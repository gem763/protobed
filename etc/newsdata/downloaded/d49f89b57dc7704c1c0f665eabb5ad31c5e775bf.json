He wouldn\u2019t be wrong; I\u2019m not immune to scams, and it was my first night out in Tel Aviv. To my delight, he wasn\u2019t trying to rack up my bill \u2014 he was just giving me a chaser (not the kind you throw back after taking a shot of strong alcohol).\n\n\u201cChasers are mini shots [of alcohol] that people drink throughout the night to accompany their, well \u2014 drinking,\u201d says Yuval Soffer, brand ambassador of Milk & Honey, Israel\u2019s first whiskey distillery. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised when bartenders buy you a round of chasers on the house. It\u2019s part of the Tel Aviv hospitality culture.\u201d\n\nIf you drink, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to get through a meal in Tel Aviv without taking a chaser or five of something strong like arak, a Levantine spirit made from grapes and aniseed. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re sitting alone at the bar or in the thick of a 10-person business meeting at a restaurant \u2014 you\u2019ll probably have a bartender appear with micro doses of local booze.\n\nWhile traveling, sampling the local moonshine can be a door to gaining a deeper understanding of the local culture. It can lead to priceless experiences, like the time I let a group of women pour alcohol from an unmarked jug straight into my mouth at 2 a.m. in the thick of a parade in the streets of Oaxaca, Mexico. But how does a traveler cautiously gauge when to dive in and when to stay away?\n\n[Deadly brew: At least 76 people die in India after drinking bootleg liquor]\n\nEvery year, headlines remind us that there are dangerous alcohols out there. As The Washington Post has reported: \u201cDeaths from illicit liquor are common in India, where illegally manufactured alcohol is often consumed for reasons including poverty and geographic isolation. Bootleggers have been known to add methanol, a toxic substance used in antifreeze, to such brews; it can also be present because of a mistake in the distilling process.\u201d\n\nAnd yet the allure of drinking like a local prevails for me. Apparently, I\u2019m not alone.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not encountering off-brand booze, then you\u2019re not really traveling, are you?\u201d says Shanghai-based Chris Lowder, general manager of the bar consultancy and craft spirits importer Proof & Company in China. \u201cTravel is all about leaving comfort zones behind and understanding how people live in different parts of the world. As far as we know, humans have been drinking alcohol for about 5,000 years, and we\u2019re doing just fine.\u201d\n\nLowder has logged serious miles roaming the world for his work in the beverage industry. The result has been a lot of interesting drinking. In Shanghai, he\u2019s a fan of Huangjiu, a local spirit that tastes like a cross between oloroso sherry, amaro and baijiu. In Seoul, there was the specialty makgeolli bar, where he learned that the unfiltered wine (usually brewed using rice and nuruk, a fermentation starter) could be made with a variety of starch and nut milks with any kind of yeast.\n\n\u201cThe one that surprised me the most was a bottle of peanut milk that had been fermented with champagne yeast,\u201d Lowder says. \u201cEverything was poured from mostly unlabeled plastic bottles, and in the end, we were allowed to buy whatever we wanted to take home.\u201d\n\nLowder doesn\u2019t approach all local alcohol the same way. Distilled alcohol (think vodka, tequila) tends to be fair game for testing, while fermented drinks (beer, wine) require careful treading. Unlike distillates, ferments have a lot of room for error. You want to make sure you\u2019re drinking a product that was fermented in a sanitary setting.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s just a ferment on the street, like a pot of bubbling rice water or something, I usually don\u2019t go for it,\u201d Lowder says. \u201cIf it\u2019s not distilled, you\u2019re really drinking at your own risk. At least if your local cheap hooch is high ABV [alcohol by volume, given as a percent], you know it\u2019s not harboring some colony of death spores that are going to end your life.\u201d\n\nUltimately Lowder is more worried about fake alcohol than incorrectly made booze. With a high-proof distillate, he knows what he\u2019s getting. But counterfeit alcohol is made with the intention of being as cheap to produce as possible and might contain toxic ingredients such as methanol. Counterfeit alcohol has been the culprit in cases of mass death in countries such as Indonesia and India, and has been suspected in relation to recent deaths in the Dominican Republic.\n\n[8 questions about the unexplained tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic, answered]\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of fake alcohol being served in the bottles of many renowned Indian and international brands,\u201d adds Jitender \u201cJeet\u201d Singh, the beverage manager at KYTA Hospitality in Mumbai. \u201cThe government is very strict about this. They regulate it by giving different bar codes and numbers on every single bottle to ensure it is genuine.\u201d\n\nSingh noted that dangerous bootleg alcohol tends to be distributed in smaller towns rather than in India\u2019s big cities. It\u2019s also more commonly found in Indian states where alcohol is banned. To avoid drinking counterfeit or potentially poisoned alcohol, buy drinks from registered stores.\n\nThat being said, Singh still acknowledges that trying local Indian spirits like toddy or palm wine \u2014 alcohol made by fermenting sap from various palm plants \u2014 is a special experience. He recommends using your best judgment when making the call whether to drink something local, and to err toward drinking the creations of people you know: \u201cTry it if you trust the person.\"\n\nGrowing up in Lake Como, Italy, Agostino Perrone could trust the people making the local alcohol: his family. His enthusiasm for experimenting with local booze began when he was a kid drinking grape distillates (similar to grappa) made by his uncle. \u201cIn Italy we have a deep-rooted tradition for homemade products crafted for convivial occasions with friends and family,\u201d Perrone says. \u201cFrom wine to beer, homemade liquors and distilled produce, I have always been exposed to no-label drinks. It is part of our culture.\u201d\n\nPerrone\u2019s exposure to Italy\u2019s artisan alcohol traditions was the catalyst that inspired him to pursue a profession in the drinks industry. Today, he is the man behind the Connaught Bar in London. His refined creations have made the institution a regular fixture on the World\u2019s 50 Best Bars list, put out annually by William Reed Business Media. But his favorite drinking has been done in Mexico, the homeland of his wife.\n\n[A local's guide to London]\n\n\u201cOne of the best memories I have from Mexico is tuba, a fermented coconut water that we tasted with locals at Barra de Navidad, a little fishing town on the coastline of Jalisco,\u201d Perrone says. \u201cThe array of fresh ingredients and artisanal creations you can discover with Mexican people is just incredible, especially if you have the chance to share your experience with them.\u201d\n\nTo feel safe about what you\u2019re drinking, his sentiments echoed Singh\u2019s: Knowing who you\u2019re drinking with helps.\n\n\u201cBeing [in Mexico] with locals I could trust was certainly an advantage, but when traveling, you always need to consider that what tastes familiar to them isn\u2019t necessarily what your palate is accustomed to,\u201d Perrone says. \u201cFor those who are not experts, I would always say that \u2018less is more\u2019 is a great word of wisdom. If the impact doesn\u2019t entice your palate or nose, avoiding is always safer.\u201d\n\nAndrea Villela, an anthropologist by trade, follows that same school of thought when hunting for mezcal in rural Mexico. \u201cSmelling is very important, because our smelling sense is very raw. It\u2019s still connected to survival instincts. Always sip small and smell the cup,\u201d she says.\n\nVillela started a side hustle called La Fiera Mezcal, sourcing mezcal from her home state of Guerrero. She and her mother \u2014 anthropologist Blanca Jim\u00e9nez \u2014 receive tips on mezcaleros making great batches. Then Villela travels to the source to taste it herself, often ending up in remote pockets of the region.\n\n\u201cWe had to go up in the mountains and cross a river that was filled with baby frogs. The water was so clean,\u201d Villela says of one particular mission. \u201cWe got to a point we couldn\u2019t go any farther with the car, so we parked and climbed to find the mezcal master, Don Roberto.\u201d To carry the mezcal back to the car, Villela had to strap the jugs onto donkeys. This precious cargo is then distributed to bar owners, event organizers and guests of the tastings Villela hosts at her house in Mexico City.\n\n[A local's guide to Mexico City]\n\nSince she started La Fiera, Villela has learned to identify good mezcal from bad. She\u2019s had a lot of practice. People bring Villela eclectically packaged samples of their product, or that of the uncle of a friend of a friend, all the time. Then there are the research trips to see mezcal masters, during which she\u2019ll try upward of 10 varieties before deciding on one.\n\nThroughout her experiences, Villela has never been afraid of encountering tainted alcohol. She\u2019s never heard of anyone going blind or being poisoned. She does, however, recognize that not all alcohol in Mexico is safe. Her advice is to drink local spirits slowly \u2014 don\u2019t chug something unfamiliar, or try to mask it with lime. She recommends putting a drop of whatever you\u2019re drinking on your skin first and smelling it to see if it\u2019s adulterated (tampered with). If you don\u2019t like the odor \u2014 especially one that is unpleasantly chemical \u2014 don\u2019t drink it. If you do, sip it and observe your body\u2019s reaction.\n\nWith every chaser of arak I took in Israel, I felt more like a local and less like an outsider. The same was true when I drank ruou in Vietnam, or ya dong in Thailand. Alcohol can help take the awkward edge off when you\u2019re traveling somewhere new. It can give you new cultural insight. It\u2019s a way to bond. And it\u2019s fun.\n\nThe key to adventurous drinking is keeping your guard up before, during and after you\u2019re doing it. Don\u2019t proceed if the contents of your cup, jug, gourd or bottle smell or taste off. Trust your instincts and read the room, Lowder says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in good company, and clearly the locals are acting normal and having a great time, then you know you\u2019re probably in good hands and may be about to have an amazing time.\"\n\nRead More\n\nIn Wales, inventive cocktails without the mumbo-jumbo\n\nIntroducing By The Way, a new digital travel product from The Washington Post\n\nHere\u2019s why you should just take a carry-on, and how to pack it.\n\nFollow By The Way on Instagram for city highlights, travel tips and more", "description": "Plastic jugs.
