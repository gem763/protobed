Blatantly titled \u201cHomicide at midtown Marriott,\u201d the card contained 39 pictures and 12 videos of a man strangling Kathleen Henry to death. In one portion of the footage, her killer can be heard telling her to \u201cjust \u2026 die.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, authorities were alerted to the presence of unidentified human remains near milepost 108 on Seward Highway in southern Anchorage. According to a statement, Anchorage detectives believe the remains are Henry\u2019s. Detectives found timestamps on some of the media, concluding that she was murdered during the first week of September.\n\nDuring that window, suspect Brian Steven Smith was registered at Marriott\u2019s TownePlace Suites. Smith was apprehended at the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport on Tuesday. The 48-year-old South African immigrant did not enter a plea during his arraignment on Wednesday and will likely be assigned a public defender for legal representation.\n\nAuthorities released a statement on Facebook thanking the unnamed citizen for her efforts: \u201cThe Anchorage Police Department extends its gratitude to the citizen who stepped forward with the evidence of this crime,\u201d they said. \u201cThey played an instrumental role in making sure Smith will be held accountable for his actions. This serves as another example of when you see something suspicious, say something.\u201d", "description": "Brian Smith was charged with the murder of\u00a0Kathleen Henry upon the discovery of a memory card allegedly laden with images of the killing.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/putting-sd-memory-card-into-computer-file-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
