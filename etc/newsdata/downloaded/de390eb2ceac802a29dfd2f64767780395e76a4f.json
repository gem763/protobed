The debt collection guidelines recommend that contact with a debtor should not exceed three times per week, or 10 times per month at most,\u201d the recommendation says.\n\nThe recommendation, however, does find largely in favour of Pioneer Credit.\n\nThe case analyst found that the $12,000 debt should stand, that contacting the debtor\u2019s neighbours was appropriate in the circumstances and the threat to list a default was in keeping with the sector\u2019s guidelines.\n\nPioneer Credit and the complainant have 30 days from September 30 to decide whether they accept or reject the recommendation.", "description": "The niche debt collection sector generates one in every 25 complaints submitted to the regulator.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4395%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_414/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7e67c25c68c9b1e33f20d10e8f5ba181b7b6d58a", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
