Not just for Donald Trump, but for Democrats as they hurtle toward an impeachment vote in an election year.\n\n\u201cAs events move, the right will do everything in its power to protect Trump,\u201d Neera Tanden, the president of the left-leaning thinktank the Center for American Progress, wrote shortly after Pelosi\u2019s announcement. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been pushing Dems to fight, I hope you\u2019re prepared for the war that is coming.\u201d\n\nProgressive groups and activists have been laying the groundwork for this moment for months.\n\n\u201cThis is what the \u2018blue wave\u2019 fought for: accountability for Trump\u2019s crimes,\u201d said Leah Greenberg, the co-executive director of the Indivisible Project. Her organization helped lead a summertime campaign to pressure Democratic lawmakers to back impeachment.\n\nNow she says activists will make good on their promise to protect vulnerable Democrats who could face a backlash for their decision to support impeachment \u2013 and to pressure Republicans to act, which is the focus of a new targeted campaign.\n\n\u201cHaving to defend a visibly and openly corrupt president who has flagrantly violated his oath of office is going to have an impact on Republicans,\u201d she said.\n\nJesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist and former top aide to Hillary Clinton, agreed. Democrats who believe impeachment is futile are \u201cunderestimating the pressure\u201d an impeachment vote places on Republicans, he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump insists he has done nothing wrong. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to do a Fox News interview defending the president,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very different when you actually have to take an up or down vote on whether to put the president first or to put the country first.\u201d\n\nFew political observers profess to truly know what the fallout might be.\n\nBut one thing is certain: an impeachment of Trump would push the country into mostly uncharted waters. In modern history, only two presidents have faced impeachment \u2013 Richard Nixon, who resigned before the House voted, and Bill Clinton, who was ultimately acquitted by the Senate. Both presidents were in their second terms at the time. Their impeachment inquiries offer only a crude guide for understanding the political consequences of triggering this constitutional failsafe.\n\nFor months, Pelosi had said impeachment should be a bipartisan effort with broad public support. But she has now moved ahead without either, gambling that Trump\u2019s latest acts will sway public opinion \u2013 and the legions of Republicans who have been loath to cross him.\n\nTrump, faced with the most serious threat to his presidency yet, has sharpened his rallying cry. \u201cPresidential harassment!\u201d he has claimed repeatedly, even as his efforts to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic frontrunner, come into sharper focus.\n\nA memo of his July 25 call with president Volodymyr Zelenskiy released by the White House on Wednesday showed Trump urged the newly elected Ukrainian leader to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations related to Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nTrump has denied exerting improper pressure on Zelenskiy and said the release of the call\u2019s contents revealed nothing inappropriate.\n\nIn many ways the charges echo the allegations Trump faced over his campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia during the 2016 presidential election. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening,\u201d Trump said during the campaign, asking it to help turn up potential dirt on his political opponent at the time, Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut the complex narrative of the Trump-Russia saga at the center of a months-long investigation was a complicated story for Democrats to tell. By contrast, Trump offered a simple defense: \u201cNo obstruction. No collusion.\u201d\n\nEven after the release of a report by special counsel Robert Mueller outlining multiple instances in which Trump allegedly sought to obstruct justice, a majority of the US public oppose impeachment and his supporters remain as loyal as ever despite his low approval ratings.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign immediately fundraised off the impeachment inquiry, and Republicans are targeting vulnerable members who announced their support for impeachment.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it: backing impeachment will cost the Democrats their majority in 2020,\u201d Tom Emmer, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill have amplified the president\u2019s calls for an investigation into unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against Biden and his younger son, Hunter Biden.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s fixation on Biden may help to underscores a central thesis of the former vice president\u2019s candidacy: that he is the Democrat best positioned to beat Trump, said Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n\n\u201cOne of the upshots of this story is that it makes Trump look like he\u2019s afraid of Biden,\u201d Kondik said.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Biden called it a \u201ctragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath\u201d.\n\n\u201cCongress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the groundswell of support for impeachment \u2013 which now includes a majority of House lawmakers \u2013 many Democrats remain unconvinced that it is the best - or right \u2013 course of action.\n\nSome have argued that impeachment would cleave the nation at an especially polarized moment \u2013 and could possibly inflict long-term harm on the office of the presidency. Still, others have questioned the wisdom of impeaching Trump when the Republican-controlled Senate is highly unlikely to convict him.\n\nWilliam Galston, a former adviser to Bill Clinton, urged Democrats to reconsider impeachment and pursue instead a formal censure of the president.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is a constitutional option, not a constitutional obligation,\u201d he wrote in in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt is, in the broadest sense, a political act, and therefore is subject to political tests of feasibility and efficacy.\n\n\u201cIf inaction is dishonorable and impeachment futile, censure is the only course that makes both moral and political sense.\u201d\n\nBut many of the Democratic lawmakers who have come out in favor of impeachment in the recent days argue that Trump\u2019s actions left them no choice \u2013 and said the decision was a matter principle and duty.\n\n\u201cWhen the history books are written about this tumultuous era,\u201d Democratic congressman John Lewis told his colleagues, \u201cI want them to show that I was among those in the House of Representatives who stood up to lawlessness and tyranny.\u201d", "description": "Democratic activists have been laying the groundwork for this moment for months \u2013 but the fight has also galvanised Republicans", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f058e0efbba05598e6bb6bbb3bb30654bda5c9f/0_56_2889_1733/master/2889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cff9493acf1cb033938b4c60151d2cc6", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
