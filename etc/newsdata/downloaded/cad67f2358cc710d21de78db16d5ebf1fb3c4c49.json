REUTERS/Jason Lee/Illustration/File Photo\n\nSterling GBP= swung about a five-month high overnight, knocked around by a series of mixed headlines on the likelihood of progress at an EU leaders summit in Brussels later on Thursday.\n\nIt has surged some 5% since last week as negotiations stepped up, and sat in early Asian hours at $1.2816 per pound. The dollar was steady against most major currencies.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all grateful that we might be coming to some sort of an end to the recent saga,\u201d said Nick Twidale, director of Sydney-based trade finance provider Xchainge.\n\n\u201cAnything that isn\u2019t a hard Brexit is going to be positive for the sterling,\u201d he said, adding a deal or something close to one could push the pound to $1.3500 or above.\n\nFailure could drop it below $1.2200, Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Richard Grace said in a note.\n\nAgainst the euro EURGBP= the pound also stood just under a five-month high at 0.8638 per euro.\n\nThe U.S. dollar had dropped on Wednesday as U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months, painting a gloomy picture of the economy and making a case for rate cuts.\n\nIt was a touch weaker against the euro EUR= at $1.1074 and the Japanese yen JPY= at 108.69, but slightly stronger against the Australian and New Zealand dollars. Against a basket of currencies .DXY the dollar hit a month low of 97.898 overnight and was steady around that level on Thursday.\n\nThe Aussie AUD=D3 weakened a fraction to $0.6755 after a senior Reserve Bank of Australia official said a national property downturn had proven a larger-than-expected drag on the economy.\n\nHowever traders are focused on employment data due at 0030 GMT for the next read on the health of the labor market and the likely outlook for monetary policy.\n\n\u201cIf the unemployment rate rises sooner than we expect ... this increases the risk that the RBA cuts the cash rate in November,\u201d said National Australia Bank\u2019s head of FX strategy, Ray Attril, who anticipates unemployment keeping steady.\n\nLingering worries about trade tensions between the United States and China have also kept investors\u2019 risk appetite in check, weighing on the Aussie and other trade-exposed currencies.\n\nReports of a partial trade deal between the world\u2019s two largest economies last week initially cheered markets, but a lack of details on the agreement has since curbed enthusiasm.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 drifted lower, following dovish comments from a top central banker on Wednesday, and sits at $0.6290, not far from a four-year low hit two weeks ago.\n\nChina\u2019s yuan, which fell on Wednesday as new U.S. legislation backing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong threatened to widen the rift between Beijing and Washington, weakened a little further.\n\nIn offshore trade CNH= the yuan eased marginally to 7.1004 per dollar.\n\nGraphic: World FX rates in 2019 (here)", "description": "The dollar found support on Thursday having weakened on lackluster U.S. retail data, while the volatile pound was on edge as Britain and the European Union scrambled to secure a last-minute Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441688028&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0BV", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
