Now, the National Collegiate Athletic Association has lost control.\n\nOn Monday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law a bill that will allow college athletes in the state to profit off their name, image and likeness, in opposition to the NCAA's bylaws.\n\nNCAA dragged its feet, fell on its face\n\nBy John D. Hollis\n\nThat resounding thud you heard Monday was the end of the NCAA\u2019s unchallenged control of the business of college sports.\n\nWith the simple stroke of a pen, California Gov. Gavin Newsom ushered in a new era by signing into the law the Fair Pay to Play Act that will permit college athletes in the state to accept endorsement money and hire agents starting in 2023. The first of its kind legislation will immediately change the face of a multibillion dollar enterprise built on unpaid labor, and other states will likely follow suit.\n\nThe NCAA is still mulling its response but has already threatened to bar California schools from competition due to fears of the unfair recruiting advantage they would have when the law goes into effect. (As if the threat is actually believable.)\n\nStudy brains before we exaggerate risks: I'm donating my brain to science for the sake of football and facts. Really.\n\nBut the issue has never been about fairness. If that were the case, the NCAA would have listened to its student-athlete constituents whose blood, sweat and tears make member institutions and coaches wealthy without any real compensation in return.\n\nThe NCAA has long fought to sustain its plantation-like system by arguing that the sanctity of college sports requires true amateurism to remain different from the professional ranks. It has long been successful in getting Americans to buy into that mantra, but the tired refrain falls short in today\u2019s age of increasingly socially conscious and media-savvy athletes.\n\nWith good reason, too.\n\nAlabama wide receiver DeVonta Smith in Tuscaloosa in September 2019. (Photo: Vasha Hunt/AP)\n\nMajor college football and basketball \u2014 sports largely dominated by African Americans \u2014 are the NCAA\u2019s golden cash cows that primarily fill the coffers of the Power 5 conference schools largely in the form of merchandise sales and TV rights. Alabama reported making $148.9 million on football in the 2014-15 season, while Ohio State brought in a staggering haul of $167.2 million. Those figures to have only risen, with both traditional power programs again standing an excellent chance at playing in this year\u2019s College Football Playoff as well.\n\nThe same holds true for college basketball, where the NCAA men's basketball tournament has become a nearly billion dollar annual behemoth. According to its most recent TV agreements, the NCAA is slated to make an average of $891 million per year from the next 22 tournaments with an estimated audience of nearly 20 million people tuning in. And those figures don\u2019t include the insane amount of revenue from ticket sales and concessions the college sports governing body will see.\n\nEverybody is enjoying the unprecedented bounty, the universities themselves along with coaches with their own lucrative shoe deals, broadcasters, sponsors, hotel operators and local restaurants. Everybody except the players themselves.\n\nI guess they should just be happy with the few crumbs the NCAA throws them in the form of an annual scholarship not even guaranteed to be renewed each year, content with a little extra pocket change thrown their way to cover expenses while being allowed just to attend those bastions of higher learning.\n\nPuh-lease.\n\nAthleticism isn't everything: Am I the only mom who secretly wishes my kid won't play football?\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I\u2019m all for college sports. I\u2019ve covered major college football and basketball all over the country, and I\u2019ve seen the joy it brings to fans and alums alike. But I\u2019ve also sat in on athletic department budget meetings at a few of the most powerful athletic programs in the country, and I\u2019ve seen the mind-boggling numbers with my own eyes.\n\nI have known a number of young student-athletes who were forced to deal with pressing family financial issues while away from home playing major college football and basketball. They shouldn\u2019t have to help Mom keep the lights on while somebody else is getting filthy rich from their hard work and play on the field.\n\nNobody would blink an eye if a precocious student with a gift for playing the piano were rightfully compensated. It\u2019s about time student-athletes are afforded the same rights as their peers.\n\nThe NCAA has had plenty of time to address the issue, only to intentionally drag its feet. The state of California just took the issue out of its hands, and the world of college sports will never be the same as a result.\n\nJohn D. Hollis, communications manager at George Mason University, covered the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the College World Series, five college basketball Final Fours and major college football and basketball within both the ACC and SEC in 17 years at newspapers.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nNCAA, statement: \"The NCAA agrees changes are needed to continue to support student-athletes, but improvement needs to happen on a national level through the NCAA\u2019s rules-making process. Unfortunately, this new law already is creating confusion for current and future student-athletes, coaches, administrators and campuses, and not just in California. ... As more states consider their own specific legislation related to this topic, it is clear that a patchwork of different laws from different states will make unattainable the goal of providing a fair and level playing field for 1,100 campuses and nearly half a million student-athletes nationwide.\"\n\nScott Martelle, Los Angeles Times: \"The new California law notably doesn\u2019t allow athletes to get paid directly by the schools. That\u2019s a difficult debate ... but it\u2019s grotesquely unfair for universities to earn millions in revenue from sports programs that do not pay the people doing the work that creates the market: the athletes. But that\u2019s a fight for another day. At the very least, student-athletes should be able to profit from their own names and likenesses even if the fame arises from their amateur-level performances. Will that give some schools even more of an advantage than they have now? Probably. But that\u2019s not anywhere near the injustice of people working hard to achieve skills from which others profit. In fact, there\u2019s a word for that: exploitation.\"\n\nAllysia Finley, The Wall Street Journal: \"Letting college athletes cash in appeals both to the free-market right and the social-justice left. Why shouldn\u2019t student-athletes get paid for their hard work and talents, which earn tens of millions of dollars for their coaches, colleges and the NCAA? (But) one irony is that letting student-athletes earn money from endorsements would increase inequality between men and women, which Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments Act was intended to remedy. Men\u2019s basketball and football players would score the biggest endorsements, which would no doubt trigger a push by the left to figure out a way to level the gender paying field.\"\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nWhy do we have athletics in college? It has become the proverbial tail wagging the dog. Professors tell me they are pressured to give passing grades to athletes who are flunking.\n\n\u2014 Brian Ritchey\n\nLove it, and I don't love much about California, but who doesn't want to see someone force the NCAA to evolve?\n\n\u2014 Dara Childs\n\nOnce Texas, Alabama, Ohio, South Carolina and Florida pass similar legislation, the NCAA becomes irrelevant. Anyone remember/care about the National Invitational Tournament in basketball?\n\n\u2014 Chris Stanley\n\nSomeone is going to have to explain to me how kids who willingly and voluntarily accept a college scholarship, knowing the limitations and rules surrounding its acceptance, are having advantage taken of them.\n\n\u2014 David Hoover\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
