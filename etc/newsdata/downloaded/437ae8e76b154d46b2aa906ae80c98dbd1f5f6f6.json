This uncertainty has extended into the wildfire season, exposing not just the shortcomings in PG&E\u2019s fire-prevention efforts but also the threat that fire liabilities still pose to the company\u2019s viability.\n\nNo surprise, then, that state officials are getting restless and looking for bolder ways forward.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has declared that his office would \u201clove\u201d to see Warren E. Buffett\u2019s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, make a bid for PG&E. And Sam Liccardo, mayor of San Jose, favors a sweeping plan that would put PG&E in its customers\u2019 hands.\n\nBut any idea must go through the federal bankruptcy court where two camps of investors \u2014 one aligned with wildfire victims seeking damages from PG&E, and another with management \u2014 have submitted plans to reorganize the company. PG&E, facing an estimated $30 billion or more in liabilities, mainly from fires in 2017 and 2018, sought bankruptcy protection in January. Its stock soared in the following months. On Wall Street and beyond, there was hope that the reorganization would stabilize PG&E, in tandem with a new state fund intended to keep fire liabilities from overwhelming utilities.\n\nBut the company\u2019s shares plunged in recent weeks and even its bond prices weakened, suggesting that investors feared that plans to fix PG&E had fallen short.", "description": "Hedge funds, fire victims and public officials all have a stake in what becomes of the giant utility, now in bankruptcy.
