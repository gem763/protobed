It\u2019s cold, grey, and wet outside. You\u2019ve probably already broken a few New Year\u2019s resolutions, the dream of self-improvement crumbling as you retreat beneath the duvet on dark mornings. And let\u2019s be honest, the world is not a tempting place right now: from the latest Trump fiasco to Brexit rumbling interminably on, every news cycle seems to add to the background hum of anxiety.\n\nBut fear not: television is here to save you. Or at least soothe you. This week, the small screen\u2019s perkiest optimist returns in series four of Netflix\u2019s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. No matter what life throws at her, Kimmy remains a little ray of sunshine. And she's not the only one: our favourite TV characters and shows have a unique ability to make us feel better about the world. So give yourself a break. Snuggle under that duvet. Embrace the comfort viewing.\n\nHere are The Independent\u2019s suggestion of TV series to get you through a hard winter, a hard break-up, or even a hard Brexit.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Shape Created with Sketch. 10 most uplifting TV shows 1/10 Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today. There\u2019s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here \u2013 listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey\u2019s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn\u2019t, well, too fey. Kimmy\u2019s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years; rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there\u2019s still something rather inspiring about that. Eric Liebowitz/Netflix 2/10 The Good Life If you\u2019ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don\u2019t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good\u2019s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy. PA 3/10 Pride and Prejudice The work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC\u2019s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It\u2019s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle\u2019s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there\u2019s the lake scene \u2013 need I say more? Rex 4/10 Five gay American men do a makeover, and it\u2019s fabulous. That\u2019s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise \u2013 Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France dives into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming \u2013 and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they\u2019re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love. Austin Hargrave/Netflix 5/10 Gilmore Girls Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow \u2013 but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Netflix 6/10 Great British Bake Off Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There\u2019s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent \u2013 only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma\u2019s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and Sue/Noel and Sandi keeping things fun \u2013 even when the pressures on \u2013 there\u2019s never a mean-spirited moment. Channel 4 7/10 Bewitched Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that\u2019s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she\u2019s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it\u2019s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that\u2019s always enlivening to watch. Rex 8/10 Brooklyn Nine-Nine Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its diverse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can. Fox 9/10 Inspector Morse A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It's intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw's curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Rex 10/10 Friends Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends\u2019s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are \u2013 but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you're hooked, you'll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into \u2013 which is enough that by the time you're done, you'll be ready to start again.
