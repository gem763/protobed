While the government reportedly would not confirm how many illegals crossed on small boats since December 2018, the broadcaster has collated data, arriving at the number 1,456.\n\nThe broadcaster said the Home Office confirmed just \u201cover 85\u201d were returned \u2014 around six per cent, or one in 17.\n\nMedia reported in the past several months that most are claiming to be from Iran and are seeking asylum in the UK. EU asylum rules dictate that asylum seekers must register for asylum in the first safe country of landing. Given that France is a safe country, all those crossing the Channel are not refugees but illegal aliens and should be deported back to France.\n\nThe spike in arrivals began in December, with 40 illegals crossing the English Channel on Christmas day in five vessels, the highest number of interceptions to date. With landings continuing on every subsequent day, then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid declared the migrant crossings a \u201cmajor incident\u201d. Mr Javid said that talks with his French counterpart would take place to ensure mutual efforts to stop illegal migration.\n\nEven as More Migrant Boats Land, 40,000 Un-Deported Failed Asylum Seekers Remain in UK https://t.co/GdpczhVa5p \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 27, 2019\n\nIn 2003, the UK and France signed the Le Touquet accord which would stop illegals on the shores and ports of France before they try to cross the Channel to England. While French progressives and leftists have threatened to tear up the agreement post-Brexit, it is in France\u2019s best interest to maintain Le Touquet to prevent the country being turned into a transit state for migrants, as the Balkans had been during the 2015 migrant crisis.\n\nIn January 2019, the Home Office decided to increase the number of Border Force cutters in the water. Authorities made the decision despite warnings from former Home Office official David Wood that illegals and smugglers would use vessels as a \u201ctaxi service\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs far as organised crime is concerned, it\u2019s de-risked their business. They know they don\u2019t have to get right across the Channel and land, they can get halfway across and the migrants will be taken the rest of the way,\u201d Mr Wood had said.\n\nNational Crime Agency (NCA) chief Steve Rodhouse told MPs in February that illegals do not fear deportation because they view the UK as a soft touch.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that impacts on this business model [of people smuggling]\u2026 is that people are happy to be \u2014 and are actively seeking \u2014 to be caught or engaging with UK authorities because they don\u2019t fear being returned,\u201d Mr Rodhouse said.\n\nSmugglers Claim French Police Helping Illegals Get to UK https://t.co/1LmIo98ZTB \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 1, 2019\n\nLandings also occurred throughout the warmer months, with Conservative MP for Dover Charlie Elphicke warning that the \u201ccrisis now threatens to turn into a Summer of chaos on the Channel\u201d.\n\nIn early June, the coastguard responded to a \u201crecord number\u201d of 13 incidents in one day, with the coastal MP criticising the Home Office for failing to \u201cget a grip on this crisis\u201d that had begun six months before.\n\nIn August, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that migrants would be returned to France after coming across the Channel illegally.\n\n\u201cThe UK should not be regarded as a place where you could automatically come and break the law by seeking to arrive illegally,\u201d Prime Minister Johnson said.\n\nThe Home Office told Sky News that while asylum seekers should seek refugee status in the first safe country of landing, the UK has an \u201cobligation to give all claims fair consideration\u201d.\n\nThe spokesman said: \u201cWe are working closely at all levels with the French authorities to tackle this dangerous illegal activity.\n\n\u201cWhere possible, we work with European countries to return eligible asylum seekers. However, we have an obligation to give all claims fair consideration, and not all cases are straightforward.\u201d", "description": "The Conservative government has deported just six per cent of illegals who crossed the English Channel since December.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/Migrant-boat-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
