At no point was the maker of the Genesis and Dreamcast the worldwide leader in video games. When it succeeded in America, it fell short in Japan, and vice versa. The Genesis Mini is an encapsulation of that moment when it came closest to victory \u2014 a reminder of what the Genesis was, but also what it could have been.\n\nTo be released on September 19, the $139.95 Sega Genesis Mini includes 42 classic games from the 16-bit system\u2019s lifespan. That\u2019s a hefty amount, exactly double that of Nintendo\u2019s SNES Classic. It also includes two of the classic three-button Genesis controllers, an HDMI cable, and a USB cable with AC adaptor \u2014 in other words, everything you need to play right out of the box.\n\nThe hardware is a thing of beauty, a perfect little recreation of the 1989 launch model Genesis. The Genesis Mini goes a step further than other classic mini-hardware with interactive elements. The volume control slides up and down, the spring-loaded dust-cover flaps covering the cartridge slot open and close, and you can even remove the cover for the port that would connect the real Genesis to a Sega CD.\n\nHere\u2019s one of those photos you always have to have in these reviews, with a picture of a Mini on top of the real thing. (Photo: Chris Kohler, Kotaku)\n\nNone of these things actually function, of course. You can\u2019t play Genesis cartridges on this machine, nor is there a proportionally-sized Sega CD attachment that will let you play Sewer Shark (although surely we can all agree that we would immediately buy such a product). But they make the Genesis Mini itself into a fun little toy even before you turn it on.\n\nThe included controllers feel like exact replicas of the original, massive, croissant-shaped pads that shipped with the first model of the Genesis. This is where you may feel that Sega has made a misstep with the Mini, since it includes these 3-button pads and not the 6-button controllers that were produced later.\n\nIn Japan, the 6-button pads are included; here, they are an extra $30 purchase. Most of the games only use three buttons anyway, but for the ones that offer 6-button support (most notably Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition), you\u2019ll have to pay up.\n\nEven though the controllers use USB, you can\u2019t just plug in any old USB controller and have it work on the Mini \u2014 you\u2019ll need an officially licensed controller from Retro-Bit. Sega sent samples of the 6-button controllers, which were excellent.\n\nThey were helpful even for games that don\u2019t need six buttons, since you can press the \u201cMode\u201d button to open the system menu. To get to the menu with a 3-button pad, you have to hold down the Start button for three seconds, which is annoying.\n\nShining Force. (Screenshot: Kotaku, Sega)\n\nSo was it a mistake to include 3-button pads? I\u2019m leaning toward \u201cno.\u201d The appeal of a mini-console like this isn\u2019t just the gameplay; it\u2019s also having that little replica of the thing itself.\n\nMost people who played the Genesis back in the day used these controllers. It completes the nostalgic circle to boot up Sonic the Hedgehog again and feel one of these big chonky bois in your hands just like you remember.\n\nLike Nintendo\u2019s classic systems, the Genesis Mini has original menu-screen music composed in classic chiptune style. Unlike Nintendo\u2019s systems, the tune here is composed by the king of 16-bit music himself, Yuzo Koshiro (Streets of Rage and Actraiser among others). The new music is what the kids today call a \u201cbop.\u201d I enjoy just letting it run and listening to it. They even timed the boot sequence of the Mini to the music. That\u2019s attention to detail!\n\nThe Mini is low on software features. It\u2019s got the obvious stuff: You can choose to either view the games in their proper 4:3 aspect ratio or be weird and stretch them out like a wacky carnival mirror across your whole TV.\n\nYou can turn a \u201cCRT filter\u201d on and off for fake scanlines, and you can apply one of two different wallpapers to the blank space around the 4:3 image. There\u2019s a \u201csave anywhere\u201d feature with four slots per game. And that\u2019s about it. I would have really liked to see a Rewind feature like the SNES Classic\u2019s.\n\nWonder Boy In Monster World. (Screenshot: Kotaku, Sega)\n\nBut all this would be meaningless without some games to play, and at 42 titles, Genesis has the most of the major minis. When you think about your childhood playing the Genesis, what game do you immediately flash back to? NBA Jam? Joe Montana Football? Aladdin? Mortal Kombat?\n\nOh. Well, um, none of those are on this.\n\nThere\u2019s an obstacle for the Genesis Mini that the SNES Classic doesn\u2019t really have to deal with. If you look at the best-selling games for the SNES, most of the games in the top 20 are on the SNES Classic.\n\nBut look at the best-selling games for Genesis and you can see the problem: sports licenses, movie licenses, and fighting games that would earn this box a \u201cMature\u201d rating.\n\nGoing hard after hot licenses and pumping out games branded with big-name movies, pro athletes, and sports franchises was all part of Sega\u2019s game plan in the 1990s. And it worked! But it also left modern-day Sega with a library of software that\u2019s practically unreleasable today. This means that if, like many American Sega fans, you did a lot of sports gaming on your Genesis, you won\u2019t find that experience here.\n\nSega definitely made an attempt to get some games made for Western audiences onto the Mini, like Earthworm Jim, Vectorman, and Road Rash II. But by and large, we\u2019re looking at a lineup of stylish Japanese action games, JRPGs, and shmups.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like the sort of Genesis collection you\u2019d find in the home of someone who prefers the Super Nintendo. It\u2019s a Genesis collection for me, in other words, so I\u2019m not complaining.\n\nContra: Hard Corps. (Screenshot: Kotaku, Sega/Konami)\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of games. I have played each of these games, some of them for hours (Shining Force), some of them for a couple minutes (Earthworm Jim). I will hereby arbitrarily and irrevocably arrange them into four tiers: A Tier, B Tier, C Tier and Virtua Fighter 2 For The Genesis Tier.\n\nA Tier\n\nCastlevania: Bloodlines\n\nShining Force\n\nGunstar Heroes\n\nShinobi 3\n\nContra: Hard Corps\n\nBeyond Oasis\n\nPhantasy Star 4: The End of the Millennium\n\nWonder Boy in Monster World\n\nStrider\n\nMonster World 4\n\nAlisia Dragoon\n\nDynamite Headdy\n\nB Tier\n\nSonic The Hedgehog\n\nEcco The Dolphin\n\nDr. Robotnik\u2019s Mean Bean Machine\n\nComix Zone\n\nCastle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse\n\nWorld of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck\n\nThunder Force 3\n\nStreets of Rage 2\n\nSonic The Hedgehog 2\n\nLandstalker\n\nStreet Fighter 2: Special Champion Edition\n\nGhouls \u2019n Ghosts\n\nGolden Axe\n\nTetris\n\nDarius\n\nColumns\n\nSuper Fantasy Zone\n\nC Tier\n\nSpace Harrier 2\n\nToeJam & Earl\n\nAltered Beast\n\nEarthworm Jim\n\nMega Man: The Wily Wars\n\nAlex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle\n\nSonic the Hedgehog Spinball\n\nVectorman\n\nRoad Rash 2\n\nKid Chameleon\n\nEternal Champions\n\nLight Crusader\n\nVirtua Fighter 2 For The Genesis Tier\n\nVirtua Fighter 2\n\nAs you can see, no matter where you\u2019d personally rank these games, the Genesis Mini has a deep bench. To give the console a wider variety, Sega decided to follow a one-game-per-series rule, with limited exception. While I appreciate the effort at diversity, I don\u2019t think they should have been so strict about it.\n\nI would have preferred to play the original Streets of Rage, or Shining Force II, instead of\u2014let me just pull one out of a hat here\u2014the Genesis version of Virtua Fighter 2, a game that probably shouldn\u2019t have ever even existed and really didn\u2019t need to be resurfaced here.\n\nBut in general, the lineup is strong. Previous small Genesis consoles didn\u2019t truly represent the best of the best that the platform had to offer. Here, finally, we have top-tier action games like Gunstar Heroes and Castlevania: Bloodlines.\n\nWe skip to the end of the Wonder Boy in Monster World series to get to the two that are basically side-scrolling JRPGs, underappreciated in their own time but still sharp today.\n\nSNES Classic featured an unreleased game from the 1990s, Star Fox 2, so of course the Genesis Mini had to double that count as well, adding the unreleased Genesis version of Tetris and a hardcore fan\u2019s ported version of the arcade game Darius.\n\nSince we\u2019re throwing back to the 1990s here, I\u2019m going to reach back into my turn-of-the-century video game enthusiast magazine vocabulary and pronounce these a \u201cmixed bag.\u201d Darius is lots of fun but this port of Tetris is fairly anemic. SNES Classic wins the \u201cunreleased game\u201d wars, but that\u2019s probably because only Nintendo would have ever shitcanned a perfectly good game in the first place.\n\nSega Genesis Mini BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE All the games you didn't buy in the \u201990s, but should have. TYPE OF GAME Nostalgia enhancement engine LIKED Tons of games including the Genesis' top-tier titles, great emulation, detailed hardware design, multiple ROM versions. DISLIKED Left off some true classics to make room for worse games, could have used more features like Rewind. DEVELOPER Sega / M2 PLATFORMS Plug-and-play RELEASE DATE September 19, 2019 PLAYED About 10 hours; played at least a bit of every game.\n\nThere\u2019s one other important bonus feature that exemplifies how the Genesis Mini feels like more of a passionate fan project than a bland marketing tool. You can set the menu to display in many different languages, which changes the entire menu design.\n\nThe menu\u2019s look will match that region\u2019s Genesis logo and design, switching to the \u201cMega Drive\u201d name for Europe and Japan. And if applicable, the games themselves will play in that language, using alternate ROM files. Beyond Oasis actually had, for example, a French-language version.\n\nSome games differed in more than just their languages. If you switch the language to Japanese, Dr. Robotnik\u2019s Mean Bean Machine will revert back to its original Japanese version, Puyo Puyo. Other differences are more subtle but still significant, like how the Japanese version of Contra: Hard Corps gives the player a three-bar life metre instead of one-hit kills.\n\nOr you could just play the Japanese version of Street Fighter II because you want \u201cM. Bison\u201d to be named \u201cVega.\u201d I\u2019m not here to judge. This extra-mile approach makes Genesis Mini a much more thorough exploration of the era than competing tiny boxes.\n\nThe Genesis Mini\u2019s menu screen when the language is changed to Japanese. (Screenshot: Kotaku, Sega)\n\nOne wonders, on the eve of this very cool device\u2019s release, if Sega has missed the window on the mini-console craze. The market was positively flooded with copycat devices in the wake of the NES Classic\u2019s huge success, and the bad taste of the ill-done PlayStation Classic still hasn\u2019t fully washed out of our collective mouths.\n\nWill people line up to buy another tiny console this holiday and reward Sega for its Herculean, if belated, efforts here? Those who do add another Mini to the pile will, at least, not be at all disappointed with this one.", "description": "Sega was always more loved than it was successful.
