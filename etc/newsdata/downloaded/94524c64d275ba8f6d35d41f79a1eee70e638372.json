Sunday's in Osaka was a harsh one.\n\nThe 31-19 defeat by Tonga was harsh because it extended the Americans' losing run to 10 at the World Cup, equaling the team's worst ever at the tournament. Harsh because it came against a team that's in the same second tier of rugby as the U.S., not a top-tier giant of the game. And harsh because the U.S. was leading at halftime and had a chance to extend its lead early in the second. Then, almost in an instant, the game was gone.\n\nUp 12-10, the U.S. kept hold of the ball through nearly 20 bruising phases in its final Pool C game and was a meter from the Tongan line. The ball was spilled, the Tongans counterattacked from 100 meters, and suddenly the U.S. was losing. Four minutes later Tonga scored again, and the game was gone.\n\n\"That's the game of rugby, that's life in the arena,\" U.S. captain Blaine Scully said. \"All we can really do is squeeze every ounce of learning out of this experience. Hopefully, that can catapult the team for the next four years in the (World Cup) cycle.\"\n\nThe U.S. needs to get out of the cycle of defeat, if only just for one game. The last time the team won at the Rugby World Cup was against Russia in 2011. If it loses its first game in four years' time in France, it'll be the worst run by the Americans ever at the World Cup.\n\nUnited States' Marcel Brache runs at the Tongan defence during the Rugby World Cup Pool C game at Hanazono Rugby Stadium between USA and Tonga in Osaka, Japan, Sunday, Oct. 13, 2019.

None more so than you can't concede the tries we have.\n\n\"It's extremely important for us to be able to play those (top) teams. There's deep disappointment at the moment, but this has been an unbelievable opportunity for us to play against these Tier One teams and you know they're putting their best teams on the field. We'll definitely become a better team because of it.\"\n\nGold is hopeful of the knock-on effect of the newly formed Major League Rugby, hopeful that the U.S. will nail down specific elements of its game - like defense and the set-piece - and hopeful the U.S. might bid and get to host the 2027 Rugby World Cup.\n\nThat would be an immense boost, he said. Look at what it's done for Japan.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nUnited States' Mike Te'o scores a try as Tonga's Malietoa Hingano, right, watches during the Rugby World Cup Pool C game at Hanazono Rugby Stadium between USA and Tonga in Osaka, Japan, Sunday, Oct. 13, 2019.
