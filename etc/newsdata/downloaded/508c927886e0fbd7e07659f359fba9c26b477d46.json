He told Business Insider of his plans to move to Los Angeles, with no major career commitments yet aside from teaching a finance software course at Stanford University.\n\nChavez rose up the bank's ranks over his 19-year stint at Goldman, starting as a commodities staffer before moving up to serve as chief information officer, then chief financial officer, and eventually coheading Goldman's trading business.\n\nHe also known as a champion for diversity in the investment banking industry. As openly gay and Latino, Chavez represented several identities not typically seen on Wall Street, and especially not in bank leadership.\n\nChavez worked on Wall Street for 26 years and will be succeeded by investment banking cohead Marc Nachmann.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nWeWork's business model has created a new 'financial security risk' that could tank the economy, Boston Fed president says\n\nTop Juul investor Altria has seen $30 billion \u2014 almost a third of its market value \u2014 erased since the FDA launched a vaping investigation in April\n\n'This is now a new era': A Wall Street quant guru says FOMO is driving 'very strange' behavior in markets \u2014 and describes how he's positioned to profit from the anomaly", "description": "Coding will be as important for future traders as 'writing an English sentence,' Goldman Sachs' tech evangelist Marty Chavez told Bloomberg Friday.
