(Photo: Joel C Ryan, Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP)\n\nKeira Knightley never officially announced her pregnancy, or the birth of her second child, another girl, a couple months ago.\n\nShe and husband James Righton are notoriously quiet about their children, but as the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" star returns to work, we are soaking up a few details about the newborn and her life as a mom of two.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Telegraph, it was revealed that her new daughter's name is Delilah. The couple also shares 3-year-old Edie.\n\nEdie and Delilah...adorable!\n\nKnightley has been out-and-about talking about her role in a new film \"Official Secrets.\" The movie is based on true events when British intelligence specialist Katharine Gun, played by Knightley, received a memo from the NSA with a shocking directive ahead of the Iraq War.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nKnightley is refreshingly open about going back to work as a new mom and trying to keep up with breastfeeding and pumping in her interview with the outlet.\n\n\u201cThree whole feeds,\u201d she told The Telegraph. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be apart for six hours in total, so I pumped three feeds\u2019 worth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t do it, my boobs will explode,\u201d Knightley explains. \u201cI mean, quite literally. It\u2019s going everywhere. So, you know, that\u2019s not happening. The pump is with me. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nEarlier in October, Knightley sat down with Louise Minchin on BBC Breakfast and admitted she was still in the newborn fog.\n\n\"I can't remember what your question was. You can tell I have a 6-week-old baby, haven't you? I'm talking but I have no idea where I'm going,\" Knightley says.\n\nWhile the actress shared that she had a team of stylists help her get ready up for the interview, she had a encouraging message for \"normal\" new moms.\n\n\"(That) you should still be in your pajamas and don't brush your hair and let the house be a complete mess and only see people who are going to bring you food,\" she says.\n\nWhether Knightley is in a fancy ballgown or pajamas, we do know she is raising her daughters to be \"queens,\" not princesses.\n\n\"Of course (my daughter Edie) wants to be a princess,\" Knightley told USA TODAY last year. \"And I\u2019m like, 'You don\u2019t want to be a princess, you want to be a queen. Because queens are in charge!'\"\n\nShe also shared that she is very careful about what fairy tales she lets her daughter watch because of the messages they send.\n\n\"The Little Mermaid\" and \"Cinderella\" have been banned, but she supports \"Moana\" and \"Frozen.\"\n\nElsa and Anna. Edie and Delilah. We see a queen movie in their future.\n\nFollow the latest from USA TODAY Parenting at usatoday.com/life/parenting.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/23/keira-knightley-reveals-daughters-name-james-righton/4070670002/", "description": "Keira Knightley and her husband James Righton quietly welcomed their second daughter together a couple months ago.", "authors": ["Amy Haneline", "Published P.M.
