It doesn\u2019t bode well for the country if the man aiming to become our next chancellor of the exchequer can\u2019t add up.\n\nRoger Hinds\n\nSurrey\n\nBrexit and Gibraltar\n\nIt is perplexing that the rock of Gibraltar has virtually disappeared from any public debate on Brexit. Gibraltar remains a deeply contentious issue for Britain and Spain especially with the surge of nationalism and anarchist and separatist voices in Catalonia. Although it has close similarities with Northern Ireland, there is no talk about it remaining or leaving the European customs union. Nor is there mention of becoming an antithesis to the geographic integrity of Spain or a threat to the cross border movement of goods, people, vehicles, labourers and tourists between mainland Spain and the UK. Brexit might be much more complicated than Boris Johnson et al foresee.\n\nDr Munjed Farid Al Qutob\u200b\n\nLondon NW2\n\nElectoral reform\n\nIt is good to see a letter in your paper from the Electoral Reform Society (Letters, 7 October). It reminded me that a considerable time ago I contacted the society to ask for its view on the system of weighting MPs votes in the Commons in proportion to the number of votes it took to get party or independent members elected. The society replied that it was minded to agree with Roy Jenkins' report on proportional representation in which he said, and I paraphrase, I can't be bothered to think about this idea.\n\nI still don't understand why the weighted vote idea is not worth considering, and would be delighted if someone would explain what is wrong with it.\n\nI would also be delighted to hear what the Society has proposed (and achieved) over the years.\n\nTony Baker\n\nThirsk\n\nScottish independence\n\nKeith Howell suggests (Letters, 7 October) that voters will be disinclined to vote Labour at the next election because they fear a Labour government would agree to a referendum on Scottish Independence.\n\nHe presumably means English Labour voters, as in Scotland there is not enough of them to fill a telephone box. Will they then be attracted to the Tories whose members were recently surveyed to be prepared to sacrifice Scotland and even Northern Ireland if it would lead to a hard Brexit?\n\nScotland was conned in the last independence referendum to vote for the Union to maintain membership of the EU. It is the right of the Scottish people to determine their future. They will not make the same mistake again.\n\nKenneth Paterson\n\nLinlithgow\n\nHave XR gone too far?\n\nWhen Extinction Rebellion started up last year, I was unsure about them. I was (and still am) in complete agreement that climate change is an urgent and extreme threat to an organised and peaceful society. I thought their own organisation was chaotic and over-idealistic, and their representatives sometimes ill-informed. But I was prepared to give them time to mature as a movement. They have failed in that respect. Rather than appreciate how their part in raising awareness is rapidly reaching the previously ignorant, uncommitted or obstructive to such arguments, they have failed to consider the extent of the inevitable kickback to their continued disruption.\n\nIn the same way that Republican supporters are loving the \"Make America Great Again\" packs of environmentally destructive plastic straws promoted by Mr Trump, I predict that bloody-minded and reactionary elements of society will now deliberately and successfully deny the environmental messages that are so important. XR should have sat back and waited a little to see how their early work might have taken on a life of its own. They might argue that there\u2019s no time, but there\u2019s even less if what they are saying is ignored.\n\nPatrick Cosgrove\u200b\n\nShropshire", "description": "I have always been a fan of Heidi Allen since she first made her maiden speech in parliament and along with Sarah Wollaston, who both stood out as\u00a0true examples of \"One Nation\"\u00a0conservatism which has since hit the buffers and has become a right-wing ideological faction, led by a prime minister who appears to support this trend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/07/19/front-7-10-19-heidi-allen-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
