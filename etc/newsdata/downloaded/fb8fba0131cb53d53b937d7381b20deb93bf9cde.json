As the child walked away, both of the candy bars slid off the top of the costume.\n\nTwitter users were incredulous.\n\n'Did these a**holes just put candy on a kid's head?' one asked.\n\nAnother quipped: 'Good god. These people can't even hand a child candy in a normal manner,' while someone else noted: 'He can't even do this right.'\n\nComedians including Jimmy Kimmel also noted that it was inappropriate for the White House to play Michael Jackson songs.\n\nThe late singer's legacy has taken a beating over the last year amid new allegations that he molested children. His estate furiously denies them.\n\nAt the White House event, one of the songs on a spooky playlist was Thriller.\n\nKimmel, a vocal critic of the president, said during his show: 'The president and first lady were there handing out candy.\n\n'And what kind of music do you play when you have a bunch of little kids coming over? That\u2019s right.\n\n'Michael Jackson. I guess\u2014maybe they don't get HBO at the White House.'", "description": "The child was among a line-up of kids in costume who trotted up to the Trumps to be given candy on Monday night.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20378768-0-image-a-19_1572448038645.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
