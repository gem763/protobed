Amazon, for example, went public in 1997 with a market cap of just $382 million. Google took the plunge 8 years later at a $23 billion market cap, still just a fraction of its subsequent worth.\n\nCombined, the two companies raised less than $100 million in venture capital \u2014 in a pre-cloud era of higher fixed IT costs.\n\nToday, 4 different startups announced $100 million+ rounds.\n\nThe current environment was created by 3 main factors:\n\nLow interest rates. This forced investors to search for yield, in order to beat the benchmarks, and that leads to increased interest in alternative assets like venture capital and growth equity. Included in the rush have been startup \"tourists\" like mutual fund, hedge fund and sovereign wealth fund managers. Bull public equity markets.

It's possible this would increase a relaxing of accredited investor rules, which conflate wealth with sophistication.\n\nAlso last week, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the matter. This was the one in which Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez mistakenly suggested that retail investors had access to WeWork, and therefore got \"fleeced\" by its recent valuation drop.\n\nBipartisan consensus is that D.C. must make it easier for startups to go public, so that they'll no longer want to remain private.\n\nBut it's not filing costs or reporting requirements that are creating \"unicorns\" on the sidelines.\n\nIt's broader market conditions, which only have been exacerbated by recent policy pushes: White House pressure to lower interest rates even further, corporate tax cuts juicing public equities, Clayton and the SEC's refusal to revisit the 500 shareholder rule change.\n\nThe bottom line: D.C. can help mom and pop, but only if it first comes to grip with how it hurt them.\n\nGo deeper: The 55 minotaur companies", "description": "Main Street investors are being shut out of private capital formation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/UOmkdW-D0RXKiRJi8f4OPyeStPo=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/09/18/1568816087323.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
