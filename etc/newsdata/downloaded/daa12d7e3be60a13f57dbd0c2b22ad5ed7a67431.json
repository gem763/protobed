In August, the regulator postponed its decision on the proposal \u2014 together with two other crypto ETF applications \u2014 until Oct. 13. It now has no mechanism that allows to postpone any longer, Hougan underscored:\n\n\u201cSometime before Monday, the SEC has to give its decision: yes or no. They have no more ways to postpone it at this point. We will hear clearly between now and Monday what they think.\u201d\n\nDespite the regulator\u2019s repeated pushback against previous proposals, Hougan is positive about the prospects this time:\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, there were no regulated, insured custodians in the Bitcoin market. Today, ... there are big names like Fidelity and CoinBase [with] hundreds of millions of dollars of insurance from firms like Lloyd\u2019s of London.\u201d\n\nHe added that, in contrast with two years ago, six of the ten major crypto exchanges are now regulated by the New York Department of State (NYDS) and have market surveillance technologies in place.\n\nForemost, he argued, today\u2019s market sees over $200 million in volume, with regulated Bitcoin futures traded every day \u2014 again, a stark change from a formerly \u201cone-sided, inefficient market,\u201d according to Hougan.\n\nThe involvement of major market makers such as Jane Street Capital and Susquehanna has transformed Bitcoin into one of the \u201cmost efficient institutional markets in the world,\u201d he added.\n\nBenefits of a Bitcoin ETF\n\nHougan argued that ETF approval would herald a major opportunity for everyday investors to access the Bitcoin space securely. He noted:\n\n\u201cWhile big institutions have safe, secure ways to buy Bitcoin in private funds that are available only to the ultra-high-net-worth people, regular investors don\u2019t have a safe way.\u201d\n\nAn ETF would enable financial advisors to bring Bitcoin to their clients easily \u201cinstead of them going rogue,\u201d Hougan added.\n\nThis August, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley took a similar perspective to Hougan, citing positive developments in the industry such as Susquehanna\u2019s entrance, improved arbitrage and new spreads, and access to extensive insurance policies.", "description": "Executives at Bitwise Asset Management are highly optimistic as the deadline for the U.S. SEC\u2019s decision on their proposed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund nears", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYjRjOGYxMzg0ZTUwNzBiZTIzZDgxZGY2NGQ1NDVkY2EuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
