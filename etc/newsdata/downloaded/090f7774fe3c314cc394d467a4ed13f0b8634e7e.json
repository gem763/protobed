It\u2019s endless.\n\nLet me share my latest worry with you. I have somewhat of a reluctant reader at home. I do see glimmers of hope, when she picks up and devours a graphic novel on a weekend when we have no activities scheduled, but, I have to admit, I want her to grow into a full-on book nerd.\n\nSo\u2026 I did some research, and here are a few things I can recommend to you, if you too are a mom with a reluctant reader at home or you\u2019re just not sure how to encourage your young reader to take time to enjoy a book by themselves.\n\nHow to encourage them to get started:\n\n\n\n1. Let them choose the books they like\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, this will not be easy. You may have dreams of them devouring Little House on the Prairie or a Newbery Medal winner, but they turn to the Magic Kitten series instead. That\u2019s okay. Part of the fun for them is going to a bookshop or the library and finding something that interests them, and making that choice for themselves.\n\n2. Make sure there is time in their day for reading\n\nKids are busy these days. Much busier than we used to be, and let\u2019s not get started on the amount of homework! It might be time for you to reassess the amount of after-school activities they are involved in, or to carve out some space during the weekend for reading. And, you can even get crafty with the actual experience, perhaps create a reading tent for the weekend and sit in there with them, reading your own book.\n\n3. Have lots of books available\n\nHaving lots of books at their reading level at home will encourage them to pick one up. Scatter them all around the house. Trawl the secondhand bookshops, get library books that you think will interest them, and start decorating your home with words! And remember, the books don\u2019t have to all be fiction. If your kid loves science, look for books with fun experiments. If they hate the idea of just seeing pages of text, look for graphic novels or chapter books full of illustrations.\n\nWhen they\u2019ve found the one they love:\n\n1. Find more of the books they love\n\nIf they have found a book that peaks their interest, go hunting for more books by the same author. Support and encourage their love of a series and, if there is a movie of the book, rent it as soon as they have finished the book. I can guarantee a lively discussion will ensue about if and how the movie lived up to the book and what they had imagined.\n\n2. Bring it into everyday life\n\nIf you\u2019re reading the book with them, quote a fun phrase from the book or bring the characters into your everyday life by asking what they might do. What do you think Laura would have made for lunch everyday? Do you think Harry enjoyed doing orals? And if you\u2019re not reading the book with them, ask them about it - why they love it so much, who the characters are and if and how they might approach situations in our daily lives?\n\n3. Reward their time spent reading\n\nWhen they\u2019ve finished a book by themselves, make sure to praise them\u2026 you could even slip a little reward in too! There\u2019s nothing like a trip to their favorite play park or buying them something they\u2019ve wanted for ages, to say, \u201cMmm, maybe I should read another book!\u201d\n\nIf they dislike a book they are required to read:\n\n1. Try make the book an experience\n\nNow, you\u2019re going to have to get creative and spend a lot of your mom energy here. Try and turn the story they may not be enjoying into an experience by: cooking a dish inspired by the book, going to the museum, tackling a science project, drawing, writing, painting - whatever is relevant to the book. This will help them connect the character or storyline to their world.\n\n2. Develop criticism skills\n\nIt\u2019s fine if they don\u2019t like a book their school requires them to read, but unfortunately they still have to finish it. So talk about it, help them develop a good criticism for why they don\u2019t like the book. Make sure you encourage their point of view, and maybe even ask them to write their own review.\n\n3. Again, reward them for finishing\n\nDangle a little carrot in front of them, as an incentive to finish the book.\n\nDo they struggle with reading on an academic level?\n\nI recently came across an interesting UK website by publishers Barrington Stoke. Their focus is on publishing \u201csuper-readable, accessible books that help every child experience the joy of reading\u201d.\n\nAnd, with a focus on children who struggle to read because of dyslexia or visual stress, they have a \u2018reading age\u2019 test on their website - which is a good, simple test to find out where your child\u2019s reading level is.\n\nOnce you know your child\u2019s reading level, it will be easier to find the kinds of books that won\u2019t be stressful for them and that they will, hopefully, enjoy reading.
