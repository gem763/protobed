Overturning an election should be a rare event, undertaken in only the most extreme circumstances. The process would create deep wounds in an already divided nation. And, as a practical matter, since it\u2019s highly unlikely that a Republican-controlled Senate would vote by a two-thirds majority for conviction, the political effect could well be to vindicate Trump and aid his reelection.\n\nBut the events of the last few weeks have led to me to support an impeachment inquiry. Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the new Ukrainian government, including his phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, were profoundly wrong. To direct American foreign policy for personal political gain is the definition of abuse of power. Even many Trump defenders argue that what he did was bad but does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.\n\nWhat has been far more troubling is Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Other presidents have contested a specific subpoena or request for documents. Trump is effectively rejecting Congress\u2019 ability to hold him accountable. Even his staunch defender, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page, conceded that Trump\u2019s central argument, that the congressional inquiry is unconstitutional, is nonsense. \u201cThe House can organize impeachment more or less as it wants. \u2026 Like the president\u2019s pardon power, the House\u2019s impeachment power is among the least fettered in America\u2019s founding charter.\u201d\n\nThe rule of law has been built over centuries in the Western world, but it remains fragile because it is based on a bluff. The bluff is that, at the highest level, everyone will respect the rules even though it might not be possible always to enforce compliance.\n\nThe rule at the heart of the American system is the separation of powers. The founders\u2019 greatest fear was that too much power in the hands of government would mean the end of liberty. So they ensured that power was shared and that each branch would act as a check on the other. The crucial feature for James Madison, the chief architect of the Constitution, was \u201cgiving to those who administer each department, the necessary constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist encroachments of the others.\u201d As he explained in Federalist 51: \u201cAmbition must be made to counteract ambition.\u201d\n\nBut the system only works if all sides respect it. At the end of the day, Congress does not have an army or police force at its disposal. Nor does the Supreme Court. These institutions rely on the president to accept their authority and enforce their laws and rulings. When the Supreme Court held unanimously that President Richard Nixon could not use \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d to withhold the Watergate tapes, Nixon immediately agreed to comply, even though he knew it would mean the end of his presidency. More recently, when Britain\u2019s high court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of Parliament had been unlawful, he instantly explained that while he disagreed, he would respect the ruling.\n\nAll modern U.S. presidents \u2014 both Republican and Democratic \u2014 have expanded their powers, and that expansion has been especially excessive in the past few decades. But Trump is on a different planet. He has refused to comply with wholly constitutional legislative requests for documents, information and testimony. He has diverted money toward a project clearly not funded by Congress, reportedly promised pardons for officials who might break the law, suggested that the military shoot migrants (which is unlawful), and now doubled down on his rejection of congressional oversight over him. Were Trump\u2019s position to prevail, the American president would become an elected dictator.\n\nThe Democrats, meanwhile, are on firm constitutional ground but are being politically unwise. They should ensure that this impeachment inquiry is and looks fair. They should follow the precedents laid down during the last two impeachment investigations. At the end of the day, impeachment is a political process, which means that public support is vital. The American people may be more inclined to support impeachment after the Ukraine revelations, but it remains wary. The inquiry should be undertaken as a great act of public education, about the specifics on this case, but also about the American system of checks and balances.\n\nA democracy can turn into a tyranny not all at once, with a bang, but over time. Officials, often elected, often popular, can simply decide to weaken and then dispense with constitutional constraints or legislative checks. Liberty is eroded slowly but steadily. The Weimar Republic was a well-functioning liberal democracy that, within a few short years, using mostly legal processes, became a totalitarian dictatorship. Reflecting on that history, Yale\u2019s Timothy Snyder writes, \u201cThe conclusions for conservatives of today emerge clearly: Do not break the rules that hold a republic together, because one day you will need order.\u201d\n\nFareed Zakaria\u2019s email address is comments@fareedzakaria.com.", "description": "", "authors": ["Fareed Zakaria"], "top_image": "https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SCS-placeholder.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
