I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General [William] Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I\u2019m sure you will figure it out.\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, soliciting a\n\n\u201cthing of value\u201d for his reelection from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\n\non July 25\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, Donald Trump famously said he could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters.\u201d\n\nNow, based on a common-sense reading of the White House\u2019s own rough transcript, Trump has fired the campaign-law equivalent of a Fifth Avenue gunshot. Will he lose any Republican lawmakers?\n\nLet\u2019s step back.\n\nForget, for the moment, whether there was an implicit or explicit quid pro quo in Trump suspending and dangling aid to Ukraine just before he asked Ukraine\u2019s president for help dishing dirt on his likeliest 2020 opponent.\n\nForget, too, whether there was \u201cpressure\u201d applied.\n\nForget the whistleblower\u2019s (well-supported) allegations that the White House attempted a coverup after the conversation, or that Trump\u2019s lieutenants followed-up extensively with Ukraine.\n\nForget Rudy Giuliani\u2019s back-channel diplomacy and the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nForget that the White House and the Justice Department attempted to quash the whistleblower complaint.\n\nForget that Trump essentially confirmed the veracity of the complaint by calling those who provided information for it \u201cspies\u201d and suggesting they committed the capital offense of \u201ctreason.\u201d\n\nAnd forget the umpteen other instances of Trump\u2019s lawbreaking, abuse of power and obstruction of justice, 17 of which I outlined this week.\n\nEven setting all of that aside, what the White House put out this week was enough: The president broke the law when he solicited political help from Ukraine. In doing so, he put his political interests above the national interest. How can Republicans defend the indefensible?\n\nWell, they claim that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d (Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C.), that it\u2019s a \u201che said, she said\u201d case (Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, Tenn.), that the whistleblower had \u201czero first-hand knowledge\u201d (House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, La.) or \u201cpolitical bias\u201d (Rep. Devin Nunes, Calif., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Calif.), that \u201cthese attacks are lies\u201d (Rep. Jeff Duncan, S.C.) or, contrary to the evidence, that the real villain is Joe Biden.\n\nNunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, unfurled all manner of diversion at Thursday\u2019s hearing with the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire: \u201cinformation warfare operation . . . Russia collusion hoax . . . hearsay . . . cabal of leakers . . . another Steele dossier . . . Russia hoax [again] . . . public spectacle . . . Fake news. . . Russia hoax [yet again] . . . Democrats doing the exact same thing . . . Joe Biden . . . Fusion GPS . . . Nude pictures of Trump . . . unhinged and dangerous . . . dishonest, grotesque . . . charade.\u201d (Nunes demonstrated his seriousness earlier this year when he sued a fictitious cow that mocked him on Twitter.)\n\nA paltry few \u2014 among them Sen. Ron Johnson (Wis.), Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.), Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah), Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Rep. Will Hurd (Tex.), Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) and Rep. Michael Turner (Ohio) \u2014 have expressed at least some squeamishness over Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nBut we\u2019re not hearing Republicans defend Trump\u2019s illegal behavior \u2014 because there is no defense.\n\nMcCarthy simply pretended it didn\u2019t happen. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear: The president did not ask to investigate Joe Biden,\u201d he told reporters. (Which part of \u201clook into it,\u201d \u201cget to the bottom of it\u201d and \u201cfigure it out\u201d did McCarthy not understand?)\n\nPressed on whether Trump did \u201canything wrong,\u201d McCarthy said it was \u201cthe question that Democrats are not asking: Did he do something wrong? They have raised this to impeachment.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy, though he struggles with spoken English, stumbled onto inadvertent honesty: Trump might have done wrong, but McCarthy thinks the transgression isn\u2019t impeachment-worthy. Fair enough. But Trump\u2019s violation of the law is as clear as if he shot somebody on Fifth Avenue. Trump\u2019s partisans are free to choose their president over the law, but make no mistake: This is the choice they face.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "Trump has fired the campaign-law equivalent of a Fifth Avenue gunshot.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
