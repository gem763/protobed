However, the case against him has since been discontinued at a magistrates\u2019 court.\u2019\n\nThe development is said to have disappointed AJ, who has hoped his attackers would be brought to justice.\n\nA friend of the Strictly star reportedly told Sunday People: \u2018He\u2019s very upset. He feels justice has not been served. He\u2019s been the victim of a violent crime and nothing has been done.\u2019\n\nThe pair suffered multiple injuries (Picture: ITV, Rex Features)\n\nThe brothers went on to have a pretty stellar 2019 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe attack injured both brothers with AJ suffering bruising to his face, arms, body and legs, while Curtis underwent surgery to correct knee damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecalling the horrific incident, Curtis said on This Morning in January: \u2018I can only say perhaps it was jealousy, because AJ was doing a couple of photos with people. He\u2019s a good looking lad. I was the one getting asked to take the photos, which is fine.\u2019\n\nAJ added: \u2018If someone comes up to me and asks me for a photo, if they do it politely, I\u2019m always going to say yes.\n\n\u2018The really sad thing in this scenario was that we were just out to have a good time, and it came from nowhere. There was none of us in the first place causing a hassle or anything, we were not there for that scenario, that\u2019s what is really sad for us.\u2019\n\nFollowing their ordeal, the Pritchard brothers have enjoyed a pretty stellar 2019 with AJ returning to this series\u2019 Strictly Come Dancing, and Curtis becoming a star in his own right after appearing on Love Island this summer.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
