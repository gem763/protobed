More than 850,000 crossed into the U.S. illegally. Of those, nearly a half-million of the migrants were family units.\n\nDuring Fiscal Year 2019, which ended on September 30, U.S.Border Patrol agents and CBP officers apprehended more than 1,148,000 migrants who crossed the border from Mexico into the U.S., according to year-end numbers released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Tuesday in El Paso. The El Paso Sector witnessed the largest percentage increase of illegal border crossings in all categories.\n\nThe apprehension of migrants illegally crossing the border is at the highest level since 2007, when agents apprehended 858,638. The apprehension of family units was not tracked in 2007, but this year marks a record for the category\u2013473,000. This number is nearly quadrupled 2018\u2019s report of 107,490 migrant family apprehensions. Prior to that, there had never been more than 100,000 family apprehensions in a single year.\n\nApprehension numbers declined during the last four months of the fiscal year after peaking at 132,589 in May, according to previously published reports. This is due in part to new Mexican immigration procedures negotiated by the Trump Administration.\n\n\u201cIn just a 24-hour period, we recorded more than 5,800 people in a single day back in May,\u201d CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan told reporters at a press conference in El Paso on Tuesday. \u201cOn a single day back in May, we actually had 20,000 individuals in custody. We have a capacity of 4,000.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, these immigration procedures broke up a caravan consisting of approximately 2,000 from Central America, Africa, and the Caribbean Islands, Breitbart Texas reported. The group began to move northward from Tapachula, Chiapas, early one-morning after being held up for official travel documents. The group quickly encountered Mexican Federal Police and members of the newly formed National Guard.\n\nWhen the group came upon the police and soldiers, some scattered while others surrendered.\n\n\u201cThis caravan no longer exists,\u201d migrant rights advocate Irineo Mujica told the AP.\n\nWhile the number of migrants apprehended while crossing the border into the U.S. fell during the last four months, Commissioner Morgan stated the numbers are still at crisis levels.\n\n\u201cSo last month it was down to 52,000,\u201d Morgan stated. \u201cBut that\u2019s still a significant increase from this time last year.\u201d Morgan compared May\u2019s daily peak of nearly 6,000 to the September daily average of 1,400 apprehensions per day. \u201cThat\u2019s still at crisis levels.\u201d\n\nFamily unit migrant crossings are of particular concern to CBP officials due to the increase in resources required to care, transport, and process them.\n\nDuring FY2019, Border Patrol agents apprehended 473,682 Family Unit Aliens, according to the 2019 Southwest Border Migration Report. This is an increase of nearly 350 percent over last year\u2019s record apprehension of 107,212 family units. The apprehension of Unaccompanied Alien Children also increased by 52 percent to 76,020.", "description": "The apprehension of migrants who crossed the border into the U.S. reached 1.1 million during Fiscal Year 2019.", "authors": ["Bob Price"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/40439689293_5b195090be_k-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
