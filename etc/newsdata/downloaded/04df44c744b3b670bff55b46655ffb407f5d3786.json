The French have mastered the je ne sais quoi.\"\n\nLike any big city, though, figuring out where to shop in Paris can be daunting.\n\nThere's a lot of ground to cover and if you don't have a general idea of what you want and where you want to go to find it, you can whittle away your days there without significant shopping success -- not that slowly meandering through the streets of Paris is a bad way to spend any given day.\n\nRead on for our picks of the six best shopping streets and neighborhoods:\n\nSaint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s\n\n\"If you only shop one Parisian neighborhood, Saint-Germain is it,\" advises Maxwell, who admits she's biased because this is where her flat in Paris is. Home to the city's oldest church, the medieval Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, and the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, the area feels historic but also vibrating with contemporary life, like much of Paris.\n\nThe Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s neighborhood is rich with history and covetable shopping opportunities. Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn days she wants to be a shopping flaneur, as the French call one who wanders aimlessly, Maxwell has a routine.\n\n\"Start with a coffee at Cafe de Flore, then stop by Buly 1803 to pick up a stunning perfume or body oil.\" And bonus: Maxwell says the on-site calligrapher will personalize a box for free if you want to make one of their sumptuous products a gift.\n\nShe traipses over to Rue Bonaparte to explore European brands (Ba&sh, Lancaster Paris, Bimba y Lola and Des Petits Hauts are all neighboring shops), nibbles one of the city's best pastries at Pierre Herm\u00e9 and then hits \"the best department store in the world,\" Le Bon March\u00e9, which hosts art installations and shoppable exhibits such as the current So Punk Rive Gauche\n\nWhen you need a break for espresso or a glass of ros\u00e9, there are cafes aplenty in Saint-Germain, such as Le Bar du Marche. Shutterstock\n\nPark-Goude also loves Le Bon March\u00e9, regularly stopping by the \u00e9picerie, for \"edible accessories\" and condiments for the night's dinner.\n\nShe also likes the boutiques that stock small Parisian designers, like Irie, where she worked when she first moved to the city, as well as sleek interior design shops Adele Shaw, Cassina and Galerie MCDE.\n\nIf you stumble down to Rue Madame, Maxwell says, and into Maison Kitsun\u00e9 (which just opened its first restaurant in Paris), \"you're off the beaten path on a residential street, but you feel like you're a cool kid in the Marais.\"\n\nLocals swear by Paris' apothecary CityPharma, which Maxwell says is \"worth the chaos for the best priced and stocked pharmacy, with dozens of associates to help you stock up on lotions and potions.\"\n\nIn this neighborhood, when shopping hour ends and happy hour/dinnertime begins, there are as many cool restaurants and bars as there are stores.\n\nBuly 1803 , 6 Rue Bonaparte, Paris, France, 75006; +33 1 43 29 02 50\n\nBa&sh , 2 Place Michel Debr\u00e9, Paris, France, 75006; +33 1 43 35 41 37\n\nBimba y Lola , 66 Rue Bonaparte, Paris, France, 75006; +33 1 42 38 84 12\n\nDes Petits Hauts , 70 Rue Bonaparte, Paris, France, 75006; +33 1 75 44 05 82\n\nLe Bon March\u00e9 , 24 Rue de S\u00e8vres, Paris, France, 75007; +33 1 44 39 80 00\n\nIrie , 8 Rue du Pr\u00e9 aux Clercs, Paris, France, 75007; +33 1 42 61 18 28\n\nAdele Shaw for Society Limonta , 33 Rue Jacob, Paris, France, 75006; +33 1 42 60 80 72\n\nCassina , 236 Boulevard Saint-Germain, Paris, France, 75007; +33 1 42 84 92 92\n\nGalerie MCDE , 1 Rue Saint-Beno\u00eet, Paris, France, 75006; +33 1 47 03 97 35\n\nMaison Kitsun\u00e9 , 38 Rue Madame, Paris, France, 75006; +33 1 53 71 76 62\n\nCityPharma , 26 Rue du Four, Paris, France, 75006; +33 1 46 33 20 81\n\nAvenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\n\nPacked with tourists, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es offers both a great photo-op and lots of big fashion retailers. Jacques Demarthon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne of the most famous avenues in Paris, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es historically housed big luxury fashion brands such as Louis Vuitton, Cartier and Guerlain. More recently, mainstream brands such as the Gap, Zara and H&M have planted flags there.\n\nLocal fashion lovers may avoid this area, likening it to Times Square in New York as both are saturated with tourists and not particularly unique in terms of shopping. But if you're a Paris newbie, the avenue is worth at least a quick stroll, particularly during the holidays when seasonal markets pop up.\n\nPark-Goude notes that a new outpost of the department store Galeries Lafayettes has opened up there, with a \"high-end selection, more international designers, and a terrific basement beauty section.\"\n\nWhen you're ready for a break from l\u00e8che-vitrine loosely translated as \"window shopping,\" pop into the most famous location of macaron and tea caf\u00e9 Ladur\u00e9e for a sweet and relax taking in the view of the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nGaleries Lafayette Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es , 60 Av. des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, 75008 Paris, France; +33 1 83 65 61 00\n\nLadur\u00e9e , 75 Av. des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, 75008 Paris, France; +33 1 40 75 08 75\n\nRue Saint-Honor\u00e9\n\nJust steps away from the Louvre and the Tuileries Garden, Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 is \"the ultimate street for window shopping at la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of French designer brands,\" including Herm\u00e8s, Goyard and C\u00e9line, says Maxwell. This isn't the area for fast fashion, but walking this area delivers an essential slice of Paris.\n\nOn Rue du Fauborg Saint-Honor\u00e9, you'll find a number of French luxury fashion houses, including Herm\u00e9s. Stephane De Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe upscale street also includes smaller shops, such as housewares and candle maker Astier de Villatte, and a number of upscale jewelry stores such as Boucheron and Graff, anchoring the early 18th century square Place Vend\u00f4me.\n\nTourist alert: This street confusingly changes names, to Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, when it crosses Rue Royale. \"Faubourg\" loosely translates to \"outside the city\" in Latin, and the Faubourg part of the street was initially situated outside of city walls. But locals consider it essentially one street/area, all ripe for high-end shopping.\n\nPart of the joy of shopping in Paris is seeing centuries-old monuments, such as the column of the Place Vendome off Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9.

Baleydier/SIPA/AP\n\nRue de Rivoli is a very long street, spanning about 6.4 kilometers (4 miles) and offering a wealth of treasures, from mainstream street fashion to small indie boutiques. You could easily spend an entire day on Rue de Rivoli, getting lost into all of the side and cross streets -- and if time permits, you should.\n\nOne section not to miss: the eastern end of the street, past H\u00f4tel de Ville, that runs into Le Marais district.\n\nOne Paris local calls department store BHV/Marais a \"modern-day upgraded Sears\" where one can find \"everything and anything.\" Romuald Meigneux/SIPA/AP\n\nA not-to-be missed flagship is Le BHV/Marais (the acronym stands for Bazar de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville) -- it's \"a modern-day upgraded Sears,\" says Park-Goude. \"I am there at least once a month, for everything and anything, from hardware to fashion, to the hip terrasse bar Le Perchoir.\"\n\nFrom there until where Rue de Rivoli turns into Rue Saint-Antoine, the street is packed with clothing and accessories boutiques, vintage stores and plenty of spots to stop for an espresso, snack or verre du vin.\n\nHead north from Rivoli up any of the cross streets -- Rue des Archives, Rue Vieille du Temple -- into the heart of Le Marais for small boutique heaven.\n\nThe Marais, Park-Goude says, is \"the best neighborhood for shopping. It's so eclectic, you can find everything there.\" She loves exploring the northern Marais for curated clothing shops such as The Broken Arm and stopping at Breizh caf\u00e9 for traditional Brittany crepes or a gelato at Grom.\n\nA visit to the cool Le Marais district in Paris won't be complete without a stop at the concept store Merci, which also houses a \"used book cafe\" and a cantina. courtesy of Merci\n\nDon't leave Le Marais without a visit to Merci, says Maxwell, \"an iconic concept store with a cultlike following that changes themes throughout the year,\" to get affordable gifts such as string bracelets, and then refueling with an Israeli snack at Miznon.\n\nLe BHV/Marais , 2 Rue de Rivoli, Paris, France, 75004; +33 9 77 40 14 00\n\nThe Broken Arm , 12 Rue Perr\u00e9e, Paris, France, 75003; +33 1 44 61 53 60\n\nMerci , 111 Boulevard Beaumarchais, Paris, France, 75003; +33 1 42 77 00 33\n\nBreizh , 109 Rue Vieille du Temple, Paris, France, 75003; +33 1 42 72 13 77\n\nGrom , 16 Rue Vieille du Temple, Paris, France, 75004; +33 1 53 69 14 45\n\nMiznon , 22 Rue des Ecouffes, Paris, France, 75004; +33 9 71 34 53 84\n\nBoulevard Haussmann\n\nThe Haussmann-Op\u00e9ra is \"your go-to for big department store shopping,\" says Maxwell.\n\nAlong or just off of Boulevard Haussmann are the original Galeries Lafayette (and its Gourmet and Maison outposts across the street), as well as Printemps.\n\nPrintemps, billed as the largest beauty department store in world, anchors Boulevard Haussmann for many Parisians. Shutterstock\n\nPlus there are your standard fast-fashion brands such as H&M and Uniqlo, as well as the ubiquitous Sephora and Apple stores and more.\n\nWhich is not to say it isn't a pleasant experience! Recommends Maxwell: \"Pop up to the top level of Printemps to take in the sights and sip a caf\u00e9 at one of the few rooftop cafes in the city, then take a quick stroll down to the opera house Garnier and take in its magic opulence!\"\n\nGaleries Lafayette , 40 Boulevard Haussmann, Paris, France, 75009; +33 1 42 82 34 56\n\nPrintemps , 64 Boulevard Haussmann, Paris, France, 75009; +33 1 42 82 50 00\n\nCanal Saint-Martin\n\nThe Canal Saint-Martin snakes through upper Eastern Paris and is a less touristy, arty-hip area with a bit more obscure boutique stores. Francois Guillot/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnother off-the-beaten path neighborhood for small boutiques, cafes and bars is the area around Canal Saint-Martin, including Rue des Vinaigriers and Rue de Lancry.\n\n\"It's a grungier neighborhood, but authentic,\" explains Park-Goude, and great for people-watching.\n\nShe likes to pop into Artazart bookstore and old Paris standby fashion shop Agn\u00e9s B, pause for a coffee at Prune Caf\u00e9, and maybe later a glass of wine and some tapas at Le Verre Vol\u00e9.\n\nDo make time for a drive-by at least of art studio-concept boutique Melange, hipster vintage shop Thanx God I'm a VIP and women's boutiques Make My Lemonade and Antoine et Lili.\n\nFancy a nosh in between shops? Grab a gluten-free bread -- yep, they do that in Paris! -- at Sain Boulangerie and sit along the canal for views you'll write home about.\n\nArtazart , 83 Quai de Valmy, Paris, France, 75010; +33 1 40 40 24 00\n\nAgn\u00e9s B , 13 Rue de Marseille, 75010 Paris, France; +33 1 42 06 66 58\n\nMelange , 65 Rue de Lancry, Paris, France, 75010\n\nThanx God I'm a VIP , 12 Rue de Lancry, Paris, France, 75010; +33 1 42 03 02 09\n\nMake My Lemonade , 61 Quai de Valmy, 75010 Paris, France; 33 9 67 42 23 97\n\nAntoine et Lili , 95 Quai de Valmy, Paris, France, 75010; +33 1 40 37 41 55\n\nChez Prune, 36 Rue Beaurepaire, Paris, France, 75010; +33 1 42 41 30 47\n\nLe Verre Vol\u00e9 , 67 Rue de Lancry, Paris, France, 75010; +33 1 48 03 17 34", "description": "Paris offers some of the best shopping in the world.
