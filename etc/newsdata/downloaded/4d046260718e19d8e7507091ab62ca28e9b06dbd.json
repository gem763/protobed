We must stop Brexit.\n\n\u201cAnd we are crystal clear: a Liberal Democrat majority government will revoke Article 50 on day one.\u201d\n\nIn a scathing attack on Boris Johnson, she will compare the prime minister to a \u201csocialist dictator\u201d for his suspension of parliament, his purge of internal party critics and his threats to ignore a law barring a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.\n\nAnd she will cast doubt on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s conversion to support for a second referendum, making clear she blames his lukewarm campaigning for the Leave victory in 2016.\n\n\u201cIf he had campaigned to Remain in 2016 with half of the energy he put into the 2017 election, we may have seen a different result,\u201d she will say.\n\nDeriding Labour\u2019s convoluted promise to negotiate a Brexit deal only to put it to a referendum, she will say: \u201cNigel Farage might be Brexit by name, but it is very clear that Jeremy Corbyn is Brexit by nature.\u201d\n\nAnd she will make a special plea to voters in strongly Remain-backing Scotland to rally round the Lib Dems as the only national party in the coming election standing unequivocally for blocking Brexit.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Come with us to stop Brexit.\u201d\n\nMs Swinson will describe as \u201csickening\u201d Mr Johnson\u2019s willingness to consider a no-deal Brexit in spite of the gloom-filled warnings of potential chaos set out in the government\u2019s own Operation Yellowhammer planning document.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, you can\u2019t plan for no deal,\u201d she will say.\n\n\u201cPlanning for no deal is like planning to burn your house down. You might have insurance, but you\u2019re still going to lose all your stuff.\u201d\n\nAnd she will add: \u201cThere is no Brexit that will be good for our country.\n\n\u201cBrexit will put lives at risk. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, doctors are worried about the impact that delays at borders will have on the supply of time-sensitive radiopharmaceuticals. That\u2019s cancer patients waiting longer for scans and treatments as a direct consequence of government policy.\n\n\u201cBrexit will hurt our economy. Thousands of car manufacturing jobs already lost: Honda in Swindon; Jaguar Land Rover in Birmingham; Ford in Bridgend; Nissan in Sunderland. And more, if we leave.\n\n\u201cThis Brexiteer government want to pay for their ideology with other people\u2019s jobs.\u201d\n\nMs Swinson has had to fend off allegations at the Bournemouth gathering that her willingness to revoke Article 50 is \u201canti-democratic\u201d.\n\nSenior Lib Dem MP Sir Norman Lamb warned that the policy was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d and risked breaking the social contract with voters.\n\nBut she told Sky News: \u201cIf we win a majority in parliament on the very clear position of stopping Brexit then that will be a mandate to do that. People would expect us to do what we\u2019ve said we would do in that election campaign.\n\n\u201cDemocracy did not end on 23 June 2016. I\u2019ve spoken to plenty of people who have changed their mind since that time.\u201d\n\nBut Conservative chair James Cleverly said: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats\u2019 extreme policy on Brexit is neither liberal nor democratic. The Lib Dems are determined to cancel the largest democratic vote in British history without so much as a whimper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking that a party which was once such a keen advocate for a referendum is now so eager to trample over democracy. They won\u2019t get Brexit sorted and instead will, just like the Labour Party, create more dither, and delay.\u201d", "description": "Liberal Democrats will halt Brexit \u201con day one\u201d if they win a parliamentary majority in the snap election expected within weeks, leader Jo Swinson is promising.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/15/14/swinson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
