To call out abuse of power", "language": "en", "text": "America is in a full-blown constitutional crisis for one reason: The fox has mostly been left in charge of the henhouse. These days, virtually any attempt at assigning responsibility and accountability at the president\u2019s feet \u2014 however factually and legally legitimate \u2014 is met with howls of outrage. Of course, this construct gets it all wrong. The American revolutionaries fought and died for independent self-governance \u2014 not so they could crown an American king.\n\nAfter Watergate, lawmakers realized that transparency and accountability in government are vital to a functioning democracy. Congress passed the Inspector General Act of 1978. Under the original statute, President Jimmy Carter Jimmy CarterCarter recovering after suffering fall at his home The Hill's Morning Report - New impeachment battle: Pompeo vs. House Dems The Hill interview: Buttigieg opens up about faith MORE appointed 12 inspectors general (IGs).\n\nToday, that number has grown to 73. Executive branch agencies have their own IGs, whose job it is to ensure that agencies are operating within the boundaries of the law and in compliance with government standards.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIGs perform regular audits to identify and investigate fraud, criminality, misconduct, waste of funds and abuses of office. They keep an eye on a wide array of people, including internal government employees, external contractors, and grant or loan recipients. For Americans who distrust government spending, IGs are a very good thing.\n\nAlthough IGs are part of the agencies they are charged with auditing, higher-ups cannot stop IGs from conducting investigations. IGs hire their own people (including financial auditors and even armed criminal investigators), issue their own subpoenas for documents, and have authority to take their own witness testimony. Their ability to function without day-to-day oversight is why IGs are loosely termed \u201cindependent.\u201d\n\nBy necessity, IGs work hand-in-hand with whistleblowers \u2014 people inside the agency who decide to \u201cblow the whistle\u201d on potential wrongdoing that might not otherwise come to light.\n\nWhistleblowers are not spies or treasonous actors \u2014 as President Trump Donald John TrumpWhite House says Turkey will soon launch Syria operation Trump associates pressured Ukraine over gas firm in order to benefit allies: report Trump praises Woodward, slams other journalists over 'Face the Nation' segment MORE irresponsibly accused the whistleblower who complained of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he asked Zelensky to do the \u201cfavor\u201d of investigating his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump associates pressured Ukraine over gas firm in order to benefit allies: report Trump praises Woodward, slams other journalists over 'Face the Nation' segment Why Elizabeth Warren will fail to shine in her moment on the trail MORE and his family. To the contrary, the whistleblower tradition is deeply entrenched in our system of government. In 1778 \u2014 a decade before ratification of the Constitution itself \u2014 the continental Congress passed a whistleblower statute to address allegations of prisoner abuse within the United States Navy.\n\nPotential misconduct by an actual IG is investigated by a separate independent entity, the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. That body can look into a complaint about an IG, but it has no authority to act on it. Credible allegations of IG wrongdoing boomerang back to the agency head and, ultimately, to the president.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll told, an IG works for the people of the United States \u2014 not elected politicians and appointed officials. Yet, as Philip Rotner writes in The Bulwark, the president\u2019s appointment power leaves even these watchdog positions vulnerable to political capture. Moreover, unlike special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerFox News legal analyst says Trump call with Ukraine leader could be 'more serious' than what Mueller 'dragged up' Lewandowski says Mueller report was 'very clear' in proving 'there was no obstruction,' despite having 'never' read it Fox's Cavuto roasts Trump over criticism of network MORE \u2014 who could only be removed for \u201ccause\u201d under Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations \u2014 IGs can generally be removed by the president for political or even retaliatory reasons.\n\nWhich brings me to a recurring problem with our system of separated government as it\u2019s playing out under the current president: Too many roads lead back to the president himself.\n\nUnder federal law, the White House is not considered an \u201cagency,\u201d and it does not have its own IG. The whistleblower who raised alarm over the July 25 call and possible coverup is a U.S. intelligence official stationed within the White House. Instead of filing the complaint with a non-existent White House IG, he or she filed the complaint with the IG of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson. Under the controlling statute, Atkinson found the complaint \u201ccredible\u201d and of \u201curgent concern\u201d and forwarded it to the Director of National Intelligence Joseph McGuire.\n\nWe know how the rest of the story goes: Rather than send it to Congress as the plain language of the statute required, McGuire sought the advice of DOJ, which of course is headed by Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrHouse GOP Intel member: 'Why should I care about' another Trump whistleblower Trump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy Attorney says he's representing second Trump whistleblower from intel community MORE \u2014 a staunch defender of Trump personally. That office proceeded to bury the complaint until Atkinson notified Congress of its existence.\n\nThe IG system was set up to deal with wrongdoing by people within the executive branch \u2014 not wrongdoing by the person at its very apex. The apparatus assumes that the president will uphold the rule of law and, barring that, that Congress will address any \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d as a last-straw measure through impeachment. But of course, the viability of the constitutional impeachment prerogative requires that Congress learn of presidential wrongdoing in the first place.\n\nThe framers of the Constitution knew that it\u2019s human nature to amass, entrench and abuse power to the detriment of regular people. Even if we optimistically assume that American democracy survives its latest series of body blows, it\u2019s probably not going to be the last time a president will abuse the power of his or her office.\n\nIdeally, Congress would step up and pass substantive legislation to close the gaping loophole that the whistleblower process tolerates \u2014 but luckily circumvented \u2014 this time. More than any other position in government, the presidency requires a system of checks and balances that\u2019s nearly foolproof.\n\nKim Wehle is a former assistant U.S. attorney and a former associate independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation.
