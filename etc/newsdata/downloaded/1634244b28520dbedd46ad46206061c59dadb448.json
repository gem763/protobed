REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\nThe AMA, one of the nation\u2019s most influential physician groups, also called on doctors to inform patients about the dangers of e-cigarettes, including toxins and carcinogens, and swiftly report any suspected cases of lung illness associated with e-cigarette use to their state or local health department.\n\nThe recommendation followed advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday for people to consider not using e-cigarette products while it investigates the cause of the spate of severe lung illnesses associated with vaping.\n\nMany, but not all, of the cases have involved those who used the devices to vaporize oils containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis.\n\nCDC officials said some laboratories have identified vitamin E acetate in product samples and are investigating that as a possible cause of the illnesses.\n\nPublic health experts have not found any evidence of infectious diseases and believe the lung illnesses are probably associated with a chemical exposure.\n\nMegan Constantino, 36, from St. Petersburg, Florida, quit vaping six days ago after hearing reports of the illnesses and deaths related to vaping.\n\n\u201cIt scared me into quitting,\u201d she said.\n\nLike many users of vaping pens, Constantino picked up the device after quitting cigarette smoking three years ago, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI threw the last cartridge away. I took a picture of it and I literally cried.\u201d\n\nConstantino said many people who vape have been \u201con pins and needles\u201d for the investigation results, and she is concerned that the reports of a link to vaping THC may give people an excuse to ignore the warnings.\n\nE-cigarettes are generally thought to be safer than traditional cigarettes, which kill up to half of all lifetime users, the World Health Organization says. But the long-term health effects of vaping are largely unknown.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has faced mounting pressure to curb a huge spike in teenage use of e-cigarettes, a trend that coincided with the rising popularity of Juul e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cWe must not stand by while e-cigarettes continue to go unregulated. We urge the FDA to speed up the regulation of e-cigarettes and remove all unregulated products from the market,\u201d AMA president Dr. Patrice Harris, said in a statement.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nGregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, which advocates for cigarette smokers to switch to nicotine-based vaping devices, said the AMA should be \u201cashamed of themselves for playing politics with people\u2019s health and protecting the profits of drug dealers.\u201d\n\nHe criticized the AMA for \u201cfearmongering about nicotine vaping products\u201d while not mentioning \u201cthe very real risks of vaping illicit THC products.\u201d\n\nJuul Labs declined to comment.
