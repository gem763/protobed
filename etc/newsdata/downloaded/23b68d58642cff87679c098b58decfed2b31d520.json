(Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)\n\nST. LOUIS \u2014 Washington Nationals Manager Dave Martinez underwent a diagnostic procedure called a cardiac catheterization Monday after experiencing chest pains, General Manager Mike Rizzo said. Martinez will remain in Washington for precautionary medical testing while the Nationals begin a series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Rizzo, speaking to reporters Monday afternoon at Busch Stadium, said he did not have any timetable for when Martinez could rejoin the club.\n\n\u201cThis is something we have to take care of,\u201d Rizzo said in the doorway to the visitors\u2019 clubhouse before the series opener. \"We are certainly \u2014 when we get all the results back, we will have a game plan in place and get him back here as soon as we can.\u201d\n\nMartinez, 54, left the Nationals\u2019 7-0 win over the Atlanta Braves on Sunday during the sixth inning. He wasn\u2019t feeling well and his condition worsened over the course of the afternoon, so the team\u2019s training staff decided it was best for Martinez to be checked out at a nearby hospital. He was replaced by bench coach Chip Hale, and Hale will continue as the Nationals\u2019 interim manager until Martinez is back. Hale managed the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2015 and 2016 and had a 148-176 record before he was fired.\n\nCardiac catheterization, according to the Mayo Clinic, \u201cis a procedure used to diagnose and treat certain cardiovascular conditions. During cardiac catheterization, a long, thin tube called a catheter is inserted in an artery or vein in your groin, neck or arm and threaded through your blood vessels to your heart. Using this catheter, doctors can then do diagnostic tests.\u201d\n\nRizzo spoke with Martinez following the procedure Monday and felt the manager was \u201cupbeat\u201d and in good spirits. Rizzo repeatedly referred to it as a \u201cminor procedure.\u201d The general manager added that there will be more test results that will determine Martinez\u2019s status moving forward.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be kept there for some routine blood work and examination, and he\u2019ll be back with the team when he feels up to it,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cWe have no other information. We have to wait until we get all the tests.\u201d\n\nWith Hale stepping in as manager, Tim Bogar will be his bench coach and Joe Dillon, the club\u2019s assistant hitting coach, will replace Bogar as first base coach. Hale spoke with reporters Monday afternoon and mentioned that Martinez texted in the lineup for the night\u2019s game against the Cardinals. He expects Martinez to remain involved from afar, and he even joked that Martinez could send messages through clubhouse attendants if he wants Hale\u2019s attention.\n\nHale otherwise stuck with the simple approach of keeping everything the same. He didn\u2019t get dressed in the manager\u2019s office. He still bounced around the field during batting practice as he typically does, chatting with other coaches with his glove on. He wants the entire staff to have input on decisions, whether it be bullpen moves, pinch-hitters or other situations throughout the game.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s a player or a coach, somebody in the organization, the first thing you want is for everybody to be healthy and be able to do what they want to do,\u201d Hale said. \"So it\u2019s scary. But obviously things are going well, and everything they\u2019ve put him through, everything\u2019s been great. We expect to get him back soon.\u201d\n\nTo this point of his second season managing the Nationals, a stretch of 310 games, Martinez had only ever missed innings by being ejected. So it will be different for the players to not see him perched on the dugout steps in St. Louis on Monday. They began asking Sunday afternoon why Martinez wasn\u2019t around. After the game, before boarding buses to the team charter, Rizzo gathered the team and explained that Martinez was undergoing tests for chest pains.\n\nThen the Nationals flew west toward another game. Their pregame routines didn\u2019t change. There was just one person missing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re used to the same guy being there, telling us what he expects from us, for the most part,\u201d shortstop Trea Turner said. \"I know [the] whole staff is there, but just having him at the top of it, it will be a little different without him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to battle just like any other day and play the game hard, and hopefully we\u2019ll get a win for him.\u201d\n\nLINEUPS\n\nNationals (82-66)\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nStephen Strasburg P\n\nCardinals (83-66)\n\nDexter Fowler RF\n\nKolten Wong 2B\n\nPaul Goldschmidt 1B\n\nMarcell Ozuna LF\n\nPaul DeJong SS\n\nYadier Molina C\n\nTommy Edman 3B\n\nHarrison Bader CF\n\nDakota Hudson P\n\nRead more:\n\nBoswell: The Nats\u2019 bullpen will be better in October \u2014 if they make it that far\n\nAnalysis: The Nationals are learning how fast things can change in a wild-card race\n\nAn MLB player suffered facial fractures after being hit.
