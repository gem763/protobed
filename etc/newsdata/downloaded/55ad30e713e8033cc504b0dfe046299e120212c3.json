It was a sunny, beautiful day and everyone was in a pretty good mood at kickoff time. Sure, the Jets eventually blew a 16-0 lead and lost by one point, but the crowd didn\u2019t take it all that badly.\n\nThis is partly because the Jets always blow a 16-point lead, so it wasn\u2019t as if the meltdown came as a big surprise. But another factor contributing to the crowd\u2019s relatively serene reaction to the defeat was the salubrious effect of tailgating.\n\nTailgating, a venerable American institution, does more than get people in the mood for the game. It gets people in the mood for a game that the home team might lose. Tailgating is so much fun, so convivial, so life-affirming that even if your team blows a 16-0 lead late in the second half, you don\u2019t feel like you wasted the day. Because at least you got to tailgate.\n\nWhy, then, is tailgating essentially limited to athletic events? Why don\u2019t people tailgate before they go to work? Work, like most football games, usually starts out OK but then hits a rough patch. You eventually realize that you\u2019re not going to accomplish everything you wanted to accomplish today, that things are not going to work out the way you hoped when you punched in. In the game of daily life, you\u2019re going to lose by a point. So you go home feeling glum, defeated, sad. Especially if you\u2019re a millennial.\n\n\u201c Lots of great businesses start out at tailgate parties. So do lots of great marriages. OK, maybe not lots. \u201d\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t feel that way if you\u2019d started the day by tailgating. You would have hung out with really good friends for a few hours before work started, had some delicious food, had a lot of belly laughs. And in many cases, you would have networked. Lots of great businesses start out at tailgate parties. So do lots of great marriages. Maybe not lots. But you get the idea.\n\nTailgating is also a terrific way to get your kid an internship with Morgan Stanley . Or to pitch a complete stranger a variable annuity. Or to unload an ATV you no longer need. Or to just sit back and discuss the meaning of life.\n\nYeah, sure, alcohol may contribute to the general mood of euphoria before, during and even after the game, but lots of tailgaters never touch a drink. I sure don\u2019t. And I love tailgating.\n\nConsider leisure activities where people don\u2019t tailgate. People attending the opera never look like they\u2019re enjoying themselves. This may be because the mezzo-soprano always get consumed by flames or betrayed by a perfidious lover and the heldentenor usually gets poisoned. But I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that opera buffs don\u2019t tailgate. If you tailgated before you went to see \u201cLa Boheme,\u201d you wouldn\u2019t care that Mimi ends up dead. Tailgating would ease the pain. Tailgating would make you forget who Mimi even is.\n\nTailgating could have a wonderful effect in many other settings. Exhibits of depressing paintings by Thomas Gainsborough, where the women all have blue skin and look like they\u2019ve missed their last 400 meals, would be easier to stomach if you tailgated before you went into the National Gallery. Rembrandt would be way more fun after three or four hours of tailgating. Ditto Hieronymus Bosch. You might need six hours of tailgating for that guy.\n\nIf you tailgated before you filed your taxes every April, the bitter pill would be a whole lot easier to swallow. Tailgating would really, really help out people going in for double-knee replacements. And what better way to deal with problems of self-loathing and inadequacy than to tailgate before you go in to see the shrink?\n\nHate going to the DMV to get your license renewed? Start tailgating at six in the morning. You won\u2019t feel a thing.\n\nOh yeah, one other thing. Always tailgate before you visit your in-laws.", "description": "Why is it only for sports?
