I think the president agrees with my assessment. We both agree. We see this as a political act, not a legal act 13 months to an election. There are serious allegations raised to bring them through the oversight process of Congress. Instead, immediately without speaking to the whistleblower, without seeing the whistleblower complaint, without interviewing anybody, they immediately call for an impeachment inquiry. It made it seem they were more interested in the act of the impeachment rather than finding the truth. I think the president, frankly, is overreacting, and the White House is overreacting by withholding testimony.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if it is this a threat to the president, Ruddy said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s a mortal threat to the presidency. He should treat it that way because it\u2019s not this issue about the Ukraine. You know, I think, you know, basketball they have the term, head faked. What \u2018I think we\u2019re seeing from the Democrats in Congress is a head fake. They\u2019re saying this is only about Ukraine. We\u2019re going to do it in 90 days. Why, then, do you open up six different congressional committees involved in the impeachment inquiry?\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Tuesday's broadcast of\u00a0CNN International's \"Amanpour,\" Newsmax Media CEO Christopher Ruddy said the Democrats'\u00a0impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/03/Christopher-Ruddy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
