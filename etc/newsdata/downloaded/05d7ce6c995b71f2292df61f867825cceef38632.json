Katie Hill Katherine (Katie) Lauren HillThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - ISIS leader dead; Congresswoman resigns Rep. Katie Hill resigns amid ethics probe Trump accuser E. Jean Carroll raises double standard over president, Rep. Hill MORE (D-Calif.) said she will fight \"revenge porn\" when she leaves Congress after websites published nude photos of her along with reports alleging she had improper relationships with members of her campaign and congressional staffs.\n\n\u201cAs I have before, I will stand up for those who can not stand up for themselves because there is one thing that I know for sure: I will not allow my experience to scare off other young women or girls from running for office,\u201d Hill said in a video released Monday, a day after the first-term congresswoman announced she would be resigning.\n\n\u201cFor the sake of all of us we cannot let that happen,\u201d she added. ADVERTISEMENT\n\nHill resigned amid the allegations and subsequent House ethics probe.\n\nShe denied having a relationship with her congressional staff member, which would be in violation of House rules, but admitted that she and her husband, whom she is divorcing, had a consensual, sexual relationship with a member of her campaign staff.\n\nRedState, a conservative news website which first reported the allegations, and the Daily Mail both published nude photos of Hill without her consent.\n\nHill\u2019s attorneys sent a cease and desist letter to the Daily Mail last week.\n\n\u201cI will fight to ensure that no one else has to live through what I just experienced,\u201d Hill said. \u201cSome people call this electronic assault, digital exploitation, others call it revenge porn. As the victim of it, I call it one of the worst things we can do to our sister and our daughters.\u201d\n\nHill did not elaborate in her statement on what measures she plans to take to fight revenge porn.\n\nHill blamed her husband, \u201cright wing media\u201d and Republican opponents on what she called a \u201csmear campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made this decision so that my supporters, my family, my staff and our community will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives,\u201d she said.\n\nHill said those involved in the \u201ccoordinated campaign\u201d that gave her husband a platform to perpetuate his abuse will be held accountable.\n\n\u201cBut I will not allow myself to be a distraction from the constitutional crisis were faced with and the critical work of my colleagues. So I have to take my personal life outside the halls of Congress ... I can not let this horrible smear campaign get in the way of this work,\u201d Hill said.\n\nHill flipped a GOP-held seat in 2018. A handful of Republicans had already launched campaigns ahead of Hill\u2019s resignation.\n\nCalifornia state Assemblywoman Christy Smith, a Democrat, announced her bid for Hill\u2019s seat Monday. In her announcement, Smith commended Hill for her service and her \u201cwillingness to put country first by stepping down from office.\u201d", "description": "Rep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/hillkatie_092419gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
