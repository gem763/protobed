In fact, as many as 96 percent of teachers, children and parents do not associate the name Mia with being clever. Surely that\u2019s not very good.\n\nPoor Jack is just misunderstood (Picture: Getty)\n\nJack \u2013 who came up top as worst behaved \u2013 also came on the bottom of the list when it came to intelligence, suggesting that people felt that the naughtiest children also weren\u2019t clever.\n\nAgain, yikes.\n\nChartered Clinical Psychologist and Scientist, Linda Blair, explains why these stereotypes exist: \u2018In today\u2019s information-rich world, we\u2019re exposed to far more data than we can deal with at any given moment. To help sort through this avalanche, we form stereotypes about what people will be like based on only a few easily obtained facts such as facial expression, body posture and a person\u2019s name.\n\n\u2018Rather than making judgments about others scientifically\u2013taking a dispassionate look at everyone called Noah or Isabella, for example\u2013we create our stereotypes using just the people we know, as well as those we think we know via social and other media.\n\nFrom there, something called \u2018confirmatory bias\u2019 means that the next time we see someone who matches that stereotype we affirm with ourselves that we\u2019re right, even if there\u2019s plenty of other information that shows we\u2019re wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018For popular names,\u2019 Dr Blair says, \u2018these stereotypes are likely to be at the forefront of our minds because most of us will already know or have read about someone called Jack, Harry or Emily\u2014and we\u2019re quite likely to meet more of them.\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, this is just the way of the world. We all know someone who\u2019s ruined their name for us by being mean or ignorant. What we should probably take from it, however, is that we really shouldn\u2019t be randomly judging children based on their names.\n\nBecause you never go full Hopkins.\n\nTop 5 Naughtiest Boys Names\n\nJack Harry Charlie Oliver George\n\nTop 5 Naughtiest Girls Names\n\nMia Ella Isabella Amelia Sophia\n\nTop 5 Best-Behaved Boys Names\n\nArthur Noah Oscar Muhammad Leo\n\nTop 5 Best-Behaved Girls Names\n\nIsla Ava Grace Olivia Emily\n\nMORE: A Scottish hotel has been named as the best wedding venue on Earth\n\nMORE: Cat owner saves paralysed kitten thrown out of moving car with \u00a311.99 baby oil\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Find out if your child's name is considered one of the 'naughtiest' according to new research.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-480965293_1571740061.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
