Russell, who thought he was fouled, jumped up after falling on the court and got into the face of referee James Williams.\n\nRussell was immediately handed one technical foul and hit with a second after he continued to chirp at Williams.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to come out of character like that,\u201d Russell told reporters after the game. \u201cI\u2019m not the type of dude to ever do that or act like I\u2019m that guy. For me to act like that it had to be something.\u201d\n\nRussell, who was acquired from the Brooklyn Nets after Kevin Durant left the Warriors in free agency, has struggled to adapt to his new team. In his first two games with the franchise, the 23-year-old guard has shot 9-for-26.\n\nAlong with Russell\u2019s offensive struggles, the Warriors opened the season with two crushing defeats. Golden State allowed 141 points in a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers in its season opener before Sunday\u2019s 120-92 loss to the Thunder.\n\nThe Warriors will play the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday night.", "description": "Oct. 27 (UPI) \u2014 Golden State Warriors guard D\u2019Angelo Russell was ejected for the first time in his NBA career during Sunday\u2019s blowout", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
