From online shopping to the modern battlefield, cyber is everywhere.\n\nWith all this cyber integration comes cyberthreats, both from criminals and other countries, and the need for cybersecurity across the private and government sectors has grown, commensurate with the threats.\n\nThat high demand for cybersecurity has created a global need for qualified personnel. There are estimated to be more than 300,000 cybersecurity job vacancies in the U.S. today, and there could be up to 3.5 million cybersecurity jobs that remain unfilled globally by 2021.\n\nCompetent people are essential for cybersecurity, and talent can take years to cultivate. Coders, developers, malware analysts, and other roles in the field are all in high demand.\n\nThe shortage is felt most acutely in the government cyber workforce. Federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense\u2014which houses both the National Security Agency and the U.S. Cyber Command\u2014have a hard time competing with the private sector for top talent.\n\nThe private sector offers high salaries, dynamic and casual work environments, and quicker onboarding processes\u2014all of which the government struggles to compete with.\n\nAccording to the commander of the U.S. Cyber Command, Gen. Paul Nakasone, the difference between the top cyber warriors and the rest can be substantial.\n\nHe said his best people are 10 or 20 times better than the rest. He also said \u201crecruiting, training, and retaining\u201d his top personnel were the greatest challenges he faces as the head of the Cyber Command.\n\nThe health of the cybersecurity workforce is essential for America\u2019s security and prosperity, and it\u2019s a strategic asset, as described by the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order seeks to strengthen that workforce by establishing new programs designed to create more opportunities for cyber personnel and flexibility to apply their skills in new jobs.\n\nA couple of examples are a new President\u2019s Cup Competition and a rotational program designed to enable federal employees to learn cybersecurity skills with temporary assignments.\n\nIt also encourages the adoption of the framework provided by the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education, a reference for creating and retaining cyber talent.\n\nIn addition, cybersecurity education will get more attention with the creation of the Presidential Cybersecurity Education Awards to recognize elementary and secondary school educators teaching cybersecurity content.\n\nOther measures\u2014including supporting alternative education programs, such as Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) and technology boot camps\u2014would be another way of expanding the cyber workforce, as The Heritage Foundation has recommended in a recent report.\n\nIf the United States is going to compete in the cyber domain, then it needs capable and talented cybersecurity professionals inside and outside of the government.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order is a step in the right direction and brings attention to a critical issue, but more remains to be done before this challenge is overcome.", "description": "President Donald Trump last week took a big step toward improving the cybersecurity of the nation.\n\nTrump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0aimed at increasing the size and strength of the cybersecurity workforce in the United States and addressing a critical need for protecting America in the cyber domain.", "authors": ["James Di Pane", "Research Associate", "Center For National Defense", "James Is A Research Associate In Heritage'S Center For National Defense."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-05/GettyImages-1145247153.jpg?itok=9nTVM7iP"}
