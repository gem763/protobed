Well Democrats\u2019 have a solution for that: \u201cWe shall impeach all da things!!\u201d Don\u2019t like a Supreme Court justice? Impeach him! Don\u2019t like the president? Impeach away. And if you\u2019re Congressman \u201cPresident\u201d Swalwell, I assume you nuke whatever is left.\n\nOf course there are no real grounds for impeachment\u2014just failed lies and hoaxes. But who cares? Clearly the Christine Blasey Ford and Russian collusion hit jobs failed miserably, but damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!\n\nLike a child with a box of matches, deranged Democrats seem to think they have their hands on a good idea. Their thinking goes something like this: \u201cIf we can\u2019t be in control, let\u2019s burn it all down, destroy norms, throw an epic political tantrum, hold the American people hostage! That\u2019ll show the irredeemable deplorables to question their betters!\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 sycophant propagandists in the corporate leftist media are barking and clapping away like circus seals, cheering them on. Both sets of deranged people appear perplexed, however, that outside of their bubble within the Acela corridor people in real America, as Politico chronicled, think the idea of impeachment is absurd. The corporate leftist media\u2019s reaction, from Chuck Todd\u2019s meltdown over the weekend to the Politico piece, is one of shock and disgust that people are not listening to their enlightened masters on this matter.\n\nEven worse (for them), polls show a majority of people actually agree with President Trump that the Bidens\u2019 behavior in the Ukraine\u2014and I would add, China\u2014should be investigated. Oh, the horror of it all! This is not how it\u2019s supposed to be: the peasants in the hinterlands are supposed to accept the absolute tripe being force fed to them; obediently and without question. In the minds of Democrats, the corporate leftist media, and of course the deep state actors, the world has been thrown off its axis and is spinning out of control. They must step in and save the \u201cworld.\u201d But what world? Whose world?\n\nWhat they will never understand, cannot understand, is that perhaps the real world\u2014not their twisted and warped one\u2014is being set right. Maybe, just maybe the American people have finally caught on to the games being played by certain people in the swamp: there is an axis of statist forces that truly think they should be running the country, elections be damned. These forces, Democrats, the corporate leftist media, and deep state actors believe that Americans should just accept their vision of open borders, one sided trade deals, man made global warming, infanticide, and trust the massive and ever growing administrative state to handle all the details.\n\nThese people all move within the same circles and share the same worldview, many proudly displaying the pieces of paper given to them upon their graduation from the indoctrination centers of higher learning. These pieces of paper, of course, demonstrate that they are the most intelligent, the \u201cmost best of the best,\u201d that they are the most enlightened among us. Or so we are told. What\u2019s really been really done over the years at these indoctrination centers is a collective stunting of mental acumen\u2014annihilating such basic skills as common sense (only indoctrinated idiots believe there are 63 genders) and deductive reasoning (only indoctrinated idiots think Trump is a Putin puppet). What\u2019s resulted is a world of idiocracy posing as an elite, one detached from reality and common sense.\n\nThat\u2019s what the last several years have been all about: a collision of worldview and value sets. The breathless rumors of Russian collusion, Kavanaugh gang rapes, none of it was really ever about THAT. It was all about how we deplorables view the world, a difference of policy, and about how America is to be governed\u2014what we do as a country both domestically and on the international stage. They are quite sure not just that we are wrong but that somehow our opinions are illegitimate. Those people lost an election and they couldn\u2019t stand it that an unwashed outsider walked into their holy of holies and called them fools, much to the delight of the Americans who elected him.\n\nIf you truly believe that the administrative state is the vehicle by which you shall achieve the progress of implementing a demented \u201cprogressive\u201d worldview, it is, essentially, your religion. We are fighting what amounts to a religious faith on the part of people who would impose it on us if they could.\n\nQuite frankly, the only surprise here is that they haven\u2019t completely lost it. Although, seriously: Who loses an election and then spins up fanciful fairy tales that somehow Trump colluded with Russia to win? Or that Kavanaugh ran a rape gang?\n\nYet now here we are with Democrats conducting an impeachment inquiry without making it a formal one, holding closed door hearings to collect information to conduct the fake impeachment while trotting out a second \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d who in all likelihood will turn out to be no different from the first: that is to say, not a whistleblower but a partisan covert operative working in concert with others to conduct a soft coup.\n\nIf you think that we\u2019ve reached a point of peak absurdity, wait until they roll out Whistleblower 23 who will breathlessly whisper that he or she has fourth hand knowledge that Trump has been caught colluding with the American people to lower unemployment rate to below 3.5 percent and stop illegal immigration and break apart the administrative state.\n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how all of this stops, how we return to normal, I will tell you what a friend told me: \u201cThere is no normal. There is only Clausewitz.\u201d There is only absolute and total political war on this axis we face until we beat them into an unconditional surrender. The Left wants it that way because they think they can win. They want no holds barred total political war. Since we can\u2019t escape it, I say we give it to them measure for measure.\n\nThe current iteration of the Democratic Party must be sent into the political wilderness. Delegitimized in the eyes of most Americans. The corporate leftist media (there\u2019s nothing mainstream about it) must be mocked relentlessly and shown to be the low information propagandists that they really are.\n\nTrump must put real teeth into the Presidential Intelligence Advisory Board and bring the intel community to heel. And in his second term, Trump must begin migrating the 800,000 non-essential government employees back into the private sector and start breaking apart the administrative state. He can start with the Department of Energy, break it apart into Interior, Commerce, and Defense and then literally blow the building up and build a Liberty Park over it.\n\nFor those who think there is some middle ground with the Left, there isn\u2019t. There\u2019s no negotiating with them until they sue for terms. Time to man up and fight: the future of our constitutional republic depends on it.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1127496090.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
