But with his penchant for demeaning and insulting opponents, President Donald Trump has drastically changed the norms of what is acceptable behavior for politicians.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, in particular, is known for his liberal use of the F-bomb, so much so that it even became the subject of an attack ad against him during his 2018 Senate run in Texas.\n\nIn recent weeks, O'Rourke has employed the four-letter-word in the context of discussing gun violence and what he perceives as dangerous inaction by the Republican Party.\n\nThis summer, Texas experienced a mass shooting that killed 21 people in El Paso \u2014 O'Rourke's hometown \u2014 on August 3 and another shooting spree in Odessa that killed eight people and injured two dozen others on August 31.\n\nIn the wake of the El Paso shooting \u2014 which is being prosecuted as an act of domestic terrorism \u2014 O'Rourke became frustrated when a reporter asked him if there was anything Trump could do to make the situation better.\n\n\"What do you think? You know the s--- he's been saying. He's been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. I don't know, like members of the press, what the f---? Hold on a second, you know, I ... it's these questions that you know the answers to,\" O'Rourke admonished.\n\nRead more: 'You know the s--- he's been saying': Beto O'Rourke criticized the media's coverage of Trump in the wake of a mass shooting in El Paso\n\nAnd after the Odessa shooting, O'Rourke again used the word on CNN, saying, \"We're averaging about 300 mass shootings a year. No other country comes close. So yes, this is f--- up.\"\n\nOther presidential candidates, including Sen. Cory Booker and Rep. Tim Ryan, have also described gun violence in America and the lack of a substantive Republican response as \"bulls---\" and told the GOP to \"get their s--- together on the issue.\"\n\nAnd former presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York found herself in hot water for saying \"if we're not helping people, we should go the f--- home\" back in the summer of 2017.\n\nO'Rourke argues that criticism of his swearing is a distraction from the real issues, saying, \"profanity is not the f-bomb. Profanity is a 17-month old baby being shot in the face,\" quoting a rabbi's rival tweet. \"Let's speak clearly, and bluntly, and use decisive language.\"", "description": "It used to be extremely unusual and taboo for politicians \u2014 much less presidential candidates \u2014 to openly curse, but many are swearing on the trail.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7804de2e22af17f931ae59-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
