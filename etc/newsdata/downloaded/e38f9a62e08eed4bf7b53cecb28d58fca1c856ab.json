The investigations led to the identification of 238 fraudulent migrant families, according to information obtained from ICE officials.\n\nICE officials began deploying additional resources to the southwest border during the peak of this year\u2019s crisis involving massive numbers of migrant families illegally crossing the border from Mexico, Breitbart Texas reported in April. The deployment followed the discovery of evidence indicating smugglers were exploiting U.S. immigration laws by creating fake families.\n\n\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Acting ICE Director Matthey T. Albence said in a phone interview with Breitbart Texas in May. \u201cBut, it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re surprised about, unfortunately. We\u2019ve been saying for several years that when we talk about the humanitarian crisis on the border, it\u2019s not just the number of family units and unaccompanied children that are coming to the border illegally, it\u2019s a fact that, based on the laws that Congress has failed to fix, they have created an industry the smuggling and rental of children.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese kids are being released and sent back across the border, whether it\u2019s to Mexico or to the Northern Triangle and being utilized again for this exact same purpose.\u201d the acting ICE director explained.\n\nAlbence discussed a specific case where 51-year-old Amilcar Guiza-Reyes obtained a fake birth certificate in order to establish a father-son relationship at the border. He arrived with a six-month-old child that agents would later determine he had no familial relations.\n\n\u201cCases like this demonstrate the real danger that exists to children in this disturbing new trend,\u201d HSI Acting Executive Associate Director Alysa Erichs said in a written statement. \u201cAnd while we have seen egregious cases of smugglers renting and recycling children, this case involving a six-month-old infant is a new low \u2013 and an unprecedented level of child endangerment.\u201d\n\nIn response to the border surge, ICE officials deployed 130 personnel to the southwest border.\n\n\u201cThe teams were chosen for their human smuggling and trafficking expertise and include criminal analysts, interpreters, document analysts, forensic interview specialists, and victim assistance specialists,\u201d ICE officials stated. \u201cICE is committed to ensure child safety and welfare and to decrease the number of minors being exploited to gain access into the United States.\u201d\n\nSince that time, ICE officials reported:\n\n238 fraudulent families identified;\n\n329 false documents seized that were used to support fraudulent claims;\n\nmore than 350 individuals federally prosecuted for various crimes, including human smuggling, making false statements, conspiracy, and illegal re-entry after removal; and\n\n50 individuals identified who have fraudulently claimed to be unaccompanied minors.\n\n\u201cThese children are being dangerously used as pawns by criminals to take advantage of loopholes in our immigration laws and avoid being detained by U.S. immigration authorities,\u201d Jack P. Staton, special agent in charge of HSI El Paso said in a written statement. \u201cHSI and Border Patrol will continue to protect children from being smuggled, as well as aggressively target, identify and stop criminal organizations from generating false documents and exploiting innocent children.\u201d\n\nEl Paso Sector Interim Chief Gloria I. Chavez added, \u201cThese are examples of the dark side of this humanitarian crisis that our Border Patrol and HSI agents are working tirelessly to identify. We will pursue the highest of judicial consequences for those who commit fraud and exploit innocent children.\u201d\n\nICE officials report the issue of \u201cfamily unit fraud\u201d has been on the increase since the spring of 2018.", "description": "HSI special agents say they identified more than 200 fraudulent migrant families apprehended at the Texas border.", "authors": ["Bob Price"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/us-customs-border-patrol-migrants-us-border-19-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
