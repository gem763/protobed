'And sometimes, when I drop a ball, I'm like, 'Darn it. I let my mama down.'\n\nHopkins and his mother Sabrina Greenlee spoke out in an interview with ESPN , describing their journey together from a life of poverty in South Carolina to the heights of NFL greatness\n\nHopkins is inseparable from his mother, who was blinded in an acid attack in 2002\n\nHopkins grew up near Central, South Carolina, and his childhood was marked by tragedy.\n\nWhen he was just a baby, his father Steve died in a car wreck while free on bond for drug trafficking charges.\n\nGreenlee was only 23 when Steve died.\n\n'I was lost, and I didn't really know how to take care of the kids,' she told the outlet. 'Making ends meet was tough because I'd always depended on guys to do that.'\n\nWhen the children were young, Greenlee held down two jobs, working at an automotive plant during the day and as an exotic dancer at night.\n\nA survivor of domestic abuse, Greenlee continued to be drawn to the wrong kind of men.\n\nHopkins is seen on the porch of his childhood home in South Carolina. His early life was marred by tragedy, first the death of his father in a car crash, and then the attack on his mother\n\nOn the morning of July 20, 2002, Greenlee woke up and saw that her car was missing from their driveway.\n\nShe quickly surmised that a man she had been dating for a few months had borrowed it without asking, and rushed over to the place he was staying to retrieve it.\n\nWhen she arrived, he apologized profusely. Then a woman, whom Greenlee didn't recognized, stormed out of the house in a jealous rage, toting a bucket filled with bleach mixed with lye.\n\nThe jealous woman hurled the bucket's contents in Greenlee's face before she knew what was happening.\n\nAcid attacker Savannah Carlita Grant, 41, is serving a 20 year prison sentence\n\n'And as I'm lying there, the first thing I'm thinking is, \"Why would someone pour warm water on my face?'' she says. 'But a couple of seconds later, I realized it wasn't warm water, because my skin is literally falling off my face, my neck, my chest and my back.'\n\nGreenlee was airlifted to a burn center in Augusta, Georgia, where she lay in a medically induced coma for several weeks, as doctors grafted skin from her chest and back onto her face. When she finally emerged from the coma, her life was changed forever.\n\nHer attacker, Savannah Carlita Grant, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for assault and battery with intent to kill. The boyfriend was not charged.\n\nTen-year-old Hopkins was devastated by the attack. 'I was in shock that somebody could look like that,' he told ESPN. 'It was really scary - and to think that's my mom, she's gonna be like that the rest of her life. I was hoping that it was a dream.'\n\nGreenlee was blinded in the attack, and unable to return to work at the plant or dancing. A struggling single mother, she turned to selling drugs to make ends meet.\n\n'I thought I was doing what I needed to do,' she recalled. 'In hindsight, it was the worst thing I could've done, when you have kids that are just trying to go to sleep and get up in the mornings to go to school ... but I was just seeing it as a way to make money.'\n\nDeAndre Hopkins is seen with mother Sabrina Greenlee after he was drafted by the Houston Texans in 2013\n\nGreenlee is seen in her regular seats for all Texans home game, in the end-zone where Hopkins can hand her the ball if he catches a touchdown\n\nSabrina Greenlee is seen cheering on her son at the Falcons-Texans game in Week 5\n\nMeanwhile, Hopkins began to excel at pee wee league football, with hands that seemed oversized for his body.\n\nAs he became a top receiver in high school, his mother desperately wanted to go to his games, but feared leaving the house in shame over her scars.\n\nOver and over, Hopkins begged her to come to a game, and finally she relented, allowing family members to help her attend.\n\n'I was able to cope with being blind and the scars and the ridicule,' she told ESPN. 'And I think it gave me the courage to eventually find myself.'\n\nAs Hopkins went on to become a star receiver at nearby Clemson, and become a first-round pick in the 2013 NFL draft, his mother shared in his glory.\n\nHopkins of the Houston Texans runs after being called down during a game against the Carolina Panthers at NRG Stadium on September 29, 2019 in Houston, Texas\n\nHouston Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins before an NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers last month\n\nToday, she attends every one of Hopkins' home games.\n\n'I visualize everything that he does,' she said. 'The dreads, the body movement.'\n\nWhenever Hopkins catches a touchdown in her end-zone, she beams with pride as he hands her the ball on national television, a symbol of their unbreakable bond.\n\n'I've not always been your typical role-model mother, and he still respects me enough to let everybody see him give me that ball,' she says. 'That ball symbolizes so much more than people ever could understand.'", "description": "Hopkins and his mother Sabrina Greenlee spoke out in an interview with ESPN, describing their journey together from a life of poverty in South Carolina to the heights of NFL greatness.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/20/19800668-0-image-a-24_1571253546391.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
