We don't protect our own borders... In 15 minutes we could solve the problem,\" he told the crowd.\n\n\"As a law enforcement officer for many decades, Pete, I'm equally as frustrated as the president,\" said Morgan. \"And, the American people should be worried as well.\"\n\nAdding: \"This is yet another example of judicial activism of a lower court that's absolutely impeding our ability as a law enforcement agency to safeguard this country against this humanitarian crisis and national security crisis. We're beyond frustrated.\"\n\n\"I have full confidence we're ultimately going to prevail,\" he said. \"The wall is not going to stop being built. It's going to continue.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlso on Friday, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan stepped down from his post.\n\n\"Kevin now, after many years in Government, wants to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector,\" the president tweeted. \"Congratulations Kevin, on a job well done!\"\n\nMorgan said he was sure it was a \"hard decision\" for the secretary, but that \"we need to stay focused\" because border-apprehension numbers are still at \"crisis levels.\"\n\n\"We still have a heck of a lot of work to do to safeguard this country, so that's our focus,\" he concluded.\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw and Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report.", "description": "The Trump administration and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) are going to ask for an appeal after a federal judge ruled Friday that President Trump's\u00a0national emergency proclamation at the border is unlawful, acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan said Saturday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/mark-morgan-FOX.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
