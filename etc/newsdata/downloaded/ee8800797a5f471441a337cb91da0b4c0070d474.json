REUTERS/Daniel Tapia\n\nFrom the highland capital Quito to the coastal city of Guayaquil, many bus and taxi services halted service on Thursday and Friday, while demonstrators blocked roads and clashed with police. Despite the transport unions\u2019 announcement, other social movements vowed to stay in the streets.\n\nMoreno has set oil producer Ecuador on a centrist path after years of leftist rule under Rafael Correa and is implementing a belt-tightening fiscal package to conform with a $4.2 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) deal.\n\nBut his elimination of the decades-old fuel subsidies has incensed many Ecuadoreans and brought violent protests back to a nation with a history of political volatility.\n\nIn Quito, students lobbed stones at ranks of riot police and armoured vehicles during the worst unrest for years in the country of 17 million people. Security forces used tear gas to prevent hundreds of protesters from reaching the white-walled presidential palace in the city\u2019s colonial centre.\n\nAt a news conference on Friday evening, the transport unions\u2019 spokesman Abel Gomez said they had expressed their disagreement and handed a list of demands to the government. \u201cTherefore today, for our side, our measures end,\u201d he said.\n\nBut leaders for indigenous groups, students and other unions, which had joined the protests, told reporters in Quito earlier on Friday that they would continue and called for a nationwide strike on Oct. 9.\n\n\u201cNot even jail will stop the Ecuadorean people\u2019s struggle,\u201d said Nelson Erazo, head of the Popular Front, an organization that groups together unions and social movements. \u201cThese will be days of unrest.\u201d\n\nMoreno\u2019s popularity has sunk to below 30% compared with above 70% after his 2017 election, but his political position appears firm given support from the business elite, military loyalty, and the lack of a strong opposition.\n\nHowever, Ecuadoreans are mindful that protests toppled three presidents during economic turmoil in the decade before Correa took power in 2007.\n\nSTATE OF EMERGENCY\n\nMoreno, a 66-year-old who uses a wheelchair after a 1998 shooting during a robbery left him paraplegic, has declared a 60-day state of emergency across Ecuador.\n\nBy Friday evening, 368 people had been arrested, mainly in Quito and Guayaquil, the Interior Ministry said. Looting was reported in Guayaquil.\n\nAuthorities say 59 police officers have been hurt, a dozen police cars destroyed, and a local government building attacked.\n\nTruck drivers\u2019 leader Luis Vizcaino called for dialogue with the government. \u201cAll Ecuador\u2019s transport sectors are in crisis. ... We have to reach a halfway measure,\u201d he said. Taxi union leader Jorge Calderon was among those detained.\n\nDiesel prices have risen from $1.03 to $2.30 per gallon, while gasoline went from $1.85 to $2.39.\n\nMoreno said he was open to talks but there was no possibility of restoring fuel subsidies that he said had damaged the economy and cost state coffers $60 billion over the years.\n\n\u201cThere will be mechanisms to ease the impact on some sectors,\u201d he said. \u201cBut listen clearly: I am not going to change the measure, the subsidy is finished, no more loafing.\u201d\n\nFOOD PRICES RISE\n\nEcuador hopes to save about $1.5 billion a year from ending fuel subsidies. Along with tax reforms, the government would benefit by about $2.27 billion.\n\nThe government has also been laying off some state workers. It wants to reduce the fiscal deficit from an estimated $3.6 billion this year to under $1 billion in 2020.\n\nEcuador also plans to leave the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 2020 to pump more oil and raise revenue.\n\nNational debt grew under Correa, who endorsed Moreno in 2017 but now calls him a \u201ctraitor.\u201d\n\nMoreno\u2019s government has improved relations with the West and reached its three-year, $4.2 billion loan deal with the IMF in February, dependent on \u201cstructural measures\u201d including raising tax revenue and bolstering central bank independence.\n\nThe deal allowed Ecuador to receive an immediate disbursement of $652 million and paved the way for an additional $6 billion in loans from other multilateral institutions.\n\nBut scepticism of the IMF runs strong throughout Latin America, where many blame its conditions for personal hardships.", "description": "Ecuador's transport unions on Friday called off protests against the scrapping of fuel subsidies by President Lenin Moreno after two days of unrest that halted transport nationwide and resulted in almost 370 arrests.", "authors": ["Alexandra Valencia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437085659&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9319F", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
