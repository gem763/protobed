The weekend aggression comes after Mr. Trump called off an airstrike in June to retaliate for the shooting down of a $130 million U.S. surveillance drone. On Twitter on Tuesday, Senator Lindsey Graham said the weekend attacks show that Iran sees Mr. Trump\u2019s cancellation of the strike as \u201ca sign of weakness.\u201d\n\nThe President shot back that it was a sign of strength that \u201csome people just don\u2019t understand.\u201d But the facts are on Mr. Graham\u2019s side. Mr. Trump has loudly made clear he is reluctant to pursue the military option, and in the Middle East adversaries respect only strength. The U.S. and Saudis have shown they can\u2019t protect the oil fields, and the next attack may hit the United Arab Emirates or Kuwait\u2026\n\nMr. Trump wants to reduce every foreign controversy to a negotiation with some head of state, and the world\u2019s bad actors are figuring that out. Tehran has a clear policy to become the dominant power in the Middle East, and its actions\u2014including aggression to destabilize its Arab neighbors\u2014support that policy. Mr. Trump had better prepare for more Iranian trouble.", "description": "", "authors": ["Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": ""}
