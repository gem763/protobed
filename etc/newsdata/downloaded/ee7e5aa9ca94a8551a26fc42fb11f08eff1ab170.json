Much like his rival, Gantz faces a paralyzed political system with a narrow pathway to form a stable coalition in the next month before his deadline is up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re no closer to a government. It\u2019s just stuck,\u201d said Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli political analyst. \u201cThe parties don\u2019t want to cooperate with one another with the level of compromise you need to have in a democratic system.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead, Israelis could end up returning to the polls in early 2020 for the third time in less than a year. But while the leader of Israel\u2019s next government remains undetermined, one thing is abundantly clear: the days of Bibi as Israel\u2019s indispensable leader are over.\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens from this point forward, both Netanyahu's unchallenged reign and a public perception of his necessity have been undermined,\u201d said Brent Sasley, a University of Texas professor who studies Israeli politics.\n\n\n\nRead: Israel\u2019s Arab Parties Want Netanyahu Gone So Bad that They\u2019ve Endorsed a General Who Bombed Gaza\n\nNow it\u2019s Gantz turn. But he\u2019ll also struggle to get to 61 seats, and has refused to partner with Netanyahu. Both leaders are short on political partners, who are either too religious, in the case of Gantz, or too far to the left, in the case of Netanyahu. Both Gantz and Netanyahu also have problems joining together with the Joint List, a majority-Palestinian coalition whose views on Zionism and Israel\u2019s occupation are anathema to the two security hawks.\n\nBut the major obstacle for a grand coalition is Netanyahu\u2019s looming indictments for alleged crimes of bribery and breach of trust. Gantz has repeatedly pledged not to sit with a prime minister facing a criminal trial, and he rejected a plan from the Israeli president to alternate with Netanyahu in the prime minister\u2019s seat. Gantz also bristled at Netanyahu\u2019s insistence that he negotiate with a fully-formed right-wing political alliance, rather than just with Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party.\n\nFacing such obstacles, Gantz will likely need a major shift in Israeli politics, like Likud jettisoning Netanyahu, to realize his goals. That might happen if Netanyahu is hit with criminal charges.\n\n\u201cIf Netanyahu is indicted for bribery, then Blue and White hopes they can rally public opinion, including Netanyahu\u2019s voters, to force a change of leadership in Likud,\u201d said Ofer Zalzberg, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group.\n\nBut there\u2019s no certainty as to when, and if, Netanyahu will be indicted.\n\nThere is another option. Gantz could form a minority government, a coalition that doesn\u2019t have 61 seats but does garner enough votes to block a future no-confidence motion to bring down his government. To do that, he would need to make concessions to get the support of the Joint List, the majority-Palestinian coalition that won 13 Knesset seats in the last election. The Joint List wants more investment in Palestinian cities within Israel and a commitment to equality.\n\n\u201cEventually someone will have to break a promise\u201d\n\nGantz, however, has shown no interest in those concessions, and, in any case, he\u2019d need another party in addition to the Joint List to form a minority coalition. The most likely prospect would be Avigdor Lieberman\u2019s Israel Is Our Home party, which won eight seats. But Lieberman is a far-right secular nationalist who loathes the Joint List, making it difficult for that coalition to coalesce.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the option of Gantz\u2019s party joining with an ultra-Orthodox party. But he\u2019s derided these parties in the past as people who \u201cextort\u201d Israel\u2019s political class to get money for their communities in exchange for political backing.\n\n\u201cEventually someone will have to break a promise,\u201d said Scheindlin.\n\nIf the political deadlock remains after 28 days, members of the Knesset would get a shot at choosing an alternative candidate for prime minister who could win 61 votes, or if that also fails, risk returning Israelis to the polls for yet another election early next year.\n\n\u201cThat would be very bad news for stability, for governance, for managing the affairs of the state,\u201d said Yohanan Plesner, a former Knesset member and president of the Israel Democracy Institute. \u201cAnd it\u2019s likely to produce an outcome similar to the current outcome.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAlex Kane is a New York-based freelance journalist who writes on Israel/Palestine and civil liberties issues.\n\nCover: Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu (C) speaks during Likud party faction meeting, ahead of the swearing-in of the 22nd Israel's parliament (Knesset).
