The average balance requirement on interest checking accounts \u2014 \u201ca form of stealth fee increase,\u201d said McBride \u2014 also increased 13% over last year.\n\nOn the bright side, Bankrate found that about 99% of non-interest checking accounts were by default free or had the potential to be free. Some 42% were free, McBride said, while another 43% would waive the monthly fee based on just direct deposit.\n\nBankrate surveyed 10 banks and thrifts each in 25 large U.S. markets. The survey also included interest and non-interest accounts from 244 institutions that offer checking accounts, as well as 238 interest and 237 non-interest accounts.\n\nWhile the pace of ATM, overdraft and monthly account fee increases this year was modest relative to years past, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen the biggest increases in years where interest rates were really low and banks\u2019 interest margins were squeezed,\u201d McBride said.\n\n\u201cBe on the lookout over the course of the next 12 months,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re likely to see fees go up at a faster pace, because the Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates and bank margins are under pressure once again.\u201d", "description": "The average overdraft fee for checking accounts has also increased.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS317_boa_ZG_20190930130736.jpg"}
