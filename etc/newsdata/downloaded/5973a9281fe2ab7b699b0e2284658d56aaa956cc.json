We both previously had a very liberal attitude towards monogamy.\n\n'We thought being in open relationships were the way to find happiness because life is too short to spend all your life with one partner.\n\n'But that all changed when I met Jack. I wanted to spend the rest of life with him and that meant ditching the extra-marital dating.'\n\nEntrepreneur Thea Thorpe, 30, is tying the knot with Jack Logan-Beddings, 36, both from Nottingham, next summer after they used the site to cheat on their previous partners\n\n'I appreciate this is not your conventional love story but they do say that love finds a way - and it certainly has with Jack and I.'\n\nJack said: 'If you had told me that I would meet the woman of my dreams on a cheating site, I never would have believed you.\n\n'But after my first date with Thea I knew that I never wanted to share her with anyone else. I wanted us both to build a future together as a normal man and wife.'\n\nThea and Jack first started dating a year ago when she was in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend and Jack was married to his first wife.\n\nThea and Jack first started dating a year ago when she was in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend and Jack (pictured) was married to his first wife\n\nThea admits that she used the site to have several affairs - and thought she was living the perfect life - with lots of sex but the stability of having a steady partner back at home\n\nThea said: 'We were both in relationships where we had permission to cheat. I was dating several men on a casual basis and was using lots of dating sites.\n\n'A specialist extra-marital dating site suited me because the kind of people you meet are in open relationships, too.\n\n'It makes things less complicated and you can just concentrate on having some fun together.\n\n'I had several affairs in this way and thought that I was living the perfect life - with lots of sex but the stability of having a steady partner back at home.\n\n'For a long time I convinced myself that this is what I really wanted and that I was enjoying the best of both worlds.\n\nThea (right) said once she met Jack she knew she had something much more meaningful and couldn't handle the idea of him sleeping with another woman\n\n'I would get the giddy excitement you get when you meet a new partner and then, when it all went a bit stale after a few dates, I could just move on without any complications.\n\n'Then I met Jack and all that changed. He made me realise that my long-term relationship was a sham and that the flings I was having on the side were just that - meaningless flings.\n\n'With Jack, I had something much more meaningful and I knew I couldn't handle the idea of him sleeping with another woman.\n\nJack admits that he knew straight away with Thea that he was living a lie and that he'd met his life partner\n\n'Within a few dates, we had both left our partners and cancelled our subscription to IllicitEncounters.com. We have remained faithful to each other ever since and cannot wait to tie the knot next year.'\n\nLike Thea, Jack had been unfaithful several times and he is still married to his first wife. He will only tie the knot with Thea when his divorce comes through.\n\nHe said: 'I knew straight away with Thea that I was living a lie and that I had met my life partner.\n\n'Obviously it was slightly more complicated for me because I was married to my wife but we split shortly after that first date with Thea.\n\nThe couple admit that within a few dates, they had both left their partners and cancelled their subscription to IllicitEncounters.com\n\nJack insists that he trusts Thea (pictured) completely and they have been completely faithful since falling in love\n\n'I had had other flings with women I had met on dating sites before I met Thea. It was fun at first but it does get a bit tiring moving from one relationship to the next when you are still married.\n\n'I didn't really connect with anyone until I met Thea and then love hit me like a thunderbolt.'\n\nJack insists that he trusts Thea completely and they have been completely faithful since falling in love.\n\n'We cannot bear to be apart so I know where Thea is 24/7 - we have total trust and cannot wait to build a future together,' he said.\n\nThea said: 'Just because we have both cheated before doesn't mean will do it again. It's different with Jack.'\n\nJack and Thea are the first couple, who met on site to go public with their wedding plans\n\nTo ensure that they both don't cheat in the future, they are working with relationship expert Louise Van Der Velde, who runs courses teaching couples how to have better relationships.\n\nIllicitEncounters.com spokeswoman Jessica Leoni said: 'We are delighted that Thea and Jack are tying the knot after meeting on the site.\n\n'Around 10 per cent of the people who use the site do find love in this way while the vast majority happily continue to cheat with like-minded people.'\n\nAround one million people have registered with IllicitEncounters.com since the site was first started 16 years ago. Jack and Thea are the first couple from the site to go public with their wedding plans.", "description": "Entrepreneur Thea Thorpe, 30, is tying the knot with Jack Logan-Beddings, 36, both from Nottingham, next summer after they used the site to cheat on their previous partners.", "authors": ["Sarah Finley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/09/19480672-0-image-a-17_1570608364516.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
