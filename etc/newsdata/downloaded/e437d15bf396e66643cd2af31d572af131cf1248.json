The black, white, yellow and red are found on the similarly sized iPhone XR which launched last year, but the final two are brand new: green and purple.\n\nThe iPhone 11 can be charged wirelessly using a compatible wireless charging pad \u2013 all the cases here allow wireless charging to happen without removing the case.\n\nWith such bright phones, the prospect of a case that shows them off is even more appealing than usual.\n\nThere are different kinds of cases, from sleeves which you slide off when the phone rings to folio wallets that cover the front and back of your device or store your credit cards.\n\nWhichever you like, there are options to choose from here, designed to protect your iPhone 11 and make it look its best.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

They are long-lasting, too. The classic case is a simple sleeve available in more than 20 colours. Then there are choices of smooth or granulated leather finishes, not to mention premium leather options. There are lots of other case options, from sleeves with a pull tab to folios to cases designed to fit on your belt. In other words, you\u2019re likely to find something you like. Hard to resist.\n\nBuy now\n\nApple iPhone 11 clear case: \u00a345, Apple\n\nWhere some cases are matte or slightly hard to see through, this one is completely clear. It\u2019s a gloss-finish material that feels sumptuous and is a good fit in the hand. It has scratch-resistance built in and is soft enough to feel comfortable but solid enough to reassure you that it\u2019s strong. Apple says it\u2019s designed so it won\u2019t yellow over time. The front edges creep over the front to protect the display. There\u2019s no extra protection material in this case but it is enough to keep your iPhone safe. But it\u2019s the feel of the case that really stands out.\n\nBuy now\n\nMous Limitless 3.0: \u00a334.99, Mous\u200b\n\nBritish company Mous has its own way to keep your phone safe thanks to a material called \u201cairoshock\u201d which acts as a shock absorber when the phone is dropped, even from a huge height. There are different back covers to choose from, including leather, walnut and bamboo. The case features thoughtful details like a slot inside to hold a spare sim card and another slot the perfect size for that sim tray tool you use when you get your phone and lose the day after.\n\nPre-order now\n\nPeel super thin case: \u00a323, Peel\n\nThis is as thin as a phone case can get. It feels almost as though you\u2019re using it without a case at all. It doesn\u2019t offer the same protection as some here because there\u2019s nothing on the front of the phone at all. So, choose a screen protector to go with this case. The real joy of this Peel case is the variety of colours it comes in, most are translucent so the Apple logo shines through. There are also a couple of opaque versions which look great, especially jet white which is a glossy, shiny case that is just gorgeous.\n\nBuy now\n\nGear4 crystal palace: \u00a329.99, Zagg\n\nThe Gear4 cases from Zagg work well because they have a clever substance called D3O inside which is thin and almost invisible but capable of great shock protection. The crystal palace case is certified to protect the phone against a drop of four metres, for instance. The case is also made from polycarbonate, as used in bullet-proof glass, though that\u2019s neither the purpose nor expectation here. Available in a range of transparent finishes including neon pink, yellow and iridescent.\n\nBuy now\n\nNodus access case III: \u00a339.99, Nodus\n\nThe clever thing about Nodus cases is that they are slimmer and lighter than many. That\u2019s because instead of an internal cradle to hold the phone tightly, Nodus uses a series of micro-suction cups which take up no space at all. The Nodus case comes in a series of colours and has a front pocket for cards and cash. The leather is attractive and tactile.\n\nPre-order now\n\nMujjo full leather wallet case: \u00a344.24, Mujjo\n\nMujjo uses appealingly thick leather for its cases and includes a useful pocket for credit cards on the back of the phone. The unusual design is attractive and effective. This new model for the iPhone 11 comes in several colours including an eye-catching Monaco blue and fetching alpine green (coming in October) as well as black which is available now.\n\nBuy now\n\nCasetify impact: \u00a330, Casetify\n\nFor sheer variety, Casetify can\u2019t be beaten. It has so many cases to choose from it\u2019s almost dizzying with everything from plain colours to detailed images or cute patterns. All have the Casetify logo wrapping round the camera slot. There is decent shock protection (a drop from up to 10 feet doesn\u2019t worry it) thanks to being built from a solid plastic with flexible and solid reinforced corners.\n\nBuy now\n\nMoshi altra: \u00a344.95, Moshi\n\nThe Moshi smartphone case range is growing and the altra is one of the most attractive. It has a detachable wrist strap so you can be sure you won\u2019t drop it even if your hands are full. The textured coating is water repellent, and a raised edge protects the display when the phone is face down. Like the others here, Moshi\u2019s case allows wireless charging. This is a highly style-conscious case from a company known for its excellent design.\n\nAvailable soon\n\nThe verdict: iPhone 11 and 11 Plus cases\n\nFor slimness, Peel is outstanding, for build quality, design and longevity, Lucrin is hard to beat and for solid protection, Mous is the go-to brand. Additionally, because the colourful finishes on the iPhone 11 are so attractive, you may want to opt for a transparent case to show off your chosen shade. Apple\u2019s own case looks and feels tremendous.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
