The only thing I knew in the world was that I wanted to be a country singer. I just graduated high school and two weeks later, I was sitting in Nashville.'\n\n'My first job was painting a house for Mae Boren Axton, whose son was Hoyt Axton, living in her driveway on his tour bus. He invited me onto his bus one day, and he sang me that song.'\n\n'Little did I know as a 17-year-old kid from Ada, Oklahoma, came there, didn't know what I was gonna do, and within no time, I had found what would go on to be possibly my signature song.'\n\n'And now, here, all these years later, that's the song that you chose to sing and that song was timeless. You did a great job,' Blake said.\n\nNailed it: Zach performed Blake's 2002 song bringing back memories for the country star\n\n'That was really sweet,' said his fellow judge Kelly Clarkson, 37, who usually sparred with him.\n\n'You melted my heart,' judge John Legend, 40, agreed, before Zach chose Blake to be his coach.\n\n'Blake lies a lot on this show, and it's like, Blake is human. He's actually a decent person sometimes,' the EGOT winner joked.\n\nReally sweet: Kelly Clarkson was touched by Blake sharing his personal story and said it was 'really sweet'\n\n'It's nerve-wracking to me when an artist sings my song during the blind auditions,' said Blake.

'I really love that song. I'm a huge fan of Blake Shelton. I think he's actually my favorite singer in the whole world.'\n\nMoving forward: Zach listened as Gwen Stefani tried to lure him onto her team, but he chose her boyfriend Blake to be his coach\n\n'It's fun to be in a competition with Blake, because It's not who we are at home at all,' Gwen noted afterward, laughing. 'Being on this show, it brings it out.'\n\n'My only problem was the song selection,' John cracked, explaining why he hadn't turned. 'Your voice deserves so much better.'\n\n'Finally the knives really come out,' Blake retorted.\n\nDecent person: John Legend joked that Blake lies a lot on the show\n\nBlake also did well later to nab a contestant who earned a four-chair turn from the judges.\n\nRicky Duran, 29, performed a haunting rendition of Leon Bridges' River, which he said was about 'coming out of the darkness into the light.'\n\nBack home in Austin, Texas, Ricky performed music five nights a week, and was 'living the dream his parents had' for him, explaining that they'd bought him a guitar at age six.\n\nFour chairs: Ricky Duran got all four judges to turn their chairs\n\nHe had put his life on hold for the past few years while his mother was sick with an undisclosed illness, and she passed away in 2018, following his father's death by suicide when he was 22.\n\nRicky hadn't understood how stressed-out his dad had been, he said, but he wished he could tell him that he only wanted him to be happy and follow his dreams.\n\n'I feel like they're the reason I have this opportunity,' Ricky said.

'I'd love to take you to it, if you want to go.'\n\nRiver property: Blake told Ricky that his property in Oklahoma has a river\n\n'That was a performance that clearly had us all from the beginning, and as these chairs turned around, it just gave you even more confidence, like, ''Man, I'm gonna let it fly'',' he continued.\n\n'Your tone is great\u2014you have the aggressiveness when you need to have it, and great stage presence. I'd love to be your coach, dude,' Blake added.\n\n'I think I'd like to go to that river,' Ricky said, picking Blake.\n\nThe judges: Blake, John, Gwen and Kelly evaluated the talent as the blind auditions continued\n\n'Just because he's got a river doesn't mean he's gonna be a good choice for you,' John cracked to the cameras.
