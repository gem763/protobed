The effort to secure that meeting began the same day the prosecutor's firing was announced.\n\nIn addition, Burisma\u2019s American team offered to introduce Ukrainian prosecutors to Obama administration officials to make amends, according to that memo and the American legal team\u2019s internal emails.\n\nThe memos raise troubling questions:\n\n1.) If the Ukraine prosecutor\u2019s firing involved only his alleged corruption and ineptitude, why did Burisma's American legal team refer to those allegations as \u201cfalse information?\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n2.) If the firing had nothing to do with the Burisma case, as Biden has adamantly claimed, why would Burisma\u2019s American lawyers contact the replacement prosecutor within hours of the termination and urgently seek a meeting in Ukraine to discuss the case?\n\nUkrainian prosecutors say they have tried to get this information to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) since the summer of 2018, fearing it might be evidence of possible violations of U.S. ethics laws. First, they hired a former federal prosecutor to bring the information to the U.S. attorney in New York, who, they say, showed no interest. Then, the Ukrainians reached out to President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiHarris calls for NY bar association probe into Giuliani Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Huntington Ingalls Industries \u2014 Intel chief defends handling of whistleblower complaint | Complaint alleged attempt to cover-up Ukraine call | US to send 200 troops to Saudi Arabia | Senate confirms Joint Chiefs No. 2 Harris asks watchdog to investigate if State Dept. officials helped Giuliani MORE.\n\nUkraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, told Trump in July that he plans to launch his own wide-ranging investigation into what happened with the Bidens and Burisma.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m knowledgeable about the situation,\u201d Zelensky told Trump, asking the American president to forward any evidence he might know about. \"The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case.\u201d\n\nBiden has faced scrutiny since December 2015, when the New York Times published a story noting that Burisma hired Hunter Biden just weeks after the vice president was asked by President Obama to oversee U.S.-Ukraine relations. That story also alerted Biden\u2019s office that Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin had an active investigation of Burisma and its founder.\n\nDocuments I obtained this year detail an effort to change the narrative after the Times story about Hunter Biden, with the help of the Obama State Department.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s American business partner in Burisma, Devon Archer, texted a colleague two days after the Times story about a strategy to counter the \u201cnew wave of scrutiny\u201d and stated that he and Hunter Biden had just met at the State Department. The text suggested there was about to be a new \u201cUSAID project the embassy is announcing with us\u201d and that it was \u201cperfect for us to move forward now with momentum.\u201d\n\nI have sued the State Department for any records related to that meeting. The reason is simple: There is both a public interest and an ethics question to knowing if Hunter Biden and his team sought State\u2019s assistance while his father was vice president.\n\nThe controversy ignited anew earlier this year when I disclosed that Joe Biden admitted during a 2018 videotaped speech that, as vice president in March 2016, he threatened to cancel $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees, to pressure Ukraine\u2019s then-President Petro Poroshenko to fire Shokin.\n\nAt the time, Shokin\u2019s office was investigating Burisma. Shokin told me he was making plans to question Hunter Biden about $3 million in fees that Biden and his partner, Archer, collected from Burisma through their American firm. Documents seized by the FBI in an unrelated case confirm the payments, which in many months totaled more than $166,000.\n\nSome media outlets have reported that, at the time Joe Biden forced the firing in March 2016, there were no open investigations. Those reports are wrong. A British-based investigation of Burisma's owner was closed down in early 2015 on a technicality when a deadline for documents was not met. But the Ukraine Prosecutor General's office still had two open inquiries in March 2016, according to the official case file provided me. One of those cases involved taxes; the other, allegations of corruption. Burisma announced the cases against it were not closed and settled until January 2017.\n\nAfter I first reported it in a column, the New York Times and ABC News published similar stories confirming my reporting.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJoe Biden has since responded that he forced Shokin\u2019s firing over concerns about corruption and ineptitude, which he claims were widely shared by Western allies, and that it had nothing to do with the Burisma investigation.\n\nSome of the new documents I obtained call that claim into question.\n\nIn a newly sworn affidavit prepared for a European court, Shokin testified that when he was fired in March 2016, he was told the reason was that Biden was unhappy about the Burisma investigation. \u201cThe truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings, a natural gas firm active in Ukraine and Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, was a member of the Board of Directors,\u201d Shokin testified.\n\n\u201cOn several occasions President Poroshenko asked me to have a look at the case against Burisma and consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of this company but I refused to close this investigation,\u201d Shokin added.\n\nShokin certainly would have reason to hold a grudge over his firing. But his account is supported by documents from Burisma\u2019s legal team in America, which appeared to be moving into Ukraine with intensity as Biden\u2019s effort to fire Shokin picked up steam.\n\nBurisma\u2019s own accounting records show that it paid tens of thousands of dollars while Hunter Biden served on the board of an American lobbying and public relations firm, Blue Star Strategies, run by Sally Painter and Karen Tramontano, who both served in President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonOn The Money: Senate confirms Scalia as Labor chief | Bill with B in wall funding advanced over Democrats' objections | Lawyers reach deal to delay enforcement of NY tax return subpoena Lawyers reach deal to delay enforcement of NY tax return subpoena Solomon: These once-secret memos cast doubt on Joe Biden's Ukraine story MORE\u2019s administration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust days before Biden forced Shokin\u2019s firing, Painter met with the No. 2 official at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington and asked to meet officials in Kiev around the same time that Joe Biden visited there. Ukrainian embassy employee Oksana Shulyar emailed Painter afterward: \u201cWith regards to the meetings in Kiev, I suggest that you wait until the next week when there is an expected vote of the government\u2019s reshuffle.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s Washington embassy confirmed the conversations between Shulyar and Painter but said the reference to a shakeup in Ukrainian government was not specifically referring to Shokin\u2019s firing or anything to do with Burisma.\n\nPainter then asked one of the Ukraine embassy\u2019s workers to open the door for meetings with Ukraine\u2019s prosecutors about the Burisma investigation, the memos show. Eventually, Blue Star would pay that Ukrainian official money for his help with the prosecutor's office.\n\nAt the time, Blue Star worked in concert with an American criminal defense lawyer, John Buretta, who was hired by Burisma to help address the case in Ukraine. The case was settled in January 2017 for a few million dollars in fines for alleged tax issues.\n\nBuretta, Painter, Tramontano, Hunter Biden and Joe Biden\u2019s campaign have not responded to numerous calls and emails seeking comment.\n\nOn March 29, 2016, the day Shokin\u2019s firing was announced, Buretta asked to speak with Yuriy Sevruk, the prosecutor named to temporarily replace Shokin, but was turned down, the memos show.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBlue Star, using the Ukrainian embassy worker it had hired, eventually scored a meeting with Sevruk on April 6, 2016, a week after Shokin\u2019s firing. Buretta, Tramontano and Painter attended that meeting in Kiev, according to Blue Star\u2019s memos.\n\nSevruk memorialized the meeting in a government memo that the general prosecutor\u2019s office provided to me, stating that the three Americans offered an apology for the \u201cfalse\u201d narrative that had been provided by U.S. officials about Shokin being corrupt and inept.\n\n\u201cThey realized that the information disseminated in the U.S. was incorrect and that they would facilitate my visit to the U.S. for the purpose of delivering the true information to the State Department management,\u201d the memo stated.\n\nThe memo also quoted the Americans as saying they knew Shokin pursued an aggressive corruption investigation against Burisma\u2019s owner, only to be thwarted by British allies: \u201cThese individuals noted that they had been aware that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of Ukraine had implemented all required steps for prosecution \u2026 and that he was released by the British court due to the underperformance of the British law enforcement agencies.\u201d\n\nThe memo provides a vastly different portrayal of Shokin than Biden's. And its contents are partially backed by subsequent emails from Blue Star and Buretta that confirm the offer to bring Ukrainian authorities to meet the Obama administration in Washington.\n\nFor instance, Tramontano wrote the Ukrainian prosecution team on April 16, 2016, saying U.S. Justice Department officials, including top international prosecutor Bruce Swartz, might be willing to meet. \u201cThe reforms are not known to the US Justice Department and it would be useful for the Prosecutor General to meet officials in the US and share this information directly,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBuretta sent a similar email to the Ukrainians, writing that \u201cI think you would find it productive to meet with DOJ officials in Washington\u201d and providing contact information for Swartz. \u201cI would be happy to help,\u201d added Buretta, a former senior DOJ official.\n\nBurisma, Buretta and Blue Star continued throughout 2016 to try to resolve the open issues in Ukraine, and memos recount various contacts with the State Department and the U.S. embassy in Kiev seeking help in getting the Burisma case resolved.\n\nJust days before Trump took office, Burisma announced it had resolved all of its legal issues. And Buretta gave an interview in Ukraine about how he helped navigate the issues.\n\nToday, two questions remain.\n\nOne is whether it was ethically improper or even illegal for Biden to intervene to fire the prosecutor handling Burisma\u2019s case, given his son\u2019s interests. That is one that requires more investigation and the expertise of lawyers.\n\nThe second is whether Biden has given the American people an honest accounting of what happened. The new documents I obtained raise serious doubts about his story\u2019s credibility. And that\u2019s an issue that needs to be resolved by voters.\n\nJohn Solomon is an award-winning investigative journalist whose work over the years has exposed U.S. and FBI intelligence failures before the Sept. 11 attacks, federal scientists\u2019 misuse of foster children and veterans in drug experiments, and numerous cases of political corruption.
