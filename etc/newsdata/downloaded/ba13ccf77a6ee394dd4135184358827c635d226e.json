The singer, entertainer and Afro-Latina is proud of her heritage \u2014 that is, except for the racism that\u2019s still present within the Latinx community.\n\nA deep-rooted history of colorism and slavery contributed to a culture in which Latinx people are still discriminated against by members of their own community, even as they are made up of many different colors, shapes and sizes.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my mom used to always tell me that, because of the color of my skin, I would always have to work twice as hard to be recognized for my work,\u201d Amara told HuffPost in an interview. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I got older that I realized and understood what she meant by it.\u201d\n\nThe singer\u2019s mother is from the Dominican Republic and immigrated through the Mexican border to the United States in search of a better life. Inspired by the journey her mother took to get here, Amara, born Diana Danelys De Los Santos, has spent her career fighting for Black and Latinx representation.\n\nMaria Alejandra Cardona for HuffPost Amara La Negra, a Dominican-American hip-hop artist stands and poses in Miami, Florida on Aug. 29, 2019.\n\nAs she broke into the entertainment scene in Miami through television appearances on VH1\u2032s \u201cLove & Hip Hop,\u201d Amara wore her culture like a badge of honor. She incorporated soca, dancehall and Afro-beats into her music and performance, inspired by the sounds of her ancestors. But her success came with backlash \u2014 against her Black skin.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a classic one \u2014 people consider me to be physically attractive, and I get the, \u2018Oh my god, you\u2019re a pretty Black girl,\u2019 or \u2018For being Black, you\u2019re really pretty,\u2019\u201d Amara said. \u201cI went to do an audition for a soap opera, and they told me, \u2018You\u2019re probably not going to get the role because they want someone who looks more Latina.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cLa Negra\u201d from her stage name translates to \u201cthe Black one,\u201d which is how she said people referred to her during her time in the girl group Amara when they didn\u2019t remember her name. She uses that distinction as her stage name to celebrate her Blackness.\n\nMaria Alejandra Cardona for HuffPost\n\nInspired by the dismissive comments against her skin and look \u2014 her big hair is as powerful as her voice \u2014 Amara became an outspoken advocate against racial discrimination and colorism in the entertainment industry. She started performing on S\u00e1bado Gigante at a young age, which prepared her for stardom, but it was her role in \u201cLove & Hip Hop\u201d that helped fully expand her audience, influence and platform.\n\nRacism within the Latinx community is rooted in the Spanish, French and Portugese colonization of Latin America and the Caribbean, according to Dr. Melissa M. Valle, an African American Studies professor at Rutgers University.\n\nThe majority of Africans brought to the Americas by the transatlantic slave trade were enslaved in colonies throughout Latin America and forced to work on sugar, tobacco and rice fields. Indigenous people were also enslaved on these plantations. From Cuba to Brazil, slaves were a major part of agricultural growth throughout the region.\n\nA social hierarchy based on skin color was established by European imperialists in which white Europeans put themselves on top. Mestizos and mulattos \u2014 those of mixed race, part African or part Native \u2014 were below them. At the bottom were the African and indigenous enslaved people.\n\nMaria Alejandra Cardona for HuffPost\n\n\u201cThose become the central beginnings of a very long history of racial hierarchy in these spaces and they carry over to the U.S. community,\u201d Valle said.\n\nDuring Valle\u2019s visits to Latin America, she witnessed the harsh realities many people still face there because of their skin color, including verbal, physical and political attacks on Black people. In Latin media, the most prominent figures are light-skinned or white-passing.\n\n\u201cColorism plays out in a lot of different ways \u2014 marriage, education, prison sentences, income, occupational status,\u201d Valle said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing inherently better about light eyes, straight hair \u2014 it\u2019s something that comes from outside. It\u2019s interesting because people attempt to capture that and \u2018improve the race.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMejorar la raza,\u201d a common phrase in the community, reinforces the idea that white or lighter skin is better and amplifies the idea that producing light-skinned children should be the goal for many families and relationships.\n\nBut there\u2019s no one way that a Latina should look, Amara said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been discriminated against so many times and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve decided to be an activist,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to say the day that I die, my life mattered.\u201d\n\nAfter coping with her own challenges of overcoming prejudice, the reality TV star doesn\u2019t want Black and brown children to feel discouraged, underrepresented or looked down upon for their skin color.\n\n\u201cThey are the future. It\u2019s hard out here. It\u2019s been a hard journey for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my case, I get the best of both worlds. I\u2019m Black and Latina and we already know how it feels in the United States.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s referring to attacks from President Donald Trump who has called immigrants like her mother \u201canimals,\u201d \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ccriminals.\u201d\n\nMaria Alejandra Cardona for HuffPost\n\nDespite this rhetoric, Amara wants young people of color who are looking for Hispanic and Latinx role models to leave behind the colorism and racism of their communities and lift each other up. She wants to see them thrive.\n\n\u201cWith what we\u2019re seeing with our president and everything that\u2019s happening right now, it\u2019s only getting harder, but nothing is forever,\u201d Amara said. \u201cI want to make sure that the youth knows not to lose hope, nothing is impossible. Our ancestors didn\u2019t lose hope.\u201d\n\nFor Amara, the best way to make a change is to create.\n\n\u201cPeople feel as if, if you don\u2019t have a big platform, then what are you supposed to do? Use your voice to make a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cUnite people around your community to feel the same way that you do. Come up with ideas, concepts, reach out. There are so many things you can do.\u201d\n\nNuestras Voces Unidas (Our Voices United) is a HuffPost series created to honor Hispanic Heritage Month and amplify the diverse voices within the community.
