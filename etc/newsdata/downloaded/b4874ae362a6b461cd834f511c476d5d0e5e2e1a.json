The court said earlier this month that government lawyers had given formal legal statements that he would abide by the Benn Act and it would be a serious matter if he did not.\n\n\"Boris Johnson promised #Scottish court he would comply with #BennAct & not seek to frustrate it. Looks like he's breaking both promises,\" Joanna Cherry, a Scottish National Party lawmaker involved in the case said on Twitter.", "description": "UK PM sends unsigned letter to EU asking for Brexit delay", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9I0MT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
