I was speaking to a couple of British journalists this week who were saying that this was the first time that they had been out to America for the Super Bowl. They just can\u2019t believe how the whole city has become engulfed by the NFL and the Super Bowl.\n\nThe commercial investment that has been put into the game is huge. I know there are a lot of cultural differences and we are very different to the Americans in the way we see sport, but imagine if we could make a bigger spectacle out of the FA Cup final.\n\nEven if it\u2019s just getting players at a press conference or giving fans access to players to be able to see them in the build-up to the final, that\u2019s a small step that I think would make a massive difference. Opening the game up to the fans and letting the fans have some access to maybe a practice or a meet and greet would make the event more personal.\n\nThe state of Arizona will host Super Bowl 49 between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks\n\nThe University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale is all quiet leading up to the blockbuster event\n\nRecording artist Calvin Harris performs on stage during a festival organised just next to the stadium\n\nAround 100,000 people attended the festival on Thursday as they enjoyed Super Bowl week\n\nWhat I\u2019ve witnessed this week is mind-blowing. In downtown Phoenix it is like a walking Hall of Fame. There are players from every generation of the game walking around just soaking up the atmosphere. It would make a huge difference to the FA Cup final if we started to consider how we could market it and make it a bigger event, not necessarily on this scale.\n\nWe went to an event on Thursday when Calvin Harris was DJing and they literally built V Festival next door to the stadium. There were around 100,000 people there - it was that big. Even though it was raining it had that festival atmosphere. It\u2019s that kind of commercial investment that makes a massive difference.\n\nThey were all student-looking types at the festival, but it is all part of the Super Bowl and based around that. You might not be a football fan, but you\u2019ll still enjoy the activities provided by these big corporate companies because they\u2019re in town for the Super Bowl.\n\nKaty Perry will perform during the half-time show on Sunday night at the University of Phoenix Stadium\n\nThe Californian singer brought her dog to a press conference this week as she addressed the media\n\nFormer San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana (right) at an event in Phoenix on Thursday\n\nActor Nick Cannon (left) and rapper Nelly (right) perform at a Playboy Party during Super Bowl weekend\n\nThere are parties everywhere with all the big-names like Rihanna, Snoop Dogg and Jason Derulo. And obviously you can\u2019t help but avoid all the chicken wings, the loaded potato skins and the pitchers of ale flying around.\n\nIf we could maybe bring the people of the Football Association and Premier League over and just show them what the Americans do, we might be able to start to do something like this at home.\n\nSHUT DOWN THE OUTSIDE RUN\n\nThere are a lot of aspects to this game that are very similar to last year. Once again we have got the very young Russell Wilson, playing in his second Super Bowl on the bounce, going up against one of the grand masters of the game in Tom Brady, who is making his sixth Super Bowl appearance and won three already. I would argue that Brady is probably the best quarterback to play the game.\n\nEverybody knows how good the Seattle Seahawks are on offense. The key for the Patriots defense is containing the read option (where the quarterback has the option of giving the ball to the running back or instead holding onto it and running around the outside). If the Patriots can shut down the outside run and read option then they have got a real chance of containing the Seahawks offense.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks defense is without doubt one of the best defensive groups we have seen in recent times. The \u2018Legion of Boom\u2019 are the best group of defensive backs in the NFL. They are very talented, very quick and all quite tall. It is quite intimidating for wide receivers of the opposing team to see. The Seahawks defensive backs don\u2019t show many different looks in their defensive formation, but they\u2019re so quick and so fast in closing down opposing teams.\n\nTom Brady is preparing to play in his sixth Super Bowl having won three titles already\n\nBrady and his Patriots team-mates practice in Tempe, Arizona in the lead up to Sunday's showdown\n\nRussell Wilson will play in his second straight Super Bowl having been in the league for just three seasons\n\nI think Brady will struggle because the Seahawks defensive line is very quick. Brady likes to sit in the pocket and is not very mobile. He will stand in the pocket for the longest time until he finds a receiver who is wide open. I think the Seattle Seahawks will focus on that and blitz a lot. They won\u2019t necessarily put a spy on Tom Brady because he doesn\u2019t run, but they\u2019ll use the extra man to blitz.\n\nTight end Rob Gronkowski is going to be one of Brady\u2019s key targets. Against the Colts, the Patriots mixed up the run and the pass. If they can establish the run game on Sunday it will help them when they try and pass, because the Seahawks defense will be leaning towards stopping the run.\n\nPete Carroll used to be head coach of the Patriots before Robert Kraft fired him and that\u2019s when the Belichick era began, so Carroll might have a chip on his shoulder.\n\nPatriots tight end Rob Gronkowski is fitter and healthier this season than he has been for a long time\n\nSeattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman speaks out during media day in Phoenix\n\nPete Carroll (left) was sacked as Patriots head coach and replaced by Bill Belichick (right)\n\nWilson led the Seattle Seahawks to a crushing 43-8 victory over the Denver Broncos last year in New Jersey\n\nPeople in town have been saying that if you give Patriots head coach Bill Belichick two weeks to prepare then he is going to come up schemes, plays and formations that the opposing team night not necessarily have seen on film.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s catastrophe of me calling the Denver Broncos to win - and we all know what happened there - I\u2019m going to toe the line on this one. I think it\u2019s going to be a close game and I hope it goes down to the fourth quarter.\n\nMARSHAWN'S SILENCE\n\nI have seen Marshawn Lynch\u2019s press conferences and it is quite amusing to sit and watch him and listen to what he hasn\u2019t got to say. We saw commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s press conference on Friday and he was asked about Lynch.\n\nThe commissioner is right in saying that we have all got jobs to do and there are some elements to our job that we don\u2019t really like but we have to do them to fulfill the role and our positions.\n\nBut American football teams have 60 different players, so why keep putting up a guy who doesn\u2019t say anything? We are not going to get anything from him, so put another running back in.\n\nMarshawn Lynch has been at the centre of attention this week for what he hasn't said to the media\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that people have to do parts of their jobs they might not like\n\nVERNON'S FAVOURITE SUPER BOWL MOMENTS\n\n3. New York Giants 39-20 Denver Broncos - Super Bowl XXI, January 25, 1987\n\nThis was the year I really got into American football and I knew the rules and what to look out for. The sun setting over the iconic Rose Bowl in California made the whole event look beautiful.\n\nI remember watching up to the end of the first quarter and had school the next morning. But my mum stayed up and recorded the game on VHS but paused the adverts, because if you didn\u2019t pause the adverts you wouldn\u2019t get the whole game on one tape.\n\nThat Super Bowl started a period of about 10 years where my mum or dad would pause the adverts to get it all on a VHS video. In that game we saw John Elway and Lawrence Taylor and two iconic teams. That\u2019s one Super Bowl I remember for it\u2019s visual beauty.\n\nThe iconic Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California on the day of Super Bowl XX in 1987\n\nHead coach Bill Parcells is lifted into the air after the New York Giants beat the Denver Broncos\n\nNew York Giants running back Joe Morris scores a touchdown at the Rose Bowl in California\n\n2. Pittsburgh Steelers 27-23 Arizona Cardinals - Super Bowl XLIII, February 1, 2009\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl I watched live and I was fortunate enough to be sat just over the end zone when Ben Roethlisberger threw the final touchdown to win the game for the Steelers. Little did I know that the wide receivers coach for the London Warriors, Marvin Allen, was on that squad and he won a Super Bowl ring in that game.\n\nSantonio Holmes celebrates catching the game-winning touchdown for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2009\n\n1. Chicago Bears 46-10 New England Patriots - Super Bowl XX, January 26, 1986\n\nThis was the first American game that I ever saw. It was one of the best defenses that had ever played the game. I wasn\u2019t aware at the time, but as I slowly taught myself about the history of the game, I realised that Bears defense was one of the best to play the game.\n\nIt was also the first time I saw Walter Payton run the football and they had William Perry aka 'The Fridge'. That was the season that made him a household name, even in Britain.\n\nThe Chicago Bears dominate the New England Patriots to win Super Bowl XX in New Orleans\n\nWalter Payton runs the ball for the Chicago Bears (left) as William Perry aka 'The Fridge celebrates (right)", "description": "VERNON KAY: The way that the NFL builds a city around an American football event is phenomenal.
