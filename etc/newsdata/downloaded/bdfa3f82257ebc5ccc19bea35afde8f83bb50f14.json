She knows my style and I love her taste so I could just sit back and enjoy my wedding wonderland.\u2019\n\nThe newlyweds did their first dance to Tennessee Whiskey and after an evening of celebrating with family and friends, they ordered a heart-shaped pizza to top it all off.\n\nSo dreamy (Picture: Instagram)\n\nCassie met her now hubby Alex Fine at the gym and apparently they got talking about marriage pretty early on before falling pregnant not long after beginning their relationship.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who is due to give birth to a baby girl in December said initially she and Alex were debating whether or not they should wed before or after the baby but settled on before.\n\nThe ceremony was an intimate one with 14 guests total\u2014all close family.\n\n\u2018We wanted a simple venue with a beautiful view that felt warm and romantic,\u2019 Cassie said. \u2018We wanted the aesthetic to reflect how comfortable and content we feel with each other.\u2019\n\nThey worked with Melissa to coordinate everything in just two weeks!\n\nCassie is seven months pregnant (Picture: Instagram)\n\nBecause Cassie was seven months pregnant and they had a very short lead up to the wedding, the singer employed the help of stylists and friends Marni Senofonte and Deonte Nash to create a custom gown with tailor Arturo and his daughter Christina from Rancho Tailors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey spent a week and a half getting the dress made.\n\nShe wanted the dress to feel romantic but comfortable for what she describes as her \u2018intimate backyard wedding.\u2019\n\nThe team decided on a dress with billowy, off-the-shoulder sleeves for romance and a high slit for movement. \u2018When it came to this moment in my life, I knew that [it was] the easier the better for me,\u2019 she said. \u2018We chose to create the lace veil to give it a touch of the classic.\u2019\n\nShe then paired it all with Jimmy Choo shoes and simple studs.\n\nThe groom wore Musika styled by Paris Libby, while all of the male guests were in black tuxes and the women were asked to wear cream.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
