The Scotland head coach, speaking at a hastily-arranged press conference at the team hotel in Hamamatsu, said: \u201cWe believe the game hasn\u2019t been cancelled because the weather forecast is much improved for Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the game will be played and that\u2019s what we have to keep faith with. [World Rugby] have made the call with a lot of certainty and a lot of confidence that the game will go ahead on Sunday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d hope that everyone who is involved in the tournament would want the game to be played and that they will do all they can to ensure that it is. We have to have faith in the organisers that the game will be played even if it\u2019s behind closed doors or at a different venue.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A television screen at World Rugby\u2019s press conference shows the potential impact of Typhoon Hagibis.

Japan trained at Prince Chichibu, which has previously hosted international games.\n\n\u201cWhat do we need? We need officials, we need players. The way I read the rules was that you can\u2019t change days but you could change venues and contingencies would be in place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve since been told there is force majeure [measures in the rules] and things can change because of exceptional circumstances. If that means Monday because it takes a day for things to be put back in order then who knows. But right now I think they\u2019re planning on it going ahead on Sunday.\u201d\n\nHowever, tournament director Alan Gilpin has already ruled out a change of date. Asked if Scotland\u2019s game could be pushed back 24 hours, he told an emergency press conference in Tokyo: \u201cWe have looked again at the potential to apply some consistency to our contingency plan across all the games and we treat all the matches fairly.\n\n\u201cItaly are in the same position as Scotland are in. It is a huge match and we would be loving to play that game. But we won\u2019t treat that match any differently.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\n\nAsked if it would be a bitter blow to see Scotland dumped out on the back of a cancelled fixture, Townsend said: \u201cIt will make things very unusual for a World Cup in any sport to be decided by a game being called off on one day.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re looking out of your hotel window at 5 o\u2019clock on Sunday afternoon and it\u2019s sunny. It would be strange if a game couldn\u2019t take place that day or the following day.\u201d", "description": "Gregor Townsend has called on World Cup organisers to do everything they can to ensure Scotland\u2019s win-or-bust clash with Japan goes ahead on Sunday \u2013 even if it means playing the crucial showdown behind closed doors", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b92237358ea2449aa68f62b6c2e1ab3578891494/0_208_4890_2934/master/4890.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2dafabac1bd7834b7a8122137bf37208", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
