Getty\n\n'Disaster ridden' transport department should lose control of Britain' trains\n\nHobhouse said that if in government, the Lib Dems would take the running of Britain's railways out of hands of the \"disaster ridden\" Department for Transport, and give it to a new government body called the Railway Agency.\n\nThe party's conference motion calls for stations to be turned into \"hubs\" which are better integrated with local bus routes and cycling infrastructure. Stations should be fitted with solar panels and wind turbines, and more lines electrified, the motion adds.\n\nThe Lib Dems also want to simplify train fares by ensuring travellers using contactless cards are automatically charged the cheapest fare and any paid compensation they are owed for delays.\n\nHowever, the Lib Dem conference motion is to reject the Labour Party's call for railways to be nationalised, describing the plan as a \"costly distraction\" that \"will not make the railways cheaper, more punctual or less micro-managed.\"\n\nThe Conservative government has repeatedly come under fire for the state of Britain's railways.\n\nWhile fares have increased by over 50% since 2016, punctuality is the worst it has been in well over a decade, and commuters who use franchises like Northern have suffered months of cancellations and delays.\n\n\"It is no surprise people in Britain aren't using the trains with the Tories in charge. If we want people to use public transport we have to ensure it's a reliable mode of transport,\" Hobhouse told Business Insider.\"", "description": "The anti-Brexit party wants to increase the number of Brits who use trains in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "authors": ["Adam Payne"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7cede12e22af38ed61f094-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
