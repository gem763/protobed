Emmentaler has iconic holes in it, and it\u2019s also the world\u2019s largest cheese.\n\nWe visited the Emmentaler Shaukaeserei in town of Affoltern in Emmental, east of Bern, to see how it\u2019s made.\n\nEighty per cent of the production of all Emmentaler AOP comes from this region, with 150 producers.\n\nVisit INSIDER\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nCheese production started in the area east of Bern over 200 years ago. It\u2019s a hilly region, so good for cattle grazing. 17,700 tons of Emmentaler are produced each year in this region by 150 family dairies, with 16 distributors.\n\nEmmentaler is made in various regions in Switzerland: Aargau, Bern, Glarus, Lucerne, Schwyz, Solothurn, St. Gallen, Thurgau, Zug, and Zurich. It was granted AOP protection from the EU in 2002, meaning that these areas are the \u201cprotected designation of origin.\u201d But there are a few qualifications for this. The milk has to be from dairy farms no fewer than 20 kilometers away. And it must be produced using raw milk.\n\nThe Emmentaler Schauk\u00e4serei show dairy opened in 1989.\n\nThe world-famous holes? They\u2019re created by a reaction in the bacteria. After one month of storage, a strain of bacteria, Propionibacterium shermanii, consumes lactic acid and releases carbon dioxide. These bubbles become trapped in the cheese rind and form holes (also known as eyes).\n\nThe size of Emmentaler wheels is heavily regulated, as most have a diameter of 80 to 100 centimeters. They need to be a minimum 75 kilograms and maximum 120 kilograms. For cheese produced here, a kilogram costs 19 Swiss francs, or $US19, so one wheel could cost over $US1,900.\n\nThe cheese is matured to a four-month classic, eight-month \u201cReserve,\u201d 12-month \u201cAOP extra,\u201d and 24-month vintage.\n\nNinety-five per cent of cheese sold with Emmentaler label are fake Emmentaler. The brand Emmentaler Switzerland actively pursues \u2018copies\u2019 of the cheese. Each cheese can be identified by its bacteria, as well as a bespoke cheese number on the rind.\n\nProduced by Ju Shardlow and Charlie Floyd.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
