It beheaded seven American, British and Japanese journalists and aid workers and a group of Syrian soldiers, boasting of their butchery in videos released to the world.\n\nThe SDF have detained some 10,000 ISIL fighters, about 2,000 of them with foreign nationality and many of those from European countries that have refused to take them back.\n\nTrump said the Kurds were still guarding many of the captured fighters, but also said Turkey would be responsible for them.\n\n\"If the Kurds don't watch, Turkey will watch. They don't want those people out any more than we do,\" he said.\n\nTrump and other US officials have repeatedly pressed other nations across Europe and the Middle East to take back the detainees who are their nationals, but international leaders have proved reluctant to do so.\n\n\"They should go back, by the way, they should go back to Europe. Many of them came from Europe. And they should go back to Germany and France,\" Trump said Wednesday.\n\nTrump said other leaders told him they didn't want the detainees.\n\n\"We don't want them either,\" he said. \"Nobody wants them but they're bad and somebody has to watch over 'em.\"", "description": "The military is holding the two men, part of a cell notorious for beheading its hostages, at an undisclosed location.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/4d74837d1db849029752caa191b2b549_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
