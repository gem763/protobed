Nobody can look into it.\u201d\n\nMore: Tommy Hilfiger Sells Plaza Hotel Penthouse to Auto Tycoon for $31.25 Million\n\nIn addition to the four-level, 3,871-square-foot house, which has five bedrooms, six bathrooms and four reception rooms, the property also includes an outside home-office building and a two-bedroom guest house.\n\n\u201cThe previous owner, who lived in the house for 50 years, did all the renovations and added the two buildings,\u201d Mr. Lamb said. \u201cWhile the original building had a charm of its own, the renovations transformed the old-fashioned residence, adapting it for modern living by creating open-living spaces and adding a generous kitchen.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe current owner bought the property on June 19 for \u00a37.1 million, according to property records; she could not be reached for comment and Mr. Lamb would not disclose her reason for selling so soon after the purchase.\n\nFrom Penta Good Company: Toad&Co\u2019s Mission To Educate About Apparel Pollution\n\nAccording to Mr. Lamb, the street was once known as Five Fields Row and was renamed Mozart Terrace after Mozart\u2019s 1764 stay.\n\nMozart, along with his elder sister, Maria Anna, and their father, spent only a year in the capital city, where he wrote \u201cSymphony No. 1 in E\u266d major, K. 16.\u201d\n\nThe wunderkind siblings performed in many of London\u2019s theaters before moving in 1765 and touring throughout Europe. Mozart died at age 35 in 1791 in Vienna some three months after the premiere of his final opera, \u201cThe Magic Flute.\u201d\n\nA plaque, installed 80 years ago, commemorates Mozart\u2019s stay in the Belgravia townhouse, and close by there\u2019s a bronze statue of the composer that was erected a quarter-century ago.\n\nBelgravia, a quiet residential neighborhood, is less than a half mile from Sloane Square and Victoria train station. Through the centuries, it has been home to a number of well-known people, including Sackville-West, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, James Bond actors Roger Moore and Sean Connery, \u201cFrankenstein\u201d writer Mary Shelley, investor/philanthropist George Soros and composers Andrew Lloyd Webber and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Nancy A.
