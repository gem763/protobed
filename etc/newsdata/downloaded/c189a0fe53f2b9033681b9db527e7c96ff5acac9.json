(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s quest to clean up his league\u2019s apparent tampering epidemic has produced a host of new guidelines aimed at providing a clearer framework for contact between teams, players and agents.\n\nRoughly two months after Silver said that he believed \u201cleakage and slippage\u201d around free agency deadlines was \u201churt[ing] the perception of integrity around the league,\u201d the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors met in New York City on Friday to approve a series of rules \u2014 including stiffened punishments \u2014 for illegal pursuits of players and salary-cap circumvention by teams.\n\nAt a news conference Friday, Silver said that the measures, approved unanimously, are an expression of the league\u2019s desire to \u201censure that we\u2019re creating a culture of compliance\u201d and to establish a \u201clevel playing field\u201d in free agency for all 30 teams.\n\nUnder the new guidelines, the NBA league office has the power to suspend executives, void contracts, take away draft picks and fine a team up to $10 million if it is caught violating the league\u2019s tampering rules. The maximum fine amount was raised from $5 million under the previous framework.\n\nIn addition to the possible punishments, NBA teams will now be expected to report any and all violations of the tampering rules by agents, to provide annual certification from lead executives that they have adhered to the rules and to retain records of their contact with agents and rival teams for a full year. Five teams each season will also be subjected to a random audit to ensure their communications are above board.\n\nTampering was a hot-button issue throughout the 2018-19 season and offseason, as big-market teams jockeyed to land superstars like Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis in months-long pursuits.\n\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers sign free agent forward Kawhi Leonard (right) in July after a months-long pursuit that saw Coach Doc Rivers fined for tampering.

The Clippers later signed Leonard as a free agent. In another, then-New Orleans Pelicans forward Davis was fined $50,000 for making a public trade request in January through his agent. Davis was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, long said to be his preferred destination, in June.\n\n[Doc Rivers talks Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and how the Clippers pulled off deal of the decade]\n\nSilver and the league office were also concerned by the flood of agreements that greeted the start of the agency period. Under the NBA\u2019s guidelines, free agents cannot communicate with suitors before June 30 and cannot officially sign new contracts until after a seven-day moratorium has passed. By July 1, NBA teams and players had already agreed to more than $3 billion worth of new agreements, with some of those deals being announced within minutes after the opening bell on June 30. In many cases, teams and players acknowledged that they had not even bothered to conduct formal meetings.\n\nAs a result, tampering rules, long a sore spot for small-market teams and fan bases, appeared more toothless than ever.\n\n\u201cThe tampering optics looked bad and [the league office] had to clean it up,\u201d one league executive said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a more compliant environment because no GM wants to be the first one caught. But I can promise no one is going to report an agent.\u201d\n\nOne NBA coach suggested that the new guidelines will do little to curb player-to-player contact, a significant aspect of modern free agency. Another executive noted that agents will be able to find workarounds to indirectly express their clients\u2019 interest to team personnel during unauthorized time periods. Still, the general sense among league personnel was that the NBA\u2019s more intensive rules structure and increased punishments were worthwhile steps.\n\nSilver said that while the NBA has broad investigatory power to root out egregious tampering violations \u2014 including the ability to seize electronic devices \u2014 he remains cognizant of privacy concerns. The league\u2019s aim with its new rules, the commissioner explained, was to create an \u201cappropriate amount of tension\u201d and to establish a \u201csignificant threat\u201d in hopes of discouraging improper activity by teams.\n\n\u201cNone of us want people looking into our private affairs,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI am not interested in looking in any aspects of people\u2019s life outside of what is relevant to the operation of their teams. I\u2019m not looking to take devices. But I think people who operate in a public company environment, who operate in a financial world, who are used to compliance procedures, understand that you have to find the right balance of disclosure and privacy.\u201d\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox\n\nRead more on the NBA:\n\nIn diverse Toronto, the Raptors\u2019 sports hijab is hailed as a win for inclusivity\n\nSpain teaches USA Basketball a lesson about the value of commitment\n\nAfter 15 years, 10 teams, three titles and one devastating knee injury, Shaun Livingston retires", "description": "League commissioner Adam Silver expressed the league\u2019s desire to \u201censure that we\u2019re creating a culture of compliance\u201d and a \u201clevel playing field\u201d in free agency.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter", "September At Pm", "Ben Golliver Joined The Washington Post As The National Nba Writer In Previously", "He Was A Senior Writer At Sports Illustrated Covering The Nba.
