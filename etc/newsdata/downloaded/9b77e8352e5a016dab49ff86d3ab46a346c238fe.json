That gives you 16 days off in a row but only uses seven days of leave.\n\n\u2022 Book long weekend breaks for Labour Day (or its equivalent in your state), plus any other state-specific long weekends (such as Grand Final Friday in Victoria, Reconciliation Day in the ACT or Western Australia Day) and local holidays (such as show days in Tasmania or race days in the Northern Territory).\n\nFollow this approach and you\u2019ll use your precious 20 days of annual leave to maximum advantage. If you have extra holiday leave owing, you can potentially extend that even further by \u201cboosting\u201d the long weekends.\n\nSadly, 2020 isn\u2019t the best ever year for this strategy. In 2019, Anzac Day fell in the same week as Easter Monday, making it possible to take 16 days off around Easter while still only using seven days of annual leave. We won\u2019t see that happen again until 2025. But hey, I\u2019ll take what I can get.\n\nAngus Kidman is the editor-in-chief and travel guru for Finder.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/4abc964634ea0433cc71137baeafb2dd", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
