That word may sink him. \u201cUnfit\u201d was Corbyn\u2019s sombrely measured term. Brazen, brass-necked, thrashing about wildly in proclaiming the 11 supreme court justices \u201cwrong\u201d, Boris Johnson\u2019s performance last night defied all democratic dignity. Add in your own outrage here, but most shocking of all was not the prime minister but the wall of Conservative hoodlums whooping and cheering him on. Conservative? These are law-defying anarchists willing to stir up violence in the country.\n\nThere was nothing spontaneous about the prime minister\u2019s brutish attack-as-the-best-defence. When confronted by female MPs warning him against using language that spurs on daily death threats to them and their children, that only added to his glee. Misogyny is part of his focus-grouped assault on every kind of political correctness, though it comes naturally to a man whose worst insult is \u201cgirly\u201d.\n\nHow \u2018girly swots\u2019 came back to bite Boris Johnson | Lucy Mangan Read more\n\nSome MPs were in tears after Paula Sherriff, the MP whose constituency is next door to the assassinated Jo Cox\u2019s, warned that those people who threaten her \u201coften quote his words, surrender act, betrayal, traitor and I for one am sick of it. We must moderate our language and it has to come from the prime minister first\u201d. But he had never heard \u201csuch humbug in all my life\u201d. Every time his incendiary language was challenged, he taunted them back by referring to the Benn Act, passed by a majority of the House, as \u201cthe surrender act\u201d.\n\nThe most grievous affront came in answer to Tracey Brabin, Jo Cox\u2019s successor MP: \u201cThe best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d The idea that the strong pro-EU campaigner who was shot and stabbed to death by a far-right anti-EU terrorist should be commemorated by Brexit had Jo Cox\u2019s husband calling for moderation: \u201cI feel a bit sick at Jo\u2019s name being used in this way\u201d he tweeted, quoting her famous dictum, \u201cAlways hold on to what we have in common.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:43 Outrage as Boris Johnson dismisses dangers of inflammatory language as 'humbug' - video\n\nIf his party had some notion that the mantle of office would sober up this self-intoxicated scoundrel, they were wrong. If they thought charm and wit would be his winning political weapons, they were wrong. Not a scintilla remains of that \u201cone nation\u201d, \u201chealing\u201d and \u201cbringing the country together\u201d guff he talked in the leadership campaign. This is two-nation politics, deliberately driving the rift ever deeper. This is calculated contempt for parliament and the judiciary, designed to stir anger among his Brexit base outside against that imagined \u201celite\u201d. That\u2019s the definition of demagoguery, turning voters into \u201cthe mob\u201d to force his way where he finds democratic and judicial processes barring his wishes.\n\nJohnson\u2019s plan is to turn his supreme court humiliation into rocket fuel at the polls | Martin Kettle Read more\n\nWill it work? We have to believe it will shock more citizens than it inflames, and women especially will be revolted by his sneering contempt for violence against them. He hardens the battle line between the sides, making compromise near-impossible. In the House that is his intent, to make striking a deal with the EU more difficult and gaining support for any deal from many on the Labour benches improbable: will they really cross the floor to back a deal that keeps this brute in office? His behaviour suggests a no-deal Brexit is what he truly wants. Inevitably the Tory party chairman, James Cleverly, floundered on the Today programme this morning in his defence.\n\nJohnson\u2019s strategy, devised with his unwise adviser Dominic Cummings, is to act so savagely that he provokes Labour into calling a vote of no confidence, as time and again he goaded Corbyn for cowardice, too frit to face the voters. Neither Labour nor the other opposition parties will be so foolish: they will call an election only when the no-deal danger has been delayed with an extension to the 31 October leaving date.\n\nTo date, the PM\u2019s every tactic has been a disaster: losing every vote, his proroguing of parliament failed, blundering into the supreme court\u2019s damning verdict. The net effect last night was yet again to bolster Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s standing, his calm dignity of language casting Johnson as the wild-man extremist. The prime minister bawling insults at him as \u201ca communist\u201d fails when in front of everyone\u2019s eyes is a grownup refusing to be riled by this spoilt adolescent.\n\n\u201cPM Flays Scared Corb on Election\u201d, claims the Sun\u2019s front page but I doubt that\u2019s what its readers saw on their screens. The Mail trumpets a poll showing that 64% of Labour voters want an election. So does the Labour leadership, and Johnson can have one any day he chooses \u2013 as long as he goes to get an EU extension first.\n\nWhat next, no one knows. But whether the Conservative party can ever regain its dignity is yet to be seen: expect nothing but raucous endorsements at its upcoming conference. The most shameful sight of the night was their MPs\u2019 behaviour, with Jeremy Hunt rising to back Johnson\u2019s antics with no hint of reprimand, after Jacob Rees-Mogg shamelessly accused the supreme court of conducting a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d.\n\nThose who have left look back on their old party with horror: Amber Rudd warned yesterday of Johnson\u2019s \u201cdishonest and dangerous\u201d language, but they have all quit. New candidates to replace the 21 departed will be of the Johnson stamp, chosen by the same aged firebrands who foisted this unspeakable prime minister on the country. It was never more imperative that this party should be resoundingly defeated at the next election \u2013 and that will take tactical collaboration by a progressive alliance of opposition parties. Johnson last night will have helped forge that determination.\n\n\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The shameful spectacle of Johnson\u2019s MPs cheering him on can only serve to unite opposition efforts to defeat him, says Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee", "authors": ["Polly Toynbee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a32d30d8e7182f1b0493d1f2842d9f174b263b97/0_319_5340_3204/master/5340.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f90239abf0f203f5eebdcb3a693c8126", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
