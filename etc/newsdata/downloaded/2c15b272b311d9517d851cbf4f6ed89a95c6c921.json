She\u2019s milking this Hillary feud for all it\u2019s worth, for perfectly sound reasons: Hillary\u2019s unpopular, she\u2019s the face of Democratic electoral failure, and she\u2019s the embodiment of the hawkish Wall-Street-friendly neoliberalism that Gabbard\u2019s cohort on the party\u2019s left wing detests. The obvious thing to do for a candidate who\u2019s struggled to get traction in the primary is to accept the gift Clinton gave her when she called her a \u201cRussian asset\u201d in an interview recently by training her fire on Hillary going forward. Who knows? Maybe anti-Clinton sentiment among progressives will earn Tulsi a second look.\n\nDoesn\u2019t seem to be happening yet, though, if you believe the latest polling.\n\nIn fact, given how impressive Gabbard is on paper and onstage, it\u2019s sort of shocking how badly she\u2019s doing in the primary this year.\n\n.@HillaryClinton, your foreign policy was a disaster for our country and the world. It\u2019s time for you to acknowledge the damage you have caused and step down from your throne. https://t.co/r95HYvTjML pic.twitter.com/tSwCRx82sU \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 23, 2019\n\nMediaite dings Gabbard for claiming in that clip that overthrowing Qaddafi made the problem of global nuclear proliferation worse. Didn\u2019t Qaddafi gives up his nuclear program years *before* we backed the uprising against him? Yes, but Gabbard\u2019s point, I think, is that other rogue regimes \u2014 North Korea, foremost \u2014 have learned a perverse lesson from Qaddafi\u2019s downfall. Namely, he gained nothing from the United States by cooperating with us on nukes, not even a firm promise that we wouldn\u2019t turn on him later. On the contrary, if Qaddafi had kept his nuclear program and eventually developed weapons we wouldn\u2019t have dared to intervene in Libya on the rebels\u2019 side for fear of how the madman might have reacted. Fast forward almost a decade and Kim Jong Un has successfully leveraged his own nuclear arsenal for fawning diplomatic treatment from the president of the United States. That\u2019s what Gabbard is pointing to here. The Obama/Hillary decision to reward Qaddafi\u2019s denuclearization with death convinced other strongmen not to denuclearize.\n\nBut I digress. Is this new strategy of slamming Hillary paying off for her? Well, in the three polls taken since October 18, when Clinton\u2019s \u201cRussian asset\u201d comments emerged, Gabbard\u2019s polled at three, zero, and two points, good for an average of 1.6. That\u2019s \u2026 right around where she\u2019s been polling all along, possibly a tiny bit of improvement but clearly nothing to signify real legs for her from this incident. Maybe if Clinton had attacked her earlier in the race, before Democratic voters had settled on a top three or four among the field, it might have mattered.\n\nOr maybe not. As I say, a candidate with as much going for her as Gabbard should already have been pulling better than one or two points in most polls before this Hillary incident. She has congressional experience, military experience, converses fluently in policy issues, especially foreign policy, she\u2019s preternaturally poised and self-assured onstage, she\u2019s telegenic, and she\u2019s younger than anyone else in the field except Buttigieg. She seems plenty left-ish enough for most progressives too. You would think she\u2019d at least be keeping pace with Mayor Pete, but she\u2019s gone nowhere. Why? We could blame her Assad apologetics or her youthful support for conversion therapy for gays as red flags, but I suspect it\u2019s the right\u2019s interest in her \u2014 and her willingness to welcome that interest, with multiple appearances on Fox News \u2014 that\u2019s scared off most liberals. It\u2019s strange that she would court those votes, replete with cameos on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show, knowing how it risks alienating her core constituency of progressives. Her party\u2019s base loathes Carlson and was destined to find her suspicious because she doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s why conspiracy theories like \u201cTulsi\u2019s a Russian asset\u201d follow her around: Absent an obvious motive to make nice with righties, critics grasp for ulterior motives.\n\nHer support among righty populists and even alt-righters is also hard to understand in turn. If it\u2019s a foreign policy thing, is her foreign policy really that different from, say, Bernie Sanders\u2019s? All of this explains why you see \u201cWhat\u2019s up with Tulsi Gabbard?\u201d takes in the media way more than you do, say, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with Amy Klobuchar?\u201d takes. Gabbard\u2019s strategy, such as it is, is difficult to discern and so is the reason for her unique appeal to segments of the other party. She may be the only candidate running for president this year on either side of the aisle who has more fans on the other side of it than on her own.\n\nSay this for Tulsi\u2019s lefty supporters, though: They\u2019re loyal.\n\nPotentially big news\u2026 Among Americans who say their 2020 vote depends on who is nominated\u2026 25% support Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination\n\n12% support Gabbard\n\n12% Biden\n\n9% Warren\n\n6% Buttigieg (Sample size is only just over 800 voters) \u2014 G. Elliott Morris (@gelliottmorris) October 23, 2019\n\nSee why Clinton\u2019s worried about Gabbard going third-party? For an outsized segment of her supporters, it\u2019s Tulsi or bust with respect to them turning out to vote Democratic next year.\n\nIn lieu of an exit question, go read Becket Adams regarding a very belated correction by big media to what Hillary actually said about Gabbard in that now famous interview. She did call her a \u201cRussian asset,\u201d but when she said that \u201cthey\u201d are grooming her to run as an independent candidate, she (allegedly) meant that Trump and the GOP were grooming her, not the Russians. That is, Clinton might not be accusing Gabbard of being in cahoots with Moscow to influence the race next fall, just of being a useful idiot who\u2019s following her own Kremlin-friendly foreign policy preferences.", "description": "Queen.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/c-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
