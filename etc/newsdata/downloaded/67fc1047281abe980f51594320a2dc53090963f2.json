I wasn't. I was very, very chilled'", "language": "en", "text": "If you were to build a superhuman, you probably could not design a better version than Dina Asher-Smith. History making, national record breaking, the first Briton to win three medals at a World Championships, the first British woman to win a sprint world title and the fastest in history and \u2013 according to Lord Coe \u2013 one of the most marketable athletes in the world right now.\n\nNever mind marketable, the nation fell in love with the Londoner in Doha. The girl-next-door who is equally at home discussing a sparkly eyeshadow as nailing the graciousness of sporting fair play, she put her own celebrations on hold to turn back and pick up two fellow competitors in English Gardner and Anthonique Strachan who collapsed during the 100 and 200 metre semi-finals. At every opportunity, she has been sure to celebrate others, share the limelight \u2013 name checking Katarina Johnson-Thompson, or her relay team-mates.\n\nMost memorable of all was the special moment she shared with her mother, Julie, following her gold medal win, on the steps up to the media gantry.\n\n\u201cHow does she even get into these random places?\u201d laughs the 23-year-old, incredulous at her mother\u2019s resourcefulness. \u201cShe was really happy, we were both a bit emotional. But then she was telling me not to ruin my cashmere. I was like, \u2018cashmere?\u2019 Turned out she meant cat eye, as in make-up, because I was crying. And that\u2019s when I stopped crying, I was like, \u2018Oh mum, it\u2019s cat eye, not cashmere!\u2019 So we started laughing. I don\u2019t think anyone thought that was the conversation we were having. But that\u2019s literally what we were talking about. She was telling me not to cry, and I just rolled my eyes.\u201d\n\nWhen we speak, Asher-Smith is eating her lunch. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, chewing in-between questions, \u201cit\u2019s one of those days where I\u2019m just running around. I\u2019m doing Jonathan Ross later\u201d. Since returning home to gold confetti and celebrations at Heathrow on Monday, the end of a long season has been followed by back-to-back appearances and sponsor commitments. \u201cI haven\u2019t really stopped yet,\u201d she says quietly. Unlike last year, when she famously ordered pizza for breakfast following her triple European gold medal win, she has yet to really let her hair down. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything crazy or out of the ordinary, I\u2019ve mainly been trying to catch up on sleep.\u201d The wildest it has got is munching her way through some profiteroles and a trip to her favourite Soho restaurant for an avocado chicken burger.\n\nIn some ways, her achievements are yet to sink in \u2013 \u201cDenise [Lewis] and Jess [Ennis-Hill] said it would take a few weeks,\u201d she notes. In other ways, hers were results that were planned for, worked for over the course of a season \u2013 and further back still \u2013 a masterful combination of hard work and planning from her and her long-time coach John Blackie. For while media and public have marvelled at her history-making feats, Asher-Smith coolly admits that her results in Doha were not a surprise. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t,\u201d she says, simply. \u201cAs an athlete you learn to keep your aspirations to yourself, not to share your goals.\u201d\n\nGoing into her fourth World Championships, as the favourite in the 200m, the stakes seemed high, the pressure building.
