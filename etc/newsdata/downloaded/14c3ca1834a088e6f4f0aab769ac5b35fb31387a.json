The bipartisan-backed law prevents the government from using taxpayers\u2019 money to pay for portraits of federal officials. The upshot of this is that Washington DC\u2019s prestigious National Portrait Gallery has portraits of every U.S. president hanging on its walls except Trump.\n\nLondon-based artist Ben Turnbull, who specializes in US-themed collages, wanted to change this by offering the NPG his new portrait of Trump. Turnbull, who has previously exhibited with street artist Banksy, created MADe in America using cutouts of the face of MAD magazine\u2019s iconic fictional cover star Alfred E Neuman. The work is part of his new exhibition in Bermondsey.\n\n\u201cI hoped it would have been accepted in the spirit it is given \u2014 to make sense of this hugely divisive figure,\u201d Turnbull tells Capital. \u201cIt is more a portrait of a nation than of him.\u201d Alas the NPG isn\u2019t MAD for it.\n\nIn emails seen by Capital, NPG director Kim Sajet says: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the portrait is appropriate for the NPG... I can\u2019t see how this would be a good fit for us.\u201d What does Trump (hardly bashful when it comes to his self-image) think of the picture? The White House didn\u2019t get back to Capital.\n\nSwitching accounts\n\nReports suggest anti-Brexit millionaire Roland Rudd, founder and chairman of PR firm Finsbury, is preparing to step down as chair of Open Britain, which runs the People\u2019s Vote campaign. Change is afoot at Finsbury as well. As HSBC gears up to appoint a permanent chief executive to succeed John Flint, Europe\u2019s biggest bank has switched its corporate strategic communications representation from Finsbury to rival PR company Brunswick.\n\nIn defense of WeWork\n\nWeWork needs all the friends it can get right now, what with the troubled property startup having to be rescued by SoftBank. But unlikely support for WeWork comes via Steve Norris. The former Tory party mayoral candidate, now chair of the Soho Estates property company, tells Capital WeWork has revolutionized real estate.\n\n\u201cWhether that company survives or not, what it has done is shown how the new way of flexible working has to involve landlords who actually provide service to their tenants,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe tradition of landlords over decades, if not centuries, has been to say: \u2018Here\u2019s your room, give me the cash.\u2019 While WeWork itself is a model I personally am not going to be subscribing to, the principle of co-working, which WeWork established, is the way forward.\u201d\n\nRising stars\n\nHats off to the 25 rising stars honored at Financial News\u2019s annual Asset Management Awards Europe. Marte Borhaug, global head of environmental, social and governance investment solutions at Aviva Investors, told us she is working on an app that will get people get more involved in shareholding voting.\n\nGareth Simmons, fund manager at Columbia Threadneedle, has had a busy 2019: in July the Threadneedle (Lux) European Short-Term High Yield Bond fund was launched, which he co-manages and he is now on shared parental leave following the birth of his second child.\n\nMeanwhile the teenage son of Oliver Bell, co-head of equity for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at U.S. asset manager T Rowe Price, which won Equity Manager of the Year, sounds like a rising sports star. \u201cMax was on the books of Crystal Palace [FC], but now he wants to be a ski instructor,\u201d Bell told Capital.\n\nCant comment\n\nCallum Cant\u2019s new book Riding for Deliveroo, recounting his time working for the online food-delivery company, claims workers are rebelling against Deliveroo in a modern-day class uprising.\n\n\u201cThe organization of work at Deliveroo produced a technical class composition \u2014 an organization of individual workers into a working class doing a job\u2014 which was ready to explode,\u201d writes Cant who is currently on a national tour promoting his tome.\n\n\u201cWe were subject to authoritarian algorithmic management; we had no guaranteed wages; we worked in constant danger; we had no commitment to or control over the labor process.\u201d\n\nCant, who works for left-wing group Momentum, tells Capital that not only has there been no reaction from Deliveroo to the tome, he hasn\u2019t heard from any of the company\u2019s bosses since he was given his kit when he first started riding for them. Deliveroo didn\u2019t deliver a verdict on the book to Capital.", "description": "The empty spot on the walls of Washington\u2019s National Portrait Gallery for Trump\u2019s painting will remain vacant a while longer, and WeWork finds an unlikely...", "authors": ["Tom Teodorczuk", "Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FX410_17trum_ZG_20171031212334.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
