However, they later retreated as the substance of the reports became more doubtful.\n\nBy 9:25 AM ET (1325 GMT), futures were at $53.69 a barrel, still up 0.3% on the day, but well off the intraday high. International blend futures were at $59.49, up 0.7% on the day.\n\nThe retracement gathered strength as the International Energy Agency downgraded its forecast for global oil demand growth next year by 100,000 barrels a day. It also cut its forecast for 2019 by a similar amount but said this was due to changes in the calculation of last year\u2019s output.\n\nIn addition, it noted that petroleum stocks in advanced economies had increased for the fifth consecutive month in August, leaving them close to the record levels seen in 2016, when they topped 3 billion barrels.", "description": "Oil Prices Retreat After Iran Tanker Scare, IEA Update", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB1F067_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
