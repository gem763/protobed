That\u2019s over. All of the political factions that have been in power since 2003 are expired,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a fresh start. We want a homeland.\u201d\n\nIn Karbala, at least one protester was killed late Monday, according to Iraq\u2019s High Commission for Human Rights. Media reports quoted eyewitnesses as saying masked men fired on demonstrators staging a sit-in about a mile from the shrine of Imam Hussein, a revered figure in Shiite Islam.\n\nAD\n\nNews agencies quoted Iraqi security officials as saying 18 protesters were killed in the violence. But provincial officials, including Karbala\u2019s governor, denied that figure. The local police chief said in a statement Tuesday that videos on social media showing protesters running from gunfire had been fabricated to \u201cincite the street\u201d against the government.\n\nAD\n\nThe latest violence, in which 83 demonstrators have been killed since Friday, follows similar unrest that began earlier this month. In those demonstrations, 149 people were killed, and a government inquiry blamed Iraqi security forces for using lethal force.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi approved the investigation\u2019s recommendations, including firing senior security officials. But as protests swelled in recent days, demonstrators turned their rage toward political parties and Iran-backed militias, whose members fired on crowds outside their headquarters.\n\nAD\n\nIn Maysan province, about 200 miles southwest of Baghdad, at least 14 people were killed Saturday in violence involving the powerful Iran-linked militia, Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq. Protesters were attempting to storm the group\u2019s headquarters and when gunmen fired on them, killing at least three.\n\nThe demonstrators, including supporters of Sadr, who commands a rival militia, staged a counterattack and wounded the local leader of the militia, eyewitnesses said. They then followed the ambulance carrying the militia leader and his brother to the hospital and there beat them to death. Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq has vowed revenge.\n\nIn Karbala, demonstrators breached the Iranian consulate and raised an Iraqi flag. Footage also showed protesters tearing down a poster of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIran\u2019s influence in Iraq has grown since it backed the militias who spearheaded the fight against the Islamic State. Tehran\u2019s allies, including former militiamen, now occupy powerful positions in Iraq\u2019s government and in parliament.\n\nDespite the country\u2019s vast oil wealth, Iraq continues to suffer from poor infrastructure, a flagging economy and routine power outages. Demonstrators have rejected the prime minister\u2019s calls to reshuffle the cabinet and introduce a reform package, saying they want a whole new system.\n\nIn Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square, the demonstrations had a more festival-type atmosphere, despite the repeated attacks by security forces.\n\nStudents from elementary schools to universities joined the demonstrations wearing their school uniforms. Restaurants delivered food to the protesters for free and barbers gave haircuts to those camped out in the square. Medical volunteers treated injured protesters and clerics arrived to show their support.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll the while, Iraqi security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the demonstrators.\n\n\u201cEven facing violent attacks by protesters, security forces are required to limit their response strictly to what is proportionate and necessary to maintain order,\u201d Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at the New York-based Human Rights Watch, said in a statement this weekend.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve now seen time and again are Iraqi security forces resorting to unnecessary force, even against nonviolent protesters,\u201d she said.\n\nCunningham reported from Istanbul.\n\nAD", "description": "The fifth day of protests saw new crowds amid reports of severe casualties in Karbala to the south.", "authors": ["Mustafa Salim", "Erin Cunningham", "Middle East Reporter Covering Iran", "Turkey", "Syria", "The Wider Region"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2ki2WQBN085IOWyM0C2H2C_hA18=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3SFNKEH2J4I6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
