As Ridgeley writes, \u201ceverything looked effortlessly fun for us because it was effortlessly fun.\u201d They were wizards with a pop hook. They were young and handsome. They were agile dancers, capable of plausibly wearing tiny Fila shorts (an early sponsorship deal) and cropped shirts.\n\n\u201cWham! George Michael & Me\u201d is the first time Ridgeley has written about his partnership \u2014 professional and personal \u2014 with Michael since his bandmate\u2019s shocking, untimely death at 53 on Christmas Day in 2016 .\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose in search of salacious tidbits will be disappointed. The nearest Ridgeley comes to dropping any bombs is carping about Michael\u2019s obsession with his hair, described here as an \u201cuncontrollable mass of wiry frizz in the humidity . . . George bleached, teased, and blow-dried to such an extent that friends who caught a glimpse of him on the front page of tabloids sometimes mistook him for Princess Diana.\u201d\n\nWhat emerges instead is a tender, admiring tribute to Michael, whom Ridgeley repeatedly calls his best friend. The tone is affable (Chapter 12, for instance, is titled Party Nights and Neon Lights) and light on analysis. Few observations obtain more gravitas than: \u201cIf somebody had told me when I was twelve that one day I\u2019d be appearing on Top of the Pops, I\u2019d have thought they were completely nuts.\u201d But for fans of \u201980s pop, it\u2019s an engaging, breezy read.\n\nThe two met in 1975, writes Ridgeley, when a new boy arrived at Bushey Meads Comprehensive School in Hertfordshire, England. Awkward, chubby, and wearing a pair of oversized glasses, the boy blushed in mortification as the teacher mangled his Greek name of Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRidgeley was assigned as Panayiotou\u2019s mentor, and an uncomplicated but deep teen-boy friendship bloomed, united by a shared love of Queen, David Bowie and Joy Division, Monty Python sketches and juvenile humor. Ridgeley gave him the lifelong nickname of Yog, derived from the pronunciation of his name as \u201cyor-goh.\u201d\n\nThey also shared a bond as the sons of immigrant fathers. Michael\u2019s dad was a sternly traditional Greek Cypriot who changed his first name from \u201cKyriacos\u201d to \u201cJack\u201d when he moved to London. Ridgeley\u2019s Egypt-born father changed his surname from Zacharia to Ridgeley after seeing \u201cRidgeley Gardens\u201d on a street sign and deciding that it sounded properly English.\n\nThe rise of Wham! was meteoric. At 16, the two music obsessives were writing songs and recording demos in the modest house where Ridgeley lived with his parents. At 18, they formed Wham!; by 19, they\u2019d landed a record contract.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore the release of their debut album, Fantastic, they\u2019d decided that Michael should take full creative rein and write and arrange their songs. Ridgeley\u2019s reaction was typically even-keeled. \u201cThe decision still smarted a little, but it was the right one,\u201d he writes. \u201cGeorge was so clearly developing into a writer of rare ability . . . I clearly couldn\u2019t match him.\u201d\n\nFor Michael (by then he had, like his father, changed his name), songwriting \u201cseemed to have become the vehicle through which he could draw out the person he wanted to be,\u201d writes Ridgeley. Despite his glorious voice and his uncanny ability to deliver pop hooks, \u201cbeneath the surface George was still struggling with his looks, his weight and his self-image. The new character gave him a layer of psychological armor.\u201d\n\nNot that they seemed to have discussed this. Their friendship, during the band and afterward, was joke-y and bloke-y. \u201cWhen it came to romance, neither of us had ever confided in the other,\u201d Ridgeley recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s just not what our friendship was about.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile filming the video for \u201cClub Tropicana\u201d in Ibiza (\u201cfun and sunshine, there\u2019s enough for everyone!\u201d) Michael called Ridgeley into his room and announced that he was gay. Ridgeley was unfazed. (\u201cI wanted him to be happy.\u201d)\n\nBut the era was less queer-friendly, and Michael, who had grown ferociously ambitious, decided that coming out was a career risk he couldn\u2019t take (he ultimately came out in 1998). It helped that Ridgeley was cultivating an image as \u201cRandy Andy,\u201d the promiscuous club hound. \u201cI\u2019d been painted as the sinner, but the situation suited [Michael] just fine,\u201d writes Ridgeley. \u201cWhile the press were distracted by me, they were blind to the truth about his sexuality.\u201d\n\nThree studio albums later, Wham! was done. \u201cWe were a band built on the idea of youth and exuberance,\u201d writes Ridgeley. \u201cThere was no way we could stay kids forever.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter the breakup, Michael zoomed to superstardom with the release of 1987\u2019s Faith , while Ridgeley settled into his identity as The Other Guy in Wham! He did a stint of racecar driving, released a solo album that barely charted and married, in a match made in pop heaven, Bananarama\u2019s Keren Woodward (his bio says he \u201cnow pursues a variety of interests\u201d).\n\nThe book ends with Ridgeley texting his old friend on Christmas Day 2016, wishing him a happy holiday and thanking him for the annual Christmas hamper of treats that Michael always sent. Soon afterward, Michael\u2019s sister phoned with the devastating news that he had died. Ridgeley, blindsided, doubled over in grief and began to sob.\n\nThese days, Ridgely will come across something that takes him back to the early days and find himself overcome with nostalgia \u2014 not for the screaming girls and the stadium shows, the \u201ctumult and the palaver,\u201d but for the person he has lost. \u201cI\u2019ve not had as strong a bond with any other chum since then,\u201d Ridgeley writes wistfully. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered that type of intensity is harder to rediscover as you get older.\u201d\n\nSome of Michael\u2019s fans will likely wish that this memoir was more revealing, but others will be grateful that their idol had a steadfast friend like Ridgeley.\n\nJancee Dunn\u2019s latest book is \u201cHow Not to Hate Your Husband After Kids.\u201d\n\nWham!, George Michael & Me\n\nA Memoir\n\nBy Andrew Ridgeley\n\nDutton. 368 pp. $28\n\nAD", "description": "Ridgeley\u2019s new memoir is a breezy read for fans of 1980s pop music.", "authors": ["Jancee Dunn"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Fr5uHd800NJvrSU_H2ItU_bhPxo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EFVS7OXFFQI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
