Multiple unconfirmed reports said Syrian soldiers had already entered the Kurdish-held city of Manbij in line with Sunday\u2019s agreement. On Monday morning, Turkey\u2019s president signalled that Syrian militia groups allied to his country were preparing to attempt to capture the city. \u201cWe are about to implement our decision on Manbij,\u201d Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said in Istanbul.\n\nFurther to the east, the Syrian army said it had reached the city of Tal Tamr, bringing it to within 12 miles of the Turkish border.\n\nUnconfirmed reports said that Syrian army troops had clashed overnight with Kurdish fighters in the city of Qamishli, which was not surrendered to Damascus in Sunday\u2019s Russian-brokered agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkish fighters and their allies were continuing to attack Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, two cities that have been the focus of Ankara\u2019s mission to push Kurdish fighters \u2013 whom it considers to be terrorists \u2013 away from its southern border and create a buffer zone where it says it will resettle at least 1 million Syrian refugees.\n\nSyria and Turkey have exchanged hostilities sporadically throughout the past nine years but their forces have never engaged in sustained combat, pulling back from doing so at key moments in earlier Turkish incursions into Syrian territory.\n\nThe prospect of fighting between Syrian troops and Turkish soldiers and their allies raised deep concerns over the security of the estimated 11,000 Islamic State fighters and their families who are detained across the region. More than 700 people with links to the terrorist group escaped from detention camps in the area on Sunday.\n\nPlay Video 4:04 What does Turkey's military action in northern Syria mean? \u2013 video explainer\n\nSyrian state media said on Monday that units from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s army was moving north to \u201cconfront Turkish aggression on Syrian territory\u201d. Unconfirmed reports said the deal between the Kurds and the regime would be extended to apply to the whole of north-east Syria.\n\n\u201cAfter everything, it seems that the fate of the Kurdish people [is to be abandoned],\u201d Ismat Sheikh Hassan, the leader of the military council in Kobane, told local television. \u201cWe did everything that we could, we called upon the international community \u2026 but it did not result in a solution. We urged all Kurdish [groups] to show solidarity, but no one listened.\u201d\n\nThe deal is likely to bring a bitter end to five years of semi-autonomy for Kurdish groups in north-east Syria. Turkey\u2019s Operation Peace Spring started on Wednesday after Donald Trump announced that US forces would withdraw from the region.\n\nTrump had not specified a timeframe for the US withdrawal from Syria, but on Sunday, the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, said the remaining 1,000 special forces had been ordered to leave \u201cas safely and quickly as possible\u201d as the fighting between Turkey and the Kurdish-led Syrian Defence Forces began to threaten US military positions.\n\nThe SDF has been funded and trained by the US to combat Isis since 2015, finally defeating the militant group in March after losing 11,000 troops in the battle.\n\nTurkey, however, says the largest unit of of the SDF, the Kurdish YPG, is a terrorist group indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to abandon the SDF to an inevitable Turkish assault has been widely criticised, even by his staunchest allies, as a betrayal of a military partner that has unleashed a humanitarian disaster and threatens to sow the seeds of an Isis resurgence amid the ensuing chaos.\n\nOn Sunday, at least 750 people with suspected links to Isis reportedly fled a displacement camp in north-east Syria. The women and children who were formerly part of the \u201ccaliphate\u201d had been held in a secure annexe at the Ain Issa camp. They began to riot and scared away the guards after Turkish shelling struck nearby, said Abdulkader Mwahed, the joint president for humanitarian affairs in the Kurdish-held area of Syria.\n\nThe camp was home to about 13,000 people, including three suspected British orphans and a British recruiter for Isis, Tooba Gondal.\n\nAdditional reporting by Hussein Akkosh", "description": "Deal to support Kurds in exchange for key cities threatens to open new front in civil war", "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan", "Michael Safi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e86dbc5e8280ed47fdadbbc26e5f201e4dd3f433/0_97_3923_2355/master/3923.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7894b7cc6ed079d6ea67183314de024", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
