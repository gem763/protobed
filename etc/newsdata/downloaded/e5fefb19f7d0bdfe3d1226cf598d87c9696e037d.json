With fees added on the total price paid for it was \u00a3845,000.\n\nThe 20 five guinea Vigo coins were struck from gold plundered from a Spanish galleon, They were struck with a distinctive 'VIGO' mark\n\nThe whopping price is the highest ever shelled out for a British coin, smashing the previous record of \u00a3630,000 for an 1817 George III silver crown.\n\nThe series of Vigo coins were made out of 7.5lbs of gold captured from a Spanish galleon. After the British failed to capture Cadiz in October 1702, the fleet intercepted Spanish treasure ships laden with Aztec and Inca gold, coming back from America.\n\nThe British attacked the Spanish fleet in Vigo Bay and captured the gold and silver on board.\n\nThe booty was then returned to Britain where, desperate for gold, the Bank of England had it melted down and turned into coins.\n\nThe pieces feature a bust of Queen Anne on one side and coats of arms on the other.\n\nOf the 20 coins struck 16 are known of. This coin spent many years with a private collector who decided it was the right time to sell it.\n\nThe obverse of the coin shows the date of its striking and includes a traditional Tudor rose as well as coats of arms of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland\n\nStephen Fenton, director of Baldwin's said: 'We figured it would get a very high price like this because the market is so strong the moment.\n\n'These English five guinea coins are among the most desirable coins about and we had a lot of interest.\n\n'The history of the Vigo coins really appeals to collectors and even brings in a whole different market from Spain.\n\n'Because of the price there will always be a slight limit to how many people can buy them but on this occasion interest was incredibly strong.'\n\nMr Fenton added: 'The coin is in amazing condition and has been given the highest grading possible by an expert.\n\n'It had been with a private collector but with the market as strong as it is at the moment, he decided it was the right time to place it in our auction.'\n\nThe price is vastly higher than similar sales in recent years. Two years ago a similar coin was sold at for just \u00a3225,000.\n\nThat \u2018Vigo\u2019, sold at Boningtons in November 2016 was at the time only the sixth example of its type to be offered for sale in the last 50 years.\n\nAnother example sold for \u00a3240,000 in Lewes in December 2012. And auctioneers Spink sold one in 2005 for \u00a3130,000 and an inferior example for \u00a382,000 two years later.\n\nThe 'Vigo' coins are incomparably more valuable than equivalent coins from a similar period.\n\nA two-guinea Queen Anne gold coin dating from 1713, which was similarly struck but without the \u2018Vigo\u2019 mark, sold for just \u00a35,400 in 2016.", "description": "Price beats the previous world record for a British coin by more than \u00a3200,000. Only 20 of the 'Vigo' five guinea pieces were minted, to celebrate the theft of American gold form the Spanish fleet.", "authors": ["Joel Adams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/30/20/9193458-0-image-a-16_1548878548912.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-30"}
