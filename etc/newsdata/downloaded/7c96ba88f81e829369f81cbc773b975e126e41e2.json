Ltd, a financial technology firm, has raised $3.2 million (approximately Rs 22.69 crore at current exchange rates) in its Series A funding round led by Artis Labs, a venture capital firm based in California.\n\nOther investors that participated in the round include Abstract Ventures, a San Francisco-based seed investor.\n\nThe Bengaluru-based startup will use the funds for research and development, and commercialisation of its platform, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe latest round takes the total money Crediwatch has raised to about $5 million.\n\nThe startup said it had previously raised $1.6 million from investors such as Modern India Ltd, Contrarian Vriddhi Fund, Better Capital, Vijay Kumar Jatia, former Flipkart chief people officer Mekin Maheshwari and Pithambar Gona, the former managing director of Blackstone Private Equity Asia.\n\nMeghna Suryakumar, founder and chief executive officer at Crediwatch, said the firm was aiming to judge the creditworthiness of small and medium-sized enterprises by measuring trust through factors such as verifiable data, insights and good behaviour.\n\n\u201cThe ecosystem needs a dynamic business information exchange to create transparency and a continuous monitoring of borrowers to weed out bad cases early,\u201d Suryakumar said.\n\nSeparately, Artis general partner Stuart Peterson said the firm was confident in its investment because of Crediwatch\u2019s commitment to addressing the gaps in the digital lending space, adding that the firm was positioned to leverage the failure of conventional credit rating and underwriting methods through their technology.\n\nCrediwatch, which was founded in 2013, is a data insights-as-a-service company that provides businesses and lenders with credit intelligence that allows them to increase and improve their trading activity. It provides its solutions for financial institutions, enterprises as well as legal and private equity firms, according to its website.\n\nDeals in the fintech segment\n\nThe financial technology segment and startups providing services that fall under this category have been the subject of heavy investor attention, even as the larger financial services sector continues to face the fallout of the liquidity crunch caused by the collapse of IL&FS last year.\n\nLast month, the US-based investment firm Tiger Global Management invested $25 million in online stock brokerage Upstox and Silicon Valley-based VC firm Ribbit Capital led a $21.4 million Series B funding round in online investment platform Groww.\n\nSimilarly, NeoGrowth Credit Pvt. Ltd, a small and medium-enterprises-focused fintech lender, raised $17 million in debt financing from France\u2019s Proparco SA. Online peer-to-peer lending platform LenDenClub raised $1 million in a pre-Series A round led by Artha Venture Fund.", "description": "Crediwatch Information Analytics Pvt.
