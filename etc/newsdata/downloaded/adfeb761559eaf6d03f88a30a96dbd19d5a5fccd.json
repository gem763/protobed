Is that stomachache that\u2019s bothering your child caused by the new teacher? Is classroom anxiety the reason she\u2019s sad, tense or bouncing off the walls?\n\nNo one wants to be that helicopter parent who swoops in and rescues a youngster from any adversity. But no parent wants to stand by while a child suffers harm because of a bad teacher, either. The best path for parents requires patience, and the communication skills needed to figure out what\u2019s actually happening in the classroom and work with the teacher to solve problems.\n\nRiding out a year with a stressful teacher can sometimes help a child learn to deal with challenges. Carol Lloyd was worried when her daughter, Tallulah, was assigned an elementary school teacher several years ago with a reputation for yelling and humiliating students. She decided not to intervene. \u201cYou want your kids to be resilient and good problem-solvers, and to know they can survive in difficult situations,\u201d Ms. Lloyd says.\n\nShe encouraged Tallulah to try to get along with the teacher and do the best work she could, and she survived the year unharmed. Some classmates weren\u2019t so lucky. One developed a math phobia and needed tutoring help after the teacher criticized her harshly for making mistakes, says Ms. Lloyd, editorial director of GreatSchools in Oakland, Calif., a nonprofit provider of school ratings and other resources for parents.\n\nIt\u2019s important to act, however, if a parent sees that a child is at risk of emotional damage.\n\nClinical psychologist Eileen Kennedy-Moore counseled a parent whose son was getting scolded a lot by a new teacher, even though he hadn\u2019t had trouble before. The mother asked for a meeting, but it was a disaster. In the child\u2019s presence, she says the teacher ranted on and on about what a terrible person he was and kept going even after he burst into tears, leaving the mother unnerved. She took the problem to the principal, who moved her son to a different class.\n\nRegardless of the cause, the teacher\u2019s classroom wasn\u2019t emotionally safe, says Dr. Kennedy-Moore, author of \u201cKid Confidence.\u201d She adds, \u201cShe was blind to the child\u2019s pain.\u201d\n\nIn most cases, Dr. Kennedy-Moore advises against rushing to change a child\u2019s classroom. \u201cBe very careful about removing a child from a situation, because the message you\u2019re giving a child is, \u2018This is too hard for you to deal with. You can\u2019t handle it,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Kennedy-Moore says. \u201cIn life, we\u2019re going to have to deal with all kinds of people, and children need to know that.\u201d\n\nPrincipals invest a lot of time behind the scenes matching students with teachers and trying to create balanced classes, says Nora Carr, a Greensboro, N.C., school administrator. Many schools face a teacher shortage, giving administrators less flexibility in resolving staffing problems.\n\nTeachers\u2019 reputations can be misleading. Amy Behrens tells of one teacher rumored to be both the best and worst teacher ever. \u201cHe works well with kids who can handle his brusque manner and intensive work. But for kids who get hurt by a brusque manner and a little sarcasm, he doesn\u2019t work so well,\u201d says Ms. Behrens, a Newton, Mass., parent coach and educator.\n\nRyan Darcy wondered at first whether a teacher at his oldest son\u2019s school would be a good fit, but soon saw that she was great with children. Here he sits with his wife, Lindsay Darcy, and sons, left to right: Austin, 3; Graham, 5; and Nolan, 8. Photo: Darcy Family\n\nAnd first impressions aren\u2019t always accurate. When Ryan Darcy first met one of his son\u2019s past teachers, she seemed very laid-back. He wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d be a good fit for his son, who is energetic and eager to learn. He soon realized she was great with students, however, and his son thrived in her class, says Mr. Darcy of Coventry, Conn.\n\nIf your child comes home upset or scared, ask what he\u2019s feeling, Ms. Behrens says. Try to figure out exactly what upset him: Was it the teacher\u2019s words, actions or facial expressions? And what was happening in the classroom before that? \u201cYour child may have just given you the punchline, and not the 12 things that led up to that,\u201d Dr. Kennedy-Moore says.\n\nConsider the possibility that your child is misunderstanding the teacher\u2014mistaking jokes for ridicule, or confusing encouragement to not give up on getting the answer independently with an unwillingness to help.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How would you act if your child had a teacher you don\u2019t love? Join the conversation below.\n\nA difficult teacher can provide an opportunity to help your child internalize your family\u2019s values and standards. If your child struggles with a teacher who insists on perfect work, explain why you think perfectionism isn\u2019t healthy, Dr. Kennedy-Moore says. Then, offer a different viewpoint, like encouraging your child not to let a fear of mistakes get in the way of his excitement about learning.\n\nIf your child\u2019s problems persist for more than a few days, ask the teacher for a meeting. Start the conversation on an upbeat note, by saying something positive about the class or acknowledging that the beginning of the year can be hectic. Then, describe in concrete detail the problems you\u2019re seeing at home and trace possible causes.\n\nConsider acknowledging, \u201cI wasn\u2019t there, so I don\u2019t know exactly what happened, but this is what I heard,\u201d Dr. Kennedy-Moore says. Aim to understand the teacher\u2019s goals and to work together.\n\nIf your efforts with the teacher fail and you escalate the problem to the principal, be prepared to calmly describe specific teacher behaviors and the impact on students, Dr. Carr says.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about a difficult teacher\u2019s impact on future classes, consider telling the principal what you\u2019ve observed after the school year is over and asking if training or coaching might be available, Ms. Behrens says.\n\nOscar Rosenberg of Miami says taking a respectful approach paid off when asking his son\u2019s teachers for help.

Oscar Rosenberg hesitated to complain to the teacher when his 4-year-old son, Abe, started coming home from preschool with his lunch untouched. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be just another one of those parents who complain or whine,\u201d he says. But he also wanted Abe to develop healthy eating habits, so he asked for a meeting.\n\nHe began on a positive note, saying he knows children are easily distracted in a cafeteria with other students. He asked questions to understand the staffing challenges and time pressure the teachers faced, then described his concern. Soon, his son started coming home with his lunch mostly eaten, says Mr. Rosenberg, an assistant organizer for Miami Dads, a South Florida support and networking group. \u201cBeing kinder to the teacher gave us an edge,\u201d he says.\n\nIF YOUR CHILD DISLIKES A NEW TEACHER\n\nDO\n\n* Give the teacher a chance to earn your trust by attending open houses and reading handouts.\n\n* Ask your child in detail about specific behavior by the teacher that upset her.\n\n* Try to understand the teacher\u2019s challenges and goals before making a judgment.\n\n* Hold open the possibility of working with the teacher to solve any problem.\n\n* Set an example of proactive, cooperative behavior.\n\nDON\u2019T\n\n* Believe everything you hear about a teacher.\n\n* Complain about the teacher in your child\u2019s presence.\n\n* Go public with criticism of a teacher via gossip or social media.\n\n* Go over a teacher\u2019s head to the principal right away.\n\n* Get angry or threaten a teacher or school official.\n\nWrite to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.com", "description": "Parents must decide whether to stay on the sidelines or intervene, with both options carrying some risk.", "authors": ["Sue Shellenbarger", "Sue.Shellenbarger Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EZ036_Workfa_SOC_20190913141054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
