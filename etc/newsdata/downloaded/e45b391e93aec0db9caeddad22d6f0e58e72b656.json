Supreme Court.\n\nFenton maintained they are seeking \"specific documents\" which they believe will back up their assertion that American authorities wanted to use the extraordinary powers of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to investigate Meng, before she was officially arrested by the RCMP in December 2018.\n\n\"We are not relying on conjecture, guesswork and wishful speaking,\" he said.\n\nMeng was arrested on an U.S. extradition warrant after arriving at Vancouver's airport on a flight from Hong Kong. She was on a stopover to Mexico City with a final destination of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe U.S. wants Meng extradited to face trial on charges related to allegations she misled bankers about Huawei's relationship with a shadow company in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nBefore she was arrested, Meng was detained by CBSA officers for about three hours as they seized her electronic devices, searched her bags and asked her questions.\n\n\"It's our submission that there was effectively no legitimate purpose to the CBSA's actions,\" said Fenton.\n\nThe defence believes the FBI and other American authorities were pulling the strings and are asking Justice Heather Holmes to order the disclosure of documents they say will prove their case.\n\nLawyers for the attorney general, on the other hand, claim CBSA agents acted within the normal parameters of their powers, treating Meng as they would any other traveller.\n\nAssociate Chief Justice Heather Holmes listens as defence lawyer Richard Peck argues that his client's rights were violated. (Jane Wolsak)\n\n'That is not routine'\n\nIn documents filed in advance of this week's hearing, the Crown claims it has already provided defence with an unusually large amount of records relating to Meng's arrest and none of it proves anything out of the routine.\n\nBut Richard Peck, another of Meng's lawyers, scoffed at that idea.\n\n\"The way Ms. Meng was dealt with was anything but routine,\" Peck told the judge after painstakingly taking the court through videos of her interactions with CBSA officers.\n\nMeng Wanzhou's lawyers claim the extraordinary powers of the CBSA were abused when she was detained at Vancouver's airport in December 2018. (Mark Blinch/Reuters)\n\nHe pointed to the fact that as soon as CBSA officers intercepted Meng, they seized her laptop and mobile devices and placed them in bags specially designed to block out all communication.\n\n\"For what purpose? To serve as evidence for a foreign law enforcement agency,\" Peck said.\n\n\"That is not routine. There is nothing routine about this.\"\n\n'Air of reality'\n\nIn order to convince Holmes to grant an order for additional disclosure, Meng's lawyers need to convince her that their allegations have \"an air of reality\" that would warrant a stay of proceedings if proven.\n\nThe attorney general claims the assertions of collusion are unfounded and that there is no way they should result in the case being tossed.\n\nAnd here is a close-up of the ankle bracelet that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MengWanzhou?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MengWanzhou</a> wears 24/7 as part of her bail conditions.
