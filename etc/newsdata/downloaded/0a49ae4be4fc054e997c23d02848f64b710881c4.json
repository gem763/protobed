In the medium term, maybe after some time, I will think about it.\"\n\nWhen asked if an offer from Ferrari could change things, he added: \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"It's not impossible, but it's getting harder and harder with my age. Now I could go back and enjoy it, which was impossible in my last years in the championship,\" Alonso said of a potential F1 return.\n\nFreedom for Alonso\n\n\"Nothing has changed. I said goodbye in Abu Dhabi in 2018. After all those years I had to take a deep breath and clear my head. The years before that were difficult.\"\n\nAlonso is currently preparing for a potential run at the famous off-road Dakar rally, insisting he is enjoying the differences compared to F1.\n\n\"Such freedom does not exist in F1,\" he said.\n\n\"I can't find the right word, but let's say you are a puppet of the team in F1. All-day long you are told what to do, what to eat, how to train, when to go to bed.\n\n\"But I am already a more complete driver by practicing for the Dakar. And that is exactly why I chose to do these different things. I want to develop as a driver.\n\n\"With more luck, I could have become world champion three or four times. But I do not think I would have as much respect as I have today without doing the other things I have done,\" Alonso added.", "description": "'Everyone asks when I will return, but it's not in my immediate plans.
