I would take wagon load after wagon load to the junk yard,\u201d he said. \u201cI got 75 cents for 100 pounds.\u201d Baird became \u201ca strong street fighter\u201d among the scavenger gangs that prowled the makeshift shacks and the railroad tracks, tussling over empty cigarette wrappers. \u201cYou got money for a ball of foil. If I found a piece of hard cardboard, I used it to cover the holes in my shoe soles.\u201d A recovered patch of linoleum was heaven.\n\n\n\nToday, Baird laments, \u201cno one knows I exist.\u201d\n\nWhen Baird was nine, an older sister of his died of a cerebral hemorrhage\u2014an experience that seared him emotionally and fostered his lifelong rebellion against authority and religion. \u201c\u2018If there is a God, why should she suffer?\u2019 I thought. Here was my beautiful, kind, smart sister, dead and all because we didn\u2019t have money for a doctor.\u201d He is estranged from his surviving siblings. \u201cA sister still works for the Republican Party,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are all conservative except me.\u201d\n\nBaird graduated from Brooklyn College in 1955. He married that same year, then dropped out of New York Medical College in 1963, when he was forced to choose between books and food for his three children. In 1971, after too many death threats for his abortion work, Baird moved his wife and children away for their safety. That absence led to divorce. Baird says this is the saddest price for his unrelenting activism: \u201cI lost them all. The kids grew up in a Catholic community. My granddaughter says I murder babies.\u201d\n\nAs he embraced an activist career, Baird also mastered the flamboyant art of headline-grabbing, using the media to publicize his cause. He knew precisely what he was doing with that famous can of contraceptive foam in 1967, in the dark ages of bans on birth control. \u201cPolice were standing around, with guns,\u201d Baird recalled. \u201cI reached down to an unmarried coed and gave her the can of foam.\u201d A restive crowd at the Boston University event, estimated at upward of 1,500 students, jeered the police as they moved to handcuff Baird. \u201cI pulled my hand away and silenced the crowd,\u201d he said. \u201cI took out the sales receipt from Zayres, the store that had sold me the foam. It was a cost of $3.00 with a charge of nine cents for sales tax. I said, \u2018Now how can the state collect tax from an \u201cillegal\u201d sale?\u2019\u201d\n\nTabloid headlines made the most of it: \u201cVICE SQUAD NABS BU BIRTH CONTROL SPEAKER.\u201d Baird was led away to prison, and charged with violating a 19th century law still on the books that punishes crimes against \u201cchastity, morality and decency.\u201d If he had lost the case, Baird could have been sent to prison on multiple counts for a combined 10 years.\n\nBaird remembers the innocent-looking candy bar on his cell cot his first night in Boston\u2019s brutal Charles Street prison, where he served 36 days of a three-month sentence before being released on appeal. \u201cBeside the candy bar was a note [from a friendly inmate] warning me to throw it on the floor, stomp on it, \u2018Whatever you do, don\u2019t eat it. That means you would be a \u201csweetheart\u201d to someone.\u2019\u201d Baird\u2019s rough Brooklyn childhood served him well in prison. \u201cI was good with my fists,\u201d he said. \u201cThey left me alone.\u201d\n\nAs he recalled his time in Charles Street, the garrulous Baird grew silent. Then he said, \u201cThey gave us tin cups to rattle on the bars of our doors to call a guard if you were being attacked or ill.\u201d He paused. \u201cAll these years later I can still hear that sound, that rattle for help in the night.\u201d\n\nAs Baird brooded over his prospects in his cell, where rats crawled in corners and bugs lurked in his food, he gradually elected to go for broke, and launch a series of legal appeals in the hopes of bringing a test case before the U.S. Supreme Court. \u201cI had about a 98 percent chance of being rejected by the Supreme Court and a two percent chance of being heard, but I thought I had to try,\u201d he said. He hoped that a precedent had been set by a landmark Planned Parenthood case two years before, Griswold v. Connecticut, in which the Supreme Court struck down an arcane Connecticut law barring the dissemination of contraceptive information or devices, saying it denied the right of privacy\u2014but only to married couples.\n\nBaird\u2019s case was riskier, pushing against religious \u201cmorality\u201d standards for unmarried women. Eisenstadt v. Baird was finally heard by the Supreme Court in 1972. Justice William J. Brennan\u2019s legendary wording in overturning the law was crucial: \u201cIf the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted government intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as to the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\u201d That precise language\u2014to bear or beget\u2014led directly to Roe ten months later. Eisenstadt was cited five times in that majority opinion.\n\nBaird, who never studied law, has two other Supreme Court victories bearing his name: Baird v. Bellotti I (1976) and Baird v. Bellotti II (1979), which gave minors the right to abortion without parental consent. (These decisions have since been largely eroded by state laws.) Eisenstadt has also been cited in more than 52 Supreme Court cases from 1972 through 2002. All eleven U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals, as well as the Federal Circuit, have cited Eisenstadt as authority. In this century, Eisenstadt was again cited in Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage.\n\n", "description": "What Bill Baird's aggressive, often illegal form of activism can teach a new generation about combating anti-abortion forces.", "authors": ["Myra Macpherson"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/a501243a56738a51ce1a530c91a9f9a434575600.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
