The authors expect two more Pacific nations, the Solomon Islands and Kiribati, will take loans with Beijing, as both recently announced a switch in diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China.\n\nOf the six Pacific governments that owe money to China, the report found China has become the single largest lender to Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu.\n\n\"'[They] appear to be among those most heavily indebted to China anywhere in the world,\" Mr Rajah and his co-authors Jonathan Pryke and Alexandre Dayant found in Oceans of Debt? Belt and Road and the Debt Diplomacy in the Pacific.\n\nThe authors argued the sheer scale of China\u2019s lending meant it should adopt multilateral development bank lending rules and \"require the provision of concessional financing to countries at greater risk of debt distress.\"\n\nModelling from the research shows four of the six countries that borrow from China \u2014 Vanuatu, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji \u2014 are already effectively at a warning threshold and, with the exception of Fiji, are likely to be pushed into unsustainable debt.\n\n\"Vanuatu stands out as a particular concern...while Papua New Guinea would also see a dramatic increase in debt beyond our warnings threshold,\" the report found.\n\nDespite China's expanding presence in the region and the vast nature of the Belt and Road Initiative, the report's analysis shows China was not the dominant creditor in the Pacific.\n\n\"China was responsible for 37 per cent of all official sector loans disbursed to the region in 2011\u20132017. The Asian Development Bank provided a slightly higher share, at 41 per cent.\"\n\nChina's increased presence has prompted the Australian government to respond with its own new debt-financing initiatives as part of its broader Pacific \u2018step-up,' but the authors caution that if Australia wants a stronger presence in the Pacific, it should reverse the current stagnation in its overall aid budget.", "description": "The claim that China has engaged in \"debt-trap diplomacy\" has been hosed down in a new Lowy Institute report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_5.3214%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_383/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a83e6319e21f9667f3a13f6c475bc6e57e465044", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
