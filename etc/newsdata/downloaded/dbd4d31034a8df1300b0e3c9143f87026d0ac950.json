(AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis)\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Organizers of a Vatican meeting on the Amazon defended plans to introduce debate on married priests, saying Thursday the proposal represents the \u201cthe voice of the local church\u201d and isn\u2019t an official proposal of the pope.\n\nCardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri acknowledged the Oct. 6-27 synod on the Amazon has generated criticism, including from cardinals who have accused organizers of making \u201cheretical\u201d proposals in the working document.\n\nBaldisseri told a news conference that such \u201cfreedom of expression\u201d was allowed. But he stressed that the working document would be replaced by a final one voted on by Amazonian bishops, and was merely a summary of two years of listening to the Amazonian faithful.\n\nPope Francis, history\u2019s first Latin American pope, called the meeting in 2017 to address the ecological, social and spiritual needs of indigenous peoples in the Amazon, where poverty is rampant, isolation hinders the church\u2019s ministry and rapid deforestation is threatening the environment.\n\nThe most controversial proposal in the synod\u2019s working document calls for Amazonian bishops to study whether older married men who are respected by their communities might be ordained to help address a shortage of priests that is so acute that the faithful can go months without having a proper Mass.\n\nWhile such a proposal to ordain \u201cviri probati,\u201d or \u201cmen of proven virtue\u201d has been around for decades, the Amazon meeting has brought it to the fore given Francis has said he is open to studying an exception to priestly celibacy for a particular location out of \u201cpastoral necessity.\u201d\n\nCardinal Claudio Hummes, the retired archbishop of Sao Paolo and the main organizer of the Amazon meeting, defended the proposal as the fruit of two years of listening to some 80,000 people from the region.\n\n\u201cIt is the voice of the local church,\u201d he said of the working document.\n\nHummes said the lack of access to the sacraments for the faithful due to the priest shortage was gravely harming the church\u2019s ministry in the Amazon. \u201cThe Eucharist builds the church,\u201d he said, quoting St. John Paul II.\n\nBaldisseri was also defensive when responding to questions about whether religious sisters would be allowed to vote on the synod\u2019s final document. Sisters and Catholic women\u2019s groups have demanded nuns be allowed to vote, especially at a synod for a region where women perform the lion\u2019s share of the church\u2019s work.\n\nBaldisseri noted that more women are participating in this synod _ 35 female experts and nuns against 184 synod fathers _ than any previous one. And he acknowledged that in the past Francis had made an exception in allowing lay brothers _ not priests _ who were religious superiors of their orders to vote.\n\nBut he stressed that current Vatican norms reserve voting rights to priests and bishops. \u201cI think we must stick with the norms, and the interpretation of these norms rests with the Holy Father,\u201d he said.", "description": "Organizers of a Vatican meeting on the Amazon defended plans to introduce debate on married priests, saying Thursday the proposal represents the \u201cthe voice of the local church\u201d and isn\u2019t an official proposal of the pope.
