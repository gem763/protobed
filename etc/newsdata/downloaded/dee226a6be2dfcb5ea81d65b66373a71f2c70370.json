I\u2019m saying this now a year out. They can\u2019t be at the convention,\u201d the comedian continued. \u201cMaybe on the video waving or something, but I\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\nMr. Maher subsequently cited Rep. Justin Amash, Michigan independent, who recently called Mrs. Clinton an \u201casset\u201d to Republicans and President Trump re-election campaign.\n\n\u201cShe is,\u201d Mr. Maher agreed. \u201cAnd Bill is damaged goods. \u201cI just think they got to go away.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton unsuccessfully campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. She was named the party\u2019s candidate in 2016 but was defeated at the polls by Mr. Trump.\n\nShe is not currently among the more than a dozen candidates currently seeking the Democratic nomination in 2020. Mr. Trump recently said she should reconsider, however.\n\n\u201cI think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter earlier this month, referring to the Democratic senator for Massachusetts running for president.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
