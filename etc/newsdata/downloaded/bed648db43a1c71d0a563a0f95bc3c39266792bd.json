The former Texas congressman has since loudly called for a mandatory gun buyback of certain types semiautomatic weapons.\n\n\u201cThis moment, which will define us forever, which will decide so much \u2014 not just for those who are alive today, but every generation that follows \u2014 calls upon every single one of us to decide that things don\u2019t just happen to us,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told the crowd of about 250 people, which included some survivors of the fatal 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting and 1999 Columbine High School shooting.\n\n\u201cThat we have a chance together, in a government of, by, and for the people,\u201d O\u2019Rourke continued, \u201cto decide the future of this country on an issue like gun violence.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s event took place on the steps of the Aurora Municipal Center across the road from the 7/20 memorial garden, built to remember the survivors and victims of the Aurora theater shooting, which left 12 dead and 70 wounded.\n\nTom Sullivan, the father of one of the theater victims, introduced O\u2019Rourke at the event.\n\nSullivan ran for state house as a Democrat in 2018, winning a seat in a heavily Republican district while vowing to pass gun control. The representative went on to lead the passage of a \u201cred flag\u201d bill in Colorado this session, an achievement that prompted Republicans to try to have him recalled. (The recall effort flopped).\n\n\u201cWe are in the middle of a public health crisis,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s one I didn\u2019t know about until my son Alex was murdered along with 11 others, just down the street.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mass shootings have continued,\u201d he added, \u201csome would say they\u2019ve even become more frequent.\u201d\n\nMany attendees credited O\u2019Rourke for taking a stand, with some citing it as a reason they favor the congressman in a crowded primary field.\n\nTim Garcia, an 82-year-old retired Army veteran and Colorado native, said he appreciated O\u2019Rourke\u2019s seeming intransigence even when others invariably get mad about potentially having to give up weapons of war.\n\n\u201c[I spent] 17 years in the Army,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI used plenty of weapons. I know what they can do. And this is why I really\u2026 [support] him.\n\n\u201cI was always for the underdog,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nobody that\u2019s more of an underdog than someone who\u2019s afraid to go out because they\u2019re afraid somebody is going to shoot them.\u201d\n\nFor Jennifer Tokarz, a 44-year-old accountant who brought along her 10-year-old daughter for both of their first-ever political rallies, the stakes of inaction on gun violence is personal.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 16 my best friend was shot and killed by her ex-boyfriend who was jealous, in front of me, and that has stayed with me for 28 years,\u201d she said, \u201cand that takes an emotional toll on you.\u201d\n\nShe said those 28 years of political inaction have pushed her to pay more attention to O\u2019Rourke, whom she credited for being \u201cblunt and honest and genuine.\u201d\n\nNot all supported the idea of a gun buyback. One woman, who identified herself as a mother of four, drove three-and-a half hours from the western Colorado town of Rifle to tell O\u2019Rourke \u201chell no\u201d he couldn\u2019t have her guns.\n\n(1/2) A woman says she drove more than three hours to challenge O'Rourke on his assault weapons ban.\n\n\n\n\"Hell no, you're not.\"\n\n\n\nShe added that she was carrying her handgun with her and commented on O'Rourke's history of a DUI.\n\n\n\nO'Rourke insisted that the crowd let her finish. pic.twitter.com/fVezZE7VDS \u2014 Jeffrey Cook (@JeffreyCook) September 20, 2019\n\nShe asked during a Q&A with the candidate how he instead plans to \u201clegislate evil, because it\u2019s not the gun \u2015 it is the heart of the man that does that.\u201d\n\nAfter repeatedly asking the crowd to stifle their boos, O\u2019Rourke responded: \u201cThere\u2019s this presumption that we\u2019re just inherently evil, because you asked how we\u2019re going to legislate this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI refuse to accept that,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen in any other country. There are 329 million of us. There are 390 million guns. No other country allows its citizens to buy weapons that were designed for war and you probably know this as well as I do.\u201d", "description": "Tom Sullivan, the father of one of the 2012 theater shooting victims, introduced the Democratic presidential candidate at a rally on Thursday.", "authors": ["National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8433cc2100003000e455c3.jpeg?cache=5hbk0nayjl&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
