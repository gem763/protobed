The hearing room erupted when Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., challenged his account, in starkly personal terms.\n\nTOM HOMAN SAYS HE WARNED FLORES AGREEMENT WOULD LEAD TO SURGE IN FAMILY UNITS AT BORDER\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to really make sure that the jingoistic, bigoted testimony of Mr. Homan is called out as nearly completely untrue, as being an outrage, and as a former official directing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, he should know better,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat did I say was inaccurate?\u201d Homan shot back, as Chairman Jamie Raskin, D-Md., intervened to restore order.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s important that it\u2019s not accepted as accurate testimony.\u201d She went on to question other witnesses on the panel, but did not ask anything of Homan.\n\nHoman, who is a Fox News contributor, finally responded to Wasserman-Schultz when Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, had his turn. After responding to one of Jordan\u2019s questions, Homan turned his attention to the Florida Democrat, who used to lead the Democratic National Committee.\n\n\u201cIf I can respond to the earlier remark from Wasserman Schultz, I\u2019ve forgotten more about this issue than you\u2019ll ever know,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you say my testimony is inaccurate, it\u2019s wrong. Everything I said here is accurate. Bottom line. If you want to go toe to toe, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here on my own time to speak to the American people about what\u2019s false and what\u2019s fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to go toe to toe with you Mr. Homan,\u201d Wasserman Schultz responded. \u201cI\u2019m happy to do that any day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you gotta let me respond to your question rather than dropping a bomb and running away,\u201d Homan fired back, to which Wasserman Schultz said, \u201cIt was my time.\u201d\n\nCBP LEADER INSISTS BORDER AGENCY DID NOT VIOLATE LAW OVER MIGRANT DETAINEE DNA\n\nHoman\u2019s defense of the Trump administration was that while Democrats are claiming the medical deferred action program is going away, the only change is that decisions on who gets deferred action are now being made by ICE instead of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is not a law enforcement agency.\n\n\u201cIt is not lawful to have a deferred action program at any federal agency,\u201d he said during his opening remarks. He clarified that deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion that had to be made on a \u201ccase by case basis\u201d and \u201ceven then only by the relevant prosecution agency \u2026 that has the statutory authority over those laws.\u201d He said it was untrue that the administration was getting rid of medical deferred action entirely.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help to have a mixed message that all of a sudden deferred action is going away,\u201d he said later on. \u201cICE doesn\u2019t put their heart on a shelf when they wear the badge and gun and all of a sudden don\u2019t care about humanity. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s a ridiculous false narrative, and I\u2019m going to be here 'till the day I die defending the men and women of the Border Patrol and ICE who put it on the line defending this country.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPrior to the hearing, Homan appeared on Fox News claiming that Democrats were taking what was happening \u201cout of context \u2026 to raise hatred against the administration,\u201d and that he was going to defend his former agency.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going there to look for a fight, but I\u2019m not going to run away from one either,\u201d he said.", "description": "Former ICE director Tom Homan appeared before a House subcommittee Wednesday\u00a0ready for a fight\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and he got one.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Shultz-Homan-Getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
