They also cut their view for growth next year to 1.1% from 1.8%. The DIW, Ifo Institute, IfW, IWH and RWI cited falling world-wide demand for capital goods as well as political uncertainty and structural changes in the automotive industry for the downgrade.\n\n\"The global manufacturing recession is global, in that it includes the U.S. Some of it comes from China, and some of it comes the White House but it's pretty global and while Germany is suffering worse than anyone else, even the U.S. is feeling it,\" said Kit Juckes, global fixed income strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\nAmong the few risers was Grenke (GLJ.XE), up 6% as the financing firm raised its full-year new-business forecast and reported increasing margins.\n\nFlutter Entertainment shot up 18% as the bookmaker announced it will buy Canada's The Stars Group (TSGI.T) in a stock swap in which it will control nearly 55% of the combined company. Flutter said the deal will lift underlying earnings per share by at least 50% in the first full year following completion, and its combined revenue of GBP3.8 billion will make it the largest online betting and gaming operator.\n\nTesco (TSCO.LN) rose 1% after the supermarket group announced a first-half rise in pretax profit and the departure of its chief executive.
