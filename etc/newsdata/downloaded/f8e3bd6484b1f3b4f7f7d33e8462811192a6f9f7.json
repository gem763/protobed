The president has always preferred to run his White House with a team-of-rivals approach, with aides fighting over various policies or political options and Trump alone as the decider at the center of the action.\n\nThe impeachment battle may be no different.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\n\u201cHave all of these geniuses been able to get this done for him? No, he gets it done for himself,\u201d a former senior administration official said of the president\u2019s approach to management.\n\nThe former official said Trump is currently discussing his options with his family, aides and outside advisers, while another person close to the White House called it a \u201cdisorganized mess.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed all of the jockeying as irrelevant. \u201cThe president has done nothing wrong and has been transparent throughout this entire process \u2014 that will not change,\u201d she said. \u201cWe refuse to let partisan games and the media\u2019s hysteria take away from President Trump and his administration\u2019s work on behalf of the American people. There is much to be done for this country and that is what we are focused on.\u201d\n\nTrump appears to prefer acting as his own political strategist and communications director, even for the upcoming impeachment fight centering around his alleged attempt to persuade Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate potential 2020 rival Joe Biden. He has spent the past several days speaking directly to reporters or prolifically tweeting about \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d or Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, all while trying to discredit the whistleblower whose complaint kicked off the investigation into his phone call with the Ukrainian president.\n\nTrump spent Monday morning threatening Schiff with arrest for treason, while he spent the afternoon talking about unmasking the identity of the whistleblower whose actions and anonymity are protected under federal law.\n\n\u201cWe're trying to find out about a whistleblower. We have a whistleblower that reports things that were incorrect,\u201d Trump said Monday in the Oval Office during the swearing in of his new labor secretary, even though much of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint tracks with the summary of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president released by the White House last week.\n\nThe Trump team\u2019s strategic calculation to beat back impeachment appears to center primarily on holding on to the support of Republicans. If there is a Senate trial, the White House cannot afford to lose more than 20 Republicans \u2014 provided all of the Democrats stand together on a conviction and his removal from office.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/895/1155968404_6090747453001_6090743461001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nThat\u2019s a very different move compared with the special counsel investigation by Robert Mueller, whose authority extended to being able to charge Trump aides with crimes but who had no power to make a direct referral to Congress on impeachment.\n\nSeveral White House aides and Trump allies spent Monday downplaying the threat of impeachment by saying the Democrats\u2019 inquiry had only just begun or by playing up all of the policy discussions happening inside the administration. Other top Trump officials and outside advisers have dismissed the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as political theater.\n\n\"We won the Mueller probe. We're going to win this one. Here we go! I tell you what. If Mueller was a war, this is a skirmish,\u201d Jay Sekulow, one of the president\u2019s outside lawyers, said on his radio show Monday.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House already has many of the mechanisms in place to battle impeachment. One White House official has said no additional hires are expected for handling the Democrats\u2019 inquiry.\n\nIn the White House counsel\u2019s office, Pat Cipollone started his tenure late last year by tapping Michael Purpura to lead a team of about 20 attorneys to handle Democratic oversight requests. Purpura and another White House deputy, Patrick Philbin, a veteran of the George W. Bush Justice Department, has made the transition into impeachment matters. Both lawyers personally attended former Trump 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski\u2019s appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, along with DOJ Office of Legal Counsel attorney Curtis Gannon.\n\nTrump\u2019s private attorneys also remain a key part of the action. There\u2019s Sekulow, the chief counsel at the conservative nonprofit American Center for Law & Justice, who brings to the table his own team of lawyers.\n\nThat group includes Sekulow\u2019s son, Jordan Sekulow, as well as Stuart Roth, the elder Sekulow\u2019s longtime legal partner and a Mercer University law school classmate; former federal prosecutor and Georgia state attorney Andrew Ekonomou; and ACLJ senior counsel Benjamin Sisney.\n\nOn Friday, Jordan Sekulow leaned into the impending fight on his father\u2019s radio show with a prediction that the House will impeach Trump.\n\n\"Yeah, I said it, he\u2019s going to be impeached by the House of Representatives,\u201d the younger Sekulow said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any way around that at this point in time unless you have some shifts for some reason we can\u2019t foresee right now. Now, he's not going to be removed. But he'll be impeached by the House.\u201d\n\nThe most outspoken member of the president\u2019s team, Rudy Giuliani, continues to represent Trump as a personal lawyer and now finds himself in the middle of the House investigation. On Monday, a trio of House committees subpoenaed Giuliani for a raft of documents tied to his Ukraine outreach and gave an Oct. 15 deadline.\n\nCentral to the outreach on Capitol Hill is Eric Ueland, director of legislative affairs for the White House and a former chief of staff to then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, who is steeped in Congress\u2019 arcane procedure. Jeff Freeland, a deputy and ally of Mulvaney\u2019s West Wing team, handles day-to-day House operations and had a front-row seat during the Judiciary Committee\u2019s raucous Lewandowski hearing.\n\nOne notable member of Trump\u2019s battle plan: The president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is expected to continue to give the president advice on impeachment privately, regardless of the way the West Wing structures any formal response.\n\nDisorganized or not, many White House aides and allies are maintaining outward confidence that the impeachment inquiry will excite the Republican base and give the party the chance not just to win reelection in 2020 \u2014 but to reclaim the majority in the House.\n\nThe White House\u2019s major impediment, said the former senior administration officials, is further revelations that officials cannot anticipate like other calls the president had with foreign leaders, or the path the Democrats\u2019 own inquiry takes.\n\nDaniel Lippman contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d3/8b/1b5c6d8345589831d6063bf7764a/20190930-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
