Earlier Tuesday, UFC president Dana White revealed that Costa is out for the foreseeable after having surgery.\n\n\u201cHe had surgery on his bicep, so he\u2019s out for eight months,\u201d White said. \u201cBut we are working on something else with Israel right now.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night, Adesanya revealed on Twitter what that \u201csomething else\u201d is. Adesanya tweeted a screengrab of a conversation with his coach, Eugene Bareman, dated Oct. 17 in which they agree that former title challenger Yoel Romero should be next with Costa out.\n\nAdesanya\u2019s tweet included Romero\u2019s Twitter handle and his signature #iseeyousoonboi hashtag.\n\nYou guys just finding out shit we been knowing for weeks and plotting on for months! #staywoke #iseeyousoonboi @YoelRomeroMMA pic.twitter.com/UQizrmv9sa \u2014 Israel Adesanya (@stylebender) October 30, 2019\n\nYou guys just finding out shit we been knowing for weeks and plotting on for months! #staywoke #iseeyousoonboi @YoelRomeroMMA\n\nDuring UFC 243 fight week, Adesanya (18-0 MMA, 7-0 UFC) took a shot at Romero (13-4 MMA, 9-3 UFC) while discussing his two losses to Whittaker. Those comments came months after Adesanya went off on Twitter in May after fans voiced their support for Romero.\n\nRomero, 42, is currently ranked No. 4 in the USA TODAY Sports/MMA Junkie middleweight rankings. He\u2019s coming off two losses in a row for the first time in his career after dropping a hard-fought unanimous decision to Costa in August at UFC 241.", "description": "In the wake of derailed plans, UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya is calling his shot.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Simon Samano", "Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/israel-adesanya-ufc-234-3.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
