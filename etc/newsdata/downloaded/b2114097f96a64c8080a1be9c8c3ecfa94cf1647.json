Although the rally was illegal, it began peacefully.\n\nWhat caused Sunday's clashes?\n\nThe anger of the crowd was partly fuelled by an attack on pro-democracy leader Jimmy Sham earlier this week which left him in hospital. He was set upon by five men with hammers in the Mong Kok district of Kowloon.\n\nOn Saturday, another man who was reportedly handing out pro-democracy flyers was stabbed.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nNumbers attending protests have dropped from their peak. The movement has seen hundreds of thousands taking part in demonstrations on several occasions.\n\n\"The government are now refusing to authorise any peaceful protest,\" a demonstrator named Avery said on Sunday. \"That means anyone who comes out will inherently be breaking the law. So that's the tactic the Hong Kong government is using.\"\n\nIs there any solution in sight?\n\nOriginally, the protests were prompted by outrage at a new law that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China.\n\nPeople in Hong Kong are fiercely protective of their legal system and enhanced personal rights, which are governed under an arrangement known as \"one country, two systems\".\n\nBut they have grown increasingly concerned that China seeks greater control.\n\nThe extradition bill was eventually scrapped but the protest movement has broadened to include four other demands:\n\nFor the protests not to be characterised as a \"riot\"\n\nAmnesty for arrested protesters\n\nAn independent inquiry into alleged police brutality\n\nImplementation of complete universal suffrage\n\nHong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam is seen by many pro-democracy campaigners as a mouthpiece for Beijing \u2013 something she fiercely denies.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch the moment chaos erupts in Hong Kong parliament on Wednesday\n\nMs Lam was forced to abandon her major annual speech in parliament this week after opposition lawmakers heckled her, brandishing banners and shouting slogans.\n\nHer speech, calling for an end to the protests, eventually had to be delivered by pre-recorded video.\n\nUS lawmakers, meanwhile, have backed the pro-democracy movement by passing a bill in the House of Representatives supporting them.\n\nAmerican companies, including video game firm Blizzard and the National Basketball Association, have also found themselves embroiled in the political crisis.", "description": "Thousands take part in a banned march that turns violent as hardcore protesters clash with police.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17138/production/_109302549_2019-10-20t095341z_1152403004_rc172d8050b0_rtrmadp_3_hongkong-protests-2ce038c52e0e0d4e104bfdca92239f46041dcb8c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
