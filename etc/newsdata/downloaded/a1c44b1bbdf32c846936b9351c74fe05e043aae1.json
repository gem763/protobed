However, senators took aim at YouTube for facilitating a much less surreptitious form of Russian propaganda.\n\n\"YouTube continues to be the propaganda vehicle of choice for Russia's state-sponsored news organization, RT (formerly Russia Today). As of February 2019, RT had nearly 3.3 million global subscribers on its YouTube channel,\" the report says.\n\nAt time of writing, RT's YouTube channel has over 3.7 million subscribers.\n\nThe report also accused Google's search engine of elevating disinformation and extremist content, and gave an example. \"Days after the 2016 presidential election, a falsified media account of President-elect Donald Trump having won the popular vote briefly ranked higher than stories that accurately reflected the US popular vote result,\" the report says.\n\nTrump's rival in 2016, Hillary Clinton, in fact won the popular vote.\n\nThus far Google has managed to escape largely unscathed by questions of Russian state interference, which have centered more on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter where Russian trolls can create millions of fake accounts. In November 2017 Google's then-general counsel Kent Walker told senators, \"Google's products didn't lend themselves to the kind of micro-targeting or viral dissemination that these actors seemed to prefer.\"\n\nAnd last December, Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the state-sponsored bot networks could manipulate YouTube by downvoting videos or flooding them with negative comments. Pichai said Google had sophisticated tools to detect this kind of activity.\n\nThe report asked President Trump to condemn foreign interference in American elections, and comes just days after Trump called on Ukraine and China to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\n\"We've invested significantly to detect phishing and hacking attempts, identify foreign interference, and protect campaigns from digital attacks. We'll continue this work and will keep sharing information with law enforcement and industry,\" a YouTube spokeswoman told Business Insider.", "description": "The US Senate Intelligence Committee published a report on Russian election interference on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d5bffc0cd978453d028051c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
