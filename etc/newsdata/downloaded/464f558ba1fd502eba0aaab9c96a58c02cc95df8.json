Exit polls indicated he won more than 76 percent of the vote. (Lorenzo Tugnoli/For The Washington Post)\n\nIn a region ruled by monarchs, autocrats and family dynasties, Tunisia on Sunday once again showcased its unique position in the Arab world: It will soon have a president who is a political outsider \u2014 either a media tycoon or a former law professor.\n\nIn the only nation to emerge from the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings as a democracy, millions headed to the polls Sunday to vote in the runoff of its second-ever presidential elections. In doing so, they showed contempt for the nation\u2019s political establishment for failing to solve high unemployment, rising prices and lack of opportunities that helped spark the revolution.\n\nNow, a disillusioned population has placed its hopes on two diametrically opposite candidates. Either Nabil Karoui, a multimillionaire TV station owner who campaigned from a prison cell, or Kais Saied, an obscure academic who hardly campaigned and had to borrow money to register as candidate, will be Tunisia\u2019s next president.\n\n\u201cI am fed up with the political system,\u201d said Najwa Sassi, 45, an employee in a pharmaceutical lab who voted in Tunis\u2019s upscale enclave of Les Berges du Lac. \u201cBut I never expected that we would elect a political outsider. This makes me proud of our democracy.\u201d\n\nExit polls on Sunday indicated Saied had secured more than 76 percent of the vote. Official results were expected as early as Monday.\n\nOn the streets of the capital, Tunisians honked their car horns in celebration. Thousands gathered on Avenue Habib Bourguiba, the epicenter of the 2011 revolution, chanted Saied\u2019s name and waved Tunisian flags.\n\n\n\nPresidential candidate Nabil Karoui walks to a polling station in Tunis. (Lorenzo Tugnoli/For The Washington Post)\n\n[Tunisia, the Arab Spring\u2019s sole democracy, chooses a new president]\n\nIn some ways, analysts said, this North African nation has embraced political trends seen in other countries, where populist movements have toppled the established political parties, said analysts.\n\n\u201cElectorates are looking to new faces, and sometimes new faces with untested ideas,\u201d said Scott Mastic, a senior official with the International Republican Institute, which with the National Democratic Institute, is observing the elections. \u201cAnd in that sense the dynamic here in Tunisia is more similar to things we see in Europe than some other places in this region.\u201d\n\nYet unlike Europe, where populism has been fueled by anti-migrant sentiment and race- or religion-based politics, both Karoui and Saied have vowed to uproot poverty, battle corruption and build a better government that can provide health care, education and other basic needs. That in itself stands in stark contrast to elections in other parts of the Arab world, which are typically rigged, and where populations have no real voice.\n\n\u201cWe Tunisians are angry at the previous president and governments,\u201d said Saoussen Attia, 35, who works at a water supply company, after leaving a polling station. \u201cThey failed us. Today, our dinar is collapsing and corruption is everywhere. Young people like me want a Tunisia that looks like the United States or France.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Tunisian voter casts her ballot at a polling station inside a school in Tunis. (Lorenzo Tugnoli/For The Washington Post)\n\nSaied and Karoui placed first and second in the presidential election last month contested by 26 candidates. The field included moderate Islamists, secularists and even supporters of Tunisia\u2019s late dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who was toppled in the revolution and died last month in exile in Saudi Arabia. The election came less than two months after the death of 92-year-old President Beji Caid Essebsi, who was elected in 2014.\n\n[As Tunisia embraces democracy, its late dictator still casts a shadow]\n\nThe campaigns of both Saied and Karoui were unorthodox. The day before the start of Karoui\u2019s campaign in August, he was arrested on three-year-old allegations of tax fraud and money laundering, charges his supporters say were politically motivated. International observers raised concerns about the timing of his arrest, given that the 56-year-old media mogul was leading in the polls.\n\nKaroui campaigned from prison, portraying himself as a populist champion of the poor and for those neglected by the political establishment. His brash style and business-minded image evoked comparisons to President Trump and former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Karoui was released from prison last Wednesday, but the charges against him still stand.\n\n\u201cKaroui has an economic program, and he\u2019s a lot like me,\u201d Attia said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the charges against him.\u201d\n\nThe 61-year-old Saied, in contrast, is not affiliated with a political party. While his competitors put up billboards and staged large rallies with music, he campaigned largely by speaking to voters on their doorsteps.\n\nTall and solemn, he has drawn the nickname \u201cRobot Man\u201d for his stiff manner. He is seen as deeply conservative \u2014 he has referred to homosexuality \u201cas an illness and foreign plot.\u201d At the same time, he has appealed to voters by promising a government that will return power back to the people.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want someone who was just released from prison,\u201d said Mohamed Abidi, 40, a lawyer. \u201cKais Saied connects with the people.\u201d\n\nWhoever wins the elections will immediately face challenges. In last week\u2019s parliamentary elections, the moderate Islamist Ennahda Party won the most seats, but not a majority. Other parties, including Karoui\u2019s fledgling party, have also gained significant numbers of seats, making it potentially difficult to create a government.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at a very fractured political reality in the parliament,\u201d Mastic said. \u201cIt will take a lot of work to form a governing coalition whatever that looks like and whomever is the president.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Nabil Karoui and Kais Saied are anti-establishment candidates that disillusioned Tunisians hope will bring change to the sole democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring uprisings.", "authors": ["Sudarsan Raghavan", "Cairo Bureau Chief Covering North Africa", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Bc2vLObwpjd1isxv3SYWj-bVYuA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3RJRAPXN2UI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
