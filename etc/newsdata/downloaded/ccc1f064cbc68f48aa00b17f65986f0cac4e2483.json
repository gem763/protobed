I don't want to get in a word sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke. And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.\"\n\nRead more: LeBron James says he doesn't think Daryl Morey was 'educated' before sending pro-Hong Kong tweet, says there are ramifications to free speech\n\nJames caught criticism from fans, many of whom were disappointed that James had decided against standing with Morey and in support of the ongoing protests.\n\nOn Tuesday, AP photographer Mark Schiefelbein captured images of protesters in Hong Kong burning James' jersey.
