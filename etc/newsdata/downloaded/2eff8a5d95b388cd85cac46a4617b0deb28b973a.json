Giant penguins, of course", "language": "en", "text": "Plus, giant sharks, otters, sloths and dragonflies\n\nCan you imagine a world where penguins are as tall as you?\n\nThis summer, scientists reported on the discovery of a monster penguin fossil in a New Zealand riverbed.\n\nThe huge prehistoric penguin weighed about 176 pounds \u2014 that\u2019s about the same as a dishwasher \u2014 and, at five feet three inches, it was about as tall as a human.\n\nThanks to this discovery, scientists have slowly been piecing together the story of these giant birds.\n\nThe good old days\n\nAbout 60 million years ago, after ocean dinosaurs went extinct, the sea was a much safer place.\n\nMarine reptiles no longer dominated, so there was lots of food around, and birds like penguins had room to evolve and grow.\n\nEventually, penguins morphed into tall, waddling predators.\n\nIn other words, they were at the top of their game.\n\nA fossilized ankle from a giant penguin, left, compared to a similar bone from the largest living penguin: an emperor penguin. (Mark Baker/The Associated Press)\n\nBye bye birdies\n\nBut the glory days didn\u2019t last.\n\nAfter 30 million years, the giant penguins were gone.\n\nGerald Mayr, a paleontologist who studies these birds, suggests this is because of the rise of marine mammals like toothed whales, walruses, sea lions and seals.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the marine mammals both preyed on the penguins and competed with them for food and breeding territory, which eventually drove the mega-birds to extinction.\n\nA mystery\n\nBut consider this: Why did penguins, who once thrived as giants, evolve into the small, waddling birds we are familiar with today?\n\nDid they need to be smaller and faster in order to avoid predators?\n\nOr could they not find enough prey to sustain their large bodies once they were forced to compete?\n\nIt\u2019s a mystery concerning not just penguins, but also other prehistoric giants.\n\nMegalodon\n\nTake the megalodon, for example.\n\nWith a name meaning giant tooth and a length of almost 60 feet, the megalodon was the largest fish to ever swim the oceans.\n\nAnd though sensationalized by the media and Hollywood, don\u2019t get too worried \u2014 megalodon is definitely extinct.\n\nBut while you might have expected that sharks would have a big, scary ancestor, would you expect the same of otters, sloths and dragonflies?\n\nEarly otters looked a lot like today\u2019s river otters, except for the fact that they were the size of a wolf and weighed almost as much as one, too.\n\nSome prehistoric dragonflies had wingspans that were two to three feet across.\n\nAnd giant ground sloths were roughly the size of elephants!\n\nYet all of these giants met similar sticky ends: outcompeted by other animals, killed by a changing atmosphere and possibly even \u2014 in the case of the supersized sloths \u2014 being over-hunted by early humans.\n\nWhatever the case, discoveries like that of the giant penguin fossil in New Zealand are filling in our understanding of prehistoric life.\n\nNot to mention providing inspiration for your next Halloween costume!", "description": "CBC Kids News contributor Quinn Murphy on what we can learn from a monster penguin fossil, as well as other giant prehistoric creatures.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/GiantAnimals_thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
