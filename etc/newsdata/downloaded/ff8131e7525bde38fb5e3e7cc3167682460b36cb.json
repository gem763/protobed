It counts agencies such as Ray White, LJ Hooker and Barry Plant among its users and, in the US, it has won Sotheby's International Realty as a client.\n\n\"We can say 'here are the top five people we think will list their home,'\" Mr Farrugia said.\n\n\"Based on the way consumers consume the content, we can predict their intent. Based on five or six interactions, we can tell an agent if someone is behaving like an upsizer, a downsizer, a seller or if they could be the likely buyer of a certain home.\"\n\nAfter leaving school Mr Farrugia became a motor mechanic, starting his own automotive business LPGAS1 before selling it in late 2007.\n\nAfter he then started investing in the tech industry, he said he realised he wanted to build a globally scalable business.\n\nHe came up with the idea for ActivePipe while developing a portfolio of investment properties, where he said there was a clear lack of communication across the real estate industry.\n\nHis co-founder, Mr Stewart, similarly had no direct experience in technology, but sold his own transport business to Toll in 2007.\n\nIn the last year ActivePipe claims to have generated 17,000 listing appointments for real estate agents, as well as funnelling 19.6 million hits to its clients' websites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Farrugia said he was confident the business would triple the size of its US business in the next 12 months.\n\n\"In the US the go-to-market is to find influential brokerages in the network who will make the noise and get us meetings with corporates,\" he said.\n\n\"The NAR is the largest trade association in America with 1.3 million members and we took part it its Reach accelerator program in 2018. Having the US trade association as an investor is valuable.\"\n\nThe NAR, which was also an early investor in DocuSign, backed the business via its Second Century Ventures fund. NAR boss Bob Goldberg said he had witnessed the enthusiasm of US brokerages for the ActivePipe platform.\n\n\"With the successes already beginning to add up, we believe ActivePipe has the potential to become a critical component of the technology revolution underway within real estate brokerages in the US,\" he said.\n\nThe company expects the new investors to flip to equity investors in the Series B raise. This is expected to be upwards of $10 million, but the size is still being determined.\n\nOne of the next chapters for the company will be to expand its underlying platform into new sectors, with IAG and NAB interested in its potential applications in the insurance and mortgage broking fields.\n\n\"We're in the early stages of looking at commercial opportunities with IAG,\" Mr Farrugia said. \"Insurance has been something on our radar as a vertical that needs attention just like real estate.\"", "description": "ActivePipe is an automated system that lets real estate agents predict who will buy and sell, it has started picking up business, as well as investment, in the US.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4106%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_627%2C$y_257/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fd54bd5299003baa20af154119b12e336aa556c0", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
