My worst nightmare,\u2019 one fan wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u2018I really hated that shower scene, it always gets me,\u2019 another tweeted.\n\n\u2018No, not another shower scene,\u2019 another said.\n\n\u2018Not that shower scene from The Grudge, please anything but that,\u2019 one concerned fan stated.\n\nDirector Nicolas previously revealed that the new movie opens up a \u2018new chapter\u2019 in the Grudge universe, as opposed to being another remake.\n\n\u2018The beauty of The Grudge franchise, both the American and Japanese iterations, is it\u2019s an anthology series,\u2019 he told Entertainment Weekly. \u2018Every movie is a different story of different characters having different interactions with this curse.\n\n\u2018In today\u2019s age where we\u2019re remaking everything, I thought it would be fun to dive into The Grudge universe where we don\u2019t have to remake anything, but rather a new chapter in this canon.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that the movie is set to take place concurrently with the timeline of the 2004 adaptation, with the stories \u2018interweaving\u2019.\n\n\u2018Like the old films, it\u2019s a tapestry of three different stories that interweave and all take place at slightly different times, centered around this one house that\u2019s at the centre of this case that this cop [Andrea Riseboroough] is working on.\u2019\n\nThe Grudge will be released to cinemas on 31 January 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
