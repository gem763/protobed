We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nDorsey admitted in a series of tweets that political advertising can skew the conversation away from organic discussion, though his declaration that \u201cwe believe this decision should not be compromised by money\u201d belied years of taking money for exactly that skewing.\n\nWow. Big move by @jack, and a bigger contrast to @Facebook's increasingly problematic policy positions. https://t.co/nm9rckaKHc \u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) October 30, 2019\n\nJack is subtweeting Zuck lol https://t.co/emW6MnOobn \u2014 Kill-y Ellis \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b (@justkelly_ok) October 30, 2019\n\nThe new policy is not set in stone yet - Twitter plans to share it by November 15, while enforcement will begin a week from then - and it will not bar non-partisan, non-issue ads for voter registration, along with a few other exceptions yet to be named.\n\nI wonder if Twitter's new political ads policy will be rolled out just like the global state media policy...which wasn't really global and had big exemptions for like US state media. \u2014 J.

Facebook has been getting pummeled for its decision not to fact-check ads from candidates, and Dorsey may want to spare Twitter from being dragged through the same mud.\n\nAlso on rt.com Facebook bends the knee to outrage grifters in push to \u2018protect our democracy\u2019 \u2013 but who will protect it from them?\n\nDorsey emphasized \u201cthis isn\u2019t about free expression,\u201d and explained that trying to focus on controlling the spread of targeted messaging, disinfo, and deepfakes while also regulating advertising stopped the platform from doing either effectively. Presumably, that means Twitter will focus more on stemming the spread of \u201cdisinfo\u201d going forward - an ominous prospect for users with political views outside of the mainstream, who have seen many of their number kicked off the major social media platforms or shadowbanned smeared as \"disinfo.\"\n\nMany Twitter users applauded the move, cheering Dorsey for \"promoting democracy\" and praising Twitter as \"socially responsible social media\" while slamming Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for being \"more concerned with money\" than integrity.\n\nThe gauntlet has been dropped pic.twitter.com/YK5Tsu1J5O \u2014 Terence Kawaja (@tkawaja) October 30, 2019\n\nSome speculated the intent was to pressure Facebook into changing its own political policies, which have been panned by several of the 2020 candidates even as they buy ads on the platform.\n\nFacebook's policy is that the company will not fact-check political ads or posts from politicians. Which means politicians can lie in ads. So far Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Mark Warner have all complained openly about that.\n\n\n\nTwitter just added some serious pressure IMO \u2014 Kurt Wagner (@KurtWagner8) October 30, 2019\n\nOthers, smelling censorship but approving of the odor, called on Dorsey to ban other groups and individuals\u2026\n\nAwesome, thank you. This is my favorite social media app despite the fact that you are dragging your feet on banning all the Nazis. Please take care of the bots too. Thanks. \u2014 Taryn Jay \ud83c\udf39 (@FeralHog420) October 30, 2019\n\nban Trump next \u2014 Fall AF Scarah Solomon (@sarahsolfails) October 30, 2019\n\n\u2026or other advertisers.\n\nYes! Fossil fuel ads ARE political ads. They\u2019re not advertising gas, they\u2019re advertising policy \u2014 Amy Westervelt (@amywestervelt) October 30, 2019\n\nEliminating political advertising benefits establishment media (which can still buy ads) and incumbents. Without political ads there\u2019d be no new contenders. \u2014 Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) October 30, 2019\n\nSome saw the ban as a cynical political move, however, pointing out that ads are not the real driver of fake political conversations.\n\nThe problem here was never paid ads. You know that. It's fake accounts that amplify political misinformation. You know that.\n\n\n\nBut good move to spin the facebook story as a win for you, I guess. \u2014 GhostOfJohnMcCain (@GhostOfJohnMc11) October 30, 2019\n\nLike this story?
