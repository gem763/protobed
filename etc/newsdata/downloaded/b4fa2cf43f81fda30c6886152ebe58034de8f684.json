She\u2019s been holed up in her room and hasn\u2019t spoken to the other children since.\u201d\n\nSampson said Camryn had been for one session of counselling, but decided not to go again after not finding it helpful.\n\n\u201cI am worried because these exams will affect the rest of her life. She\u2019s still afraid to leave the house.\u201d\n\nSchool governing body chairperson Roy Ram said on Tuesday exams will continue as normal at the school today. He said the situation had \u201cstabilised\u201d and pupil turnout is back to normal after a few tense days last week.\n\nClive Willows, a local psychologist, said trauma like that experienced at Eastwood Secondary could lead to pupils having to deal with poor concentration, distracting thoughts and flashbacks.\n\nHe said, however, that pupils should understand that the emotional intensity of the trauma is temporary.\n\n\u201cIf it is happening, don\u2019t feel too panicked. It is temporary and they should overcome it. It also depends how close a pupil was to the incident. They may have disturbed sleep and flashbacks.\n\n\u201cIt will be a lot worse for them if they believe they will never overcome it. But they must understand that it\u2019s a healing process, not a permanent thing. You may not forget the incident, but the emotional intensity will hopefully subside.\u201d\n\nA total of 790 405 pupils will take their exams this year, across 7 416 examination centres, the Department of Basic Education said. There will be 212 candidates writing from prisons.\n\nQuality assurance body Umalusi gave this year\u2019s exams the green light.\n\nKZN MEC for Education, Kwazi Mshengu, will oversee the exam process at some schools on Wednesday.", "description": "The matriculant who was stabbed last week at Eastwood Secondary School is still struggling to cope with the trauma as she enters the first day of her crucial Matric exams.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9490/350adec47014446e8a856b19a3166248.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
