Joseph Dunford announced that \"all indications are that Iran was responsible for the attacks.\" They explained that the US is responding with a \"moderate deployment\" of additional forces.\n\nDunford said that it was \"fair to say\" this deployment would not involve thousands of troops.\n\n\"We haven't decided on specific units,\" the general told reporters. He explained that the US is providing capabilities to enhance air and missile defense.\n\nLast Saturday, Saudi oil facilities were struck by drones and missiles in an attack that the US has blamed on Iran, a country that has also been blamed in recent months for mining oil tankers, pirating vessels, and shooting down unmanned aircraft, among other hostile behavior.\n\n\"Iran has increased its military activity through direct attacks and support to its proxies in the region,\" the secretary said Friday evening. The US has already ratcheted up sanctions against Iran, but now the US is strengthening its military posture.\n\nThe lastest troop increase follows the significant deployment this summer of strategic military assets to deter troubling Iranian behavior. Among the assets sent to the region were a carrier strike group, bomber and fighter squadrons, air defense systems, and ground troops.\n\nWhile this past summer was characterized by a series of crises, one of which nearly brought the US and Iran into armed conflict, tensions have not been running as hot in recent weeks.\n\nRead more: The US is blaming Iran for devastating strikes in Saudi Arabia as tensions with Tehran rise again after a stressful summer\n\nBut, the attack on Saudi oil facilities shook global energy markets, and in the aftermath, the president tweeted that the US was \"locked and loaded\" to respond.\n\nFor now, the US will focus its efforts on bolstering the defenses of its regional partners rather than striking Iran, but Trump has indicated that this possibility remains on the table.", "description": "On Friday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen.
