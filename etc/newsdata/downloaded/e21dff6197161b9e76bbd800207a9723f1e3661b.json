Row 4, Love House, Caron Callahan, Sunspel.\n\nWhether we\u2019re ordering copper pots from Amazon Prime, pho on Caviar, or grenache from any one of those subway-advertised wine-delivery start-ups, New Yorkers are really just a couple of apps away from being complete shut-ins. And yet there\u2019s still so much to do in this town \u2014 like sampling garam-masala-spiked lamb chops in Long Island City, trying on leopard-print Ala\u00efa coats in the Seaport, sipping fresh-pressed sake in Industry City, and scrambling up the city\u2019s tallest rock-climbing walls in Bushwick. (You\u2019ll find those and more in our yearly best-of review, rolling out this week.) This year\u2019s best-of list in the shopping category includes women\u2019s clothing, toddler athleisure, vintage furniture, and more.\n\nGen-Z Garb\n\nDepop\n\n168 Mott St., nr. Broome St.; 646-609-4311\n\nThe front of Depop \u2014 the brick-and-mortar iteration of the popular-with-the-kids resale app \u2014 is dedicated to vintage wares from a curated group of vendors, which currently includes Nicole Salda\u00f1a, a shoe designer who sells secondhand on the side. The selection here is small but reasonably priced \u2014 and filled with treasures. One visit unearthed a vintage pearlescent Oscar de la Renta top for $110, a bright-yellow beaded purse for $65, and a smattering of narrow Prada and Armani sunglasses (from $95). The back of the shop is something different altogether: a fully functioning studio where Depop sellers can photograph their wares against a white brick wall or, if they prefer, paper backdrops in pretty much any color. And since it\u2019s 2019, several Instagrammable features are scattered throughout the store, notably a massive pair of clay sneakers (by artist Diana Rojas) that shoppers can stick their feet into for pictures.\n\nDepop.

Prince St.; 646-454-0811\n\nCaron Callahan\u2019s first permanent storefront is stocked with the feminine basics that built her brand: cream canvas jackets ($345), pale-pink cotton jumpsuits with a slightly cropped leg ($498), and perfectly tailored Japanese-twill sailor pants ($335). But this isn\u2019t just a showroom for her line. Callahan has stocked every remaining inch of the space with special one-off items that make you feel as if you\u2019ve stumbled into the apartment of your best-dressed friend. On a table in the center you\u2019ll find turquoise silk obiage scarves (traditionally tied around Japanese kimonos; $150), a book about unconventional American quilts ($50), and a pair of high-waisted silk-mesh underwear by Vivien Ramsay ($98). Under the cash register is an all-star lineup of antique and indie jewelry, from Victorian rings studded with rubies and diamonds (from $750) to a pair of sterling-silver earrings shaped like snail shells by L.A. designer MM Druck ($295).\n\nTrinkets\n\nRelationships\n\n920 Fulton St., nr. Washington Ave., Clinton Hill; 917-909-1651\n\nFrom the outside, Relationships looks like a coffee shop, which it is, and a good one at that: Offerings include iced cocoas and pastries from beloved Bed-Stuy bakery Saraghina, all kept behind a geometric counter by design firm Studio Proba. But the real draw is the slightly offbeat selection of home goods and furniture curated by owners Nina Schwarz, a former gallerist, and Su Beyazit, who owns the local vintage store\u2013slash\u2013salon Su\u2019juk. The walls are hung with sumi-ink paintings by the artist Denise Kupferschmidt (from $3,000), chosen by Schwarz, and an assortment of LikeMindedObjects\u2019 face-shaped mirrors (from $125). Furniture is arranged in vignettes: A Chubby Chair by Jack Rabbit Studio ($1,800), for instance, sits under a lamp by Brooklyn artist Will Stewart ($750). Up front are shelves full of trinkets by seemingly every cool-on-Instagram designer: from pastel wedge-shaped pipes by Yew Yew Shop ($68) to plywood vases from Pezzi ($40). At night, the place opens for events: On a recent Tuesday, it served vegan pies and screened You\u2019ve Got Mail.\n\nMen\u2019s Basics\n\nSunspel\n\n85 Mercer St., nr. Spring St.; 646-692-6500\n\nSunspel has been creating classic knitwear staples in superfine fabrics since it was founded in Britain in 1860 and was one of the first companies to produce T-shirts. So it makes sense that the Mercer Street store \u2014 Sunspel\u2019s first in the States \u2014 is something of a shrine to well-made basics. English-ash tables are piled with chunky Egyptian-cotton sweaters (\u201cjumpers,\u201d if you want to fit in; from $255) and simple, well-cut pima-cotton tees (from $85) in a rainbow of colors. Posters on the shop\u2019s walls give the clothing historical context: Above a rack of startlingly crisp boxer shorts (the staff frequently steams them; from $50) is a poster explaining that John Hill, the great-grandson of Sunspel\u2019s founder, introduced the first pair of boxers to the U.K. in 1947.\n\nLove House.

West St., Ste. 308, Greenpoint; 347-916-0096\n\nNew to Greenpoint\u2019s ever-growing furniture mecca (Bi-Rite, Adverts, Copper+Plaid) is Love House, a showroom on the third floor of a warehouse building. An all-white loft, the space holds an impressive selection of unique new and vintage furniture in the moderate to ultra-pricey range. Owners Jared Heinrich and Aric Yeakey (both former photographers) weren\u2019t interested in filling the store with the predictable slate of mid-century-modern credenzas and chairs that can easily be found elsewhere in the neighborhood; the curation instead leans Brutalist and Art Deco, with a little MCM mixed in. A cobalt leather Thonet Cantilever chair ($1,150) mingles easily with a black-and-chrome Milo Baughman sofa ($8,000), while an oversize 1984 Michele Zalopany piece hangs between a pair of giant Marzio Rusconi Clerici sconces ($1,850). Existing pieces can be reupholstered, and if you don\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for, the guys offer a custom furniture design and fabrication service, too.\n\nWatch Store\u2013Slash\u2013Whiskey Bar\n\nWatches of Switzerland\n\n60 Greene St., nr. Broome St.; 646-973-3363\n\nLocated in a former warehouse, this large split-level Soho boutique has become more than just a place to find timepieces from top-tier brands like Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Jaeger-LeCoultre. Downstairs, there\u2019s a library and a long marble bar that offers complimentary cocktails created for the boutique by mixology experts at Death & Co (the Revenue Act \u2014 a blend of citrus, whiskey, cognac, and honey \u2014 is particularly tasty). This inviting feel extends to the watch counters, too, despite prices that stretch into six figures for highly collectible models, many of which are limited editions. For the watch aficionado who\u2019d rather not spend a semester at Harvard\u2019s worth, there are some (relatively) affordable options. TAG Heuers, for instance, start at around $1,000.\n\nWatches of Switzerland. Photo: Courtesy of the vendor\n\nAirport Bookstore\n\nMcNally Jackson\n\nLa Guardia Airport, Terminal B\n\nLa Guardia\u2019s recently renovated Terminal B will come as a shock to New Yorkers who are accustomed to being stuck waiting for flights between a greasy Panda Express and a bevy of grimly maintained food stalls. Terminal B\u2019s seats are equipped with outlets, the bathrooms are squeaky clean, and the stores are, well, kind of exceptional. Notably, there\u2019s a miniature version of the beloved, highly curated Soho bookstore McNally Jackson. The shop combines traditional airport books \u2014 best-selling thrillers, business titles, and flashy biographies \u2014 with hundreds of less-obvious airplane-friendly literary picks: On a grab-and-go table out front, Random Family and a stack of Tana French thrillers sit beside Becoming, by Michelle Obama. And for those wanting to bone up on the Midwest before a flight to Chicago, say, there is a substantive travel section.\n\nVintage Clothes\n\nArcade\n\n51 35th St., nr. Second Ave., Sunset Park; 718-801-7936\n\nTwice a year, the traveling vintage marketplace A Current Affair touches down in Brooklyn, with clothing, shoes, and accessories from over 150 of the world\u2019s best retailers and private dealers. Devoted shoppers from across the tristate area pay $12 to enter a space so saturated with beautiful vintage \u2014 and with other devoted shoppers \u2014 that it feels like a month wouldn\u2019t be enough time to carefully sort through it. This is what made the news that the curators of A Current Affair had opened a full-time shop in Industry City so exciting. The space, which feels like a minimalist bohemian loft, is a much less stressful version of the (still-running) marketplace. The selection is (extremely) pared down \u2014 only a couple hundred pieces are ever in the shop at once \u2014 but the team carefully rotates the floor weekly, so the racks perpetually feel new. A recent trip yielded a red velvet Tom Ford\u2013era Gucci blazer ($498), a 1970s Lanvin couture floral dress ($798), and a 1980s Gianni Versace sheer silver moto jacket ($228).\n\nArcade. Photo: Alexander Barreto\n\nToddler Athleisure\n\nMarshalls\n\n206 Washington St., nr. Vesey St. 212-587-1901\n\nIt was perhaps a bit depressing to see a discount chain take over 65,000 square feet of a landmark Financial District building credited as the first Art Deco skyscraper in NYC. But this is a neighborhood where kids\u2019 boutiques regularly charge upwards of a hundred dollars for a cotton-blend sweatshirt. So it sure is nice to see so many striped Polo tees and Dri-FIT leggings on clearance. It seems appropriate that brands like Nike and Under Armour were reportedly in talks to lease this space before Marshalls set up here in 2017: Those labels are everywhere on the particularly robust toddler racks (the buyers clearly know the local demographic), with a Swoosh tank for as little as two bucks, a quilted puffer for $18, fleece sweatpants for $10, and plenty of little grippy athletic socks, Adidas sneakers, and Tiger Woods\u2013style baseball caps to top it all off. And despite this location\u2019s being three times the size of the many other Marshalls invading Brooklyn and Manhattan these days, the discreet alleyway entrance has the tranquil feel of an old-world department store with none of the Century 21 crowds.\n\nToys\n\nFAO Schwarz\n\n30 Rockefeller Plz., nr. Sixth Ave. 800-326-8638\n\nFAO Schwarz, which had been in New York for 145 years, closed its Fifth Avenue location in 2015 and opened the doors (guarded, like the original location\u2019s, by toy soldiers, who are dressed, unlike the original location\u2019s, in uniforms designed by Gigi Hadid) to its new 20,000-square-foot flagship just before the holidays. Inside is a veritable Who\u2019s Who of the children\u2019s toy world in 2019. There\u2019s a Melissa & Doug grocery store, where kids can fill mini-carts with wooden cantaloupes and raw steaks; the perennially popular Hatchimals have a solo display. Also unlike the original location, this FAO is rife with \u201cexperiences\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s a baby-adoption setup, where \u201cdoctors\u201d teach children how to properly tend to their dolls, and a raceway, where customers can work with trained mechanics to build remote-controlled cars. For nostalgia\u2019s sake, the store brought back two FAO mainstays: the three-story clock tower and a spiffed-up, 15-feet-longer facsimile of the iconic dance-on piano.\n\nConcept Store\n\n10 Corso Como\n\n1 Fulton St., nr. South St.; 212-265-9500\n\nThat Carla Sozzani would open the first U.S. outpost of her famed 10 Corso Como in the city\u2019s still-developing, out-of-the-way Seaport District makes sense: She opened the venerated boutique\u2019s first location, in Milan in the early \u201990s, in a (then) out-of-the-way converted garage. The Manhattan store seamlessly translates what makes its Milanese counterpart so special. At over 28,000 square feet, it contains a gallery displaying a selection of Steve Hiett; a (genuinely delicious) Italian restaurant; and home items, including a Hot Dog sofa by Seletti x Studio Job ($7,100). And then there are the clothes. The store has one of the largest collections of pieces by Azzedine Ala\u00efa, knits from Sies Marjan (from $495), and a range of only\u2013in\u2013New York items, like a line of tourist-destination-inspired garb that Sozzani created in collaboration with Off-White. The space, too, is a marvel: The ceiling is studded with 500 metallic disc-shaped lights by the artist Kris Ruhs, and, at the shop\u2019s center, a glazed box houses dozens of exotic plants (in pots decorated, of course, with a nod to 10CC\u2019s spotted logo).\n\n*This article appears in the March 4, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
