(AP) - Nevada Republican Party officials have re-elected their incumbent chairman and scrapped their presidential nominating contests in 2020.\n\nMembers of the Nevada GOP\u2019s central committee met Saturday in the rural city of Winnemucca, about seven hours by car from Las Vegas and two hours from Reno.\n\nCanceling primaries, caucuses and other voting is not unusual for the party of the White House incumbent seeking a second term.\n\nDoing so allows President Donald Trump to try to consolidate his support as Democrats work to winnow their large field of candidates.\n\nNevada GOP spokesman Keith Schipper said the party \u201cwill vote to endorse and bind the delegates to the President at a later date.\u201d\n\nSchipper said Trump has a lock on the nomination and scuttling the nominating caucuses will save party resources.\n\nOver the last year, the Trump campaign has mounted a quiet effort to scuttle any attempts at a presidential challenge by dissidents within the GOP.\n\nThe campaign is mindful that a serious primary challenge could be damaging to Trump even if it is all-but-certain to fail, potentially weakening the president ahead of the general election.\n\nRepublican leaders in Kansas and South Carolina also voted Saturday to all but formally endorse the sitting president more than a year before the election.\n\nNevada\u2019s central committee members stopped short of nominating Trump outright. They said that vote won\u2019t happen until February, in keeping with Republican national committee rules.\n\n\u201cAs the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, my job is to ensure not only President Trump\u2019s victory in Nevada, but also to elect more Republicans down the ballot,\u201d state party Chairman Michael McDonald said. \u201cIt would be malpractice on my part to waste money on a caucus to come to the inevitable conclusion that President Trump will be getting all our delegates in Charlotte. I am excited that our central committee has agreed with this proposal and voted to give us a way to bypass the caucus process.\u201d\n\nMcDonald, who has served as state GOP chairman since 2012, easily won a three-way race with 57% of the vote to win a fifth term.\n\nHe defeated Mesquite Councilwoman Annie Black and former Clark County GOP chairman Dave McKeon.\n\nIn Nevada, Democrats hold a 73,000 active registered voter advantage over Republicans on the strength of their 165,000-voter lead in Clark County, where 71% of Nevada\u2019s voters reside, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nRepublicans have a registration advantage in the state\u2019s other 16 counties. State active-voter registration is 38% Democratic, 33% Republican, and 22% nonpartisan according to August figures from the secretary of state\u2019s office.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nevada Republican Party officials have re-elected their incumbent chairman and scrapped their presidential nominating contests in 2020.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/25/France_G7_Summit_Trump_04281.jpg-dcc81_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
