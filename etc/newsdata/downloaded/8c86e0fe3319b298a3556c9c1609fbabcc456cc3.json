REUTERS/Charles Platiau/Files\n\nThe operation in Indonesia involved a network of over 100 fake accounts on Facebook and Instagram posting content in English and Indonesian either in support or criticizing the West Papua independence movement, which is active in the country\u2019s restive easternmost region of Papua.\n\n\u201cThis was a network of pages designed to appear like local media organizations and advocacy organizations,\u201d said David Agranovich, Facebook\u2019s Global Lead for Threat Disruption.\n\nHe told Reuters that his team, which had been monitoring Indonesia in light of increasing tensions in Papua, had tracked the false accounts, which would disseminate content, buy ads, and drive people to other sites, to an Indonesian media firm called InsightID.\n\nReuters was not immediately able to reach the firm for comment.\n\nThere has been a spike in protests and unrest since late August in Papua, which suffered some of its worst bloodshed in decades in September, with 33 people killed and scores injured.\n\nResearchers had independently warned in September that there had been a rise of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts on Papua, with some of the fake accounts posting pro-government content.\n\nAgranovich said Facebook also removed fake accounts related to two other unconnected networks in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nOne, according to Facebook, was based out of Egypt, but targeted the rest of the region by posting content in support of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, as well as criticism of Qatar, Iran, Turkey and Yemen\u2019s separatist movement.\n\nThe executive said this operation used fake accounts \u201cto masquerade as local media organizations in a variety of those countries ... and amplify the content they were posting.\u201d\n\nAccording to Agranovich, Facebook found evidence some of the pages had been purchased, with regular changing ownerships, as well as deep links to Egyptian newspaper El Fagr, \u201cwhich is known for its sensationalistic content.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the investigation, Facebook has also removed El Fagr\u2019s official media pages from its platforms, he said.\n\nReuters was not able to immediately contact El Fagr.\n\nFacebook said the third network, which it tracked to three marketing firms in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Nigeria, involved fake accounts which spread on content on topics like UAE\u2019s activity in Yemen and the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nThe social media giant has recently been cracking down on such accounts after coming under fire in the last few years for its self-admitted sluggishness in developing tools to combat extremist content and propaganda operations.\n\nEarlier this year, it removed accounts from Iraq, Ukraine, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Thailand, Honduras and Israel.\n\n(Corrects spelling of Agranovich, changes paragraph 11 to refer to pages not accounts)", "description": "Facebook Inc has announced it removed hundreds of pages, groups and accounts on its platforms for \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" linked to three operations in Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Nigeria.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436912242&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9304Y", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
