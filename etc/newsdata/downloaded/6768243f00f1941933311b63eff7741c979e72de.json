ARM's continued supply of chip technology to Huawei's fully-owned chipmaker HiSilicon will ease the pressure it faces.\n\nHuawei's proprietary chips such as Kirin 990 mobile processors and Ascend 910 AI chipset are built on ARM's design architecture and considered a major hallmark of the Chinese firm's attempts to reduce its reliance on US technologies.\n\n\"ARM's v8 and v9 are UK-origin technologies,\" an ARM spokeswoman told Reuters news agency via email on Friday.\n\n\"ARM can provide support to HiSilicon for the ARM v8-A architecture, as well as the next generation of that architecture, following a comprehensive review of both architectures, which have been determined to be of UK origin.\"\n\nThe US government alleges that Huawei is a national security risk as its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy.
