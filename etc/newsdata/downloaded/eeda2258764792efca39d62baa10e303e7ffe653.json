Indeed, Trump failed to win a majority of evangelicals in any Super Tuesday primary.\n\nCrossfire Hurricane review: tale of Trump and the FBI is a gas gas gas Read more\n\nHowe\u2019s subtitle tells the tale: Why Evangelicals Chose Political Power over Christian Values.\n\nThe explanations are varied. One is economic. Areas of the US that simply felt forgotten overlap significantly with white evangelical support for Trump. So there was receptivity to Trump\u2019s message, and economic concerns trumped moral ones.\n\nOr perhaps they didn\u2019t: many evangelical leaders claimed that issues of life and religious liberty were at stake, perhaps irreversibly, if Hillary Clinton won, so voters should choose Trump despite (or, in some cases, forgiving) his personal failures. Pressure on voters on abortion and the supreme court was at times intense. In the end, \u201conly 4% of evangelicals cited abortion as their determining factor\u201d \u2013 but it was a decisive 4%.\n\nAs Howe notes, \u201cTrump evangelicals are very fond of binary choices\u201d, many of which are in essence \u201cfalse dilemmas\u201d in which a supposed \u201cgreater moral consideration takes precedence\u201d. This \u201cwhataboutism\u201d was key. Could one have opposed Trump and Clinton? Of course \u2013 and Trump would have lost. Yet, as Howe reminds us, \u201cputting God in one compartment\u201d and politics in another \u201cis clearly out of step with Christian tradition\u201d.\n\nAnger is one of the deadly sins, yet the 'toxic mixture of resentment and desire for revenge' made power more attractive\n\nThis provides a further clue. Howe writes extensively about the impact of social media and cable news in deepening the political divide in America and intensifying it to fresh levels of vitriol and \u201chyperbolic outrage\u201d, largely based on the idea of victimization. This had dramatic effects: a spirit of bitterness and a \u201cpersecution complex\u201d on the right meant that \u201c [a]s the clicks came, and the ideas were reinforced through group dynamics, they became even more pronounced. Anger had become a currency.\u201d\n\nAnger is, of course, one of the seven deadly sins, yet the \u201ctoxic mixture of resentment and desire for revenge\u201d made power more attractive: \u201cIt was time to start winning again.\u201d\n\nTrump promised power. \u201cIn the end,\u201d Howe writes, \u201cIt\u2019s what many absolutely believe Trump as president has given them.\u201d\n\nPower was one of the temptations the devil offered Jesus. He refused.\n\nThis is a deeply introspective, at times anguished book. Howe shows how each proffered rationale for support for Trump departs sharply from evangelical tradition. Howe was brought up in a strong evangelical household. Both parents worked at Jerry Falwell Sr\u2019s Liberty University and took troubled youths into their home.\n\nHe cannot compare this with, notably, Jerry Falwell Jr\u2019s unremitting support of Trump, even posing for a picture in front of a Playboy magazine with Trump on the cover, which would have horrified his father, who bitterly opposed the easy spread of pornography. Howe was \u201cstunned\u201d at this but it was merely a prelude to a pastors\u2019 gathering with Trump in June 2016 in which Howe sees the beginning of the shift in support.\n\n\u201cIn a generation,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe movement had changed \u2026 from trying to be a force for change in politics, to being forcefully changed by politics.\u201d This is a far cry from the changed lives that were the traditional hallmark of the evangelical movement, as another recent book about a former Klansman devoting his life to racial reconciliation illustrates so well.\n\nUltimately, Howe is most concerned for the witness of the evangelical church, not least \u201cthe injury it does to the soul of Donald Trump\u201d. He asks: \u201cYou\u2019ve gained the world. How is your soul faring?\u201d\n\nThe movement \u201cneed[s] to own our own mistakes\u201d, he writes, and develop the ability to \u201cfind the strength to be a light for others, even when we find the light of our nation dimming\u201d. To balance reason with compassion.\n\nPerhaps younger evangelicals will bolt in 2020; as evangelical leader Russell Moore recently noted, \u201c[They] never expected a nominally Christian culture\u201d anyway, so the binary choice is less compelling.\n\nThe percentage of white evangelicals who pull the lever for Trump in 2020 matters, probably decisively, to the result. It thus matters for the world and it matters for them. Or, as Jesus put it: \u201cRemember, then, what you received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.\u201d", "description": "As a scandal-ridden presidency lurches towards impeachment, Ben Howe offers valuable insight into how it came to this", "authors": ["John Gardner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0afce07fbf3a995098034d8845877f3a40b7f860/0_0_4466_2680/master/4466.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7bca3b245d3e49ac8446d0a4bdfb1050", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
