She will get to pick those board members if two people currently on the board, Bruce Dunlevie and Steven Langman, step down.\n\nAnother possible change being considered is taking Rebekah Neumann out of this role, the source added.\n\nDespite receiving lukewarm interest in its shares, the We Company is pressing ahead with an initial public offering and may seek a valuation as low as $15 billion to $18 billion in its IPO, down from the $47 billion value it commanded in the last private fundraising round in January.\n\nThe news on plans to curb Neumann\u2019s voting power was earlier reported by the Financial Times.\n\nWe Company declined to comment on changes in the corporate governance.", "description": "WeWork owner The We Company's executives, investors and advisers are discussing curbing the voting power of founder Adam Neumann and removing his co-founder wife from a role in succession planning, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Joshua Franklin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429197025&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1ZM", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
