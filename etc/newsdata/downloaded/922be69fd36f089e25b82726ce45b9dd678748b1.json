(Simon Dawson/Reuters)\n\nOn Sept. 3, 1939, England declared war against Germany, and Winston Churchill was invited back from political exile to serve as First Lord of the Admiralty and later prime minister in the war against Adolf Hitler. Eighty years later to the day, his grandson said he would be expelled from the Conservative Party for voting against embattled Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit.\n\nNicholas Soames, a member of Parliament representing Mid Sussex, was among the group of 21 Conservative politicians who defied Johnson\u2019s wishes by voting for a motion that paves the way for Brexit to be delayed till 2020. Hours after the vote Tuesday, a spokesperson for 10 Downing Street said conservative MPs who did not support the prime minister \u201cwill have the Tory whip removed,\u201d the Financial Times reported, meaning that they would not be allowed to stand as Conservative representatives in Parliament.\n\nSoames, 71, confirmed this in an interview with BBC Newsnight.\n\n\u201cI have been told by the Chief Whip \u2026 that it will be his sad duty to write me tomorrow to tell me that I have had the whip removed,\u201d said Soames, adding that in his 37 years as a Conservative member, he has voted against the party only three times. In the wake of the vote, Soames does not plan to stand for Parliament in the coming general election, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fortunes of war,\u201d Soames said. \u201cI knew what I was doing.\u201d\n\n[Britain may face snap elections after Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffers major loss in Parliament]\n\nOther high-profile politicians who will be booted out of the party include former chancellors of the exchequer, or treasury secretaries, Philip Hammond and Ken Clarke, who have both served as Conservative MPs for decades.\n\nSir Nicholas Soames MP confirms to #Newsnight that he will not stand in the next general election.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have been told by the chief whip\u2026 that I have had the whip removed after 37 years as a Conservative MP.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to stand\u201d@NSoames | @maitlis pic.twitter.com/P73srDcU4o \u2014 BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) September 3, 2019\n\nThe expulsion of Soames marks a dramatic development in the increasingly fraught debate over Johnson\u2019s \u201cdo-or-die\u201d plan to leave the European Union by Halloween regardless of whether there is a plan on the table. Without the 21 rebel MPs, the prime minister\u2019s Conservative Party has lost its voting majority in Parliament. Johnson has called for a general election, which will be discussed Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt is a pity \u2014 a great pity \u2014 that this has in my view all been planned,\u201d Soames said to the BBC. \u201cThis is exactly what they wanted, and they will try to have a general election, which is what they wanted.\u201d\n\nPundits pointed out that the expulsion of Soames is an ironic turning point for Johnson, who has unabashedly stated his admiration for Churchill throughout his political career.\n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up there was no doubt about it. Churchill was quite the greatest statesman that Britain had ever produced,\u201d Johnson wrote in an affectionate biography of the prime minister in 2014.\n\nIt will be quite something if Boris Johnson withdraws the Conservative whip from Sir Nicholas Soames, the grandson of his political hero, Winston Churchill \u2014 Shehab Khan (@ShehabKhan) September 3, 2019\n\nAs The Post\u2019s Kevin Sullivan and Karla Adams reported:", "description": "Pundits said this is an ironic turning point for the embattled prime minister, who sees Churchill as his political hero.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Gb25Lpx63jVOxBtNtW6L7Yu_pGY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VNLLXKWOHUI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
