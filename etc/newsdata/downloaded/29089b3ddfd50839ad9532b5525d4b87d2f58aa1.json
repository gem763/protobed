At 48 megapixels and half an inch across, the IMX586 is bigger than most mobile sensors on the market, and it offers far more resolution than competitors, despite not requiring a large camera bump. But with tiny 0.8-micron pixels, won\u2019t image quality be compromised?\n\nWell, the first phone to use the new sensor has arrived in the shape of Honor\u2019s View 20, which was announced in full today in Paris. There\u2019s a lot more to say about this phone, not least how its distinctive hole-punch display works out in practice. (A full review from Vlad Savov will follow soon.) In the meantime, I\u2019ve been testing the phone\u2019s headline feature to see if 48 megapixels can make a meaningful difference in mobile photography.\n\nIn short, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d Under the right conditions, this phone takes amazing photos with detail far beyond what I\u2019d expect from a conventional mobile image sensor. But it does require a little experimentation to get the best results, and the ideal mode for each situation may not always be what you might assume.\n\nThe default setting for the View 20\u2019s camera is actually a 12-megapixel mode that supposedly delivers results akin to a much larger sensor with 1.6-micron pixels. This is because Sony\u2019s sensor uses a quad-Bayer RGB layout involving 2 x 2 squares of pixels assigned to a given color, meaning that the effective resolution really is 12 megapixels. But the sensor allows the phone\u2019s image signal processor to convert this array into a 48-megapixel image in good light. Honor also has a more advanced mode called \u201c48MP AI Ultra Clarity\u201d that uses the Kirin 980 processor\u2019s machine learning capabilities. It requires a few seconds of holding the phone still in order to capture and combine multiple 48-megapixel frames, and Honor only advises using it in good light with stationary subjects.\n\nHere\u2019s an image from Sony showing how the quad-Bayer filter and array conversion work:\n\nFor this comparison, I\u2019ll be putting the View 20\u2019s various modes up against each other and the iPhone XS Max. The iPhone\u2019s popularity makes it a useful frame of reference, but it\u2019s also a technically interesting comparison because of its combination of a 12-megapixel sensor and a 2x telephoto lens. You\u2019d expect Honor to out-resolve the iPhone\u2019s main 12-megapixel camera, but can the greater sensor resolution catch up to longer optics?\n\nNone of these photos have been edited in any way other than by cropping to show pixel-level detail.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a 12-megapixel shot taken facing Tokyo Skytree at around 2PM on a cloudless, sunny day. In other words, these are the best possible conditions for tiny pixels to do their thing. The View 20 is on the left, the iPhone XS Max is on the right.\n\nAs you can see, these are really different exposures, and the one you think is better will come down to personal preference. The iPhone\u2019s Smart HDR processing turns in an even, flatter photo with more depth in the shadows, while the View 20 shot is a lot more dramatic and contrasty. Check out that gradient in the sky.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at the pixel-level detail on this shot.\n\nThe View 20 clearly wins in terms of detail, even with both cameras shooting at 12 megapixels. But how do the 48-megapixel modes compare?\n\nAs you can see, there\u2019s basically no benefit to using the regular 48-megapixel mode over the default 12 megapixels. All you\u2019re getting is a larger file size, essentially. The separate 48-megapixel AI Ultra Clarity mode, however, is stunning. This is an amazing level of detail for a phone camera to capture from so far away.\n\nHere\u2019s how it compares to the iPhone XS Max\u2019s 2x zoom lens, which mathematically should offer about the same resolution.\n\nThe iPhone image is sharper and obviously better exposed, but it\u2019s impressive that the View 20 holds up as well as it does here. Remember, this was taken with a wide-angle lens, and it exhibits this degree of sharpness across the whole scene, whereas the iPhone\u2019s frame is zoomed in twice as far.\n\nA similar comparison could be made with the Pixel 3, which Google claims can emulate a 2x zoom lens through its AI-powered Super Res Zoom feature. Again, though, the Honor phone achieves a comparable level of detail across an uncropped wide-angle frame.\n\nHere\u2019s a 12-megapixel shot taken in the shade (iPhone on the right):\n\nAnd here\u2019s how the 12-megapixel mode compares to AI Ultra Clarity:\n\nOverall, I am very impressed with AI Ultra Clarity\u2019s ability to capture a ton of detail across the frame. It also holds up pretty well with moving objects, to an extent, despite not being designed for it. Here\u2019s a picture of a cyclist in motion, for example, that exhibits no artifacts:\n\nThis picture of a boat, too, turned out pretty well:\n\nBut the mode doesn\u2019t work for faster-moving subjects, partly because you have to hold the phone still for several seconds and partly because you end up with a rolling shutter-style effect, as seen on this taxi:\n\nThe View 20\u2019s camera is capable in low light, but as Honor suggests, you don\u2019t get much benefit out of the 48-megapixel shooting modes. Instead, it\u2019s best to use the default 12-megapixel setting, which bunches four pixels of the same color together for better light sensitivity, supposedly resulting in the equivalent of 1.6-micron pixels. Here\u2019s a shot next to the native 12-megapixel, 1.4-micron iPhone:\n\nThe View 20 shot is much brighter and more detailed. It\u2019s clear that while Honor is applying more aggressive processing and sharpening, the camera does capture more detail to work with in the first place. You could certainly make the case that Honor goes a little too far, however. There\u2019s a lot of artifacting in the first crop shown here.\n\nThe View 20 also has a dedicated night mode, but, unfortunately, it isn\u2019t very good. While it does sometimes result in a more pleasing exposure, the results I\u2019ve seen are usually blurrier than the default 12-megapixel setting, and they fall apart under scrutiny. When the night mode photos are usable, they don\u2019t end up looking much different than regular shots.\n\nHere\u2019s a comparison between a 12-megapixel shot and a night mode shot:\n\nThe night mode shot had an exposure that was 80 times longer than the regular shot\u2019s, but you wouldn\u2019t know it to look at the two. Google\u2019s Night Sight this is not.\n\nFor comparison, though, here\u2019s the iPhone photo:\n\nBoth of the View 20's photos are much better than this, so the underwhelming night mode isn\u2019t that big a deal.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to spend more time with the View 20 to fully evaluate it as a phone and as a camera. But from this first look, the results from Sony\u2019s sensor and Honor\u2019s so-called AI processing are impressive. You can extract a huge amount of detail out of this camera, and there\u2019s only the tiniest of physical bumps to show for it.\n\nPhotography by Sam Byford / The Verge", "description": "The first 48-megapixel phone is here in the shape of Honor\u2019s View 20.
