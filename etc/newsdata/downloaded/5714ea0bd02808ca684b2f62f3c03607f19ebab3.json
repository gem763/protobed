He\u2019s someone who is smiling every day and that doesn\u2019t change when he arrives in the French team,\u201d Lenglet told reporters ahead of France\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Iceland and Turkey.\n\n\u201cHe makes the most of everything, he loves making jokes and he doesn\u2019t change whether he\u2019s with the French team or Barcelona.\u201d\n\nGriezmann was left on the bench for Barca\u2019s 4-0 drubbing of Sevilla on Sunday after failing to live up to his 120 million-euro ($135 million) price tag in the opening weeks of the season, scoring three goals in nine games.\n\nLionel Messi has also denied suggestions of a rift between him and the Frenchman, who joined from Atletico Madrid in July, as he struggles to find a settled position in Ernesto Valverde\u2019s three-man forward line.\n\n\u201cFor me, he\u2019s a player that has just arrived \u2014 and at a club like Barca, who play a little differently from other clubs \u2014 and he\u2019s already scored three goals. He works a lot for the team.\n\n\u201cHe helps us a lot with his talent, with his defensive effort, because he is a player who sacrifices a lot for the team. I don\u2019t think there is any problem with Antoine Griezmann.\u201d\n\nGriezmann was replaced in Barca\u2019s starting line-up against Sevilla by another French forward, Ousmane Dembele, who scored before being sent off for dissent late on.\n\nDembele will miss the clash with Real Madrid on October 26 if banned for two games, continuing a disjointed start to the campaign for the 22-year-old, who has already sat out six games this term through injury.\n\n\u201cIf he gets consistent game time, he is a player who has all the qualities to play for the French team,\u201d said Lenglet, who is expected to start France\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Iceland on Friday and Turkey on Monday.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately he got this red card that will slow him down a bit again. He has a lot of talent, he\u2019s unpredictable, he has qualities that are quite unusual. But it takes experience so he can play matches and perform.\u201d", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Antoine Griezmann is just as happy playing for Barcelona as he is for France despite rumours of\u00a0dressing room unrest amid an", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/e29052_kylian-mbappe-left-antoine-griezmann-in-france-clairefontaine-en-yvelines-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
