The high-level group will be led by Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua.\n\nIndian generic drugmakers have long sought greater market access to China, as have India's IT services. Xi said both were welcome.\n\nChina, for its part, has been urging India to take an independent decision on telecom equipment maker Huawei's bid for India's proposed 3G network and not be swayed by U.S. pressure.\n\nThe United States has asked its allies not to use Huawei equipment, which it says China could exploit for espionage. Beijing denies this accusation.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Xi said he had a free and frank discussion with Modi and would pursue proposals the two leaders discussed to improve bilateral ties. \"Yesterday and today we have engaged in candid discussions and as friends,\" Xi said.\n\n\"I look forward to further discussions, I may follow up on proposals discussed yesterday.\" Xi did not elaborate.\n\nPERSONAL WARMTH\n\nIn Mamallapuram in southern India, Modi took Xi on a personal tour of temple monuments dating back to the seventh and eighth centuries when Indian kingdoms cultivated trade ties with Chinese provinces.\n\nModi noted in his opening remarks that he and Xi had agreed at a previous summit to manage their differences prudently and not let them snowball into disputes.\n\nIndia and China share a 3,500-km (2,200-mile) border, over which they went to war in 1962. The course of the frontier remains unresolved despite more than 20 rounds of talks.\n\nXi also suggested the two sides expand cooperation in the military sector to boost trust.\n\nXi headed to Nepal later on Saturday where he is expected to push for further Chinese involvement in developing its infrastructure as part of Beijing's signature Belt and Road Initiative to boost trade and transport links across Asia.\n\nIndia has refused to join the BRI because a part of it runs through Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, which India claims as its territory.\n\nIt has also said that the infrastructure projects must be tailored for the benefit of the host country and not drive them into debt, which has occurred in the case of the small island nations of Sri Lanka and Maldives.\n\nIndia's Modi picks up trash from seaside town while hosting China's Xi", "description": "UPDATE 2-China, locked in trade war with US, agrees to tackle India's trade deficit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_5_800x533_L_1412601619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
