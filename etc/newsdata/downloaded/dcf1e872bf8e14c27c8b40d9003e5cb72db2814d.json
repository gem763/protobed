One fan has taken it upon themselves to animate his world in a brief fan film, bringing it to life in an eerie short video.\n\nThe video comes from an artist named Ilya Plotnikov, which puts some motion to the art from St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s narrative art book The Electric State, which he Kickstarted in 2017, and set to music that St\u00e5lenhag composed and released online. The film doesn\u2019t exactly convey the entire story, but it does perfectly capture the vibe of the world in the book.\n\nThe story is set in an alternate 1990s, following a runaway teenager and her toy robot as they embark on a road trip across a post-apocalyptic United States. The book is set in its own world, apart from St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s best-known books Tales from the Loop and Things from the Flood, which are set in an alternate Sweden.\n\nA regular film adaptation of the book is also in the works: Avengers: Infinity War\u2019s Russo Brothers optioned the book for a feature film, with Captain America and Avengers screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, set to write, and with It director tasked to helm it Andy Muschietti. That was back in 2017, and during this year\u2019s San Diego Comic-Con, the writers confirmed that the project is still in the works.\n\nQuick look at the next project for Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely! It\u2019s called Electric State. pic.twitter.com/WzqqhaMWvc \u2014 AMC Theatres (@AMCTheatres) July 19, 2019\n\nThat film isn\u2019t the only project based on St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s works. Amazon Prime Video picked up Tales from the Loop for a TV series, which the artist confirmed was currently in production. While we wait for those projects to see the light of day, we\u2019ll at least have this short video to tide us over.", "description": "Simon St\u00e5lenhag has earned a considerable following for his fantastic retro-futuristic artwork in recent years, One fan has taken it upon themselves to animate his world in a brief fan film, bringing it to life in an eerie short video.", "authors": ["Andrew Liptak", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2iyPTXZZr0bQ4O46BL4JCHiQizo=/50x0:1870x953/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18323220/Screen_Shot_2019_07_20_at_12.35.56_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-07-21"}
