Elizabeth Warren's plan would make it illegal to lobby for foreign governments, political parties and companies. | Jessica Hill/AP Photo 2020 Elections Elizabeth Warren beefs up anti-corruption plan ahead of NYC speech\n\nOn the presidential campaign trail, Sen. Elizabeth Warren frequently boasts that she has the \u201cbiggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate.\u201d\n\nOn Monday morning, she announced she wanted to make it a little bigger.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAhead of speech on corruption in New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park on Monday evening that\u2019s expected to draw thousands, Warren unveiled additions to her plan.\n\n\u201cThe goal of these measures is straightforward: To take power away from the wealthy and the well-connected in Washington and put it back where it belongs \u2014 in the hands of the people,\u201d she wrote in a lengthy Medium post that combines the new proposals with the anti-corruption legislation she introduced in August 2018. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s Senate office said they would be reintroducing an updated version of the bill she introduced in the previous Congress \u2014 the \u2018Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act\u2019 \u2014 in the \u201ccoming months.\u201d The additions include a far-reaching ban on lobbyists from engaging in any fundraising activities, one that is likely to face legal challenges. The prohibition would apply to everything from hosting fundraisers to becoming a campaign bundler. Some of the new provisions also include banning members of Congress and other top-ranking government officials from serving on for-profit boards and requiring more disclosures for \"political intelligence\" firms.\n\nWarren will tie her New York City speech to the site of the Triangle Shirtwaist factory where a fire killed 146 people, mostly female immigrants, in 1911 because of unsafe sweatshop working conditions. The disaster provoked widespread outrage and ultimately led to sweeping labor reforms.\n\n\u201cThe fire exposed corruption but these workers didn\u2019t stand on the sidelines,\u201d Warren said in a video released Sunday afternoon previewing the speech. \u201cThey fought back.\u201d Perhaps with an eye to appealing to the many women voters who have been politically motivated in the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s election, Warren added: \u201cBig structural change: brought to you by women.\u201d\n\nFirefighters combat the lethal Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire in the Asch Building on New York\u2019s Washington Place in March 1911.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrats\u2019 presidential announcement rally in Lawrence, Mass., the site of the 1912 \u201cBread and Roses\u201d strike that was led by women, attempted to place her campaign in similar historical context.\n\nRooting out corruption has also been the centerpiece of Warren\u2019s candidacy and key to her political identity. \u201cThe system is rigged,\u201d has been her cri de coeur. In her 2017 book This Fight is Our Fight, Warren chided Barack Obama for not sufficiently appreciating the graft. Referencing a 2016 commencement speech in which Obama said \u201cthe system isn\u2019t as rigged as you think,\u201d Warren retorted: \u201cNo President Obama, the system is as rigged as we think. In fact, it\u2019s worse than most Americans realize.\u201d\n\nThat is why Warren has put such emphasis on her anti-corruption plan. Without it, she thinks it will be difficult to pass other far-reaching legislative goals because of the domination of lobbyists and corporate dollars in Washington policy-making.\n\nIn order to prevent people from finding ways to avoid registering as lobbyists such as becoming \u201cconsultants\u201d or other round-about titles, Warren also calls for abolishing the so-called \u201c20 percent rule,\u201d which lets those who spend less than 20 percent of the time they work for a given client on lobbying avoid registering. Neil Bush, for instance, who\u2019s the son of former President George H.W. Bush, hasn\u2019t registered as a lobbyist despite meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other officials on behalf of a Kuwaiti company.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/7c/e7/c9c961624e0ab6f6ba5072c97b34/warrenobama-thumbnail-copy.jpg\" true\n\nThere are also proposed restrictions on companies\u2019 ability to hire former senior government officials, in an apparent attempt to crack down on former lawmakers and administration officials who advise corporate America without doing anything that would force them to register as lobbyists. Former House Speaker John Boehner, for instance, is a senior strategic adviser at the law and lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs but has never registered to lobby.\n\nPresidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump both placed restrictions on lobbyists entering their administration, but Warren\u2019s proposal goes much further and would codify the restrictions in law, rather than imposing them by executive order.\n\nThe plan would also make it illegal to lobby for foreign governments, political parties and companies \u2014 a huge blow to K Street. Lobbyists registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act who have been paid more than $1.2 billion since 2017, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That number doesn\u2019t include the lobbying of foreign companies such as BP and Toyota, whose lobbyists aren\u2019t considered foreign agents.\n\nThere are some unresolved questions on the legality of Warren\u2019s plan to ban all fundraising activities for lobbyists given recent Supreme Court rulings on campaign finance and free speech. The Warren campaign pointed to a fact-sheet from the liberal-group The Center for American Progress that argues for the provisions\u2018 constitutionality. Still, the law would likely be challenged in court which could delay implementation.\n\nStill, Warren seems undeterred. \u201cI believe that we can root out corruption in Washington,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd when I\u2019m President, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do.\u201d", "description": "Warren\u2019s Senate office said they would be reintroducing an updated version of the bill she introduced in the previous Congress.", "authors": ["Alex Thompson", "Theodoric Meyer"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/25/02/55453ab540c4a9b246a4c5626ef0/190915-elizabeth-warren-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
