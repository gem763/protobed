(Jason Szenes/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nLast month, the Turkish government unveiled the details of a controversial plan to manage Syrian refugees sheltering in Turkey. The solution: sending at least a million of them back over the border into Syria.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s carry them to the safe zones there,\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in Ankara as he described the plan, which would resettle refugees in a 20-mile-deep area on the Syrian side of the two countries\u2019 border.\n\nNow, as Turkey launched a military operation against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria on Wednesday, human rights advocates are raising alarm that any plan to resettle refugees there could ignite a humanitarian disaster and amount to a major breach of Turkey\u2019s obligations to international refugee protections. The concept of the safe zone has been adapted in part from Erdogan\u2019s earlier plans to create a buffer zone to protect the Turkish border.\n\nGerry Simpson, associate director in Human Rights Watch\u2019s crisis and conflict division, said that designating a specific area as a safe zone is \u201ca very dangerous undertaking.\u201d\n\nThere would be major obstacles to keeping such an area safe, he said, including determining whether it should be designated as a no-fly zone, deciding who would police it and ensuring that armed groups are kept separate from civilians.\n\n\u201cThe context in Syria is so complicated and unforeseeable, with so many warring parties vying over so many conflicting interests, that it\u2019s extremely hard to imagine any zone, let alone one that stretches 500 kilometers [310 miles] from east to west, being safe enough for people to live a protected life,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many historical examples where safe zones have become death traps.\"\n\nIn one of the most notorious instances of a failed attempt to keep civilians safe in conflict, Bosnian Serb troops raided the town of Srebrenica in July 1995, executing about 8,000 Muslim men and boys over the course of several days. Srebrenica was one of six zones the U.N. Security Council had designed as \u201csafe areas\u201d in 1993.\n\n\u201cAll too often in the history of mass atrocities, [a safe zone] doesn\u2019t become a safe zone, it becomes a dumping ground or makes civilians more vulnerable,\u201d said Simon Adams, executive director of the Global Center for the Responsibility to Protect, an independent organization focused on the prevention of mass atrocities.\n\nTurkey\u2019s plans to create a safe zone inside Syria, Adams said, \u201csounds like a killing zone dressed up in some humanitarian language.\u201d\n\nThe U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces are among Washington\u2019s most important allies in the fight against the Islamic State, but Turkey sees them as terrorists working alongside Turkey\u2019s Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, known as the PKK.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area,\u201d Erdogan tweeted Wednesday, as Turkish forces launched their offensive against the Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria.\n\nDays earlier, the White House announced that it would withdraw U.S. troops from the area, igniting fury on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers accused the Trump administration of abandoning the Kurdish fighters, who are responsible for guarding a network of detention centers holding Islamic State suspects and their families. But Trump has defended his decision to remove the U.S. troops, saying they \u201cshould have never been there in the first place.\"\n\n\u201cTurkey is now responsible for ensuring all ISIS fighters being held captive remain in prison and that ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape, or form,\u201d Trump said in a statement later Wednesday. The Islamic State is also known as ISIS.\n\nOn top of concerns that civilians will soon be sent to unsafe areas inside Syria, advocates voiced alarm this week that civilians already there also could find themselves trapped inside Turkey\u2019s offensive, falling victim to shelling or airstrikes.\n\nTurkey hosts millions of Syrian refugees and is eager to reduce that burden as it faces an economic crisis at home.\n\nA humanitarian working in the region who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation described the area Erdogan plans to establish a safe zone as a dangerous \u201cno man\u2019s land.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything about that place will be safe,\u201d the aid worker said. In addition to safety concerns, they said the area lacks the infrastructure to house up to a million new people. \u201cMoving people in will be easy, but then what will they do? They will be exposed to harsh winter and summer conditions,\u201d they said. \u201cThere is no infrastructure and absolutely no economic opportunities. That to me is a recipe for disaster.\u201d\n\nDareen Khalifa, a senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, said Erdogan hopes to tip the balance of power in Syria\u2019s Kurdish areas, clearing them of Kurdish fighters before repatriating Syrians there.\n\nBut many of those who could be resettled in this Kurdish region will not go willingly and would not be Kurdish, Khalifa said, describing Erdogan\u2019s plans as essentially amounting to \u201csocially engineering the demography to be predominantly Arab and Turkey-leaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s problematic on so many levels,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nRepublicans assail Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops from northern Syria as Turkey readies offensive\n\nPentagon won\u2019t take over Islamic State prisons if U.S.-allied Kurdish forces withdraw, officials say", "description": "Advocates pointed to past \"safe zone\" disasters, such as the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia, as warnings against establishing one in Syria.", "authors": ["Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady", "Staff Writer", "Foreign Desk", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QyiLsmlKNa1a948BO06ErxBmvRM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QCEK5CW65EI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
