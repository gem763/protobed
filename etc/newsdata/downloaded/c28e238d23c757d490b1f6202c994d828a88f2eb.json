(bit.ly/318hWfg)\n\nInvestors and experts tracking recent IPOs believe companies thinking of going public in the next 12-18 months would be extremely wary of the recent backlash against loss-making firms.\n\nVir posted revenue of $10.7 million for 2018, a nearly four-fold jump from a year earlier, but its losses also ballooned by 66% to roughly $116 million in the same period.\n\nShares of the San Francisco-based infectious disease researcher opened at $16.15 after its initial public offering was priced at the low end of its $20 to $22 per share price range. It raised $142.9 million from the offering.\n\nAt the day\u2019s low of $14.17, the company was valued at slightly over $1.5 billion.\n\nVir researches new therapies for infectious diseases such as hepatitis, tuberculosis and HIV, and counts some of the most high-profile investors in the industry among its backers.\n\nCo-founded by Arch Venture Partners\u2019 Robert Nelsen, both SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are among its biggest backers. Biogen Inc\u2019s (BIIB.O) former Chief Executive Officer George Scangos is its CEO.\n\nJP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Cowen and Barclays are among the lead underwriters for Vir\u2019s IPO.", "description": "Shares of SoftBank-backed Vir Biotechnology Inc fell as much as 28% in one of the worst market debuts in recent months, adding to the gloom in the IPO market after WeWork's failed attempt to list its stock.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
