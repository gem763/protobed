Rech is not releasing the man\u2019s name and has handed over possible evidence to law enforcement as they continue to determine if the confession is legitimate.\n\n\n\n\"We haven't confirmed the legitimacy of the confession, but seeing as it was given by a notable convicted murderer from Wisconsin, we feel responsible to deliver any and all possible evidence to law enforcement and legal teams,\" he told Newsweek. \"Having been in production for 20 months, we've uncovered an unfathomable amount of information and evidence that is leading us to the truth. Our investigation does not end here.\"\n\n\n\nTwo men -- Steven Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey\u2014have spent more than a decade behind bars after being convicted for the 2005 murder of photographer Halbach. Rech confirmed that the man who confessed is neither Avery nor Dassey.\n\n'MAKING A MURDERER' SUBJECT STEVEN AVERY WILL HAVE NEW EVIDENCE HEARD BY COURT IN HIS CASE\n\nThe duo have maintained their innocence since first standing trial in Wisconsin in 2007. Dassey appealed to the Supreme Court, where his request for a new trial was denied, Newsweek reported. Avery is still involved in the appeals process and is currently serving a life sentence without parole, the New York Post reported.\n\nThe 2016 controversial Netflix documentary series \"Making a Murderer\" explored theories that Avery might have been set up for the crime given he had previously served time and had been exonerated for a sexual assault. Authorities said DNA evidence implicated Avery in the murder.\n\n\u2018MAKING A MURDERER\u2019 REBUTTAL PODCAST WILL \u2018TELL THE STORY\u2019 THE CRIME DOC REFUSES TO SHOW, SAYS HOST\n\nAvery\u2019s attorney, Kathleen Zellner, told Heavy that her firm also received a handwritten confession from an unnamed inmate who admitted to killing Halbach. Zellner said her firm announced earlier this month that a citizen was offering $100,000 for information related to Halbach\u2019s \u201creal killer.\u201d\n\nShe explained that when the firm failed to respond to the inmate about the monetary reward, he then approached the production company with his story. Zellner said on Twitter that the handwritten note is \u201cworthless unless it is corroborated.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cHe mailed the handwritten confession to us before he contacted the production company. The confession occurred solely because of our 100K reward offer and had nothing to do with the production company. When we did not immediately respond to this person, he called the production company,\u201d Zellner told Heavy.\n\n\n\nFormer DA Ken Kratz, who handled prosecution in the case, wrote on Twitter: \u201cTo be clear, like everyone else, this is news to me.
