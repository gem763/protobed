U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures delivery fell 1 cent to $55.08 a barrel.\n\nBrent was on track to fall 1.8% for the week, its first decrease in five weeks. WTI was set for a 2.5% loss for the week, its first decrease in three weeks.\n\nThe world\u2019s two largest economies are preparing for new talks and have been making conciliatory gestures ahead of the discussions.\n\nChina will exempt some agricultural products from additional tariffs on U.S. goods, China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency said.\n\nOil prices, however, remained under pressure by concern about a weaker demand outlook that could lead to potential oversupply.\n\n\u201cOil appears to be suggesting that global economic growth has already been impacted by the tariffs while other markets such as the equities appear more focused on future progress,\u201d Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.\n\nBoth the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency (IEA) this week said oil markets could end up in surplus next year, despite a pact by OPEC and its allies to limit supplies. That is largely being offset by growth in U.S. production.\n\nU.S. energy firms this week reduced the number of oil rigs operating for a fourth week in a row, cutting five oil rigs this week and bringing the total count down to 733, the lowest since November 2017, General Electric Co\u2019s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said.
