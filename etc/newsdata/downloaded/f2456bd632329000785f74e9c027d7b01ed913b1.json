Nicolas Lodeiro also scored for the Sounders.\n\n\u201cI am very happy. We deserve this,\u201d Ruidiaz told reporters. \u201cBut we have to keep our feet on the ground because we still have one more step to get to the final.\u201d\n\nThe Sounders face Toronto FC or Atlanta United in the MLS Cup final at 3 p.m. EDT Nov. 10.\n\n\u201cI think when you lose, it\u2019s always hard to assimilate all of the things,\u201d LAFC star Carlos Vela said. \u201cNobody expected this end for our season. We know in playoffs, it\u2019s one game and 90 minutes. If they make better plays than you, you\u2019re out.\u201d\n\nEduard Atuesta put LAFC ahead 1-0 with a score in the 17th minute before Ruidiaz answered with a 22nd minute equalizer. Atuesta scored via free kick while Lodeiro assisted the Ruidiaz goal. Ruidaiz collected the Lodeiro feed above the box before doing a quick turn and dribbling into the box. He then blasted a shot into the near-post netting, beating LAFC keeper Tyler Miller.\n\nJoevin Jones slipped a pass to Lodeiro at the top of the box in the 26th minute during the next scoring sequence. Lodeiro collected the pass before smacking a shot into the lower right side of the net for the final score of the first half.\n\nRuidiaz netted the final goal of the match in the 64th minute. Lodeiro dribbled through the left side of the box before finding a trailing Ruidiaz during that sequence. Ruidiaz ran into the box and used his first touch to blast a shot past a diving Miller.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to have a home game in the semifinal with a chance to host the final and not get it done. We all feel that way,\u201d LAFC manager Bob Bradley said. \u201cWe will continue trying to take the football ideas we have, challenge guys and continue to develop.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of good things this season, but in this moment the only thing that every one of us feels is disappointment.\u201d\n\nToronto and Atlanta face off in the Eastern Conference final at 8 p.m. Wednesday at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for those fans that are out there,\u201d Sounders manager Brian Schmetzer said. \u201cI\u2019m tremendously proud of that group of players. It is fantastic. I\u2019m so happy for this club and for the people involved with the club.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 30 (UPI) \u2014 The Seattle Sounders upset top-seed LAFC to advance to the 2019 MLS Cup final.
