For decades, the Saudis were the world\u2019s top exporter and swing producer, able to change output to meet fluctuations in market demand. Would an assault on their oil bring panic and an extreme rise in prices?\n\nNow there is an answer. The recent drone and missile attacks at Abiqaiq, the Saudi\u2019s largest oil processing center, caused the worst sudden supply disruption in history, knocking out nearly 6 million barrels per day, half of the country\u2019s total production and about 5% of global supply.\n\nBut not much happened in the aftermath. There\u2019s been renewed rhetorical fire and fury between Iran and the U.S., a plan to deploy U.S. \u201cair and missile defense\u201d troops in Saudi Arabia, and a promised increase in U.S. sanctions. Yet almost no panic in the oil market occurred, no surge in prices and no sign of a stock market collapse.\n\nTo understand this, one must look at how dramatically the global oil market has shifted in the past decade, particularly the role of the U.S.\n\nHistory Not a Guide\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the impact oil shocks can have. The Iranian Revolution of 1978-79 took about 5 million barrels per day or 9% of global supply off the market, at a time when oil demand was rising and the Saudis weren\u2019t able to fill the gap. Prices more than doubled and remained high for over a year, raising inflation and bringing a new era of smaller vehicles, energy conservation and lower oil consumption. A decade later, when Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait took out exports from both countries, amounting to 4.3 million barrels per day, or 5% of global supply, the price rise was small and brief. The Saudis had more oil on tap and were able to replace the loss.\n\nThis history helps explain why some observers, in the heat of the moment, thought that the attacks on Saudi facilities at Abiqaiq would push prices up 30% or more. World prices did rise to US$69 per barrel the day after the attacks, but quickly fell back to around $64, where they\u2019d been for much of the summer.\n\nGeopolitical tensions certainly didn\u2019t relax. The Trump administration blamed Iran for the attacks and spoke of a possible military strike, despite a claim of responsibility by the Houthis in Yemen. Iran denied responsibility while the Saudi government insisted the country was at fault.\n\nDespite these rattling sabers, the markets have remained relatively calm. One reason may be that the Saudis seem able to divert enough oil from other sources to keep exports at pre-attack levels for a week or more.\n\nAlso, photos of the attacked sites reveal a fairly sophisticated, precision-targeted operation and serious but limited damage. Individual buildings were not destroyed, as shown by images of more than a dozen spheroidal structures in which crude is depressurized and explosive gases are recovered. The Abqaiq processing center removes these gases and toxic hydrogen sulfide from crude oil, making it safe for export. The limited nature of the damage helps explain why, according to updates from the Saudi government in Riyadh, significant volumes could be quickly restored.\n\nThough getting back to full production may take more time than the two or three weeks claimed by the Saudis, the notion that the country will desperately struggle to keep up exports and that the oil market will be angst-ridden looks like an exaggeration at best.\n\nAmerican Powerhouse\n\nThe new reality of world oil supply that has recently emerged explains why panic remains unlikely with current conditions. And central to this reality is the radically new role played by the U.S., one that will not wither or weaken anytime soon.\n\nIn just six years, America\u2019s production of crude oil rose so rapidly that it surpassed that of both Russia and Saudi Arabia, increasing from 5.5 million to 12.2 million barrels per day. It is now forecast to reach over 13 million barrels per day in 2020. Adding to this other petroleum liquids, especially those derived from natural gas, the total rises to 18 million barrels per day, a level no country has ever before achieved.", "description": "The attack on the Abqaiq oil facilities in Saudi Arabia has sparked geopolitical tensions but has had only a minor impact on oil prices.", "authors": ["Scott L.
