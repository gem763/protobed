The White House said the decision to remove approximately 1,000 troops came after a call on Sunday between Trump and Erdogan, who views the Kurds as a threat to his ruling party.\n\nA U.S. soldier sits atop an armored vehicle during a demonstration on Sunday by Syrian Kurds against Turkish threats.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., expressed concern over \u201creports\u201d of Trump\u2019s planned withdrawal, despite the president\u2019s own tweets confirming the move.\n\nI don\u2019t know all the details regarding President Trump\u2019s decision in northern Syria. In process of setting up phone call with Secretary Pompeo.\n\n\n\nIf press reports are accurate this is a disaster in the making. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\nIf reports about US retreat in #Syria are accurate, the Trump administration has made a grave mistake that will have implications far beyond Syria. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019\n\nGraham said that he and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., plan to introduce \u201cveto-proof\u201d bipartisan sanctions that will call for Turkey\u2019s suspension from NATO if it invades Syria and attacks Kurdish forces.\n\n\u201cThis decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran, & Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids,\u201d Graham added. \u201cShot in the arm to the bad guys. Devastating for the good guys.\u201d\n\nNikki Haley, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to the United Nations, was unequivocal in her criticism.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back. The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend \u2014 Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) October 7, 2019\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement charging that the \u201cwithdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup.\u201d He urged Trump to reconsider and to \"exercise American leadership to keep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners.\"\n\nBrett McGurk, Trump\u2019s former envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, tore into Trump in a series of scathing tweets.\n\nDonald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief. He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation. He sends military personnel into harm\u2019s way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call. \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) October 7, 2019\n\nTrump made a similarly impulsive decision when I was managing the policy. I resigned over it and stand by every word in this op-ed. Tonight is a sad replay but seems even worse as US officials had since convinced the SDF that we planned to stay. https://t.co/LL7Jaf2CIB \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) October 7, 2019\n\nBottom line: Trump tonight after one call with a foreign leader provided a gift to Russia, Iran, and ISIS. FWIW, I warned of this here in @ForeignAffairs \u2014 and recommended alternatives given the hard realities on the ground and in this White House. https://t.co/QHYzI7dgEi \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) October 7, 2019\n\nEven Brian Kilmeade, co-host of Trump\u2019s favorite morning show, \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d was sharply critical of the president.", "description": "Some of President Trump\u2019s closest allies have condemned the withdrawal of the U.S. military from Syria at the apparent request of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Christopher Wilson", "Senior Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o64qxOqPy7wQA.91w6mcmQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/33c6d240-e90f-11e9-b5ef-691cef06cd35", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
