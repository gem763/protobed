After gaining over 4,000 receiving yards in his college career for the Aggies, Doss impressed at the Senior Bowl but went undrafted.\n\nJon Gruden coached Doss at the Senior Bowl and clearly liked what he saw. The Raiders signed Doss as an undrafted free agent and he had a solid preseason showing, catching 17 passes for 162 yards and a touchdown. That wasn't enough to make the initial 53-man roster, though.\n\nStory continues\n\nDoss being cut by the Raiders was a bit of a surprise, but more than anything, it made a lot of fans sad after watching him on HBO's \"Hard Knocks.\" The 23-year-old became a bit of a star on the show as a local product from Alameda.\n\n\"I can't say enough good things about 'Hard Knocks.' They've been nothing but professional the whole time,\" Doss said. \"Great dudes. I'm just happy to be a part of it. I take it as a chance to showcase myself and it was a great experience.\"\n\n[RELATED: Tracking Raiders practice squad after 53-man roster cuts]\n\nDoss said he wouldn't trade his preseason experience with the Raiders for anything. The Raiders told him he was one of their last cuts and they hope to have him on the practice squad to develop him into an NFL player.\n\nThat won't happen, however, as a source has told NBC Sports California's Scott Bair that Doss has signed with the Jaguars' practice squad.\n\nKeelan Doss reacts to Raiders cutting him, praises 'Hard Knocks' crew originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "Hours after being cut by the Raiders, former UC Davis wide receiver Keelan Doss reacted to the news.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/42jpozX88B2MQJ2QfBA12g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7kn3H43vrbvkHnzM9tEMlg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/775c348e82c567db702964d42432af4c"}
