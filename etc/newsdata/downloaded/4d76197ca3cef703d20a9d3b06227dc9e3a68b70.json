This is what it would mean.", "language": "en", "text": "Australia is headed out to the economic unknown for the first time. (Photo by Paul Kane, Getty Images)\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut the official cash rate on Tuesday to 0.75%, and gave its strongest indication now that it might go to 0%.\n\nIn a statement, RBA governor Philip Lowe said full employment was the central bank\u2019s main economic objective, indicating that it would do what is needed to get unemployment to 4.5%.\n\nWith unemployment at 5.3% and rising, and cuts alone unlikely to get it there without some economic good luck, that could see the interest rate go to 0%.\n\nBefore this year, the cash rate had never strayed below 1.5%, meaning the RBA is entering unchartered territory in doing so. This is how things could pan out as rates go lower.\n\nIt\u2019s happening. After years of interest rates being on hold, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has thrown caution to the wind and looks to be cutting the cash rate towards 0%.\n\nThe man ultimately responsible for it is RBA Governor Philip Lowe. In his most recent cut, Lowe confirmed for the first time that the top priority of the RBA is achieving full employment \u2013 considered an unemployment level of 4.5%.\n\n\u201c[We are] prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and the achievement of the inflation target over time,\u201d Lowe said.\n\nThe problem with that is further interest rate cuts are pretty unlikely to get Australian there with unemployment currently sitting at 5.3%. While cuts may have helped support strong job growth, unemployment has just kept ticking up despite them.\n\nREAD MORE: Australian unemployment has just shot up to a 12 month high \u2013 and it\u2019s the \u2018smoking gun\u2019 the RBA needs to cut rates\n\nIf the RBA goes on cutting then to find full employment, it is quite possible it will hit 0% and still be looking. Indeed, Lowe has flagged that very possibility before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible we end up at the zero lower bound although I think it\u2019s unlikely,\u201d Lowe told the Federal government back in August.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared to do unconventional things if the circumstances warranted it,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope we can avoid that.\u201d\n\nFast-forward a couple of months though and that last sentiment looks like wishful thinking. Tuesday\u2019s rate cut brought the official cash rate in Australia to 0.75%.\n\nSo what happens if it keeps cutting?\n\nThe interest rate affects your money and your wealth in many different ways\n\nThe official interest rate is the one the RBA charges your bank to borrow money which it then loans to you.\n\nAs it cuts the rate, it effectively makes money cheaper, with the banks expected \u2014 but not required \u2014 to pass on the changes to you, their customers. This affects you in two major ways.\n\nFirstly, the lower the interest rate goes, the less interest you earn on your savings. Before the last cut, all the big four banks were already paying little interest on deposits at all. As more cuts are made, savings will struggle to grow at all. In fact, after you consider inflation, savings are far more likely to actually shrink in real terms as the cost of living rises.\n\nIf a 0% interest rate is implemented, the bank is unlikely to pay you at all for having your money with them, leaving you with less incentive to save.\n\nThe other big impact is on mortgages. As rates go lower, banks tend to slash their own rates. However as the official rate nears zero it becomes less likely those cuts are passed on, even partially because banks\u2019 profit margins start to suffer. That was evident in October\u2019s cut, with the big four only passing on around half of the cut.\n\nREAD MORE: The big banks are refusing to pass on the RBA\u2019s interest rate cut in full \u2013 and the government isn\u2019t happy about it\n\nAs 0% draws closer, it\u2019s unlikely Australians will even receive that. Instead, interest rates are likely to plateau sooner rather than later.\n\nAustralia has never even been close to a 0% interest rate before\n\nThere\u2019s serious concern about where the Australian economy is headed and for proof, you need not long any further than the falling rate, currently at 0.75%.\n\nAt the start of June, it was twice that \u2014 1.5%. In fact, the RBA\u2019s June cut was the central bank\u2019s first in almost three years and gave Australia its lowest cash rate in history.\n\nThe official cash rate (Source: RBA)\n\nThat record didn\u2019t last long. It\u2019s been slashed twice more since, with the October cut bringing it below 1% for the first time ever. The consensus is now that the RBA will cut again, either at its November meeting or, more likely, in February to 0.5%.\n\nNegative interest rates are possible but unlikely\n\nWhile Lowe has suggested negative interest rates could be implemented, it remains more probable that the RBA will stop before that.\n\nIf it did cut into negative territory, things start to go a little topsy turvy.\n\nREAD MORE: The RBA is now considering the drastic measure of negative interest rates \u2014 meaning you could be paid to borrow money from the bank\n\nThe RBA doesn\u2019t want to keep cutting rates, fearing it might create a housing bubble.\n\nLowe has signalled it doesn\u2019t want to cut, but without the government increasing its spending it has no choice but to stimulate the economy.\n\n\u201cQuite simply, the economy requires more stimulus. Ideally, the federal government would rise to the occasion. Fiscal policy can be better targeted in the current environment and could stimulate the economy without pushing house prices and debt higher,\u201d Indeed Asia-Pacific economist Callam Pickering said in a note issued to Business Insider Australia.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, a budget surplus has been placed ahead of jobs and growth The RBA will have to make do with their imperfect policy tool.\u201d\n\nCutting rates is an \u201cimperfect\u201d tool because by making borrowing cheaper, it increases the amount of money that flows into the real estate market. The RBA has warned repeatedly that it fears creating a housing bubble by doing so.\n\nIf the economy worsens still, the RBA could begin using quantitative easing\n\nIf rates go to 0% and the economy is still faltering, then the RBA could choose to use another unconventional tool known as quantitative easing, or QE.\n\nEssentially, it involves the RBA buying government bonds and increasing the amount of money in circulation. Despite being used overseas, in the US, Japan, and Europe, the jury is still out on just how effective it is in helping the economy grow.\n\nLowe has indicated he would be reluctant to use it but would consider doing so if required.\n\n\u201cBank officials are reluctant to discuss quantitative easing but it becomes a real possibility the closer we come to a cash rate of 0%,\u201d Pickering said. \u201cIn the absence of meaningful fiscal stimulus, quantitative easing may soon be inevitable.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unless the economy suddenly improves, Lowe might not have a choice.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
