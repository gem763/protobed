Sign up here.\n\nThe global economy flashed clearer warning signs on Tuesday as a wave of data showed manufacturing stuck in a slump, exports falling and sentiment sliding.\n\nIn the U.S., a closely watched factory index unexpectedly dropped to the lowest since 2009 -- driving down stocks as well as yields on Treasuries. Meanwhile the specter of deflation resurfaced as South Korea, a bellwether for international trade, reported a drop in consumer prices and the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its interest rate to a record low.\n\nWith a trade war between the U.S. and China still raging, industry executives from Germany to Japan and Russia complained of contracting business, and the World Trade Organization cut its forecast for commerce to the lowest in a decade.\n\nAlthough a measure of Chinese manufacturing improved and consumer spending globally has largely held strong, the overall tone sounded of the world economy failing to rebound amid mounting trade tensions and rising Brexit risks.\n\nThat leaves the U.S. and China and also the U.K. and European Union under pressure to resolve their differences, with central bankers and governments also having to find ways to support demand.\n\n\u201cThere can be few precedents since the 1930s of global growth prospects being affected so significantly by trade policy disruptions,\u201d Fitch Ratings Ltd. Chief Economist Brian Coulton said.\n\nUBS Group AG economists reckon global growth is tracking just 2.3% at the moment, almost a percentage point less than at the start of the third quarter. Those at Danske Bank are warning there is a 30% chance of a global recession in the next two years. A global manufacturing gauge improved slightly in September, but employment fell for a fifth month.\n\nWhile trade tensions are part of the story, there are also industry-specific issues -- autos in Germany, semiconductors in South Korea -- adding to the hurdles.\n\nGerman car-parts giant Continental AG last month laid out a sweeping restructuring plan that could affect as many as 20,000 jobs worldwide. Japan\u2019s Kawasaki Heavy Industries cut its forecasts, citing sales to chipmakers.\n\nCentral banks around the world are fighting the slowdown with new interest-rate cuts and monetary stimulus. But they are also ramping up calls on governments to jump in with fiscal measures, saying they can\u2019t do all the heavy lifting.\n\nIn the meantime, global bond investors are betting against a meaningful inflation pickup. Even with sovereign yields below zero, they are still piling into government debt, and so-called deflation trades are on the rise.\n\nRead More...\n\nDeflation Trades Reveal Investors\u2019 Fading Faith in Central BanksLowe Says Monetary Policy Is Working as RBA Joins Race to BottomU.S. Payrolls Set the Tone for Next Fed Countdown: Economy Week\n\nThe latest purchasing managers indexes may reinforce those views. German manufacturers cut prices in September by the most in more than three years. In Japan, where manufacturing sentiment is declining, factories lowered selling prices for a fourth straight month. British companies warned of \u201cBrexit uncertainty and clients routing supply chains away from the U.K.\u201d\n\nSuch an environment is worrying for central bankers in a world where inflation is already low and well short of targets. Consumer-price growth in the euro area slipped below 1% in September for the first time since 2016, falling further from the European Central Bank\u2019s goal.\n\nParts of the global economy still show resilience, and services are still growing. U.S.-China trade negotiations remain critical for the outlook, with a Chinese delegation set to visit Washington for talks this month aimed at hammering out a deal.\n\nThe decline in U.S. manufacturing is an \u201camber light on the dashboard,\u201d John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, said on Bloomberg Television. \u201cThe Fed is very likely to cut again at the end of October as a result of this and so long as the trade-war situation remains as an overhang.\u201d\n\n(Updates with markets in second paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Fergal O'Brien in Zurich at fobrien@bloomberg.net;Michelle Jamrisko in Singapore at mjamrisko@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Stirling at cstirling1@bloomberg.net, Scott Lanman\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
