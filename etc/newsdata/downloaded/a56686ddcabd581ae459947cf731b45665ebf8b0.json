His opponents called him \u201cunfit to serve\u201d and shouted for his resignation.\n\n[After Supreme Court defeat, Boris Johnson taunts Parliament]\n\nJohnson drew particular fury over his remarks about Jo Cox, a Labour lawmaker and Brexit opponent who was murdered days before a June 2016 referendum by a far-right domestic terrorist who yelled \u201cBritain first!\u201d before shooting and stabbing her to death.\n\nTracy Brabin, the Labour politician who holds Cox\u2019s former seat, was among the lawmakers who took issue with Johnson\u2019s refusal to say the \u201cBenn Act,\u201d as others did, to describe the legislation that requires him to seek a Brexit extension if he hasn\u2019t struck a deal with the E.U. by Oct. 19. Instead, Johnson called it the \u201cSurrender Act,\u201d \u201cHumiliation Act\u201d and \u201cCapitulation Act.\u201d\n\nBrabin said using those phrases suggested that those who disagree with Johnson are traitors, not patriots.\n\n\u201cPlease, please, will he going forward moderate his language, so we will all feel secure when we are going about our jobs?\u201d she pleaded.\n\nJohnson responded that the best way to honor Cox\u2019s memory would be to \u201cget Brexit done.\u201d\n\nIn another exchange, Labour lawmaker Paula Sherriff said, \u201cWe should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like.\u201d\n\nGesturing toward a wall plaque honoring Cox, she said: \u201cWe stand here, Mr. Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend, with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day. And let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words \u2018Surrender Act, betrayal, traitor,\u2019 and I for one am sick of it. We must moderate our language, and it has to come from the prime minister first.\u201d\n\nJohnson responded that he had \u201cnever heard such humbug in all my life.\u201d\n\n\n\nCandles surround a photo of the late Labour lawmaker Jo Cox before a vigil in her memory on June 17, 2016, in Glasgow, Scotland. (Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)\n\nCox\u2019s widower, Brendan Cox, said there were reckless words on both sides of the debate. There was a vicious cycle, he told the BBC on Thursday, \u201cwhere language gets more extreme, response gets more extreme. . . . The reason it matters is because it has real-world consequences.\u201d\n\nCox said: \u201cI was genuinely shocked by the willingness to descend to vitriol, because I think it does long-lasting harm. To have this debate descend into this bear pit of polarization, I think it\u2019s dangerous for our country.\u201d\n\nRachel Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s sister, an author and politician who opposes Brexit, called her brother\u2019s remarks \u201ctasteless.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cI think it was particularly tasteless for those who are grieving a mother, MP and friend to say the best way to honor her memory is to deliver the thing she and her family campaigned against \u2014 Brexit.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cmy brother is using words like \u2018surrender\u2019 and \u2018capitulation\u2019 as if the people standing in the way of the blessed will of the people, as defined by the 17.4 million votes in 2016, should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered. I think that is highly reprehensible.\u201d\n\nIn an aside, Rachel Johnson suggested \u2014 without citing any evidence \u2014 that her brother\u2019s antagonistic strategy could reflect anything from the influence of his anti-establishment advisers to pressure \u201cfrom people who have invested billions in shorting the pound\u201d and want to profit from the possible economic havoc of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nNicholas Soames, an independent lawmaker and grandson of Johnson\u2019s idol, Winston Churchill, told broadcasters that Johnson was stoking further divisions in a country already deeply divided over \u00adBrexit.\n\n\u201cI believe the job of the prime minister, even under very difficult circumstances, is to try and bring the country together, and what the prime minister did yesterday was to drive it further apart.\u201d\n\n[Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson to be expelled from Conservative Party for voting against Boris Johnson on Brexit]\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t seem to be backing down \u2014 much \u2014 on Thursday. In an interview with the BBC, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to call the Surrender Act what it is,\u201d in a metaphorical way. He added, \u201cTempers do need to calm down and people need to come together.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that \u201cit\u2019s only by getting Brexit done, that you\u2019ll actually lance the boil, as it were, about the current anxiety.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to respond in Parliament to an \u201curgent question\u201d about his use of allegedly inflammatory language, Johnson sent a junior minister.\n\nIt is true that the British Parliament is not a place for the thin-skinned. The weekly Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the House of Commons can be entertaining sport, a session often marked by cutting, even cruel, put-downs, in a contest of carefully crafted insult directed at \u201cthe right honorable gentleman.\u201d But there are limits.\n\nJohnson said he was well within the unwritten rules. Many of his colleagues think he went too far.\n\nJohnson, like President Trump, has a reputation for blunt talk \u2014 and he regularly gets himself in trouble. During his first Prime Minister\u2019s Questions earlier this month, Johnson was asked to apologize for his previous writings that compared Muslim women in Britain who wear a niqab to \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say Johnson knows exactly what he is doing. His strategy, they say, is to set up a \u201cpeople versus Parliament\u201d election, where the Latin-quoting, Eton- and Oxford-educated Johnson would run against his fellow elites who stand opposed to \u201cthe will of the people.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson leaves Downing Street on Thursday.

But many think an election could follow soon after.\n\nJohnson says he seeks to cut a deal to leave the E.U. in orderly fashion. But his abrasive style seems almost designed to alienate lawmakers whose support he will need if he hopes to pass a withdrawal deal through the House of Commons.\n\n[U.K. Supreme Court rules Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended Parliament illegally]\n\nSeveral lawmakers, along with their staffers and family members, shared anecdotes of how they felt personally threatened in the current environment.\n\nEllie Cooper, the daughter of the Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper, wrote on Twitter about being \u201cscared when our house gets fitted with panic buttons, industrial-locking doors and explosive bags to catch the mail.\u201d\n\nNicky Morgan, who serves in Johnson\u2019s cabinet, tweeted: \u201cI know the PM is aware of & sympathetic about the threats far too many of us have received because I shared with him recently the threats I am getting. But at a time of strong feelings we all need to remind ourselves of the effect of everything we say on those watching us.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nIn or out?
