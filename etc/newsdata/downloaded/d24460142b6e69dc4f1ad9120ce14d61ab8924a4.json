Liberals are not the majority in this country. And this issue, which is a top concern among this insufferable bunch, isn\u2019t ranked as part of the plethora of issues that normal voters view as a top concern. CNN\u2019s global warming town hall event, which lasted an agonizing seven hours, ranked dead last among cable news broadcasts for its entire duration. The \u2018ban all the things\u2019 event began at 5 P.M last night. It was a full-blown clown show where the 2020 Democratic candidates expounded on how they will pretty much wreck the economy with trillions in green pie-in-the-sky proposals, coupled by the complete and total overhaul on how Americans live their lives. No more burgers, no more air travel, no more internal combustion engines, etc., it\u2019s what the Left has always wanted: utter domination of the socio-political sphere. This draconian action item isn\u2019t popular, so they put an environmental mask on it. Population control was pushed. It was utter lunacy, but luckily only 1.1 million people watched (via Washington Examiner):\n\nAn average of 1.1 million viewers means that roughly 0.33% of the U.S. population watched CNN's 7-hour town hall on climate change. https://t.co/tOPv76gpNf \u2014 Siraj Hashmi (@SirajAHashmi) September 5, 2019\n\nWhile CNN marketed their seven-hour climate town hall forum with many of the Democratic presidential candidates as \"unprecedented,\" the network was in last place in total viewership between Fox News and MSNBC. The town hall started at 5:00 p.m. and went until midnight on Wednesday. Fox News was in first place during the seven-hour time slot, averaging 2.5 million viewers and MSNBC averaging 1.7 million viewers. CNN only averaged 1.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. For the 25-54 age demographic, Fox News also came in first with 418,000 viewers. CNN was in second with 265,000 viewers and MSNBC in third with 246,000. During prime time, 8-11p.m., Fox News averaged 3.2 million viewers and MSNBC averaged 2.2 million viewers. CNN averaged 1.4 million viewers, but once again came in second for the age demo with 345,000 viewers. Fox News had 530,000 viewers and MSNBC had 315,000.\n\nFormer Obama adviser David Axelrod lamented that when you run for president, you should at least have a pulse on what voters want. He was referring to the Democratic plans to give health care to illegals and pushing an open borders agenda\u2014none of which is popular. Maybe add global warming to the list as well.", "description": ".09/06/2019 8:07:07AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/354/63b3af8d-4413-480e-867d-76bb1e91edfa.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
