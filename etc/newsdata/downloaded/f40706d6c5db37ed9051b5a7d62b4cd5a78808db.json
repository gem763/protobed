It would also allow the gold miner to potentially shift its primary listing away from Johannesburg to London or Toronto.\n\nAngloGold said it would update investors on South African asset sales by the end of the year. Investors are particularly keen to see the producer exit South Africa because that would remove a discount that AngloGold trades at to global peers such as Barrick Gold Corp.", "description": "AngloGold Ashanti said it has advanced its South African asset-sale process and is currently examining a number of bids from investors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_4.5152%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a58729c4a2367c03104cb21240e7422af5d675b9", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
