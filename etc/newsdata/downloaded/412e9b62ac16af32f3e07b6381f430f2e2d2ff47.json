It is an independent municipality in Los Angeles County. The story has been corrected.\n\nFred Uriarte Fred Uriarte and his girlfriend.\n\nFred Uriarte found love twice in Mexico.\n\nFirst with the country itself, then with a Mexican woman he met at a party.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from his life in Los Angeles right before he left for Mexico in 2015. The 66-year-old former aerospace management professional had recently gotten a divorce and sold his home and was temporarily living at his sister\u2019s house while he figured things out. \u201cIt was kind of depressing. Here I am 60 years old, living in my sister\u2019s spare bedroom with my belongings in an 8-by-10 storage unit.\u201d\n\nThen a friend invited him to visit her in Akumal, Mexico \u2014 a little town about 25 miles from Playa del Carmen, a popular tourist spot on the Caribbean. \u201cShe was living in this condo on the beach. You walk in and there are sliding glass doors that look at the water. Her backyard was the Caribbean,\u201d recalls Uriarte, who\u2019d always dreamed of a house on the beach. It was on that day he decided the next chapter of his life would be in Mexico, where he\u2019d spent two years of his childhood.\n\nHe moved in January 2015 to Akumal \u2014 \u201cI spent that first seven months at the beach every day,\u201d Uriarte says \u2014 and in 2016 he moved to Playa del Carmen to be closer to restaurants and friends and meet more people. (\u201cThere\u2019s only so much self-reflection you can do,\u201d he jokes of his beach-combing life in Akumal.) It was there that he began volunteering at the Keep Kids in School Project (KKIS), an organization that helps raise money to send children to high school (public education is not free in Mexico, thanks to the myriad extras like uniforms, textbooks, supplies and fees that many families have to pay) and college. And it was there he met his now-girlfriend.\n\nFred Uriarte\n\n\u201cWe had both been invited to an expat going-away party by mutual friends. I was sitting alone at a table. and she came over and began speaking English to me. I spoke back in Spanish, and she was surprised. We just hit it off.\u201d\n\nThe couple has now moved with her teenage son to Quer\u00e9taro, a gorgeous city lined with historic colonial architecture (the city center is a UNESCO world heritage site) that has a fast-growing aerospace industry. (Uriarte hopes to start consulting soon.) It\u2019s a sophisticated city with lots of shopping, art galleries and museums, numerous hospitals, award-winning restaurants and multiple universities.\n\nHere\u2019s what their life is like in Quer\u00e9taro \u2014 from costs to health care and safety to residency and daily life:\n\niStock Quer\u00e9taro at sunset.\n\nThe cost: \u2018Living here cut my cost of living by at least half\u2019\n\nLife in California \u2014 Uriarte lived in Redondo Beach, in Los Angeles County \u2014 was extremely expensive, in terms of taxes, real estate and car expenses, insurance, and other costs. Moving to Mexico cut Uriarte\u2019s living costs \u201cby at least half,\u201d he says. Out of 315 cities that Expatistan ranks, Quer\u00e9taro ranks as the 245th cheapest, and International Living estimates that monthly costs for a couple living pretty modestly are under $2,000 a month.\n\nBy the numbers: Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico\n\nPopulation 640,000 Weather Typically between 42\u00b0F and 85\u00b0F\n\nSources: Google, WeatherSpark\n\nUriarte\u2019s biggest monthly expense is rent: Uriarte, his girlfriend and her son now live in a four-bedroom modern home in a gated community in a high-end neighborhood for $1,600 a month. The water bill is about $25 a month, and electricity is between $75 and $100 a month. Food, he says, costs probably 60% of what it costs in the U.S.; groceries for three people for the week costs about $75 to $100 \u2014 and that\u2019s shopping at a Whole Foods\u2013like grocery store. Going out to eat is also cheaper: A casual lunch with a glass of wine might cost $10 per person; a nice dinner with a glass of wine might cost $30 or $35 and at a super-high-end spot $75, he says. Car insurance costs about $700 a year, and, though Uriarte says that gas is a bit more expensive than in the U.S., he doesn\u2019t drive as often so he spends much less.\n\nMonthly cost of living: Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico\n\nRent (two-bedroom apartment) $750 Utilities $80 High-speed internet $30 Two cell phones $25 Groceries/household items $300 Entertainment $150 Health care for two $80 Incidentals $150 TOTAL $1,565\n\nSource: International Living\n\nOne other big expense is travel. Uriarte goes back to the U.S. see his four daughters and grandkids at least once a year. \u201cOne of the advantages of living in Quer\u00e9taro is that I can fly roundtrip to Tijuana for about $300 and walk across to the U.S. via the new border bridge (CBX) directly from the airport,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce across on the U.S. side I can rent a car or take public transportation to the train station in San Diego,\u201d which, he says, beats landing at LAX. He notes that \u201cQuer\u00e9taro has an international airport with several flights to U.S. cities, but the cost is about $700 to $900 U.S.\u201d\n\nHealth care\n\nThough you can buy health insurance in Mexico that\u2019s a lot cheaper than in the U.S., says Uriarte, he\u2019s opted to get medevac insurance, which will evacuate a policyholder via air ambulance or another fast transport mode in an emergency.\n\nUriarte pays roughly $500 a year for that insurance, he says. He also has Medicare, so he can see his doctors in the U.S. using that coverage.\n\nWhile in Mexico, for smaller checkups and other for services, Uriarte pays out of pocket. Care, he says, has been good as well as cheaper than it would be in the U.S. A checkup in Mexico costs him about $60 or $70. When he returns to the U.S., he sees his longtime doctors and refills his prescriptions. There are multiple hospitals in Quer\u00e9taro.\n\niStock Evening in Quer\u00e9taro.\n\nSafety\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt threatened,\u201d says Uriarte. He says that, while he lives in a gated community with a 24/7 guard, his children in Los Angeles live behind gates, too. Quer\u00e9taro is known as one of the safer cities in Mexico. \u201cI feel very comfortable here,\u201d Uriarte says.\n\nResidency\n\nUriarte recommends expats who are considering moving to Mexico become permanent residents, as it \u201cmakes life a little less complicated when renting or buying a house, applying for a driver\u2019s license or opening a bank account,\u201d he says. He applied about two years ago and says the whole process took him a little over a month and cost about $100 (for an immigration specialist to help him).\n\nDaily life\n\nThough Uriarte hopes to start consulting in the aerospace industry, the area in which he formerly worked, he\u2019s kept busy separate from that. He\u2019s on the board at KKIS, the organization he volunteered with in Playa, he\u2019s taken up woodworking, and he\u2019s very involved in the expat community, including organizing events. \u201cMy life is pretty busy,\u201d he reports. \u201cThe days go by really fast. Life tends to present you with opportunities if you\u2019re open to them.\u201d\n\nWhat to know before moving to Mexico\n\n\u201cYou do need to understand that life in Mexico is not always what it is in the U.S.,\u201d says Uriarte, who has seen some people relocate south only to head home to the U.S. in short order. \u201cWhen you\u2019re going to the bank, to the grocery store, you\u2019re going to wait in line,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s also a lot of traffic.\u201d The key to being happy in Mexico, says Uriarte, bilingual since childhood, is integrating yourself with the local community and picking a spot that you love, not just one that\u2019s got a low cost of living.\n\nBottom line\n\nUriarte doesn\u2019t have any plan to move back to the U.S. anytime soon, and that\u2019s a \u201cgrowing sentiment\u201d he\u2019s hearing from other expats, he says. \u201cWhy go back to the U.S. when I have everything here? The quality of life is good, [and] the cost of living is cheaper.\u201d", "description": "The costs, health care, safety and lifestyle in Queretaro, Mexico.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO257_fred_ZG_20190726125852.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-29"}
