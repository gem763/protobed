Most recently, a glass canopy at the same building, the Flats 8300 apartments at 8300 Wisconsin Ave., was discovered shattered Tuesday above the front entrance, along the same sidewalk as a school bus stop. Although the glass shattered, it did not fall.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGirl injured after glass panel falls from Bethesda apartment building\n\nOn July 7, part of a glass railing fell from an eighth-floor balcony of the 17-story Cheval Bethesda luxury condominiums at 4960 Fairmont Ave., at the corner of Old Georgetown Road.\n\nReports of falling glass first surfaced in spring 2017 at an office building at 4500 East-West Hwy. Three panels of the glass facade subsequently shattered and fell to the sidewalk, while eight other panels broke but did not fall. In May, the building owner, D.C.-based Carr Properties, agreed as part of a county inquiry to replace the type of glass panels found to have manufacturing defects.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the glass was all made by the same company because the owners of all three buildings declined to provide the name of their glass manufacturers to The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cWe need to get more answers,\u201d said Hadi Mansouri, acting chief of Montgomery\u2019s Department of Permitting Services. \u201cWhy all of a sudden it\u2019s happening is something we\u2019re trying to figure out. . . . It\u2019s a life and safety issue.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMansouri said the county hasn\u2019t determined who manufactured the glass.\n\nOfficials in Washington, Prince George\u2019s County and Northern Virginia said they couldn\u2019t recall any similar glass failures in recent years, and a search of international news coverage finds them to be relatively rare. However, the Bethesda incidents are similar to a case in Baltimore, where two people were injured in October after glass fell from a broken eighth-floor window in the 20-story Exelon Building downtown, according to news media reports.\n\nBuilding owner agrees to replace type of glass that fell onto sidewalks\n\nThe Bethesda cases have alarmed residents in an inner suburb undergoing a boom in high-rise construction, including several buildings with glass facades.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat are the odds that you\u2019d have three buildings in one downtown area that all have issues?\u201d said Bethesda resident Amanda Farber, who has been tracking the problem. \u201cI\u2019d like to know what the common denominator is. They\u2019ve all happened under different weather conditions and at different times of the year. Is it a defect with the glass itself?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPaige Coulman, another Bethesda resident, said she saw the pellets of glass rain down Aug. 22 on a group of about four adults and four children outside the Flats 8300 apartment building.\n\nCoulman, who was driving by, said she saw the group cover their heads and run across the street. On Tuesday morning, Coulman said, she was startled to see the shattered glass canopy at another entrance to the same building.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI thought, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Coulman said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nIn all of the incidents, Mansouri said, the glass fell in small pellets rather than in larger, more dangerous shards because the glass was tempered, as required by the international building code.\n\nAll three buildings now have scaffolding and overhead canopies protecting sidewalks below, some ordered by the county and some installed voluntarily by the building owners.\n\nAD\n\nIn the Baltimore case, the building owner, Baltimore-based Beatty Development Group, found probable manufacturing impurities in multiple glass panels, according to media accounts. A spokesman for the company was unavailable this week.\n\nAD\n\nA consultant for Carr found the same flaw \u2014 the presence of nickel sulfide \u2014 in glass that fell from the facade at 4500 East-West Hwy. When the glass production process is contaminated, tiny balls of nickel sulfide can form in the glass and, over time, cause the glass to crack or break without warning, according to experts.\n\nFor the third time, glass falls from Bethesda office building\n\nA consultant for Duball Fairmont, the Reston-based developer of the Cheval condo building, also found nickel sulfide as the likely cause of the balcony railing\u2019s July 7 break, according to a developer\u2019s memo sent to building residents.\n\nOne glass expert said finding out which company or companies manufactured the problematic glass will be key, particularly if nickel sulfide is found as the root cause in all three buildings.\n\nGeorge Dotzler, whose Miami company, Construction Research Laboratory, tests products used in building facades, said problems due to nickel sulfide were more common in the 1960s. However, he said, he\u2019s found them \u201cterribly infrequently\u201d since the 1970s, when U.S. glass manufacturers found ways to ensure nickel sulfide wasn\u2019t left behind.\n\nBut Dotzler said he\u2019s seen more cases in the past five to six years, all in glass manufactured by Chinese firms, often at a lower price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t happen with European or North American or even South American [glass] manufacturers,\u201d Dotzler said.\n\nDotzler, who emphasized that he had no knowledge of the Bethesda cases, said he would also want to know why the balcony glass fell after shattering.\n\n\u201cA properly designed railing, even if the grass breaks, shouldn\u2019t fall,\u201d Dotzler said.\n\nThe owners of all three buildings declined interviews but released statements.\n\nCarr, the owner of the office building at 4500 East-West Hwy., said it expects to replace the problematic glass over the next year.\n\nMarc Dubick, president of Duball, provided a detailed memo sent to Cheval residents about the broken balcony railing. The developer is replacing all of the building\u2019s glass railings \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d the memo said.\n\nAD\n\nMilton Schwarz, president of the Cheval condominium board, said he\u2019s pleased with the company\u2019s response.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese things happen,\u201d Schwarz said.\n\nGreenbelt-based Bozzuto, which manages the Flats 8300 apartments, said that in light of the shattered glass canopy discovered Tuesday, it is extending the building\u2019s protective scaffolding \u201cas an added precaution\u201d \u2014 something Mansouri said the county is also considering as an order.\n\n\u201cWe have been working closely with building engineers and materials scientists to diagnose the issue and investigate further,\u201d Bozzuto said in a statement.\n\nThe firm also has been in touch with the family of the injured 12-year-old girl, according to the statement.\n\n\u201cOur company was founded on the values of care and concern,\u201d Bozzuto said. \u201cAs the property manager, the safety of our residents and everyone who visits the community is our highest priority.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Glass pellets rained down recently from three buildings, in one case injuring a girl.", "authors": ["Katherine Shaver", "Reporter Covering Urban Planning", "Transportation Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iRj3POfl7nv_3t4eqq3MTK2tst0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SSMQDFGONEI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
