We believe the people of Tenea abandoned the city and fled to these hills here.'\n\nTHE HISTORY OF TENEA One famous description of Tenea comes from Pausanias 'Such is the account I heard of the Asopus. When you have turned from the Acrocorinthus into the mountain road you see the Teneatic gate and a sanctuary of Eilethyia. The town called Tenea is just about sixty stades distant. The inhabitants say that they are Trojans who were taken prisoners in Tenedos by the Greeks, and were permitted by Agamemnon to dwell in their present home. For this reason they honor Apollo more than any other god. Pausanias, Description of Greece\n\nThe dig team, led by one of Greece's top archaeologists, Eleni Korka, have their own theory to explain this mystery.\n\nMr Lagos said: 'we know Alaric, who was king of the Visigoths, raided Greece in 397AD, we discovered a coin that was issued by Alaric's people.'\n\nThey believe the city may have been abandoned in this period as Alaric destroyed the city to gain wealth and spread Christianity.\n\nEvidence of later habitation found by the team, around 200 years after this period, suggested that the city had lost its wealth as finds were less elaborate and more practical.\n\nMany references to the lost city of Tenea have been made in Greek myths and historical texts.\n\nOne notable one being the legend of Oedipus in which the king of Thebes kills his father and marries his mother - archaeologist Dr Korka claims there are rumours he was brought up in the city.\n\nDr Korka told the Telegraph: 'During the Roman years, Tenea cut coins. This shows full independence.'\n\nAmong the original finds Finds included walls and clay, marble or stone floors of buildings, as well as household pottery, a bone gaming die and more than 200 coins dating from the 4th century BC to late Roman times.\n\nFinds included walls and clay, marble or stone floors of buildings, as well as household pottery, a bone gaming die and more than 200 coins dating from the 4th century BC to late Roman times.\n\nArchaeologist Constantine Psychas (left) transports debris removed by a colleague from an ancient well found next to Roman baths in ancient Tenea\n\nThis drone photo shows the footprint of a Roman baths complex discovered in the ancient city of Tenea, Greece\n\nArchaeologist Constantine Psychas transports debris removed by a colleague from an ancient well 16 meters deep found next to Roman baths in ancient Tenea, Chiliomodi in Corinthia, Greece, 15 October 2019\n\nThe lower portion of Greek goddess Aphrodite, possibly Hellenistic, was found in an ancient well 16 meters deep\n\nThe first findings came to light in 1984 but excavations officially began in 2013 - excavations in the last two seasons identified the exact location of ancient Tenea, up to then known only from literary sources\n\nAmong the extravagant belongings were a pyxis - a round lidded vessel thought to have been used for cosmetics, jewellery and valuables.\n\nA roman lamp was also uncovered depicting the Trojan hero Aeneas carrying his father during the evacuation of Troy - the lamp would have been filled with some kind of oil and lit by a wick or strip of cloth.\n\nExperts from several specialities continue to work daily to revealing buildings of the ancient city of Tenea.\n\nA complex of Roman baths were unearthed revealing an area that would be used for social gathering and communal washing for residents of the city.\n\nBefore a license was granted for the dig in 2013 antiquities smugglers dug up two remarkable 6th century B.C. marble statues of young men in 2010 and tried to sell them for 10 million euros.", "description": "Mystery surrounds the city as\u00a0archaeologists\u00a0attempt to uncover why it was abandoned suddenly by unearthing artefacts from around 400AD when its inhabitants fled with no obvious explanation.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/14/20037034-0-image-a-99_1571751242037.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
