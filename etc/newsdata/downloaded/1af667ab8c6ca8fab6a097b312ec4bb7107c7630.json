And he persuaded Giuliani that she was a problem for him, too. And then Giuliani then persuaded the president.\n\n\"And it's sort of this unholy alliance \u2014 or unholy triad \u2014 that somehow managed to seize control of U.S. foreign policy with respect to Ukraine,\" Connolly continued. \"And as [Kent] said, the consequence would [be to] undermine 28 years of our efforts to promote the rule of law by actually doing something corrupt ourselves.\"\n\nA source familiar with the matter also said Kent testified that while the State Department viewed former prosecutor general Viktor Shotkin as corrupt, Lutsenko was considered to be just as bad.\n\nThe Virginia Democrat also underpinned growing scrutiny of individuals who circumvented the proper channels for carrying out Ukraine policy, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyHillicon Valley: Trump official declines to testify on trade protections for tech | Senators call for better info-sharing on supply chain threats | Apple pulls app after Chinese pressure Overnight Energy: Dems subpoena Perry in impeachment inquiry | EPA to overhaul rules on lead contamination tests | Commerce staff wrote statement rebuking weather service for contradicting Trump Commerce staff drafted statement rebuking weather service for contradicting Trump's hurricane predictions MORE, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, and former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerEx-Trump aide on Russia testifies for 10 hours as part of impeachment inquiry 10 top Republicans who continue to deny the undeniable Ex-Trump aide to tell Congress she objected to Ukrainian ambassador's removal: report MORE.\n\nKent described a May 23 meeting, organized by Mulvaney, where \u201cit was determined that ... responsibility for U.S.-Ukraine policy was to be transferred to three individuals: Volker, Sondland and Rick Perry James (Rick) Richard PerryThe Memo: Drip, drip of revelations damages Trump Overnight Energy: Advisory panel pushes park service to privatize campgrounds | Dems urge Perry to keep lightbulb efficiency rules | Marshall Islands declares national climate crisis Cracks emerge in White House strategy as witness testifies MORE,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nThe group dubbed themselves \u201cthe three amigos,\u201d Connolly continued, citing Kent.\n\n\u201cThey revealed that decision at a meeting with Zelensky in Kiev, I believe on June 2,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cAnd for some Americans from the embassy, that was news to them.\"\n\nConnolly was by far the most talkative participant in Tuesday\u2019s deposition. Other Democrats left the gathering saying broadly that Kent\u2019s testimony validates the whistleblower complaint, but without providing details.\n\nConnolly\u2019s detailed accounts, meanwhile, drew ire from House Republicans, who amplified their previous attacks that the Democrats\u2019 close-door impeachment strategy is undemocratic, denying the public a window into everything that\u2019s said \u2014 even as some Democrats leak select details.\n\n\u201cWhile we can\u2019t tell you anything that just happened, we get copies handed to us of Twitter feeds and how reports on substance are being put out,\u201d said GOP Rep.
