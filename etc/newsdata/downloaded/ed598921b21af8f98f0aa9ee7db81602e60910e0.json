REUTERS/Yusuf Ahmad\n\nLondon nickel leapt to a five-year high of $18,850 per tonne this month as Indonesia confirmed it would bring forward to next year a ban on exporting nickel ore.\n\nThat will cut off the major source of feed for China\u2019s nickel pig iron (NPI) producers.\n\nThis week\u2019s news that the Philippines will suspend indefinitely operations in the nickel mining hub of Tawi-Tawi province threatens supply from China\u2019s second largest ore supplier.\n\nBut rather than extending its super-charged rally, nickel has retreated from the highs in both London and Shanghai, a telling sign of bull exhaustion.\n\nThis particular chapter in the nickel story, nevertheless, is far from over, the original Shanghai surge morphing into a London squeeze.\n\nSHANGHAI SURGE ABATES\n\nShanghai has led London on the move higher, particularly during the ferocious rallies of Aug. 8 and 30, when much of the price action played out in the early hours of the London morning.\n\nThe Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) nickel contract saw both volumes and market open interest soar on the moves higher as speculators stampeded into the market.\n\nThat surge seems to be abating. Volumes remain elevated but market open interest has collapsed by almost 30% since the start of September, implying a wave of profit-taking.\n\nLondon too seems to have run out of upside momentum, with nickel sliding to $17,300.\n\nSpeculative long positioning on the LME nickel contract peaked last week at about 46% of open interest, the largest collective bull bet since September 2017, according to LME broker Marex Spectron. This had eased to 39% on Tuesday.\n\nThe fact that the price has fallen despite the latest threat to the supply chain suggests a market that had moved too aggressively ahead of fundamentals.\n\nLONDON SQUEEZE\n\nThe nickel action is far from finished in London, however.\n\nFocus has shifted from the outright price to time-spreads as the front part of the LME curve experiences its most acute tightness in a decade.\n\nThe benchmark cash-to-three-months time-spread flexed out to a backwardation of $163 per tonne last week.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s close cash metal was still commanding a significant $105 premium over the three-month price.\n\nSuch severe tightness is \u201csomething of an oddity\u201d, according to analysts at Citi (\u201cMetals Weekly\u201d, Sept. 3, 2019).\n\nThe Indonesian ore ban doesn\u2019t start until January, which allows exporters to maximise shipments over the remainder of the year.\n\nMoreover, China\u2019s NPI producers are holding \u201cample stocks\u201d of ore, providing some cushion against the supply-chain disruption expected next year.\n\nSupply \u201cdeficits in our numbers don\u2019t get massive until after 2021,\u201d according to Citi, which says the current squeeze is down to \u201cthe massive technical and trend buying congregating in the nearby monthly contracts\u201d and distorting the curve.\n\nThe bank also says the spreads blow-out could spur a reversal in the LME stocks downtrend as shorts are incentivised to deliver metal to the exchange.\n\nTESTING AVAILABILITY\n\nSuch deliveries are already taking place. After falling steadily over the last two years, LME inventory has staged a minor rebuild.\n\nA total 41,910 tonnes have entered the LME warehouse system since the beginning of August, when the front month of the LME curve first started tightening.\n\nPrior to August the cumulative inflow in the first seven months of the year was just 46,800 tonnes.\n\nSome of the impact has been mitigated by an acceleration in cancellations with the amount of metal earmarked for physical load-out surging by a net 22,500 tonnes last week and the ratio of cancelled tonnage jumping to 44%.\n\nThis is a key reason why the spreads remain as tight as they are with the market structure still incentivising more metal into the system.\n\nIt will be an interesting test of physical market availability since there is an analysts\u2019 consensus that part of the previous strong drawdown in LME stocks was down to off-market stockbuilding.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that some of this shadow stock has already re-appeared. The only question is how much more is \u201cout there\u201d. Citi\u2019s tentative answer is around 350,000 tonnes, which together with visible exchange stocks, means around 600,000 tonnes of total stocks, equivalent to 12 weeks\u2019 global usage.\n\nREALITY CHECK\n\nStocks form one part of the multi-dimensional puzzle as to how the global supply chain will deal with the loss of Indonesian ore.\n\nThe Philippines is part of the answer but the country\u2019s nickel production is itself a moving target given the rolling suspensions of local miners for environmental checks.\n\nSo too is supply from alternative sources such as Papua New Guinea, where the Ramu mine is facing its own environmental pressures.\n\nHowever, the newsflow is not uniformly bullish.\n\nBrazil\u2019s Vale, for example, has just received permission to reactivate its 25,000-tonne per year Onca Puma ferronickel operations.\n\nThen there is the problem of demand.\n\nNickel\u2019s future demand boost from electric vehicles may have lit the bull fires in the market but for now nickel\u2019s fortunes are still beholden to the stainless steel sector.\n\nSo far this year a super-strong Chinese market has offset stainless steel weakness just about everywhere else.\n\nBut analysts at Argonaut point out that China\u2019s stainless inventory has been rapidly building which is \u201cnot a positive development for the nickel price outlook\u201d. (\u201cNickel: More Price Consolidation Ahead\u201d, Sept. 19. 2019)\n\nThe combination of resilient Chinese demand for stainless steel, the accumulation of supply threats and a speculative surge has helped nickel escape the broader macroeconomic gloom and comfortably outperform every other LME-traded base metal so far this year.\n\nA reality check may be overdue, particularly if Chinese stainless production weakens in the weeks ahead and more metal is drawn into the exchange light by the current LME backwardation.\n\nMake no mistake, the Indonesian ore ban has upended the supply landscape with just about every analyst revising upwards their price forecasts over the coming years.\n\nBut no market moves in a straight line. Not even nickel.\n\nThe opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.", "description": "There's only so much bullish news even the red-hot nickel market can absorb.", "authors": ["Andy Home", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431648043&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1EG", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
