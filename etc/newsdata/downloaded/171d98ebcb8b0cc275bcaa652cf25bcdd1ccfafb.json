Described as a \"candid and intimate narrative,\" Woods' memoir will cover his rise to fame, battling injuries and personal issues as well as his comeback at age 43, winning the Masters in April. It was not announced when the book would be released.\n\n\"I've been in the spotlight for a long time, and because of that, there have been books and articles and TV shows about me, most filled with errors, speculative and wrong,\" Woods said. \"This book is my definitive story. It's in my words and expresses my thoughts. It describes how I feel and what's happened in my life. I've been working at it steadily, and I'm looking forward to continuing the process and creating a book that people will want to read.\"", "description": "Tiger Woods will be the author of a new book.", "authors": ["Jill Martin"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190415144346-tiger-woods-masters-augusta-green-jacket-jack-nicklaus-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
