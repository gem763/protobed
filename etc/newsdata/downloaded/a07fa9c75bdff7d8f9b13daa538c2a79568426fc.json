It lays out about eight violations of the United States Constitution about six violations of the President\u2019s civil rights, my civil rights, Attorney General Barr\u2019s civil rights. I never wanted in my life want to appear to at a Salem Witch Trial, which would actually be fairer than this.\n\nIt\u2019s a process without any due process and the fact it\u2019s being enabled by a completely corrupt press corps. I don\u2019t know. Do you think we are going to hear on the press that a member of the parliament in Ukraine held a press conference today? The name was Andriy Derkach. You won\u2019t hear this on the news, ladies, and gentlemen because they censor it.\n\nYou only hear the news that Dems want you to hear. Derkach publicized documents which he said describe the mechanism getting money by Biden, Sr. This was a transfer of funds for lobbying activities as investigators believe to Joe Biden through a lobbying company.\n\nThe funds and amount of $900,000, were transferred to the U.S. based company Rosemont Seneca which according to open sources, is affiliated with Biden. The payment reference was for consultative services. Then it goes on to describe another $16.5 million payment \u2014 apparently laundered payment \u2014 involving both Devon Archer and Hunter, using political and economic levers of power, influencing Ukrainian authorities, and manipulating the issue of providing financial aid, Joe Biden actively assisted closing criminal cases.\n\nThis is based on a statement today by a parliament member in the Ukraine, a very senior one, saying that Joe Biden actively assisted closing criminal cases into the activity of former Ukrainian Ecology Minister Mykola Zlochevsky, who is the founder and owner of Burisma Group.\n\nLet me tell you who are Mykola Zlochevsky are. He\u2019s a major oligarch. He stole $5 billion from his people. He very suspiciously was allowed to come back. His case got dismissed when they dismiss Hunter Biden\u2019s case,. He\u2019s the guy who paid the $16.5 million and the $900,000 to the Bidens \u2013 well, it wasn\u2019t $16.5 [million]. It was more $8 million to the Biden group.\n\nThis guy is one of the major criminals of the Ukraine, and he\u2019s now walking around free because Joe Biden got the case dismissed. This gentleman has said that this information should be turned over to the Department of Justice for their own purposes they should investigate it and I\u2019m going to tell you why Sean.\n\nBecause they suspect that the President of the Ukraine received a very major bribe in order to tank this case. I\u2019m not saying Biden was involved in the bride but it\u2019s the only thing he wasn\u2019t involved in. This case stinks, they can run away from it all they want. Sean, I want to keep your eye, not just on China. I want you to keep your eye on Romania. Just watch Romania.\n\nHANNITY: Let me ask you this\u2013\n\nGIULIANI: You won\u2019t read it in The New York Times or The Washington Post, but just watch Romania.", "description": "Wednesday on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity,\" former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is now serving as legal counsel for President Donald Trump decried congressional procedure regarding impeachment and called the Salem Witch Trials a \"fairer\" process. | Clips", "authors": ["Jeff Poor"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Giuliani109-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
