They had pushed for more representation of black students in advanced programs.\n\nThen, after the 2016 election, the bullying seemed to pick up, according to Phillip E. Thompson, former president of the Loudoun NAACP. The civil rights group alerted school officials, but he said he felt school officials ignored those warnings, permitting the climate to worsen.\n\n[\u2018Growing sense of despair\u2019: A wealthy, diversifying school system in suburban D.C. confronts racism and hate in schools]\n\n\u201cKids were starting to get a lot more pushy,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThey did nothing to stop it then.\u201d\n\nIn June , a review commissioned by the school system confirmed what Thompson and others had believed all along: Students of color had to operate within a \u201chostile learning environment.\u201d\n\nLast week, Loudoun School Board members condemned white supremacy and passed a resolution denouncing hate. They also vowed to eliminate \u201copportunity gaps\u201d for students from marginalized communities. In its declaration, the School Board also promised to work to address implicit biases in schools and to build a more diverse workforce.\n\nRob Doolittle, a spokesman for Loudoun County Public Schools, said the state changed reporting requirements between the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 school year that render it impossible to accurately compare the levels of bullying between those years.\n\nHowever, he added that \u201cone instance of bullying or harassment is one too many.\u201d\n\n\u201cLoudoun County Public Schools believes all students have the right to attend school where their individual differences are respected and where they are free of fear of harassment and bullying,\u201d Doolittle said.\n\nThe Equity Collaborative, a national consulting firm, conducted an assessment across the district in the spring. A report, based on interviews with several hundred students, teachers and staff at two dozen schools, found that students are forced into a \u201chostile learning environment\u201d because of the perception that there are no consequences for hateful actions.\n\nThe report documented many instances of racism, including a U.S.-born student who was told to go back to their country by a teacher and another incident in which a student said a teacher referred to all Arabs as terrorists.\n\nFour primary recommendations were issued as part of the review, including the suggestion that Superintendent Eric Williams issue a message to the community condemning white supremacy, hate speech and racially motivated violence. Williams released that statement in August.\n\nThe report also called for the school system to review or establish a policy for responding to racially motivated actions and state \u201cthat the N-word is not tolerated,\u201d as well as establish training opportunities for teachers and revamp its plans to improve diversity among the staff.\n\nThompson said the Loudoun NAACP spent years calling attention to racist experiences faced by students of color in the approximately 84,000-student school system, including incidents where schoolchildren were attacked online with slurs from their classmates.\n\nHe said the recent work in the school system has \u201cconfirmed a lot of what we\u2019ve been talking about for the last 20 years.\u201d The school system, he said, treated racial incidents in the past as isolated episodes, but the report \u201cblew it all out the water.\u201d\n\nLoudoun\u2019s focus on equity is unfolding during a period of dramatic demographic change and growth in the county; white students went from making up 63 percent of students in the 2008-2009 school year to 46 percent of enrollment this year.\n\nAsian students are 23 percent of Loudoun\u2019s school population, Hispanic students 18 percent, black students 7 percent and 6 percent of students identify as multiracial, school system data show.\n\nBrenda Sheridan, a Loudoun School Board member who co-chairs the Committee on Equity that drafted the resolution, acknowledged that some community members are frustrated the school system had not addressed the problems sooner, but she believes there is newfound momentum in the school system to grow.\n\n\u201cChange takes practice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to teach it and we have to practice it and we have to expand people\u2019s knowledge base.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA Virginia community steeped in Civil War lore grapples with a desire for change\n\nStudent exam scores in Virginia spark concerns about gaps\n\n\u2018Growing sense of despair\u2019: A wealthy, diversifying school system in suburban D.C. confronts racism and hate in schools\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Some community members said school officials permitted ignored incidents and allowed the climate to worsen.", "authors": ["Debbie Truong", "Reporter Covering Virginia Schools", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lO942C5RnxSj_NHyWW4Xx0QeT8Y=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H3PM2SXDUEI6JEC7ZSEW2N42GI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
