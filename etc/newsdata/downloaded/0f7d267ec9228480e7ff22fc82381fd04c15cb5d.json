One person was seen being handcuffed and taken away to a police van.\n\nAs the rally march set off, protest leaders carried a black banner that read, \u201cFive main demands, not one less,\u201d as they pressed their calls for police accountability and political rights in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\nSupporters sang the protest movement\u2019s anthem, waved colonial and U.S. flags, and held up placards depicting the Chinese flag as a Nazi swastika.\n\nMany protesters wore masks in defiance of a recently introduced ban on face coverings at public gatherings, and volunteers handed more out to the crowd.\n\nMatthew Lee, a university student, said he was determined to keep protesting even after more than four months.\n\n\u201cI can see some people want to give up, but I don\u2019t want to do this because Hong Kong is my home, we want to protect this place, protect Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t give up because Hong Kong is your home.\u201d\n\nSome front-line protesters barricaded streets at multiple locations in Kowloon, where the city\u2019s subway operator restricted passenger access.\n\nThey tore up stones from the sidewalk and scattered them on the road, commandeered plastic safety barriers and unscrewed metal railings to form makeshift roadblocks.\n\nA water cannon truck and armored car led a column of dozens of police vans up and down Nathan Road, a major artery lined with shops, to spray a stinging blue-dyed liquid as police moved to clear the road of protesters and barricades.\n\nAt one point, the water cannon sprayed a handful of people standing outside a mosque. Local broadcaster RTHK reported that the people hit were guarding the mosque and few protesters were nearby. The Hong Kong police force said it was an \u201cunintended impact\u201d of its operation to disperse protesters and later sent a representative to meet the mosque\u2019s imam.\n\nAs night fell, protesters returned to the streets, setting trash on fire at intersections.\n\nResidents jeered at riot police, cursing at them and telling them to leave. The officers, in turn, warned people that they were part of an illegal assembly and told them to leave, and unleashed tear gas to disperse the crowds.\n\nAlong the way, protesters trashed discount grocery shops and a restaurant chain because of what they say is the pro-Beijing ownership of the companies. They also set fire to ATMs and branches of mainland Chinese banks, setting off sprinklers in at least two, as well as a shop selling products from Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi.\n\nThe police used a bomb disposal robot to blow up a cardboard box with protruding wires that they suspected was a bomb.\n\nOrganizers said ahead of the march that they wanted to use their right to protest as guaranteed by Hong Kong\u2019s constitution despite the risk of arrest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using peaceful, rational, nonviolent ways to voice our demands,\u201d Figo Chan, vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of being arrested. What I\u2019m most scared of is everyone giving up on our principles.\u201d\n\nThe group has organized some of the movement\u2019s biggest protest marches. One of its leaders, Jimmy Sham, was attacked on Wednesday by assailants wielding hammers.\n\nOn Saturday, Hong Kong police arrested a 22-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a teenage activist who was distributing leaflets near a wall plastered with pro-democracy messages. A witness told RTHK that the assailant shouted afterward that Hong Kong is \u201ca part of China\u201d and other pro-Beijing messages.\n\nThe protest movement sprang out of opposition to a government proposal for an extradition bill that would have sent suspects to mainland China to stand trial, and then ballooned into broader demands for full democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.", "description": "Hong Kong streets descended into chaotic scenes following an unauthorized pro-democracy rally Sunday as protesters set up roadblocks and torched businesses...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT662_hkprot_ZG_20191020175458.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
