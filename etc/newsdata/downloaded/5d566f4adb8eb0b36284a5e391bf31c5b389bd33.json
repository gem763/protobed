Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that\u2019s not the position that you want to be in when you\u2019re, you know, I mean \u2026 It\u2019s like, we care about our country, and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and fight.\"\n\nFACEBOOK CEO ZUCKERBERG MEETS WITH TRUMP, KEY SENATORS ON DC SWING\n\nZuckerberg, who met with President Trump and several D.C. lawmakers last month, also reportedly said that the company's size has helped it fight election interference while noting that its rival, Twitter, has been inadequate at fighting interference because of fewer resources.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why Twitter can\u2019t do as good of a job as we can,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cI mean, they face, qualitatively, the same types of issues. But they can\u2019t put in the investment. Our investment on safety is bigger than the whole revenue of their company.\u201d\n\nFox News has reached out to Facebook for comment.\n\nWarren responded to the story, tweeting that the system that allows \"giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices\" needs to be fixed.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson described the D.C. meetings as \"good\" and \"constructive,\" aimed at \"meeting with policymakers to hear their concerns and talk about future Internet regulation.\" Trump also tweeted an image last month of himself shaking hands with Zuckerberg at the White House.\n\nIn March, Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic Senator from Massachusetts, put forth a plan that would break up the largest tech companies in the country, chiefly Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, saying the power they hold is too great.\n\n\"I want a government that makes sure everybody \u2014 even the biggest and most powerful companies in America \u2014 plays by the rules,\" Warren wrote in a blog post announcing her plan. \"And I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish. To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\"\n\nZUCKERBERG SAYS THERE 'CLEARLY WAS BIAS' IN CONTROVERSY OVER 'CENSORSHIP' OF PRO-LIFE GROUP LIVE ACTION\n\nIn her plan, Warren specifically mentioned that she wants to unwind Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, an idea that has gained traction on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nDuring his meetings with D.C. lawmakers, Zuckerberg met with Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has proposed a bill to ban features that enable limitless scrolling, autoplay and other addictive features on social media. Hawley said on Twitter that he asked the Facebook founder to show he was \"serious about bias, privacy & competition\" and sell WhatsApp and Instagram as well as submit to a third-party audit on censorship.\n\n\"He said no to both,\" Hawley tweeted.\n\nSen. Hawley has also announced legislation that would remove tech titans\u2019 protection from liability for third-party content on their platforms. Under the Ending Internet Censorship Act, these companies are able to \"retain Section 230 protections if they prove they are politically neutral to a third-party auditor,\" a Hawley spokesperson told Fox News.\n\nZuckerberg's visit to Washington came amid a fraught period for Facebook, with lawmakers calling for closer scrutiny of the company amid privacy and censorship bias concerns. Facebook currently faces an anti-trust probe led by state attorneys general as well as a separate antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nThat agency slapped Facebook with a $5 billion fine over the company\u2019s privacy policies, and the company agreed to enact new oversight on how the company utilizes user data.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThis story has been updated to include Elizabeth Warren's reponse.\n\nFox News' Morgan Phillis, James Rogers and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Leaked audio comments from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly include him saying that the tech company would\u00a0likely have no choice but to sue the U.S. government to stave off being broken up\u00a0if Elizabeth Warren becomes president.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/zuckerberg-getty-images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
