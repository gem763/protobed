It uprooted trees and pulled down power lines, leaving more than 200,000 people without power by Monday morning.\n\nGallant lives on the Avenger, moored in Lunenburg Harbour, N.S. While some left coastal areas to avoid Dorian, he decided to stay and ride out the storm.\n\nHe explained why to The Current's interim host Laura Lynch. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nTake us back to the height of the storm on Saturday night, and describe what it was like on board.\n\nIt was noisy. The wind was, the gusts were fairly powerful; powerful enough to make the boat lean over a little bit.\n\nThere were maybe 15 boats in the harbour, with maybe six of them with people aboard. We never moved from, you know, where we were hooked up.\n\nThe waterfront at Lunenburg Harbour in august 2018. Tom Gallant sad half a dozen people chose to stay with their boats as Dorian approached. (Andrew Vaughan/Canadian Press)\n\nAnd the harbour itself because of the wind, because of the wind direction \u2014 it was always coming off the land, so you don't have a long stretch of water between the land and you. So that can't build up big seas. ... For a hurricane, it was relatively peaceful.\n\nYou've ridden out storms before. I'm wondering, is there a part of you that considers a storm an adventure?\n\nNo, I just can't abide the idea that the boat would get in trouble and I wouldn't be here to help her. I mean she's my home, you know. I've had her since 1979 and sailed over 100,000 miles in her. And I love her.\n\nYou make sure that all of your mechanical systems are working, and you make sure that the rum keg is full. - Tom Gallant\n\nHave you spoken to friends and neighbours who are on the land?\n\nYeah and you know, look \u2014 we did well. The real damage was happening from kind of Peggy's Cove up towards Halifax and the Eastern Shore. And I understand it was pretty bad down in Shelburne too.\n\nThe peculiarities of where I am mean that the storm surge never did get in here. It was offshore, you know. It was only five miles away, but that's enough.\n\nSo you've spoken with people who are not doing nearly as well as you are at this point, I guess.\n\nWell I've met some folks who, you know, they don't have power yet. And there's a tree on their roof, and things like that, yeah.\n\nThe storm downed trees and power lines across the province. (Paul Palmeter/CBC)\n\nNow I don't mean to make light of this but because you're experienced, I'm wondering what kind of supplies you made sure you had, as you prepared for this?\n\nWell you have food and you have water. Of course you're not going to be affected by a power outage or anything like that because you're off grid anyway, so you have all your systems aboard. You get extra fuel, you make sure that all of your mechanical systems are working, and you make sure that the rum keg is full.\n\nAnd did the rum keg get tapped?\n\nIt certainly did! It's a stress management tool and quite a successful one.\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran. Produced by Mary-Catherine McIntosh.
