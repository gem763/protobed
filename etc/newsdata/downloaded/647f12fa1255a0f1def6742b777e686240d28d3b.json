This can't be right.\"\n\nHe also believes that works like these contribute to societal problems such as murder, and divisions, and will also cause seemingly inexplicable problems at the school.\n\nAnderson begged concerned people to raise their concerns with the school. His video has spread quickly.\n\nHe was of the view that there would have been strong backlash had the painting been about Islam.\n\nSome people applauded the school for allowing the pupil's work.\n\nBut others were on Anderson's side. At 547 comments and counting on the school's Facebook page, the debate was intense over whether the school should have allowed it.\n\nThe school told News24 in a statement that it welcomed any comment on the pupil's work.\n\nHowever, it asked that the work not be uploaded to social media without the school's consent because \"the project had to be understood within the context of the assigned theme\".\n\nThe artist's name was not immediately available, but the Zululand Observer reported that the pupil explained the artwork \"demonstrates organised religion's preoccupation with making money and its exploitation of those with blind faith\".\n\nIt reported that he said one of the pieces was symbolic of the lack of choice children have when born into and raised in a particular faith.\n\n\"Curro are cognisant of the allegations made on social media and the matter is currently subject to an internal investigation,\" the school said in a statement.\n\n\"Curro reiterates that comments made about the school, the artwork and the learner are not an accurate reflection of our school and the situation referred to, and we reserve the right to withhold comment until the internal investigation has concluded.\"\n\nIt said the group does adopt a Christian ethos, with the values of the Christian faith upheld.\n\n\"Curro accordingly welcomes, values and respects members of staff and learners from different faiths, with their accompanying views.\"\n\nBut while welcoming comment and discussion, it would not \"condone cyber bullying, religious intolerance, hate speech, derogatory language, misrepresentation and comments reflecting negatively on the Curro brand on any social media pages\".\n\nThis is not the first time art has caused a furore in South Africa with a Brett Murray painting of former president Jacob Zuma getting many supporters riled up over The Spear which depicted genitalia.\n\nArtist Ayanda Mabulu has also stared down controversy over his paintings.", "description": "A KwaZulu-Natal matric scholar's final art project showing Jesus as a clown, among other things, has sparked a call for protests by a Christian parent worried about the \"demonic\" influence the work might have.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9501/b50173d8359e4c1187f3a6422c94e0e9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
