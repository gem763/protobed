It's enough,\" said another demonstrator.\n\n'Defend my Lebanon'\n\nThe leaderless protest movement, driven mostly by a young generation of men and women born after the 1975-1990 civil war, has even been described by some as the birth of a Lebanese civic identity.\n\n\"The idea behind this human chain is to show an image of a Lebanon which, from north to south, rejects any sectarian affiliation,\" Julie Tegho Bou Nassif, one of the organisers, told AFP news agency.\n\n\"There is no political demand today, we only want to send a message by simply holding hands under the Lebanese flag,\" the 31-year-old history professor added.\n\nThe army has sought to reopen main roads across the country, where schools and banks have been closed for more than a week.\n\nIn one of the most serious incidents, the army opened fire on Saturday to confront a group of protesters blocking a road in Tripoli, wounding at least six people.\n\nBut the unprecedented protest movement has been relatively incident-free, despite tensions with the armed forces and attempts by party loyalists to stage counter-demonstrations.\n\n\"I'm here to defend my Lebanon from everything,\" one protester told Al Jazeera.\n\nProtesters have been demanding the removal of the entire ruling class. Many of the political heavyweights are former militia leaders seen as representing little beyond their own sectarian or geographical community.\n\nThe protesters see them as corrupt and incompetent and have so far dismissed measures proposed by the political leadership to quell the protests.\n\nThey have accused the political elite of desperately attempting to save their jobs and have stuck to their demands for deep, systemic change.", "description": "Tens of thousands gather to hold hands across the country on the eleventh day of anti-government protests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/27/136e41b7e1a54eab8b462b8f656790b6_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
