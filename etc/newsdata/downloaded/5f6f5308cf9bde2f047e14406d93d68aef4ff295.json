Changing the default options in fast-food restaurants and school lunchrooms could shift the choice architecture, she said, but so could something like Philadelphia\u2019s soda tax, an idea Kelly D. Brownell popularized in The Times back in 1994. Dr. Bleich said:\n\nIt\u2019s one of these policies where not only is it targeting behavior we know is bad for you, but the money is being given back to low-income groups in the form of a free, universal pre-K program. \u2026 That is a great example of a policy win.\n\nGovernment needs to play a more paternalistic role\n\nTinkering at the edges of consumer choices can help, but the state may need to play a larger role, Noah Smith has argued in The Atlantic. He points to Japan, which has managed to achieve the lowest obesity rate in the developed world (4.2 percent in 2016) \u2014 through a naturally healthier diet , in part, but also through government interventions that run counter to American individualism.\n\nIn 2008, for example, Japan passed legislation that mandates yearly waistline measurements and requires those who exceed the maximum to attend diet classes. It also fines employers and municipalities that don\u2019t meet targets.\n\nCultural stigma against being overweight is strong in Japan, but it works in tandem with the government and the food environment to encourage thinness. That pressure may also be driving a rise in eating disorders, according to Toshio Ishikwa, president of the Japan Society for Eating Disorders, especially among women. Nonetheless, Mr. Smith wrote:\n\nGovernment paternalism is in some sense a last resort, but it has worked wonders in the realm of public health in the past. Hand-washing regulations, sewage treatment regulations, cleanliness education and other such paternalistic initiatives brought us out of the cesspool of the Middle Ages into the clean, safe, mostly disease-free paradise in which we now reside.\n\nMedical and cultural attitudes needs to change\n\nThe health care system has ignored evidence-based approaches to wage a cruel, counterproductive war on overweight people, wrote Michael Hobbes in HuffPost. Despite research proving the force with which some people\u2019s bodies fight against long-term weight loss, many doctors, encouraged by the financial and administrative structures of the health care system, take a blanket \u201ctough love\u201d approach that can do more harm than good.\n\nIndeed, research shows that obese people get worse medical care, because, as Gina Kolata wrote in The Times, doctors \u201cdon\u2019t see past the fat.\u201d Ms. Kolata detailed many ways doctors sometimes discriminate against obese people, from dismissing symptoms of life-threatening illnesses to denying a patient surgery.\n\nThe result can be harmful for patients in more ways than one. Sarai Walker, the author of the novel \u201cDietland,\u201d told Ms. Kolata:\n\nI have avoided going to a doctor at all. \u2026 That is very common with fat people. No matter what the problem is, the doctor will blame it on fat and will tell you to lose weight.\n\nAnd others, such as the writer Ijeoma Oluo, take issue with the idea that overweight bodies are a problem to be solved in the first place. \u201cYour body is your business and you deserve the right to exist in it in peace,\u201d she tweeted in a thread:", "description": "Fat shaming makes things worse.
