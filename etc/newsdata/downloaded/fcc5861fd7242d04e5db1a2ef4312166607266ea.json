Today we give thanks to the Lord for our new Saints. They walked by faith and now we invoke their intercession. Three of them were religious women; they show us that the consecrated life is a journey of love at the existential peripheries of the world. Saint Marguerite Bays, on the other hand, was a seamstress; she speaks to us of the power of simple prayer, enduring patience and silent self-giving. That is how the Lord made the splendour of Easter radiate in her life, in her humbleness. Such is the holiness of daily life, which Saint John Henry Newman described in these words: \u201cThe Christian has a deep, silent, hidden peace, which the world sees not\u2026 The Christian is cheerful, easy, kind, gentle, courteous, candid, unassuming; has no pretence\u2026 with so little that is unusual or striking in his bearing, that he may easily be taken at first sight for an ordinary man\u201d (Parochial and Plain Sermons, V, 5). Let us ask to be like that, \u201ckindly lights\u201d amid the encircling gloom. Jesus, \u201cstay with me, and then I shall begin to shine as Thou shinest: so to shine as to be a light to others\u201d (Meditations on Christian Doctrine, VII, 3). Amen.\n\n10.
