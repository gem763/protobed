Read this! by: Julie Donald | 06 Oct 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nOf all the recipes in my arsenal, this is by FAR the most requested. And lucky you, because this is going to change your life. Well maybe just a little bit, you can thank me later!\n\n\n\nALSO READ: 10 Chocolate brownie recipes everyone needs in life\n\nGetting the perfect texture\n\nThe perfect brownie is fudgy in texture. Brownies do not contain enough flour to get fully cooked through like a cake (a knife will never come away clean) and as a result, a common mistake is to overcook the brownie mix resulting in a dry crumbly brownie.\n\nAdded cocoa is a no-no\n\nMany recipes include cocoa powder, but this is a mistake too (in my opinion). If you use a dark chocolate in the preparation of the mixture additional cocoa is unnecessary and can make the brownies powdery and a little bitter.\n\nThe simplicity is the selling point\n\nThe best thing about brownies is that even my five-year-old can make them (well sort of\u2026 if you don\u2019t mind a fair bit of double dipping). The basic mixture is as simple as melting the things that need to be melted and mixing it all together. And voila!\n\nThe chocolate\n\nThis recipe is heavy on the chocolate which can make it a bit pricey. You can use any chocolate that takes your fancy; I usually use a better quality baking chocolate, much less expensive than supermarket chocolate and once melted with the butter it is just as delicious!\n\nGluten free\n\nBecause the recipe is low in flour it lends itself to a gluten free version. Simply replace the self-raising flour with gluten free self-raising flour and Bob\u2019s your uncle!\n\nVariations\n\nI mostly make the straight and narrow version (pecan nuts and dark chocolate chips), but you can add pretty much anything that you like. Some of my more inspired additions are white chocolate chips, speckled eggs, mini marshmallows, cornflakes, crushed cookies and jelly beans. Actually, not sure about the jelly beans being inspired, come to think of it.\n\nNuts\n\nYou can also go nuts with nuts. Pecans are the standard, but hazelnuts are lovely (toast them beforehand and rub off the skins in a tea towel), as is pistachio and white chocolate chip, flaked almonds give it a bit of crunch and walnuts have a good amount of bitterness to offset the sweet chocolate.\n\nCooking time and temperature\n\nThey cook at a low temperature and for quite a while. Set your oven to 150\u00b0C and bake until the top doesn\u2019t wobble when you shake the tin. Remember to place a tray below, as they occasionally bubble over the sides of your baking tray.\n\nCooling and cutting\n\nTo get perfect squares, leave them to cool completely before you cut them. By which, I mean, leave them overnight\u2026 if you can hold off that long.\n\nStoring\n\nBrownies keep extremely well, about 2 weeks in an air tight container or 3 months if frozen.\n\n\n\nTry these fool-proof chocolate brownies:\n\n\n\nIngredients:\n\n250g butter\n\n350g dark chocolate\n\n10ml vanilla essence\n\n10ml coffee powder\n\n3 eggs\n\n225g castor sugar\n\n75g self-raising flour\n\n150g chocolate chips\n\n175g pecan nuts\n\n\n\nPreparation:\n\nButter and flour a 23cm square cake tin. Preheat the oven to 150\u00b0C. In a microwavable bowl mix the butter, chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Heat this in the microwave until melted. Set aside to cool slightly.\n\n\n\nIn a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and castor sugar together. Fold in the self-raising flour. To this mixture add the melted chocolate and butter, and mix well. Then fold in the chocolate chips and pecan nuts. Pour all this into the baking tin and bang a few times on the counter top to dislodge any large air bubbles. Bake in a slow oven for about 40 minutes.\n\n\n\nThe mixture should have a defined crust on top and should not be wobbly, but it will still be slightly soft to the touch and a skewer will NOT come out clean. Remove from the oven and leave until completely cold (preferably overnight) before cutting. Cut into squares and store in an airtight container. The brownies can be stored for about two weeks in an airtight container or about a month if frozen.\n\n\n\nALSO READ: How to make the perfect fudge\n\n\n\nRead more on: brownies | chocolate | recipes | baking", "description": "Can't get brownies with the perfect chewy texture?
