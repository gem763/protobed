We would like to confirm that this cosplay will not be appearing in the event, and we would like to apologise for any offence caused.\n\n'We are currently reviewing all of terms and conditions to make sure that they are clearer to avoid any confusion in the future.'\n\nThe decision sparked furious debate online, with many praising the event co-coordinators for 'fighting racism' - while others criticised them for the 'absolutely ridiculous' decision.\n\nOne Twitter user said: 'Thank you for listening and taking action, even better to prevent any future offence as people need to learn that this really isn't ok.'\n\n'I am not saying blackface doesn't exist.

Good on you @EuroCosplay for doing the right thing.'\n\nOne person responded: 'Are you high? How is this offensive? We are commenting it isn't, because it isn't... it's a faithful (and amazing) reproduction of a game character which in no way demeans anybody.'\n\nAnother said: 'Dude I'm black and this is 100% not blackfacing lmao thank you for getting offended for my skin color smh.'\n\nTwitter user @ToussaintDewey posted a meme showing a drooling gormless cartoon figure whose head is being used as a birdbath, with the caption: 'Meanwhile in Eurocosplay HQ.'\n\nMs Livanart said people have been very supportive, writing messages that helped her when she was feeling down and crying because she did not understand what was happening\n\nCommenting on the picture of Ms Livanart's mask, Instagram user minomotu said: 'Ahhh yes it\u2019s ok to pretend to be a poc cause it\u2019s just a mask.
