She denied speculation at the time that she was suing or extorting the comedian, announcing she wanted to join forces with him against the person who illegally recorded them.\n\n\"My pictures and my name have been released with lies written about me,\" Sabbag told reporters in 2017. \"I am not an extortionist. I am not a stripper. I am a recording artist and an actress and I have not broken any laws.\"\n\nIn a new lawsuit filed Sept. 16, 2019, she accuses Jonathan Todd Jackson of secretly recording her \"without her knowledge or consent, while she was engaged in private, consensual sexual relations with Hart,\" according to the documents. Sabbag also is suing Hart, as well as hotel operators Marriott, Blackstone and the Cosmopolitan, for \"negligently or intentionally\" allowing Jackson access to his hotel room.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Hart's representatives and Sabbag's lawyer for comment.\n\nMontia Sabbag (right) and then-lawyer Lisa Bloom (left) speak to reporters in 2017 after Sabbag was accused of attempting to extort Kevin Hart.

More\n\nHart publicly apologized at the time to his wife Eniko and children Heaven, now 14, and Hendrix, now 11. The couple has since welcomed Kenzo, 1.\n\n\"I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m not going to sit up here and say that I am, or claim to be in any way shape or form,\" he said. \"And I made a bad error in judgment and I put myself in a bad environment where only bad things can happen, and they did. And in doing that I know that I\u2019m going to hurt the people closest to me, who I talked to and apologized to, that would be my wife and my kids.\"\n\nHart is currently recovering from a major back injury after his vintage muscle car crashed in Malibu earlier this month. Eniko Hart told TMZ outside the hospital shortly after the accident that he was \"going to be just fine.\"\n\nContributing: Andrea Mandell, USA TODAY.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Kevin Hart faces $60 million lawsuit in 2017 Las Vegas hotel recording", "description": "Kevin Hart was named in a $60 million lawsuit by Montia Sabbag from a 2017 incident in which she and Hart were filmed in a Las Vegas hotel room.", "authors": ["Hannah Yasharoff", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eNxkwsZyQCJPK_.LV_ykMg--~B/aD0yMDEyO3c9MjgwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_entertainment_893/a384205dfdb51c0cbafedeb613a59eea", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
