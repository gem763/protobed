But it should really be at the top because store closures are no longer doing the trick to shore up the retail space\u2019s profitability as in years\u2019 past. Instead, the argument could be made store closures are only pushing more people to shopping on desktop computers, tablets and mobile phones \u2014which is usually a less profitable transaction for retailers due to free shipping costs and investments in building out digital capabilities.\n\nPrinted paper sign on door of Toys R Us store in Dublin, California following the company's bankruptcy, with yellow caution tape and text reading \"Thank you for shopping with us all these years, we hope to make a triumphant return in the future, and thank you for never growing up, because if you did you'd never be a Toys R Us kid\", July 23, 2018.

CoreSight Research, which is cited by Terry, projects the retail store closure number to reach 12,000 by year end.\n\nOnline is obviously still the big winner here.\n\n\u201cWe believe eCommerce growth will likely accelerate over the course of the second half as a record number of retail store closures, initiatives around fulfillment such as Amazon\u2019s $800 million investment in same day delivery and Etsy\u2019s move to free shipping, and easing comps, drive more consumers to shift purchases online,\u201d Terry writes.\n\nSpecific names Terry believes will be market share gainers include Amazon (AMZN), Etsy (ETSY) and Stitch Fix (SFIX).\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
