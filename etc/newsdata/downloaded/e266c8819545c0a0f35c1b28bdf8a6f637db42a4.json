He placed the 1968 assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in the 1970s.\n\n\u201cYou assured us, \u2018I\u2019m not going nuts,\u2019 \u201d Colbert continued. \u201cFollow up question: Are you going nuts?\u201d\n\nBiden paused a beat and responded, \u201cThe reason I came on the Jimmy Kimmel show is \u2026\u201d\n\nColbert asked whether it was unfair to criticize Biden for his gaffes.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to go after a political figure for anything. Okay? I mean we\u2019re \u2014 we stand up and that comes with the territory,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut here\u2019s the deal. Any gaffe that I have made \u2014 and I\u2019ve made gaffes just like any politician I know has \u2014 have been not about a substantive issue.\u201d\n\nBiden then referred to his story about a soldier, which \u2014 as The Washington Post reported last week \u2014 never happened and appeared to be a conflation of facts from at least three actual events.\n\nThe Post article detailed Biden\u2019s account, which he recently relayed to a crowd in New Hampshire: In it, he says that as vice president, he made a risky flight into Afghanistan\u2019s dangerous Konar province to pin a Silver Star on a Navy captain who had rappelled down a 60-foot ravine to retrieve the body of an American comrade and carry him up on his back.\n\nNone of those facts was true. Some of Biden\u2019s story seemed to stem from a 2011 ceremony in which he pinned a Bronze Star on an Army staff sergeant who received the award for trying to pull a fellow soldier\u2019s body from a burning vehicle in a different province in Afghanistan.\n\nShortly after The Post article was published, Biden cast doubt on its accuracy: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the problem is. What is it that I said wrong?\u201d he asked in an interview with Post columnist Jonathan Capehart.\n\n\u201cThey said that the branch of the military was wrong,\u201d Colbert told Biden. \u201cAnd that the date was wrong. And the act it was awarded for was wrong. And the medal was wrong.\u201d\n\nThe crowd began to chuckle.\n\n\u201cI was not talking about me, I was praising \u2026 the valor of all these people out there that I visited in over 20 visits in Afghanistan and Iraq,\u201d Biden responded. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve watched these people, and I\u2019ve watched what they\u2019ve done. And I was pointing out the young man who I did pin the medal on in Wardak province \u2014 he didn\u2019t want the medal because his buddy had been killed as he was being dragged out of a burning Humvee. He said, \u2018Don\u2019t pin it on me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBiden said that despite the errors, he got the essence of the story correct.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s a different thing to say when you\u2019re talking about honoring the bravery or the sacrifice or what other people went through,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd the essence of it is absolutely true.\u201d\n\nBiden appeared to still get some details wrong on Wednesday. He said that he pinned a medal on an unwilling soldier twice, once as vice president-elect and once as a senator. The Post was able to locate only one soldier, who received a medal from Biden in 2011, when Biden was vice president.\n\nHe went on a trip to Afghanistan as a senator, but in the days after his return, he recounted watching then as a two-star general pinned a medal on a soldier. He also went as vice president-elect on a trip to Kabul to meet with Hamid Karzai, then the president of Afghanistan. That trip did not include a visit to a forward operating base, as Biden described.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I said that I was vice president \u2014 well, in one case I was vice president-elect. The other case, I was a senator,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s relevant but I don\u2019t, you know, I don\u2019t get wrong things like you know there is \u2014 we should lock kids up in cages at the border.\u201d\n\nWhen Colbert pressed Biden on a recent comment he made to NPR, saying that \u201cdetails are irrelevant,\u201d Biden responded, \u201cThose details are irrelevant. The point I was making is absolutely accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut some details are relevant \u2014 that\u2019s where the devil is, is in the details,\u201d Colbert said.\n\n\u201cThe devil lives in the details if the details that you\u2019re talking about would affect the outcome of something that\u2019s about to happen, or should happen,\u201d Biden answered. \u201cAnd the idea that, you know, I made the case that these folks are heroes and we shouldn\u2019t treat them as that, and we should be thankful to them.\u201d\n\nWhen the conversation turned to another topic, Biden said that he talks regularly with former president Barack Obama and that their last conversation was about three or four weeks ago. When asked whether he would nominate Obama to the Supreme Court were he to become president, Biden said, \u201cHe\u2019s fully qualified. Fully qualified.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he had approached former first lady Michelle Obama for advice, Biden quipped, \u201cOnly to be my vice president.\u201d\n\nAt the start of his appearance on the show, when asked what was new, Biden quipped, \u201cNothing much. There\u2019s no global warming, so don\u2019t worry about that. Everything\u2019s going well. The nation is in great shape. And the rest of the world is looking at us with envy.\u201d\n\nToward the end, Biden was asked about electability, which has become a central component of his campaign pitch.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ve been around a long time,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe good and the bad news is all these people think they know me. They know a lot about me. They know the things that are real about me. They know that things aren\u2019t real. And so it\u2019s a lot harder for people to go out and make a case that I\u2019m this or that when people know me. I\u2019ve been around for all these years. A lot of me they don\u2019t like, some of it they do like.\u201d\n\nBiden had appeared on Colbert\u2019s show in September 2015, and Colbert encouraged him at the time to run for president. But in a raw and emotional moment during that visit, Biden said that he still felt conflicted and broken after the death of his son, Beau.\n\nAs he does at times on the campaign trail, Biden had in 2015 connected with Colbert over shared experiences of grief. Biden\u2019s first wife and daughter died in a car accident decades before his son\u2019s death, and Colbert\u2019s father and two of his brothers died in a plane crash when he was a young boy.\n\n\u201cYou and I talked about this \u2026 when my son was going through some tough times, after he passed,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cYou said I should run. And so that\u2019s why I\u2019m running. It\u2019s your fault.\u201d", "description": "The former vice president made his first stop on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d since launching his presidential campaign and again defended a false story he told about a military hero.", "authors": ["Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/E0DQCEUDkisJU0qAXWs0UGZcnLg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y3EF5KWPOAI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
