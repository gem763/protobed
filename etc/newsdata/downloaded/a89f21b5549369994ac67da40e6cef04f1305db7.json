I don't say yes or no,\" he said. \"I don't say we are going to sign or not sign, sell or not sell.\n\n\"It is not the moment to talk, when the time arrives we are going to take that decision in one way or another.\n\n\"Now is the time to stay all together, all of the squad, with the staff and the fans and try and change the atmosphere.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"We are not going to get any benefit to talk about January, it is too far away, we have got a lot of games to play.\n\n\"That is the structure of the club that is working and thinking and they need to be ready if we need to do something, if not we keep going, but I am happy with the squad, I am happy with the players.\n\n\"Like always, what is going to happen in January I cannot guess today, what happens will happen.\"", "description": "It was announced on Friday that Spurs will be the subject of the latest Amazon series of All or Nothing", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Tottenham Hotspur Fc Via Getty I", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20659188.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tottenham-Hotspur-v-Watford-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
