If people like (the fight), I can do.\u201d\n\nSanchez, who won Season 1 of \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter\u201d reality series and has been part of the UFC roster since 2005, watched Maia\u2019s win over Askren with a keen eye and was listening with a close ear.\n\nWithin minutes of Maia mentioning his name after his win at Singapore Indoor Stadium in Singapore, Sanchez took to social media and enthusiastically responded (via Instagram):\n\nLet\u2019s go @danawhite I didn\u2019t get the go on the @showtimepettis fight I have paid my dues, only you know the truth of my last outing. Let\u2019s put it together Jan 18th in Vegas!!! two legends want to dance let us dance! @ufc\n\nSanchez is coming off a unanimous-decision loss to Michael Chiesa at UFC 239 in July. He\u2019d won two straight fights prior to that contest, and after each of those mentioned Maia as someone he\u2019d like to fight.\n\nMeanwhile, Maia moved in to second place all-time on the UFC wins list with his effort at UFC on ESPN+ 20. He also has the second most submissions in company history, and he would certainly try to add another against Sanchez, who has never been tapped out in 41 professional contests.", "description": "Diego Sanchez is all in on a fight against Demian Maia after the Brazilian called him out at UFC on ESPN+ 20.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/michael-chiesa-diego-sanchez-ufc-239-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
