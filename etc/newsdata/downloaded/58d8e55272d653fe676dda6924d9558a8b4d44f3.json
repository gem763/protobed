When you try again, you\u2019ll fall off. It was a wildly improbable thing to have done in the first place. That voice was there. She said her thing. There\u2019s nothing you can really add in her voice.\u201d\n\nBut a few years ago, Atwood started plotting a way to continue her 1985 dystopian classic about the women of Gilead, a religious autocracy in what was formerly the United States, where fertile women are subjected to ritualised rape and forced to bear children for the upper class citizens.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBetween then and now, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale became a pop culture phenomenon, a political rallying cry and a hit television series on Hulu, starring Elisabeth Moss as Offred, the narrator. The English-language edition of the novel has sold more than 8m copies worldwide. Women dressed as handmaids have flooded Congress and state capitols to protest new restrictions on reproductive rights. Expectations for Atwood\u2019s sequel, which this month was named to the Booker Prize shortlist ahead of its release on Tuesday, are stratospheric.\n\nAdding to those pressures is that a Handmaid\u2019s Tale sequel effectively exists already. The TV adaptation, created by Bruce Miller, has extended Offred\u2019s saga beyond the scope of the novel. So Atwood and Miller had to calibrate plot and character developments in the show, so that the series didn\u2019t contradict her sequel, or vice versa.\n\n\u201cMargaret offered me more restrictions, and I gave her more information,\u201d Miller said in an interview. \u201cI had to be careful about where I was going and what I was doing. She controls the world.\u201d\n\nThe sequel, titled The Testaments, takes place roughly 15 years after the end of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, when Offred is led into a black van. The sequel features two new narrators \u2013 a young woman who has been brought up in Gilead and a Canadian teenager who escaped the regime as an infant \u2013 and a third who will be familiar to fans of the original novel and show: Aunt Lydia, the terrifying, vindictive architect of Gilead\u2019s system for training women for reproductive servitude. As their intertwined stories unfold, Atwood reveals new facets of how Gilead\u2019s power structure came to be, and how it eventually crumbles.

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nWhen you announced the sequel, you said that you were aiming to answer questions that readers had been asking about Gilead for years. What were some of those questions?\n\nThey all begin with \u201cwhat if.\u201d And one of the what ifs was this: Totalitarian systems don\u2019t last, it is my fervent belief. Some of them have lasted longer than others. When they come apart, what is it that causes them to fall apart? Well, there\u2019s a lot of different scenarios. Crumbling from within, corruption and inter-purging among the elites; attacks from without; generational succession. The first generation generally comes with righteous fervour, the second is focused on administration; and the third generation starts to think, What are we doing?\n\nAfter the election of President Trump, sales of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale surged and readers noted how timely it felt. Some elements have become even more aligned with current events, with the erosion of reproductive rights, separation of parents from their children at the border and the targeting of minorities by white supremacists. Did you want to write a sequel in part to address some of those new parallels?\n\nNo, no. It\u2019s always bubbling away in any country. White supremacists are there and then they come out when conditions are favourable, as they are in the United States right now.\n\nThe Testaments picks up 15 years later, but it weaves in plot elements that were introduced in the TV show. Were you consciously trying to build off it?\n\nI was trying to make it so that there weren\u2019t any glaring inconsistencies. They updated the timeline, so we leave a lot of things open.\n\nIn the show\u2019s second season, Offred\u2019s baby, Nichole, is smuggled out of the country to Canada. Baby Nichole is central to the plot of your new novel. Did you get the idea for that character from the show and decide to expand on her in the sequel?\n\nNo, Nichole was my name. You\u2019ll notice that I\u2019ve left them a lot of blank wall paper to draw on behind the scenes, so it\u2019s up to them how they get people across the border in their part of the plot.\n\nYou\u2019ve been very involved in the show, which continues Offred\u2019s story beyond the scope of your first novel. What has that process been like?\n\nI have influence but no power. There\u2019s a big difference. I\u2019m not the person who can ultimately sign off on anything. So, I\u2019m in communication with Bruce, and I say things like, You can\u2019t kill that person.\n\nDoes that work?\n\nWell, he didn\u2019t kill her. But he wasn\u2019t going to kill her anyway. She\u2019s too good to kill.\n\nWhich character?\n\nAunt Lydia.\n\nHave there been times where the showrunners wanted to take the plot and characters in a direction that you felt violated the rules of the world you built?\n\nThere\u2019s a couple of things that are in the book that they didn\u2019t entirely pick up, but you can see why they didn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s a television show.\n\nIn the book they go full white supremacy. I give them an out for the show. They make the cast multiracial in the TV series for a few reasons: Number one, they updated it to now, and number two, Hulu has a diversity clause, and number three, a show in which everybody was white would be very boring to look at.\n\nHave there been plot developments that you\u2019ve disagreed with?\n\nI\u2019ve done some yelling, but it was fairly effective yelling. I think it\u2019s a bit of a problem for people that know about real totalitarianism that some of these characters have survived for as long as they did. Surely they would have been shot by now. Quite a few too many people know what June has been up to.\n\nIn The Testaments, Aunt Lydia becomes much more complex and sympathetic, a victim as well as a perpetrator. How did she evolve in your mind over the decades and why did you decide to make her a central character in the sequel?\n\nHow do you get to be a high-ranking person within a totalitarian dictatorship? Either you\u2019re a true believer from the beginning, at which point you\u2019re probably going to get purged later on, or you\u2019re an opportunist. Or it can be fear, or it can be a combination of all of them. I would put fear as number one: If I don\u2019t do this, I will be killed.\n\nAunt Lydia\u2019s always been a climber, so she climbed up. She\u2019s not easily disturbed, but she\u2019s not a true believer like some of the others. As J Edgar Hoover did, she realises the power of having dirt on people that you don\u2019t reveal publicly.\n\nWhen did you first have the idea to write the sequel, and was it something that you had considered before but never gotten around to?\n\nI\u2019ve always been thinking about it. I went back in my notes recently and found out that I was thinking about a Handmaid\u2019s Tale sequel back in 1991. So then you just jump in and see what happens.\n\nI wondered if the success of the television show factored into your decision to write a sequel, and how it shaped your understanding of the world and the characters. Were you aiming to reassert creative control over the world that you created?\n\nI can see why you might think that, but no, not really. It really is what I told you at first: how do totalitarianisms fall apart.\n\nWith a work that\u2019s as beloved as The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, you face enormous pressure to produce a satisfying sequel. Were you nervous about meeting fans\u2019s expectations?\n\nWill this ruin my future, my literary reputation? If I were 35, you would be absolutely right to ask that question. But it\u2019s not a chief concern of mine.\n\nDid you reread The Handmaid\u2019s Tale before you wrote The Testaments? What struck you about it?\n\nOf course. I also went back through my clippings file, because in those days, there was no internet, so we clipped things out of newspapers. And all of the things that are now such topics of conversation and such topics of agony, they were all being talked about then. The rise of white supremacy, that layer has never gone away, it\u2019s always been there, but somebody opened a door. Religious cults subordinating women was being talked about. Baby stealing is an age-old human motif. Forcing women to have babies, it happens in the Trojan War, for heaven\u2019s sake.\n\nWhat recent events shaped your thinking?\n\nI don\u2019t want to be too specific, because you\u2019re just dictating to the reader, and I would rather let them do their own thinking. That\u2019s why when people say, what happened to Offred, I say, your choice. History is full of people who disappear and you can\u2019t find any trace of them. What ending would you like to have?\n\nThe sequel is not as ambiguous and open-ended as the original. Was that deliberate on your part, to give the story a feeling of finality?\n\nOh, I don\u2019t know. This one has more closure. Someone said, oh, it\u2019s such a happy ending, well, not for everyone in the story. It is a more positive ending than one might have expected at certain points of the story. I\u2019m a World War II baby. Things looked pretty dark in 1942.\n\nHow do you feel about the fact that your book has taken on new political resonance and that you\u2019re sometimes held up as a figurehead of the resistance?\n\nI have no control over it. I think using the handmaids\u2019s costume as a protest mechanism is brilliant. You can\u2019t be thrown out, you\u2019re not making a disturbance, and you\u2019re not saying anything, but you\u2019re very visible and everybody knows what you mean. So it has been a brilliant tactic.\n\nIs it also kind of depressing that people are seeing echoes of your fictional dystopia in contemporary politics?\n\nFrom a political point of view, the desired outcome of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale would have been that it would fade into obscurity as a period piece, so that my dire warnings would not prove to be correct. That\u2019s not the turn that history has taken.\n\nBoth Offred in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Aunt Lydia in The Testaments wonder if anyone will ever read the words they set down, if their stories will matter. I wondered if that reflected your own views on writing and your desire to connect with readers, and your fear that maybe your work won\u2019t have an impact.\n\nThat\u2019s true of every writer. Every writer. Even as you write, I see you writing away there, what if your editor kills your piece? Then you will never have a reader. Every time when you set implement to surface, I won\u2019t even say pen to paper, because it could be a stone, it could be a tree, you\u2019re implying a reader, and it\u2019s always a future reader, unless the person\u2019s standing looking over your shoulder. The writer is always in that position because you\u2019re always separated in time and place from whoever\u2019s reading your book. It\u2019s always a leap into the unknown future to write anything.\n\nIn the past, you\u2019ve rejected the feminist label, yet so many readers and critics see feminist ideas in your work. I wonder how you feel about being held up as a feminist icon.\n\nI\u2019m uncomfortable with the label if the other person won\u2019t define it. You have to ask, what kind of feminism are you talking about? Like if someone asks you, are you a Christian, what kind of Christian? Are you someone who dances with snakes, do I think the Pope is infallible, what are we talking about here? Where are we on the spectrum, because there\u2019s a lot of varieties. Similarly with feminists, who are frequently denouncing one another. So what kind am I? Because I\u2019m interested in fairness, I\u2019m of an egalitarian kind, in which equal means equal, it doesn\u2019t mean superior. So you don\u2019t get extra points.\n\nYou don\u2019t mind your work being labelled dystopian, though.\n\nI know what that means. It\u2019s a society which we find less preferable than the one we\u2019re living in, and utopian is one in which we assume that things will be better than the one we\u2019re living in. But as I point out, some people\u2019s dystopia is other people\u2019s utopia, and vice versa.\n\nWhat scares you the most right now?\n\nI\u2019m too old to be scared by much. You\u2019re scared when you\u2019re young you don\u2019t know the plot. You haven\u2019t achieved much when you\u2019re 20, so you\u2019re scared about your future, of course you are. You\u2019re hopeful, you\u2019re excited, but you\u2019re also scared. So what I\u2019m hopeful about, rather than scared, are the young people. They are changing the political discourse.\n\nHave you thought about writing another book about Gilead, making it a trilogy?\n\nNo. I\u2019m too old\n\nAre you working on another novel?\n\nIt\u2019s just a question of the timeline, how much is left? At my age, let\u2019s say it takes me four years to write a novel. Who knows? These are theoretical questions. How many milestone birthdays can you have?\n\nIt sounds like you don\u2019t feel a lot of pressure to write more, like you\u2019ve got nothing left to prove.\n\nIt\u2019s just that there isn\u2019t a lot of time left. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re going so wild over the promotion of this book. I know what they\u2019re thinking. They\u2019re thinking, What if she dies? Ooh, we better do it now. Go all out. Last chance. I say that and they just sort of blush and shuffle their feet. They can\u2019t deny they\u2019re thinking of it. [laughs]\n\nWhat are you working on now?\n\nI\u2019m working on my collection of poems. It\u2019s short\n\nThis article was originally published in The New York Times", "description": "Margaret Atwood wasn\u2019t sure she had a Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u00a0sequel in her, even as fans clamoured for one.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/06/10/margaret-atwood.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
