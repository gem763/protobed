Then the [BGB] patrol team fired back in self defence,\" the BGB said.\n\nThe Indian border force named the shot officer as Head Constable Vijay Bhan Singh. The second guard was taken to hospital, where he was fighting for his life.\n\nIllegal fishing\n\nBangladesh said officials from both sides met after the incident and agreed to investigate the encounter and hold future talks.\n\nOn Friday, the situation at the border was \"normal\", Shariful Islam a spokesman for the Bangladeshi force said.\n\n\"Our troops have been put on high alert to avoid any untoward incident,\" he told Reuters news agency.\n\nIllegal fishing is not uncommon in the Sunderbans, a UNESCO world heritage site which straddles the border of India and Bangladesh and is famous for its mangrove forest.\n\nThousands of people fish in the area around the year. Fishermen detained on both sides are usually released after talks between border officials.\n\nBorder relations between India and Bangladesh have been calm, and this is the first fatal incident in recent times.\n\nThe neighbours struck a series of deals this month when Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visited New Delhi.\n\nThey share a border stretching more than 4,000 km (2,400 miles), where clashes have intermittently erupted over what India terms illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.", "description": "Bangladesh border forces fire 'in self-defence' after Indian guards attempted to secure release of detained fisherman.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/e8b673e902794dc69fbb170753ca7b86_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
