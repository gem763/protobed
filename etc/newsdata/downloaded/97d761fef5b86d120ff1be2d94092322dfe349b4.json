Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is the most aggressive Democratic presidential candidate on antitrust. In March 2019, she laid out a plan for breaking up Amazon, Google, and Facebook. No need for bothersome due process, fact gathering, and expert analysis.\n\nFortunately, some candidates believe it\u2019s a good idea to think long and hard before potentially destroying companies that billions of people enjoy using every day. Former Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang were skeptical that breaking up the companies would resolve issues raised by tech critics.\n\nThere are at least 3 reasons these candidates are right to not make antitrust judgments during a presidential race.\n\nReason 1: Good antitrust needs facts, analyses, and rule of law\n\nAntitrust is complex, and professionals in the field study cases for months and sometimes years before there are final decisions. And even then, things can go wrong: After years of investigation and litigation, the government dropped its 1969 case against IBM, concluding that the case had no merit. Much of the government\u2019s 2000 case against Microsoft also failed.\n\nWhat analyses are done? One determines whether a firm has market power, which is a lot more complicated than simply calling them \u201chuge monopolies\u201d as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) does. Current best practice is to study whether companies can increase prices without losing many customers.\n\nAnother analysis determines whether market power is used to harm consumers. This, too, is complicated, as evidenced by the government losing the AT&T and Time Warner merger case despite hiring one of the world\u2019s best antitrust economists.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "More than antitrust.", "authors": ["Mark Jamison"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jXR5AgYc5Fx5E6VxpEFmfA--~B/aD05Nzg7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/a7a81995e61abefe477e59ba6468cac9", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
