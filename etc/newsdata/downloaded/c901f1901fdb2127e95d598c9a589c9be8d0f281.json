Those additions are said to up the overall price as well, somewhere above the current price of $160.\n\nThough Apple has yet to confirm the next-generation AirPods, an image uncovered in a beta version of the iPhone operating system depicts headphones that appear to be the unannounced headphones.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nApple is reportedly planning to unveil the first major update to the AirPods, with enhanced features such as water resistance and noise cancellation.\n\nRumors point to a 2020 launch window and a higher price tag for the next-generation AirPods. But what will they look like?\n\nThat's the big question, and a newly unearthed Apple image from the iOS beta may have just offered us a first look:\n\nThe image was discovered by MacRumors, and it lines up suspiciously well with an early photo leak of the next-generation AirPods. In that leak, a pair of what are said to be redesigned Apple AirPods appear \u2014 distinctly different from the existing AirPods in a few crucial ways. For one, the stems are shorter. Even more importantly, though, both Apple's image and the photo from months ago depict headphones that use little rubberized tips to seal against your ear.\n\nThe AirPods revamp comes as Apple faces increasing competition in the wireless-earbuds market that it has until now largely had to itself. Last month, Amazon unveiled its $130 Echo Buds, and on Wednesday, Microsoft announced the Surface Earbuds, which will cost $249.\n\nApple representatives didn't respond to a request for comment as of publishing.\n\nRead more: Apple is expected to launch 3 new iPhones this year \u2014 here's everything we know so far\n\nTechnically speaking, Apple already updated its AirPods this year.\n\nApple\n\nThe second-generation AirPods, pictured above, added \"Hey, Siri\" functionality and a longer battery life. Apple also introduced a wireless-charging case as an option for an extra $40.\n\nThis more iterative approach, which kept the look and $160 price of the original AirPods, isn't being abandoned with the third-generation AirPods, 9to5Mac reported.\n\nAccording to Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with TF International Securities, a more subtle update to AirPods will also arrive along with the upgraded pair. These AirPods will retain a lower asking price but are unlikely to feature water resistance and noise cancellation. They are expected to arrive in the first quarter of 2020 along with the more heavily updated AirPods.\n\nApple has yet to acknowledge the rumors or announce new AirPods officially.", "description": "An image that Apple published in a beta version of iOS 13 appears to depict a new version of Apple's AirPods with a totally new design.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d95025471cffc1190632c75?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
