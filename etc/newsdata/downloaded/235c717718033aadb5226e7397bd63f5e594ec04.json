After welcoming their first daughter, Ella, Nick proposed to Charlotte on a break in Carden Park in 2012, popping the question while walking by a huge lake with water fountains.\n\nThe couple, from Stoke-on-Trent, weren\u2019t in much of a rush to get married.\n\nBut then, in 2017, Charlotte\u2019s dad was told his prostate cancer had spread to his lymph nodes and bones.
