But it\u2019s good enough where I can run, cut and do all that type of stuff.\u201d\n\nMahomes will need full mobility to evade the Texans defenders, led by defensive end J.J. Watt, who have made 15 quarterback sacks this season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to put him in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we roll here. If we thought it was going to hurt him down the road, he wouldn\u2019t be in there.\u201d\n\nMahomes, last year\u2019s NFL Most Valuable Player, has completed 65.6 percent of his passes for an NFL-best 1,831 yards and 11 touchdowns with no interceptions as well as rushing for 81 yards.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a phenomenal player,\u201d Watt said of Mahomes. \u201cIt\u2019s a great challenge for us, which we\u2019re really looking forward to. But the guy deserves all the credit he gets. He\u2019s a great player.\u201d\n\nWatson, who like Mahomes entered the NFL in 2017, has completed 69.2 percent of his passes for 1,364 yards and 11 touchdowns with only one interception while rushing for 122 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nBut the Texans\u2019 offensive fireworks finally exploded last week as Watson, who has been sacked 18 times this season, threw for 426 yards and five touchdowns with no interceptions or sacks and only five incompletions.\n\nHe was the first passer in NFL history with more than 400 yards and five touchdowns with five or fewer incompletions in the same game as Houston\u2019s attack rolled up 592 yards.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Deshaun,\u201d said Texans receiver DeAndre Hopkins. \u201cThe things he can do with the football in his hands, not a lot of quarterbacks can do that. Stay in the pocket and take hits, make throws on the run, make the right calls, put the offense in \u2014 I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018He\u2019s a magician\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe Texans rank second in the NFL in scoring when they reach an opponent\u2019s 20-yard line.\n\nIt helps that Houston\u2019s offensive line has improved, with left tackle Laremy Tunsil, who only arrived last month in a trade from Miami, anchoring Watson\u2019s protectors and watching as the signal caller ran 10 yards after recovering his own fumble.\n\n\u201cI was right there and I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way he picked it up and ran for a first down,\u2019\u201d Tunsil said. \u201cHe\u2019s a magician, bro. A magician.\u201d\n\nNFC East co-leader Philadelphia (3-2) visits Minnesota (3-2) while co-leader Dallas travels to New York to face the winless Jets (0-4).\n\nUndefeated San Francisco (4-0) will visit the Los Angeles Rams (3-2) while Seattle, also in the hunt for the lead with those NFC West rivals, takes a 4-1 mark to Cleveland (2-3).\n\nNFC South leader New Orleans (4-1) travels to Jacksonville (2-3) while NFC North leader Green Bay (4-1) hosts Detroit on Monday night.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 NFL passing pace-setter Patrick Mahomes, nursing a sore left ankle, leads the Kansas City Chiefs against visiting Houston on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/11a550_kansas-city-quarterback-patrick-mahomes-leads-chiefs-showdown-nfl-division-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
