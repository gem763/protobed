REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein\n\n\u201cWhether or not the president submits a formal proposal, he has been having good-faith negotiations and conversations with a number of senators from both parties,\u201d Representative Steve Scalise told reporters after a meeting at the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure ... ultimately if they\u2019re going to get an agreement, but they are having some good-faith negotiations.\u201d\n\nScalise, a gun violence victim himself, was one of four Senate and House Republican leaders who met with Trump, Attorney General William Barr and other White House officials at the afternoon meeting.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Scalise rejected a Democratic bill passed by the House last February to tighten gun sale background checks. \u201cWe\u2019re not going there,\u201d he said when asked by a reporter what legislation Trump might support.\n\nDemocrats have been pressuring Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring that bill up for a vote in the Senate, which he has so far refused, citing White House opposition.\n\nIt was not clear from Scalise\u2019s remarks whether the White House is now focused on developing some sort of gun control legislation or instead taking administrative actions to tighten enforcement.\n\n\u201cMaking the current system work better while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. That\u2019s where the focus needs to be,\u201d Scalise said. He accused Democrats of trying to make it harder for such citizens to buy guns.\n\nTwo years ago, Scalise was seriously wounded by a gunman in a Washington, D.C. suburb while he was at a practice for a congressional baseball game.\n\nThe push for new gun control legislation follows a spate of mass murders by gunmen in Texas and Ohio last month.", "description": "The second-ranking Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Tuesday he was not sure whether President Donald Trump would be able to come to any agreement with lawmakers on new gun control legislation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428489853&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8928E", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
