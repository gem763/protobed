It\u2019s being republished today for the 25th anniversary of Friends.

After all, today\u2019s students are a digital generation who have only a vague association with the concept of \u201cTV.\u201d Sure enough, when Greenwald mentioned his job to them, one student in the group asked, \u201cSo what does that mean? Do you, like, watch Netflix?\u201d Greenwald said, sure, he watches Netflix, since watching original streaming programming \u2014 on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, wherever \u2014 is all part of covering the complex new television landscape. Then he asked the teenagers if they watch Netflix. They said, enthusiastically, Yes. So he asked them what they like to watch on Netflix. They said, \u00adenthusiastically, Friends.\n\nYou remember Friends, right? Chandler, Monica, Joey, Phoebe, Rachel, Ross, and, fleetingly, that monkey? Central Perk? \u201cWe were on a break\u201d? The show that feels, in its way, as iconic a relic of the 1990s as do Nirvana, Pulp Fiction, and a two-term Clinton presidency that the Onion later cheekily described as \u201cour long national nightmare of peace and prosperity\u201d?\n\nFriends was not only born of that era but may, in hindsight, embody it more completely than any other TV show. Sexier than Cheers, less acerbic than Seinfeld, Friends existed at the sweet spot of populist mass entertainment and prescient pop escapism. If you were alive and sentient in the 1990s, you already understand this. In fact, if you were in, or near, your 20s back then and ever found yourself seated in a quirkily named coffee shop (e.g., Bean & Gone, Brewed Awakening, CU Latte) with a bunch of your own friends, you might have had the conversation: So, which Friend are you?\n\nBut while Friends inarguably excavated the Zeitgeist, it was a very different geist, in a very different Zeit. For starters, the show\u2019s run, from 1994 to 2004, corresponds almost exactly with that transformational decade when people went from signing up for this weird new thing called \u201cemail\u201d to signing up for this weird new thing called \u201cFacebook.\u201d The world of Friends is \u00adnotable, to modern eyes, for what it encompasses about being young and single and carefree in the city but also for what it doesn\u2019t encompass: social media, smartphones, student debt, the sexual politics of Tinder, moving back in with your parents as a \u00admatter of course, and a national mood that vacillates between anxiety and defeatism. (Not to mention the absence of any primary characters on the show who aren\u2019t straight or white.) Which is why you might expect that Friends, like similar cultural relics of that era, would be safely preserved in the cryogenic chamber of our collective nostalgia. And yet, astonishingly, the show is arguably as popular as it ever was \u2014 and it is popular with a cohort of young people who are only now discovering it. Which is weird. It\u2019s one thing to be young, single, and carefree in the city and drawn to a show that purports to be a reflection of your life, or, at least, some fantasy of how you\u2019d like your life to be. It\u2019s quite another to be drawn to a show that\u2019s a reflection, or a fantasy, of what life used to be like for a bunch of carefree 20-somethings 20 years ago. Because if the allure of the show is, on a basic level, all about wish-fulfillment, well, what exactly is the wish that\u2019s currently being fulfilled?\n\nThe cast all together at Central Perk.

It\u2019s inside the actual Central Perk caf\u00e9 set, which is now part of the Warner Bros. studio tour in Burbank, California. The couch \u2014 this familiar overstuffed orange sofa \u2014 is, for many people, the main attraction on the whole tour. Before our group set off in an elongated golf cart to patrol the studio\u2019s back lots, the guide asked if there were any Warner Bros. shows or movies \u2014 for example, The Big Bang Theory, The Dark Knight, or The Matrix \u2014 that people were particularly interested in seeing. \u201cFriends!\u201d came the first, quickest answer. \u201cFriends,\u201d came the second. Another woman from the back called out \u201cFriends!\u201d before someone finally said \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d Later, I asked the guide if that was a typical reaction. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d he said. \u201cFriends is definitely the biggest attraction.\u201d\n\nLast year, Danny Kahn, the executive director of the Warner Bros. tour, announced a major expansion titled \u201cStage 48: Script to Screen,\u201d which includes the stage set for Central Perk. \u201cWe\u2019d always had the set on the tour,\u201d he says \u2014 though previously it had been stored in a space that was difficult to access. Now the authentic \u00adCentral Perk sits on its own special replica soundstage, waiting for your visit. In part, the \u00addecision to highlight Central Perk was intended to draw international tourists, since the show is such a huge hit globally, but it was also a general response to persistent audience demand. In 2014, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the show\u2019s debut, Warner Bros. collaborated with a coffee company to set up a pop-up Central Perk in Manhattan. The caf\u00e9 had a two-hour wait, with lines around the block, and the main attraction was the chance to sit on a replica couch. (There have also been replica Central Perks in Beijing, Sydney, and Liverpool.)\n\nAt Stage 48, it\u2019s not unheard of for people to get engaged on the couch; a guide told me it happened just a few weeks ago. I asked him if any visitors \u2014 some of whom have traveled from across the world on a kind of pilgrimage \u2014 ever have unusual reactions when they finally sit on the couch. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople cry. All the time.\u201d\n\nIt is, of course, slightly strange that a 20-year-old sitcom still retains such a magnetic appeal; for example, Warner Bros. also produced ER, which ran for 15 seasons, but there\u2019s no opportunity, nor likely much demand, to have your photo taken on that show\u2019s authentic gurney, let alone get engaged on it. Yet Friends\u2019 popularity seems to be on the rise. Between its various syndicated airings, the show still draws a weekly audience of 16 million in the U.S., a big enough viewership to make it a viable hit on current network TV (and that\u2019s not even including streaming). In the U.K., ratings for Friends repeats are growing, up more than 10 percent in 2015 from the previous year. And as of January 1, 2015, the entire run of Friends \u2014 all 236 episodes, or 88 hours\u2019 worth \u2014 has become available on Netflix; the company paid an undisclosed sum for the rights to stream it. (The best industry guess put the price at roughly $118 million.) Netflix, notoriously, doesn\u2019t release information about how many people are watching its shows, but the sitcom appears to be \u00adwinning a whole new audience. \u201cThe social chatter was huge,\u201d says Erin Dwyer, a Netflix spokesperson. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been talking to a lot of teen-oriented outlets, like Seventeen and Teen.com, and what we\u2019ve been interested to learn is that they get just as much buzz and clicks for Friends as they do for something like Pretty Little Liars, which is on the air right now.\u201d\n\nThe tour at Warner Bros. Studios.

I have a 17-year-old daughter, and recently someone at her school asked her, \u2018Hey, have you seen this new show called Friends?\u2019 \u201d\n\nKayla and Krystie Yandoli are sisters who are currently 23 and 26. In the early aughts, when they were 9 and 12, they cemented their obsession with Friendswhile on a family trip from Connecticut to South Carolina, sitting in the backseat of a minivan equipped with a VCR. \u201cWe watched classic episodes like \u2018The One With the Prom Video\u2019 and \u2018The One Where Ross Got High\u2019 countless times,\u201d Kayla told me. Now Krystie is a staff writer, and Kayla an intern, at BuzzFeed. Both of them write about Friends, a lot. Between them, they\u2019ve written such posts as \u201c23 of Monica Geller\u2019s Most Iconic Lines on \u2018Friends\u2019 \u201d and \u201cHow Well Do You Remember the Pets From \u2018Friends\u2019 ?\u201d (Spoiler: Probably not that well, unless you remember the name of Rachel\u2019s childhood dog. It is LaPooh.) The \u00adfourth-most-popular post Krystie has ever written, with nearly 1.5 million views, is \u201c72 Truths \u2018Friends\u2019 Taught You About Life in Your Twenties.\u201d (\u201c1. Your first job won\u2019t be your dream job \u2026 72. Your friends are the family you choose for yourself.\u201d) Krystie sees many such universal truths in the show \u2014 as well as something of the DNA of what people are looking for in today\u2019s online culture. \u201cIf you write something online, the more general it is, the more people will relate to it and click on it,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s how Friends feels. It\u2019s relatable to so many people. It\u2019s almost like they made a viral show.\u201d\n\nThere are, of course, current shows about the modern lives of young urbanites, any of which would presumably be more relatable to young viewers \u2014 but, for some, those shows, in all their circa-2016 grittiness, are a little too real. \u201cI watch shows like Girls and it feels like the raw reality of life,\u201d says Kayla. \u201cFriends is like the sitcom version of life.\u201d\n\nBack in 1994, Friends both anticipated and, with its success, accelerated a burgeoning cultural fascination with young adulthood \u2014 that precarious moment when postcollegiate urbanites begin their shaky, flirty dalliance with real life (and each other). Now, of course, much of TV \u2014 much of pop culture \u2014 is fixated on exactly these young-adult relationships, whether on New Girl or Girlsor Broad City. Crane and Kauffman originally pitched Friends to NBC like this: \u201cThis show is about six people in their 20s who hang out at this coffee house.\u201d It\u2019s a deceptively simple synopsis, given that the show they delivered became the template for 20 years\u2019 worth of subsequent pop \u00adculture. When, in 2015, The \u00adHollywood Reporter asked over 2,800 industry insiders to pick their all-time favorite show, the No. 1 choice was not The Mary Tyler Moore Show (No. 19), The Sopranos (No. 6), or even \u00adSeinfeld (No. 5): It was Friends.\n\nMichelle Cerutti, who lives in Florida, has been a Friends superfan since she was a little kid, even though she was only in \u00adkindergarten when the show first aired. \u201cI\u2019m 27 years old now,\u201d she wrote to me in an email. \u201cThis connection has never changed.\u201d For a long time, she would fall asleep to DVDs of the show. \u201cWhen I was 14 years old, going on 15, I went through depression, fights with my own friends, a roller coaster of emotions,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe ONLY thing that kept me from crying were the six New Yorkers that I grew up getting to know.\u201d\n\nBeijing\u2019s \u201cCentral Perk.\u201d Photo: AP2010\n\nMore than once, when asked about the appeal of the show, a 20-something quoted back to me an iconic line that Monica says to Rachel in the pilot: \u201cWelcome to the real world. It sucks. You\u2019re gonna love it.\u201d They explain that they\u2019ve adopted the line as a kind of generational motto. Which the line was intended to be, sort of, except for a different generation. No matter \u2014 the notion has an enduring appeal, especially given that, for 20-somethings now, the real world seems suckier than ever. \u201cThe \u201990s were a great time,\u201d says Chris Mustacchio, who is 24, works in New York, and estimates he\u2019s seen every episode of Friends more than five times. Like more than a few people I talked to, he describes habitually falling asleep to the show. \u201cIf you think about it, back then there was little conflict. It was pre-9/11. You could smoke on airplanes, you could smoke in restaurants. Bill \u00adClinton was in the White House. He was the best president of all time!\u201d\n\n\u201cPost-9/11, the show became more popular,\u201d says Kauffman. \u201cAnd I think part of the reason is because it was optimistic. And certainly, with what\u2019s going on politically right now, this can feel like a darker time.\u201d\n\nKrystie Yandoli, who is now living in New York, is ostensibly getting the chance to live out all her childhood Friends fantasies. \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t live in this huge beautiful West Village apartment and sit in a coffee house all day. I\u2019m a real person who needs to pay bills,\u201d she says. Life is a lot less \u00adfrictionless than it appeared on the show, and yet she still looks to Friends for lessons. \u201cThe thing the show did the most for me is shape these ideas about friendship.\u201d Her sister agrees: \u201cYou can\u2019t really replicate the initial magic of that very first thing that really gets this connection right,\u201d says Kayla. \u201cSo much has changed, but that simple idea of friendship \u2014 that\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\nI lived through Friends, once. I was 23 years old when the show premiered, and I watched the Friends pilot under protest, prodded by my little sister. To my slacker-hardened sensibility, the show looked to be, at first glance, an anodyne attempt to chase \u201cthe youth\u201d and cash in on the sour magic of Seinfeld. But I watched. And I laughed. And I kept watching. And eventually I had the conversation. (I was Chandler.)\n\nNow I\u2019m in my 40s and there is very little about the current world \u2014 especially culturally speaking \u2014 that reminds me of the world of Friends. When I was in college, people were still brandishing dog-eared copies of Neil Postman\u2019s anti-TV polemic Amusing Ourselves to Death; now TV has shrugged off its consensus reputation as a purveyor of widespread idiocy to become the most celebrated artistic form of our time. I currently have a palm-size computer in my pocket that\u2019s smarter than Deep Blue, the supercomputer that beat Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997 \u2014 and on which, it turns out, I can stream Friends in its entirety. In 2016, we tweet. We text. We Vine. We swipe right. Friends, of course, reflects none of this. (Mentions of the internet are limited to very occasional high jinks, like Chandler meeting a woman online who turned out to be his ex-girlfriend Janice.)\n\nI am, however, surprised that a whole new generation \u2014 all of whom are presumably much more tweet-, text-, Vine-, and Tinder-friendly than I am \u2014 is feeling the same way, and expressing it by embracing the very show my generation once embraced. After all, each generation has the right to bury the icons of its forebears, just as we in our Screaming Trees T-shirts once shat all over the Eagles. Instead, these kids are going to Friends trivia nights at Asian-fusion tapas bars in midtown, and starting podcasts devoted to recapping and analyzing every single episode of the show.\n\n\u201cPart of the appeal is wish-fulfillment,\u201d says Kauffman of the show\u2019s continued appeal to younger viewers. \u201cAnd another part of it is because they\u2019re on social media all the time, so I believe they crave human contact. They crave intimacy, and intimate relationships. They\u2019re looking at screens all the time.\u201d The world of Friends is recognizable, yet devoid of today\u2019s most ardent anxieties. On Friends, \u201cin their free time, they all get together in the coffee shop to chat and catch up,\u201d says Stephanie Piko, a 21-year-old fan of the show. \u201cWhere nowadays we\u2019ll catch up really quickly, but everyone\u2019s always on their phones. Back then, it\u2019s more of a person-to-person relationship, instead of through technology.\u201d In hindsight, that era seems idyllic by comparison: a fantasy life where friends gather on a sofa, not on WhatsApp.\n\nA Central Perk simulation in Sims.\n\nIn the economically moribund, malaise-infected \u201970s, there was a similar upsurge in nostalgia for the \u201950s, as manifested in movies like Grease and shows like Happy Days. Yet now, thanks to the internet, we don\u2019t need to re-create the euphoric, prelapsarian feeling of an old show like Friends \u2014 we can just as easily stream Friends itself. In doing so, we can plug into the fantasy of a time not that long ago but in a completely different age, one that feels both familiar and contemporary in its mores and hairstyles (you can still plausibly get away with a \u201cRachel\u201d) yet fantastically more appealing in its promise of human connection, back when \u201cconnection\u201d had an entirely different meaning.\n\nI asked Elizabeth Entenman, a 27-year-old Friends fanatic, if you could make a version of Friendsabout the 20-somethings of today. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you wouldn\u2019t find six people doing nothing in the same room.\u201d Or if they were, they\u2019d all be on their phones, seeing what else is out there. On modern sitcoms like Net\u00adflix\u2019s Master of None or Love, the agony of the slowly answered, or never-answered, text is a recurring plot device, so familiar and realistic that it makes us squirm as much as the character does onscreen. There\u2019s no escapism to be had there. Instead, it reminds us of the sad modern paradox: that knowing you can reach out to anyone at anytime hasn\u2019t actually brought us any closer together.\n\nAnd so the central pleasure of watching Friends \u2014 the feeling of being cosseted in a familiar place, free of worries, surrounded by friends \u2014 has never been quite so longed-for as it is now. Paulina McGowan, who is 21, was born in 1994, the year Friends debuted. Watching it now, she says, \u201cIt would be awesome to be alive back then, when everything didn\u2019t seem so intense. It just seemed really fun.\u201d After the WB tour, having hoisted myself up from that magical couch, I found it impossible while driving around L.A. to escape \u2014 or ignore \u2014 the pop hit \u201cStressed Out,\u201d by Twenty One Pilots (current \u00adYouTube views: 152 million and counting). The song features the telling refrain: \u201cWish we could turn back time, to the good ol\u2019 days / When our momma sang us to sleep / But now we\u2019re stressed out.\u201d Eventually, we all grow up and move out of range of our mommas\u2019 voices. But I couldn\u2019t help but think of all those young people who told me they now like to fall asleep to Friends.\n\n*This article was originally published in the March 21, 2016 issue of New York Magazine.", "description": "Why so many 20-somethings want to stream a 20-year-old sitcom about a bunch of 20-somethings sitting around in a coffee shop.", "authors": ["Adam Sternbergh"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2016/03/23/23-friends-cover-story-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2016-03-20"}
