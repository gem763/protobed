Ask Superintendent Scott Kizner. In late 2018, he put forth a \u201cGender Identity and Expression\u201d proposal, which would direct schools to allow biological men to freely access locker rooms, restrooms and other private spaces reserved for girls. It would also open girls\u2019 sports to young men who claim a female \u201cgender identity,\u201d and censor speech by requiring students and teachers to use pronouns that are inconsistent with a person's biological sex.\n\nIncredibly, Superintendent Kizner proposed that, for any students who expressed discomfort sharing intimate spaces with a member of the opposite sex:\n\n\u201c[S]chool administrators and counseling staff may address the discomfort and foster an understanding of gender identity, to create a school culture that respects and values all students.\u201d\n\nIn plain English, if a girl is worried or uncomfortable with males undressing beside her in the girls\u2019 locker room, school counselors will instruct her to \u201cget over it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoreover, the [objecting] student should be given the option to use an alternative option that is made available to any student who desires more privacy.\u201d\n\nIn other words, a girl who objects can stop using the girls\u2019 locker room or restroom, and go somewhere else. Students are expected to willingly surrender their bodily privacy and dignity in the name of diversity and inclusion. The small number of boys who struggle with their gender identity get first priority on the girls\u2019 private spaces; girls who are unwilling to sacrifice their bodily privacy get second priority.\n\nSuperintendent Kizner\u2019s proposal was not implemented last year. But now, by his own admission, the new nondiscrimination policy \u201cgives [the school district] a pathway\u201d to implement a policy similar to his original proposal.\n\nA short history lesson\n\nSince we are talking about public schools, perhaps a history lesson is in order. Beginning in 2014, the U.S. Department of Education under the Obama administration published several guidance documents that redefined the meaning of \u201csex\u201d in Title IX, and required schools to treat students \u201cconsistent with their gender identity.\u201d Failure to do so could cost a school millions in federal funding. Multiple school districts responded by throwing open their locker room doors and bathrooms to the opposite sex.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nNot surprisingly, the ensuing chaos led to lawsuits in Illinois, Minnesota, Georgia, and Virginia, among others. In Georgia, a Title IX complaint was filed, alleging that a young girl was molested in the girls\u2019 bathroom by a boy who was allowed inside under a \u201ctransgender\u201d policy. The lawsuit in Virginia arose when the American Civil Liberties Union sued a school board that made the sensible choice to maintain separate restrooms for members of each sex while offering individual, private facilities for students who were uncomfortable using a facility that corresponded to their sex. By the time the case, G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, however, reason had prevailed. The Trump administration had reversed the ill-advised Obama administration directive in an effort to protect the privacy, safety, and dignity of all students. Accordingly, the U.S. Supreme Court sent the case back to the 4th Circuit for reconsideration.\n\nGloucester is ongoing, but the U.S. Supreme Court may well settle the issue this term, as it is set to hear three cases pertaining to the meaning of \u201csex\u201d under federal law. By acting when it did, the Stafford County school board has needlessly exposed the district to lawsuits or even the loss of federal funding by creating a hostile or abusive educational environment in noncompliance with Title IX.\n\nWill reason prevail?\n\nOur public schools should never advance policies that extend special privileges to a few, while eliminating commonsense protections for all. The action by the Stafford County school board was unnecessary, ill-advised, and unlawful.\n\nSchool is in session, and it\u2019s past time for our government officials to review their responsibilities to all students.", "description": "Does the embrace of tolerance require the surrender of bodily .09/12/2019 19:35:36PM EST.", "authors": ["James", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/150/687de747-a52b-43dc-aa38-8a2272e6aeb0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
