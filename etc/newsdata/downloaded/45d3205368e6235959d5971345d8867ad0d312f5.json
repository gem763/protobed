It\u2019s a lot easier for me to splurge on something that I\u2019m going to use very, very often. I love my Champion hoodies, I love my H&M hoodies, and they\u2019re good for day to day. But this is a thick, luxe, cashmere hoodie that\u2019s amazing on flights. I can dress it up with skinny Saint Laurent jeans and a nice boot, or I can just wear it with ripped jeans and sneakers. It\u2019s very carefully thought-out: The stitching on it is perfect, the collar is a little more narrow, and the hood is really nice and deep, as well. I\u2019m obsessed \u2014 this is a weird detail to be obsessed about \u2014 with ribbing. When you have high-quality ribbing, that\u2019s nice and tight and structured, there\u2019s something nice about that.\n\nI have these conversations with my stylist, Chloe Hartstein, and we always think like, Oh, who do we want to look like for this? And we\u2019ve started looking at 1990s airport aesthetic. So that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve been going for recently. Like big, chunky sweaters, tie-dye, oversized cargo pants. Or the way Lady Diana used to wear these awesome Harvard sweaters when she used to go to the gym, so there\u2019s a little bit of that as well. The one you can get online has a little logo on it. But the one that I bought was actually at a Louis pop-up, and the piece was off the runway, so it didn\u2019t even have a logo on it. Which I liked even more, because I kind of get grossed out by logos sometimes.", "description": "Antoni Porowski shares the things he can\u2019t live without, including Rimowa Original Cabin Spinner Luggage, Louis Vuitton Leather Tab Hoody, Bumble and Bumble Bb.
