Earlier this week, the league announced a multiyear partnership with social media video app TikTok to share highlights and other social videos.\n\nAccording to 2018 Comscore data cited by Reddit, 17% of Reddit users don\u2019t use Facebook , 28% don\u2019t use Twitter , 33% don\u2019t use Instagram and 43% don\u2019t use Snapchat. That was a compelling pitch, said Blake Stuchin, vice president of digital media business development for the NFL.\n\nReddit\u2019s AMAs are open forums where users can post questions, which can then be selected and answered by the guest. Users have the option to \u201cupvote\u201d a question they like, which makes it more visible to the guest and more likely to be answered.\n\nReddit users don\u2019t hesitate to post Ask Me Anything questions about controversial topics\u2014which for the NFL could include player safety, officiating, how the league handles incidents with players off the field and social-justice issues.\n\nThe league will largely leave those questions to the AMA guests to address if they want to, Mr. Stuchin said.\n\n\u201cGenerally, the participants will be representing themselves, first and foremost, and not necessarily the views of the NFL,\u201d Mr. Stuchin said. \u201cBut the bulk of the conversations we have seen on Reddit\u2014and the bulk of what people generally want to talk about\u2014is core football. Anything beyond that, it\u2019s really no different than the comments we see on any user-generated or social platform.\u201d\n\nThe NFL plans a minimum of one AMA a month over the season but expects that number to grow, Mr. Stuchin said. Former Chicago Bears wide receiver Devin Hester, NFL Network reporters and the NFL\u2019s research team have hosted AMAs under the program so far.\n\nReddit says it has 8.8 million visitors to its football communities on the platform each month. The main NFL forum has 1.4 million members, with each team also having at least one dedicated forum on the platform.\n\nThe video series will also serve as a type of marketing for Reddit as the league distributes them widely, said Alex Riccomini, senior director of business development and media partnerships at Reddit. \u201cWe are thinking of ways to help introduce Reddit to new users off platform,\u201d Ms. Riccomini said.\n\nWrite to Sahil Patel at Sahil.Patel@wsj.com", "description": "The National Football League is adding Reddit Inc. to its roster of digital marketing channels as its new season begins, hosting a series of \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d discussions on the platform as part of a broader content and advertising deal.", "authors": ["Sahil Patel", "Sahil.Patel Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104346/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
