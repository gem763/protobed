Twitch is owned by Amazon, the company led by Jeff Bezos \u2014 and both Amazon and Bezos are frequent targets for Trump\u2019s displeasure.\n\nIt appears Trump recently joined Twitch, and has just over 135 followers at the time of this writing. He isn\u2019t currently live streaming, nor is it likely that he\u2019s about to jump into a game of Fortnite. Instead, his channel features a prominent message reminding viewers of his rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota happening tonight. There\u2019s also a button further down the page that encourages supporters to donate to his campaign.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the first political candidate to use Twitch in an effort to connect more directly with voters. Bernie Sanders, for instance, is also using the service. Trump, however, has a history of denigrating the company\u2019s owner, Amazon.\n\nBack when he was running for president in 2016, he condemned Bezos\u2019 ownership of The Washington Post, citing the purchase as an opportunity for Amazon to receive positive coverage. An important distinction to make is that Amazon doesn\u2019t own The Post; a holding company started by Bezos called Nash Holdings bought the Post in 2013 for $250 million. Still, Trump argued that Bezos, who owns both Amazon and Nash Holdings, bought The Post so that \u201cAmazon will benefit from it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I become president, oh do they have problems,\u201d Trump said at a Texas event in February 2016. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have such problems.\u201d\n\nTrump, however, has a history of denigrating the company\u2019s owner, Amazon\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign against Amazon didn\u2019t end in February 2016. He frequently refers to The Washington Post as \u201cThe Amazon Washington Post\u201d in tweets criticizing the company. Trump gave an interview to Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity in 2016, conflating The Post\u2019s editorial standards with Amazon\u2019s business, calling out Bezos for using The Post as a \u201ctoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon is getting away with murder, tax-wise,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s using The Washington Post for power. So that the politicians in Washington don\u2019t tax Amazon like they should be taxed... and what they\u2019ve done is he bought this paper for practically nothing. And he\u2019s using that as a tool for political power against me and against other people. And I\u2019ll tell you what: We can\u2019t let him get away with it.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end with The Washington Post, either. Just this August, Trump via the White House ordered the Department of Defense to look into and reexamine a $10 billion contract regarding cloud computing \u201cbecause of concerns that the deal would go to Amazon,\u201d according to The Post. Trump even argued that Amazon was taking advantage of the United States\u2019 Postal service by using a low-rates system. Amazon, Trump said, \u201cshould pay these costs (plus) and not have them borne by the American Taxpayer.\u201d\n\nSo Trump really, really doesn\u2019t like Amazon. But unlike The Washington Post, which isn\u2019t owned by Amazon, Twitch is. Amazon bought the streaming company for $1 billion in 2014, and has been involved in the business ever since. Again, Trump isn\u2019t the only politician on Twitch who has issues with Amazon \u2014 Sanders has made it clear where he stands on the company\u2019s overarching power in various American industries \u2014 but few politicians have gone on a tirade against the company like Trump has.\n\nBy logging on to Twitch, Trump appears to have conceded something significant: if he wants to connect with his supporters, he\u2019s going to have to play by Jeff Bezos\u2019 rules, on Jeff Bezos\u2019 platform.", "description": "President Donald Trump has joined streaming service Twitch as part of his re-election strategy, but Twitch is owned by Amazon, the company led by Jeff Bezos \u2014 and both Amazon and Bezos are frequent targets for Trump\u2019s displeasure.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9ljtzVTLlnOXsrSipPZoukFkVA=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18963835/acastro_190812_1777_twitch_0002.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
