The period granted is unusually short for a private hire licence. TfL could have granted a new term of up to five years.\n\nThe transport body previously removed Uber\u2019s right to operate in the city in September 2017 due to alleged failings in its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Sadiq Khan must use this two-month license review period to insist Uber respect UK employment law as a condition of license.\u201d\n\nThe London Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association described Uber as a \u201cthreat to public safety\u201d.\n\nLTDA general secretary Steve McNamara said: \u201cOver the last 15 months Uber was supposed to change its operations for the better, but the firm has continued to shirk its responsibilities. The granting of the shortest operator\u2019s licence ever shows the Mayor doesn\u2019t trust Uber, and neither should Londoners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time the Mayor pulled the plug on Uber\u2019s immoral operation for good.\u201d", "description": "Uber\u00a0has been granted a two-month extension to its licence to operate in London which had been suspended in 2017 over concerns the company was not a \u201cfit and proper\u201d private car hire operator.", "authors": ["Ben Chapman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/08/uber.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
