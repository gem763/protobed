(AP) - The Denver Broncos are envisioning ways to stop Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThe visuals will have to suffice. They\u2019re not simulating the Kansas City Chiefs and their dynamic quarterback at full speed during practice this week with such a short turnaround.\n\nThey\u2019re basically holding a series of walkthroughs rather than exerting energy ahead of their Thursday night showdown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard, particularly playing an offense as prolific as this. You\u2019d like to go out there and experience playing against some of their plays - at least at a practice tempo,\u201d Broncos coach Vic Fangio said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to do that totally this week. It\u2019s a major, major adjustment from a weekly schedule.\u201d\n\nVon Miller won\u2019t deviate from his customary routine to get ready as the Broncos try to snap a seven-game losing streak against Kansas City. Instead, he will condense everything. So his customary every-other-day plunges into a cold tub to get his body ready will have to come on a back-to-back-to-back basis.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s the energy of playing the Chiefs in front of a national audience to boost him, too. The Broncos (2-4) enter on a two-game winning streak after starting out 0-4 while the Chiefs (4-2) have dropped two in a row following a perfect September.\n\nSuddenly, the Broncos have a real chance to jump right back into the AFC West race.\n\n\u201cI mean, everything is great about it except the short time span between games,\u201d Miller said. \u201cEverything else is super exciting. Going against the Kansas City Chiefs, division rival, versus Patrick Mahomes, one of the best quarterbacks there is - they\u2019re going to be ready to play. It\u2019s going to be a great night.\u201d\n\nThe lighter-than-usual prep work for the Broncos includes mental reps in practice and plenty of film work. That and anything else to get the body right.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to try to recover any way you can,\u201d safety Kareem Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to take those couple of extra steps or extra stretches or do whatever you\u2019ve got to do to try to get your body back to somewhat of reasonable shape so you can go out there and perform on Thursday. It will definitely take every day this week.\n\n\u201cAs pros, it\u2019s part of the job and you\u2019ve just go to know what your body is going to need.\u201d\n\nBecause Mahomes, bum ankle and all, promises to be a handful.\n\nHe\u2019s thrown 14 touchdown passes with just one interception this season. As for whether the Broncos want to keep him inside the pocket or flush him out, well, it\u2019s a pick-your-poison sort of deal.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s hard to forget the right-handed Mahomes\u2018 left-handed throw last season in Denver on a Monday night. It was all the buzz on social media. As he scrambled to his left on third-and-5 in the fourth quarter, Mahomes switched the ball to his other hand so Miller couldn\u2019t strip it from him. Then, Mahomes lofted a perfect strike to receiver Tyreek Hill for a 6-yard gain and the first down as the Chiefs rallied for a 27-23 win.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s able to make throws inside the pocket, outside the pocket, all over,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe can beat you in all types of ways.\u201d\n\nEspecially if the Chiefs can establish their ground game. Stopping that is high on Denver\u2019s to-do list, because \u201cif they get started running the ball and they run it all over the place, it\u2019s going to be impossible to win that game,\u201d Miller said.\n\nThe Colts and Texans both won at Arrowhead Stadium this month by running the ball and keeping Mahomes on the sideline. The Broncos will try to do the same behind running backs Phillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to come in energized and ready to go, knowing that this one is a big one for them and a big one for us,\u201d safety Justin Simmons said. \u201cIt will be good.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Fangio didn\u2019t have updates on Broncos WR Emmanuel Sanders (knee) or OL Ja\u2019Wuan James (knee). \u2026 DE Adam Gotsis has been inactive for the last two games after starting three of the opening four contests. \u201cNaturally, he was disappointed,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cHe\u2019s handled it well as a good teammate would.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Denver Broncos are envisioning ways to stop Patrick Mahomes.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/titans_broncos_football_18007_c0-213-5116-3197_s1200x700.jpg?85049894e91b81ddd7daa3ac1e0eeb0ce88c5543", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
