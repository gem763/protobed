The paper is once again engulfed in a familiar maelstrom, taking heavy incoming from both sides on Twitter and cable news. It began over the weekend, with an adaptation from Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly\u2019s new book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh. Their excerpt surfaced a previously unreported allegation, from former Yale classmate Max Stier, that Kavanaugh\u2019s friends once \u201cpushed his penis into the hand of a female student\u201d during a drunken dorm party. It also reported that \u201cMr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the FBI about this account, but the FBI did not investigate.\u201d\n\nWow, indeed.\n\nAnd it turns out the editors were right considering @rpogrebin and @katekelly now have egg on their face bc of their story yesterday WITHOUT including the fact the woman in question has said she has no idea what people are talking about, the Washington Post ALSO took a pass \u2014 Michael (@Michael2014abc) September 17, 2019\n\nUtterly disgusting \u2014 Deezy (@DmanfeldDeezy) September 17, 2019\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget totally desperate.\n\ni wouldn\u2019t trust anything from the NYT, not even a grocery discount coupon. \u2014 Mike Wells (@tastytradeninja) September 17, 2019\n\nOuch.\n\nThat\u2019s what you call \u201cnews analysis\u201d \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) September 17, 2019\n\nOr \u2026 wait for it \u2026 FAKE NEWS.\n\nRelated:\n\nThis freakin\u2019 GUY \u2013> Sen.
