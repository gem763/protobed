The company reported earnings of 33 cents per share, while analysts were expecting earnings per share of 26 cents, according to Refinitiv. PetMed has missed estimates the last three quarters.\n\nDespite beating expectations, PetMed's net income fell about 36% since the same period last year as PetMed was forced to lower prices in a competitive pet-loving environment.\n\n\"Sales were negatively impacted by increased online competition and aggressive pricing in the market that forced us to reduce prices,\" said Menderes Akdag, PetMed chief executive officer, on the earnings call.", "description": "PetMed Express soared more than 30% on Monday after the online pet pharmacy said its quarterly profit topped Wall Street's estimates.", "authors": ["Maggie Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106032035-1563797507479gettyimages-694935984.jpeg?v=1571670664", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
