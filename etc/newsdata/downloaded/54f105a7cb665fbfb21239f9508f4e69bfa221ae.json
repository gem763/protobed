The game will also be a launch title for Google\u2019s much-anticipated streaming platform, Stadia.\n\nEnhanced Graphics and New Story Mode Content\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, the PC version packs a bevy of graphical enhancements from the console edition that Rockstar is banking on to up the immersion of an already ultra-realistic cowboy sim. Additionally, Rockstar says the PC version adds new story mode content along the lines of new gang hideouts, bounty hunting missions, weapons, and more.\n\nRockstar\u2019s Pre-order-Bating Bonuses\n\nPre-orders are now open via the freshly released Rockstar Games Launcher; a shrewd strategy by our estimation. Those among you that lay their cash down early for Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC can secure a host of exclusive content including an outlaw survival kit, a warhorse, a treasure map, a cash bonus, and a generous helping of gold bars for Red Dead Online, the games multiplayer component.\n\nTo further entice people, Rockstar is offering two free games for those that pre-order for a selection that includes three Grand Theft Auto titles, Bully: Scholarship Edition, Max Payne 3: The Complete Edition, and LA Noire: The Complete Edition.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 Also Available On Epic Store, and Steam Later On\n\nIf Rockstar\u2019s own launcher isn\u2019t your cup of tea, Red Dead Redemption 2 is available to pre-order via other digital storefronts, including the Epic Games Store, the charitable man\u2019s store of choice, the Humble Store, and flagging brick and mortar retailer GameStop.\n\nThere\u2019s one caveat, though; pre-orders via third-party retailers only start from Oct. 23, and the bonus is a mere 25 gold bars. Rockstar also stated a Steam version of Red Dead Redemption 2 is on the way this December.\n\nSadly, the announcement didn\u2019t feature any in-game screenshots, but Rockstar promises these will be available on Oct. 9, alongside the system requirements and a fleshing out of what we can expect from the PC version.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RDR2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
