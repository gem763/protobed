Pauley granted the motion on Friday - four years after Roberto Grant was killed inside the government facility while awaiting sentencing for a series of jewelry heists.\n\nIn his report, Judge Pauley referenced the recent suicide of pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, which occurred at the same center, writing: 'The death high-profile defendant has reinvigorated public scrutiny of MCC.'\n\nHe added: 'The unexplained circumstances surrounding Mr. Grant's death raise troubling questions about the Bureau of Prisons' oversight of individuals remanded to its custody. Mr Grant's relatives \u2013 and the public - have an interest in learning what happened'.\n\nAccording to Grant's ex-wife, Nicole Morrison, Grant had expressed concerns that he was being 'harassed and physically threatened' inside the MCC prior to his death on May 19, 2015.\n\nJewellery thief Roberto Grant was bashed to death inside the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in May 2015.
