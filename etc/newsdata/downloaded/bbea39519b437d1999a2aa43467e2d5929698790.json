(Mark Humphrey/AP)\n\nSports columnist\n\nDaniel Hudson can talk and talk about his decision, but that would lend credence to the idea that it was a decision at all.\n\n\u201cI knew I was going to go no matter what,\u201d Hudson said Saturday.\n\nThat\u2019s really all we need to know. Hudson is a pitcher and a father. He is a teammate and a husband. He has a job and a life. His non-choice was to be with his family for the birth of his third child Thursday. That little Millie Hudson didn\u2019t arrive until Friday morning is an inconvenience, not a catastrophe nor a debate. That it could have impacted Game 1 of the National League Championship Series is a byproduct of what Hudson needed to do, and nothing more.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t exactly plan to have a baby in the middle of the playoffs,\u201d Hudson said, a few hours before securing the final two outs of a 3-1 victory in Game 2 that gave the Washington Nationals a 2-0 lead in this best-of-seven National League Championship Series.\n\nThe Washington Nationals won the first game of the NLCS over the St. Louis Cardinals without Hudson, who arrived via a midseason trade and became the club\u2019s closer out of necessity. All this time, his wife had a due date: Oct. 14. That led the Daniel and Sara Hudson to get out their calendars and start mapping out days. If the Nats won the wild-card game, and if the division series against the Los Angeles Dodgers was pushed to a decisive fifth game, maybe Daniel could shoot home to Phoenix, Sara could pop out the kid on command, and the Nats\u2019 run could be continued unhindered.\n\n[Max Scherzer gives Nationals their second straight gem, and a 2-0 series lead over Cardinals]\n\nExcept this whole miracle-of-life thing can\u2019t really be coordinated on iCal.\n\n\u201cYou try to plan something,\u201d Hudson said, \u201cand everything goes crazy.\u201d\n\nTry to make a controversy out of this. I mean, if you\u2019re a small-minded thief of a washed-up former baseball executive \u2014 like David Samson, the ex-president of the Marlins \u2014 then maybe you try to label Hudson\u2019s move as \u201cunreal,\u201d and poke the bear.\n\n\u201cOnly excuse would be a problem with the birth or health of baby or mother,\u201d Samson tweeted Friday. \u201cIf all is well, he needs to get to St. Louis. Inexcusable.\u201d\n\nNice job, buddy! Encourage speculation about the health of the mother in a private moment, all while questioning the father\u2019s professional commitment. But that\u2019s where Hudson found himself Friday, holding his youngest daughter as he tried to watch his teammates take a step toward a pennant, all while finding himself as the main talking point of a discourse on commitment to family and profession, on the balance between home and work.\n\n\u201cI went from not having a job on March 21 to this huge national conversation on family values going into the playoffs,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cLike, hey. Life comes at you fast, man. I don\u2019t know how that happened and how I became the face for whatever conversation was going on.\u201d\n\n[Juan Soto\u2019s shuffle draws scrutiny \u2014 and some ire]\n\nYou know who thinks that\u2019s ridiculous? The Nationals.\n\n\u201cIt was a no-brainer,\u201d General Manager Mike Rizzo said.\n\nThat\u2019s not just because the Nats survived \u2014 and even thrived \u2014 without Hudson in Game 1. They got 7 \u2154 sparkling innings from An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, then four rocking-chair outs from Sean Doolittle. After the game, Manager Dave Martinez texted his absent closer: \u201cHey, I got a name for your little girl: Anibala Sean Hudson.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife got a good kick out of that,\u201d Hudson said.\n\nWhat the Hudsons didn\u2019t get a kick out of: the wait for little Millie to arrive. The rules at their Phoenix hospital, which only make sense: Those mothers who are having children naturally get their turns before those who are hoping to induce. So even though Hudson had a 7 a.m. flight from Los Angeles to Phoenix on Thursday \u2014 only hours after the Nats had closed out the Dodgers \u2014 Sara wasn\u2019t immediately able to get a room. They had to wait until Thursday night to check into the hospital. Millie didn\u2019t arrive until early Friday.\n\n\u201cStubborn little thing,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nThat\u2019s important to keep in mind here if you have even the slightest inclination to believe Hudson was shirking his duties. In fact, he tried to set up the birth of his child around the baseball schedule. But after Millie arrived, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s unlimited flights from Phoenix to St. Louis, and it\u2019s not like \u2014 even if Hudson could have caught one \u2014 he would have been mentally or physically prepared to protect a 2-0 lead in the ninth.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of sleep the last few nights,\u201d Hudson said.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened. The point is, the Nats bought into the idea.\n\n\u201cThese decisions are easy,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cA happy player is a performing player. We\u2019ve got to take care of our people. You have to treat this like a family. And the important thing is, we\u2019ve got a new little member of the Nationals family.\u201d\n\nThere was a time, and it wasn\u2019t all that long ago, when baseball executives would have uttered something far different, and likely unprintable. We are no longer in that time. MLB first instituted a paternity list \u2014 a minimum of one day missed, a maximum of three \u2014 in 2011. But they hadn\u2019t considered such an accommodation for October until the case of a Toronto pitcher named Aaron Loup in 2015.\n\nLoup\u2019s wife unexpectedly gave birth during the division series, and because there was no way to replace him on the roster, the Blue Jays had to play short. That offseason, MLB changed the rules. Yet the postseason paternity list had never been used \u2014 until now.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I can\u2019t be the only person to have a baby in the middle of the postseason,\u2019 \u201d Hudson said. \u201cAnd for it to blow up like it did, man, it\u2019s kind of crazy.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s crazy is how big leaguers used to handle all this. Rizzo pointed to one of his own lieutenants, Bob Boone, who had a 19-year major league career.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he saw any of his three kids born,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a different world now.\u201d\n\nThank goodness. This is what any employee wants: The backing of his bosses and his colleagues so he can make the best decisions for himself and his family. That\u2019s all this is.\n\n\u201cI heard somebody say one time: Baseball\u2019s what I do, it\u2019s not who I am,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cOnce I had kids, it really resonated with me. So to be able to be a part of that was awesome. And can\u2019t thank the Nationals organization enough for being understanding.\u201d\n\nWhat a ride. What a story. Oh, and Daniel, one last thing: Congratulations. Now, there\u2019s a World Series berth at stake. Go ahead and pitch.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.", "description": "The closer made the decision to be with his wife for the birth of their daughter.
