But the images of the devastation have affected everyone from tour operators on the islands to U.S.-based travel agents who help connect travelers with cruise ships and activities.\n\nHighlighting the destruction, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was \"horrified\" on Saturday after taking an aerial tour of Abaco.\n\n\"I've never seen such a level of systematic devastation,\" Guterres told reporters. \"Hurricane Dorian has been classified as Category 5, I think it is Category Hell, but it was not powered by the devil.\"\n\nTourism last year accounted for $5.7 billion, about half the country's gross domestic product, according to Thompson.\n\nAway from Nassau's tourist strip, luxury hotels were also bustling. At Baha Mar, an opulent hotel and entertainment complex, the casino floor was littered with vacationers shooting craps, sipping martinis at a piano bar and ordering $100-plus platters of sushi.\n\nJust over 90 miles (145 km) to the north, the hunt for bodies continued amid the wreckage of Abaco, where the United Nations' World Food Programme says about 90% of structures were destroyed.\n\n\"This has devastated our spirits and we are mourning with our friends who lost loved but the reality is that life has to go on,\" said construction company owner Jackson Brennen, 57, who was celebrating his wife's birthday at Nassau's Baha Mar.\n\n\"Only two of the islands were devastated, we're still open for business, but it's very difficult because the pain hasn't stopped.\"\n\nDave Curry, 37, who followed his father into the tour business, has run Simply Dave Nassau Tours for the last 20 years. His day trips pull people away from the high prices and tourist traps of downtown Nassau to visit historical sites and a local flea market in residential areas.\n\nSince Dorian, Curry said his bookings had dropped by about a quarter due to a rash of cancellations.\n\nThe slowdown has delivered a kind of one-two punch, as the Bahamas moves into a seasonal lull following the U.S. Labor Day holiday weekend.\n\nCurry likened recent events to the period after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, when many people in the Bahamas had friends and family who were impacted.\n\n\"It was a time of remorse, it was a time of stillness and consciousness and that's what you feel right now on the islands,\" Curry said.\n\nU.S. visitors are among those who have thought twice about Bahamas trips after viewing images of Dorian's devastation.\n\n\"We've seen 450 to 550 changes and cancellations,\" said Gus Machado, sales director at Brickell Travel in Miami.\n\nWhile some canceled trips out of fear of getting caught in storm force winds, Machado said others were simply frightened out of travel by the idea of seeing devastated islands.\n\nThat mindset is something Thompson and others in the tourism ministry hope to fight by emphasizing that islands such as Eleuthera, his personal favorite, boast tranquil pink sand beaches ripe for visitors.\n\n\"The business of tourism has to go on in order for us to get the revenue to rebuild,\" Thompson said.\n\n\"The best way you can help is to continue to visit the islands of the Bahamas and while you\u2019re here maybe stay an extra day, and spend an extra $50.\"", "description": "Bahamas tourist industry hopes for quick comeback from 'Category Hell' storm", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8E09W_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
