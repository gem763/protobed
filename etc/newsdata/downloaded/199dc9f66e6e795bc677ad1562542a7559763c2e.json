Chris Hopkins\n\nThere are no politics quite as compelling as private school politics, especially in that gossipy village John Batman gave us: Melbourne. Who could forget the Louise Adler/Rosa Storelli conflagration at Methodist Ladies College in 2012?\n\nAt Melbourne Grammar School Roy Kelley is concluding his decade as headmaster, to be succeeded next year by Philip Grutzner \u2013 in 161 years, the first alumnus ever to lead it.\n\nThe school council (which hires and fires the principal), as you might imagine, is veritably groaning with accomplishment. It includes cardiothoracic surgeon Julian Smith, paediatrician Amanda Day and particle physicist Geoffrey Taylor, tax silk Philip Solomon, former mining boss Andrew Michelmore and Flagstaff Partners\u2019 Geoff Cohen. Its chairman is former institutional broker, now SG Hiscock director, Michael Bartlett.\n\nAt a school assembly on Monday, Kelley announced that next year\u2019s school captain will be none other than Tom Bartlett. Yes, the chairman\u2019s deserving son, a standout leader among nearly 200 men.\n\nThis time three years ago, there arose no small degree of consternation among the school\u2019s long-suffering parents when Kelley announced that Nick Bartlett, another meritorious heir of the chairman, would be 2017 school captain. Sheer, rancid jealousy! Better yet, Nick\u2019s vice captain also happened to be his twin brother, Richard Bartlett.
