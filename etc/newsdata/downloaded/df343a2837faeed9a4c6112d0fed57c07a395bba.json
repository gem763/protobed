Love Island Australia's T\u00e9a (right) was sent home on Sunday night's show. Pictured with fellow dumped islander Angel\n\nWhen asked if she thinks there could have been a more cultural mix on-screen, she said: 'I think there definitely could've been, it definitely would've been good.'\n\nHowever, she also had a theory as to why it might not always be possible.\n\n'...at the same time, it's people who do apply,' she added.\n\nNot happy: The show was previously slammed by fans over it's lack of diversity\n\n'Some people don't feel that's something they want to do because with reality TV, it's a bit hard to put yourself out there.'\n\nAt the beginning of the series, viewers accused the show of 'racism' when West African-born Cynthia Taylu, who was Love Island Australia's first black participant, was the last to be picked for a date by the men.\n\nTaking to social media, viewers raged over the 23-year-old model's lack of airtime after she was relegated to the background during Tuesday's episode.\n\nIssue: At the beginning of the series, viewers accused the show of 'racism' when West African-born Cynthia Taylu (pictured), who was Love Island Australia's first black participant, was the last to be picked for a date by the men\n\n'Can #LoveIslandAU producers at least pretend to care about Cynthia,' tweeted one.\n\nAnother wrote: 'Have you noticed that we haven't heard ONE WORD from Cynthia in tonight's show?\n\n'She's an effing human being, not a 'we'll just put a black person in there to show we're diverse'. All of this is gross.'\n\n'They're not showing her partner either': One viewer reasoned that Cynthia's white partner Sam Withers did not get much airtime either\n\nHowever, not everybody was convinced that Cynthia's lack of airtime was related to race, with some reasoning that the model doesn't have a storyline and that her Caucasian partner Sam Withers was also cut out of the episode.\n\n'They're not showing her partner either,' wrote one. 'I can't even remember his name.'\n\nAnother tweeted: 'Each episode is a story, and they tell that story with the key players. Cynthia isn't a key player in this particular story, so she isn't given much airtime. It's not racism, it's just TV.'", "description": "Dumped Love Island star Tea Fraser has given her opinion on why there appears to be a lack of diversity on the Channel Seven show.", "authors": ["Nicole Douglas For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/14/20245934-0-image-a-3_1572186232521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
