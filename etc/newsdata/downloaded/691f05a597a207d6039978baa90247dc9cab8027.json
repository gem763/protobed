Ator called 911, complaining about his employer, but left before officers responded.\n\nLater, in the afternoon, he called a national FBI tip line with \u201crambling statements about some of the atrocities that he thought he had gone through,\u201d said FBI Special Agent Christopher Combs. In neither call did Ator make any threats, authorities said, but the FBI began trying to find out who he was.\n\nThese and other details about the alleged shooter began to emerge Monday, some 48 hours after the shooting. Ator shot 29 people as he drove between Odessa and nearby Midland on Saturday afternoon, firing at random and hijacking a U.S. Postal Service van, authorities said. Ator died when officers intercepted and shot him outside a movie theater.\n\nIn addition to the seven killed, 22 others were injured, according to law enforcement. Those killed ranged in age from 15 to 57.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is still investigating how Ator obtained the rifle he used in the killings, said John Wester, an ATF assistant special agent, on Monday.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a tweet Monday that Ator had previously failed a background check to purchase a gun in Texas. \u201cWe must keep guns out of criminals\u2019 hands,\u201d Mr. Abbott wrote.\n\nAbout 15 minutes after the call to the FBI, Department of Public Safety troopers, unaware of any of Ator\u2019s calls, pulled him over for failing to use a turn signal.\n\nBefore the vehicle came to a stop, Ator pointed a rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired several shots toward the DPS patrol unit, shooting a trooper, authorities said.\n\nAtor then began a tear through the city that left more than a dozen crime scenes. He shot two other police officers. He hit a 17-month-old baby in the face. He killed a mail carrier before stealing her postal van to continue shooting.\n\nThe two police officers that were shot are in fair condition, according to Medical Center Hospital spokesman Trevor Tankersley. The trooper, as of Sunday, was in serious but stable condition and was expected to recover.\n\nThe baby\u2019s mother, Kelby Giesler Davis, wrote on Facebook that her daughter Anderson had been released from University Medical Center in Lubbock after surgery on her mouth and chest Monday.\n\nAtor was killed after police confronted him near a Cinergy movie theater. Authorities suggested that he may have been planning to continue his attacks inside the crowded theater.\n\nAuthorities said Monday that Ator\u2019s mental state had apparently been declining long before the killings. His home, outside of Odessa, was \u201ca strange residence,\u201d Mr. Combs said. Mr. Gerke said he had heard, but not confirmed, reports of Ator being fired from at least one other job recently.\n\n\u201cHe was on a long spiral of going down,\u201d said Mr. Combs. \u201cHe didn\u2019t wake up Saturday morning and go into his company and it happened. He went to that company already in trouble. He\u2019d probably been in trouble for a while.\u201d\n\nOdessa Mayor David Turner said Sunday there was no indication that the shooting was motivated by any particular ideology. \u201cI think it\u2019s just someone with some problems,\u201d he said. Law-enforcement officials Sunday said they didn\u2019t suspect that Ator had ties to domestic or international terror groups.\n\nPublic records show Ator previously pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges, for criminal trespass and evading arrest, in Central Texas in 2001. Mr. Gerke said his previous interactions with the Odessa Police Department had been \u201cvery minor incidents that would not have had any impact.\u201d\n\nThe shooting came less than a month after mass shootings in Texas and Ohio left at least 31 dead and about 50 injured in the space of 24 hours. Twenty-two of the dead were killed by a gunman in an El Paso Walmart .\n\nOn Sunday, the governor recounted the string of mass shootings he has seen during his tenure in Texas, saying \u201cthe status quo in the state of Texas is not acceptable.\u201d He said he and other lawmakers are meeting daily to discuss possible solutions to such shootings.\n\n\u201cI am heartbroken by the crying of the people of the state of Texas,\u201d Mr. Abbott said. \u2018I\u2019m tired of the dying of the people of the state of Texas.\u201d", "description": "Seth Ator, the suspect alleged to have killed seven people in a shooting rampage Saturday, was fired from his job and called 911 and the FBI tip line in the hours before opening fire in and around Odessa.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Findell"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103376/social"}
