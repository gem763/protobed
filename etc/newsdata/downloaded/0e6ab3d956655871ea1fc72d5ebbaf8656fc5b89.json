Both of these developments are newsworthy. The reduction in the poverty rate is good news and reflects several years of a strong economy. The reduction in health care coverage is startling given that the unemployment rate is at an all-time low.\n\nWhile commentators are focused on poverty and coverage, the thing that always interests me the most from these reports is how little income most American families have and how little these amounts have grown over time.\n\nIf you hang out in the Northeast and talk to financial types and academics who worry about pensions and retirement income, it is easy to get lulled into the notion that the mass affluent \u2014 the upper middle of the income distribution \u2014 have incomes of about $250,000. The truth is that if your household has $250,000, you\u2019re in the top 5%. That\u2019s evident in the table below, which shows the thresholds for being in different parts of the income distribution.\n\nFor example, a household with income of $63,179 is at the 50th percentile mark, right in the middle of the income distribution. A household with an income of $184,282 is at the 90th percentile point, or in the top 10th of the income distribution. And, as noted, $248,728 puts you in the top 5%.\n\nHousehold income at selected percentiles, 2018\n\nPercentile Dollar limit 10th $14,629 20th $25,600 50th (median) $63,179 80th $130,000 90th $184,292 95th $248,728 Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2019, Income and Poverty in the United States, Table A-4\n\nThe thresholds must be interpreted with caution, though, because households include old and young, urban and rural, coastal and midland, and small and large. Yet, the data clearly show that those households with incomes of $250,000 are in the top 5% of households.\n\nIn addition to most families having relatively little money, median household income in constant 2018 dollars has changed very little since 1978 and is only slightly above its earlier peak in 1999 (see table below).\n\nMedian household income in 2018 dollars, 1978, 1999, 2017, and 2018\n\nYear Median household income 2018 $63,179 2017 $62,626 1999 (earlier peak) $61,526 1978 $53,359 Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2019, Income and Poverty in the United States, Table A-4\n\nThe reason that household income has not gone up very much is that earnings have been stagnant (see table below). While real earnings for all male workers in 2018 were above what they were in 1978, for full-time year-round workers they were lower even after two years with the unemployment rate below 4%.\n\nMedian earnings of male workers in 2018 dollars, 1978, 1999, 2017, and 2018\n\nYear All workers Full-time, year-round 2018 $46,741 $55,291 2017 $46,166 $53,459 1999 $45,475 $55,018 1978 $42,977 $55,718 Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2019, Income and Poverty in the United States, Table A-7\n\nFor those of us interested in retirement security, these numbers create an enormous challenge. Social Security will not provide enough for the median household with $63,000 to maintain its standard of living. But saving for retirement would surely be a low priority item for households facing pressing demands for their dollars. Workers in these families need an easy and automatic way to save, but many do not have a retirement plan at work. Closing the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d is a key requirement for improving retirement security in this country.", "description": "This issue poses an enormous challenge for retirement security", "authors": ["Alicia H.
