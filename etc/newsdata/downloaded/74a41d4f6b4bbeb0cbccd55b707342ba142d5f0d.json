A trickle of polite, old-fashioned letters became a torrent \u2013 and a popular uprising was under way.\n\nThe correspondence was not confined to this newspaper. Barclays\u2019 American boss Jes Staley learned first-hand of the power of the media when it comes to consumer issues. A corner of his office was stacked with letters mainly written by hand in spindly script. Friends say the passion of this elderly army personally moved Staley, and an about turn became necessary.\n\nWhen this paper revealed that Barclays wanted to stop customers accessing cash through post offices, we had little idea of the firestorm which would be unleashed\n\nBut getting a bank the size of Barclays to recognise its missteps was an uphill task. When its judgment was questioned, the communications machine went on the defensive \u2013 seeking to claim that what it was doing was somehow in customers\u2019 best interest. Such unsympathetic responses are beneath contempt for an organisation with tens of millions of customers.\n\nStaley has creditably not sought to escape responsibility for a crass decision which undermined years of effort aimed at getting consumers onside. Instead of blaming managers lower down the food chain, he privately admits to signing off the policy which has caused the bank so much aggravation. But he also had the good grace to recognise a grave mistake and order that it be reversed.\n\nThe cause was also embraced by MPs on the business select committee. Its report echoed the views of our silver protesters, calling Barclays\u2019 decision a \u2018retrograde step\u2019 which undermines an already struggling post office network \u2013 and hits poorly paid sub-postmasters, much of whose work amounts to a public service in its own right.\n\nOver the last two decades, Britain\u2019s banks have closed thousands of branches as they have sought to cut costs and encourage customers online. As this transformation took place \u2013 Barclays alone shut more than 480 branches over the last five years \u2013 the bankers promised a new social contract with the public. There were pledges never to close the last bank in town and where that had happened the post offices would become the bank of last resort.\n\nThe savings from closing the post office facility, put at around \u00a37million a year, must be considered footling compared to annual profits of \u00a33.5billion\n\nAs Barclays sought to modernise, they appear to have given negligible thought to Britain\u2019s pensioners \u2013 many without easy access to public transport and the internet \u2013 who would be deprived of banking.\n\nBusinesses are always looking at ways of cutting costs and Barclays has long been opposed to the concept of free banking. Yet the savings from closing the post office facility, put at around \u00a37million a year, must be considered footling compared to annual profits of \u00a33.5billion.\n\nBy listening to Mail readers, charities and consumer groups, Barclays showed even hard-nosed Wall Street veterans, such as Staley, are not immune to public clamour.\n\nOne trusts that next time the bank blunders into a folly, it will think twice. But one should never underestimate the stupidity of the Master of the Universe when it comes to making common sense decisions.", "description": "When this paper revealed that Barclays wanted to stop customers accessing cash through post offices, we had little idea of the firestorm which would be unleashed, writes ALEX BRUMMER.", "authors": ["Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/21/20153038-0-image-a-29_1571949970036.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
