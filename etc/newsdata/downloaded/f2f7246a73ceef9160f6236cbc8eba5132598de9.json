The study was published in Lancet Neurology Journal.\n\nAFP\n\nThe patient named Thibault trained for months, teaching his brain to send signals to a computer simulator of the exoskeleton to perform basic movements before he got into the physical exoskeleton.\n\nAccording to Thibault, who lives in Lyon, this technology has given his life another chance. He suffered from paralysis after falling 40-feet from a balcony of a night club that severely damaged his spinal cord, leaving him paralysed below the shoulders.\n\nDon't Miss 273 SHARES 19.9 K SHARES\n\nHe says, \"When you are in my position, when you can't do anything with your body ... I wanted to do something with my brain.\"\n\nHe further added, \"I can't go home tomorrow in my exoskeleton but I've got to a point where I can walk. I walk when I want and I stop when I want.\"\n\nAccording to Alim Loius Benabid, professor emeritus at Grenoble and lead author of the study, \"The brain is still capable of generating commands that would normally move the arms and legs, there's just nothing to carry them out.\"\n\nResearchers from Grenoble Alpes hospital, the biomedical company Cinatech and the CEA research centre booted this project by implanting two recording devices either side of Thibault's head, between the brain and the skin. These sensors recorded his sensorimotor cortex, that is responsible for controlling motor function.\n\nThe Lancet / YouTube\n\nEach decoder sends brain signals, which are deciphered by an algorithm into the movements the patient wants to execute.\n\nHe trained on an avatar on a video game, thinking about performing specific tasks like walking, grabbing objects etc. With proper training, he was able to cover the length of one and a half football fields across the various sessions he conducted.\n\nThibault says that the trial gave him and people like him hope that it is possible, even with their handicap.", "description": "Life can get really difficult for people recovering from paralysis.
