This past weekend, six English players did so, reportedly under order from English coach Eddie Jones.\n\nREAD MORE NRL Star Manase Fainu Charged Over Alleged Stabbing At Sydney Church\n\nThe fine is said to be reasonably small \u2013 only mid-four figures, and less than the $4,700-odd fine France was slugged with for pulling a similar Team Stand Too Close stunt prior to the 2011 World Cup Final.\n\nOf course, unlike the French effort, this one actually worked, with England getting an early upper hand and never relinquishing, turfing the All Blacks out of the World Cup and punching their ticket to a Final matchup against South Africa on Saturday.\n\nNews of the fine has been met with varied bemusement, given no one \u2013 not even the All Blacks \u2013 had much of a problem with England standing differently to begin with.\n\nYou simply gotta love a mostly pointless sporting decision. Someone sat down and thought that rule up. It\u2019s beautiful stuff.", "description": "England have been slugged with a small fine for standing a wee bit too close to the All Blacks during the haka at the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/hakafb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
