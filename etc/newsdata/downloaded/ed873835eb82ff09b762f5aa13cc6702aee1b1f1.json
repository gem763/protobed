General Assembly, but Rouhani held steadfast in refusing to even speak to Trump before sanctions have been lifted. Macron, for his part, has sought for month to mediate a deal between the two nations, despite Trump\u2019s objections.\n\n\u201cI know Emmanuel means well, as do all others, but nobody speaks for the United States but the United States itself. No one is authorized in any way, shape, or form, to represent us!\u201d Trump said on Twitter of the French president\u2019s attempts to mediate discussions with Iran in August.\n\nAccording to The Times, Macron \u201cblindsided\u201d the Iranian leader with an unannounced visit to his hotel near the United Nations in New York, where world leaders were gathered for the annual General Assembly. He awaited an answer outside Rouhani\u2019s suite. The telephone line had been set up; all Rouhani had to do was walk from his hotel suite to a secure room and accept the call.\n\nCommunicating through aides, Rouhani ultimately refused to come out of his room.\n\nNIGERIA POLICE RESCUE 19 YOUNG WOMEN, GIRLS FROM 'BABY FACTORY'\n\nWithout a guarantee Trump would end sanctions on Iran, Rouhani feared giving him any chance to exploit the interaction and brag of a success. Rouhani has been under pressure from hard-liners back home who outright condemn any possibility of a dialogue with the American president. Iran has been ramping up tensions with the U.S. as a result of Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign of sanctions.\n\nBORIS JOHNSON AIDE DENIES PRIME MINISTER COFFEE IN A DISPOSABLE CUP: YOU SHOULDN'T HOLD THAT'\n\nIran has repeatedly publicly promised it would not negotiate with the U.S. before sanctions were lifted, calling the sanctions \u201cmerciless economic terrorism.\u201d Trump and Macron\u2019s hypothesis that Rouhani may be a little softer in private proved inaccurate.\n\nMeanwhile Trump in his speech the same day blasted Iran\u2019s \u201cbloodlust\u201d and rising aggression. The U.S. has blamed Iran for recent attacks on Saudi oil fields, an accusation Iran has denied.\n\nWhen Rouhani sat down with Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace last week, he blamed Trump for damaging relations between the two countries by backing out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201c\"We had an agreement.
