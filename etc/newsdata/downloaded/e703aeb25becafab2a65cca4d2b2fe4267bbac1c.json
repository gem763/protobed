And I think that there is a concerted effort now to frustrate Brexit.\u201d\n\n\"I think that there is a concerted effort now to frustrate Brexit\" \u2014 Boris Johnson\n\nAsked if he was putting the Edwardes claim down to political motivation, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to impugn people\u2019s motives or to minimize the importance of the issue. All I can say is that that allegation is certainly not true.\"\n\nEdwardes, who made the allegation in a column in the Sunday Times, tweeted later Sunday that she stood by her story after the prime minister's spokesperson said it was untrue. \"If the prime minister doesn\u2019t recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does,\" she tweeted.", "description": "The prime minister said the claims could also be an attempt to distract from his domestic agenda.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Annabelle Dickson", "Jack Blanchard", "Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1172522011-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
