Brendan Rodgers remembers every detail of his daily commute as Liverpool manager and precisely where it all came to an end four years ago on Friday. There is not a trace of resentment as he recalls the sliding doors moment that steered him and Liverpool towards more successful futures apart, and J\u00fcrgen Klopp into that same Formby residence six weeks later.\n\n\u201cI was in the car and coming through Stockbridge Village when I got the call from [Fenway Sports Group president] Mike Gordon,\u201d says Rodgers, who marks the anniversary by taking his third-placed Leicester team to Anfield on Saturday. The Hillsborough memorial service in 2016 aside, it will be his first visit back to the club he managed for 40 months and 166 games since being dismissed after a 1-1 draw with Everton on 4 October 2015. The team coach had returned to Melwood from Goodison Park for players and staff to collect their cars. Moments later, Gordon dialled with the bullet.\n\nHarry who? How Leicester\u2019s defence thrived despite selling \u00a380m Maguire | Paul Doyle Read more\n\n\u201cPeople probably knew about it before me because I\u2019d been asked a couple of weeks before if the end was near,\u201d Rodgers says. \u201cI understood. Listen, the owners were brilliant for me. I really have to say that. I had many calls late at night with Mike and his enthusiasm and his hunger for the club to succeed was great.\n\n\u201cThe support they gave me as a young manager at a big club, and they were still learning as well \u2013 I think they realised later on that if you do need a centre-half or a goalkeeper you have to pay the money and get him in \u2013 they gave me everything. So when Mike rang it was OK. I thanked him for giving me the opportunity. I understood. It [the sack] maybe could have come in the summer. It didn\u2019t and we continued to work and when the owners decided to change that was just part of football.\u201d\n\nThat Sunday night Rodgers flew to Marbella on a planned vacation during the international break with his future wife Charlotte. His mood was not helped by several days of incessant rain in Spain nor when he was photographed asleep with his mouth wide open on the flight back by a fellow EasyJet passenger. The misery of losing his job did not, however, prevent Rodgers from helping his successor to settle on Merseyside by inviting Klopp and his wife Ulla to view the house they continue to rent from him.\n\n\u201cThe girls looked round the house while we had a cup of tea and a talk about football,\u201d says Klopp\u2019s landlord. \u201cWhat we said is private but he is a good guy with perspective on life. He has been great for the Premier League.\u201d Rodgers\u2019 tenant recalls: \u201cWe spoke mainly about the house. It was about six weeks after he left so I knew the team by then. He was not at all frustrated. He took it like a man.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brendan Rodgers has got the best out of Jamie Vardy this season, the striker has scored five league goals.

The 46-year-old from Carnlough returned to the Premier League as a winner in February having lifted every available domestic trophy during his time with Celtic before his acrimonious exit. But there is surely regret at how his work at Liverpool unravelled after he went closer than any manager in 24 years to bringing the league title to Anfield 17 months earlier?\n\nThe Leicester manager admits: \u201cYou can always think we could have been better or done things differently but it was just how it evolved. We had set an expectation that we could challenge but then we lost a world-class player and even though we were very much all about the team, Luis [Su\u00e1rez] was very much part of that.\n\n\u201cIt was like Tottenham losing Harry Kane. When you lose that type of player it makes it difficult for the rest of the squad and we didn\u2019t quite replace that. We created an identity in those first two seasons and then when we lost that press and aggression at the top of the pitch we didn\u2019t quite replace it.\n\nQuick guide Being: Brendan: the Liverpool years Show Hide 2012-13 Rodgers tells fans he\u2019ll \u201cleave no stone unturned in my quest. And that quest will be relentless.\u201d Fly-on-the-wall TV series Being:Liverpool later charts how he settled in during his first pre-season, with big speeches \u2013 \u201cI use a quote with the players, \u2018Per aspera ad astra\u2019, which is Latin for \u2018through adversity to the stars\u2019\u201d \u2013 and with his mind-games. Footage shows Rodgers telling the squad how he had written three names in sealed envelopes of players who will \u201clet us down this year \u2026 Make sure you are not in the envelope.\u201d They lose their first game 3-0. The series also visits his house, where viewers spot he has a giant portrait of himself hanging on the wall. Later that season Rodgers expands on his tactical approach, with a nod to a well-known pudding brand. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got the ball 65-70% of the time, it\u2019s a football death for the other team. It\u2019s death by football.\u201d They finish seventh. 2013-14\n\nAn emotional season ends with the Manager of the Year award, despite \u201cCrystanbul\u201d \u2013 losing a 3-0 lead, and the title, at Selhurst Park. \u201cWe just got carried away.\u201d 2014-15 Becomes the first Liverpool manager since the 1950s not to win a trophy after three seasons in charge. The season ends on a low: a 6-1 defeat to Stoke, and a sixth-place finish. \u201cI\u2019ve always said if the owners want me to go, I will go. But I still have a lot to offer them.\u201d The owners back him. 2015-16 Then they sack him, eight games into the new season. Insiders say Rodgers reacted to the news with \u201cincredible dignity\u201d, then offered to let his successor J\u00fcrgen Klopp move into his house. Rodgers: \u201cI told them, \u2018Listen, I\u2019m moving to London for a bit, so J\u00fcrgen can move in\u2019. And he did. I was never going to be bitter. I wanted him to succeed. I want the club to succeed.\u201d Photograph: R\u00e9gis Duvignau/X00095\n\n\u201cObviously the disappointment was not being able to sustain it but sometimes that\u2019s how it works out for you. You learn from that. We were in a similar situation here at Leicester in the summer. We lost one of our top players when Harry [Maguire] went to Manchester United but the experience back then helps me deal with this better. You know you have to do the best for the player and the club and if he ends up going then don\u2019t take it personally. You make sure the team is stronger for it. It maybe didn\u2019t work out for us back then but it helped me moving forward.\u201d\n\nAnd does he allow himself to think of what might have been but for that infamous slip-up against Chelsea during the 2013-14 title race? \u201cJust from time to time; I don\u2019t burden myself with it,\u201d Rodgers says. \u201cI believe we did everything we possibly could but fell short. We were second and had an opportunity to win but didn\u2019t take it \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that. Over the course of 38 games, if you don\u2019t win the league you don\u2019t deserve to win it. We have so many happy memories from that season. But do I think about it? Yes, from time to time it will come to me.\u201d\n\nRecruitment was a recurring problem during Rodgers\u2019 time at Liverpool, with the young, driven manager often at odds with the transfer committee that has worked so successfully alongside Klopp. And it is here, perhaps more than in any other facet of management, that Rodgers differs from the 39-year-old who walked into one of the biggest jobs in world football in 2012. FSG\u2019s restrictions on the age of transfer targets was one source of irritation for the former Liverpool manager, who wanted to exchange Jordan Henderson for Fulham\u2019s Clint Dempsey at the start of his tenure. Pushing for Christian Benteke, while appearing unsure how best to maximise the glorious gifts of Roberto Firmino, was another head-scratcher during Rodgers\u2019 reign. The conflict, he maintains, would not happen now.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\n\u201cWhat experience has given me is I\u2019m much more relaxed now on that front,\u201d he says of transfers. \u201cMy strengths are managing players and coaching players. As a modern manager at the top level it\u2019s very difficult to have the time to go out looking at players. I know what my strengths are, and when I come into a club I try to make it clear in terms of the type of game I want to play. Then you put your trust in your recruitment team and the club to get the players in.\n\n\u201cGoing back to Liverpool, I think it was a learning aspect. I was a young manager back then and the board were new to it as well. We had a strategy and that was how they worked and I was part of the process. You couldn\u2019t see whether it would work or not. But afterwards they knew they could spend on a senior player or a top goalkeeper, and of course that clearly helped, but you have to go through that process of learning.\u201d Everyone, it appears, is better for it.", "description": "Manager holds no grudges against his former side after Celtic success and now a promising start with a revitalised Leicester", "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7afd2f36d9163a30b674421172ec7f776fc3c5e2/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=83e8cc1457f2beffe6a403cc6e891d53", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
