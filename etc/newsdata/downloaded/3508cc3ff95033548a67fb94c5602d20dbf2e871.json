(DC Fire and EMS photo)\n\nEmployees evacuated the headquarters of the Internal Revenue Service in Washington on Friday, and firefighters marched in after a possible hazardous materials situation was reported there, according to the D.C. fire department.\n\nThe department said it responded around 10 a.m. to a possible problem with overheated storage batteries kept for backup use.\n\nWith the possibility that fumes might be generated, the imposing stone structure on Constitution Avenue NW was evacuated out of what the fire department called \u201can abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nRed emergency trucks parked on 10th Street NW. And, air tanks on their backs, red protective boots on their feet and their faces masked, hazmat specialists trooped into the building.
