When things come up, there\u2019s multiple things that we haven\u2019t talked about that have happened in our own country that we don\u2019t bring up. There\u2019s things that happen in my own community in trying to help my kids graduate high school and go off to college. That\u2019s been my main concern the last couple of years with my school,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday.\n\nJames often tweets about the work of his LeBron James Family Foundation.\n\nIn Hong Kong, protesters burned and stomped on James jerseys during a rally Tuesday at the Southorn Playground. They threw basketballs at a photo of James and chanted support for Morey and criticism about James\u2019 comments.\n\n\u201cLet me clear up the confusion,\u201d James tweeted Monday. \u201cI do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that. ... My team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.\u201d\n\nAmong the critics of James\u2019 comments Monday night was U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. The former Florida governor, who has been critical of James in the past dating to his decision to leave the Miami Heat in 2014, posted on Twitter that James \u201cis the one who isn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand. It\u2019s sad to see him join the chorus kowtowing to Communist China & putting profits over human rights.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Lebron James on Tuesday attempted to clarify his position after his critical remarks about Houston GM\u2019s Daryl Morey\u2019s pro-Hong Kong tweet was widely rebuked on social media and tried to explain that \"we're not politicians.\"", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
