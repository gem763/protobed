It\u2019s time may have finally come.\n\nDemographic shifts, progressive organizing efforts and President Donald Trump\u2019s potential weakness in the state appear to be providing Democrats in 2020 with their best shot at capturing the state since Bill Clinton won it more than two decades ago.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA new poll, commissioned by a state labor union and released today, shows Trump running neck-and-neck with Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden in theoretical match-ups.\n\nThat poll follows several other recent surveys with more bad news for Republicans. A late July survey \u2014 conducted by Trump\u2019s own pollster \u2014 showed the president losing to Biden, and another in August reported a tie. In Arizona\u2019s closely-watched 2020 U.S. Senate race, two of those polls show GOP Sen. Martha McSally in a tie and a third shows her trailing Democrat Mark Kelly.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are very concerned,\u201d said Chuck Coughlin, once a top aide to Republican Govs. Fife Symington and Jane Hull. \u201cThe ground is shifting.\u201d\n\nThe change has been gradually building for years as more Latinos, who tend to vote Democratic, have registered and voted in larger numbers.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s victory marked the first time Democrats have won an Arizona Senate seat since 1988; The party also picked up a handful of state legislative seats.\n\nTwo years earlier, Trump became the first GOP presidential nominee in 20 years to receive less than 50 percent of the vote.\n\nThe polling suggests the days of writing off Arizona as comfortably Republican could be ending.\n\nRepublicans point out that registered Republicans vastly outnumber Democrats in the state, Trump fires up the base like no other and the state continues to be a mecca for retirees, who tend to vote Republican.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s approval rating is underwater, with 45 percent of Arizona voters holding a favorable impression of him and 53 percent having an unfavorable view \u2014 the overwhelming majority of whom hold a \u201cvery unfavorable view,\u201d according to a survey of 520 Arizona registered voters by Bendixen & Amandi International. The firm, which typically surveys for Democrats and was paid to conduct this poll by SMART Local 359, the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers, conducted the poll from September 9-12.\n\nTrump is tied dead even with Warren at 42 percent in a general election match-up and is essentially tied with Biden 43-42 percent, a lead well within the poll\u2019s margin of error of plus/minus 4.3 points.\n\nMcSally is tied at 42 percent with Kelly, a former astronaut and husband of former Arizona Congresswoman and mass-shooting survivor Gabby Giffords.\n\n\u201cContrary to the conventional wisdom that the presidential race is down to only four swing states \u2014 Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida \u2014 this poll makes it clear that Arizona is wide open,\u201d said pollster Fernand Amandi. \u201cArizona is emerging as the new battleground.\u201d\n\nSen. Martha McSally. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nAmandi\u2019s numbers are in line with a poll from OH Predictive Insights, a non-partisan Arizona consulting company that conducted a survey last month showing Biden at 45 percent and Trump at 43 percent. Warren, too, was basically tied with Trump, who had 44 percent to her 43 percent. Both Amandi\u2019s poll and OH Predictive\u2019s found that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and other candidates fared more poorly against Trump. OH Predictive, showed Kelly leading McSally by 46 percent to 41 percent in the Senate race.\n\nIn late July, Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio surveyed Arizona on behalf of the AARP and found Biden leading Trump, 50 percent to 45 percent. That poll had an error margin of 4 percent and found a statistical tie in the Senate contest.\n\nOne quirk in the Senate race weighing on McSally: She\u2019s fresh off a bitter 2018 Senate race loss to Sinema, who has higher favorability ratings. McSally was later appointed to fill the seat held by Sen. John McCain following his death and the resignation of his successor, Jon Kyl, in 2019.\n\nIn the Democratic presidential primary, Amandi\u2019s poll shows Biden with a slight lead over Warren, with the former vice president at 29 percent and the Massachusetts senator at 24 percent. Sanders trails with 18 percent, followed by a host of other Democrats who are polling in the single digits.\n\n\u201cWhat this poll of Arizona and what other polling across the country is suggesting is the Democratic primary is becoming a two-person race,\u201d Amandi said.\n\nAs in other swing states and battlegrounds, however, political insiders wonder if Warren\u2019s politics are too progressive to ultimately carry Arizona and its 11 Electoral College votes. And regardless of who the Democratic nominee is, Republicans expect their base will come home to Trump as he unloads his substantial war chest on whomever he faces in the general election.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s numbers with independents are terrible right now. But we know what Trump is going to do to the Democratic nominee. Trump knows his universe of voters,\u201d Coughlin said.\n\nSean Noble, who advised Republican Gov. Doug Ducey\u2019s successful campaign, said he believes that the recent polls could be off because people are lying to pollsters and the surveys won\u2019t be able to easily estimate the composition of the electorate because turnout will likely be at record highs.\n\nNoble said tens of thousands of Republicans and conservatives didn\u2019t vote in 2016 for Trump, but he has brought them home in Arizona thanks to his conservative record of cutting regulations and appointing conservative judges. He said that should benefit McSally as well.\n\n\u201cTrump will carry McSally,\u201d Noble predicted.\n\nChris Baker, a Republican political consultant from Arizona, said he believes the \u201cpolling is more a reflection of Trump's flavor of the day \u2014 it will change. My guess is things will stabilize in the presidential race.\u201d\n\nAs for the Senate race, Baker said, he sees an even tighter race in this political environment.\n\n\u201cWith independent voters, their eyes are wondering,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWith Democratic voters, there\u2019s a lot of intensity. But there\u2019s a lot of intensity on the right as well.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Democrats appear to have their best shot at capturing the state since Bill Clinton won it more than two decades ago.", "authors": ["Marc Caputo"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/09/13/ebdda4554475ad4259246c3fcaed/190917-sinema-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
