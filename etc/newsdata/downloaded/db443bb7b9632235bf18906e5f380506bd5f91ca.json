They\u2019re very long.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol, which performed the airlift rescue, said it had never before extracted anyone from a life-threatening situation after being alerted to their plight by a message in a bottle.\n\n\u201cA lot of pieces fell into place just right for these folks,\u201d said Joe Kingman, the helicopter pilot who found the family.\n\nThe astonishing episode started as Mr Whitson, a self-employed door repairman, hiked down the Arroyo Seco tributary with son Hunter and partner Krystal Ramirez, a bartender.\n\nRead more\n\nAt the top of the 40-foot waterfall, they had expected a rope to assist hikers descend the treacherous drop \u2013 but it had broken away. There was no way down. Looking up the gorge they had penetrated to this point, they realised there was also no way to climb back up and out. Their phones had zero reception.\n\n\u201cIt was a little scary,\u201d said Hunter with apparent understatement. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen a single soul the entire trip.\u201d\n\nSo, Mr Whitson tried his water bottle trick.\n\nHe scratched \u201cHELP!\u201d on each side, scribbled the SOS note \u2013 \u201cWE ARE STUCK HERE @ THE WATERFALL GET HELP PLEASE\u201d \u2013 and signed off with the date before tucking it inside the bottle and throwing it over the rocks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done all we can do,\u201d he recalled saying. \u201cThe only thing left to do now is wait.\u201d\n\nThey did not have to do so for very long.\n\nWithin hours, at about midnight, the trio were woken by a helicopter and voice from a loudspeaker: \u201cThis is search and rescue \u2013 you have been found. Stay put and we\u2019ll be back to get you tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\nTwo hikers a quarter of a mile downstream had, it turned out, spotted the bright green bottle, read the note and headed to the Arroyo Seco Campground to alert emergency workers.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds\n\nAlthough it was quickly growing too dark for a rescue operation, California Highway Patrol helicopter pilot Todd Brethour decided to do a flyover with his crew before the end of their shift.\n\nUsing night vision goggles and infrared technology to detect heat from a campfire, they were able to spot the stranded trio and alert them they had been found.\n\nThe next morning, 16 June, a second helicopter crew arrived at 10am to air lift them to safety.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Jet skiers rescue 100 people trapped by floods after Hurricane Dorian", "description": "It was a desperate act of hope by a father fearing he had brought his family into mortal peril.When Curtis Whitson found himself, his partner and his 13-year-old son trapped atop an isolated 40-foot waterfall in California, his only solution for possible escape was a plan he did not dare dream could", "authors": ["Colin Drury"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zJfyyBijllPTiOH_VJRz0Q--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/a8a4b1fb3bb388bbda6299752e22fa0b", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
