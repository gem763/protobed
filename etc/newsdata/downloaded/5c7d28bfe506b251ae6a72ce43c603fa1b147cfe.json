Parts of the Middle East were much wetter than average with heavy rain leading to flash flooding in the region.\n\nIran under water\n\nThree straight weeks of rainfall submerged much of Iran. The province of Golestan in the north-east of the country received 70% of its average annual rainfall in one day and dams are currently reported to be 95 percent full raising fears of further flooding.\n\nEast Africa floods\n\nTropical cyclone Idai also brought devastating floods to Eastern Africa causing large-scale loss of life. It's estimated at least nearly 850 people died. Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe were all badly hit by the storm as was Madagascar.\n\nState of global glaciers\n\nExperts estimate melting glaciers have lost more than 22 meters in ice thickness since 1960. Last week scientists announced that the ice loss from glaciers over the past decade accounts for up to 30% of the observed sea-level rise.", "description": "Last month was the second warmest March ever as worldwide temperatures continue to rise.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/77/23/16/1000x563_cmsv2_8c3668d3-8a8c-572a-9056-b8e7e2260eaa-3772316.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-15"}
