Irony: It\u2019s being called \u201cThe Equality Act.\u201d\n\nThere are reasons sports are separated by sex; and one of those is the fact that men, generally, are bigger, faster, and stronger.\n\nHere\u2019s more on that from Joe Rogan:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we make the distinction to have male athletics vs. female athletics. The reason is that males have a physiological advantage over women. \u2026 [I]f you\u2019re a women, and you\u2019re a natural woman, and you don\u2019t take any extra hormones or male hormones, you\u2019re not taking steroids or any sort of performance-enhancing drugs, you\u2019re doing your very best to compete and you\u2019re at the top of the heap, and someone comes along and they were a man for 30 years, and decides they\u2019re going to be a woman\u2026and competes as a woman and destroys records and dominates you in that sport, that\u2019s bull****. \u2026 That\u2019s a person who is biologically a male, and who was a male for 30+ years of having testosterone run through their body and affect their tendon strength, and affect the shape of their bones and the mechanical advantages of the male hips vs. the female hips, and then they\u2019re competing with smaller people who have been a woman their whole life. It\u2019s not fair. It is as much cheating as taking steroids when the other person doesn\u2019t or taking performance-enhancing drugs when the other person doesn\u2019t. Maybe even more so. Maybe even more so, because you also have \u2014 there\u2019s a bunch of advantages in terms of reaction time that males enjoy. It\u2019s some significant difference in reaction time between males and even untrained males vs. female professional athletes.\u201d\n\nSomewhere right now is a girl with athletic dreams. She\u2019s destined to make all-stars. And all-state. To set records in high school. And get a scholarship. And break records in college. And get national recognition. And go to the Olympics. And get compete professionally. And parlay all the attention into endorsements or other means of making a living. Or any one or combination of those.\n\nBut she won\u2019t \u2014 because a man is going to take her place.\n\nWhy are there people voicing support for it?\n\nThis is anecdotal, but I believe it\u2019s worth a watch: A video of the weekend\u2019s co-ed World Athletics Championships surfaced Tuesday, showing four different male track runners pass a woman who\u2019d been given a 7-second head start for a short run. In the 4\u00d7400-meter relay, each team was comprised of two men and two women.\n\nThe extraordinary events of the mixed relay at the World Athletics Championships around an hour ago. Watch four men give a woman a 7-second head start over just 400m and cruise past her. pic.twitter.com/nAf9Oe3vtj \u2014 Wings Over Scotland (@WingsScotland) September 29, 2019\n\nThis is where we\u2019re headed. Dudes\u2019ll blow out chicks, and that\u2019ll be that for their hopes and dreams.\n\nCheck out the videos.\n\nHere's the short version of what it's like for female athletes to compete against biological males. pic.twitter.com/ll0ukegwYT \u2014 Wings Over Scotland (@WingsScotland) September 29, 2019\n\nAnd for a wrap-up, here\u2019s more Joe:\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with being open-minded or tolerant. It has something to do with logic; just basic reason. This is craziness. You\u2019re encouraging people to be something that\u2019s preposterous. \u2026 You\u2019re in make-believe town. \u2026 You can\u2019t just decide you\u2019re a woman and compete with women. That\u2019s make-believe. \u2026 You\u2026know there\u2019s an advantage. Everyone knows. This is crazy. \u2026 I\u2019m as open-minded as they come with this, but this is unfair for women \u2014 which is what\u2019s so ironic about this, because everybody\u2019s supposed to be looking out for women. If you\u2019re looking out for women but you\u2019re also blindly progressive to the point where you\u2019re letting [stuff] like this fly, well, then you\u2019re not looking out for women, because women are now in this weird position where you\u2019re putting them at this unfair disadvantage. It\u2019s\u2026crazy. It\u2019s a symptom of a sick society. It\u2019s a symptom of a lack of rational thinking. It\u2019s people just bending over backward so hard to be progressive and open-minded that you\u2019re giving into these extremists, these crazy people that are looking at this thing completely delusionally.\u201d\n\nAs reported by The Telegraph, the WAC 4\u00d7400-meter relay was \u201ctrack athletics\u2019 first mixed-gender event.\u201d\n\nOnly officially \u2014 see here and here.\n\n-ALEX\n\nP.S.
