Now she's planning a funeral.\" Karen hopes the money will be used to move the family closer to their relatives, as well as helping to provide for them in the short term.\n\nShe said: \"We're just asking for help. We're not going to sit on a pile of money. It's going to buy the children clothes and school uniforms.\n\n\"In reality, people think about the immediate, but the actual reality of this is it's going to be long-term, having six children. They weren't well off, they lived hand to mouth. It really is just heartbreaking.\"\n\nKaren added: \"Finding yourself in a family, it's hard enough with the pair of you raising six children.\n\n\"We just can't put it into words. It's like it's not happening. Ben was all about his children. He had raised them from birth.\n\n\"We want to do the best for Ben. Wherever he is, we want him to know we're going to look after them.\"\n\nThe Justgiving page has so far raised more than \u00a32,300, exceeding the fundraiser's target of \u00a32,000.\n\nMembers of the public have also paid for a months' worth of groceries for the family.\n\nYou can donate here .", "description": "Ben Johnson's sudden death in Norfolk has left his young family heartbroken and struggling to get by", "authors": ["Martyn Halle", "Image", "Bpm Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20589589.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195970160.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
