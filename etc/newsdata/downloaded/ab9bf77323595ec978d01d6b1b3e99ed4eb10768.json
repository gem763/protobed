(http://bit.ly/2IlMmo5)\n\nThe agency last month urged people to not use e-cigarettes with marijuana ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), saying that the high-inducing component may have a role in causing the illness.\n\nHere's what we know about the vaping-related deaths so far:\n\n** States that have reported deaths: Alabama, California (2), Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas (2), Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Oregon (2), Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.\n\n** Nearly 70% of the 889 patients, on whom data is available, are male, with 16% below 18 years of age, according to the CDC.\n\n** Data shows all reported patients have a history of e-cigarette use or vaping.\n\n** Patients have reported symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath or chest pain, as well as nausea or diarrhea, according to the CDC.\n\n** Washington governor Jay Inslee last month urged state agencies to ban flavored and cannabis-derived vaping products and said more stringent rules could follow.\n\n** Massachusetts has imposed a four-month ban on sales of all vaping products, including those used for marijuana, which is legal in the state.\n\n** Several vape shop owners have sued Massachusetts, asking the court to deem the ban \"unconstitutional.\"\n\n** A federal judge last week denied the industry's bid to put a hold on Massachusetts' four-month ban, saying a temporary restraining order on the ban would conflict with the public interest.\n\n** New York state, Michigan and Rhode Island have all banned the sale of flavored vaping products.\n\n** Kroger Co, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Walmart Inc have said they would stop selling e-cigarettes at their stores.
