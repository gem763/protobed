In this, at least, Beijing is correct. It knows what many Hong Kongers don\u2019t seem to have fully appreciated: Admit it or not, we are actually rejecting Chinese sovereignty \u2014 we are already an independence movement in disguise. And it all started with the Umbrella Movement.\n\nIn their notorious 8/31 white paper, the Chinese authorities in Beijing put forward that they had \u5168\u9762\u7ba1\u6cbb\u6b0a over Hong Kong, roughly: the \u201call-inclusive power to govern, no holds barred.\u201d The autonomy enjoyed by the special administrative region is not a given; it is given, or granted, by Beijing. Being told this angered many Hong Kongers, especially those longing for universal suffrage and those who had expected China to act as a responsible ruler and keep the promises it made, including in the Basic Law, for years to come. They saw Beijing\u2019s declaration as an undue attempt to expand its power over Hong Kong, and they made a counter-declaration, in effect, setting out an entirely different vision for the city\u2019s future.\n\nSep. 28, 2014 is now seen as the day that officially marks the beginning of the Umbrella Movement, and what happened on that day is that a bunch of people who opposed Beijing\u2019s plans for Hong Kong, many of them students, rushed out the city\u2019s main roads, bypassing the adults\u2019 and elites\u2019 own plans, and began occupying the streets in protest. Although they weren\u2019t calling for Hong Kong\u2019s independence then, they already were, perhaps without realizing it, rejecting the Beijing Consensus.\n\nThe Umbrella Movement also contained the political DNA of today\u2019s next-generation protesters. It, too, had factions, internal struggles and disagreements over tactics. Benny Tai Yiu-ting, an academic who had been advocating a kind of Occupy operation in Central, a business district, was forced to accept a modified version of his own idea after supporters of the student leader Joshua Wong scaled the gates of the Legislative Council in Admiralty, triggering the police crackdown that really kick-started the movement.\n\nIn the course of the 79-day occupation that followed, the sit-in in Admiralty turned into something like a village of mostly young people and adults acting as chaperones of sorts. (A tented library was set up so that students could cram for exams.) But there was a second power center: the camps in Mong Kok, a working-class area, which gathered an older and more mixed crowd. Already back then, the protests\u2019 metabolism ran on decentralization.\n\nThe Umbrella Movement was also the initial stage of the \u201cdo not split\u201d ethos that binds protesters together today: If you disagree with a proposed action, sit it out, but don\u2019t get in its way. Protesters got used to there being different modes of action in 2014, and that paved the way for an even more flexible, pragmatic approach that people follow now.\n\nThere were divergences of views between, say, Benny Tai and Joshua Wong and between the protesters in Admiralty and those in Mong Kok, but everyone was in the same fight together, on the side of democracy. Five years later, the notion that this cohesion, built around our aspirations and identity, extends beyond our differences has only grown stronger. And so has our hunger for self-determination. Even the people who aren\u2019t calling for outright independence are part of an independence movement. The Umbrella Movement was the first battle in the clash of Chinese civilization.\n\nLewis Lau Yiu-man is a contributor to Stand News in Hong Kong and Up Media in Taiwan.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
