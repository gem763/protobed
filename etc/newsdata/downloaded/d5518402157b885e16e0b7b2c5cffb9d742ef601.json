And ever since then, various prime ministers and members of Parliament have been struggling with how best to do that amid rancorous disagreements among the political parties.\n\nThe risk of a no-deal departure increased under Johnson, who threatened to leave the EU on Oct. 31, regardless of whether an agreement was reached, and the British government prepared the six-page classified document to prepare for potential problems under that scenario.\n\nSo just how bad could a no-deal Brexit be for Britain?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the \"Operation Yellowhammer\" document, the British government has identified serious risks including: Significant traveling issues, serious trade route disruptions (e.g., the main freight route would have a greatly reduced flow rate of as little as 40 percent within one day), a diminished supply of important medicines and food and problems with the open Ireland/Northern Ireland border, which was the subject of violent conflicts for decades.\n\nAt one point, the document specifically expresses apprehension about significant protests and public disorder.\n\nThose risks may have declined this month: On Sept. 4, Parliament passed a law that requires the prime minister to request a Brexit postponement if he and Parliament can't reach an agreement on future relations with the EU.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to reporting of this story.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Brexit could mean hard times for Britain: \"Operation Yellowhammer\".", "authors": ["Christian De La Chapelle"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/boris.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
