But, in his new role as president of ESPN, he, along with Kevin Mayer, who was elevated direct-to-consumer and international chairman around the same time, would ultimately be responsible for the service's success or failure.\n\nThe standalone subscription was Disney's first big bet on the future of TV beyond linear TV. It set the stage for the forthcoming launch of Disney Plus and Disney's bid for control of Hulu.\n\n\"We had a lot of pressure on us to make sure that we had the breadth of content that we believe represented ESPN,\" Pitaro said in a conversation with the ESPN anchor Hannah Storm at the Paley Center for Media on Thursday. \"To be honest, there wasn't a ton available ... We had a lot of it already for the traditional side of our business.\"\n\nProtecting ESPN's cable business was as important as getting the new streaming service off the ground.\n\nPitaro didn't want to cannibalize ESPN's cable channels by launching the streaming service, so those rights were off the table. The service was meant to complement the programming already airing on ESPN.\n\nDisney's media networks, as a whole, were responsible for 42% of the company's $15.7 billion in operating income in 2018, and 46% in 2017. The company doesn't break out ESPN's financials.\n\nBut ESPN was estimated to have generated $9.9 billion in operating revenue in 2018, 3% up from the year before, by Kagan, a media-research group within S&P Global Market Intelligence. Three-quarters of that operating revenue came from the fees distributors like Comcast pay to carry ESPN, which is estimated to be far and away the most expensive channel in the cable bundle.\n\n\"We want to be careful not to fix one problem and create another,\" Pitaro said. \"We say, we have to protect the core.\"\n\nESPN Plus launched in April 2018 with a smattering of sports, including collections of regular season baseball, hockey, and soccer games, as well as boxing and tennis matches, golf events, and college sports. Pitaro credits Burke Magnus, the head of programming and scheduling, and the rights-acquisition team with landing those deals.\n\nESPN is weaving the streaming service into all its rights negotiations.\n\nThe team is now programming for ESPN's TV networks and the subscription-video app simultaneously.\n\n\"Every deal that we're negotiating right now, we're focused on including an ESPN Plus component,\" Pitaro said.\n\nDisney signed a deal in May 2018 with UFC to bring the fight sport to both ESPN cable channels and ESPN Plus. The deal was valued at around $300 million per year for five years, according to The Guardian.\n\nCombat sports were key for ESPN Plus, Pitaro said, because they have an obsessive young fanbase.\n\n\"We thought, in a world where there's so much churn in general because there's so many opportunities \u2014 again, infinite choices \u2014 we have this younger, passionate, diverse audience that we can bring in to ESPN Plus,\" Pitaro said. \"Made a ton of sense for us.\"\n\nESPN has also been using platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok to help its on-air talent connect with younger fans, like influencers, build relationships with their audiences on those platforms.\n\nIt's unclear whether ESPN Plus will live up to the legacy of ESPN.\n\nAs of June, a little over a year after ESPN Plus launched, the service had 2.4 million subscribers. Time will tell whether it can ever live up to the legacy of ESPN.\n\nDisney's direct-to-consumer and international business posted a $553 million operating loss that period, more than three times the loss reported a year earlier. But that also included investment costs tied to the launch of Disney Plus this coming November.\n\nDisney's distribution machine will be key to competing with Amazon and others for sports rights, Pitaro said.\n\nMoving forward, Pitaro said Disney's massive distribution machine would be key to helping it compete for rights against cash-rich tech companies like Amazon and Facebook, who have been vying for the streaming rights to the NFL, MLB, and other matchups recently, on top of sports broadcasters from CBS, Fox, NBCUniversal, and WarnerMedia's Turner.\n\nDisney aired two broadcasts on the NFL draft this year, for instance. One aired on ESPN and one was on ABC. \"The NFL said to us, what's most important to us is expanding our audience,\" Pitaro said. The ESPN broadcast analyzed the player moves, and ABC went for viewers' heartstrings, interviewing parents of the players and uncovering their backstories.\n\nDisney also opened an NBA Experience at Disney Springs, part of Disney World, in August. \"How many of our competitors can bring the theme parks to the table?\" Pitaro said. (Comcast's NBCUniversal also operates theme parks.)\n\nIn the end, Pitaro thinks the rights negotiations will come down to Disney's relationships with the leagues, reach, and production value.\n\n\"You have to ask a lead commissioner whether they'd be willing to take less money for better production, etc.,\" Pitaro said. \"But it also has to do with reach, scale ... I very much like our hand.\"", "description": "ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro opened up at the Paley Center on Thursday about ESPN Plus and the competition for sports rights from Amazon and others.", "authors": ["Ashley Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7a87f22e22af240b5c71b3-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
