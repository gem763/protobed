Although Osaka has found plenty of endorsement opportunities from Japanese companies, her decision isn\u2019t linked to money, her mother said.\n\n\u201cWe made the decision that Naomi would represent Japan at an early age,\u201d Tamaki Osaka told the Wall Street Journal a year ago. \u201cShe was born in Osaka and was brought up in a household of Japanese and Haitian culture. Quite simply, Naomi and her sister Mari have always felt Japanese, so that was our only rationale. It was never a financially motivated decision nor were we ever swayed either way by any national federation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOsaka has faced prejudice in Japan, where there have been bullying incidents involving \u201chaafu,\u201d or half-Japanese people. She recently was declared to be \u201ctoo sunburned\u201d by two Japanese comedians who said she \u201cneeded some bleach.\u201d Osaka\u2019s response was to tout one of her sponsors, the Japanese cosmetics company Shiseido.\n\nAD\n\nLast winter, the Japanese noodle company Nissin acknowledged \u201cwhitewashing\u201d Osaka in an ad that was taken down after a public outcry.\n\nRead more on the Olympics from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "The 2018 U.S. Open champion must give up her dual citizenship under Japanese law before her 22nd birthday.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0syEorC2m21aAm-HSLSGT9dpO-M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IDS4MMXLKAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
