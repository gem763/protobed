A rash of injuries at the position in 2015 led to the use of four quarterbacks, who combined for 29 interceptions and a 3-9 record for coach Randy Edsall.\n\nPigrome was one of four quarterbacks to see action in 2016, and his 2017 season ended when he tore his ACL in the opener. Two weeks later, Kasim Hill tore his ACL, too.\n\nLast year, Pigrome assumed the starting job after Hill tore his other ACL. That was enough for Hill, who transferred to Tennessee this past August.\n\nPigrome stuck it out, and now he\u2019s poised to lead Maryland (3-2, 1-1 Big Ten) at Purdue (1-4, 0-2). Given that he\u2019s been a big part of the quarterback shuffle over the years, he could have guessed this was going to happen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad history,\u201d Pigrome conceded. \u201cBut I never looked at it like that. I just look at it as, when the opportunity comes, take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nPigrome has played in 28 career games, starting four. His finest moment came last November, when he threw for a career-high 181 yards and a touchdown in a 52-51 overtime loss to then-No.3 Ohio State.\n\nAfter Jackson prevailed in a tight duel for the starting job, Pigrome didn\u2019t complain or sulk. He simply made sure he was prepared to make the ascent if the time came for him to take over.\n\nSure enough, here it is.\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s the worst way to get a job, you have to do it for the team,\u201d Pigrome said.\n\nHis patience and determination as the backup made an impression Locksley, who in 2015 was the frazzled offensive coordinator of that infamous team that employed a linebacker at quarterback.\n\n\u201cYou have to be ready when your opportunity comes.,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen Piggy\u2019s maturation, in terms of preparing as if he\u2019s going to play, preparing as if he\u2019s the starter and not necessarily wallowing in being the backup.\u201d\n\nAfter Jackson left the Rutgers game shortly before halftime, Pigrome finished by going 13 for 18 for 111 yards with 22 yards rushing. Although Jackson has a slightly better arm, Pigrome\u2019s ability to escape a rush and improvise in the pocket is an asset the Terps intend to utilize.\n\n\u201cPiggy brings a different element because of his ability to make plays with his feet,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWhen things break down, you probably won\u2019t see him take as many sacks because of his ability to take off with the ball.\u201d\n\nLocksley said Jackson was day-to-day, and didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of him suiting up on Saturday. That\u2019s unlikely, which would make redshirt freshman Tyler DeSue the backup quarterback.\n\nThe Terrapins can only hope DeSue remains on the sideline, but nothing is certain at that position at this school.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The quarterback carousel at Maryland is back in motion, with Tyrrell Pigrome on board for the fourth year in a row.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/Maryland_Quarterbacks_Football_23900.jpg-422ef_c0-0-5125-2988_s1770x1032.jpg?dbab12522b43c541058cce1e7683ed1a75d53978", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
