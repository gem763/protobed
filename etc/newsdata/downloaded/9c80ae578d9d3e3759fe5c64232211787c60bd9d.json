Pictured: Krishnamoorthi (center) speaks alongside Rep Peter King (left), R-NY, and other Representatives at a press conference on stopping youth vaping, September 2019\n\nSeveral countries around the world have nicotine caps, including the UK, Israel and the European Union.\n\nSupporters of e-cigarette companies like JUUL say the pods help smokers transition from traditional cigarettes.\n\nBut critics say the pods are highly addictive and that high nicotine concentrations are partly responsible for the rising rates of teen vapers.\n\nE-cigarettes are currently the most used tobacco product among US teens.\n\nThe 2016 Surgeon General's report found a 900 percent increase in e-cigarette use among young people from 2011 to 2015.\n\nIn September, a report from FDA found that 27.5 percent of high school students are using e-cigarettes in 2019.\n\n'As a concerned parent, I am committed to preventing a new generation of nicotine addicts,' Krishnamoorthi, the chairman of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, said in a statement.\n\n'Capping the concentration of nicotine in e-cigarettes is integral to ending the youth vaping epidemic by making these products less addictive, less appealing to youth, and less harmful to public health.\n\nIt comes on the heels of an investigation into a slew of breathing illnesses related to vaping across the country\n\nThere have been 1,080 cases reported in mostly teens and young adults in 48 states, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released on Thursday.\n\nAt least 20 deaths, which have been suspected to be linked to vaping, have been reported in 17 states: Alabama, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Virginia.\n\nIn response, several states have temporarily restricted or banned flavored tobacco products.\n\nIn September 2019, Michigan became the first state to ban all flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol.\n\nNew York and Rhode Island quickly followed suit, and Washington State's ban is set to take effect later this month.\n\nMeanwhile Massachusetts has gone the farthest, issuing a four-month ban on all vaping products - flavored or not.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also announced his administration's plans to ban flavored vaping products nationwide.", "description": "US Rep Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) introduced a bill on Monday that would allow no more than\u00a020 milligrams per milliliter in the liquid pods that are used in e-cigarettes.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/22/19413540-0-image-a-31_1570482465321.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
