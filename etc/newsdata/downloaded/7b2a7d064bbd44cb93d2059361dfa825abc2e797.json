However, this has not been confirmed by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority.\n\nA dog in neighbouring Sweden has also been admitted to veterinary hospital after appearing at a show in the Norwegian city of Trondheim, according to Swedish newspaper GT.\n\nThe Norwegian Veterinary Institute said its pathologists found that three dogs showed signs of a bloody gut, and that it had ruled out common causes like salmonella and rat poison.\n\nFood safety authority spokesman Ole-Herman Tronerud told NRK that the illness seemed \"very serious for a dog. But we don't know yet whether this is contagious or just a series of individual cases\".\n\nThe agency has advised dog owners to keep animals on a lead in order to avoid contact with other canines.", "description": "Norwegian authorities said up to 40 dogs had fallen ill with vomiting in at least 13 towns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8152/production/_108660133_hi056258017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
