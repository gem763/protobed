So far four arrests have been made.\n\nProtestors arrived en masse at the east London station this morning and unfurled a banner reading 'business as usual = death'. At least two scaled a train as it watied to depart sparking violent fury from commuters.\n\nA video shows a bearded middle-aged man walking on top of the train as a crush of commuters jeer at him to get down. One throws a cup of coffee over the protestor and then several men drag him off the carriage to the platform.\n\nOnce he hits the ground a baying mob surrounds him and commuters seem to be caught on camera kicking and attacking the man before a London Underground employee steps in.\n\nMahatir Pasha, who filmed the video at Canning Town, told GMB: 'When I was there it was absolutely shocking scenes. I didn't expect to see anything like it.\n\n'We heard a big thud on top of the train. The driver made a short announcement. One like I've never heard before: 'Hey what are you doing', and the line cut off.\n\n'I saw two men standing on the train. They pulled out a banner. They said something along the lines of 'We're all going to die'.\n\nShe said the police arrived quickly once things 'got violent' and said a TFL member of staff 'did his absolute utmost' to protect commuters.\n\nThis morning commuters at Canning Town station reacted furiously to an XR protestor climbing on top of their train\n\nHe was dragged off the roof of the carriage after commuters boosted one of their number so he could reach the man's foot\n\nA protestor is dragged off the roof of a DLR train at Canning Town by a crowd of furious east London commuters\n\nOnce the protestor hit the platform amid the crush of bodies several men look seme to be caught on camera punching and kicking in the man's direction. Several pairs of hands are thrown into the air in applause further down the platform\n\nShe said that one of the commuters shouted: 'Look I'm just trying to get to work and feed my kids.'\n\nMs Pasha went on: 'A lot of commuters would have been working class trying to make their daily bread. I find it ironic they are coming from middle class educated backgrounds.'\n\nOne female protestor who glued herself to a train at Shadwell DLR station said she took the action in east London because the trains were 'heading for the City which is the God of our time'. She said the world was 'crucifying itself' for economic growth.\n\nCimate activist Phil Kingston, an 83-year-old repeat protestor, said he had glued himself to a train for the sake of his grandchildren. Today's will be his 13th arrest this year.\n\nIn addition to Canning Town Extinction Rebellion activists are protesting at a number of east London stations.\n\nExtinction Rebellion targeted three east London stations\n\nThe group's legal bid to overturn the order is expected to reach the High Court on Thursday afternoon, and they argue that it is an 'unprecedented and disproportionate curtailment' of the right to free speech and free assembly.\n\nThe local MP reacted angrily to Thursday's travel disruption.\n\nJim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, asked: 'So what point is Extinction Rebellion making shutting down east London's public transport system, preventing ordinary people from getting to work, school, hospital?'\n\nExtinction Rebellion co-founder Clare Farrell defended the Tube action and said: 'The public, I don't think, realise quite how serious this situation is.'\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she added: 'It is still peaceful, and it is still non-violent.\n\n'People did a similar action in April on the DLR train, those people were safe.\n\n'It makes them vulnerable, and that's what people are there to do when they put their body on the line.\n\n'There is a vast vulnerability that people have in the face of climate and ecological emergency.'\n\nAnd on LBC radio XR spokesperson Fergal McEntree admitted this morning's demos were a 'huge own goal'.\n\nThe British Transport Police said in a statement: 'Shortly after 7am this morning British Transport Police were called to simultaneous action by Extinction Rebellion at Stratford, Canning Town and Shadwell.\n\n'Protesters had dangerously obstructed Jubilee Line and DLR services by either climbing on top of services or by gluing themselves to the trains.\n\n'Four arrests have been made in connection to the Stratford and Canning Town incidents, with those detained being taken to police custody. Specialist Protest Removal Teams remain at Shadwell station, and are working to resume services as soon as possible.\n\n'We continue to urge protesters to not target the London Underground network. This is dangerous, not only for protesters but for commuters.\n\n'We have increased our patrols on the London Underground and at other rail hubs throughout London.'\n\nSadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, who until now has cautiously backed XR' and their right to protest, said in a statement: 'I strongly condemn the Extinction Rebellion protesters who have targeted the London Underground and DLR this morning.\n\n'This illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work.\n\n'It is also an unfair burden on our already overstretched police officers. I urge demonstrators to protest peacefully and within the boundaries of the law.'\n\nThis morning at Canning Town station in east London, XR protestors got on top of the public transport system\n\nHanging up a large sign which said 'Business as usual = Death' in front of weary commuters an XR protestors tried to speak\n\nThe eco-activist group has now said its members will protest 'mischievously' at Gatwick airport from 11am, promising 'musicians, clowns and singers.'\n\n\n\nPosting on group messaging app, one member urged others to 'come incognito' and then 'reveal yourself' after a signal is given adding 'musicians, clowns and singers' would be welcome and that 'some people may like to indulge in a bit of mischief'.\n\nThe post read: 'We're going on a trip to Gatwick Airport! With a light-hearted, informative vibe, lets give a wake-up call (again) about the urgent need to reduce the number of flights, not expand airports.\n\n'We call on passengers and friends to join us in tackling the Climate and Ecological Emergency.\n\n'They have the opportunity to contribute to safeguarding our future by limiting air travel to just essential journeys. Let's make them welcome.\n\n'Come incognito and await the signal at 11am to reveal yourself!\n\n'Performers, musicians, clowns, singers, party hats welcome. We will be handing out leaflets encouraging people to play their part in what lies ahead.\n\n'If inclined, some people may like to indulge in a bit of mischief but the intention is not to cause people to miss flights. Fun and imagination welcome.\n\n'Though we can't know what line the police or airport staff will take, so far as we know there is nothing in what we have outlined that would be against airport byelaws.'\n\nIn a statement Sussex Police said: 'We have been made aware of a proposed protest at Gatwick Airport on Thursday.\n\n'We are working with Gatwick Airport Limited. High visibility patrols will be present to support the airport in facilitating a peaceful protest, minimise the disruption for passengers and staff, and ensure a safe and secure environment.\n\n'We will balance the rights of all involved and will respond proportionately should this become a policing matter. We have been in communication with the organisers.'\n\nGuardian writer George Monbiot is taken away by police at the demo, after writing a column on why he hoped to be arrested\n\nIt comes after police moved in yesterday when Extinction Rebellion activists flooded Trafalgar Square and breastfeeding mothers staged a sit-in outside Google's London HQ.\n\nHundreds of activists in Trafalgar Square put black tape over their mouths, to symbolise the silencing of their protests by police and to demand the right to freedom of expression. Meanwhile in Kings Cross mothers insisted Google should ban those who deny or question climate change from posting videos on Youtube.\n\nThe protests are in open defiance of the Metropolitan Police, who on Monday issued a Section 14 order prohibiting XR demonstrations anywhere in the capital and leaving any protestors at risk of arrest.\n\nGuardian writer George Monbiot, who had penned a column on why he hoped to be arrested, was dragged away by police, as was Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley.\n\nPolice moved in on the Extinction Rebellion protest, including Guardian columnist George Monbiot (recumbent, with sign)\n\nSupporters had prevented Monbiot from being carried away by police, by lying next to him so they must be removed first\n\nGreen Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley was also arrested and carried away by police during the climate change protest\n\nIn Trafalgar Square councillor Andree Frieze, Green Party candidate for Richmond South, who took part, said: 'This symbolises the way our voices are being shut down, our voices are not being listened to.\n\n'Other people have brought the tape and they're sharing it around. It's a very powerful symbol of how our protest is being silenced. I believe the police action is illegal.\n\n'This is a question of civil liberties. Everyone at Trafalgar Square now is at risk of arrest.'\n\nIn open defiance of Monday's police ban, Extinction Rebellion protestors gathered en masse in Trafalgar Square yesterday\n\nThe Extinction Rebellion 'Autumn Uprising' in London started last Monday and has caused widespread disruption in the city\n\nYesterday a senior Met officer insisted the ban on XR's 'Autumn Uprising' climate change protests issued on Monday is legal - despite a review having been requested by lawyers - and warned activists they face arrest.\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor, who is leading the policing of the demonstrations, said he is 'completely comfortable' with the action the force has taken.\n\nLawyers for XR were at the High Court on Wednesday to apply for a judicial review of the ban amid claims that the order is not legal and breaches the right to protest.\n\nMr Taylor said: 'We are very confident that what we've done is entirely lawful, entirely proportionate in the circumstances, and we are completely comfortable with the position that we maintain.'\n\nThe force used section 14 of the Public Order Act initially to restrict the protest action to Trafalgar Square, but following 'continued breaches' of the order officers moved in to clear the area.\n\nAny assembly of more than two people linked to the XR Autumn Uprising action is now illegal in London.\n\nSo far 1,642 protesters have been arrested, and 133 charged. XR's stated tactics are to overwhelm the capacity in police custody, including by refusing bail after being arrested.\n\nA large crowd of mothers with children and babies, including several women who breeastfed their babies during the protest, gathered outside Google's London HQ yesterday to protest Google allowing Youtube to host climate denial videos\n\nDAC Taylor said: 'Extinction Rebellion have explicitly said they intend to target the Underground network.\n\n'That will cause huge disruption for London and we consider that wholly unacceptable, and obviously will be policing that with our partners at British Transport Police.\n\n'It will cause a huge impact to London and all the commuters and everybody using the Underground network. Obviously we will be policing that proactively and robustly.'", "description": "Furious London commuters dragged Extinction Rebellion protestors down from on top of a tube train after they tried to disrupt this morning's travel from Canning Town station.", "authors": ["Joel Adams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/07/19823834-0-image-a-30_1571295016673.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
