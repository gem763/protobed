House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the Democratic-controlled House would begin impeachment proceedings.\n\nFirst leader to comment directly on impeachment\n\nSingh is the first of the Canadian party leaders to comment directly on the possible impeachment of Trump.\n\n\"Congress members will make the decision,\" Singh said in French on Wednesday outside Vancouver's city hall during a media conference. \"I think there's a lot of proof to move forward with these proceedings.\"\n\nQuestioned about the impact of the proceedings on the ratification of the new Canada-U.S.-Mexico Trade Agreement, Liberal Leader Justin Trueau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer this week simply declared they would keep an eye on how things evolved.\n\nRelations with Canada's strongest ally and biggest trade partner, the United States, have been filled with ups and downs since Donald Trump took office in 2016.\n\nIt's been a difficult file for Canada to manage, including weathering a long, rocky renegotiation of the North American trade pact formerly known as NAFTA.\n\nIn June 2018, the United States slapped new tariffs on Canada: 25 per cent on imports of steel and 10 per cent on aluminum, citing national security. Canada retaliated with tariffs on U.S. steel, aluminum and other consumer products.", "description": "NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh joked that he hopes Donald Trump \"gets impeached\" when asked Thursday evening what would he first say to the U.S. president if he was prime minister.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5299369.1569568991!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-ndp-20190926.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
