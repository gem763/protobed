That\u2019s on a day when most markets were in cautious mood in the aftermath of the attacks on Saudi Arabia and ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day .\n\nBy 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), the was down less than 0.1%, as was the German . The U.K. was up 0.3%, largely a reflection of latest drop.\n\nThe Asian IPO is set to be a trimmed-down affair: after failing to agree with investors on valuation the first time around, it stripped out the mature Australian business and sold it to Japan\u2019s Asahi for $11.3 billion.\n\nWhat remains is a smaller, but faster-growing and more China-focused entity. According to the WSJ, the brewer is now targeting an overall valuation of $45.6 billion to $50.7 billion. The mid-point of that range is around 35 times next year\u2019s estimated earnings, the paper adds.\n\nThe IPO volume could be as much as $4.84 billion. Even after the surgery to cut out the Australian ops, that could still leave the deal as the world\u2019s second-biggest IPO this year after Uber Technologies (NYSE: ). (Competition for that title from WeWork\u2019s parent may be fading after the We Company reportedly delayed its prospective IPO for at least a month.)\n\nEven the new valuation might seem ambitious to some. Prospective investors are being asked to bet on what is now a much higher-beta project where the prospects of faster sales growth have to be weighed against Chinese macroeconomic risk \u2013 specifically in the shape of foreign exchange risk. After four years of diligently-managed exchange rate stability, China has let the slide by over 3% this year against the dollar. Where it might go to in the event of a fully-fledged trade war and a Chinese credit crunch is far from certain \u2013 even if Beijing does have a strong vested interest in preventing a further yuan depreciation in light of Chinese corporates high dollar indebtedness.\n\nHowever, anything that reduces the company's debt burden is welcome to AB Inbev's management - and, apparently, its shareholders too.", "description": "StockBeat: AB Inbev Hits Highest in a Month on Asia IPO 2.0", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC1O085_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
