Be it the selfie with daughter, selfie with cow, selfie with ink, governments across states have been promoting it religiously.\n\nBut what the Madhya Pradesh government has just asked newly-weds in the state is taking this to an all-new level.\n\nApplicants under \u2018Mukhya Mantri Kanya Vivah/Nikah Yojna\u2019 are being told in Madhya Pradesh if they want to get married and the brides-to-be want to become eligible to receive Rs 51,000 under the scheme.\n\nAs per the government scheme, brides from economically backward sections of the state are eligible to receive Rs 51,000 provided they prove that the groom\u2019s house has a toilet before the wedding. And for that, it has been made mandatory for the groom to click a selfie while standing in the toilet in his residence.\n\nDon't Miss 391 SHARES 124 SHARES 2.2 K SHARES 525 SHARES\n\nAccording to the government, the initiative is aimed at ensuring that toilets are constructed in every household in the state.\n\nOfficials stated that the toilet clause was there since the launch of the scheme in 2013, but the photographs are a recent addition.\n\n\u201cWe submit the forms of applicants under the scheme to the municipal corporation. It requires two affidavits and a selfie of the groom inside the toilet of their residence. The form is rejected and the couples are not allowed to get married in the \u2018sammelan\u2019 if the picture is not submitted,\u201d Mukhtar Hassan who runs Zara Hassan Welfare Samiti told ANI.\n\nBCCL/ FILE\n\n\u201cI had submitted the form and was asked to submit a selfie inside a toilet. When I objected, they said that if we don\u2019t submit the picture, our form will not be approved,\u201d Muhammad Yusuf who got married on Thursday in a mass ceremony at Central Library Ground in Bhopal said.\n\nAnother groom Mohammad Saddam said instead of checking selfies, government officials should visit houses to ensure if toilets had indeed been constructed. \u201cWhy do we have to submit a selfie? We can as easily take a picture in any toilet. A government official should come and see if there is a toilet in the house.\u201d\n\nSofia, a bride at the community wedding, however, welcomed the initiative and said: \u201cIt is not wrong to ensure that there is a toilet in a house. I think this is a good decision.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time 'selfie' has been associated with the Swachh Bharat campaign.\n\nA couple of years ago, the Rajasthan government had asked primary school teachers in rural areas to click selfies with people seen relieving themselves in the open, in an attempt to discourage open defecation.", "description": "Applicants under \u2018Mukhya Mantri Kanya Vivah/Nikah Yojna\u2019 are being told in Madhya Pradesh if they want to get married and the brides-to-be want to become eligible to receive Rs 51,000 under the scheme.
