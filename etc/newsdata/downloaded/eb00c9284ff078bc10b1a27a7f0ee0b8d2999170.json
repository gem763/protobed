Adam Schiff's, D-Calif., House Intelligence Committee.\n\nHe claimed the whistleblower neglected to tell the inspector general he had interacted with Schiff's team.\n\n\"So now, what do we have, a second whistleblower. Again, the transcript's out, it speaks for itself -- it's not an impeachable offense, period,\" he said.\n\nAttorney Mark Zaid, who represents both whistleblowers, first told ABC News that the second individual is \u2013 like the first whistleblower \u2013 an intelligence official, and has firsthand knowledge of certain allegations contained in the first whistleblower complaint, which was not based on any firsthand knowledge.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLater in his interview on \"Hannity,\" Sekulow also criticized the lawsuit brought against the president by New York County District Attorney Cy Vance Jr.\n\nHe read from the judges ruling, temporarily halting a subpoena of Trump's tax returns, and characterized the events as the \"House of Representatives basically extending their investigation through the local D.A.\"", "description": "President Trump's attorney on Monday dismissed the appearance of a second whistleblower in regard to his July phone call with the president of Ukraine.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Sekulow-Hannity.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
