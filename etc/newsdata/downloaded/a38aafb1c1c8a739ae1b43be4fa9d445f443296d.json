Jeon Heon-kyun/Pool via REUTERS\n\nSouth Korea showcased newly acquired F-35 stealth fighter jets to mark Armed Forces Day as Moon tried to allay concerns that his policy of engagement with North Korea would weaken the South\u2019s commitment to defense.\n\nHe said a South Korean F-15K jet patrolled over the disputed islets called Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan, which are controlled by Seoul and claimed by both countries, a move that could inflame already strained ties between the two.\n\n\u201cJust a moment ago, the F-15K, the most powerful fighter-bomber in Northeast Asia, has returned from completing a patrol mission over our land Dokdo... without any problems,\u201d Moon said in an address to the military.\n\nOn Friday, South Korean government officials had protested against Tokyo\u2019s annual defense review which made a reference to Japan owning the islands. South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry summoned a military official at the Japanese embassy in Seoul to demand an immediate retraction.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan have been locked in a worsening diplomatic and trade row rooted in wartime history and disagreements over compensation for forced laborers during Japan\u2019s 1910-1945 occupation of Korea.\n\nAfter Japan tightened its curbs on exports of high-tech materials vital to South Korea\u2019s chip and display industries in July, both countries have removed each other from fast-track trade status.\n\nIn July, a Russian military aircraft twice violated airspace over the disputed islands and drew hundreds of warning shots from South Korean jets, South Korean officials said, during what Russia said was a long-range joint air patrol with China.\n\nRelated Coverage South Korea fighter jet conducts patrol flight over island disputed by Japan\n\nJapan, which said it also scrambled fighter aircraft at the time, lodged a complaint with both South Korea and Russia over the incident.\n\nThe islands had 28 South Korean residents as of Tuesday, according to South Korean police.\n\nF-35 DELIVERIES\n\nMoon marked Armed Forces Day at a ceremony at an airbase in the city of Daegu where four of the eight Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) F-35A jets delivered this year were displayed. Forty of the aircraft are to be delivered by 2021.\n\nHe made no direction mention of Japan, or North Korea, in his address, but said today\u2019s security climate was highly unpredictable, requiring strength as well as innovation.\n\n\u201cAs the recent drone attack in the Middle East region demonstrated to the world, the challenges that we will face will be entirely different from those of the past,\u201d he said.\n\nNorth Korea has criticized the South\u2019s weapons procurements and its joint military drills with the U.S. military as undisguised preparations for war that are forcing it to develop new short-range missiles.\n\nMoon has thrown his support behind dialogue to end the North\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, urging that working-level negotiations between the North and the United States be held soon. No new dates or locations have been set.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nAnalysts have said the F-35 stealth jets put North Korea\u2019s anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems in a vulnerable position.\n\n(Graphic: Map of disputed islands Dokdo/Takeshima, here)", "description": "A South Korean fighter jet conducted a patrol flight on Tuesday over islands at the center of a bitter dispute with Japan, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said at an event marking the founding of the South Korean military.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435757289&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901X2", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
