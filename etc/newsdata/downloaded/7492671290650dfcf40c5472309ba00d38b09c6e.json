And the scandal breaking through is merely causing him to express more and more of them.\n\nTrump retweeted a bot that inserts \u201cshark\u201d into Trump tweets\n\nThe Ukraine story is damaging to Trump not necessarily because it\u2019s the worst thing he\u2019s done as president. But the assistance to Ukraine that Trump imperiled is something many Republicans favor, and the facts of the case are so plain that it has slightly punctured the bubble of right-wing alternative facts that normally shields the president from criticism.\n\nThat makes Trump particularly vulnerable to mildly critical commentary like what Fox News host Ed Henry offered on Sunday morning\u2019s edition of Fox & Friends. Fortunately for Trump, radio host Mark Levin was also on the air ready to go to bat with arguments like, \u201cWhat crime was violated? It\u2019s not illegal. The question is whether Biden did something illegal. The president didn\u2019t do anything illegal.\u201d\n\nTrump was so incensed by Henry that he or a staffer went to search Twitter for any random person criticizing Henry or praising Levin, including a number of \u201cegg\u201d accounts with no avatars, real names, or reputation, and few followers.\n\nOne of these accounts, @BulldawgDerek, has been \u201ctemporarily restricted\u201d by Twitter due to \u201cunusual activity\u201d \u2014 normally a euphemism for violating the site\u2019s rules.\n\nTrump retweeted, all told, 20 posts on the subject, including one calling Henry a \u201clying shit head\u201d and one by a bot account Trump But About Sharks whose gimmick is that it rewrites Trump tweets to make them about sharks.\n\nThis is mostly funny rather than revelatory.\n\nIt is, however, a reminder that the president of the United States spends his time watching television and getting mad online rather than working on any of the innumerable policy issues that fall into his portfolio. That\u2019s not news, but it is significant since one of the White House\u2019s key talking points on impeachment is that somehow impeachment \u2014 rather than the president\u2019s laziness \u2014 is stopping Congress from getting things done.\n\nTrump keeps lying about Congress\n\nA Saturday tweet calling an arbitrary subset of Trump\u2019s political enemies \u201csavages\u201d attracted attention because there\u2019s something fishy about his decision to single out Jewish and nonwhite members of Congress for criticism.\n\nCan you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like Nadler, Schiff, AOC Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me. Oh well, maybe next time! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 28, 2019\n\nA more banal but significant aspect of this tweet is Trump\u2019s effort to label the congressional opposition as \u201cDo Nothings.\u201d\n\nBoth parties\u2019 congressional campaign committees have polling that indicates the public is frustrated with Congress\u2019 lack of progress on policy issues and therefore have adopted strategies centered on blaming the other party for inaction.\n\nThis theme recurs in recent Trump tweets on subjects ranging from China to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to nothing in particular, all of which repeat the phrase \u201cDo Nothing Democrats.\u201d\n\nUnder the circumstances, it\u2019s worth emphasizing that this is simply false. House Democrats have passed a lot of bills, including conceptually ambitious legislation to curb corruption in politics and begin to address climate change along with a host of smaller measures. They\u2019ve passed legislation on background checks for gun buyers, tried to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, tried to extend nondiscrimination rules to LGBTQ people, and tried to raise the minimum wage to $15/hour. The reason these bills \u2014 and measures addressing prescription drug prices, insurance for people with preexisting conditions, and consumer protection in financial services \u2014 aren\u2019t going anywhere is that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell won\u2019t bring them up for votes.\n\nIt isn\u2019t even that these bills are being defeated in the Senate. McConnell is aware that these are popular measures, and he doesn\u2019t want to make his members cast unpopular votes against them. Consequently, Republicans have simply refused to let them come to the floor, even while pretending to be mad that Democrats are too busy with impeachment to legislate.\n\nWHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nBy contrast, Senate Republicans are not passing popular bills featuring conservative ideas to address problems. Not because they\u2019re too busy with impeachment, but because they don\u2019t seem to have any.\n\nAnd Trump himself can\u2019t stop tweeting about Ukraine, even though he also can\u2019t offer any real defense of what he did.\n\nTrump has a lot of dishonest thoughts on Ukraine\n\nMonday morning, Trump alleged that some mysterious individual \u201cchanged the long standing whistleblower rules\u201d as part of what is presumably a conspiracy to bring Trump down.\n\nWHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nThis is a reference to a badly misinformed article which ran over the weekend on the perennially dishonest conservative site the Federalist, which alleged that \u201cIntel Community Secretly Gutted Requirement Of First-Hand Whistleblower Knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe main factual problem with this article is that nothing of the sort happened. It is true that the whistleblower form was changed in August shortly before the submission of the Ukraine report, but the earlier version of the form contained no prohibition on the use of second-hand information. That the Federalist article is incorrect has not prevented the claim from being widely rebroadcast by everyone from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to the president\u2019s attorneys Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani. It is, however, completely false.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, despite Trump\u2019s multiple tweets referring to the whistleblower as \u201cfake\u201d or alleging he had only \u201cSECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION,\u201d we now know unambiguously that the substance of the report was true. The White House\u2019s own summary of the call shows Trump complaining that although \u201cthe United States has been very good to Ukraine,\u201d he \u201cwouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been reciprocal necessarily.\u201d\n\nWhen Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asks for Javelin missiles, Trump replies, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though.\u201d There is, of course, nothing wrong with the leader of one country asking the leader of another country for something in exchange for military assistance \u2014 that\u2019s diplomacy. But what Trump asked for were political favors (and perhaps exculpate the Russian government from responsibility for hacking the Democratic National Committee), not actions designed to advance American interests.\n\nThat\u2019s the essence of the complaint, and Trump clearly did it. The only question is whether one sees that as right or wrong. But in responding to the misconduct, Trump is engaging in new forms of misconduct.\n\nTrump is threatening his enemies with prison\n\nLast Friday, House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff opened a hearing with a satirical parody of Trump\u2019s gangster-like conduct.\n\nThe analogy between the way Trump discusses illegal activities and the way movie gangsters talk has been widely made, everywhere from CNN to the Canadian magazine Macleans, largely because the president\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen specifically described it as his normal means of doing business.\n\nBut Trump, because he\u2019s a deeply dishonest person, has taken to characterizing Schiff\u2019s parody as a deliberate fabrication that should prompt a criminal investigation.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions. He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not a crime to say things the president doesn\u2019t like \u2014 even things that aren\u2019t necessarily proven \u2014 and there\u2019s a specific clause of the Constitution guaranteeing members of Congress absolute immunity from prosecution from anything they do on the floor of either house in the Capitol. That constitutional provision does, however, include an exception for treason, which someone must have told Trump. By Sunday night, Schiff characterizing his actions in a way Trump didn\u2019t like was elevated to an act of treason, and Trump called for his arrest.\n\nHis lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019\n\nTrump then reiterated Monday morning that he\u2019s not kidding around. He wants police officers to arrest a member of Congress for criticizing him.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nThe typical response to this kind of blatantly inappropriate order from Trump has been to simply not carry out his directives. Then conservatives quietly assure liberal and centrist journalists that people shouldn\u2019t blow Trump\u2019s bluster out of perspective because these things don\u2019t actually wind up happening.\n\nThe Ukraine call, however, reveals not just inappropriate conduct but the fundamental inadequacy of this line of thought as a response to Trump. Members of Trump\u2019s administration have been trying, since Inauguration Day, to steer him toward something approaching a normal conservative Republican approach to Russia.\n\nBut as Trump\u2019s former top Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert explained over the weekend, it\u2019s been impossible to dissuade Trump from propagating a baroque conspiracy theory involving Ukraine and an IT security company called Crowdstrike, whose CEO Trump wrongly believes is Ukrainian.\n\nTrump really did delay the delivery of congressionally authorized military aid to Ukraine, and during his one-on-one talks with the Ukrainian president he linked that aid to both the Crowdstrike theory and the effort to dig up dirt on a political rival. With the regular institutions of the American government ill-disposed to try to carry out Trump\u2019s corrupt approach to Ukraine, he got Rudy Giuliani to run a \u201cshadow foreign policy\u201d on his behalf.\n\nIn other words: There are limits to what can be accomplished by slow-walking an unfit president\u2019s requests. Schiff probably won\u2019t be brought up on treason charges. And Trump probably won\u2019t follow through on his threats to unleash a civil war. But over time, a determined president does tend to make things happen.\n\nResponsible officials made a good-faith effort to stonewall Trump\u2019s Ukraine agenda. But those officials either left office (Bossert, Secretary of Defense James Mattis) or were removed (former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch), and Trump\u2019s plan was put into place. In response, Trump displays no contrition but instead accelerates his lying and inappropriate demands. And the only viable solution is for him to stop being president.\n\nListen to Today, Explained\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee released the whistleblower complaint minutes before Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire began his testimony before Congress.\n\nLooking for a quick way to keep up with the never-ending news cycle?
