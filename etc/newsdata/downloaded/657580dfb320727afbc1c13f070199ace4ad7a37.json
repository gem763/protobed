You can also subscribe to our writing tips newsletter for even more tips.\n\nThis week's tip is from Trent Lewin.\n\n\"Get married to a person by all means, but never get married to your writing. Every word is precious. Every word is also expendable. Stories are created in the drafting but reveal themselves in the editing. To edit well, you have to give up on parts of your story, even the ones that you dearly love. Be brave and edit!\"\n\nTrent Lewin is a writer of short fiction, mostly about strange situations and odd characters, but firmly grounded in the real world. He was shortlisted for the CBC Short Story Prize in 2014 for Saad Steps Out. His story Boston D.C. made the 2019 CBC Short Story Prize longlist.", "description": "Trent Lewin has writing advice for those planning on entering the 2020 CBC Short Story Prize.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4814998.1536347351!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/woman-writin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
