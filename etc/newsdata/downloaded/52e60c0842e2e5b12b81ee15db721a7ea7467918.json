And I just instinctively put my hand out to try and stop him doing whatever he was doing.\n\n\"I must have caught the blade and he pulled away, and it was quite sharp, so it just opened me up.\"\n\nThe incident caused \"a whole scene,\" said Philippakis, as he was \"spilling blood on the whitewashed walls\" of a local church.\n\nInitially, friends \"tried to stop the bleeding by opening up some cigarettes and putting some tobacco on it\u2026 but then the blood was coming through, so I went and got stitches in the village.\"\n\nThe injury has forced Foals to pull out of Hamburg's Reeperbahn festival on Friday, but Philippakis says the injuries should heal.\n\n\"No tendons,\" were severed by the blade, \"and hopefully no nerves either,\" he said.\n\nFoals have drafted in The Maccabees' Felix White to play guitar at the Mercury Prize ceremony at London's Hammersmith Apollo.\n\nThey're one of the frontrunners to win the album of the year prize, for their fifth album Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost - Part 1, which distils the uncertainties of our crumbling political systems and ecological crises into an urgent, if disorientating, rock record.\n\nOther nominees include Slowthai, whose belligerent Nothing Great About Britain is currently the bookies' favourite.\n\nIdles' Joy As An Act Of Resistance and Dave's Psychodrama, both of which tackle the politics of division, are also looked upon favourably; alongside agenda-setting records by Little Simz and Anna Calvi.\n\nThe winner will be announced live on BBC Four, with coverage starting at 2100 BST.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
