The whole level of mediocrity is slowly going out of our rugby.\n\n\"We don't have the money that England have, but we definitely have the player pool,\" he said.\n\n\"Let's see how the final goes to see if we've turned the corner as much as we wanted to.\"\n\nSpringbok skipper Siya Kolisi praised Erasmus for changing the mindset around being an international.\n\n\"He knows us and he's here to pull us together and we're to buy into his plan,\" said Kolisi, appointed by Erasmus as South Africa's first black captain.\n\n\"As soon as he came, he made it clear that a Springbok is the most important thing. In the past most of us tried to build ourselves on social media and he brought us back to earth and told us you have to play well first and everything else will come.\"", "description": "The Rugby World Cup final between England and South Africa will not be won by an expansive gameplan and \"wonderful tries\", says Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9486/2299122b32c740588f40e76739778c55.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
