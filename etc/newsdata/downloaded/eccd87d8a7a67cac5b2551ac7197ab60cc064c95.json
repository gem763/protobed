Scheduled for full rollout in 2020, the system could help level the playing field, if well-implemented. But social credit will make falling afoul of regulations far more costly, and could be used as a weapon in trade disputes.\n\nPrivacy has always been a narrower concept in China than the West. Chinese-speaking foreigners can expect taxi drivers to grill about their income, marital status and other matters that strangers in the West usually avoid. And private electronic communications aren\u2019t really private from the government.\n\nThe flip side is that information doesn\u2019t actually flow well through society. Censorship and a Party-centric court system make whistleblowing difficult and dangerous, creating plenty of opportunities for corporate and official malfeasance. Losers are often small or foreign companies without good official contacts to bend the rules for them.\n\nCorporate social credit is meant, at least in part, to address this problem\u2014without fundamental social changes, like freeing the press, that could endanger Communist Party rule. Compliance or noncompliance with important regulations will be assigned a value and fed into an algorithm to produce a company\u2019s overall rating on, for example, environmental protection. This rating will be shared across agencies through a central database, to some extent publicly.\n\nUnder the social-credit system, polluting less may pay.

For instance, being \u201cdistrusted\u201d for customs purposes could affect not only border inspections but governmentwide approvals, currency transactions and the ability of the company\u2019s legal representative to purchase property, according to an August report from the European Union Chamber of Commerce. Data will be gathered from company submissions and inspections, but also eventually from video surveillance, remote instrument monitoring and third-party sources.\n\nIn theory, this will make favoritism harder: Computers, rather than people, will decide regulatory penalties and rewards. A less partial system could benefit foreign companies, says Jorg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber in China. For example, a foreign company with high-quality emissions-control equipment might be allowed to keep producing on heavily polluted days, while local competitors with poor compliance records might not.\n\nThere are downsides, however. Compliance costs will rise\u2014and that ripple effect means even minor infractions could cause severe damage. And the evolving requirements will be harder for small businesses to keep track of.\n\nAlso, some of the rating factors are political or highly discretionary. For example, under draft regulations released for comment in July, companies could be blacklisted for endangering national or public interest or for \u201cinfringing the legitimate rights and interests of customers.\u201d U.S. companies are doubtless contemplating such stipulations with deep disquiet.\n\nThe implications of an even more heavily monitored China\u2014already stingy with political and religious freedom\u2014are frightening, but may include less corruption and favoritism. Regardless of any potential benefit, companies that want to keep operating in China must brace for much more comprehensive data collection on their activities\u2014and even stiffer penalties for falling afoul of the panopticon.\n\nWrite to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com", "description": "International media have focused mostly on the dystopian potential of individual social-credit scores, but foreign businesses will be affected, too.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Taplin", "Nathaniel.Taplin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107732/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
