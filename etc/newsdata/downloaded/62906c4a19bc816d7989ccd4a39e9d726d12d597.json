That isn\u2019t a judgment call: There are plenty of good \u201cugly\u201d movies. And \u201cJoker\u201d is good in the sense that it is competently shot, beautifully acted, and ticks all the right boxes that a film like this, so heavily influenced by the Scorsese pictures of the 1970s, is supposed to tick.\n\nUgliness is a deliberate aesthetic choice of the film, an aesthetic aiding its main goal: to create a sense of atmosphere and tone so oppressive that it leaves no room for the story, or the audience, to breathe. It is a shame because as much as it plays up themes of class disparity, the pain of mental illness and the general brutal indifference of society, \u201cJoker\u201d doesn\u2019t actually seem interested in exploring these themes beyond using them as atmosphere builders, as plot devices.\n\nIt is particularly relevant when it comes to the presence of Black women in Joker\u2019s world, a presence so glaring yet so subtle it almost goes unnoticed. We see Joker, or Arthur Fleck (played superbly by Joaquin Phoenix) interact with six women over the course of the film. One of the women is a TV producer he speaks with briefly over the phone. Another is his disturbed mother, who he learns has been lying to him all his life. The remaining four women are all Black: a mother on the bus, his social worker, his neighbor/love interest Sophie (Zazie Beetz), and a psychiatrist at the mental hospital.\n\nIndividually, these characters don\u2019t give that much pause. But collectively, their presence made me wonder if there is a reason why the majority of the women Arthur interacts with on-screen happen to be Black. All of Arthur\u2019s interactions with women are fraught and charged, each one establishing his view of the world as a cold, apathetic hellscape. When he playfully makes a small child laugh during a bus ride, the kid\u2019s mother turns around and snaps at him, \u201cWill you please stop bothering my kid?\u201d His social worker is cold and standoffish, admonishes him. At one point, he calls her out for never really listening to anything he has to say.\n\nIt would be easy to say that the film\u2019s choices when it comes to Black women are willfully stereotypical or negative, playing up all-too familiar tropes of Black women as angry or cold. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a fair distinction though. These Black female characters don\u2019t feel forcefully lodged into the plot; they come up organically and naturally in the world that Arthur inhabits, and there are no strange or outlandish machinations that precede these interactions. Indeed, the original \u201cJoker\u201d script states explicitly that he lives in a Black neighborhood, though the film itself never makes this clear.\n\nBut the presence and treatment of Black women, particularly Beetz\u2019s character, are still worth considering, especially given the fact that writer-director Todd Phillips has famously cited two Martin Scorsese films, \u201cThe King of Comedy\u201d and \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d as inspirations for this iteration of the Joker\u2019s origin story.\n\nIn \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d Travis Bickle\u2019s racism and misogyny are implicit features of his personality. We see it in the way he sizes up the groups of Black men he encounters on the street and in the unabated glee with which he kills the Black man who robs a liquor store. Harvey Keitel\u2019s pimp character, it should also be noted, was originally supposed to be played by a Black man. In the film\u2019s final massacre, all the criminals Bickle kills were supposed to be Black, an indictment on his own racism, but studio executives called for that detail to be changed, afraid that there would be riots.\n\nWith \u201cJoker,\u201d there have been similar murmurings about how the film might incite violence, or fuel the ideologies of incel culture. Of course, \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d which \u201cJoker\u201d borrows heavily from, didn\u2019t cause riots. But \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d is a smarter movie than \u201cJoker,\u201d which, as writer Sarah Hagi aptly pointed out on Twitter, might as well be called \u201cWe live in a society: the movie.\u201d In other words, it simply doesn\u2019t have the range.\n\nWhere \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d makes it clear that Bickle\u2019s desire to rid the streets of \u201cscum\u201d is not actually a noble crusade but rather the result of his own selfish neuroses and prejudices, \u201cJoker\u201d never quite delves deep enough beyond its indictment of a nebulous arbitrary \u201csystem.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a fleeting, promising moment in the movie when Arthur\u2019s social worker informs him that funding for the program has been cut, and she will no longer be seeing him. She makes a comment, something along the lines of, \u201cThey [the people at the top] don\u2019t care about people like you and me.\u201d But the line just sort of hangs there in the air; it doesn\u2019t seem as if Arthur has actually absorbed (or can actually absorb) the idea that he is not the only cog in this grinding, indifferent machine. Rather than a critique of institutional abuse, the exchange feels more like an indictment on the individual for not understanding him, thereby justifying his hatred and his violence.\n\nMuch like \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and its ambiguous final montage, the thing to remember about \u201cJoker\u201d is that the story is being told intentionally and specifically through the main character\u2019s eyes. In the third act, the audience learns that the budding romance we\u2019ve witnessed between Arthur and Sophie has been all in his mind. He barges into her apartment, unannounced, and a startled Sophie pleads with him to leave.\n\nThe film cuts to the next scene, never showing Sophie\u2019s fate. The ambiguity of Sophie\u2019s fate is, in a sense, largely emblematic of the ambiguity with which this film tackles gender and race. It also calls into question everything else we\u2019ve seen up to this point \u2015 the asshole finance bros whom Joker kills early on in the film, his overbearing mother, Thomas Wayne\u2019s cruelty. The trick of \u201cJoker\u201d is presenting us Arthur\u2019s skewed version of the world as true and then, and the last minute, forcing us to question our own empathy for him. At least, that\u2019s the idea.\n\nThat\u2019s why his interactions with Black women are interesting, especially his infatuation with Sophie. If Black women play roles of alienating authority in his everyday life, it\u2019s significant that he would project a romantic fantasy onto a Black woman, casting her as the nurturing and supportive female figure that has eluded him up until now.\n\nThis is all worth thinking about, especially in a film that seems to be trying (but ultimately fails) to make some sort of commentary on the disparity between the haves and the have-nots. A racial reading of this movie is perhaps the last thing Phillips, who recently lamented how \u201cwoke\u201d culture killed his desire to make comedy, wants the viewer to take away from this. But you can\u2019t really have a discussion about class without having a discussion somewhere in there about race. I doubt Phillips was trying to make any sort of intentional commentary with his placement of Black women in positions of antagonizing authority or elusive romantic obsessions, but that\u2019s what makes these characters, arbitrary as they seem, so important.", "description": "Is there a reason why the majority of the women Joker interacts with on-screen happen to be Black?", "authors": ["Senior Culture Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d960720210000a40251fbe4.gif?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
