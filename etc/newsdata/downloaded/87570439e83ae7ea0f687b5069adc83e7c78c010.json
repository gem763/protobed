There is little expectation of an imminent resolution to the disagreement, which continues to sap economic growth.\n\n\"The darkening outlook for trade is discouraging but not unexpected,\" said WTO chief Roberto Azev\u00eado.\n\nThe WTO sees continued risks from the trade wars, saying that \"further rounds of tariffs and retaliation could produce a destructive cycle of recrimination.\"\n\nThe organization noted that some economies are slowing anyway while other outstanding trade issues, such as Britain's exit from the European Union, are adding to the uncertainty for businesses trading goods.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country is heading toward recession, said the friction around Brexit showed why Europe had no reason to be haughty about the U.S-China trade dispute.\n\n\"We've been negotiating for three years over Britain's orderly exit, and this is causing us great uncertainty, too,\" Merkel she said after a meeting Tuesday in Berlin with WTO's Azev\u00eado and the heads of four other international economic organizations.\n\n\"This exit is meant to happen on Oct. 31, and many businesspeople still don't know today what their supply chain is going to look like in the future,\" said Merkel.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
