They are angered by a Supreme Court ruling that sentenced nine of separatist leaders to prison for a failed 2017 secession attempt.\n\nPolls say the 7.5 million residents of the wealthy Catalonia region are roughly evenly divided on the secession question.\n\nPro-Spain demonstrators gather a long a street during a protest called by a unionist Catalan civil society group in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019.
