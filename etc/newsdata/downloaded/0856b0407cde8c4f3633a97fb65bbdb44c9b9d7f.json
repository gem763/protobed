Shares were up 1.2% premarket on Thursday.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote that Microsoft MSFT, +1.15% was \u201cpoised to weather any storm\u201d and keyed in on management\u2019s belief that the company is only in the first inning with several of its business areas, including data, artificial intelligence, and some security efforts.\n\n\u201cManagement noted that given its investments and growth drivers it believes it can sustain this strong business momentum in the face of any macro concerns,\u201d wrote Thill, who has a buy rating and $160 price target on the shares. \u201cThis is supported, in our opinion, by several growth drivers including Office 365, Microsoft Teams and PowerBI in addition to the already hypergrowing Azure.\u201d\n\nEvercore ISI\u2019s Kirk Materne heaped on the praise as well, writing that Microsoft was \u201cfiring on all cylinders\u201d with continued strength in the cloud that\u2019s supporting significant operating leverage and cash-flow growth.\n\n\u201cWhile the 2Q More Personal Computing revenue guide was slightly below Street expectations, this is largely related to a headwind in the gaming business and the company is expecting the momentum in the Commercial business to persist in F2Q/2H,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMaterne rates the stock at outperform and also has a $160 target.\n\nOpinion: Tesla is profitable again. How long will it last this time?\n\nBernstein\u2019s Mark Moerdler cheered Microsoft\u2019s \u201cexecution excellence\u201d, writing that while Azure\u2019s constant-currency growth was a bit lower than he had been projecting, the company showed strong server and tools growth.\n\n\u201cThe business model continues to bend the curve, leading to operating profit growth comfortably in the double digits,\u201d wrote Moerdler, who has an outperform rating and $167 target price on the shares. \u201cWe believe the story is long from over. After SAP\u2019s weakness earlier in the day, Microsoft\u2019s results should help investor sentiment.\u201d\n\nCowen & Co.\u2019s Nick Yako discussed Microsoft\u2019s partnership traction and highlighted an expanded deal with SAP that positions Microsoft as the partner of choice for those looking to move their enterprise resource planning from on-premise to the cloud. \u201cThe fact that SAP opted to extend the partnership exclusively with Microsoft \u2013 while still providing customers flexibility to leverage [Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s] AWS or [Alphabet Inc.\u2019s] GCP \u2013 gives us confidence that customers are increasingly viewing Azure as the cloud platform of choice,\u201d he wrote.\n\nYako has an outperform rating and $155 target price.\n\nRead: Twitter stock tumbles 20% after company says advertising bugs weighing on earnings\n\nMacquarie analyst Sarah Hindlian said that Microsoft\u2019s forward looking commentary came as a \u201crelief\u201d as the company now projects that operating margins will tick up, compared with a prior forecast that called for them to stay flat.\n\n\u201cWe think Microsoft is executing remarkably well on its transition to the cloud, delivering and timing product cycles to maintain growth with tight cost controls, effectively investing in leading product sets, and delivering growth at record scale,\u201d wrote Hindlian, who has an outperform rating on the stock and a $160 price target.\n\nOf the 33 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover Microsoft\u2019s stock, 31 have buy ratings and two have hold ratings. The average price target is $160.17, about 17% above Wednesday\u2019s close.\n\nShares have gained 35% so far this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.30% has risen 15%.", "description": "Analysts found few things to gripe about in Microsoft Corp.\u2019s latest earnings report as the stock ticked slightly higher in premarket trading Thursday.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GI919_micros_ZG_20180510083121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
