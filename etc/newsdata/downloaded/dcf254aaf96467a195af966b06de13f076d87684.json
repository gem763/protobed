Photo: HBO\n\nSuccession relishes playing the name game. The regal and imperious air of the Roy family is reflected in their on-the-nose last name, French for \u201cking.\u201d The duplicity and nastiness that the Roy children assume as birthright comes out in the nicknames for firstborn, Connor (\u201cCon\u201d), and lone daughter, Siobhan (\u201cShiv\u201d). Throw in the names of longtime Waystar Royco counsel Gerri Killmann as well as the rival media family that proved to be just as cutthroat as the Roys (the Pierces), and the ruthlessness of the dramatis personae is revealed before the first insult is delivered.\n\nDig even deeper into the show\u2019s naming patterns and you\u2019ll find a further layer of nomenclatural richness. Again and again, ancient Greek and Roman references bubble up in episodes and lurk behind the names of pivotal characters, adding to both the gravity and the humor of the show\u2019s unfolding drama, while also pointing to where the show may be heading and how the succession in Succession might play out.\n\nBut before addressing the names drawn from Greek and Roman myth and history, it\u2019s worth first noting just how thickly such references occupy the show\u2019s air. At the Argestes retreat for the superrich, the setting of an episode of the same name, this is quite literally the case: Argestes means \u201cclearing\u201d or \u201cbrightening\u201d in Greek and became a name for the South Wind, whose gusts were thought to have a clearing effect on the skies. The retreat produces such an outcome for the Roys, as the venue sees their built-up tension with the Pierces cleared in sweeping but messy fashion in the episode\u2019s dramatic final sequence: Pierce family matriarch Nan calls off the deal between the families and storms out of the retreat, with Logan chasing after her in a panic. The clarifying gust provided by Argestes turns out to be more of a tornado.\n\nAnother display of the show\u2019s Classical pomp comes in the plumed Corinthian helmet that peers out from behind Logan\u2019s desk (a nod, perhaps, to Brian Cox\u2019s turn as the equally menacing Agamemnon in 2004\u2019s Troy). And then there is Rhea Jarrell\u2019s suggestion to Shiv in \u201cReturn\u201d that Nan Pierce \u201cwouldn\u2019t mind putting a fucking sharp, burnt stick in your dad\u2019s cyclops eye\u201d \u2014 an image that casts Logan as the boorish, myopic cyclops Polyphemus, poised to be outsmarted and ousted by the next Odysseus who crosses his path.\n\nAlso bandied about are references to the myth of Oedipus, the Greek hero who unwittingly kills his own father, succeeds him as king of Thebes, and marries his own mother. In \u201cWhich Side Are You On?\u201d, youngest son Roman approaches Waystar Royco board member Lawrence Yee about the plan he and brother Kendall are hatching for a vote of no confidence in their father. \u201cYou and Kendall are thinking of killing your dad? Well, that\u2019s a little Greek tragedy,\u201d responds Lawrence, whose partner adds, \u201cYeah, Oedipus.\u201d Roman picks up from there, follows the myth through to its next disturbing episode, and entertains the thought of sleeping with his mother-in-law, Marcia, since \u201cthat\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s like phase two.\u201d But it is the pointed differences between the Roy sons\u2019 Oedipal narrative and Oedipus\u2019s own that are perhaps most interesting. First of all, Logan\u2019s children have, to this point, failed in any attempts at corporate patricide. Secondly, their efforts are not unwitting. Betrayal is the modus operandi of the Roys, as indeed everyone in their orbit knows. When Rhea first meets Kendall in \u201cSafe Room,\u201d she extends her hand with the greeting, \u201cAnd you must be Oedipus Roy.\u201d\n\nIt is in and around Rhea that many of the Greek and Roman references in Succession\u2019s second season converge. She arrives on the scene in \u201cSafe Room,\u201d visiting the Waystar Royco headquarters in her capacity as the CEO of the Pierce Media Group to entertain offers for a buyout. Her visit prompts longtime Roy family advisor Frank Vernon to confide to Logan, \u201cShe could be our Coriolanus.\u201d The reference is to Gaius Marcius Coriolanus, a quasi-historical Roman general (and subject of Shakespeare\u2019s Coriolanus) who betrayed Rome and besieged the city while commanding the army of a rival state.\n\nLogan replies to Frank\u2019s learned analogy with the unforgettable quip, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take your library card and fuck off?\u201d (Which would surely be his response to this piece, too.) But Frank\u2019s prediction proves to be more or less accurate: Rhea does betray the Pierces, does come to work for Logan, and, in \u201cDundee,\u201d is announced by Logan as Waystar Royco\u2019s next CEO, its lead general.\n\nWhile Rhea emerges as a Coriolanus figure, the other mythical reference in this character is more direct. Rhea is the name of one of the Greek gods known as the Titans. She is the daughter of Earth and Sky, the wife of Cronus, and the mother of the Olympian gods Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, and Demeter. She is a divinity of great influence, and, crucially, an expert at the machinations of divine succession. When the powerful but paranoid Cronus is scheming to devour his children so as to prevent the rise of a successor (sound familiar?), it is Rhea who outsmarts him, conspires with her parents Earth and Sky, and gives birth to eventual successor Zeus in a concealed place.\n\nParallels with Roy family drama are not precise, but the name Rhea surely evokes this formidable goddess and her pivotal role in the divine succession myth. And it leads viewers to wonder: Has Succession\u2019s Rhea, like her mythical forerunner, outmaneuvered the Cronus-like Logan? Does she have the smarts to align with other powerful players, as the Titan Rhea did?\n\nWhile the figure of Rhea from Greek myth looms large in season two, connections with the ancient Romans run strong across the arc of the show. In the Roy family\u2019s big meet-up with the more cultured Pierces in \u201cTern Haven,\u201d Logan offers a toast and introduces the Roys as \u201clike Romans among the Greeks. I\u2019m sure you find us all rather, you know, big, vulgar, and boisterous.\u201d His words draw on an age-old stereotype of Rome as militaristic, moved along by men of action, with aspirations of imperial dominance. In \u201cDundee,\u201d Logan\u2019s brother and fierce detractor, Ewan, picks up on this comparison when reflecting on the damages done by Waystar Royco\u2019s media empire. He hearkens to a celebrated Roman historian when saying of Logan, \u201cTacitus comes to mind \u2026 He\u2019s made a wasteland, and calls it an empire,\u201d prompting a spot-on bit of literary criticism from Ewan\u2019s grandson, Greg: \u201cGod, Tacitus \u2026 all killer, no filler with him.\u201d Ewan is loosely quoting a statement Tacitus included in a speech by the Caledonian warrior Calgacus, as he rallied his men to stand up to Rome\u2019s invasion of Britain in the first century C.E. (actual quote: \u201cThey make a wasteland and call it peace\u201d). And so one proud Caledonian \u2014 that is, Ewan \u2014 picks up on the words of another, each decrying an empire that is sprawling out to world dominance. Bad news for Ewan, though: Calgacus and his Caledonians are summarily crushed.\n\nIn spite of condemnation from the likes of Ewan, neither Logan nor the Roy children seem at all interested in downplaying their \u201cRoman-ness.\u201d Quite the opposite: Their vulgarity, boisterousness, and airs for domination are an essential part of the family identity. And this brings us back to the youngest Roy child, whose name is simply Roman. For the Roy who is the most vulgar, the most preening, the most like the boy-emperors Caligula and Nero, Roman is the perfect name.\n\nHowever, the name Roman is not enough for this Roy. Across the show, Logan routinely uses another name for his youngest: Romulus. In Roman myth, Romulus was the son of Mars, the god of war, and he rose to be the first king of Rome after killing his twin brother, Remus, in a contest for the throne. Do Succession\u2019s nods to Romulus and his tale point us toward similar developments in the empire of Waystar Royco? After all, it is only Logan who calls his son Romulus. And he does so at key moments \u2014 in their very first exchange in the pilot, in the first season episode when Logan pressures him at the boardroom table to backstab his brother Remus (er, Kendall), and when Roman votes to tank the investment in Vaulter, the website that Kendall had championed. Are Logan\u2019s well-placed drops of this name signs of the coronation that is ultimately to come? Is this a case of nomen as omen? Will Romulus Roy (\u201cKing the King\u201d) emerge, after boardroom bloodshed, as Succession\u2019s successor?\n\nOr will Succession only confound things further, pulling in more threads of myth, piling on more Greek and Roman references, filling the air with more ancient and ominous spirits?", "description": "Ancient Greek and Roman references add to both the gravity and the humor of Succession\u2019s unfolding drama, while also pointing to where the Roy family may be heading.
