No wonder. He promised he would narrow trade deficits by renegotiating trade agreements, using tariffs as a stick. That promise is important to his 2020 campaign, even though trade deficits are not material to the strength of the economy. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a promise he hasn\u2019t kept.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit rose with 10 of the U.S.\u2019s 15 biggest trading partners between 2016 and 2018. Worldwide, it hit a record $891.3 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow by 7-8 percent in 2019.\n\nThe deficit in goods trade with China grew from $347 billion when Trump took office to a record $419.5 billion at the end of 2018 and for 2019 it stands at $200 billion as of the end of July. U.S. exports to China dropped by more than 26 percent from China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLarge soybean exports to China helped narrow our trade deficit in the past, but those exports plummeted by more than $10 billion since China halted its soybean purchases. China just announced it will exempt U.S. soybeans and some other agricultural products from its tariffs for a year, though it\u2019s unclear what that will mean for farmers. Promised accommodations like that have not materialized in the past. Even if the tariffs are removed, the quest to recapture the lost $10 billion will be long and uncertain. China has lowered tariffs on other trading partners and found new soybean suppliers in the EU, Argentina, Brazil and Russia.\n\nBeijing lowered tariffs on non-US products to an average of 6.7 percent, while it raised them on American products to an average of 20.7 percent. It's 14 percent cheaper for China to buy from Canada, Japan, Brazil and Europe than to buy from the U.S., which makes it hard for U.S. companies to compete for access to China\u2019s 1.4 billion consumers. So we\u2019re selling less to China and our trade gap is widening even more.\n\nTariffs can worsen trade deficits by reducing demand for a country\u2019s products along with demand for its currency, which will fall against the dollar and make exports more expensive and imports cheaper. If Trump\u2019s tariffs are weakening the Chinese economy, they are also weakening the yuan against the dollar, making it more expensive for China to buy from the U.S. and adding to the trade deficit.\n\nThat said, Trump\u2019s obsession with trade deficits is misplaced. They\u2019re not an indication of the strength of a country\u2019s economy. The consensus among economists is that bilateral trade balances matter far less than other indicators such as relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. Indeed, last year\u2019s higher U.S. trade deficit resulted mainly from the economy\u2019s strength and robust spending on foreign goods.\n\nThe dollar\u2019s value also has a significant impact on the balance of trade. U.S. exports rose by 50 percent from 2001 to 2007 as the dollar declined 40 percent against the euro.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen foreign companies sell their goods to the U.S., they get paid in dollars. Those dollars return to the U.S. as investments in assets such as stocks and corporate and treasury bonds. So U.S. imports actually help find buyers for the treasury bonds and notes necessary to finance our massive budget deficit.\n\nThere are some circumstances where trade deficits could hurt us, for example if foreign buyers stop recirculating their dollars into the U.S. economy. But that\u2019s unlikely. The U.S. is the world\u2019s strongest economy. The dollar is the largest reserve currency and the most-used currency for commodity and other transactions.\n\nA trade deficit can also hurt a country\u2019s economy if it\u2019s due to other countries not buying its goods, to the point where it damages companies and increases unemployment. Low demand for a country\u2019s goods can devalue its currency and raise inflation and interest rates. But none of this is the case for the U.S.\n\nTrump claims that the U.S. trade deficit caused high budget deficits and the accumulated $20 trillion national debt. That\u2019s an example of Trump needing no basis for what he says. Trade and budget deficits aren\u2019t connected.\n\nIf the U.S. bought nothing from other countries, it would have no trade deficit. But nearly all federal spending would continue. The government would still have to fund its agencies, the military, entitlements and all its other expenses. The U.S. ran trade deficits during years it had budget surpluses. Japan, Canada, and Australia have trade surpluses while running budget deficits. Only eight of 35 OECD countries have both types of deficits.\n\nEven though they\u2019re not an indicator of economic strength, Trump obsesses over delivering on his pledge to narrow trade deficits ahead of the 2020 election. But his tariffs are hurting U.S. consumers and businesses and alienating our closest allies.\n\nTrump has justified them based on authority Congress granted to the president to set tariffs under circumstances that threaten national security. But Trump\u2019s claim of security threats won\u2019t stand up in court, experts say. Even Republicans have condemned Trump's tariffs as bad for the economy. If anything, it's the tariffs themselves that pose a threat, and it\u2019s time for Congress to take back its full Constitutional power to set them.\n\nNeil Baron advised the SEC and congressional staff on rating agency reform.
