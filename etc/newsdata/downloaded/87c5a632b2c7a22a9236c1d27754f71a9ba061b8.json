On his Late Late Show with James Corden last Thursday night, the British comedian took the time to take his fellow talk show host Bill Maher to task over recent fat-shaming remarks.\n\n\u201cFat shaming doesn\u2019t need to end, it needs to make a comeback,\u201d Maher, who is the star of Real Time with Bill Maher on HBO, opined late in August. \u201cSome amount of shame is good. We shamed people out of smoking and into wearing seat belts. We shamed them out of littering and most of them out of racism. Shame is the first step in reform.\u201d\n\nTo this, Corden had some thoughts of his own. \u201cFat-shaming never went anywhere,\u201d he responded. \u201cAsk literally any fat person. We are reminded of it all the time.\u201d He went on: \u201cThere\u2019s a common and insulting misconception that fat people are stupid and lazy, and we\u2019re not\u2026 We know that being overweight isn\u2019t good for us and I\u2019ve struggled my entire life trying to manage my weight and I suck at it. I\u2019ve had good days and bad months.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up interview with Entertainment Tonight after winning his Emmys, Corden further explained his response, saying he has \u201cnothing but respect\u201d for Maher. \u201cI saw something that I felt like I had experience with,\u201d he explained. \u201cUltimately, I think I know a little more about what it\u2019s like to be overweight than perhaps some other people do. So, to see someone talk like that made me feel like, \u2018Well, this is something I feel like we should talk about.'\u201d So far, Corden\u2019s response has continued to garner a warm response, with the video of his comments racking up nearly two million views.\n\nThis is not the first time Maher has come under fire for controversial statements on a range of subjects; in 2017, he made a public apology after using a racial slur.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.", "description": "The 'Late Late Show' host had a heartfelt response to Bill Maher's insistence that fat-shaming should \"make a comeback.\"", "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/james-corden-bill-maher-fat-shaming.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
