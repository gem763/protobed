We\u2019ve got a good team spirit and camaraderie.\n\n\u2018It shows the character of the team. We get the games where we want them. We\u2019ve been leading 1-0 in many games and not kicked on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Today we were excellent, with fast flowing flowing. That\u2019s Manchester United. We\u2019re trying to get back to that.\n\n\u2018Marcus has that strike in him. I\u2019ve seen him in training so many times.\n\n\u2018When you give young lads the experience, like Brandon Williams got tonight \u2013 and the kid was outstanding \u2013 it\u2019s only going to help them.\n\nSolskjaer was not surprised by Rashford\u2019s strike (Picture: EPA)\n\n\u2018We know we\u2019re not the finished product, we\u2019re a work in progress and keep trying to improve.\u2019\n\nRashford, meanwhile, said his superb strike was aided by the balls used during the match.\n\n\u2018To be honest, it was the balls,\u2019 he said. \u2018When we were training with them and we were shooting there was this up and down motion and they can go anywhere.\n\n\u2018Thankfully, today it went in the top corner. It is a positive day.\u2019\n\nOn Manchester United\u2019s start to the season, Rashford added: \u2018We\u2019ve been in a tough place. We\u2019re still getting through that phase.\n\n\u2018The only way to get through it is to fight through it and win because they\u2019re the things which keep everyone happy. When you\u2019ve won, you wake up with a good feeling. The main focus was improvement and development.\u2019\n\nMORE: Jurgen Klopp threatens to pull Liverpool from the Carabao Cup after Arsenal win", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said Manchester United were 'excellent' during their hard-fought Carabao Cup victory over Chelsea.
