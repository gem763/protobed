Bush. Her nominal term expired more than a decade ago, but she has remained in the post as successive administrations have found it impossible to choose and confirm a successor.\n\nOn June 13, Weintraub originally posted a statement clarifying the illegality of candidates receiving election assistance from foreign governments after Trump told ABC News he would not alert the FBI if he was approached by a country such as Russia with damaging information about his 2020 opponent, and he would consider the information.\n\nEllen Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Commission, and President Trump (Photos: Paul Morigi/Getty Images, Win McNamee/Getty Images) More\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an interference, they have information \u2014 I think I\u2019d take it,\u201d Trump told ABC. \u201cIf I thought there was something wrong, I\u2019d go maybe to the FBI \u2014 if I thought there was something wrong. But when somebody comes up with oppo research, right, they come up with oppo research, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s call the FBI.\u2019 The FBI doesn\u2019t have enough agents to take care of it. When you go and talk, honestly, to congressmen, they all do it, they always have, and that\u2019s the way it is. It\u2019s called oppo research.\u201d\n\nCandidates often look for damaging information on their opponents, but generally from published stories, court papers or other domestic sources, not from foreign governments.\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s interview in June, Weintraub took the opportunity to remind the nation that what Trump had proposed doing violated U.S. law.\n\n\u201cLet me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office: It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election,\u201d Weintraub wrote. \u201cThis is not a novel concept.\u201c\n\nOn Thursday, Trump was again asked what he was specifically seeking on a July 25 call when he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for \u201ca favor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I would think if they were honest about it, they\u2019d start a major investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens because how does a company that\u2019s newly formed and all these companies, and by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine. So I would say with President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend they start an investigation into the Bidens, because nobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked.\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who has taken the lead on the impeachment inquiry against Trump, echoed Weintraub\u2019s warning.\n\nThe President cannot use the power of his office to pressure foreign leaders to investigate his political opponents.\n\n\n\nHis rant this morning reinforces the urgency of our work.\n\n\n\nAmerica is a Republic, if we can keep it. https://t.co/9KDCx1hVjs \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) October 3, 2019\n\nTrump has tasked Attorney General William Barr to reach out to several foreign governments to investigate the role U.S. intelligence agencies played in the 2016 presidential election as a way to counter the narrative that Trump was aided by Russian interference. Special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers for their efforts to promote Trump\u2019s candidacy, including hacking into and stealing files on a server used by the Democratic National Committee.\n\nJoe and Hunter Biden are not under investigation in the U.S.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "FEC chair Ellen Weintraub posted a reminder about U.S. election law following Trump's latest requests to foreign nations.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cYkXwAUrlnjZXtCP71Liwg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/a1c3a4a0-e601-11e9-ab39-c709fc485266"}
