Game 4 is Tuesday, also in Connecticut. Game 5, if necessary, would be Thursday in Washington.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, the first time the Mystics made it to the Finals, they were swept by the Seattle Storm.\n\nAD\n\nLongtime fans who stuck with the team during years when they\u2019d lose more than they\u2019d win say they can almost taste the championship.\n\nElena Delle Donne returns as Mystics top Sun, take 2-1 lead in WNBA Finals\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an investment of time, energy and heart, and it feels like it\u2019s coming to fruition fully. It\u2019s been a loooooooong road,\u201d said Rene Redwood, another founding fan and season ticket holder from the beginning.\n\nRedwood, 63, who lives on Capitol Hill, had tickets to Sunday\u2019s game in Connecticut but couldn\u2019t make it because of a time conflict with her work as a consultant.\n\nAfter the game Sunday, she was on the phone with clients trying to rearrange her schedule so she can attend the game Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one game away from a championship!\u201d she said.\n\nFans whooped and cheered at the big screen Sunday, and the crowd got a jolt of excitement early on when it was announced that team superstar Elena Delle Donne, who was named the league MVP in September, would play. Delle Donne had injured her back, and many expected her to sit out this game.\n\nAD\n\nJamie Howard, 25, who watched the game with his father, Kyland Howard, 65, stood and threw his arms in the air each time the Mystics scored. They\u2019ve been coming to the games together since Jamie Howard was a child.\n\nHis mother, Agnes Alexis, was a big fan and would bring the family to games often. When she died in 2003, father and son continued the tradition, in part in her memory, and in part because they fell in love with the games themselves.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was raised in it, my mom loved basketball, and it gave us something good to do in the summer,\u201d said Jamie Howard, a scientist who lives in Upper Marlboro.\n\nA championship would mean a lot, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a huge sports fan, but there\u2019s nothing that comes close to this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first sport I went to because of my mother. A win would be everything. Everything.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Howards are like many Mystics fans who have pulled on their red shirts and shown up dutifully to cheer on their team. They showed up game after game at what was then Verizon Center when the stands looked almost empty, and they followed the team to the brand new Entertainment and Sports Arena in Southeast Washington, which is smaller at 4,200 seats but is often at capacity.\n\nAD\n\nThe Mystics, in exchange, have loved their fans back through the years. They often play hard and smart, and the team made strategic changes, including acquiring phenom Delle Donne from the Chicago Sky.\n\nBut the Mystics have never been able to deliver what every loyal fan really wants: a title. That would be proof, they say, to the rest of the league \u2014 the rest of the world \u2014 that the Mystics are as fierce as their fans believe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like being a Cubs fan \u2014 there\u2019s only so long genuine affection will get you anywhere,\u201d said Jacky Hardy, 55, a Dunkirk resident who works for the federal government. \u201cAnd a win would give us bragging rights over some of the male teams in this town.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Washington fans watched the team take a 2-1 lead in the WNBA Finals against Connecticut on Sunday.", "authors": ["Allison Klein", "Anchor Of The Inspired Life Blog"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5elnwdVvKcuihp2-vS3eKkKOjNU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7544P4HIO4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
