Rival Walmart touts an annual fee of $98, while Target, via the Shipt app, charges $14 on an a la carte monthly charge, or $99 yearly for memberships.\n\nBut to get the great Amazon deal for free one- to two-hour food delivery, there's a catch. A big one.\n\nAmazon is offering free food delivery for Prime members. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nFree delivery, as of today, is available only to Prime members who have ordered food delivery in the past. Others need to request an invitation, a process that can take some time.\n\nWe requested an invitation for the Echo Auto device that brings Alexa to the car with our personal account when it was first unveiled in September 2018. It came through 11 months later.\n\nThe Echo Loop, a ring that answers to Alexa, was announced on Sept. 25, 2019, as an invitation only. We put in the request for this one as well, under a personal account, but have yet to be invited in.\n\nStephenie Landry, Amazon's vice-president of Grocery Delivery, would say only that she hopes to bring in customers \"as quickly as possible\" but wouldn't offer any specifics on how speedy that will be.\n\nShe added that grocery delivery is now one of the \"fastest-growing businesses\" at Amazon, and she predicted that along with shipping and entertainment, free food delivery will become one of Prime's most popular items.\n\nAmazon isn't as known for food ordering as it is for buying devices, books and household goods via its e-commerce system. It is testing small, 7-Eleven type Go stores in Seattle and other cities that use an app-based system to pay. Landry says Fresh's offerings are comparable to a full-size local retail supermarket.\n\nThe service is available in more than 2,000 cities, and Amazon says the one- to two-hour delivery is guaranteed in \"most\" cities Fresh operates in. \"We\u2019ll continue expanding ultrafast speeds to all cities where the service is available,\" Amazon said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/29/amazon-prime-members-now-get-free-food-delivery-whole-foods/2485468001/", "description": "Latest move from Amazon drops $14.99 monthly price, and puts pressure on competitors", "authors": ["Jefferson Graham", "Published A.M.
