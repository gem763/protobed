The ATO disagrees.\n\nIn November 2016, the ATO sought $2.7 million in over-claimed GST from Mr Zhou\u2019s Australian Coin Exchange. Meanwhile, two gold companies associated with Mr Wang received $76 million in tax bills.\n\nMr Zhou appointed a liquidator to Australian Coin Exchange in May 2017.\n\nWhen the gold-trading scandal was made public in June 2017 by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, together with his links to China\u2019s Communist Party, Mr Zhou was forced to resign his Labor Party job.\n\nUnfazed, just two months later he was campaigning hard to win a seat on Ryde Council as an independent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLess than a month later, Mr Zhou was elected to the council and told reporters the gold matter was now closed and he had \u201cnothing to explain and nothing to hide\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was never sued and never charged,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told The Australian: \u201cFirst of all I want to say this is nothing like a fraud, it is nothing like that, and the taxation office never said that the businesses ever had any fraud activity.\u201d\n\nMr Zhou said tax difficulties arose because of an \u201cunfortunate business mistake\u201d.\n\nLast December \u2013 after the ATO forced a change in liquidator for Mr Zhou\u2019s company Australian Coin Exchange \u2013 Vaughan Strawbridge of Deloitte said he was investigating possible recovery actions for \u201cunfair preference payments, insolvent trading, uncommercial transactions and \u2026 unreasonable director-related transactions\u201d.", "description": "In July 2017, Simon Zhou resigned from Labor's NSW headquarters.
