We are unsure if we will be able to fly.\n\n\"Although, it's ATOL-protected I have booked three weeks' leave from work and there's no guarantee that I will be able to get time off if I had to re-book.\" The Air Travel Organiser's Licence (ATOL) is a widespread protection scheme for UK travelers.\n\nIt was a similar story for Layton Roche and his fiance, who woke up on the day they were due to travel for their wedding on the Greek island of Kos.\n\n\"Needless to say I'm absolutely gutted,\" Roche tweeted early this morning. \"We literally woke up to go to the airport when we found out\".\n\n\"A couple of years of planning and a whole lot of money has gone down the drain,\" Roche told the Guardian.\n\n\"Dreams have been crushed.\"\n\nBritish tourists 'being held hostage' in Tunisian hotel after Thomas Cook collapse\n\nWhile many travelers have been unable to go on their dream vacations, many more are stranded overseas by the collapse.\n\nOne tourist in Tunisia told the BBC that he and fellow guests at a vacation resort in the country are \"being held hostage\" over fears Thomas Cook is no longer able to pay the hotel money it is owed.\n\nRyan Farmer told the BBC that the Les Orangers resort in Hammamet in Tunisia demanded money from Thomas Cook guests, and barricaded the resort's gates.\n\nHe said when the guests refused to pay they were prevented from leaving the hotel by security guards.\n\n\"We've been up to the gates, they had four security guards on the gates, holding the gates closed, and were not allowing anybody to leave,\" Farmer said.\n\nRead More: The UK expects to spend \u00a3100 million flying back stranded Thomas Cook passengers, which is only \u00a350 million less than bailing out the company\n\nMany passengers were also left stranded across the world after Thomas Cook cancelled flights.\n\nJoshua Speer is waiting to return to the UK from Turkey, but said that it has been nearly impossible to get information from the company over how guests will be brought home.\n\nAfter sending a message to the company's help service on WhatsApp, he received an automated response informing him that: \"The UK business has ceased trading with immediate effect and all future flights and vacations are cancelled.\"\n\nThe message detailed that \"a dedicated support service is being provided by The Civil Aviation Authority,\" but there was no information given on when or how this support would come into effect, he said.\n\nOthers were yet to travel but reported how cancelled flights and vacations booked through Thomas Cook have caused them to lose out on money.\n\nIan Campbell tweeted that he had to cancel an entire vacation after the return flight was cancelled by Thomas Cook.\n\nHe said his flight was not protected by ATOL, and not protected by insurance as he was yet to travel.\n\n\"We can't afford \u00a33000 more to fly with another carrier,\" he said.\n\nFormer Thomas Cook employees have also been left devastated by the news they have lost their jobs over night.\n\nOne staff member, Lucy, tweeted on Monday to say she was \"devastated beyond words\" at the news.\n\nDespite the fact the company said it is halting operations, the now unemployed travel agent said she would be at her branch at 9:00 a.m to help customers with any questions.", "description": "Passengers affected by the closure of Thomas Cook share stories of financial loss, cancelled weddings and being \"held hostage\" by a hotel in Tunisia.", "authors": ["Sahar Esfandiari"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88a9ef2e22af106a0ffbf3-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
