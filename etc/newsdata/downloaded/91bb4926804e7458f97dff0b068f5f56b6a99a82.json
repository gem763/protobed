Many villagers who worked outside have returned to help develop tourism and offer tourists rural homestay services.\n\nAt the end of 2015, locals in Shenlongwan village had rid themselves of poverty thanks to the tourism boom driven by the road. The village received 300,000 visitors in 2017 with tourism revenue amounting to 50 million yuan ($7.72 million).\n\nA flight of steps on cliffs used in the past by villagers in Shenlongwan village to go to the county seat, Changzhi city, Shanxi province, June 13 [Photo/Xinhua]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20180621/286ed488c8281c957cd801.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-21"}
