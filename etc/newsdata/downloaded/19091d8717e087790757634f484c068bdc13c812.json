Plagued by toxic stereotypes which condition men to relentlessly pump iron while women avoid lifting weights out of fear of bulking up, it\u2019s no surprise that so many of us are getting it wrong when we work out.\n\nIt can be particularly tricky for women, who are fed a Victoria\u2019s Secret narrative of beauty from a young age which presents a slim and toned physique as the ultimate goal, exacerbating anxieties about becoming 'too muscly'.\n\nPlus, personal trainers can be expensive, leaving many of us turning to Instagram for guidance, copying fitness influencers with no formal training which may lead to poor form and injuries.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Not lifting heavy weights\n\nWhile the physical benefits of lifting weights as a woman are well-documented, Vertue stresses the psychological value too and argues that not enough women are making the most of the weights room in gyms.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much empowerment you can get from picking up heavy things,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cOften women are told to lift these tiny pink dumbbells which is ridiculous - have you ever lifted a woman\u2019s handbag?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much heavier than what a man carries, which is essentially just his wallet and his phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have the strength, we\u2019re carrying a kid in one arm and a laptop in the other.\n\n\u201cWomen need to be stronger than they\u2019ve been told in the past.\u201d\n\n2. Wasting time trying to \u2018spot reduce\u2019\n\nAll you have to do is search \u2018how to get abs\u2019 on Google to see the extent at which we are sold the myth that one simple set of exercises will give us chiselled abs.\n\nOr, you could type \u2018how to get perky glutes\u2019 for a similar stream of false promises.\n\nTrying to target fat loss in certain body parts, or \u2018spot reducing\u2019, as it\u2019s known, is not possible, explains Vertue.\n\n\u201cWe need to think about the body as a whole. If you only have a little bit of time, you want to choose compound movements: squats, lunges and push-ups.\n\n\u201cThese will work your entire body and mean you will have to work out for less time,\u201d she explains.\n\n3. Taking advice from unqualified people\n\nThanks to the advent of social media, everyone with a smartphone and a sports bra can fancy themselves as a fitness influencer.\n\nWhile Instagram can be a useful tool for PTs to build their personal brand, there\u2019s nothing stopping Jane Doe from telling thousands of followers to \u2018burpee till the cows come home\u2019 without so much as a personal training qualification.\n\nA lot of the time, when we copy routines posted on the \u2018gram, we\u2019re doing them wrong, Vertue says.\n\nNot only could this lead to injury, but she explains that incorrect form can change the way it affects your body from an aesthetic point of view.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to pay attention to form because how you actually move is going to make a difference to the aesthetic that you build,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cFor example, if you\u2019re doing an overhead press and using your traps, you\u2019re going to build big muscles on top of your shoulders.\n\n\u201cHowever, if you do it properly, you\u2019re going to sculpt the areas you want to.\u201d\n\nShona Vertue has partnered with AXA PPP healthcare to launch their 2018 Flying Start campaign for National Fitness Day.
