This was bound to happen at one time or another\u2014 and, if I had to guess, the reveal would have been accidental \u2014 but it\u2019s happening after only three half-hour episodes of the show, which deliberately shuts down what might have been a rich source of screwball comedy and metaphysical observation. It\u2019s not like, say, the Michael Keaton movie Multiplicity is some kind of masterpiece, but it did exploit the premise for laughs. Living With Yourself plainly has a separate agenda.\n\nWhat makes it lamentable \u2014 or what makes it seem lamentable, anyway \u2014 is the fun of watching the two versions of Miles work together in some respects and deviate in others. When Miles 2.0 opts not to skedaddle to the tropics as planned, the timing turns out to be surprisingly good for Miles, who\u2019s utterly confused about the expectations that he\u2019s set at work and at home and needs help connecting the dots. It\u2019s like the classic episode of Seinfeld where George misses the details of a project and has to ask his boss and others questions that might give him some insight into what, exactly, he\u2019s supposed to be doing. (At one point, he and Jerry sit in a diner, scanning for clues from the lyrics of Petula Clark\u2019s \u201cDowntown.\u201d) They need each other to be a single plausible person \u2014 or at least the inferior Miles needs a boost from his more inspired double.\n\nAs with the last episode, \u201cGreen Tea\u201d circles back to a moment in an earlier episode for a change of perspective, this time passing the baton \u2014 in the form of a wedding ring \u2014 from Miles 2.0 to original-flavor Miles. Miles is grateful to have his life back, but his relief doesn\u2019t last long: In just half a day, Miles 2.0 has set a standard for competence and charisma far higher than he\u2019s capable of reaching. Miles returns to work the conquering hero for his winning pitch on the Hillston account, but now comes the hard work of realizing a vision that didn\u2019t originate with him and that he honestly finds a little cheesy. The better version of him has sketches of farm animals with slogans attached, but that\u2019s not enough for Miles to fake his way through meetings successfully, especially with the big pitch to Hillston on the horizon.\n\nStill, Miles figures correctly that he has Miles 2.0 over a barrel. He\u2019ll agree to step in at work and certain domestic situations because \u201cyou want your old life back and you\u2019d take whatever crumb you can get.\u201d And so Miles creates an exciting opportunity for himself: He can send Miles 2.0 to excel at the stuff he doesn\u2019t like, such as working his day job and entertaining guests with his wife, and he can dust off the play he\u2019d always wanted to complete. Both are still conscientious enough to leave the intimacies with Kate exclusively to old Miles, so pecks on the cheek before work and a lovemaking session after the party is his terrain. It doesn\u2019t seem doable in the long term because Miles 2.0 will naturally want more of what Miles has, but when they enter into this arrangement, neither of them seem to realize how quickly it will go south.\n\nBefore then, however, \u201cGreen Tea\u201d makes some good observations about what we might actually do with the free time we fantasize about. Writing a play sounds like an appealing idea, a return to the cooler and more creative self that he\u2019d abandoned for a career in marketing. But it turns out writing is hard. What\u2019s easier, from the second day and beyond, is indulging in the most popular forms of 21st-century time-wasting: watching funny pet videos and pornography on the internet and playing a Candy Crush variant on his phone. (True confession: Your humble freelance recapper is currently on Level 4,863 of Candy Crush. It is my greatest achievement.) Miles also takes to a little day-drinking, too. Why not? What does he have to stay sober for?\n\nNevertheless, it eats at him at Miles 2.0 is getting all the laughs and plaudits while he\u2019s AirPlay-ing porn on his flatscreen. So he decides to prove his meddle by studying up on the Hillston pitch and making the presentation to the old man himself. He fumbles badly, but not enough to sink the account. It\u2019s his conversation after the meeting with Hillston that adds a crucial ethical component to what he\u2019s doing. Hillston recognizes that Miles\u2019s pitch didn\u2019t come from him, and he tells a story about essentially condemning another child to death in a concentration camp by claiming he stole a ration when, in fact, it was young Hillston who\u2019s done the stealing. Frankly, the shock value of a story like that knocks Living With Yourself off balance, but Hillston\u2019s words have a chilling resonance nonetheless: \u201cI don\u2019t mind a cheater,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to cheat, do it right. However you came up with that campaign of yours, don\u2019t stop.\u201d In the rush to get ahead in life and business, he implies, nothing is off limits.\n\nAnd so when Miles 2.0 follows him around in a station wagon and smashes his driver\u2019s side door to enjoy his victory lap at Fridays, Miles decides that the two are officially at war. He\u2019s not interested in continuing to siphon ideas from his superior self, as Hillston suggests, but in sabotaging the entire charade. The episode ends with Miles finishing Miles 2.0\u2019s joke, the one that got a big laugh at Kate\u2019s house party, and with that, the jig is officially up. It\u2019s an impulsive act, with no real consideration of the consequences. Miles just feels like his doppelg\u00e4nger is getting the better of him, and this evens the score.\n\nDouble Yous\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s not clear how either Miles thought they could get away with the money missing from a shared bank account. I was under the impression that Miles was drawing from a secret account to pay for the procedure, but that appears not to be the case. So he\u2019d be in trouble with Kate sooner or later.\n\n\u2022 The episode gets its name from the contrast between Miles\u2019s standard drink order, a Coke, and Miles 2.0\u2019s healthier choice of green tea. Miles tries to change his order, but the show implies that he cannot fight his true nature.\n\n\u2022 Good to see the seasoned and talented Alia Shawkat as Miles\u2019s half-sister, who knew about his double because Miles 2.0 has been keeping in touch. (And has been much better about supporting her work.) It\u2019s not clear yet what role she will play in the narrative, but she\u2019s a (mostly) nonjudgmental presence in Miles and Miles 2.0\u2019s life, and thus a place for him to retreat.\n\n\u2022 \u201cWhat do you think of the teal?\u201d \u201cWhat are you, a magician?\u201d\n\n\u2022 If you pause over Miles\u2019s play, it will confirm your suspicion that it\u2019s terrible. The stage directions involve a computer screen projected over him with words like \u201cARTISTRY,\u201d \u201cGENIUS\u201d and \u201cFAILURE.\u201d The first line: \u201cI think it was Matisse who said, \u2018Creativity takes courage.\u2019 If that\u2019s true, I\u2019m screwed.\u201d There is no second line.\n\n\u2022 Shawkat\u2019s line about Miles being jealous of his doppelg\u00e4nger (\u201cYou are making incredible advances in the field of feeling sorry for yourself\u201d) makes me suspect that the show is abandoning the secret co-existence of Miles and Miles 2.0 too early, but perhaps it\u2019s anxious to turn the page for a reason.\n\nVULTURE NEWSLETTER Keep up with all the drama of your favorite shows!
