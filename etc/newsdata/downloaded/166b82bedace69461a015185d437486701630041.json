I thought it might make me seem a bit quirky and announce me to my people. But it\u2019s none of these things. Birding, actually, is a perfectly good way to ruin a nice walk.\n\nThis is because, although birds are everywhere, they are total jerks about it. Their favourite thing to do is to come and sit in a tree sort of near you and call loudly for the exact amount of time it takes you to get your binoculars up to your eyes and focused. And, at that moment, what they like best is to fly behind some leaves. They like to do this over and over. Between you and the sun.\n\nAustralia's birds: pretty and sweet or just a pack of bastards? | Sean Dooley Read more\n\nThere was a time in my life when this wouldn\u2019t have bothered me because I simply wouldn\u2019t have been looking. I spent the first three decades of my life not even knowing that I was routinely walking right past birds I had never even seen before. Back then, birds weren\u2019t yet deliberately evading me; they were simply hiding in plain sight from eyes and ears that had been trained by a lifetime of city dwelling to slide over them without noticing.\n\nI let birds into my life accidentally when I stopped one day to read an interpretive sign along the Yarra in Ivanhoe. Apparently, on my daily walk, I could hope to see white-faced herons, eastern yellow robins and red-browed firetails. I thought I may as well look out for these creatures seeing as I was there already and, lo and behold \u2026 I beheld them. In the bushes, perching on trees next to the track, hopping in the grass and picking their way through the water in stately slow-mo. They had been there all along and I just hadn\u2019t noticed. Now, without being weirdly obsessive about it, I can\u2019t help but keep noticing. And it makes for a really stiff neck sometimes.\n\nSometimes I wonder why I even like birds. They\u2019re pretty and they fly but that\u2019s not it\n\nAt first, I tried birding with other people. I dragged my husband along on a beginners\u2019 birdwatching walk where a group of people spent a solid 10 minutes trying to point out something called a bronzewing that everyone but me could see. It was a situation that became more awkward the longer it went on. People were standing behind me, their chins near my shoulder, pointing past my ear and giving very precise directions: \u201cThere\u2019s a big gum at 12 o\u2019clock \u2026 come down in front to the right \u2026 there\u2019s a log \u2026 about five meters in front \u2026 on the ground \u2026 can you see it?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d I said every time I was asked some variation of that question. I wanted to pretend to see the bronzewing but I couldn\u2019t lie to these people. I wanted the stupid bird to fly away so I wouldn\u2019t have the pressure of having to see it. None of these things happened. These nice people just continued to be bizarrely patient with me. Finally, in exasperation, I cried out: \u201cUnless it\u2019s a pigeon, I can\u2019t see anything!\u201d There was uproar.\n\nThis is only funny if you know birds. Because a bronzewing is a kind of pigeon. Who knew? I couldn\u2019t see it because I didn\u2019t know what I was looking for and, even when I was looking right at it, all I could see was \u201cjust a pigeon\u201d. So. That was embarrassing.\n\nAfter that, I decided that birdwatching in a group wasn\u2019t for me. The pressure of having to see a large bird waddling around in plain sight was just too much.\n\nI couldn\u2019t really help seeing birds when other people were around though and I couldn\u2019t hide the excitement that comes with witnessing a particular species for the first time. Among the ecology crowd I tended to hang with, it was suggested to me that I might be something called a twitcher. But this observation sometimes came with a slightly disapproving tone. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a list, do you?\u201d someone once asked me. To ask me if I have a list is like asking somebody who is really well known for having something if they have that thing. \u201cPffft. NO!\u201d I lied. And a few weeks later, so early in my birding journey, and with so few species \u201cticked off\u201d, I retired my little blue book to the back of a drawer.\n\nI still didn\u2019t know much about birds but I liked them quite a lot. So when a lecturer known for his avian research asked a class I was in: \u201cIs anyone here a birdwatcher?\u201d I proudly raised my hand. \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d he said to me with a distinct note of compassion. WTF? He was the bird guy. What was this? For I while, I went with \u201cbirdo\u201d to describe my, again, not weirdly obsessive interest in birds. But that moniker, it turns out, raises expectations that you know stuff. More pressure.\n\nThe ibis was here first. Now it's just doing what it needs to do to survive | Erin Lennox Read more\n\nIn an attempt to evade whatever the hell is going on in the politics of birdwatching nomenclature I have coined a new term for myself: \u201cNoticer of birds\u201d. It\u2019s casual enough that I get out of having to distinguish an intermediate egret* from a great egret. Although, if I do manage to tell the difference, I\u2019ll be ticking it off.\n\nSometimes I wonder why I even like birds. They\u2019re pretty and they fly but that\u2019s not it. I think it\u2019s because they do so many things that we think of as important to being human. They build amazing structures \u2013 often ingeniously (and without hands). Anyone who has ever seen a bower knows that they create art. They dance. They can talk. They can problem-solve. They care diligently for their offspring. Mostly. They even use fire.\n\nNo matter what you think of birds, it\u2019s probably true to say that they are more interesting than you realise. At the very least, they are worth noticing.\n\n*Possibly not its real name.\n\n\u2022 Erin Lennox lives in Melbourne.
