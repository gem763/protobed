And he has developed a kind of bromance with Brees, the Super Bowl winner who gave him a framed jersey that said, \u201cTo Zion \u2014 Passing the torch to you!\u201d For this summer\u2019s ESPY Awards, Brees dressed his three sons in maroon tuxedos almost identical to the one that Williamson wore.\n\nFootball\u2019s imprimatur has been more than enough to persuade Pelicans fans. An estimated 10,000 showed up for a public practice. The team has sold more than 12,000 season-ticket packages, a franchise record. Its lone home preseason game drew an announced sellout of 17,954. There were empty seats but no vacant enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that would come close for me to what we\u2019re experiencing with Zion would be David Robinson getting out of the Navy and coming to San Antonio,\u201d said Pelicans Coach Alvin Gentry, who was an assistant with the Spurs in the 1989-90 season.\n\nNew Orleans is not a place that expects perfection. It is patient and willing to grant second chances. It stuck by the Saints through 20 consecutive nonwinning seasons as an expansion franchise. But just as this city knows how to put out the welcome mat, it knows how to hold a grudge, even if playfully.\n\nAfter a referee\u2019s blown pass-interference call during the N.F.C. championship game in January probably kept the Saints out of the Super Bowl, the town held a Boycott Bowl parade and concert. Less gleefully, a Saints fan filed a lawsuit against the N.F.L. that reached the state supreme court in Louisiana before being dismissed.\n\nSo when Davis asked to be traded, and then was after last season, it was no surprise that feelings were hurt. To hear fans tell it, it was not just that Davis left, but the way he left \u2014 wearing a \u201cThat\u2019s all folks!\u201d T-shirt to his final game in New Orleans.\n\n\u201cWe might be \u2018the City that Care Forgot,\u2019 but it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t care,\u201d said Rick Sanchez, a Pelicans season-ticket holder. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave us high and dry. You don\u2019t want to be with us, we don\u2019t want to be with you.\u201d", "description": "Williamson is the most-hyped N.B.A. rookie since LeBron James, but an injury will delay his Pelicans debut.", "authors": ["Jer\u00e9 Longman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/sports/22nba-zion-feature-1/22nba-zion-feature-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
