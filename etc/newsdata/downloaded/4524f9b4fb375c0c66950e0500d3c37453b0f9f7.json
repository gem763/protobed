So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom and trying to be a newlywed,\" Meghan told Britain's ITV anchor Tom Bradby in a documentary film, \"Harry & Meghan: An African Journey,\" about their recently concluded 10-day tour of southern Africa.\n\nMeghan, 38, talked for the first time in public about what it's been like coping with a fierce and often critical media spotlight since she and Harry, 35, got engaged in November 2017, married in May 2018 and gave birth to baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor on May 6.\n\n\"And also thank you for asking, because not many people will have asked if I'm OK,\" Meghan told Bradby. \"But it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\"\n\nThe ITV film of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's tour of southern Africa with Archie will air Sunday in the United Kingdom and on Wednesday in the U.S. on ABC (10 p.m. E.T.), which picked up the project and is promoting it with excerpts and press releases.\n\nBradby is a familiar journalist to the young royals: He did the first interview with Prince William and the former Kate Middleton after they announced their engagement in 2010.\n\nAccording to ABC, Bradby asked Meghan about whether it's been a \"struggle\" to adjust to life in the public eye as a new royal. Meghan quickly answered \"yes,\" and added that it's especially difficult to handle the pressure while pregnant and as a new mom.\n\nPrince Harry, Duchess Meghan of Sussex and their baby, Archie, in Cape Town, South Africa, on Sept. 25, 2019.

Is he now at peace? Harry said her death is still a \"wound that festers.\"\n\n\"I think (of) being part of this family, in this role, in this job every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash,\" Harry said. \"It takes me straight back, so in that respect it\u2019s the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best.\"\n\nMeghan and Harry spoke to Bradby earlier in the Africa tour. On Oct. 1, the eve of the final day of the tour, news broke that the couple had filed separate lawsuits in the U.K. against three tabloids and their parent companies for alleged copyright infringement, invasion of privacy and phone hacking.\n\nFor their first engagement together after their Africa trip, Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan of Sussex attended the annual WellChild Awards in London on Oct.15, 2019.

I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\"\n\nHarry's lawsuit against The Sun and The Daily Mirror alleges illegal hacking of his phone voicemail, recently discovered but dating back years.\n\nMeghan's lawsuit is aimed at the Mail on Sunday, which published in February an anguished letter she wrote to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, after he missed the wedding. Her suit argues that this is a violation of copyright law, which holds that the contents of a private letter belong to the writer, not to the recipient.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/18/meghan-markle-prince-harry-itv-interview-royal-couple-talks-backlash/4021100002/", "description": "Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan talk to a British ITV journalist about their struggles with media coverage.", "authors": ["Maria Puente", "Published P.M.
