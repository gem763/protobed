Firefighters arrived within minutes to find the mobile home engulfed in flames. Mr Ruestman had ruled that the fire was intentionally set.\n\nKathryn Murray, 69, Jason Wall, 34, and two-year-olds Rose Alwood and Daemeon Wall and one-year-old Ariel Wall died due to smoke inhalation, according to post mortems.\n\nTwo people survived the fire, including Mr Wall\u2019s fiancee Katrina Alwood and her young son.\n\nMs Alwood and Mr Wall were the parents of Ariel and Daemeon Wall. Rose Alwood was a niece, and Ms Murray was Ms Alwood\u2019s grandmother.\n\nThe state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office did not disclose whether the nine-year-old suspect knew the victims.\n\nMr Minger said an arrest warrant will not be issued for the child, and he\u2019s not certain whether there is a minimum age threshold for imprisoning a minor. Instead, he will be appointed an attorney and brought before a judge for a bench trial. No jury will be present, and jail time is not possible; if found guilty, the child could face a minimum of five years of probation, along with counselling and therapy, according to Mr Minger.\n\nHe told the Journal Star that \u201cprobation, given the age, is about the only outcome that could happen here.\u201d\n\nThe charges are among several recent high profile cases in the US involving children under 10 years old, according to data collected by ABC News.\n\nMore than 30,000 children aged under 10 were arrested in the US within the last six years, according to annual crime statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThirty-four states don\u2019t have a minimum age for delinquency, and 24 states have no minimum age requirement to send juvenile cases to criminal court.\n\nLast month, two six-year-olds were arrested in Florida for kicking a school staff member, and in August, a 10-year-old boy was charged with aggravated assault for throwing a ball into another child\u2019s face during a dodgeball game.\n\nRead more\n\nBiden breaks silence to call for Trump's impeachment for first time\n\nRihanna slams Trump as 'most mentally ill person in America'\n\nLindsey Graham attacks Trump for \u2018shamelessly abandoning\u2019 the Kurds\n\nTrump lawyer Rudy Giuliani performs bizarre impression of Cory Booker\n\nTrump accused of 26 new cases of \u2018unwanted sexual contact\u2019", "description": "A nine-year-old in Illinois has been charged with five counts of first-degree murder following a deadly mobile home fire that killed five people, including three children, the youngest of whom was one year old.The child also was charged on Tuesday with two counts of arson and one count of aggravated", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/l6H1PA_C1hRZQXbJ0qpWBg--~B/aD0zNTA7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/378fa373477a84cd83c8dc55ba69ff7e", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
