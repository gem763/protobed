We can all relate.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution? You can start by packing your shelves and refrigerator with a few staples that are low on effort and big on flavor. In our pantry, canned black beans, limes and a few key condiments and spices are near the top of the list.\n\n[Sign up for Voraciously\u2019s Plant Powered newsletter here]\n\nThis plant-based taco recipe is a lesson in minimalism: You\u2019ll be surprised at the amount of flavor achieved from a few humble ingredients in just 20 minutes.\n\nOur favorite trick for cooking black beans is with a little can liquid, spices and a hint of Dijon mustard for complexity. What takes them over the top is a crunchy, tart two-onion quick pickle. And if you like a little kick, put that hot sauce to use.\n\nSpanish smoked paprika (piment\u00f3n) brings a noticeable flair to plant-based dishes and is worth the investment. You can find it in the spice aisle in the grocery store. It is not interchangeable with sweet paprika or Hungarian paprika.\n\nMake Ahead: Refrigerate leftover black bean filling and pickled onions for up to 2 days; reheat the black beans on the stove top.\n\nThis recipe is from Week 1 of Voraciously\u2019s Plant Powered newsletter series.

Let them stand for about 2 minutes to extract their raw flavor, then drain.\n\nStep 2\n\nCombine the lime juice, the rinsed red onions and scallions, and a pinch of kosher salt in a small jar or liquid measuring cup. Let stand while you make the remainder of the recipe, or for at least 10 minutes.\n\nStep 3\n\nOn to the black beans: Heat the oil until shimmering in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining red onion and cook without stirring for about 3 minutes, until lightly browned. Add the black beans with their liquid, the chili powder, cumin, Spanish smoked paprika, Dijon mustard and 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt; stir to incorporate. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid reduces to a thick sauce and your kitchen smells heavenly.\n\nStep 4\n\nWe like to add a bit of flavor and lovely char marks while warming our tortillas (not required, but highly recommended). Place a tortilla right on the grate above the flame of a gas burner, then cook on medium heat for a few seconds per side, flipping with tongs, until lightly blackened on the edges. Repeat for all tortillas.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a gas range, arrange the tortillas in a single layer on a baking sheet and broil for about 1 minute per side.\n\nStep 5\n\nTo assemble the tacos, place some chopped romaine at the center of each tortilla, then add a large spoonful of the black bean mixture. Top with the pickled onions and hot sauce, if using. If desired, you can pour a small splash of the lime juice from the onion pickles onto each taco (but be conservative or you\u2019ll have a watery taco).\n\nFrom Sonja Overhiser and Alex Overhiser of ACoupleCooks.com.\n\nTested by Sonja Overhiser and Alex Overhiser; email questions to voraciously@washpost.com.\n\nScale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here.\n\nDid you make this recipe?
