China is still a country of forced abortions. It\u2019s a country of open, systematic, state-led ethnic and religious persecution. It\u2019s a country of social censorship. It\u2019s a country of Kafkaesque social policy: millions of Chinese people who were born illegally as second or third children have no right to education or work, and some do not even have their births registered.\n\nI think Americans actually would show some understanding and patience with NBA players and personalities that remained discreetly silent. The league\u2019s lucrative involvement in China dates to a time when hopes for China\u2019s liberalization seemed more realistic. And the league\u2019s players may be correct in calculating that any protests against Chinese human-rights abuses from them would not have any salutary effect on China, and could possibly have an adverse one, making Hong Kongers look like subjects of American intrigue rather than genuine interest.\n\nBut LeBron\u2019s political self-regard, his financial interests, and his silence simply paint a damning picture.", "description": "", "authors": ["M.B.
