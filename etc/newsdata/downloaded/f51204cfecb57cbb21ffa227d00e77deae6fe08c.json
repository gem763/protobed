It was unclear if the new disclosure would change the thinking of any of the parties that agreed to the settlement.\n\nThe attorneys general of a majority of states, including New York and Massachusetts, have already balked at the proposed deal, contending that the Sackler family has siphoned off company profits that should be used to pay for the billions of dollars in damage caused by opioids.\n\nThe wire transfers are part of a lawsuit against Purdue and individual Sacklers in New York. Letitia James, now the state\u2019s attorney general, had issued subpoenas last month to 33 financial institutions and investment advisers with ties to the Sacklers in an effort to trace the full measure of the family\u2019s wealth.", "description": "In a court filing, the state attorney general\u2019s office says that it has found new account transfers by members of the family that owns Purdue Pharma, the maker of opioids.", "authors": ["Danny Hakim"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/14/science/14SACKLER-print/13SACKLER1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
