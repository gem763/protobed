(We) cannot do it just once, because parliament is deaf,\u201d read a placard being held up by one protester who had climbed a tree.\n\nMore than 20,000 police and military personnel were deployed to maintain security in the capital on Monday, according to media.\n\nStudents also staged protests in the cities of Yogyakarta and Solo in central Java.\n\nLast week, Widodo said he would consider revoking the KPK law and ordered police restraint after the death of two student protesters, one of whom died of bullet wounds, according to police.\n\nSandi Saputra Pulungan, an activist with the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi), a green group, said the protests would continue until all of their demands were met.\n\n\u201cWe see that in Indonesia, our democracy is in danger. It\u2019s as though we\u2019re not in a democracy, but rather we are returning to the era of the New Order,\u201d Pulungan said, referring to the 32-year rule of the late president Suharto, who used the army to maintain tight control and contain opposition.\n\nA list of student demands has been circulated on social media, which alongside opposing the new laws, includes stopping forest fires and removing a heavy military presence in the restive easternmost area of Papua.", "description": "Indonesia's parliament on Monday officially agreed to delay to a next term a vote on a criminal code that bans sex outside marriage and penalizes insulting the president's honor as protests against the bill entered a second week.", "authors": ["Agustinus Beo Da Costa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
