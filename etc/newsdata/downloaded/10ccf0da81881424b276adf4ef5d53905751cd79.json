This is already one of the most vibrant areas in the city, with a mix of upscale restaurants, fast-casual eateries, waterfront bars, attractive outdoor parks and gleaming new condo buildings. During the playoffs, the neighborhood has been filled with those holding precious game tickets and those, lured by an unseen force, who just want to bask in the glory.\n\n\u201cFor home games, we\u2019re very busy,\u201d says Jeremy Gifford, the owner of Walters Sports Bar, located across N Street SE from the ballpark. \u201cFor away games, we\u2019ve been even busier.\u201d And this weekend? \u201cWe\u2019re expecting to be at capacity starting at noon\u201d on Friday, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at capacity since Day One of the playoff run.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith tens of thousands expected to descend on the area around Yards Park for city-led pep rallies, viewing parties and, of course, the games, bars have to do more than make sure the keg room is full and they have enough bartenders: They\u2019re stockpiling napkins and toilet paper, hiring extra security to handle huge crowds and making plans to have a truck full of ice on hand.\n\nThe Budweiser Clydesdales are expected to arrive at Mission Navy Yard, a two-level restaurant and bar, at 7 a.m. Friday, where Fox 5 will be broadcasting live. Around 11 a.m., the restaurant will begin serving brunch with bottomless chips, margaritas, bloody marys and Dos Equis. From there, says owner Fritz Brogan, it will just get crazier. Even though Mission has hundreds of seats, waits of an hour and a half to two hours have been common during the playoffs. On Wednesday night, a crowd of thirsty patrons was two rows deep around the 150-foot bar, with many sipping from glasses of Mission\u2019s signature margaritas. And that is what Brogan is worried about.\n\nBefore the World Series, he says, he asked his landlord for permission to keep a refrigerated van full of ice in the building\u2019s loading dock, just to make sure bartenders don\u2019t run out. \u201cWe have big ice machines, but they can\u2019t keep up\u201d when you\u2019ve got a full house of people drinking from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m., \u201cand we can\u2019t get delivery because of the road closures.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNationals Park has hosted major events before \u2014 the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby last summer, the NHL Winter Classic in 2015, Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 tour \u2014 that led to major spillover for the bars and restaurants in surrounding blocks. But this is different: The passion is palpable, and not just during the \u201cLET\u2019S GO NATS\u201d chants that ring out at Bluejacket or the Bullpen.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is kind of surreal,\u201d says Paul Holder, one of the owners of the Salt Line, the seafood restaurant across from the first base gate. \u201cIt\u2019s been an exciting thing to watch up close.\u201d (The Salt Line\u2019s ownership includes Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, and the team brought the National League Championship Series trophy to the restaurant after sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much wanting to be a part of this\u201d in the city, Holder says. \u201cThat\u2019s different from the casual interest in the All-Star Game. Just to be down here is something special for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Capitol Riverfront Business Improvement District certainly hopes so. Friday at 6 p.m. in Yards Park, the BID kicks off \u201cWatch Party Weekend\u201d with a pep rally starring the Eastern High Marching Band, lawn games, food and drinks and live bands, followed by a viewing of Game 3 on a 18-foot LED screen.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, the party moves to the Yards Lot, the grassy expanse at the corner of M Street and New Jersey Avenue SE. The BID has held pep rallies for Nationals playoff games before, explains BID communications director Bonnie Trein, but this one \u201cis different than what we\u2019ve done in the past. Those were in the early rounds,\u201d and there was less excitement. Around 4,000 can fit in Yards Park, Trein says, while the capacity at the Yards Lot is 8,000. (As a point of reference, around 11,500 people live in the neighborhood, Trein says.)\n\nMost bars and restaurants near the park will be first-come, first-seated this weekend, but some enterprising fans managed to make sure they can experience as much of the atmosphere as possible. Walters uses Open Table to manage its restaurant reservations, and to prevent people from scoring tables for large groups, Gifford says the ability to make reservations was suspended before Nationals won the pennant. Still, he says, some fans got through early enough to make reservations for Friday, starting at noon, \u201cwith notes saying that they were going to stay until they were going to the game,\u201d Gifford says. He\u2019ll honor those reservations \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re allowed to drag people out of their seats\u201d \u2014 but won\u2019t take any others, even though he\u2019s being bombarded with requests via email and social media.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore he worries about that, however, he has to go buy some flowers for the boxes outside Walters. \u201cThis is going to be a weekend where the eyes on the District of Columbia are going to be magnified,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to look good.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE\n\nAD", "description": "Bars near Nationals Park are opening early and bracing for big crowds as D.C. hosts its first World Series game since 1933.", "authors": ["Fritz Hahn", "Reporter Covering Bars", "Drinks", "Nightlife For The Washington Post'S Weekend Section"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wuYLOP5vBml5pkImEzpNfLtlYWU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VB44JNDRRZC5FIRSB7VS2KXI74", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
