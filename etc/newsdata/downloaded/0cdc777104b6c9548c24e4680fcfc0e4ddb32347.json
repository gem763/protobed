That life was putting me in a kind of isolation, and I began to think, I have to resist against that because I am going crazy. So I had a need to paint the wall, just to do something against it.\u201d\n\nMore than four decades after the Frenchman became one of the first artists to paint on the infamous barrier, he is preparing to decorate another section of wall in Britain to mark next month\u2019s 30th anniversary of its fall. He and Stik, a London-based street artist who paints often enormous, expressive stick figures, will paint and install two original sections of the wall, which for a month will greet visitors outside the Imperial War Museum in south London.\n\nBut while the three-metre slabs of reinforced concrete have become museum pieces or lucrative collectors\u2019 items, Noir has cautioned younger generations not to be complacent about the freedoms that he and others assumed the fall of the Wall would usher in.\n\n\u201cThirty years ago, we were thinking, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s freedom on Earth, everything will be better now,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cBut it\u2019s not, it\u2019s the opposite. In 30 years, many, many walls have gone up since. This is a message to the young generation. Do not repeat the mistakes of your parents.\u201d\n\nWhen he first started painting, Noir said, Berliners were shocked and suspicious. \u201cMy neighbours asked me a lot of questions \u2013 who gave you the money for this? Are you a spy from France?\u201d So persistent were those challenging him, he said, that he changed his style of painting \u201cso it was possible to talk and paint at the same time\u201d, developing an instantly recognisable motif of \u201cbig heads, three colours and black lines all around\u201d that came to be synonymous with the Wall itself.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thierry Noir repainting part of the original Berlin Wall in 2009 outside the Wende Museum in Los Angeles.

Did the art itself help to usher in its fall? \u201cI think so,\u201d said Noir, \u201cbecause the special art on borders helps to [highlight] that border, and to say, \u2018This is not normal to have this in our country.\u2019\u201d It was, he says, \u201ca mutation of art\u201d.\n\nWalls are frequently called something else these days, he notes: \u201cIt\u2019s not a wall, it\u2019s a peace border or a green line. They have new names to sell the separation to the population, to try to minimise their effect. But when some border artists come and say, here we are, boom boom boom, the government have to explain why there is suddenly 200 metres of art in the middle of the city.\u201d\n\nThe two artists have collaborated previously. Paris Agar, an art curator in IWM\u2019s cold war team, said bringing them together on the project would \u201cmarry the beginnings of street art\u2019s association with the Berlin Wall with contemporary street art as it responds to issues in today\u2019s society\u201d.\n\nThe two decorated slabs will stand at the museum\u2019s entrance, close to another original section of wall that is in its permanent collection, she said.\n\nYounger people with no memory of the cold war might think \u201cnot again, same old same old\u201d, said Noir, \u201cBut take care. It might come back, and this time be really serious.\n\n\u201cThat is why I think that those pieces of the Berlin Wall [that survive] are a symbol of the new freedom in Europe, but [we must] tell the young generation that that freedom was not falling from the sky. It was a big fight to get that freedom. And do not forget that.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The sections of wall will be on display at IWM London between 5 November and 1 December 2019", "description": "Thierry Noir says his work is a warning not to be complacent about hard-won freedoms", "authors": ["Esther Addley", "John Harris", "Rafael Behr"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ceed6601070a83d6bd22ce38cef16cc513986bb/2489_723_2496_1498/master/2496.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8bfcac48d2558a4d60f58dec3cd03b00", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
