Only 36 percent believe it would be better to reach a short-term agreement that buys time for negotiators to reach a so-called \u201cgrand bargain\u201d to slash the deficit.\n\nStrong majorities, however, oppose proposals that have been part of early talks \u2014 particularly Obama\u2019s request for unilateral authority to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nAccording to the poll, 59 percent reject the president\u2019s demand that Congress give up power to set the country\u2019s borrowing limit. Thirty-nine percent said the president should be the sole decision maker.\n\nThere is similar resistance to potential entitlement reforms that would see the age of eligibility for Medicare benefits rise from age 65 to 67, with 53 percent of likely voters saying they either somewhat or strongly oppose the idea.\n\nThe poll found 50 percent of voters believe Obama and Democrats are being \u201cmore reasonable\u201d than Speaker John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerIs Congress retrievable? Boehner reveals portrait done by George W. Bush Meadows to be replaced by Biggs as Freedom Caucus leader MORE (R-Ohio) and the GOP in the ongoing talks. Thirty-eight percent of people said Boehner John Andrew BoehnerIs Congress retrievable? Boehner reveals portrait done by George W. Bush Meadows to be replaced by Biggs as Freedom Caucus leader MORE and the GOP were being more reasonable.\n\nThat finding furthers the perception Obama holds the upper hand in negotiations and that Republicans have more to lose if talks fail.\n\nA Pew poll released last week, but conducted before Boehner made his latest offer in the talks, found 53 percent of people would blame Republicans if there is no deficit deal, while 27 percent would blame Obama.\n\nBoehner last week asked that he and Obama be allowed to negotiate on their own without Senate leaders and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.).\n\nObama seeks a deal that includes $1.6 trillion in new tax revenue over 10 years and would allow rates to increase for families earning more than $250,000 a year.\n\nBoehner has countered with an offer that includes $800 billion in new revenue through tax reform.\n\nHis proposal reportedly includes $600 billion in healthcare savings that could come, in part, from increasing the age of eligibility for Medicare coverage to 67.\n\nOn Friday, Boehner accused Obama of trying to \u201cslow walk\u201d the negotiations and said, \u201cnothing is going to be possible\u201d if the president continues to insist on tax rate increases for the wealthy.\n\nTreasury Secretary Tim Geithner said last week the White House was \u201cabsolutely\u201d prepared to go over the fiscal cliff if Republicans don\u2019t go along on tax increases for the wealthy.\n\nThe Hill Poll, however, suggests that attitude carries significant political risk for the president.\n\nJust 10 percent of voters said it would be OK if no deal is reached.\n\nThe survey found far greater pessimism among Republicans about the prospects of a deficit deal, with 75 percent saying they had little or no confidence an agreement would be reached.\n\nBy contrast, 59 percent of Democrats expressed the belief a deal would be struck compared to 35 percent who had strong doubts about the chances for success.\n\nRepublicans are also adamantly opposed to giving Obama veto power over the debt-ceiling level with 81 percent against the demand set out by the president in his initial offer to Republicans.\n\nSixty-two percent of Democrats back the president\u2019s request.\n\nThe country came to the brink of a debt default in the summer of 2011 \u2014 setting the stage for the current showdown \u2014 and is likely to reach its existing $16.4 trillion borrowing limit in February.\n\nThe partisan differences are less pronounced on Medicare\u2019s future. Fifty-seven percent of Democrats and 52 percent of Republicans strongly or somewhat oppose a deficit deal that raises the age of eligibility to 67.\n\nA majority of Republicans (51 percent) and Democrats (55 percent) say they\u2019d prefer to see a long-term deficit deal struck now, rather than see Obama and Republicans agree to a temporary fix.\n\nClick here to view data from The Hill Poll.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Six in 10 voters believe debt talks between Obama, Boehner will fail, according to a new poll for The Hill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "published_at": "2012-12-10"}
