It said that participants stated their exceptions that all sides will observe a cease-fire for the duration of intra-Afghan negotiations, calling on the Afghan government and the Taliban to release \"significant numbers of prisoners at the start of intra-Afghan negotiations.\"\n\nMuhemmed Aejaz, head of the Pakistani delegation, tweeted after the meeting that participants \"are hopeful about and agreed to expedite the earliest peaceful resolution of the issue through an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process.\"\n\nRussia initiated the dialogue process this year and also has hosted intra-Afghan meetings in recent months to help end the war because it believes continued instability is encouraging terrorist groups like Islamic State to establish strongholds on Afghan soil to threaten Central Asian allies. The delegates from the four countries held their last meeting in Beijing in July when the U.S.-Taliban talks had reached an advanced stage, and the two adversaries in the 18-year-old Afghan war believed they had come close to concluding a peace deal.\n\nTaliban officials say the understanding would have set the stage for U.S. and other foreign troops to withdraw from the country in return for assurances the insurgent group would prevent Afghan soil from again becoming a terror sanctuary and engage in intra-Afghan peace negotiations to permanently end the hostilities.", "description": "Russia Hosts 4-Nation Afghan Peace Talks, China to Set up Intra-Afghan Conference", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/26/2019102600356_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
