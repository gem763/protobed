Alleged human rights violations in the two states under the governing Bharatiya Janata party have made front pages around the world.\n\nThe award will be the latest addition to Modi\u2019s growing haul of prestigious international prizes.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh (@DrJitendraSingh) Another award,another moment of pride for every Indian, as PM Modi's diligent and innovative initiatives bring laurels from across the world.\n\nSh @narendramodi to receive award from Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for #SwachhBharatAbhiyaan during his visit to the United States. pic.twitter.com/QlsxOWS6jT\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of south Asian Americans working in philanthropy wrote an open letter to the Gates Foundation alleging that Modi had effectively confined millions to their communities, and urging the organisation to rescind the award.\n\n\u201cFor over a month now, PM Modi has placed 8 million people in Jammu and Kashmir under house arrest, blocked communications and media coverage to the outside world, detained thousands of people including children, and denied basic benefits. Reports of torture, including beatings and the murder of a young child by Indian security officers, are emerging as well,\u201d said the letter.\n\n\u201cThe award will signal the international community\u2019s willingness to overlook, and remain silent, in the face of the Indian government\u2019s brazen violations of human rights principles.\u201d\n\nSuchitra Vijayan, a lawyer and co-founder of the research and journalism portal Polis Project, said philanthropic organisations had played a crucial role in \u201cwhitewashing and normalising\u201d Modi\u2019s violations of human rights and democracy.\n\nUntil his election to India\u2019s highest office in 2014, Modi had been unable to enter the US because of his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, in which thousands of Muslims were slaughtered during his tenure as chief minister.\n\n\u201cThe narrative is India being the world\u2019s largest democracy, India being a great place to invest, India shining,\u201d Vijayan said. \u201cAll that only counts if the international community recognises these narratives.\u201d\n\nKenneth Roth (@KenRoth) Why is the @GatesFoundation choosing this moment to honor Indian PM Modi (for fighting open defecation), as Muslims in India face a clampdown in Kashmir, loss of citizenship in Assam, and unremedied violence across the country. https://t.co/Dvgnm5ab14\n\nSince Modi came to power, he has received accolades from governments and organisations around the world.\n\nThe Philip Kotler presidential award honoured Modi for \u201cgiving new life to democracy and economic growth\u201d, while the Seoul peace prize credited him for reducing the social and economic disparity between the rich and the poor. The latter award was made despite worldwide criticism of Modi\u2019s economic policies, including demonetisation, by economic experts.\n\nLast year, the UN gave Modi the Champions of the Earth award, in spite of objections that his government has not only green lit projects that threaten to cause huge deforestation, but also allowed India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, to become one of the most polluted cities on Earth.\n\nThe Swachh Bharat programme, for which Modi is receiving his latest award, has come under huge scrutiny in India.\n\nModi\u2019s government has said that the scheme has provided 90% of Indians with access to clean toilets. However, press reports and a book called Where India Goes, which closely studied the programme, suggest that many of the newly-built toilets remain unused because of poor access to water and caste rules that restrict many people from cleaning them.\n\nIndia\u2019s government has employed controversial tactics to encourage use of the toilets, including \u201cgood morning squads\u201d that involve government officials publicly humiliating those defecating openly. One news channel ran a national \u201cname and shame\u201d campaign urging citizens to \u201cblow the whistle\u201d on those defecating openly.\n\nThe Gates Foundation said in a statement that Modi was being recognised for \u201cthe progress India is making in improving sanitation, as part of its drive toward achievement of the UN sustainable development goals\u201d.\n\n\u201cGlobally, sanitation-related diseases kill nearly 500,000 children under the age of five every year,\u201d said the statement.\n\n\u201cYet despite its importance, sanitation has not received significant attention. A lot of governments are not willing to talk about it, in part because there are not easy solutions.\n\n\u201cBefore the Swachh Bharat mission, over 500 million people in India did not have access to safe sanitation, and now, the majority do. There is still a long way to go, but the impacts of access to sanitation in India are already being realised. The Swachh Bharat mission can serve as a model for other countries around the world that urgently need to improve access to sanitation for the world\u2019s poorest.\u201d", "description": "Alleged human rights violations cast a pall over recognition of Indian prime minister\u2019s flagship sanitation and hygiene initiative", "authors": ["Vidhi Doshi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c106f38ef476c47140dffe1a1003a18c18861616/0_10_2824_1695/master/2824.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=26f7b2d35d58cee034fffbddd2cb7063", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
