By fighting tooth and nail over anything that might weaken the control of the unions and some cowed employer bodies, the industry funds undermine their claim to represent the interests of their customers, rather than the interests of labour movement bosses.\n\nThis ensures that superannuation and long-term retirement incomes policy will remain unnecessarily politicised and unstable. And it means that central questions, such as whether to lift the super guarantee from 9.5 per cent to 12 per cent, must be viewed in part from the perspective that they will further bolster the growing dominance of the industry funds and their labour movement backers in Australia\u2019s capital markets.\n\nRetail funds were disgraced at the financial services royal commission. And the industry funds have exploited their guaranteed income flows to post mostly superior returns. Yet the industry funds have been slow to push for changes that would benefit their members but disrupt the cosy club. Half of the poorly performing funds identified by the Productivity Commission\u2019s report on the competitiveness of the super system were industry funds. The fees eaten up by zombie super accounts dwarf the fee-for-no-service banking scandals revealed by the Hayne royal commission. But the default system embedded into the industrial relations system is a captive market designed to benefit the industry funds and their backers. It is run by labour movement figures such as Greg Combet, the former ACTU secretary who as chairman of Industry Super Australia on Monday criticised Deborah Ralston, one of three members of the panel that will review the retirement income system.\n\nThis new review \u2013 which will seek facts rather than make recommendations \u2013 stems from last year\u2019s Productivity Commission call for a proper retirement incomes study before the compulsory super guarantee is lifted from 9.5 per cent of wages to 12 per cent. The terms of reference include how super, the age pension and private savings work together; the fairness of the system; and how super affects the federal budget through tax concessions and savings on pension outlays. It should provide a factual benchmark to help answer a multitude of questions that should not be coloured by political advantage or vested interest. Ultra-low returns mean Australians may need to save more, backing the 12 per cent call. But slower wage growth may increase the hit to current living standards for low-paid and younger workers. Options such as including the family home in pensions assets test shouldn\u2019t be ruled out. And trends such as falling home ownership rates need to be factored in. Many such things are related: the pensioner retiree living in a multi-million-dollar home is the flip side of high big-city house prices.\n\nLabor has few grounds to challenge the appointment of the eminently qualified Professor Ralston to the review panel just because she may not sing from the industry fund song sheet. The party has its own history of rejecting recommendations from reviews it appointed that undermined the industry fund power base, such as the 2009 Cooper review\u2019s call for one-third of super fund board members to be independent. Professor Ralston is no less independent than, say, Don Russell, a former Keating adviser, the \u2018\u2018independent\u2019\u2019 AustralianSuper board member who is now being elevated to chair Australia\u2019s biggest industry super fund.\n\nSuper will be a $6 trillion industry in a decade, far larger than the $4 trillion Australian Securities Exchange. Yet it stands on a membership base of apathy, inertia and default. It needs proper scrutiny, and a rent-seeking industry super club should not be able to avoid it. A government-run default fund, such as in Canada, could exploit economies of scale to drive down costs to negligible levels. Industry funds, retail funds and others could then compete over the sort of services that the system is yet to provide for: such as how individual Australians make their nest eggs deliver the sort of lifestyle they worked decades for.\n\nSuper stands on a membership base of apathy, inertia and default.", "description": "It is getting harder to create a competitive and efficient retirement system when it is encumbered by the vested interests of industry super", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_81/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7f87894883f04a34f18fc1a1186af1836303d1d6", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
