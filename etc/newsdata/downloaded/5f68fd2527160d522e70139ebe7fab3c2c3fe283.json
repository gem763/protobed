But his true passion was art, and so Michael Stewart was studying at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. In the early morning hours of Sept. 15, 1983, Stewart was returning to that borough, where he had been born and raised, after spending the evening with friends in Manhattan.\n\nHe never made it. On the platform of the Brooklyn-bound L train at the First Avenue station, at about 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, transit officers of the New York Police Department supposedly caught him spray-painting graffiti on a wall. Cops say that Stewart was initially compliant but then tried to break free. A friend who had been with him believes they were furious because they\u2019d seen Stewart, a black man, kiss her, a white woman. The officers dragged Stewart up the station stairs and, according to witnesses, threw him down and beat him.\n\nThey allegedly continued to assail Stewart in the police van that took him to a Union Square police station, where a New York University student says she heard him scream: \u201cHelp me.\u201d Nobody did. The officers did finally transport Stewart to Bellevue, the public hospital on Manhattan\u2019s East Side. It was too late. Thirty-two minutes after he\u2019d been apprehended underground by the police, Stewart was in a coma. He died two weeks later.\n\nMany New Yorkers today are learning about Stewart\u2019s fate for the first time \u2014 36 years after his death \u2014 because his story is on vivid display in a current exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum, \u201cBasquiat\u2019s \u2018Defacement\u2019: The Untold Story.\u201d \u201cDefacement,\u201d also known as \u201cThe Death of Michael Stewart,\u201d is a Black Lives Matter painting created three decades before the movement against police brutality took hold. That painting is the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, who was born to a Puerto Rican mother and Haitian-American father and raised in relatively prosperous circumstances in brownstone Brooklyn. He dealt frequently with issues of race in his work but never as arrestingly as in his portrayal of two pink-faced cops beating a black figure into a shapeless pulp.\n\nFrom left to right, Yusef Salaam, Korey Wise, Ava DuVernay, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson and Antron McCay attend a June event for \"When They See Us\" in Los Angeles.

This spring, director Ava Duvernay\u2019s miniseries \u201cWhen They See Us\u201d offered a reassessment of the five young black men wrongly convicted of raping a jogger in Central Park in 1989. At the time, Donald Trump called for those young men, known as the Central Park Five, to be put to death. He has recently defended doing so, arguing that \u201cyou have people on both sides of that.\u201d Those words were an echo, at least to critics, of Trump\u2019s claim that there were \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d of a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., that descended into violence and left three dead. And more recently, Trump has opened a feud with the Rev. Al Sharpton, whom he has known \u2014 in part as a friend \u2014 for decades.\n\nThat led the MSNBC anchor Joy Reid to write on Twitter that \u201cTrump has turned the whole country into 1980s New York,\u201d reanimating the racial and cultural grievances of that time.\n\nTrump built his eponymous tower on Fifth Avenue in 1979. Three years later, he appeared on the first Forbes list of wealthy Americans, though he vastly exaggerated his net worth in order to do so. It was also in that same year, 1982, that Basquiat, who had gotten his start as a graffiti artist known as Samo, entered a fecund period that would last for six years. During this time, he painted the works that would make him \u201cAmerica\u2019s first truly important black painter,\u201d as Vanity Fair would later write.", "description": "In the early morning hours of Sept. 15, 1983, Michael Stewart was returning to Brooklyn, where he had been born and raised, after spending the evening with friends in Manhattan.
