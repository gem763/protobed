Leaders in the Democratic-controlled State Senate have organized a panel to review PG&E\u2019s actions.\n\nMr. Vesey said he had spoken to customers whose power had been shut off at a community resource center set up by the utility and acknowledged their discontent.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right \u2014 what we do is not popular,\u201d Mr. Vesey said during a news conference on Sunday night. \u201cI will not tell you that people congratulated us. People are angry.\u201d", "description": "An evacuation order still stands for 180,000 residents of Sonoma County, while part of Napa County is under an evacuation warning.", "authors": ["Neil Vigdor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/us/28fires-001/28fires-001-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
