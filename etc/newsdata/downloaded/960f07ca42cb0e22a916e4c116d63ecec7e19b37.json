This also includes working with Red Hat's partners that are traditionally known as competitors to Big Blue.\n\n\"Our CEO is very open and transparent and he has those conversations with us every month and talks about what he's been doing and what he thinks we all need to do, and it's almost a self-governing organisation,\" he said. \"We just continue to drive it that way.\"\n\nMcLaren was expanding on remarks he made during his keynote.\n\n\"It has indeed been a momentous year for us at Red Hat and we are humbled by the recognition that IBM has made by investing in our culture, our people, and our technology to build a brighter future for our organisations,\" he said.\n\n\"Having worked for both of those organisations for the majority of my 35 years in this industry, I couldn't be more excited by the opportunity.\"\n\nAccording to McLaren, Red Hat's customers are often drawn to the company for its culture, and want to learn how to adopt it within their own organisations.\n\nCFO out in alleged workplace standards violation\n\nRed Hat chief financial officer Eric Shander was shown the door last week for allegedly violating workplace standards, Raleigh News & Observer reported.\n\nAccording to the report, Shander was dismissed without pay. It says the now former CFO had received $3.8 million in total compensation during fiscal year 2019, and that he would have been in line for a cash retention award of $4 million if he stayed with the company for 12 months following the IBM merger close.\n\nWith his departure, Shander misses out on the retention bonus, as the closure of the IBM merger was only finalised in July.\n\nShander started his tenure as Red Hat's EVP and CFO in December 2016, following a little over a year as the company's chief accounting officer.\n\nPrior to Red Hat, Shander was with IBM, most recently in the capacity of VP of global technology services delivery.\n\nLaurie Krebs, previously Red Hat's senior vice president of finance, has stepped in to fill Shander's role.\n\nWith Red Hat not making an official comment on Shander's departure, the Wall Street Journal said it was also told the CFO was \"dismissed without pay in connection with Red Hat's workplace standards\".\n\nAsha Barbaschow travelled to Red Hat Forum as a guest of Red Hat.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Customers come to Redhat because of its culture, ANZ MD Max McLaren has said.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/15/c2b4101c-186a-4784-945f-adbd2a42ca39/thumbnail/770x578/eb9bcb5e1104645ca79c94cff7886ab1/image-from-ios-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
