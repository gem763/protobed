Her work is often compared to that of of Judy Chicago, Hilma af Klint, and especially Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, and its kinship with these blue-chip feminist abstractionists might have something to do with why she has become one of the most successful young artists in New York right now. But its also frank and funny about sex and of course travels well on Instagram. Many of her paintings reference her sex life with her husband, sculptor Brian Caverly: \u201cI have made a bazillion paintings that are just of his penis, all of these lingams,\u201d Hollowell tells me. \u201cI make them over and over again in a million colors.\u201d Vaginas are symbolized by a glowing almond shape, and orgasms are squiggly lines and shapes that radiate with light.\n\nHer latest show, \u201cPlumb Line,\u201d which helps inaugurate Pace Gallery\u2019s big new West Chelsea HQ \u2014 which feels much more like a museum than a gallery \u2014 opens on September 14. This time, Hollowell shifts away from depictions of her sex life and focuses on one of its results. \u201cThere\u2019s no penises, it\u2019s all me,\u201d she says of the paintings. The nine works represent Hollowell\u2019s body during pregnancy, while giving birth, and postpartum. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of them as portraits of myself,\u201d she says. Only two of the works that will be in the Pace show are still in Hollowell\u2019s studio when I visit, and each is in bright and rich colors that call to mind the cover of a 1970s sci-fi novel. Her work is easy to imagine living with, which might be why so many collectors have been lining up to buy her paintings. Glowing orbs and concentric circles fill the canvases, punctuated with 3-D high-density foam pieces. The works abstract the artist\u2019s body into something resembling the solar system. \u201cI felt like my body was just so singular and present and kind of alone doing its thing during the pregnancy and the birth that I had to make a monument to it, or something,\u201d Hollowell says.\n\nThe planets have aligned for Hollowell: In 2015, a New York Times review of her solo show at the now-closed 106 Green gallery in Greenpoint predicted as much: \u201cThe next time you see Loie Hollowell\u2019s paintings it will probably not be in a small, artist-run gallery in someone\u2019s apartment that is open only on Sundays or by appointment \u2026 Ms. Hollowell is a gifted painter, and her work could easily reach larger audiences soon,\u201d wrote Martha Schwendener. Pace Gallery announced that it would represent Hollowell in January 2017, and has since put on solo shows of her work in their Palo Alto and London locations. The Palo Alto show sold out, as did Pace\u2019s offerings of Hollowell\u2019s abstract pastels at Frieze, which Bloomberg reported, in an article naming Hollowell as part of a \u201chot-artist wave,\u201d sold out in under 40 minutes. So it makes sense Pace is having her works amongst the offerings at their multi-gallery new art galleria. Hollowell knows this: \u201cIt feels like the big one,\u201d she tells me on the Friday morning that I visit her studio. There\u2019s an undeniable anticipatory vibe in the air that day. The doorbell rings four times in the hour I\u2019m there, and each time Hollowell apologizes profusely and springs up to answer. We run back and forth to her computer several times to look at reference points for her work \u2014 Renaissance cartoons, Italian futurist Giacomo Balla\u2019s \u201cDynamism of a Dog on a Leash,\u201d Neotantric Indian painter Gulam Rasool Santoosh \u2014 and to a wall where several pastel sketches of the pieces included in the Pace show hang. The pastels are a part of Hollowell\u2019s process, and include notes in the margins to guide her as she works (\u201cRadiating from my core;\u201d \u201cNipples are as bright as semicircles;\u201d and \u201cPregnant and having to pee all the time,\u201d are a few that I notice).\n\nThe pastel sketches include the five elements \u2014 \u201chead, boob, belly, butt, mandorla,\u201d Hollowell ticks them off \u2014 that are then used in her final works. The \u201cmandorla,\u201d Italian for \u201calmond,\u201d has become a regular feature in Hollowell\u2019s paintings. \u201cIt\u2019s some religious, Catholic symbol and you see it in a lot of Gothic cathedrals and shit, but it\u2019s such a cool shape for a vagina,\u201d she says. I ask if there is spiritualism in her work \u2014 similar to that of Hilma af Klint, who used symbols to commune with spirits. \u201cI\u2019m into thinking about the practice of making art as a spiritual practice,\u201d Hollowell tells me. \u201cI guess if life itself is a spiritual endeavor, or sex itself is a spiritual practice of meeting God in an act of living, or meeting God in an act of having sex, then I guess what I\u2019m doing is spiritual because I am synthesizing those experiences through my hands and into the work.\u201d\n\nHollowell was conceived at the Roswell Artist-in-Residence Program \u2014 the same Roswell of UFO fame. She says her parents, artists David and Terry Hollowell, \u201clike to talk about that.\u201d Hollowell\u2019s father, a now-retired professor of painting and drawing at UC Davis, showed his figurative paintings in New York galleries in the late \u201980s and \u201990s, but his career there was short-lived. \u201cMy dad is definitely very cautious of the New York art world because I think he feels like he was kind of spurred by it,\u201d Hollowell says. \u201cHis work was selling because it was a time period when the work fit what was going on at the moment. But then he changed his work and the gallery wanted to stop working with him and didn\u2019t let him change.\u201d\n\nI ask Hollowell if the fickleness of collecting trends concerns her, as well. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d she says. \u201cI think art goes in cycles. Right now there\u2019s a real push to support women and women making descriptive imagery and illustrative imagery and personal imagery in painting, and these cycles go \u2014 what five years, ten years, I mean not even, like two years, three years \u2014 so I\u2019ve accepted that \u2026 Keeping costs low is really important,\u201d Hollowell says. \u201cJust in case.\u201d She would like her new body of work to be \u201cmore universal\u201d to viewers, too. Hollowell cites comedians Amy Schumer, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and Ali Wong as some of her \u201cmain inspirations.\u201d \u201cThese women are just doing exactly what I want to do with painting. They\u2019re just being so honest, but universal,\u201d Hollowell says. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re super honest, but not being aggressive about it \u2014 they\u2019re not excluding men. They\u2019re being like, Isn\u2019t this hilarious, listen to my story.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlumb Line\u201d opens September 14 at Pace Gallery, 540 W. 25th St., 2nd fl.", "description": "Loie Hollowell\u2019s latest show, \u201cPlumb Line,\u201d at Pace Gallery in West Chelsea, feels much more like a museum than a gallery \u2014 opens on September 14.
