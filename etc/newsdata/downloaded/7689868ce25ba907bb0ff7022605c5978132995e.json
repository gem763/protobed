And being both at once can be incredibly challenging. But professors like Ramata Sissoko Ciss\u00e9 make it a whole lot easier.\n\nCiss\u00e9, 51, valiantly stepped in recently, carrying an infant on her back during a three-hour biology class after the baby\u2019s mom, Ciss\u00e9\u2019s student, couldn\u2019t find a sitter. Now a photo of the good deed has gone viral.\n\nCiss\u00e9, an assistant professor of biology for anatomy and physiology at Georgia Gwinnett College in Lawrenceville, Ga., is a mother as well. And the night before one of her 8am classes, a student reached out with a question.\n\n\u201dShe asked if she could bring the baby with her to class because she had missed a class already and did not want to be behind,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 tells Yahoo Lifestyle, adding that the student had an upcoming exam. \u201cI know the student is very smart and ambitious. She really wanted to learn.\u201d\n\nCiss\u00e9 told her to bring the baby to class so they could \u201cfigure it out\u201d together.\n\nThe student did bring her infant, but was struggling to write with her baby in her lap. That\u2019s when the professor says her \u201cmother\u2019s instincts\u201d kicked in. \u201cI knew I could make it easy for her not only to concentrate but also to take notes with ease,\u201d she says. That\u2019s when she had an idea.\n\n\u201cIn my native Mali, we used sheets and other pieces of fabric to securely carry babies on our backs,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 says. \u201cMy natural instinct was to find a way to secure the baby and I was standing next to a rack with a clean lab coat.\u201d\n\nWith the help of her student, Ciss\u00e9 secured the infant to her back, where the baby slept for most of the class.\n\n\u201cTowards the end, he woke up and I took him off my back, sat in the first row and fed him with a bottle. He did not cry once,\u201d she adds.\n\nLater that day, Ciss\u00e9\u2019s daughter, Anna, posted a photo that the student took of her with the baby strapped to her back on Twitter, calling her mother her \u201crole model.\u201d\n\nmy mom is my role model.\n\n\n\nher student couldn\u2019t find a babysitter today & being the true African mother that she is, taught a THREE hour class with the baby on her back & fed him.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m so blessed to be raised by a woman who loves the world as much as her own children. pic.twitter.com/6yuynJhuPw \u2014 Annadote \ud83d\udc8a (@AnnaKhadejah) September 20, 2019\n\n\u201cBeing the true African mother that she is, taught a THREE hour class with the baby on her back & fed him,\u201d reads a tweet from Ciss\u00e9\u2019s daughter Anna on Sept. 19. \u201cI\u2019m so blessed to be raised by a woman who loves the world as much as her own children.\u201d\n\nThe heartwarming photo quickly went viral online, garnering over 56,000 likes on Twitter \u2014 similar to past viral snaps of baby-holding professors in South Carolina, Nevada and Jerusalem, Israel in previous years.\n\nI recognize that style of hat anywhere! Dr. Cisse is BY FAR one of the best professors I\u2019ve ever had. \u2014 Gabe (@Cubanbabe97) September 20, 2019\n\nWhile this professor\u2019s current and former students commented on the photo, calling her the \u201cGOAT\u201d and \u201cone of the best professors\u201d they\u2019ve ever had, strangers online were cheering her on from afar.\n\n\u201cShe is amazing honestly. We all need teachers like her in life,\u201d one Twitter user wrote. Another user suggested that Georgia Gwinnett College give the professor a raise and tenure at the university.\n\nGive sis a raise and tenure!!!! pic.twitter.com/viZn1NVrm9 \u2014 The Dark Lord \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d! \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf2 \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf9 (@Tea_witdre) September 21, 2019\n\nAlthough people online are hailing Cisse\u00e9 as a \u201csaint,\u201d she simply chalks it up to being a good teacher \u2014 and a good mother.\n\n\u201cMy decision to help out this student was driven by the school culture with a student\u2019s success being foremost. We do all we can for the student to be successful,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cI did not want to see her struggling, because as a mother, I know how hard it could be.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\u2022 Teacher gives birth outside school with principal and dean's help: 'They were my support people'\n\n\u2022 Substitute teacher wins $1 million in lottery scratch-off on her birthday: 'Someone pinch me'\n\n\u2022 Teacher carries student who uses a wheelchair so she can enjoy field trip: 'Never feel like you're left alone'\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Ciss\u00e9 told her to bring the baby to class so they could \u201cfigure it out\u201d together.", "authors": ["Paulina Cachero"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Qdl.scm1mvKSRh57f6Zeyw--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9Njc1O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/da534fd0-dfd2-11e9-a7f2-6c97e00f2140", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
