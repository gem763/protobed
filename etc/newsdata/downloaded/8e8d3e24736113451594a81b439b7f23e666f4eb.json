Although a draft agreement presented by Zalmay Khalilzad, the head of the US team, had faced criticism, this is seen as a possibility for the near future.\n\nAbdullah Abdullah, the co-leader of the outgoing government, and the main challenger to president Ashraf Ghani in the election, had said that \u201cinterim power-sharing\u201d with the Taliban could be the answer to ending the endless strife.\n\nCasting his vote at the polling station of Amani High School in Kabul, Mr Ghani praised the security forces for \u201cputting in place strong measures to prevent attacks and protect the nation\u201d.\n\nAccompanied by his wife Bibi Gul and running mate Amrullah Saleh, he insisted that a settlement to the conflict remained the priority. \u201cOur plans are ready for implementation, we are waiting for a fresh mandate from the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But women queued up in traditionally conservative Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban, before polling stations opened at 7am, despite recent violence.\n\nSome voters and officiators turned up against the wishes of family members and friends who are worried about security. They said they felt it was their duty as citizens to do so.\n\nAnd some had deeply personal reasons to vote.\n\n\u201cI know my relations would be unhappy about me being here, they have asked me not to\u201d, said Sherenshah Paikai, an election observer for Mr Ghani\u2019s campaign at a polling station at Zarghuna High School.\n\n\u201cMy husband was killed in a suicide bombing, leaving my children fatherless. I know what it\u2019s like to be affected by violence. Our country cannot go on like this, more dead, more widows. People need to vote so that we have a stable government.\u201d\n\nPeace and stability is not her only concern. Ms Paikai has had to bring up four children by herself since her husband Abdulbakir, a shopkeeper, was killed four years ago.\n\n\u201cI had a job with the UN, but then the contract finished, and now I am without work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a struggle, our economy needs to improve.\u201d\n\nMs Paikai said that despite the killing of her husband, she would welcome the Taliban getting involved in politics and becoming part of a future government if that bought peace.\n\n\u201cThey must realise that just keeping on killing is not the answer. We would like them to come back into society \u2013 as long as they give up violence,\u201d she said.\n\nWatching out for any malpractice alongside Ms Paikai at the polling station was Khatima Karimi, a 21-year-old nursing student who was an observer for the Abdullah team.\n\n\u201cI am interested in politics as a woman and an Afghan and so I wanted to join in,\u201d she said. \u201cI did this role in the parliamentary election last year and I know what to do, I want to get involved in this more.\u201d\n\nMs Karimi said she wanted to continue to live and work at a hospital in Afghanistan after she qualified. \u201cI want to help sick people \u2013 that is why I am doing my nursing course. I know I will have to treat people injured in the fighting, but we all hope there is an end to that soon,\u201d she said.\n\nThe previous four Afghan elections, since the fall of the Taliban, were mired in allegations of fraud \u2013 and there have been accusations that the result will be \u201cfixed\u201d this time too.\n\nDr Abdullah, who holds that he was the victim of fraud in the 2014 election against Dr Ghani, and in the previous poll against former president Hamid Karzai, maintained: \u201cWe have registered quite a few complaints, but this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\u201cMy main concern will be that massively fraudulent elections will have an impact on the mentality of the people on whether the democratic process has been functioning or not. If there is massive fraud, and somebody is announced as a winner, this will not be accepted.\u201d\n\nThe Independent Election Commission, administering the polls, claims that the use of biometric verification will prevent ballot-rigging. Every polling station has been supplied with equipment to match fingerprints and photographs to identity cards.\n\nHawa Alam Nuristani, the chair of the election commission, stressed that only votes with biometric verification would be counted.\n\nBut there have been complaints of the machines breaking down and officials not being able to use them properly.\n\nChecking the voters biometrically at Amani, Zahra Abdulrahimzai did not think the system would pose too many problems.\n\nThe 20-year-old medical student said: \u201cWe have had five days of training and this is not difficult, we haven\u2019t had any issues this morning. The people seem to accept it.\u201d\n\nCasting his vote at Zarghuna High School, acting interior minister Massoud Andarabi pointed out that major violence had, so far, been averted.\n\n\u201cWe had been working 24/7 to minimise the danger and this has paid off,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very glad that we created the conditions for voting to take place.\u201d\n\nBut the numbers turning up remained low. Naim Jalauddin, leaving the polling station, said: \u201cWhen I came for the parliamentary election last year, I had to wait 40 minutes. This time it took two minutes.\n\n\u201cThere are two reasons why so few are here. People are scared of getting bombed, and also many are just disillusioned with politicians and turning away from politics. Neither is good for the country.\u201d\n\nRead the first part of the Conflict Without End series here: Afghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption; the second part here: Afghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: \u2018My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up\u2019; the third part here: Raid on al-Qaeda bomb factory leaves dozens of wedding-goers dead, in latest Afghan violence\u200b; the fourth part here: On the Afghan campaign trail in the shadow of the destroyed Buddhas of Bamiyan, talk of Taliban return divides\u200b; and the fifth part here: As Afghanistan heads to polls, Middle East rivalries threaten already fraught political scene", "description": "Bombings and shootings,\u00a0Taliban\u00a0threats of massacre and accusations of fraud plagued\u00a0Afghanistan\u2019s presidential election on Saturday.
