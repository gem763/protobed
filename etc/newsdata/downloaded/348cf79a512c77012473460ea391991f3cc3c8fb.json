Scorsese potentially directing \"Joker\" is surprising given his comments about Marvel superhero movies in Empire Magazine last week.\n\n\"I don't see them,\" Scorsese told Empire Magazine last week regarding Marvel movies. \"I tried, you know? But that's not cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\"\n\nBut \"Joker\" isn't a typical comic-book movie. The R-rated origin story for Batman's famous foe has drawn criticism for its graphic depictions of violence, which gained national attention after some family members of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado mass-shooting victims sent a letter to Warner Bros. with concerns.\n\nStill, the movie earned $96 million domestically over the weekend, a record debut for October, and has made $258 million worldwide off of a $55 million budget.", "description": "Martin Scorsese originally eyed \"Joker\" as a \"potential directing vehicle,\" according to a new Hollywood Reporter report.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e0b78122bd54bd924e478?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
