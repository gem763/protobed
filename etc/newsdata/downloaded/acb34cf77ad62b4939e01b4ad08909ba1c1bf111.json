Saved well later to prevent Son making it two. 6\n\nAinsley Maitland-Niles Steady performance from a player who looks increasingly mature defensively. Early shot blocked. 7\n\nSokratis Papastathopoulos AAll at sea before Eriksen\u2019s goal. Thought he had won it but Kolasinac was ruled offside. 6\n\nDavid Luiz Lack of positional awareness was laid bare early on when Eriksen scored and Son went close. 5\n\nAubameyang completes comeback and earns Arsenal draw against Spurs Read more\n\nSead Kolasinac Inches from scoring early in the second half but was not quite at his rampaging best on the left flank. 6\n\nLucas Torreira Tigerish and dogged, attributes that helped Arsenal get a foothold in the game before he was subbed. 7\n\nGranit Xhaka Only he will know what he was doing with the daft lunge on Son that could have cost the match. 5\n\nMatt\u00e9o Guendouzi Fine ball for Aubameyang\u2019s goal and was denied one of his own by Lloris. Positive showing. 7\n\nNicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 Drilled an early effort over and snatched at one later on. Flashes of promise but clearly not at full tilt yet. 6\n\nAlexandre Lacazette Explosive finish reignited the game, and tireless work all over the pitch. Went off with cramp. 8\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang Had rarely got close to goal before timing his run perfectly to poach Arsenal\u2019s equaliser. Also a wide threat. 7\n\nSubstitutes Dani Ceballos (for Torreira 63) 7, Henrikh Mkhitaryan (for Lacazette 67) 6\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry Kane claimed for a penalty after taking on Sokratis Papastathopoulos late in the match.

Subbed on the hour. 7\n\nMoussa Sissoko Needed to offer more of his physicality and ability to carry the ball. Missed late chance to win it. 6\n\nHarry Winks Smart play in buildup to the penalty award but struggled to get on the ball during the second period. 6\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nChristian Eriksen Early tap-in seemed a perfect way to banish the summer\u2019s issues, but was subdued after a sparky start. 6\n\nHarry Kane Involved in Spurs\u2019 first goal, rammed in the penalty and was so unlucky to rap the post later on. 7\n\nSon Heung-min The best forward on show by a distance before the break but reduced to scraps as the game went on. 8\n\nSubstitutes Dele Alli (for Lamela 60) 6, Giovani Lo Celso (for Son 79) 6", "description": "Son Heung-min was the best forward on show early on in the 2-2 Premier League draw between Arsenal and Tottenham before Alexandre Lacazette reignited the game", "authors": ["Nick Ames"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/991916bbd9e734c839a44e432a5669fcd37ebe51/219_35_2236_1341/master/2236.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f25a117b3ab7a0eb71b529bb50984e9"}
