This issue raises questions about drugs that are made overseas.\n\nWalgreens, Walmart and CVS have removed the supposedly tainted drug from their shelves.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNevertheless, my patients and friends understandably have had many questions, such as:\n\nWhat is Zantac?\n\nBoth it and its generic equivalent, ranitidine, are histamine H2 blockers, which prevent the production of excess stomach acid, thereby being useful to treat reflux, gastritis and ulcers, among other related conditions. There are many alternatives, but millions rely on this drug.\n\nWhat is the cancer-causing agent involved in this case, and should we worry about it?\n\nThe contaminant is a nitrosamine known as NDMA (N-Nitrosodimethylamine), and it has been shown to cause several kinds of cancer in mice, including uterine and bladder cancer.\n\nLast year there was a scare about a common and useful blood pressure drug, Valsartan (much of it produced in China and India) containing NDMA.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA study published in Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that rubber workers exposed to NDMA had an increase in cancers of the throat and esophagus.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, a study over five years with regular use of Valsartan found no increase in cancer.\n\nNevertheless, Valsartan and several related blood-pressure drugs were withdrawn from the market, and the prescribing options for doctors has dwindled.\n\nCan NDMA make you sick?\n\nThis is a bit of an absurd question, since the symptoms of acute toxicity \u2014 including nausea, vomiting, liver and kidney failure \u2014 would require many thousands of times more NDMA than is being discovered in either Valsartan or Zantac. The chances of you getting sick from taking Zantac as a result of NDMA are exactly zero.\n\nAt most, Zantac contains as much NDMA as cured meat products such as ham, hot dogs or bacon. Eating these foods every day are a probable human carcinogen, too.\n\nSo, what should we do now?\n\nIf you took a Zantac yesterday, or you take one tomorrow or the day after, you will be completely fine, at least regarding any concerns involving NDMA. I would follow FDA guidelines, and not continue to take drugs that have been recalled \u2014 although the risks are extremely low of there being any problem whatsoever, even if you took the drug every day over many years.\n\nAt the same time, this is a good moment to examine alternatives, and why or whether you actually need this drug in the first place. Weight loss and dietary changes can reduce your need for stomach medication in many cases.\n\nHow did this happen, and what should be done about it?\n\nThis is a more complicated question, since Zantac and related drugs have now been found to release small amounts of NDMA when broken down in the stomach. The Connecticut on-line pharmacy Valisure found the problem and alerted the FDA, which is in the process of studying it.\n\nBut the main thing that all of these drugs have in common is that they were produced overseas in other countries.\n\nNo matter how many inspectors we send to other countries, we can\u2019t control the manufacturing process the way we can control it in our own labs. Since we pay top dollar for our medications, we need to have more control over what\u2019s in them and how they are made. When we lose this control and we can\u2019t be assured of purity, panic \u2014 and, potentially, serious health consequences \u2014 can result.\n\nMarc Siegel M.D. is a professor of medicine and medical director at Doctor Radio at NYU Langone Health.
