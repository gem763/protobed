Covering national security. And homeland security. And with many of the same skills I used in the U.S. Army as a public affairs officer. Some would argue that\u2019s propaganda.\u201d\n\n\n\nCBP officer: \u201cYou\u2019re a journalist?\u201d\n\n\n\nWatson: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\nCBP officer: \u201cYou write propaganda, right?\u201d\n\n\n\nWatson waited five seconds. Then: \u201cFor the purposes of expediting this conversation, yes.\u201d\n\n\n\nCBP officer, a fourth time: \u201cYou write propaganda, right?\u201d\n\n\n\nWatson, again: \u201cFor the purposes of expediting this conversation, yes.\u201d\n\n\n\nCBP officer: \u201cHere you go.\u201d\n\n\n\nWatson finally was given his passport after wisely \u201cexpediting this conversation.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\nIn a statement provided to The Hill, the award-winning journalist, whose work has included reporting from the front lines in Afghanistan, says he's received \"overwhelming private support\" for reporting on the exchange.\n\n\n\n\"What happened was not normal, irrelevant to the matter of re-entry into the U.S., and seemingly part of a pattern of hectoring journalists in America at the border,\" Watson says in an email. \"Looking back, I'm enormously encouraged by the overwhelming private support I've received for speaking out and for doing what we felt was the right thing in these circumstances.\"\n\nThe Hill has reached out to CBP for comment.\n\nDefense One noted that CBP \u201cis aware of and is investigating the \u2018allegation about an officer\u2019s alleged inappropriate conduct at Washington Dulles International airport,\u2019 adding that the agency holds its employees accountable and does not tolerate inappropriate comments or behavior.\u201d\n\nWatson's decision to speak up on the matter appears to have gone up the food chain and onto the radar of acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan, who is a no-nonsense guy, if his recent interviews on border security and immigration are any indication.\n\nAt a White House press conference, Morgan was asked about harassment of some U.S. journalists at border-control points, including Seth Harp of The Intercept, who was held for several hours without apparent cause by CBP in May at an airport in Austin, Texas.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cLet me say that any journalist \u2014 right? \u2014 that is stopped and harassed and treated improperly because they\u2019re a journalist is absolutely unacceptable, unequivocally,\u201d Morgan said on Tuesday. \u201cWe, proactively, if we see something in an article, even if it hasn\u2019t been reported, we\u2019re going to report it to our Office of Professional Responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little thing in the country called freedom of speech. So, anything that we do that would impede that, we are going to hold people accountable as unacceptable, 100 percent,\" he added.\n\nEvery journalist who experiences this kind of treatment should show the moxie reporters that Watson and Harp did in letting the public know specifically what happened.\n\nThe media is as unpopular as ever right now: A Gallup poll on media in 1976 showed that 72 percent of the country trusted the institution. By 2018, an Axios/Survey Monkey poll showed 72 percent now \u201cthink news sources report news they know to be fake, false or purposely misleading.\u201d That included 92 percent of Republicans, 79 percent of independents and a majority of Democrats (53 percent).\n\nThat doesn't give anyone permission, particularly government workers in agencies like CBP, to use a broad brush and harass those just doing their jobs.\n\nWe will follow developments in the Watson story to see what accountability, if any, is ultimately applied.\n\nJoe Concha is a media reporter for The Hill and co-host of \"WOR Tonight with Joe Concha\" weeknights on 710-WOR in New York.
