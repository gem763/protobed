An officer fired at Tsang Tuesday after the teen struck him with a metal rod \u2013 making Tsang the first known victim of police gunfire since the protests began in June, the Associated Press reports.\n\n\"The Hong Kong police have gone trigger-happy and nuts,\" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said Wednesday.\n\n\"The sensible police response should have been to use a police baton or pepper spray, etc., to fight back,\u201d Mo added, after viewing a video of the incident. \u201cIt wasn't exactly an extreme situation and the use of a live bullet simply cannot be justified.\"\n\nHONG KONG VIOLENCE LEAVES 1 SHOT BY POLICE AS CHINA MARKS 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF COMMUNIST PARTY\n\nTsang is currently hospitalized and his condition was described by the government as stable on Wednesday.\n\nSitting crossed-legged, some of his supporters Wednesday held an arm across their chest below their left shoulder \u2014 the location of the teenager's gunshot wound. One held a hand-written message condemning \"thug police.\"\n\nSchoolmates told the Associated Press that Tsang loves basketball and was passionate about the pro-democracy cause. A student who wore a Guy Fawkes mask and declined to be named because of fear of retribution told the Associated Press that Tsang was \"like a big brother\" to him and other junior students.\n\n\"During the protests, we would feel safe if he is around because he was always the first to charge forward and would protect us when we were in danger,\" the student said.\n\n\"I vividly remember him saying that he would rather die than be arrested. What an awful twist of fate that it was he, of all people, who was shot by the police.\"\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: HONG KONG FREEDOM FIGHTERS NEED AND DESERVE US SUPPORT\n\nHong Kong is a former British colony that's been part of China since 1997 and which Beijing says benefits from autonomy, crediting a \"one country, two systems\" approach.\n\nThe structure allows the city certain democratic rights that are not afforded to people on the mainland \u2014 but, in recent years, some in Hong Kong have accused the Communist Party-ruled central government of slowly stripping their freedoms.\n\nHong Kong police, who have defended the officer's use of force against Tsang as \"reasonable and lawful,\u201d says the teenager has been arrested despite being hospitalized and that authorities will decide later whether to press charges.\n\nPolice Commissioner Stephen Lo said late Tuesday that the officer had feared for his life and made \"a split-second\" decision to fire a single shot at close range.\n\nChinese state media also defended the officer\u2019s actions, with the Xinhua News Agency publishing a commentary early Wednesday calling them \u201ctotally legal, legitimate and appropriate,\u201d according to the South China Morning Post.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018black terror\u2019 that has lasted for more than three months is close to craziness,\u201d it reportedly added. \u201cTo stop the violence and curb disorder, we must make prominent the power of the rule of law, cut the tumor of violence and prosecute all rioters in accordance with the law as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nYet the warning appeared to fall flat Wednesday as dozens of black-clad demonstrators also protested at a luxury mall in Kowloon district. Elsewhere, more than 1,000 office workers skipped their lunch to join an impromptu march in the city's business district against the police shooting.\n\nBritish Foreign Minister Dominic Raab criticized the shooting as \"disproportionate\" and some U.S. lawmakers also joined in the condemnation.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry office in Hong Kong slammed British and American politicians and accused them of condoning violence and crime. It called the rioters the \"greatest threat to Hong Kong and the common enemy of the international community.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nMeanwhile, an Indonesian journalist who was shot in the face with a police projectile on Sunday has been left blinded in one eye, her lawyer told the Hong Kong Free Press.\n\n\u201cDoctors treating Ms [Veby Mega] Indah have today informed her that regrettably the injury she received as a result of being shot by police, will result in permanent blindness in her right eye,\u201d Michael Vidler was quoted as saying. \u201cShe was informed that the pupil of her eye was ruptured by the force of the impact.
