Sure, there are 17 \u201cmajor\u201d candidates already running, but Democratic bigwigs are apparently convinced that that isn\u2019t enough, and want someone \u2014 Hillary Clinton, or Sherrod Brown, or John Kerry, or Michael Bloomberg \u2014 to come to the rescue.\n\nIs this a real possibility?\n\nI can\u2019t read the minds of any of those bold-faced names, all of whom have reportedly been urged by Democratic donors to enter the race. But I think these donors are out to lunch \u2014 and out of touch: I don\u2019t buy that Democratic voters really want another candidate. And even if the voters did, I don\u2019t think the new candidate would find it so easy to succeed.\n\nFirst, Democratic voters are extremely happy with the field as is. According to a July poll by the Pew Research Center, 65 percent of Democrats rate their field as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood.\u201d That\u2019s essentially tied with 2008 for the highest enthusiasm Pew has ever found among Democrats:\n\nDemocrats really like their 2020 choices Percentage of Democrats* with each opinion of that cycle\u2019s presidential primary field Cycle Poor Only fair Good Excellent 2020 5% 25% 42% 23% 2016 12 36 37 14 2008 2 29 49 15 2004 5 39 40 4 1992 11 38 24 3 * Includes registered voters who identified as Democrats or \u201cleaned\u201d toward the Democratic Party. The Pew surveys were conducted in the year before each election \u2014 in July for 2020, in September for 2016, 2008 and 2004, and in October for 1992. Source: Pew Research Center\n\nAnd the numbers may have only improved since then \u2014 a HuffPo/YouGov poll conducted last week found 83 percent of Democrats were satisfied with their choices.\n\nSecond, late-entering candidates don\u2019t exactly have a stellar track record. Remember Fred Thompson in 2008? Or Wesley Clark in 2004? Or even Rick Perry in 2012? Well, maybe not. These candidates were supposed \u201cwhite knights\u201d who entered their races late \u2014 and completely flopped. It\u2019s not easy running for president \u2014 setting up campaign offices, public relations teams, a fundraising apparatus, etc. all takes time \u2014 and it\u2019s no coincidence that the leading candidates got into the race early.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason that new 2020 contender talk is likely empty speculation: Democratic donors are supposedly concerned about the flaws of the current candidates, but the names they\u2019re floating are \u2026 deeply flawed. Democratic voters don\u2019t want a blast from the past like Hillary Clinton, for example; in polling of Iowa caucus-goers by the Des Moines Register from late last year, 72 percent of Democrats said Clinton would detract from the field. Brown is at least pretty popular, but polls of Bloomberg\u2019s favorable ratings show middling results at best.\n\nMoreover, Democratic voters prize electability. And Clinton and Kerry aren\u2019t exactly the first people you\u2019d associate with winning a general election. Conversely, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren all lead President Trump in general election polls. (No, you shouldn\u2019t take these polls too seriously, but they\u2019re worth considering in this context.)\n\nIn all, I\u2019d be very surprised if Clinton, Kerry, Bloomberg or any other big-name Democrat became a major factor in this race, let alone won the nomination. It\u2019s a little more feasible that donors dissatisfied with the front-runners will line up behind one of the candidates who is already running, such as Cory Booker or Amy Klobuchar.\n\nIn the end, though, I think this talk of Clinton or Bloomberg is a sign of two things: first, the media getting bored with the race and searching for a new storyline. And second, the establishment\u2019s influence is declining as candidates like Warren and Sanders are succeeding without taking their money. Some big donors might simply want back in on the action.\n\nWe\u2019re tracking impeachment polls; check them out!", "description": "This article is adapted from FiveThirtyEight\u2019s weekly \u201cDo You Buy That?\u201d segment on \u201cThis Week.\u201d The New York Times and The Washington Post recently reported th\u2026", "authors": ["Nate Silver"], "top_image": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/n2EevNE9jTWhb1eA-croppedtN8xH.jpg?w=575", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
