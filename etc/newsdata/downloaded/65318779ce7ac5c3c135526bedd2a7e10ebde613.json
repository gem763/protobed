(Wojtek Radwanski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nVice President Pence saluted the Polish people Sunday as they commemorated the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II, praising their courage during the \u201cfive decades of untold suffering and death that followed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is difficult for any of us who are not Poles to fathom the horrors that began here 80 years ago, on this day, the first of September 1939,\u201d Pence said solemnly, speaking in Pilsudski Square.\n\nHe added, \u201cWhile the hearts of every American are with our fellow citizens in the path of a massive storm, today we remember how the gathering storm of the 20th century broke into warfare and invasion followed by the unspeakable hardship and heroism shown by the Polish people.\u201d\n\nAs he recalled those sacrifices of the Polish people, Pence also remembered the \u201c16 million Americans who left the peace and comfort of home to fight, to liberate Europe.\u201d\n\nIt has been 80 years since Nazi Germany invaded Poland, sparking a conflict that wreaked devastation across Europe.\n\nPresident Trump had planned to make his second official visit to Poland this weekend and speak at the commemoration but last week asked Pence to attend in his place because of Hurricane Dorian.\n\n[Trump cancels trip to Poland, says he is staying in the U.S. to monitor Hurricane Dorian]\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attended the ceremony, along with other European officials. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited following tensions with Polish leaders.\n\nPence and Zelensky, a former comedian who was elected in April, met later Sunday. Pence did not respond to questions from reporters at the top of the meeting, including questions about whether the Trump administration would still allocate $250 million in planned security aid to Ukraine, which is being reconsidered, according to U.S. officials.\n\nBut as national security adviser John Bolton looked on, Pence broadly assured the Ukrainian president that \u201cwe will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine on your security, on territorial integrity, including Ukraine\u2019s rightful claim to Crimea.\u201d\n\nAttendees at the commemoration gathered in the sprawling square, waving Polish flags as a marching band played and soldiers marched. There was some scattered support for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign in the crowd, with one \u201cTrump 2020\u201d banner visible.\n\nPence\u2019s speech was heavy on themes of freedom and faith, quoting Pope John Paul II, who visited the same square during his historic trip to Poland in 1979, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the Soviet dissident and author.\n\nThe Polish experience since World War II, Pence said, proves \u201cwhere the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.\u201d\n\nPence criticized the \u201ctwisted ideologies of Nazism and Communism\u201d in which, he said, \u201call morality became socialist morality. Whatever served the power of the state and its slave masters became justified, even murder on an unprecedented scale.\u201d\n\nHe also called out the \u201cunspeakable evil of the Holocaust\u201d that \u201csystemically murdered more than 3 million of Poland\u2019s Jewish citizens.\u201d\n\nHovering over Pence\u2019s visit, however, is a friction point: Poland remains the only country in the European Union that does not have comprehensive legislation to deal with the restitution of private property confiscated by the Nazis \u2014 and, in Poland\u2019s case, later nationalized under communist rule.\n\nThe Trump administration has been slow to call out Poland\u2019s nationalist government as it chips away at democratic institutions, breaches the country\u2019s constitution and spurs anti-LGBTQ sentiment. Most recently, the country\u2019s deputy justice minister was forced to resign after it emerged that his ministry had waged a harassment campaign against judges resisting government efforts to control the judiciary.\n\nBut the Trump administration has weighed in on the issue of restitution of Jewish property, a matter that is politically fraught in Poland. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of 88 senators led by Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to press Poland to settle the issue.\n\n[As Pence heads to Poland for World War II anniversary, an 80-year-old issue remains unresolved]\n\nA White House official said last week that Pence hopes to come to an agreement with the Polish government in meetings Monday about cybersecurity and the next-generation 5G wireless network.\n\nAmid a trade dispute with China, the Trump administration has pushed European nations to punish Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, on national security grounds.\n\nPence is scheduled to have a bilateral meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Monday. Other issues on the agenda include the planned increase of U.S. troops in Poland, which has riled Russia, and visa requirements for Poles traveling to the United States.\n\nLoveday Morris and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Leaders from Germany, Ukraine and other countries joined the vice president at the commemoration.
