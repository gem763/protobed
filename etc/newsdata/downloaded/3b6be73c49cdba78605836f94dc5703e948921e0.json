Around that time, some of Firtash\u2019s associates began to use his broad network of Ukraine contacts to get damaging information on Biden, the people said.\n\nDiGenova and Toensing have billed Firtash about $1 million for their work, one of the people said. That includes costs for Lev Parnas, a Giuliani associate, as a translator and important contact, the person said. Parnas was arrested last week along with several associates and accused of conspiring to violate campaign-finance laws.\n\nPeople working on Firtash\u2019s behalf collected a witness statement from Viktor Shokin, a former Ukrainian prosecutor-general. The statement, dated early September, helped Giuliani renew an assertion that he\u2019d been advancing for months -- that Biden had tried in 2016 to sway Ukrainian politics to help his son. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have disputed Shokin\u2019s account.\n\nShokin, though, had been promised his statement wouldn\u2019t be made public, according to the people. Giuliani went on to cite it repeatedly, waving it around on cable news as evidence of Biden\u2019s alleged corruption. The Hill and other media outlets provided links to it, with Giuliani later suggesting he had a role in making it public. \u201cThis is the affidavit I put out,\u201d he said during a Fox News interview this month.\n\nAs a result of the publicity Giuliani generated with Shokin\u2019s statement, two of the people said they believe the odds of the Justice Department dropping the case against Firtash have plummeted, because it would look like a quid pro quo. Others connected to the case agreed.\n\nU.S. lawmakers conducting a presidential impeachment inquiry are bearing down on whether favors were traded for influence. They are examining Giuliani\u2019s efforts to turn up evidence in Ukraine and allegations that the Trump administration withheld crucial aid until the country\u2019s president agreed to investigate the Bidens.\n\nGeorge Kent, the deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs, testified to Congressional investigators this week that Giuliani asked the State Department and the White House around January to grant a visa to Shokin so he could travel to the U.S., CNN reported on Saturday. The effort failed after the State Department objected, though Giuliani eventually spoke with Shokin over Skype, CNN said.\n\nPolitical Aid\n\nIf indeed Firtash\u2019s camp aided the Trump political machine, that could be a problem. American politicians cannot accept foreign campaign contributions, and as Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation has laid out, even non-monetary assistance can have a value.\n\nIn a statement from his spokesman, Firtash denied having contact with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani, in a text message, wrote: \u201cI have nothing to do with Firtash case. Never met him and don\u2019t know him.\u201d\n\nAsked about whether Shokin\u2019s statement may have harmed Firtash\u2019s chances of getting the case dropped, Giuliani responded, \u201cIt would seem to me it should have nothing to do with it. It\u2019s either a good case or not.\u201d\n\nToensing and diGenova, a husband-and-wife law team, declined to comment through a spokesman. The Justice Department also declined to comment.\n\nGiuliani was an attractive ally for Firtash. Once renowned for his work as a U.S. prosecutor and a New York mayor, he was a close adviser to Trump and became his personal lawyer in April 2018. He also brought extensive contacts in Republican-leaning legal circles.\n\nA Ukrainian industrialist with natural gas interests, Firtash was looking to get out from under five years of legal headaches in the U.S. Federal prosecutors have accused him of corruption and racketeering conspiracy. He\u2019s accused of participating in a scheme to bribe Indian officials to secure titanium that would be sold to Boeing Co.\n\nArrested in Vienna on the U.S. charges in March 2014, he posted $174 million in bail and pledged to remain in Austria during extradition proceedings. The Justice Department has described Firtash as an associate of \u201cRussian organized crime.\u201d He has denied all the charges.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Associates of a Ukrainian oligarch fighting extradition to the U.S. were working to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden last summer in an effort to get Rudy Giuliani\u2019s help in the oligarch\u2019s legal case, according to three people familiar with the exchanges.Dmitry Firtash, charged", "authors": ["Stephanie Baker", "Irina Reznik"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ypO3M5edz0zpyiHUBVnkwA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/d972d219665157f82950c43d156ee1e4", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
