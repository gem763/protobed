Ernie Johnson makes a point of introducing him in the clip below by noting how often O\u2019Neal travels there. There\u2019s a 50-foot statue of Shaq in Beijing, for cripes sake.\n\nSo, as you watch, bear in mind that he\u2019s leaving money on the table too by taking this position. Didn\u2019t stop him from taking it.\n\nHis point is simple. We understand China\u2019s values and look the other way at them, why can\u2019t they do the same for us? If LeBron and Adam Silver can shrug off mass internment of religious minorities in concentration camps, the ChiCom government might reasonably be expected to shrug off one g-ddamned tweet by a team executive in support of Hong Kong. The reason this NBA/China standoff resonates is precisely because Americans on both sides of the aisle worry that Chinese economic power is pressuring American corporations like the NBA into following Chinese standards of free speech. That point seems to escape Johnson, who chides Morey for making trouble while there were NBA players in China (i.e. he turned them into rude guests), and Charles Barkley, who\u2019s laser-focused on the bottom line. Barkley in particular can\u2019t seem to see that the reason this has become a minor international incident isn\u2019t because Morey made it one but because China did. They could have ignored his pro-Hong-Kong tweet. Instead they chose to seize on it and bludgeon the league with it to send the message that further dissent won\u2019t be tolerated. All Chuck can do, seemingly, is cheer them on.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the other takeaway from this clusterfark. It\u2019s not merely that the ChiComs are demanding silence from Americans about their political crises, it\u2019s that they\u2019ve coopted NBA personalities into taking the Chinese government\u2019s position. Barkley places 100 percent of the blame for this incident on Morey, not an iota on Chinese totalitarianism, just as Beijing itself would. He also goes on and on about how poor LeBron James was unfairly forced to say something when James had nothing to do with Morey\u2019s tweet. Remember what LeBron *did* say, though, once he finally chose to speak up \u2014 accusing Morey of not necessarily being \u201ceducated\u201d about the politics of the Hong Kong situation. That\u2019s a talking point straight from the Chinese government, aimed at marginalizing critics by painting them as somehow not seeing the nuance in a basic demand for human rights. If LeBron wanted to wimp out to protect his business interests by simply declining comment, he could have done that. Instead he took China\u2019s side.\n\nWhich is what this is ultimately about. Shaq wants a live-and-let-live approach where China does what it wants and Americans say what they want and both sides live with it. China says no. Either Americans tacitly approve of their totalitarianism by maintaining total silence about it or they don\u2019t do business with China. Barkley and James side with China. Simple as that.\n\nKudos to TNT for giving this topic some time on the season\u2019s opening night, though. Meanwhile in China, the Lakers/Clippers game was aired \u2014 but the Raptors/Pelicans contest was not. The TV blackout of NBA games over there is still partially in effect, it seems. I guess airing the Lakers game was LeBron\u2019s reward for choosing the right side.", "description": "\"Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say, 'That's not right.'\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/so.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
