But the change has not come. And when the frontline is gone, we are doomed. there is no undoing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you continue to watch, unsympathetic to island nations, this realisation will soon come: that you stood by and witnessed the world cross the critical tipping point, ushering in the death of our planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a human species we need the earth to survive, but make no mistake, the earth doesn\u2019t need us.\u201d\n\nMomoa ended his address by shouting \u201cK\u016b Kia\u2019i Mauna\u201d, a support for the effort to stop a 30-meter telescope being built on Mauna Kea, Hawaii\u2019s tallest mountain.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Esposito"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-30-at-10.49.10-am.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
