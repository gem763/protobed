It was a dark day and one that Americans will never forget.\n\nLawmakers and power players responded to the shooting by pursuing a series of gun control measures. Others, like Sandy Hook Promise, a campaign \"designed to train students and adults to know the signs of gun violence,\" started posting a series of PSA videos in the wake of the tragedy. They debuted the latest one on \"TODAY,\" on Wednesday.\n\nThe ad, \"Back to School Essentials,\" depicts a group of students preparing for their classes with their \"perfect\" new materials, when suddenly they hear the sound of gunshots. The students start running for their lives or take cover to escape the mass shooter. In one scene, a young girl is using her new socks as a tourniquet for her friend's bloody wound.\n\nMost outlets have used the word \"chilling\" to describe the video.\n\nThe ad has many people wondering, is this the \"new normal?\"\n\nNot everyone agrees with Sandy Hook Promise's approach, or even their campaign at large. That's including some of the young victims' surviving family members. JT Lewis, who lost a brother in Sandy Hook, said that the group does not speak for him, nor several other affected families.\n\nHaving lost a brother in the Sandy Hook shooting, I want it to be clear that the \u201cSandy Hook Promise\u201d doesn\u2019t speak for me!\n\n\n\nThe organization is run by 2 families of victims, but most of us stay far away. They don\u2019t make that clear. We had to write a joint statement at one point \u2014 JT Lewis (@thejtlewis) September 18, 2019\n\nHe also fears that Sandy Hook Promise's campaign will have the opposite intended effect.", "description": ".09/18/2019 19:20:21PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/261/180a4fb8-40e9-41f3-9fcb-f8862ce5989e.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
