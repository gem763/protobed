The White House is not objecting to his appearance but has instructed him not to answer questions about his communications with the president. (See the letter of White House counsel Pat Cipollone to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler.)\n\nThis raises an interesting question: May the president assert executive privilege to shield disclosure of his communications with people who are not part of the White House staff and the broader executive branch?\n\nLewandowski was not a government official in June and July 2017, when, according to the Mueller report, the president instructed him to convey a directive to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The directive was for Sessions to narrow his recusal from the Russia investigation so that he could limit then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s jurisdiction \u2013 such that Mueller could investigate only to prevent Russian meddling in future elections.\n\nCOMBATIVE LEWANDOWSKI FRUSTRATES DEMOCRATS, AS IMPEACHMENT-PROBE HEARING DESCENDS INTO DISARRAY\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThat is, Mueller would end his probe of Kremlin interference in the 2016 campaign, on the rationale that Trump had done nothing wrong. Sessions was to add that he had been with Trump for nine months on the campaign and therefore knew that \u201cthere were no Russians involved with him.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe last claim was an overstatement. We now know that the Trump organization was involved in negotiations for Trump Tower Moscow throughout the 2016 campaign. Moreover, while there is no evidence that candidate Trump himself was informed about the matter, his top campaign officials (his son Don Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his then-campaign manager Paul Manafort) met in June 2016 with a lawyer they understood to be a Kremlin emissary (Natalia Veselnitskaya, with an entourage of Russians in tow) in the expectation (unfulfilled) of receiving campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n\nIronically, as I further detail in \u201cBall of Collusion,\u201d Veselnitskaya obtained the materials she presented from Fusion GPS, the same outfit that was working for Clinton to scrounge up campaign dirt on Donald Trump from Russian sources.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW", "description": "May the president assert executive privilege to shield disclosure of his communications with people who are not part of the White House staff and the broader executive branch?", "authors": ["Andrew Mccarthy", "Andrew C.
