Darcy was so kind and the memories I have are of her when she was thinking about other people.\n\n\u201cWe gave her some pocket money and told her she could spend it on anything she wanted and she chose some little slippers for Bea.\"\n\n\u201cI speak about her all the time. There will never be a time when she is not spoken about to Bea. It\u2019s important that she knows all about her sister.\n\n\u201cThe house is full of pictures and it feels like there is a connection between them. If you put a picture of Darcy in front of Bea, she smiles like she knows who she is.\n\n\u201cDarcy was like an old head on young shoulders, we would go for walks and ask her what she was doing and she would say things like \u2018just admiring the view\u2019.\u201d\n\n\"The most devastating thing is that Darcy did not get to spend enough time with Bea, because that was the thing she was most excited about. They would have been the best of friends.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\nEmily and her partner-of-five-years, Kristian D'Rosario, 30, of Malton, North Yorkshire, have launched a clothing brand Love Darcy Clothing in her memory.\n\nThe family have raised more than \u00a33,000 to raise awareness of the work of Martin House Hospice for Children, in Wetherby, North Yorkshire.\n\nSix weeks after she was born, Darcy was diagnosed with VACTERL Association, which is a rare condition when a rare group of symptoms appear together.\n\nThese symptoms include vertebral defects, anorectal anomalies - affecting the anus and rectum - cardiac defects, trachea-oesphageal fistula, which are rare conditions of the oesophagus and windpipe, renal abnormalities and limb abnormalities.\n\nAlthough no signs of what was to come were detected during pregnancy, Darcy was born with a missing radial bone in her forearm and thumb, and at six weeks old medics detected a heart murmur.\n\nLiving in Kent at the time, Darcy was referred to London\u2019s Royal Brompton Hospital where, after also finding issues with her bowel, doctors diagnosed her with VACTERL Association.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\nAs a result, during her short life, she had 20 operations altogether, on her limbs and bowel, as well as five lots of open heart surgery, the first to close a hole in her heart and the rest to treat pulmonary stenosis, a narrowing of the heart valve which affects the functioning of the heart, requiring surgery to cut away excess tissue.\n\nShe also had a colostomy bag until she was three years old.\n\nStepdad Kristian, who adored Darcy and had helped care for her since she was 18 months old, said: \u201cWe spoke to her like an adult about her condition. We wanted to make sure she was comfortable and understood what was going on.\n\n\u201cShe was so calm about it, whenever she was in hospital she knew it was because she needed looking after.\n\n\u201cEven after having open heart surgery, within a few hours she wanted to get up and go to the playroom. That\u2019s what she was like.\n\n\u201cThe main problem was that it made her tired, because her heart was working harder than it should have been. She wasn\u2019t allowed to play as much as the other children, which was really hard for her.\n\n\u201cIf she overdid it, a few days later she would have no energy.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\n\u201cBut, despite everything, we had been told that she would make it to adulthood. There was never any talk about her not getting to that stage.\u201d\n\nSadly, during the final quarter of 2018, Darcy's health took a turn for the worse.\n\nWhile she was waiting for heart surgery, her parents took her to A&E five times in two months, complaining of stomach pains.\n\nWith her immune system weakened, medics thought she probably had a urine infection or a virus.\n\nBut on January 24, she blacked out while Kristian was getting her ready for school.\n\nTaking her first to the GP, they soon found themselves being taken by ambulance to York Hospital, where her condition was monitored.\n\nKristian recalled: \u201cShe had no energy. We knew she was not well because she didn\u2019t eat much of her dinner, which was her favourite, macaroni cheese, and she offered her ice cream to Emily, which was not like her at all.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\n\u201cAt about 4am the following day she woke up then sort of blacked out again. I ran to get the nurse and about 20 people came into the room.\n\n\u201cShe had become breathless and was struggling for air. She was essentially having a cardiac arrest.\n\n\u201cThe medics tried to resuscitate her and worked on her for about 45 minutes, but she didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nShe was pronounced dead at 5am that morning, which was the same time Bea had been born in the same hospital five days earlier.\n\nEmily recalled: \u201cDarcy had been sat up talking to me about playing a few hours earlier. Then, in a flash, she was gone. I remember it clearly, I stepped back to let the medics work on her and she was very much aware of what was going on.\n\n\u201cI remember she said, \u2018Where\u2019s my mummy?\u2019 She wanted me to be in front of her. The moment she passed away she was looking right into my eyes, like she knew and didn\u2019t want to leave without seeing me.\n\n\u201cShe said right beforehand, \u2018I want to go home, Mummy.\u2019\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\nKristian and I have spoken about that moment and whether she meant go home to her house, or that she wanted to go to heaven. We think maybe she had had enough. She'd had that many operations in her short life that maybe it took too much of a toll on her body.\n\n\u201cBea was in the room with us, so we were all with her.\n\n\"It\u2019s so devastating to think that one moment Darcy was in hospital and we did not think she was as poorly as she was and the next, our lives had been turned upside down.\"\n\nA post-mortem found Darcy had died of a cardiac arrest, due to an infection that had got into her bloodstream, called a cardiobacterium. It can be present in the mouth, nose and throat, or heart valves.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave at the end of five days. We got to spend time with her and have photographs taken, including some of her and Bea to show her when she\u2019s older.\u201d\n\nKristian added: \"We were able to make artwork from her hands and feet.\n\n\u201cKnowing she was in the same place as us was really comforting.\u201d\n\nDarcy was buried at New Malton cemetery, just down the road from the family home, so they can visit her every day.\n\nThe most tragic thing for them is knowing that Bea will grow up not knowing her big sister and that Darcy will never get to have the relationship she was so looking forward to.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\nKristian said: \u201cDarcy had always wanted to be a big sister, all her friends at school had baby brothers and sisters.\n\n\u201cShe had given us strict instructions that we were not allowed to have a boy. She desperately wanted a sister, so it was a relief to us when we found out we were having a girl. Darcy came with us to the scan and her reaction when she found out was buzzing. She was so happy.\u201d\n\nBea was born two weeks early on January 19 weighing 6lb 12oz.\n\nBecause she was premature, Emily and Bea spent two days in York Hospital as a precaution, before being allowed home.\n\nKristian said: \u201cWe always say that Bea came two weeks early, so she had the chance to meet her big sister.\n\n\u201cDarcy was very protective over her. She wanted to be the only one to look after her.\n\n\u201cBea came with us when Darcy was admitted. She was really excited to have her baby sister there. When she was feeling okay she would sit up and stare at her, but she had no energy to be able to cuddle or hold her.\n\n\u201cThe hardest thing about having Bea is that everything is so bittersweet. Everything that is a first for her is also a first for missing Darcy, if that makes sense.\n\n\u201cIt would have been Darcy\u2019s 7th birthday in August and this was the first one we had without her.\n\n\u201cEverything is so difficult. We try to be positive and put a brave face on it because we need to keep going for Bea, but there\u2019s so much sadness for us all, too.\n\n\u201cStill, we are determined that Bea will grow up knowing Darcy and how much her big sister loved her.\n\n\"And, as she grows, we will see our beloved Darcy living on through her.\"\n\nVisit www.lovedarcyclothing.com and www.darcy-roger.muchloved.com", "description": "Darcy, from Malton, North Yorkshire, braved \n20 operations and five open heart surgeries in her short life after being diagnosed with VACTERL Association", "authors": ["Harriet Whitehead", "Neil Murphy", "Image", "Pa Real Life Collect"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537621.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Emily-Nixon-Tragic-death.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
