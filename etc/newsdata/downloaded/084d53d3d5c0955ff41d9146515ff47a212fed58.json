It is a mixture of social revenge and laziness. Whatever your thoughts about the public school system it is undeniable that they perform better than state schools. Instead of trying to hide this excellence by getting rid of it, surely it would be better as a benchmark to which to aspire.\n\nTeachers\u2019 salaries do not vary much between the two systems, nor does the heavy burden of work, which is on average around 50 hours per week. The difference is that the private sector is much less occupied with the onerous bureaucracy that is imposed on state schools, occupying an inordinate amount of time better spent in teaching. The greatest asset that the state schools have is the vocation and dedication of the teachers, but instead of being nurtured they are systematically abused by successive governments for whom counterproductive targets and meaningless or manipulated statistics take priority.\n\nIf the private school system is to be abolished, then first bring the state schools up to its high standards, rather than dragging everyone down to the lowest common denominator.\n\nBetter to have standards equally high than equally low.\n\nMatt Minshall\n\nNorfolk\n\nThomas Cook and the EU\n\nThose British travellers left abroad due to the collapse of Thomas Cook must be thankful that the UK is still in the EU, although not for much longer, and the protection our membership affords.\n\nUnder the EU Package Travel Directive from 11 December 2015, tour operators have been required as of 1 July 2018 to ensure their customers are repatriated. The directive also provides travellers who have booked a package holiday with a refund before departure, in case a company files for bankruptcy.\n\nThis obligation aims to reduce the financial losses incurred by travellers and is yet another example of the benefits afforded by our membership of the EU, which many Brexiteers view as Brussels-imposed red tape.\n\nAlex Orr\n\nEdinburgh\n\nPlease, no general election\n\nSurely no one \u2013 possibly not even Boris Johnson \u2013 is looking forward with pleasure to a general election in the run-up to Christmas. A cathartic Final Say referendum in the New Year, however, would be welcomed.\n\nMay I suggest that MPs get on and pass a new law to hold a second referendum? Please?\n\nHelen Bore\n\nScalby", "description": "It has been suggested by some that the recent Supreme Court ruling\u00a0was a victory for the establishment over the rights of the ordinary working class person.
