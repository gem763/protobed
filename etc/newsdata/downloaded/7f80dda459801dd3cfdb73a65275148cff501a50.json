It\u2019s not impossible. After all, other low-wage countries are eager to take over China\u2019s role and keep the products flowing (no, those jobs won\u2019t be coming to the U.S.). Apple may have a big adjustment to make but also has big profit margins to absorb the cost. China still wants American technology. Boeing jetliners won\u2019t be easily replaced. If China buys Brazilian soybeans, Brazil\u2019s existing customers will have to buy soybeans elsewhere. For these reasons, I suspect a decoupling in U.S.-China trade relations would be less damaging, say, than any that might follow from Mr. Trump\u2019s occasional threats to impose heavy tariffs on Japan and Europe to blow up the supply chains of an integrated world-wide auto industry.\n\nUsing tariffs as a 2-by-4 to get Beijing\u2019s attention was always risky. Getting a satisfactory agreement from China may never have been possible. Now we\u2019re stuck with the tariffs, which having risen to over 20% are enough to force a major relocation of production for the U.S. market out of China in ways that only weaken the U.S. hand in the long run.\n\nIf you could peer into Donald Trump \u2019s brain, you would likely find his trade war is partly inspired by Reagan\u2019s trade war with Japan, which he sees as having produced an unalloyed success when Japanese car makers shifted plants to the U.S. and employed U.S. workers.\n\nUnfortunately, any parallels are mostly illusory. The U.S. and Japan were allies. What Japanese firms gave up in U.S. market share, they got back in higher prices because Reagan\u2019s war was waged not with tariffs but cartel-like voluntary restraint agreements. To key Japanese interest groups, the outcome was highly acceptable. In contrast, if the only \u201cwin\u201d Mr. Trump offers Beijing is relief from tariffs that Mr. Trump himself imposed, he will get no deal. China\u2019s Communist Party is not in the business of showing that it can be coerced. (And Hong Kong isn\u2019t helping.)\n\nMr. Trump came to Washington with an economic ace in his hand. He was not Barack Obama ; he could count on a business honeymoon by letting deregulatory flowers bloom and otherwise keeping his ambitions in check. Market maven Bob Doll spoke for many when he said at the time stocks would be up as long as \u201cgrowth Donald Trump\u201d prevails over \u201cprotectionist Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nOpinion Live: America\u2019s Political Realignment and the 2020 Election Join Paul Gigot in Los Angeles on Wednesday, October 1 for a discussion with Opinion columnists and political experts on the current state of the 2020 election field. Register with WSJ+.\n\nAlas, Mr. Trump\u2019s politics is not a coalition-based politics. His is a ratings-based politics. A ratings-based politics needs a story line, and the Trump story line has been Trump vs. the double-talkers, the non-doers. Not that his trampling over sensitivities and taboos in pursuit of attention has been entirely without value. He has put the failures of our immigration system front and center where the American people can\u2019t ignore them. Nancy Pelosi may mock his slogan of \u201cmake America great again,\u201d but I doubt any Democrat will be in a hurry to give back gains in Europe\u2019s commitment to funding its own defense or to revert to a policy of tolerating China\u2019s exploitative behavior.\n\nMr. Trump won\u2019t be setting any records for administrative efficiency or policy subtlety, however, and his strategic thinking lacks depth. He seems to have set out on his tariff war without any clear idea of what was likely to happen. Now his administration will have to start rationalizing the consequences of a U.S.-China economic divorce that he may not have sought.\n\nAmerica will need to learn to protect its strategic technology, not just plead with China not to steal it. But it\u2019s hard to see how the U.S. gains much from piling up tariffs on ordinary Chinese consumer exports. We only lose long-term leverage. The U.S. needs to start playing the interdependence-plus-rivalry game more clearheadedly than Mr. Trump has in his first term.\n\nAssuming the domestic jobs boom survives the rough seas he has inflicted on it, will Trumpian politics work in 2020? His performance in the 2016 debates, many have forgotten, was objectively awful. He won by being a novelty, by being disruptive and nonconformist through a crowded GOP primary and then by not being Hillary Clinton for the final lap.\n\nBut a surprise may be at hand. Serving as president has been an education for Mr. Trump as it would be for anybody. His rhetorical instincts may be unchanged but he can\u2019t help having picked up a degree of knowledge about public policy and how government functions. This unwonted expertise already has begun audibly leaking into his unscripted responses to press questions. Don\u2019t discount the possibility that Mr. Trump\u2019s debates with Kamala Harris or whomever won\u2019t be the gong show you\u2019re expecting. His case for his China policy might even become compelling once he figures out what it is.", "description": "The Trump China policy has fixed no problem, but the recovery can survive it.", "authors": ["Holman W.
