Although doctors predicted a 50 percent chance of survival, Still and his family found hope and looked to God to help them through the difficult time, he explained.\n\n\"It's tough for any parent...because you want it to be 100 percent...you want to do everything you can to protect your children, but sometimes you put in a position where you can't, and the only thing you can really do is just lean on our heavenly doctor and hope that he brings our child through that storm,\" said Still.\n\nDEVON STILL ON GIVING UP HIS NFL CAREER TO BE WITH DAUGHTER AFTER CANCER DIAGNOSIS\n\nStill, who had played 18 games during his first two years in Cincinnati, put his football career on hold while Leah underwent treatment. After a series of surgeries, the cancerous tumors were successfully removed and she has been in remission since.\n\n\"There was still a chance, and we were gonna go out there and give it our best...because things can change suddenly, and we just thank God that it changed for the better,\" Still said, reflecting on that time.\n\nStill described himself as someone who \"always knew God, but didn't have a relationship with him.\" His wife suggested that he \"get back into the church\" after he obtained numerous injuries and was facing a particularly difficult time, he explained.\n\nDEVON STILL NEW CAREER: TRYING TO TACKLE CHILDHOOD CANCER\n\n\"My wife had approached me and she that something was missing from my life, that we needed to do something different because whatever we were doing wasn't working,\" he said. \"So she came up with the idea that we needed to get back into the church....that's what we did. And it was the best decision that you know, I ever made.\"\n\nLeah's diagnosis came two months later, and he credits his return to God as his strength throughout the trying time.\n\n\"I felt like it was just perfect time because two months later, I was hit with, you know, a storm that I'd never seen coming,\" he said.\n\n\"Trust in God, like we did... no matter what the odds are.\" \u2014 Devon Still, on Fox Nation\n\nHoping to inspire others, Still often speaks out about his story, and encourages those struggling to turn to God for salvation.\n\nJACK BREWER OPENS UP ABOUT HIS JOURNEY TO FINDING GOD\n\n\"If there is somebody out there going through trials and tribulations, I would just say to trust in God, like we did... no matter what the odds are,\" he said.\n\nTo hear more NFL stars open up about their faith and for more from Still on his past, career, and journey to God, join Fox Nation and watch the exclusive \"Ainsley's Bible Study\" today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
