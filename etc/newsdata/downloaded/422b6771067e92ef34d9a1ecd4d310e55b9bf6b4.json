The symptoms of mono include an enlarged spleen and can last for weeks. Darnold would risk rupturing his spleen if he took a hard hit on the field.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, before being ruled out for the week, Darnold put his status rather bluntly.\n\n\"It's a tough thing, because you want to stay safe. I want to make sure that I'm safe out there and I'm not going to die,\" Darnold said.\n\nThe illness has delayed what many expected to be a season of growth for the second-year quarterback and the upstart Jets. The Jets have started the season 0-3.\n\nJets head coach Adam Gase said on Thursday the team has been in constant communication with Darnold, checking in on how he's feeling.\n\n\"There's a lot of communication going on with him,\" Gase said. \"It's constant. We're checking with him: How are you feeling? Are you tired? What's your conditioning like? We keep talking to him. We keep watching him.\"\n\nOn Friday, he said Darnold simply wasn't ready.\n\n\"The labs didn't come back the way we were hoping,\" Gase said. \"I know Sam is disappointed, but we'll be able to adjust and work quickly.\"\n\nSecond-string quarterback Trevor Siemian suffered a season-ending ankle injury in Week 2 while filling in for Darnold. Third-string quarterback Luke Falk will make his second straight start in Week 5. He has not yet thrown for a touchdown in 47 passing attempts.", "description": "Sam Darnold wasn't medically cleared to play in Week 5, as he continues to deal with the effects of mono.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d97755e9386bc107640c85e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
