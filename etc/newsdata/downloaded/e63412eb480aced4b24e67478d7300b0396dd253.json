He reportedly discussed \"free expression, unfair treatment of conservatives, fact checking, partnerships, and privacy\" with prominent right-wing critics of Facebook, including Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Washington Examiner correspondent Byron York, and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.\n\nAlso on rt.com Facebook CEO warns breaking up Big Tech will lead to more 'election meddling' and less censorship will hurt people in LEAKED audio\n\nThis, the mainstream media and many liberals on social media have declared, is an outrage. The hashtag #DeleteFacebook was trending for most of Monday as Woke Twitter finally realized the fourth-richest man in the US, who infamously called Facebook users \"dumb f***s,\" was an unworthy trustee of their digital lives. Just kidding \u2013 they were upset that the platform had become yet another tool of white supremacy.\n\nTo more accurately reflect its ideology, Facebook should change its name to Fascistbook.\n\n\n\nAfter baby pics \u2014 ppl sharing far right conspiracies, swastikas, confederate flags, MAGA hats, and incels flashing white power 'ok' signs are the next most popular posts. #DeleteFacebook \u2014 Bill Madden (@maddenifico) October 14, 2019\n\n\"The fear is that Zuckerberg is trying to appease the Trump administration by not cracking down on right-wing propaganda,\" an anonymous \"cybersecurity researcher and former government official based in Silicon Valley\" told Politico, giving voice to the fears of many in the Democratic Party. Last week, the platform refused 2020 presidential frontrunner Joe Biden's campaign's request to remove a Trump campaign ad accusing Biden of promising Ukraine $1 billion to fire a prosecutor investigating the gas company that had hired his son. While Facebook promised that any \"viral hoax\" shared by a politician would be \"demoted\" and displayed alongside a fact-check, it pointed to a recently-revised policy against fact-checking \"political speech\" as the reason its hands were tied, leaving the Biden campaign \u2013 and the #Resistance \u2013 fuming.\n\nWounded liberals took to Twitter to voice their displeasure with Zuckerberg's secret meetings, accusing Facebook of \"poisoning our democracy\" even as they made excuses for why they couldn't delete Instagram or WhatsApp, both of which are owned by Facebook.\n\nYes, I still use Instagram and WhatsApp, and yes I feel shitty about it because I think Mark Zuckerberg is an amoral piece of shit, but at least Instagram hasn't specifically poisoned our democracy like Facebook has. #DeleteFacebook \u2014 Bridget Todd \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udfff (@BridgetMarie) October 14, 2019\n\nI stopped actively posting on @Facebook in 2016 after it was revealed that it helped elect the orange fecal smear. Now #DeleteFacebook seems like the best course of action. Yes, I\u2019m still on IG but I feel it does less to push the trump agenda. Less older white supremacists. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb https://t.co/D5jOTqjyAQ \u2014 yvette nicole brown (@YNB) October 14, 2019\n\nZuckerberg sitting down with conservatives is an odd straw to have break the camel's back, to be sure. Facebook users sat quietly by when it emerged that the platform had shared their private data, including messages sent to other users, with over 150 corporate \"partners\" without their knowledge or consent. There was no user uprising when the platform was discovered to be collaborating with phone companies to rate customers' \"creditworthiness\" based on their profiles. #DeleteFacebook didn't trend when the platform quietly suspended tens of thousands of apps for violating users' privacy and admitted it would be unable to catch all of the other perpetrators, or when a Facebook lawyer made the jaw-dropping claim that users have no expectation of privacy at all.\n\nAlso on rt.com Facebook\u2019s latest data breach feeds a list of HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of its privacy abuse victims\n\nFacebook notoriously collaborates with the US government to remove accounts both domestically and abroad, and works with the Israeli government to stifle the free speech of Palestinians, many of whom get their news exclusively through Facebook. A recent EU court ruling paved the way for Facebook to be weaponized by European countries to remove so-called \"hate speech\" by users halfway around the world. And Facebook has even struggled to play down complaints that it exploits children by luring them into spending wads of their parents' cash on online games.\n\nNone of these offenses rankled #Resistance Twitter as much as a friendly (off-the-record) dinner with Tucker Carlson. Users attacked the \"hateful, dangerous platform\" as \"irresponsible\" and slammed it for \"undermining democracy.\" But even liberals have admitted, when polled about other issues, that Facebook content favors the Democratic Party, and formeremployees have admitted to suppressing conservative posts. Wouldn't it be ironic if the company that has abused its users in every way imaginable was finally kicked to the curb for listening to their complaints and trying to change?\n\nBy Helen Buyniski, RT\n\nLike this story?
