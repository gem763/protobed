More To Come", "language": "en", "text": "A social worker and journalist from Bhopal filed an RTI application addressing the Postal Department seeking information about the post office, its premises and its housing complex. But in a rather strange occurrence, he has been continuously receiving responses from the department to its one question.\n\nJitendra Surana, so far, has received as many as 360 responses to a question he asked in his RTI application.\n\n\"I filed an online RTI application seeking information about the market value and book value of immovable properties of the postal department. The department asked the Chief Postmaster and all the Postmasters General,\" Surana told IANS.\n\nThe Times Of India\n\n\"The responsibility to answer the RTI was given to the Post Superintendent despite the higher officials. They were instructed to provide the information of their respective offices directly to the applicant. So many responses started flooding in after they started sending the information one by one that it has become troublesome for me,\" he said.\n\nFor the past few days, Surana is getting more than 10 responses on a daily basis. He filed the RTI application online on August 7, 2019 and the responses are being sent to him through post since August 13, 2019.\n\nDon't Miss 501 SHARES 452 SHARES 3.9 K SHARES 530 SHARES\n\nIn a day, the maximum number of responses that he has received are 22 while five were the minimum.\n\nSurana has questioned the way his RTI application has been answered. He said that while the application has been filed online, why is he getting answers through post.\n\nHe alleged that most of the departments have not been able to understand the motive of RTI.\n\n\u201cThe postal department is the most recent example of this. They should have answered the application online but they are sending it through post. The head of the department should compile the data and provide comprehensive information but he gave the responsibility to the Post Superintendent,\u201d he said.", "description": "A social worker and journalist from Bhopal filed an RTI application addressing the Postal Department seeking information about the post office, its premises and its housing complex.
