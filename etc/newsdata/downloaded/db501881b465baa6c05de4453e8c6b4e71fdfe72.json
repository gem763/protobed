(AP) \u2014 The commonwealth\u2019s attorney of Norfolk, Virginia, says the city can remove a Confederate monument, despite a state law that bars the removal of war memorials.\n\nNews outlets report Attorney Gregory Underwood filed court documents Tuesday seeking to dismiss a city lawsuit that says the state law infringes on its right to free speech. Underwood says that he and state Attorney General Mark Herring don\u2019t believe the law applies to the city\u2019s 80-foot (24-meter) Confederate monument of a solider nicknamed \u201cJohnny Reb.\u201d\n\nThe 1904 law initially applied to counties and was expanded in 1997. However, the city\u2019s bronze monument was erected in 1907. In 2017, Herring issued an opinion that said the law didn\u2019t apply retroactively to statues erected before the law\u2019s expansion.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when the statue will be moved.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The commonwealth's attorney of Norfolk, Virginia, says the city can remove a Confederate monument, despite a state law that bars the removal of war memorials.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/Confederate_Monument-Norfolk_Lawsuit_23501.jpg-16952_c0-3-3000-1753_s1200x700.jpg?cd160c61002233da3f2a84c0829a05ec5953757b", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
