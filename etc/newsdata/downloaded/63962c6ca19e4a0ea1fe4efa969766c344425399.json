Many hide their pain in alcohol and drug abuse. Discrimination from the community leads to self-stigmatisation and we struggle to access the services and support we need. Even the LGBTI community see us as a problem, and turn us away so that we become someone else's problem.

This giraffe will be rehabilitated and return to the wild, as a number of others have done before him. Right now, giraffes are undergoing what has been referred to as a silent extinction. Current estimates are that giraffe populations across Africa have dropped 40 percent in three decades, plummeting from approximately 155,000 in the late 1980s to under 100,000 today. The decline is thought to be caused by to habitat loss and fragmentation and poaching, but because there haven't been long term conservation efforts in the past, it's hard to know exactly what is happening. Reticulated giraffes themselves number fewer than 16,000 individuals. Scientists are now undertaking major studies to better understand why giraffes are disappearing and what can be done to stop it.

None of the warriors had ever seen a rhino in their life and some had never even seen a photo of a rhino. Their eyes got wide and they became very protective of them.
