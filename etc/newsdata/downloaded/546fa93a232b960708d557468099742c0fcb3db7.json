Index providers FTSE Russell and MSCI are dramatically increasing the weight of mainland Chinese stocks, which will soon dominate their emerging-markets indexes. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have moved to gain majority control of joint ventures in China as the Chinese government increasingly opens its markets to foreign investors.\n\nBut few have been more open about the importance of China to their growth prospects as JPMorgan Chase JPM, +0.80%, the U.S.\u2019s largest bank, and BlackRock BLK, +1.13%, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager with nearly $7 trillion under management.\n\nTheir CEOs, Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink, have put China at the center of their global growth strategies \u2014 while also being leaders in the drive to push U.S. corporations to become more socially responsible. That flies in the face of China\u2019s Communist regime under president-for-life Xi Jinping, whose totalitarian policies conflict directly with core American principles of individual liberty and freedom of expression.\n\nAnd yet Wall Street is as mesmerized by the prospect of 1.4 billion consumers and investors with cash to spare as were many American industrial and technology companies that gave away the store to Chinese partners through intellectual property theft and other depredations.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe in the future prospects of China,\u201d a JPMorgan spokesperson wrote in an email. \u201cIt is a critical component of our growth plans, globally and in Asia. Our ongoing investments in China reflect our long-term commitment to one of the largest, fastest-growing and most exciting markets in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in. We\u2019re not slowing down,\u201d Dimon told Bloomberg earlier this year.\n\nIn his 2018 letter to shareholders, Fink called China \u201cone of the largest future growth opportunities for BlackRock.\u201d He said Asia would account for half of the industry\u2019s growth in assets under management over the next five years, \u201clargely driven by China.\u201d \u201cOur goal,\u201d he concluded, \u201cis to become one of the country\u2019s leading global asset managers.\u201d\n\nBut in 2017, JPMorgan put out a report on corporate responsibility, noting proudly that it was ranked No. 1 on Fortune\u2019s 2017 \u201cChange the World\u201d list, whose latest headline is \u201cDelivering on the Promise of Purpose Beyond Profits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are proud that our firm\u2019s corporate responsibility efforts are being recognized,\u201d the company said in the report. \u201dBut even more so, we are proud that we are making a real difference in our communities.\u201d\n\nAnd in August, the Business Roundtable, of which Dimon is chairman, got lots of buzz for a statement that committed its CEO members to run companies \u201cfor the benefit of all stakeholders \u2014 customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders\u201d\u2014not just shareholders.\n\nIn a January 2018 letter, Fink, who also is a member of the Business Roundtable, called on CEOs of big companies\u2014in which BlackRock is often a major investor\u2014to make big changes in corporate governance and do a better job serving their communities.\n\n\u201cSociety is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.\u201d\n\nTake that, Milton Friedman.\n\nNow: Read what Nasdaq\u2019s former CEO says about the Business Roundtable statement\n\nThose principles face a big test in China. Under Xi, the country has tightened its grip on its population, creating a high-tech surveillance state even George Orwell couldn\u2019t have imagined. In the far western province of Xinjiang, it has incarcerated up to two million Uighur Muslims in \u201cre-education camps\u201d where some have been tortured, sexually abused and forced to renounce Islam and pledge loyalty to the Communist Party, as the Council on Foreign Relations explains.\n\nChina has yet to crack down completely on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, but Xi recently warned, \u201cAnyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones.\u201d\n\nNice!\n\nJPMorgan Chase didn\u2019t respond to specific questions about its involvement in China.\n\nA BlackRock spokeswoman emailed remarks Fink had posted on LinkedIn about doing business with another bad actor, Saudi Arabia, as an example of the firm\u2019s concerns for human rights in countries in which it does business. \u201cThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi was horrifying,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is much Saudi Arabia needs to do to demonstrate that it is truly committed to reforms that strengthen the rule of law and the rights of all of its people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s good that he spoke out. BlackRock also says investing in China \u201cwill take time and patience.\u201d\n\nIt will take a lot more than that. For Wall Street, as for many U.S. companies, a big clash is coming between Chinese money and American values. I\u2019m not optimistic they\u2019re going to make the right choice.\n\nHoward R.
