According to an AFP report, the fire ravaged an area of over 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres) with authorities battling to bring it under control.\n\nPicture For Representation/Twitter\n\n\"The special importance of those koalas is that they are very genetically diverse,\" Sue Ashton, president of the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, told AFP.\n\nKoalas are at great risk from bush fires. If a Koala population is living in an area of bush land which is surrounded by development, a single fire can kill them all. Her fears are that \"hundreds\" in the known koala breeding area \"have perished in the fire\".\n\n\"It's a national tragedy because this koala population is so unique,\" she added.\n\nWarning: Disturbing footage. Viewer's discretion advised.\n\nPort Macquarie Koala hospital president, Sue Ashton, told AFP that even if koalas safely avoid a blaze, they can burn their paws and claws while climbing down from smouldering trees, which can leave them unable to climb properly again.\n\nDon't Miss 14.8 K SHARES 4.4 K SHARES 4.7 K SHARES 4.2 K SHARES 4.3 K SHARES\n\n\"If the fire intensifies and continues to burn up the tree \"they'll perish\", she added. \"So we won't really know until we get in there and start to look.\"\n\nThe fire has, so far, burnt out more than 2,000 hectares of bush land and is continuing to spread.\n\nSource\n\n\"The fire will continue to burn throughout the night, however there are significant resources in the area protecting properties,\" New South Wales Rural Fire Service said in their latest update.\n\nLand clearing and development over time has meant a loss of habitat for the tree-dwelling koalas, leading to less connectivity between populations, increased inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity of the marsupial.\n\nMore than 70 fires continue to burn across the state of New South Wales, which has been battling severe drought.", "description": "A bushfire believed to have been sparked by a lightning strike has claimed the lives of hundreds of Koalas in Australia's east coast.
