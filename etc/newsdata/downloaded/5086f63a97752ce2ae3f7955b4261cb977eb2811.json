The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed that Feige will develop an all-new Star Wars movie alongside Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy as part of multiple new projects set in the universe.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the projects Kathy and the Lucasfilm team are working on, not only in terms of Star Wars but also Indiana Jones and reaching into other parts of the company including Children of Blood and Bone with Emma Watts and Fox,\u201d Walt Disney Studios co-chairman and chief creative officer Alan Horn told THR. \u201cWith the close of the Skywalker Saga, Kathy is pursuing a new era in Star Wars storytelling, and knowing what a die-hard fan Kevin is, it made sense for these two extraordinary producers to work on a Star Wars film together.\u201d\n\nAccording to THR, Feige has told an unnamed \u201cmajor actor\u201d that he has a specific role in mind for them when the movie gets made, but otherwise there aren\u2019t any details. Other Star Wars projects in the works include separate feature trilogies from The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson and Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, while Jon Favreau\u2019s live-action series The Mandalorian is coming to Disney+ when the streaming service launches in November.", "description": "The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed that Feige will develop an all-new Star Wars movie alongside Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy as part of multiple new projects set in the universe.", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ma8weh9J6QKpibLsZHLMGF8bbpA=/0x135:4000x2229/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19233501/1163270491.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
