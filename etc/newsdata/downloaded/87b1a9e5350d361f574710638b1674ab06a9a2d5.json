Matt Gaetz (R-FL).\n\nAfter Abby Huntsman mentioned that Gaetz is reportedly filming a documentary series for HBO called The Swamp\u2014and allegedly broke House rules to get the crew members into the Capitol building, McCain went off.\n\n\u201cI hate political stunts across the board in general,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI think we elect people in order to serve in Congress.\u201d Comparing what Republicans did this week to the Democratic sit-in for gun control in 2016, she said, \u201cDemocrats shouldn\u2019t be doing it, Republicans shouldn't be doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe elect you to get your freaking job done one way or the other,\u201d McCain continued, \u201cand when you are sitting on a sit-in for 26 hours or you\u2019re doing what Republicans did yesterday, it\u2019s the reason why Congress has a 13 percent approval rating.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the way, Matt Gaetz, when did you become a TV star or wannabe a TV star?\u201d she asked in disgust. \u201cYou want to do that? Get the hell out of Congress! Get a TV job! But you\u2019re probably not interesting enough to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s going to hire him, he\u2019s boring,\u201d Joy Behar added.\n\nIt was a relatively rare moment of agreement between McCain and Behar, who said earlier of Republicans, \u201cI think they're scared because, you know, because Trump said that any never-Trumpers are considered \u2018scum.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they don't want to be labeled as scum in his eyes and they're afraid of getting thrown out of their job,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it's just based on pure, you know, fear\u2014just fear and cowardice in my opinion.\u201d", "description": "\u201cYou want to do that?
