See here, for examples. Starting with Chrome 77, they're now gone, and they'll soon be removed from Firefox too.\n\nGoogle said the EV indicators were rather useless at conveying information about the security and authenticity of the sites a user was accessing and removed them from the browser UI. Many security researchers agreed with Google's decision.\n\nEV information will still be available, but not presented to users in such a prominent space in the URL bar. Instead, it will be relegated to the drop-down panel that appears when pressing a site's green padlock indicator, next to the other TLS information.\n\nMany performance-geared updates\n\nBut if Chrome 77 had a central theme, that would be \"performance.\" This release includes several new features that had been added to help developers gauge the performance of how their sites are loading inside Chrome.\n\nThe most useful of these is a new metric called \"Largest Contentful Paint.\" This is available in Chrome's Developer Tools section. Developers can use it to measure the time Chrome takes to display a readable version of their site in the \"above-the-fold\" (user-visible) section of the browser, while the rest of the site still loads in the background.\n\nThe idea is to allow developers to optimize content that needs to load first and defer the loading of elements that aren't visible on-screen at first. Largest Contentful Paint will let developers know how much time it takes for their site to become visible to users, and work towards getting this metric down, rather than optimize performance metrics that don't usually mean anything to end-users.\n\nImage: Google\n\nNew Contact Picker\n\nFurther, Google is also testing a new UI element as part of its \"Origin Trials,\" a dashboard that lets users sign up for experimental features.\n\nCalled the Contact Picker API, this new UI element is a system through which websites can access and select contacts from a user's phone.\n\nGoogle said this new API has been one of its most demanded features. The new Contact Picker API will only be available for Chrome for Android, and a blog post detailing its features is available here.\n\nNew permanent Guest Mode\n\nThere is also another sneaky feature that's been added to Chrome's Policy List, a feature that lets system administrators enforce configurations for Chrome browsers across an enterprise.\n\nStarting with Chrome 77 there's a new policy named \"BrowserGuestModeEnforced.\"\n\n\"If this policy is set to enabled, Google Chrome will enforce guest sessions and prevents profile logins,\" Google said. \"Guest logins are Google Chrome profiles where all windows are in incognito mode.\"\n\nHome users who'd like to use this feature and force their Chrome browser to start in Guest mode all the time, can enable it by adding the command-line flag of \"--guest\" to the Chrome browser shortcut. (See here for the basics on how to add a command-line flag to Chrome).\n\nBut we only touched on the most interesting changes.
