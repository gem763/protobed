But the project has met with fierce community resistance, legal challenges, and continued funding difficulties.\n\nThe PNG government sunk more than 375m Kina (AUD$157m) into the project, money it is attempting, but appears unlikely, to recoup. The project has been \u201ca total failure\u201d prime minister James Marape said.\n\nDeep-sea mining to turn oceans into \u2018new industrial frontier\u2019 Read more\n\nDeepsea mining has proven contentious wherever it has been proposed and trialled across the world.\n\nProponents argue deep-sea mining could yield far superior ore to land mining \u2013 in silver, gold, copper, manganese, cobalt and zinc \u2013 with little, if any, waste product. The industry is potentially worth billions of dollars and could assist the transition to a renewable energy economy, supplying raw materials for key technologies such as batteries, computers and phones. Different mining methods exist, but most involve using converted terrestrial mining machinery to excavate materials from polymetallic nodules or hydrothermal vents on the sea floor, at depths of up to 6000 metres, then drawing a seawater slurry to ships on the surface. The slurry is then \u201cde-watered\u201d and transferred to another vessel for shipping. Extracted seawater is pumped back down and discharged close to the sea floor.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deep sea mining off Papua New Guinea coast : Rem Etive drill program 518 Photograph: Nautilus minerals\n\nEnvironmental and legal groups have urged extreme caution, arguing there are potentially massive \u2013 and unknown \u2013 ramifications for the environment and for nearby communities, and that the global regulatory framework is not yet drafted, and currently deficient. Scientists argue deep sea biodiversity and ecosystems remain understudied and poorly understood, making it impossible to properly assess the potential impacts of mining - including disturbance of seafloor ecosystems; sediment displacement; and noise, vibration, and light pollution - and to establish adequate safeguards. Deepsea mining could worsen the global climate emergency, reducing the ocean\u2019s ability to store carbon by disrupting seafloor sediments.\n\nThe Pacific has been seen as a region of immense deepsea mining potential, but some government leaders are now counselling against the rush to embrace seabed mining.\n\nScientists fear impact of deep-sea mining on search for new medicines Read more\n\n\u201cI ask you all to\u2026 support a 10-year moratorium on seabed mining from 2020 to 2030 which would allow for a decade of proper scientific research of our economic zone and territorial waters,\u201d Fiji president Frank Bainimarama told a climate \u2018sautalaga\u2019 \u2013 an open discussion \u2013 at the Pacific Islands Forum last month.\n\nCharlot Salwai, Prime Minister of Vanuatu, supported Fiji\u2019s call for a 10-year moratorium. Civil society organisations have consistently called for a moratorium on seabed mining \u201cto prioritise the health of our communities and recognise values beyond economic gain\u201d.\n\nPNG had previously been one of deepsea mining\u2019s firmest backers, but new prime minister James Marape has said he is wary of the technology, saying PNG had been \u201cburned\u201d by industry promises.\n\n\u201cUntil that deep sea mining technology is environmentally sound and takes care of our environment at the same time we mine it, that, at this point in time, I support the call made by the Fijian prime minister,\u201d he told the Post Courier.\n\n\u201cIf there is an opportunity for deep-sea mining, so long as environmentally it is friendly and the harvest of resources is done in a sustainable manner then we can give considerations to this, but right now it is a show.\n\n\u201cThe technology is not proven anywhere and PNG, we burnt almost 300 million Kina in that Nautilus [Solwara 1] project on a concept that someone told us can work, but is\u2026 a total failure.\u201d\n\nScientists fear impact of deep-sea mining on search for new medicines Read more\n\nJonathan Mesalum from the Alliance of Solwara Warriors, a community group which opposed the Solwara project, said a 10-year moratorium would be welcomed, \u201cbut we need to go further to protect our seas, our livelihoods and traditions by imposing a ban\u201d.\n\nHe said while Nautilus\u2019s project had collapsed, other companies might take control of the project\u2019s licences and attempt to resurrect it.\n\n\u201cNo one knows about the environmental impact: not scientists, not Nautilus, not the government, nor you or I,\u201d Mesalum told The Guardian. \u201cOur biggest fear is there might be interest from other mining companies who wish to continue the project.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Underwater mining vehicles used off the PNG coast for taking rock samples. Photograph: Nautilus minerals\n\nNautilus developed and successfully tested three undersea robots designed to mine hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, but funding for its production support vessel dried up midway through construction. Under a restructuring plan approved by a Canadian court, the company will be liquidated and left with no assets. But a PNG government-owned company Eda Kopa is seeking to recoup some of its money, in an ongoing dispute back before court this week.\n\nA new report, Why the Rush?, from the Deep Sea Mining campaign described the Pacific as the \u201cnew wild west\u201d for speculative mining ventures, and argued Pacific regional decision-making and political processes have been manipulated by mining companies seeking to take advantage of inchoate and incomplete regulatory frameworks in the region.\n\nSir Arnold Amet, former chief justice of PNG, was Governor of Madang province and an MP when Solwara 1 was approved. He said he regrets that the then government didn\u2019t adequately scrutinise the proposal.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s recognise this failed investment in the upcoming budget and ensure we don\u2019t enter into seabed mining joint ventures in the future or issue any more seabed exploration or mining licences. We now know how deep sea mining companies attempt to manipulate governments according to their own narrow profit motives without any conscience. We look to PM Marape to stand up for Papua New Guineans against the pressure exerted by these corporations.\u201d\n\nThe Environmental Defenders Office NSW said deep seabed mining was similar to open cut mining at depths of between hundreds and thousands of metres below the sea\u2019s surface.\n\n\u201cA 10-year moratorium on deepsea mining is an appropriate application of the precautionary principle in circumstances where the consequences and need for this type of mineral exploitation is not well understood,\u201d the EDO\u2019s BJ Kim told The Guardian.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not only the risks that are not well understood, it\u2019s also clear that appropriate legal frameworks for mining of this kind are not in place, either in the Pacific or elsewhere. This type of commercial experiment in the ocean should not progress without effective regulatory measures for risk mitigation, monitoring and enforcement of conditions.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A robotic arm taking a sample from an underwater rock feature. Photograph: Nautilus minerals\n\nCommunities bordering the Solwara 1 project have been concerned about a broad range of environmental impacts, Kim said, including minerals leaching into seawater affecting fisheries and livelihoods, the extinguishment of unique sea species, and the risk of accidents and spillages.\n\n\u201cCommunities are still living with the impacts of land-based mining disasters such as Ok Tedi and Panguna. Just this year in the Pacific, we\u2019ve seen oil and ore spills in Solomon Islands and the spillage of an estimated 200,000 litres of toxic red slurry from the Ramu Nickel mine in Madang, PNG.\u201d\n\nBesides PNG, the tiny island nation of Nauru has been deep sea mining\u2019s strongest supporter.\n\nStart-up DeepGreen is seeking to extract cobalt and other metals from a 75,000 sq km zone in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the Pacific, over which exclusive control has been granted to Nauru. DeepGreen has secured $150m in funding, the bulk from Swiss-based Allseas, to begin feasibility studies.\n\nNauru is a country already scarred by mining. More than 80% of the tiny island\u2019s landmass has been rendered uninhabitable by phosphate mining during the 20thC, most by colonial powers the UK and Australia.\n\n", "description": "Papua New Guinea out of pocket $157m from failed attempt at mining material from deep-sea vents as opponents point to environmental risk", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84a13ac6d3a418e3b63a8727575b2a7c1a602324/0_153_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f6d92a52fc8c64696ea66d5b019eb483", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
