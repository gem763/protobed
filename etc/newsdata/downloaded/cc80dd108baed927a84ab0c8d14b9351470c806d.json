Financial markets expect at least another reduction from the Reserve Bank, but not until February 2020, and the possibility of unconventional monetary stimulus is now being discussed.\n\n\"Unfortunately, many of these unintended consequences have come to pass, including slowing economic growth, increased borrowing among consumers and companies, and rising competition among businesses as inefficient companies remain afloat longer than they might have without the lifeline of cheap debt \u2013 forcing solid, established businesses to retrench workers or take other cost-cutting measures in order to compete,\" the fund managers wrote on Tuesday.\n\nThey asked the governor in 2016, when the cash rate was 1.5 per cent, to consider that low rates were a form of punishment for retirees and rewarded reckless risk-taking.", "description": "\"If low interest rates and ease of borrowing were the foundation of strong growth, surely Japan and Europe would now be growing very strongly,\" Investors Mutual says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8306%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_208%2C$y_47/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cb130c6674e19fa23bca0a0bd4f80cb265d55702", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
