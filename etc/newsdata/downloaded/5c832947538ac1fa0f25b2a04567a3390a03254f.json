A Syrian opposition source said Russian and Syrian jets are carrying out strikes on the highway that link Heish and Khan Sheikhoun in an apparent attempt to keep the convoy from advancing.\n\nThe Syrian government on Monday accused Turkey of heading to Khan Sheikhoun in order to \"rescue the defeated Al Nusra Front terror group,\" Syrian state media SANA reported, citing a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official.\n\nThe international community has frequently accused the Syrian government of indiscriminate bombing in its fight against rebels since the start of the country's civil war. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are believed to have died in government offensives.", "description": "Turkey's Defense Ministry has condemned an airstrike in northwestern Syria that killed three civilians and injured 12 others on Monday.", "authors": ["Kareem Khadder", "Gul Tuysuz", "Nada Altaher", "Nathan Hodge"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190819165754-idlib-turkey-military-convoy-super-tease.jpg"}
