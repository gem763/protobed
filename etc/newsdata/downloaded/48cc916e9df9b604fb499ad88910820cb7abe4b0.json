There, his picture of the queue at the top of the summit gained worldwide attention.\n\nDuring his climbs, he rescued four other climbers - three of which he called \"suicide missions\" - and has, in his own words, \"bled from every angle\".\n\nBut it wasn't non-stop work. In August, he told the BBC's Colin Murray he climbed Everest, Lhotse and Makalu in five days, but it could have been three - had he not stopped for two nights \"to have a drink\".\n\nIn September, his challenge was held up while he waited for permission to climb the final mountain, Shishapangma, in the Tibetan autonomous region of China.\n\nHis permit was granted on 15 October after the Nepali approached the Chinese government on his behalf.\n\nIn order, the 14 mountains were:\n\nAnnapurna, Nepal, summit reached 23 April\n\nDhaulagiri, Nepal, 12 May\n\nKanchenjunga, Nepal, 15 May\n\nEverest, Nepal, 22 May\n\nLhotse, Nepal, 22 May\n\nMakalu, Nepal, 24 May\n\nNanga Parbat, Pakistan, 3 July\n\nG1, Pakistan, 15 July\n\nG2, Pakistan, 18 July\n\nK2, Pakistan, 24 July\n\nBroad Peak, Pakistan, 26 July\n\nCho Oyu, China, 23 September\n\nShishapangma, China, 29 October", "description": "Nepal's Nirmal Purja, who served in the British Army, completed the challenge in only seven months.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12C18/production/_109442867_e3c176fb-9901-4bac-9f29-8eda40020a6d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
