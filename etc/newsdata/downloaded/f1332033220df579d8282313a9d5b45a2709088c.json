Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, usually a strong Trump supporter, called the decision \"shortsighted and irresponsible.\" Fellow Republican Sen. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a member of the House GOP leadership, called it was \"a catastrophic mistake.\"\n\nGraham and Democratic Sen.Chris Coons sent a letter to McConnell Tuesday requesting a briefing \"as soon as possible\" from the State Department, Pentagon and the intelligence community.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s decision will have severe consequences for our strategic national interests and reduce American influence in the region while strengthening Turkey, Russia, and Iran,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that this was an abrupt decision taken in the face of reported opposition from military and diplomatic advisers, and that thousands of hardened ISIS fighters and thousands more ISIS supporters currently in detention may become free to fight again as their Kurdish captors turn to defending themselves against a Turkish incursion,\u201d they said.\n\nPHOTO: President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with senior military leaders including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army General Mark A.
