Everyone wants to be loved.'\n\nOver a two week period 'Harry' convinced Sally to send him almost \u00a38,000 via Western Union which he claimed was for an operation and to replace a stolen passport and wallet.\n\nHe also told her to keep their online relationship a secret and avoided meeting her in person.\n\nSally lied to her family when they realised something was wrong until she made the devastating discovery 'Harry' was actually a fraudster living in Africa.\n\nAll her bank details, direct debits and phone numbers had to be changed and she stopped all contact with him.\n\nShe said: 'I look back and think how stupid I was. They put it down to me still grieving.\n\nOver a two week period 'Harry', who she never met, convinced Sally to send him almost \u00a38,000 via Western Union which he claimed was for an operation and to replace a stolen passport and wallet.
