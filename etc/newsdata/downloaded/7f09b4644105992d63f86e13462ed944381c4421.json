It\u2019s infectiously insistent.\n\nTchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-BLAM-tchk!\n\nTchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-BLAM-tchk!\n\nThe twist, when it comes in the fifth chord, is just as simple. This time, that crescendo hits twice, on the seventh and eighth.\n\nTchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-BLAM-BLAM!\n\nWith their song Just What I Needed, The Cars had come up with one of the greatest rock intros of all time, using the kind of basic, bare bones guitar skills you could might pick up in your first few guitar lessons. It is a masterclass of tension and release \u2013 the bass and drums sliding in as singer Ben Orr offers one of the most resigned opening lines ever to grace a hit song: \u201cI don\u2019t mind you coming round/and wasting all my time.\u201d\n\nJust when you think the chorus is about to explode, you\u2019re suddenly connecting with a pre-chorus, lit with mournful keyboard. When the chorus finally does come, its impact \u2013 a furious guitar lick, backing vocals stacked seamlessly on top of each other in glittering harmony \u2013 is all the more overwhelming.\n\nThat the song doesn\u2019t begin proceedings on the band\u2019s self-titled 1978 debut isn\u2019t so much an indictment of their ability to sequence an album as proof just how intimidatingly good the rest of their album is. In fact, The Cars\u2019 debut is so chock-full of hits that a song most pop-rock bands would kill for doesn\u2019t come into view until a third of the way through. \"We used to joke that the first album should be called The Cars Greatest Hits,\u201d guitarist Elliot Easton later said in the band\u2019s compilation Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology.\n\nLong road to success\n\nThe band\u2019s sound \u2013 which fused power pop, new wave and classic rock \u2013 managed to sound both like pop music of the past and pop music of the future, and immediately won them a huge following. But what seemed like an overnight success was more than 10 years and several bands in the making.\n\nThe Cars were no bunch of bratty teens. Frontman Ric Ocasek was 33 by the time the band recorded their debut. He\u2019d met bassist Benjamin Orr in Ohio in the mid-1960s when both were playing for local bands. The friendship endured though a career booking bands together in the mid-west before the duo moved to Boston in the early 1970s.\n\nThe band\u2019s sound \u2013 which fused pop, new wave and classic rock \u2013 managed to sound both like pop music of the past and pop music of the future.\n\nThe Cars were not the pair\u2019s first stab at success. In 1973, they released a folk-rock album under the name Milkwood (along with guitarist Jas Goodkind). It failed to chart. Their follow-up band Richard and the Rabbits was also a flash in the pan, but it did introduce them to Greg Hawke, who would bring the trademark synthesizer sting to The Cars power-pop songs.\n\nWhen Ocasek and Orr began playing together as an acoustic duo at a Cambridge coffee house, some of the first Cars songs started to take shape. Another short-lived band rose and fell \u2013 Cap\u2019n Swing. Berklee Music School-educated Elliott Easton, would become one of the foundations of The Cars. The final piece was David Robinson, the drummer with local legends The Modern Lovers, most famous for their driving anthem Roadrunner.\n\nBy this stage, Orr and Ocasek had written and written and written. They had road-tested songs enough to record demos that were played on Boston local radio. Two of the demo tracks \u2013 Just What I Needed and My Best Friend\u2019s Girl\u2013 are amongst the first three tracks on the debut album.\n\nThat Boston airplay led to interest from record companies, keen to sign bands cresting the New Wave. The Cars finally signed with Elektra, at the time the home of folk artist Jackson Browne and The Eagles, whose songs ruled US radio. The band decamped to London to record their album with producer Roy Thomas Baker, who had produced Queen during their rise to success.\n\n\u201cWith The Cars, you had this band with a sparse rhythm section and a unique singer in Ric Ocasek, but when the harmonies kicked in, it was a wall of sound,\u201d Baker told Mix magazine in 1999. \u201cThey came at a time when rock radio really needed some freshening up.\u201d\n\nBaker maker\n\nThe Cars album opens with Good Times Roll. The guitar is buzzing and abrasive, Ocasek\u2019s voice lost in the ether behind it. It sounds sparse and clean. But then comes Baker\u2019s secret weapon.\n\n\u201cWhen the harmony vocals come in, there are as many vocals there as there were in a Queen record,\u201d Baker told Mix magazine. \u201cThe only difference is it was in and then it was gone. Good Times Roll is a classic one for that. When they sing those words, it's huge and then it's gone, and everything is back to sparse again. I was able to put big vocals on a sparse, punkish background, sort of inventing post-punk pop.\u201d\n\nBill Janovitz, the frontman of Boston rock band Buffalo Tom and a music writer, was instantly hooked. \u201cThis album came out when I was 12 or 13. It was a perfect time to hear it, and it was everywhere on the radio.\u201d he tells BBC Music.\n\n\u201cI was still in New York, but when I moved to the Boston area a few years later, The Cars were god, dude,\u201d he says. \u201cI know of no one who dare disrespect this record. I honestly think everyone loves it. Everyone I know, anyway. If they don't like it, I don't like them.\u201d\n\nJanovitz believes it\u2019s an unashamedly classic rock record, despite the New Wave synth sheen.\n\n\u201cIt is certainly ushered in the '80s. But it is an analogue-as-hell record,\u201d says Janovitz. \u201cTube (valve) amps, old guitars, big drums, stacked vocals from Roy Thomas Baker, all delivering Suicide-and-Roxy-Music-and-Beats-poetry-informed bubblegum pop.\u201d\n\nDriving legacy\n\nThe Cars would split in 1988, having latterly become an MTV staple thanks to the likes of 1984\u2019s You Might Think and its computer-graphics-heavy video. Ocasek quickly embarked on a solo career, but also became an in-demand producer. He was behind the desk for Weezer\u2019s first two albums in the early 90s, as well as Nada Surf\u2019s 1996 debut and some of No Doubt\u2019s 2000 album Rock Steady.\n\nIn 1999, the Swedish power pop band The Wannadies recorded their album Yeah with Ocasek. Frontman P\u00e4r Wiksten had been aware of The Cars\u2019 music beforehand, but began to delve further into the band\u2019s catalogue once Ocasek had agreed to produce the album.\n\n\"I was able to put big vocals on a sparse, punkish background, sort of inventing post-punk pop\" - Roy Thomas Baker\n\n\u201cWe rehearsed with Ric in London before heading to New York to record. He was obviously recognised in London, but when we got to NYC \u2013 wow!\u201d he tells BBC Music. \u201cPeople honking their horns, shouting from across the street, cheering! The Cars and Ric were/are absolutely enormous in America!\u201d\n\nThe sessions, Wiksten says, had some oddly coincidental similarities with the album that defined The Cars\u2019 career.\n\n\u201cWhen me and [bandmate and wife] Christina were starting to play with harmonies, especially on the title track Yeah, Ric would leave the room. \u2018I never used to interfere when we recorded with Roy Thomas Baker either. You do what wanna do,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cAnd when we had layered the backing vocals a couple of times, Ric\u2019s assistant Haig ran to get Ric: \u2018It sounds like Queen, man!\u2019 Ric said, with a gentle smile: \u2018It does. Well done!\u2019\u201d\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
