NBC has denied the allegations.\n\nFarrow commended his former employer for their Friday night statement.\n\n\"It is new, and NBCUniversal executives deserve praise for it,\" Farrow said, per The Wall Street Journal's Ben Mullin. \"It is significant and it should be a model for other companies.\"\n\nFarrow tweeted praise for Maddow after her segment: \"Credit where due: @maddow independently confirming my reporting that Weinstein story was halted by NBC execs and calling her bosses to account on their own air \u2014 not an easy thing, for her or her staff \u2014 did this.\"\n\nThe announcement also comes in the wake of former television host Megyn Kelly, who used to work for both NBC and Fox News, demanding that NBC release employees from their NDAs, namely accusers of disgraced anchor Matt Lauer.\n\n\"Show us the money,\" Kelly said during an appearance on Fox News. \"The number one thing that needs to happen now is they need to release any and all Matt Lauer accusers from their confidentiality agreements. NBC says it has nothing to hide. Great. Let's not hide anything.\"", "description": "NBC said there is nothing in any non-disparagement agreements that can legally prevent an employee from disclosing sexual harassment, MSNBC reported.", "authors": ["Lauren Frias"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9deb97e94e862f400cdb87?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
