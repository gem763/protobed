Reviewers have described his performance as the titular character - a mentally unhinged outcast who unwittingly finds fame through an act of violence - being brilliant but terrifying.\n\nThe DC Comics character is associated with a 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a screening of a different Batman film, 'The Dark Knight Rises.' Families of some of the victims expressed concern about the new film and it will not be shown in the Aurora multiplex.\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and armed with assault rifles stood outside a screening of Joker at the New York Film Festival on Wednesday night, where audiences had their bags searched and K9 officers were on duty, video footage showed.\n\nPolice in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago said in statements that while they had no specific threats, they were deploying additional officers or closely monitoring movie theaters where the Joker is playing.\n\nCostumes and face masks have been banned for moviegoers at two US theater chains - AMC and Landmark - while the Alamo Drafthouse cinema group warned parents not to bring their children.\n\nMovie studio Warner Bros. said last week that the film was not an endorsement of real-world violence.\n\n'It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero,' Warner Bros. said in a statement.\n\nDespite the controversy, the movie is expected to take in a bumper $80million or more on its opening weekend in North America, according to box-office analysts.\n\nOn Friday, it was revealed that the movie landed an October box office record, earning $13.3million from its Thursday night showings alone, according to studio Warner Bros.\n\nJoker unseated Venom, which also holds the record for best October opening with $80.3million, according to Comscore.\n\nJoker director Todd Phillips criticized people who have attacked the film without seeing it.\n\nJoker stars Joaquin Phoenix (pictured) as the titular character, a mentally unhinged outcast who unwittingly finds fame through an act of violence\n\n'I didn't imagine the level of discourse that it's reached in the world, honestly,' Variety reported him as saying at the New York Film Festival on Wednesday.\n\n'I think it's OK that it sparks conversations and there are debates around it. The film is the statement and it's great to talk about it, but it's much more helpful if you've seen it.'\n\nPhillips was also quoted as saying: 'Isn't it a good thing to take away the cartoon element about violence that we've become so immune to? I was a little surprised when it turns into that direction, that it's irresponsible.\n\n'Because, to me, it's very responsible to make it feel real and make it have weight and implications.'\n\nDespite receiving critical acclaim, social media monitoring FBI agents in the US have warned it could inspire screening attacks from incels - a term which refers to men who are 'involuntarily celibate' and blame their situation on women.", "description": "Police provided a uniformed presence at the Century Huntington Beach and XD theater in Huntington Beach, California tied to a 'credible' threat associated with the Joker premiere.", "authors": ["Maxine Shen", "Justin Enriquez", "Tracey Wright For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/23/19317296-0-image-a-2_1570226945913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
