Flores says he won't seek reelection\n\nTexas Rep. Bill Flores will not seek reelection in 2020, becoming the latest Republican to retire from the increasingly competitive state.\n\nFlores, who rode the 2010 tea party wave to Congress, serves on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee and is a former chairman of the Republican Study Committee.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWhen I originally announced that I was running for Congress in 2009, I was firm in my commitment that I would run for six or fewer terms,\u201d Flores, 65, announced in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cAfter much prayer over the past few days and following conversations with my wife, Gina, during that time, I have decided that my current term will be my last.\u201d\n\nHis solidly Republican district includes Waco and the northern Austin suburbs and is home to two major universities: Texas A&M and Baylor. While Flores beat his Democratic opponent by 15 percentage points last year, changing demographics in the state \u2014 and especially in the suburbs \u2014 have made a number of races in Texas more competitive.\n\nFlores joins a growing list of Texas Republicans who have decided to head for the exits instead of duking it out for another term. GOP Reps. Will Hurd, Pete Olson and Kenny Marchant, who were facing some of the toughest reelection battles in the state, have all called it quits.\n\nAnd veteran Rep. Mike Conaway, who is term-limited in leading Republicans on the House Agriculture Committee, announced his retirement earlier this summer. While he represents a ruby-red district in central Texas and could have easily won reelection, Republicans \u2014 who have been relegated to the minority for the first time in eight years \u2014 likely face an uphill climb in winning back the House.\n\nMore GOP lawmakers could announce their retirements after the August recess, during which members have spent the past few weeks at home with their families and constituents.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sees Texas as especially ripe for pickups. The DCCC opened an office in Austin in April and put six Republicans in the state on its 2020 target list, though Flores is not one of them.\n\nFlores said he intends to spend more time with his family and \u201cresume business activities in the private sector\u201d after he leaves Congress. Prior to being elected to the House, Flores worked for a top accounting firm and spent 30 years in the oil and gas business, including serving as president and CEO of Phoenix Exploration Co.", "description": "His solidly Republican district includes Waco and the northern Austin suburbs and is home to two major universities.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7a/3f/8e760f56452f8c4bb564e998dddf/190904-bill-flores-ap-773.jpg"}
