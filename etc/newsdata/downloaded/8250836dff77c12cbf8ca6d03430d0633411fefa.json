Elizabeth Warren, D-N.H., said most Americans are \u201ctired of the ugliness... tired of the name-calling... tired of the disgusting behavior\u201d coming from the Republican president.\n\nAnd, speaking with reporters after a town hall in New Hampshire, the state holding the first primary in the race for the White House, the Democrat from neighboring Massachusetts spotlighted Tuesday\u2019s impeachment inquiry testimony by Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, arguing it\u2019s further proof that the president violated the law in asking a foreign country to investigate one of Trump\u2019s top 2020 rivals.\n\nVindman, the National Security Council's (NSC) Director of European Affairs, said he listened to a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He became the first current White House official to testify in the probe led by House Democrats. According to his prepared remarks, he was concerned by what he heard on the phone call and alerted the NSC\u2019s chief counsel.\n\nHOUSE DEMOCRATS INTRODUCE RESOLUTION FORMALIZING IMPEACHMENT INQUIRE PROCEDURES\n\nThe president has come under fire over the conversation, in which he asked Zelensky to look into the dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Recent polls have shown Biden and Warren at the front of the pack among the Democrats aiming to challenge Trump in next year\u2019s election. Fueled by whistleblower complaints, a transcript of the call released by the White House and witness testimony, Democrats have argued the president was asking a foreign country to try interfering in a U.S. election.\n\nAdding to the controversy was the fact that before that phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was put on hold. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, Trump repeatedly has insisted that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d and has on numerous occasions described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nVINDMAN TELLS LAWMAKERS HE WAS NOT WHISTLEBLOWER\n\nAhead of Tuesday\u2019s appearance by Vindman, Trump questioned the officer\u2019s credibility as a witness and labeled him \u2013 without offering proof \u2013 as a \u201cnever Trumper.\u201d\n\nAsked about the president\u2019s criticism of the national security official, Warren told reporters, \u201cthis is one more example of Donald Trump trying to distract from the substance of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nShe emphasized, \u201cWe\u2019ve now heard from one more person who was on the call who understands clearly that Donald Trump pressured the head of the government of Ukraine in order to protect Donald Trump\u2019s own political future. That is a violation of the law and it is also morally wrong. Trump hopes we\u2019ll talk about something other than that. He\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nIf the House were to impeach the president, the action would move then to the Senate, which would hold a trial. That could occur as soon as early next year, in the weeks ahead of the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire\u2019s primary.\n\nAsked how she could balance her role on an impeachment trial and campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire, Warren told reporters, \u201cSome things are more important than politics. I took a pledge to uphold the Constitution of the United States and that\u2019s what this impeachment is all about. Donald Trump thinks he\u2019s above the law. The Constitution says otherwise.\u201d\n\nTrump and Warren have long sparred, dating back to her time during the 2016 election as a top surrogate for Democrat Hillary Clinton. The president repeatedly has mocked Warren as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d over her controversial claims of Native American heritage.\n\nAsked by an audience member during the town hall how she would push back against Trump if she won the nomination, the senator pledged, \u201cYou don\u2019t back down from a bully.\u201d\n\nShe also previewed, \u201cI think the way we do this is, we show aggressively what we can do, the kind of country we can be. We give Americans a real choice.\u201d\n\nWarren also emphasized, \u201cthe Donald Trump show... it\u2019s just getting old and it\u2019s getting boring.\u201d\n\nSANDERS, WARREN TOP NEW NH POLL, BIDEN SLIPS TO THIRD\n\nWarren held her town hall in a gym in Laconia\u2019s middle school, which was also the site of a Trump general-election rally in September 2016.\n\nThe senator arrived in Laconia hours after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview he\u2019s open to loosening financial crisis-era liquidity requirements for big banks to relieve potential cash crunches in short-term funding markets.\n\nMNUCHIN OPEN TO LOOSER BANK LIQUIDITY RULES\n\nWarren, who sits on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and who has long crusaded against Wall Street and the big banks, took aim at the treasury secretary.\n\n\u201cWhat Steven Mnuchin proposes is dangerous and it\u2019s in the exact direction that every single step taken by the Trump administration has gone, and that is making it a little easier for the banks to make a little more money with a little less oversight,\u201d she argued. \u201cIn 2008, that kind of thinking brought our entire country to the brink of financial collapse. What these guys are doing is short-term profits for the banks and long-term pain for the American people.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Republican National Committee, ahead of Warren's visit just two days before Halloween, said: \u201cHer plans are terrifying.\u201d\n\nRNC Spokeswoman Nina McLaughlin added, \u201cGranite Staters have seen the positive changes made under President Trump\u2019s administration and will choose to keep America strong and prosperous, rather than take a gamble on Warren\u2019s progressive pipe dreams.\u201d", "description": "Using some of her strongest language yet against President Trump, Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
