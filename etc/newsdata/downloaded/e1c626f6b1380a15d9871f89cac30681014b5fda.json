Others either don\u2019t consider it a formal impeachment investigation or believe the committee is just starting to craft one.\n\nEven senior members of leadership have offered mixed messages on the investigation.\n\nReps. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the judiciary committee, and Jim Jordan said the latest impeachment push is a desperate play for Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe reason want to do this \u2026 the reason they want to change the rules is because nothing else has worked for them,\u201d Mr. Jordan said.\n\nMr. McCarthy is confident that the Democrat\u2019s work on investigating President Trump will be a boon for GOP House candidates in 2020.\n\nHe pointed out that Republicans only need to flip 19 seats to retake the majority \u2014 less than Democrats needed going into the 2018 election \u2014 and there are 31 Democrats in vulnerable districts the president carried in 2016.\n\n\u201cTell me, how are Democrats going to go back and ask for reelection on what they have achieved?\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. \u201cAll they have achieved is investigations that have gone nowhere.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
