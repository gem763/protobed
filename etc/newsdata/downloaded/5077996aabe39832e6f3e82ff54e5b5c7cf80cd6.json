Nasser Sultan's legacy as a reality star will now last forever, thanks to a permanent tattoo he had inked across his chest in Bali on Tuesday\n\nThe blue tick is a reference to the symbol used by Instagram to show that a person's account has been verified by the site's administrators.\n\nThe verification system allows high-profile users, including celebrities and politicians, to show that their account is genuine.\n\nFor months, Nasser had battled with the social media giant for blue tick verification, before eventually being granted it in August.\n\nThat's clever! Nasser, 52, had the word 'celebrity' tattooed on his chest alongside a blue tick\n\nNasser revealed he got the tattoo because he is 'Australia's biggest celebrity' and he wants people to know.\n\nIn footage obtained by Daily Mail Australia, Nasser can be heard telling the tattoo artist what design he wants and explaining how famous he is back home.\n\n'You know who I am, don't you?' he asks, as the man shaves his chest area.\n\nThat makes sense! Nasser revealed he got the tattoo because he is 'Australia's biggest celebrity' and he wants people to know\n\nExcellent work! After getting his tattoo, Nasser posed with the artists in their Kuta studio\n\n'Big celebrity from Australia and best in Bali!' the tattoo artist responds, looking rather confused.\n\nNasser rose to fame on season four of Married At First Sight in early 2018, before later appearing as a plaintiff on Channel 10's Trial by Kyle.\n\nHe has also filmed an episode of First Dates, which will air on Seven next year.\n\nRemember them? Nasser rose to fame on season four of Married At First Sight in early 2018.
