It doesn\u2019t have to prove its ability to come together. It doesn\u2019t have to prove that it won\u2019t allow things like that to stop people going around, living a good life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shopping centre \u2013 yesterday it was closed, today it\u2019s open and it\u2019s full of shoppers. That\u2019s the way Manchester will continue to respond if we do have a similar incident of this sort.\u201d\n\nMr Burnham said the incident had highlighted again the debate on knife crime, but he pointed out there had been a \u201csignificant\u201d fall in such offences in Greater Manchester over the summer.\n\nEmergency services have been praised for their response to the incident (PA)\n\nHe said: \u201cThat was in part due to more targeted use of stop-and-search powers. So one thing I will be asking the chief constable to consider is more use of stop-and-search powers, but of course in a way that is intelligence-led, non-discriminatory, and in partnership with both our local authorities and community organisations.\u201d\n\nA 59-year-old man received stab wounds to his hand and palm and a 19-year-old woman sustained wounds to her arm and armpit \u2013 which required surgery \u2013 during the incident on Friday.\n\nAnother 19-year-old woman suffered a cut to her elbow, a 33-year-old woman received a cut to her stomach and a 43-year-old woman was assessed by medics but appeared uninjured.\n\nThe shopping centre is just a few hundred yards from Manchester Arena, where 22 people were killed in May 2017 when Salman Abedi detonated a suicide bomb following an Ariana Grande concert.\n\nIn the city last New Year\u2019s Eve, three people including a police officer were seriously injured when a 25-year-old man launched a knife attack on passers-by.\n\nHe was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and will face trial in November.", "description": "Two people suffered stab wounds in the incident on Friday morning.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/16/wire-19629410-1570893527-683_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
