This is because all the noise- and air pollution can take a toll on animals and leave them scared and stressed. However, over the years, people have come to realise that Diwali is one of the worst times for our four-legged friends and are making efforts to have an animal and pet-friendly Diwali. If you too wish to have a pet-friendly Diwali this year, here are some tips you should keep in mind.Crackers not just add to air pollution but also contribute the most to the noise pollution during Diwali. The loud noise produced when these crackers burst are enough to scare your pet. Most pets run away and hide in - corners on hearing the loud sounds. While you can only hope that others are sensitive enough to animals, you can do your share by not bursting crackers this Diwali. If you really must, opt for the ones that are low on the noise factor, and instead are a display of lights.Pets are likely to crouch under the bed or hide behind the door after hearing loud noises during Diwali. Instead of trying to get them out to pet them, let them be on their own for some time. After the initial reaction, they will adjust accordingly and when they feel safe, they will come out on their own. If however, you are too worried, you can sit in the same room and wait for them to come out.If you have pets in the house, avoid playing loud music at your Diwali party. This is because it will only add to the loud sounds from crackers outside, thus increasing the noise levels. While you may enjoy dancing to those peppy numbers, it will just stress out your pet even more. If you simply cannot do without music, shut the door of the room where your pet is and maintain a moderate music volume.One way to minimize the noise levels is to keep the doors and windows of your house shut. This will also prevent the polluted air from entering in to an extent and make breathing a little easier. Your pets will also feel safer and relaxed. If they are still too scared, shut the drapes as well.In order to shield them further from the noise, you can check online or with your local vet about the availability of ear muffs for pets. Since Diwali is just around the corner, chances are, you will find something for them. These will help cancel out the noise to an extent. You can also buy mouth guards if you are worried that your pet may accidentally nibble on the fireworks lying in the house.", "description": "How to have a pet-friendly Diwali: These tips will help your pet be less stressed and anxious this Diwali.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2017/oct/alia_sm_1508309648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
