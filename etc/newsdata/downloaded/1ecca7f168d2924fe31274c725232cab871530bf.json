It was a very difficult time in South Africa, so to be a little girl and push yourself in this type of dancing, where there are no other black girls, was really tough,\u2019 she explained.\n\nOti has been wowing viewers with her partner Kelvin Fletcher (Picture: BBC)\n\nThe 38-year-old added to The Mirror: \u2018And when we did get the chance to learn the waltz and the cha cha cha, at a weekend club, we were soon better than the teacher.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefinitely not hard to believe.\n\nThe sisters, who are going up against each other at the NTAs next year, first discovered their passion for dancing when they saw a couples\u2019 ballroom competition while they were on holiday in Durban, before begging their mother to let them learn.\n\nMotsi added that their parents made \u2018a lot of sacrifices\u2019 due to dancing being an expensive sport.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so thankful for dance because if I had grown up with just the bitterness of the very hard childhood we had, and I\u2019d never experienced the love of the dance world, then I probably would have been a very sad person,\u2019 she explained.\n\nMotsi has quickly become a beloved member of the judging panel (Picture: BBC One)\n\nWhile Oti has been part of the Strictly family since 2015, wowing fans with her choreography, Motsi joined the judging panel this year.\n\nHowever, it hasn\u2019t been a smooth journey, as she faced backlash about working with her sister.\n\n\u2018Once you\u2019ve been in the public eye, you are always going to be criticised,\u2019 she told Good Housekeeping.\n\n\u2018Strictly is the master of all dance programmes.
