Over the past 10 years, we estimate that while the D.C. metro as a whole has added enough new housing to keep pace with job growth, D.C. proper has had a slight undersupply of new construction.\u201d\n\nThe median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the region is $1,577, above the national average of $1,189. Rent increases are occurring throughout the D.C. metro area. According to Apartment List, rents have risen in the largest 10 cities within the region.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe high demand for housing in D.C. has made it one of the nation\u2019s more expensive markets,\u201d wrote Salviati. \u201cAmong the same set of large cities referenced above, D.C. ranks as the 12th most expensive.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCities that rank more expensive than the District include San Francisco; San Jose; New York; Anaheim, Calif.; Boston; San Diego; Santa Ana, Calif; Long Beach, Calif; Los Angeles; Seattle; and Aurora, Colo.\n\nCities where rents are rising faster than the national average include Mesa, Ariz; Henderson, Nev.; Las Vegas; Phoenix; Raleigh, N.C.; Austin; Greensboro, N.C.; Nashville; Colorado Springs; and Charlotte.\n\nFor the full report on rents nationwide, click here.\n\nFor the report on Washington, D.C., click here.\n\nAD", "description": "TOWN SQUARE | The high demand for housing in the region has made it one of the nation\u2019s more expensive markets in the United States, according to Apartment List.", "authors": ["Michele Lerner"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TMqdg-T1BSnmhZEl4FXsAtNf_QU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E32RJESXZUI6TEJW7DTDN4PW34.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
