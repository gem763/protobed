But for a tiny handful of people, those memories touch American presidential history. Shortly after the attacks began, the most powerful man in the world, who had been informed of the World Trade Center explosions in a Florida classroom, was escorted to a runway and sent to the safest place his handlers could think of: the open sky.\n\nFor the next eight hours, with American airspace completely cleared of jets, a single blue-and-white Boeing 747, tail number 29000\u2014filled with about 65 passengers, crew and press, and the 43rd president, George W. Bush, as well as 70 box lunches and 25 pounds of bananas\u2014traversed the eastern United States. On board, President Bush and his aides argued about two competing interests\u2014the need to return to Washington and reassure a nation and the competing need to protect the commander in chief. All the while, he and his staff grappled with the aftermath of the worst attack on American soil in their lifetimes, making crucial decisions with only flickering information about the attacks unfolding below. Bush struggled even to contact his family and to reach Vice President Dick Cheney in the White House bunker.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe story of those remarkable hours\u2014and the thoughts and emotions of those aboard\u2014isolated eight miles above America, escorted by three F-16 fighters, flying just below the speed of sound, has never been comprehensively told.\n\nThis oral history, based on more than 40 hours of original interviews with more than two dozen of the passengers, crew and press aboard\u2014including many who have never spoken publicly about what they witnessed that day\u2014traces the story of how an untested president, a sidearm-carrying general, top aides, the Secret Service and the Cipro-wielding White House physician, as well as five reporters, four radio operators, three pilots, two congressmen and a stenographer responded to 9/11.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrologue\n\nAndy Card, chief of staff, White House: We woke up in Sarasota, Florida, at the Colony Resort. There was a terrible stench in the air\u2014the red tide had killed a lot of fish that had washed up on the shore. I remember being struck by that smell coming from Air Force One the night before. We\u2019d gone off to dinner in Tampa. It was unusual for President Bush to stay out late like that, but it was a relaxing evening.\n\nAri Fleischer, press secretary, White House: The day couldn\u2019t have begun any better or more beautifully.\n\nGordon Johndroe, assistant press secretary, White House: The day starts off very normally\u2014the president went for a run, and I took the [press] pool out with the president. I remember I got stung by a bee, and I asked Dr. Tubb if he had something he could give me for the swelling. He said, \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll get you something when we get to the airplane.\u201d Needless to say, I promptly forgot about it that day.\n\nSonya Ross, reporter, Associated Press: This was a garden variety trip. It was low-ranking staff and a lot of the top journalists didn\u2019t come. It was a scrub trip.\n\nMike Morell, presidential briefer, Central Intelligence Agency: I walked into his suite [for the president\u2019s morning intelligence briefing]; he was surrounded by breakfast foods and he hadn\u2019t touched any of it. He asked me if I\u2019d gone to the beach the night before, and I told him I\u2019d just gone right to bed. The second intifada was well underway then, and the briefings at that time were very heavy on Israeli-Palestinian stuff. A good bit of the briefing that morning was about Israeli matters. There was one thing that caught his attention, and he picked up the phone to call Condi [Rice] to ask her to follow up on it. There was nothing in the briefing about terrorism. It was very routine\u2014just him, me, Andy Card and Deb Loewer from the Situation Room.\n\nAndy Card: The president was in a great mood. He had that George W. Bush strut that morning.\n\nB. Alexander \u201cSandy\u201d Kress, senior education adviser, White House: The whole point of the trip was education. He was pushing No Child Left Behind as Congress was coming back to Washington. [Secretary of Education] Rod Paige and I briefed him ahead of his remarks to the press. It was a beautiful day\u2014we were in his suite. He was in a really good mood. We were out of the Oval and he was relaxed. Those were probably the last carefree moments he had in his term.\n\nAndy Card: I remember literally telling him, \u201cIt should be an easy day.\u201d Those were the words. \u201cIt should be an easy day.\u201d\n\n\n\nI. Emma Booker Elementary School, Sarasota, Fla.\n\nAri Fleischer: Back in 2001, no one had iPhones or BlackBerrys. I had this high-tech pager on my belt\u2014it was two-way, in that you could send back one of like 14 preprogrammed responses. For the day, it was pretty fancy-fancy stuff. As we were driving to the first stop for the day, I got a page from Brian Bravo, who put together the White House news clips.\n\nBrian Bravo, press assistant, White House: My job was to just scour the news\u2014TV, the AP wire, Bloomberg. I just spent my time at the desk [in the White House], feeding the news all day to the White House staff. I actually had a buddy in New York who called me. He worked in a tall office tower and had seen the first plane hit. It was word-of-mouth intel, but then I started to see TV starting to cover it. To get to the pagers they used back then on the road, I\u2019d have to parse any story down to a few short words. I just said, \u201cA plane has hit the World Trade Center.\u201d At that point, no one knew what it meant.\n\nAri Fleischer: I got out [of the motorcade] thinking this must\u2019ve been some kind of terrible accident.\n\nBrian Montgomery, director of advance, White House: When the motorcade arrives, I get out and I was running towards the limo\u2014I always run towards the limo\u2014and Mark Rosenker, the head of the White House Military Officer, says to me, \u201cDr. Rice needs to talk to the president.\u201d\n\nAri Fleischer: Karl Rove told [the president] first.\n\nKarl Rove, senior adviser, White House: We were standing outside the elementary school. My phone rang. It was my assistant Susan Ralston, saying that a plane had hit the World Trade Center\u2014it wasn\u2019t clear whether it was private, commercial, prop, or jet. That\u2019s all she had. The boss was about two feet away. He was shaking hands. I told him the same thing. He arched his eyebrows like, \u201cGet more.\u201d\n\nDave Wilkinson, assistant agent-in-charge, U.S. Secret Service: Eddie Marinzel and I were the two lead agents with the president that day. The head of the detail was back in Washington. We heard, \u201cThere\u2019s an incident in New York.\u201d\n\nBrian Montgomery: There was this group of students, all young ladies in uniforms and teachers, all oblivious to all of this. They had no idea what was going on. The president was very gracious and greeted them, and then said, \u201cI need to go take an important telephone call.\u201d He went into the holding room and went directly to the STU-III [the secure telephone].\n\nAri Fleischer: There\u2019s always a secure telephone waiting for the president, but in the nine months he\u2019d been president, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d ever used one before an event like that. Condi was holding for him.\n\nAndy Card: We were standing at the door to the classroom, when a staffer came up and said, simply, \u201cSir, it appears that a twin-engine prop plane crashed into one of the World Trade Center towers.\u201d We all said something like what a tragedy. I remember I was thinking about the passengers\u2014how much they must\u2019ve worried as they realized what was about to happen. It was only a nanosecond, and then the principal opened the door and the president went into the classroom to meet the students.\n\nBrian Montgomery: We\u2019re trying to get a TV for the hold room\u2014all we could find was this massive 30-inch TV on a cart with rabbit ears.\n\nNew Window \u2018The Safest and Most Dangerous Place in the World at the Exact Same Time\u2019: Click to view gallery. | George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\n\nDave Wilkinson: We take everything extremely seriously, anything that could affect the presidency. We began speaking to experts back at the White House. No one knew anything. We\u2019re asking ourselves, \u201cIs there any direction of interest towards the president?\u201d That\u2019s the phrase, \u201cdirection of interest.\u201d Or is this just an attack on New York?\n\nSandy Kress: I was back in the media room. There was some buzz about the first plane, people were watching it on a TV. Then there was a stampede across the media room as they saw the second plane hit.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam (R-Florida): I was brand new. I was a freshman [congressman]. We\u2019d gone into the media center, when the main event was going to be, while we wait for the president and the children to read together in the other room. We were clustered around the TV and watched the second plane hit.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark, superintendent of communications, Air Force One: From all indications, it was going to be a simple trip. I had breakfast with one of the navigators, and we were talking about how we were having breakfast in Florida and we\u2019re going to be back in time for lunch.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman, presidential pilot, Air Force One: We were all getting ready, based on the estimated departure time. All of us had already shown up at the plane.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: There were two TV tuners, worldwide television tuners [at my workspace on Air Force One]. They were like old-school rabbit ears\u2014UHF and VHF frequencies. We didn\u2019t have the ability to tune into CNN, Fox, or anything else. It was the Today Show, the strongest signal that day, and they\u2019re showing pictures [of the Towers], smoke billowing out. I saw the second airplane strike. I said, \u201cOh shit.\u201d I just dropped everything and ran downstairs to get Colonel Tillman: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come see this.\u201d\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: It didn\u2019t make any sense. It\u2019s a clear-and-a-million day.\n\nPresident George W. Bush participates in a reading demonstration the morning of Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2001, at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. | George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\n\nStaff Sgt. William \u201cBuzz\u201d Buzinski, security, Air Force One: Our job is to protect the asset [Air Force One]. The Secret Service is principal protection. We\u2019re asset protection. We protect the plane 24 hours a day, even after the president has left. One of the advance [Secret Service] agents had told us about the first plane. Then about 17 minutes later, I see the same guy sprinting across the tarmac. He said, \u201cAnother plane hit the towers.\u201d I knew instantly it was terrorism. We started to increase security around the plane\u2014made it a tighter bubble.\n\nStaff Sgt. Paul Germain, airborne communications system operator, Air Force One: We thought it was weird even just when the first plane hit. People who know airplanes, that\u2019s some real stuff right there. Big airplanes just don\u2019t hit little buildings. Then, as soon as that second plane hit, that switchboard lit up like a Christmas tree.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: Everything started coming alive. We were hooked into the PEOC [the White House bunker] and the JOC [Joint Operations Center], for the Secret Service. They\u2019re all in the link now.\n\nAndy Card: Another plane hit the other Tower. My mind flashed to three initials: UBL. Usama bin Laden. Then I was thinking that we had White House people there\u2014my deputy, Joe Hagin, and a team were in New York preparing for the U.N. General Assembly. I was thinking that Joe was probably at the World Trade Center, that\u2019s where the Secret Service office was, in the basement.\n\nMike Morell: I was really worried that someone was going to fly a plane into that school. This event had been on schedule for weeks, anyone could have known about it. Eddie [Marinzel, the lead Secret Service agent] wanted to get the hell out of there as fast as possible.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam: There\u2019s some debate within the staff that I can hear about how the president needs to address the nation. They\u2019re saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t do it here. You can\u2019t do it in front of fifth-graders.\u201d The Secret Service is saying, \u201cYou\u2019re doing it here or you\u2019re not doing at all. We\u2019re not taking the time to do it somewhere else. We need to get him secure.\u201d\n\nDave Wilkinson: We\u2019re talking to folks back at the White House, we\u2019re beginning to get the motorcade up and running, getting the motorcycle cops back, we\u2019re ready to evacuate at a moment\u2019s notice. All of a sudden it hits me: The president\u2019s the only one who doesn\u2019t know that this plane has hit the second building. It was a discomfort to all of us that the president didn\u2019t know. The event was dragging on, and that\u2019s when Andy Card came out.\n\nAndy Card: A thousand times a day, a chief of staff has to ask \u201cDoes the president need to know?\u201d This was an easy test to pass. As strange as it sounds, as I was standing there waiting to talk to the president, I was reflecting on another time that I\u2019d had to be the calm one: I\u2019d been acting chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush when he threw up on the Japanese prime minister. I was all business in that moment. He\u2019d refused to get in the ambulance\u2014he didn\u2019t want anyone to see the president get in the ambulance\u2014and in the limo, he\u2019s still sick and he\u2019s getting sick on me. In the hotel, I take out my laminated \u201cin case of emergency\u201d card. I went down my checklist. I was telling people, \u201cHe\u2019s not dying, he\u2019s still the president.\u201d My job that day was to be calm, cool, and collected. Not the same magnitude, of course, but I knew my job on 9/11 was to be calm, cool, and collected.\n\nAt left, George W.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum\n\nKarl Rove: I remember [Andy Card] pausing at the door, before he went in, it seemed like forever, but it was probably just a couple heartbeats. I never understood why, but he told me, years later, that he needed to spend a moment formulating the words he wanted to use.\n\nAndy Card: When I was standing at the classroom door, I knew I was delivering a message that no president would want to hear. I knew that my message would define the moment. I decided to pass on two facts and an editorial comment. I didn\u2019t want to invite a conversation because the president was sitting in front of the classroom. I entered the room and Ann Compton, of ABC, in the press pool, gestured, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I gestured back to her, two planes crashing. She gestured \u201cWhat?\u201d Then the teacher asked the students to take out their books, so I took that opportunity to approach the president. I whispered in his ear, \u201cA second plane hit the second Tower. America is under attack.\u201d I took a couple steps back so he couldn\u2019t ask any questions. The students were completely focused on their books. I remember thinking what a bizarre stage we\u2019re standing on. I was pleased with how the president reacted\u2014he didn\u2019t do anything to create fear.\n\nEllen Eckert, stenographer, White House: There are six stenographers who work for the [White House] press office. One of us always travels with the president. I always said I typed fast for a living all over the world. [That morning] was uneventful until Andy walked in.\n\nAri Fleischer: For Andy to interrupt a presidential event, [we knew] it had to be of monumental consequence. You just didn\u2019t do that.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: Everything started lighting up. We saw Andy Card whisper in the president\u2019s ear. We still didn\u2019t know what the hell was going on. We\u2019re just monitoring the Secret Service and staff radio channels. It was chaos. What\u2019s next? All of a sudden, other reports start coming in\u2014explosion at the White House, car bomb at the State Department. We\u2019re under attack. I was 35 years old. My military career and my perspective is, I\u2019m thinking Cold War, the big bad Soviet bear. This was an extensive attack. Could this be a nation-state?\n\nGordon Johndroe: Having been in that room\u2014and it wasn\u2019t an issue until the Michael Moore documentary [Fahrenheit 9/11]\u2014it would have been odd if he\u2019d jumped up and ran from the room. It didn\u2019t seem like an eternity in the room. He finished the book and went back into the hold room.\n\nKarl Rove: When the president walked back into the staff hold, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re at war\u2014give me the FBI director and the vice president.\u201d\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

Adam Putnam: Matt Kirk, our White House liaison, says to [Rep. Dan Miller (R-Fla.), the other congressman traveling with the presidential party, and me], \u201cWe might be the only plane back to D.C. today.\u201d He tells us that if we want a ride, we need to not have anyone notice us. If anyone notices us, they won\u2019t let us back on board. We need to be inconspicuous quickly, so we went and just got in our vehicle in the motorcade. You could see the windows and hatches of the motorcade open up, the visible expression of the armaments that are always around the president.\n\nKarl Rove: Eddie Marinzel [from the Secret Service] came up to the president, he was sitting in one of those tiny elementary school chairs, and Eddie said, \u201cWe need to get you to Air Force One and get you airborne.\u201d They\u2019d determined this might be an effort to decapitate the government.\n\nDave Wilkinson: We ended up with a compromise\u2014Andy Card said we have a whole auditorium full, waiting for the next event. There was no imminent threat there in Sarasota, so we agreed [the president could give a statement before we left.]\n\nBrian Montgomery: It was the fear of the unknown. We didn\u2019t know if someone had put a biological agent or chemical agent at the school. He went to the auditorium. I remember looking at the students when he said, \u201cAmerica is under attack,\u201d and these girls, their faces were saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s he\u2019s telling us?\u201d\n\nAndy Card: He gave a very brief statement, he started off and I cringed right away. He said, \u201cI\u2019m going back to Washington, D.C.\u201d And I thought, you don\u2019t know that. We don\u2019t know that. We don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going.\n\nGordon Johndroe: I told the press we\u2019d be leaving right for the motorcade. We have this joke, mostly with the photographers\u2014no running. No running to catch the president. This time, I told them, \u201cGuys, we\u2019re going to have to run. We\u2019re going to have to run to the motorcade.\u201d Going down the highway, our 15-passenger van was barely keeping up.\n\nDave Wilkinson: The motorcade left there and in a very aggressive fashion we got to the aircraft. Intelligence information is always sketchy. When we\u2019re riding is the first time that we hear that\u2019s there\u2019s something vague about a threat to the president. That ratcheted things up.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam: On the motorcade back, there are all these protesters\u2014it was still all about the recount\u2014signs like, \u201cShrub stole the election.\u201d\n\nAndy Card: In the limo, we\u2019re both on our cellphones\u2014he\u2019s frustrated because he can\u2019t reach Don Rumsfeld. It was a very fast limo ride. We didn\u2019t know that the Pentagon had just been attacked, so that\u2019s why we couldn\u2019t get Rumsfeld.\n\nDave Wilkinson: We asked for double-motorcade blocks at the intersection. Double and triple blocks. Not just motorcycle officers standing there with their arms up, but vehicles actually blocking the road. Now we\u2019re worried about a car bomb. The whole way back, we were using the limos as a shell game, to keep the president safe. At the airport, we\u2019re no longer worried about the president waving to people. No handshakes, no hugs goodbye, it\u2019s out of the motorcade, up the stairs, we just don\u2019t know what the hell is going on.\n\nMike Morell: When we got back to the plane, it was ringed by security and Secret Service with automatic weapons. I\u2019d never seen anything like that before. They re-searched everyone before we could reboard, not just the press. They searched Andy Card\u2019s briefcase, he was standing right in front of me in line. They went through my briefcase, which was filled with all these classified materials, but I wasn\u2019t going to object that day.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: As the motorcade\u2019s coming in, I\u2019ve got the 3 and 4 engines were already running.\n\nAndy Card: When the limo door opened, I was struck that the engines on Air Force One were running. That\u2019s normally a protocol no-no.\n\nBuzz Buzinski: You never lose the excitement of seeing the motorcade. I\u2019m on the back stairs watching as they pull up. I was wondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s the president thinking? What\u2019s Andy Card thinking? What are they doing to make it happen?\u201d You could feel it. You could feel the tension. We\u2019d been attacked on our soil. You could see it on their face\u2014Andy Card, Ari Fleischer, the president.\n\nSonya Ross: They brought out the bomb-sniffing dogs. They were drooling all [over] the luggage. I had dog spittle all over my bags.\n\nBuzz Buzinski: Everyone other than the president and his senior staff enter through the back stairs, so about 80 percent of the passengers came past us. You could see fear and shock. People couldn\u2019t believe what they had just seen. They didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nSandy Kress: Getting on the plane was different than it ever had been. There was a lot of attention to our credentials, who we were. We had to show ID and our badge, not just the badge. And this even though the crew knew most of us.\n\nEric Draper, presidential photographer, White House: The Secret Service wanted to get him on the plane as quickly as possible. I figured that I\u2019ve got to stick like glue to the president. Obviously, I know it\u2019s going to be a big day. My goal was to find him as quickly as possible on board, but Andy Card said at the top of the stairs, \u201cTake the batteries out of your cellphone. We don\u2019t want to be tracked.\u201d That brought me up. \u201cAre we a target?\u201d I wasn\u2019t thinking of that.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: President Bush comes up the stairs in Sarasota, now you watch him come up the stairs every day, that famous Texas swagger. He was focused that day. No swagger. He was just trucking up the stairs. He was a man on a mission. As soon as the passengers are on board, I fire [engines] 1 and 2.\n\nAndy Card: We\u2019re starting to roll almost before the president gets into the suite.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam: There was one van, maybe a press van, that was parked too close to the plane\u2019s wing. I remember a Secret Service agent running down the aisle; they opened the back stairs, he ran down to move the truck. He never made it back on board. They didn\u2019t wait for him.\n\nGordon Johndroe: We took off and it was something out of [the movie] Independence Day. That thing took off like a rocket. The lamps are shaking they\u2019d fired up the engines so much.\n\nKarl Rove: [Col. Tillman] stood that thing on its tail\u2014just nose up, tail down, like we were on a roller coaster.\n\nEllen Eckert: We were climbing so high and so fast I started to wonder if we\u2019d need oxygen masks.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: It was the uncertainty. As we\u2019re taking off, you\u2019re still getting all this misinformation. Your head was spinning, trying to figure out what had actually happened. The only thing we knew for sure, because we\u2019d seen it with our own eyes, was that the World Trade Center had been hit.\n\nAboard Air Force One, en route to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. Pictured from left are: Andy Card; Ari Fleischer, Press Secretary; Blake Gottesman, Personal Aide to the President; Karl Rove, Senior Adviser; Deborah Loewer, Director of White House Situation Room, and Dan Bartlett, Deputy Assistant to the President. | U.S. National Archives\n\nCol. Dr. Richard Tubb, presidential physician, White House Medical Unit: The people who are the permanent, apolitical staff\u2014the medical unit, the flight crew, the military aide\u2014they were all well-versed in their emergency action plans, irrespective of who the president was, but they\u2014we\u2014didn\u2019t have the relationship yet with the political staff. That trust was still coming. It\u2019s a very different worldview for each side. It\u2019s only time over time that you build those relationships, and there hadn\u2019t been that much time. It\u2019s hard enough for any administration\u2014but that particular transition was so abbreviated and ugly as the 2000 campaign was\u2014it was even harder. Those guys were still trying to put their government together. Everyone was excited because they were just coming back from the summer vacation and felt that they were going to hit their stride.\n\nAndy Card: I really think President Bush\u2014I know President Bush took office on January 20, 2001\u2014but the responsibility of being president became a reality when I whispered in his ear. I honestly believe as he contemplated what I said, I took an oath. Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. It\u2019s not cutting taxes, it\u2019s not No Child Left Behind, it\u2019s not immigration, it\u2019s the oath. When you pick a president, you want to pick a president who can handle the unexpected. This was the unexpected. That\u2019s what the president was wrestling with that day. He recognized the cold reality of his responsibilities.\n\nEric Draper: Soon after we got on board, I see [the president] pop out of the cabin, he\u2019s heading down the aisle. He says, \u201cOK boys, this is what they pay us for.\u201d I\u2019ll never forget that.\n\nAndy Card: Even before we left the school, there was angst from the Secret Service that we don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there. As we were boarding the plane, someone had picked a reference to \u201cAngel.\u201d That\u2019s the code name for Air Force One. Is someone sitting around with a Stinger missile? Was someone waiting for us at Andrews? Mark [Tillman] was reluctant to fly us back to Washington.\n\nKaren Hughes, communications director, White House: September 10th was my anniversary, so I had stayed back in Washington. I was scheduled to do a Habitat for Humanity event with [Secretary of Housing and Urban Development] Mel Martinez that required us to wear blue jeans. President Bush didn\u2019t allow blue jeans in the West Wing, so I\u2019d just planned to spend the morning at home. When the attacks began, the vice president sent a military driver to pick me up and bring me to the White House, because D.C.\u2019s streets were so clogged.\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg, F-16 pilot, call-sign \u201cHooter,\u201d 111th Fighter Squadron, Houston: I had just gotten off alert at Ellington Field [in Houston], normally we pull 24-hour alerts, mostly for drug interdiction. I\u2019d just gotten back into bed and was watching TV and saw the reports of a plane hitting the tower. Being an airline pilot, an air defense pilot, and the operations officer for the 111th, this was something that intrigued me. I wanted to stay up to see what happened. Then when that second plane hit, it eliminated any doubt. I had to get back to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Airborne, Somewhere over the Gulf of Mexico\n\nThe president\u2019s private cabin and office, the \u201cairborne Oval Office,\u201d sit at the front of Air Force One on the main deck; stairs lead up to the flight deck and communications suite. Other cabins house the White House Medical Unit, staff, guests, security, the press and crew.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: The initial conversation was that we\u2019d take him to an Air Force base, no less than an hour away from Washington. Maybe let\u2019s go ahead and try to get him to Camp David. That all changed when we heard there was a plane headed towards Camp David.\n\nI made the takeoff, climbed out, probably 25,000 to 30,000\u2014I gave it to the backup pilot. I had three pilots on board that day. I said just keep flying towards Washington.\n\nAri Fleischer: As we were flying out of Sarasota, we were able to get some TV reception. They broke for commercial. I couldn\u2019t believe it. A hair-loss commercial comes on. I remember thinking, in the middle of all this, I\u2019m watching this commercial for hair loss.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: Jacksonville Center [Air Traffic Control] was warning us about an unidentified plane in the area. I said let\u2019s change direction and see if it follows. It didn\u2019t.\n\nAndy Card: Blake Gottesman was my personal aide, but he was filling in that day as the president\u2019s aide. I said, \u201cBlake, it\u2019s your job to make sure that people don\u2019t come up to the suite.\u201d No one comes up unless the president calls for them.\n\nAri Fleischer: We got a report there are six aircraft still flying in the U.S. that aren\u2019t responding and could still be hijacked. We\u2019re thinking that there are still six missiles still in the sky. We\u2019re getting a report that a plane \u201cwas down near Camp David.\u201d\n\nKarl Rove: Andy and I are there with the president. The president gets this call from Cheney\u2014we didn\u2019t know who it was at the time, we just knew the phone rang. He said \u201cyes,\u201d then there was a pause as he listened. Then another \u201cyes.\u201d You had an unreal sense of time that whole day. I don\u2019t know whether it was 10 seconds or two minutes. Then he said, \u201cYou have my authorization.\u201d Then he listens for a while longer. He closes off the conversation. He turns to us and says that he\u2019s just authorized the shoot-down of hijacked airliners.\n\nI\u2019d never heard the word \u2018decapitation attack\u2019 before.\u201d\n\nAndy Card: The president is sitting at his desk, and I\u2019m sitting directly in front of him. I witness the president authorize the Air National Guard to shoot down the hijacked airliners. The conversation was sobering to hear. What struck me was as soon as he hung up the phone, he said, \u201cI was an Air National Guard pilot\u2014I\u2019d be one of the people getting this order. I can\u2019t imagine getting this order.\u201d There was a greater degree of reality than many other presidents would have experienced.\n\nKarl Rove: He was so even-handed. He was just so naturally calm during the day.\n\nDave Wilkinson: We didn\u2019t expect the breakdown of communications. Every kind of communication that day was challenged. Even the president talking to the Situation Room was challenged. The communications network did not hold up.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: All the comms that we would normally have, some of them are no longer available. We\u2019ve got multiple systems\u2014commercial and terrestrial systems\u2014and they\u2019re all jammed. I started to have tunnel vision: What the hell is going on? Did someone sabotage our comms? It wasn\u2019t until later I realized all the commercial systems were all just saturated. It was all the same systems the airplane pilots were using at the same time, talking to their dispatchers. We as Air Force One didn\u2019t have any higher priority than American This or United That.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: We started having to use the military satellites, which we would only use in time of war.\n\nAri Fleischer: I\u2019d never heard the word \"decapitation attack\" before, but people like Andy, who had been there during the Cold War and had the training, he knew what was going on. The training and the thinking of the military and the Secret Service is just so profoundly different, but that was the psychology and mood that took hold aboard Air Force One. There are still missiles out there and the Secret Service says to the president, \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for you to return to Washington.\u201d\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: It was very somber [at the air base]. We got these cryptic messages from Southeast Air Defense Sector. We knew we\u2019re on the hook now\u2014it might not be for Air Force One, but for anything. Houston\u2019s the fifth-largest metro region, it\u2019s got all this oil and gas infrastructure. I asked maintenance to put live missiles and arm up the guns. Two heat-seeking missiles and rounds from a 20-mm gun isn\u2019t a lot to take on a hijacked plane, but it was the best we could do.\n\nAndy Card: Then we hear that Flight 93\u2019s gone down. We\u2019re all wondering, Did we do that? It wasn\u2019t a big deal on the plane. It lingered deepest in the president\u2019s conscience. Most people on the plane hadn\u2019t been privy to that conversation.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: All of us thought, we assumed we shot it down.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: All the folks were coming up to the communications deck with various requests, a Secret Service agent comes up and says, \u201cThe president wants to know the status of the first family.\u201d He had this look on his face. I have to tell him I don\u2019t have a way to find out. I can\u2019t fathom what that was like for the president.\n\nDave Wilkinson: Once we heard a plane had crashed into the Pentagon, that\u2019s when we said, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not going to go back to Washington.\u201d It\u2019s all about that \u201cdirection of interest.\u201d At the start, the threat\u2019s right now in New York. Then the plane hit the Pentagon, and it was about our seats of government. Hearing all of this, we\u2019re thinking that the further we\u2019re away from Washington, the safer we are.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: We get this report that there\u2019s a call saying \u201cAngel was next.\u201d No one really knows now where the comment came from\u2014it got mistranslated or garbled amid the White House, the Situation Room, the radio operators. \u201cAngel\u201d was our code name. The fact that they knew about \u201cangel,\u201d well, you had to be in the inner circle. That was a big deal to me. It was time to hunker down and get some good weaponry.\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: We dispatched two fighters to go protect Air Force One.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: Now our security\u2019s tremendous, but we had press on board, there were press that weren\u2019t part of our regular traveling party. We put a cop at the base of the stairs. No one was allowed upstairs. That was something we\u2019d never done before.\n\nBuzz Buzinski: Will Chandler [the lead Air Force security officer] was summoned to the front. Then he stayed up there, providing security at the cockpit stairs. That got us thinking: Is there an insider threat? [Colonel Tillman\u2019s] putting someone at the flight deck. You just don\u2019t know who\u2019s who.\n\nStaff Sgt. Paul Germain: Colonel Tillman says at that point, \u201cLet\u2019s just go cruise around the Gulf for a little bit.\u201d That was our Pearl Harbor. You train for nuclear war, then you get into something like that. All the money they pumped into us for training, that worked. We could read each other\u2019s minds.\n\nBuzz Buzinski: Will [Chandler] told us, \u201cGuys, this is our time. 100 percent security, all of the time. We gotta get the president back.\u201d\n\nDave Wilkinson: Colonel Tillman took us to a height where if an aircraft was coming towards us, we\u2019d know it was no mistake. Talking to him, I was confident we were safer in the air than we were anywhere on the ground.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: I took us up to 45,000 feet. That\u2019s about as high as a 747 can go. I figured I wanted to be above all the other air traffic, especially since everyone was descending to land.\n\nAnn Compton, reporter, ABC News: We were standing in the press cabin. A lot of people were too nervous to sit down. A Secret Service agent was in the aisle and he pointed at the monitor and said, \u201cLook down there, Ann, we\u2019re at 45,000 feet and we have no place to go.\u201d\n\nKarl Rove: There was acrimony. President Bush doesn\u2019t raise his voice. He doesn\u2019t pound the desk. But as we made it across the Florida peninsula, they [Andy Card and Tom Gould] kept raising objections [about returning to Washington]. At one point, Cheney and Rumsfeld called [and advised against returning to Washington].\n\nAri Fleischer: Andy took the side of the Secret Service. Looking back, it\u2019s pretty obvious that you don\u2019t put Air Force One down at a known, predictable location when the attack\u2019s still unfolding. You preserve the office of the president. It was pretty straightforward.\n\nDave Wilkinson: He fought with us tooth and nail all day to go back to Washington. We basically refused to take him back. The way we look at is that by federal law, the Secret Service has to protect the president. The wishes of that person that day are secondary to what the law expects of us. Theoretically it\u2019s not his call, it\u2019s our call.\n\nEric Draper: As a group, you had Tom Gould, Andy Card, and a couple Secret Service guys saying you couldn\u2019t return to Washington. He was visibly frustrated and very angry. I was just a few feet away, and it felt like he was looking through me. It was really intense. He just turned away in anger.\n\nKarl Rove: Gould came in and said, \u201cMr. President, we don\u2019t have a full fuel load. We\u2019ve got too many extraneous people on board. We can\u2019t loiter over Washington if we need to.\u201d He suggested, let\u2019s get to a military base, drop off the unessential personnel, fill up with fuel, and reassess. The president got the argument, but he wasn\u2019t happy about it.\n\nAri Fleischer: We didn\u2019t have satellite TV on the plane. The news would frustratingly come in and go out. So I was not aware of the punishing coverage that the president was receiving for not returning to Washington. The anchors were all asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s Bush?\u201d They instantly criticized him.\n\nSonya Ross: We didn\u2019t know where we were going, but they must\u2019ve been circling, because we kept watching the local feed of a Florida station going in and out. That was our tiny window into the outside world.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: We had limited communications, that\u2019s for sure, but the president and Air Force One were never without secure communications. We just had two lines\u2014one for the president and one for the mil aide. We were never out of touch entirely. All the other staff or the other Secret Service agent, we just couldn\u2019t provide them the calls they needed. There were a couple times when the vice president wasn\u2019t available, but we never lost communications with the ground.\n\nAndy Card: One of the president\u2019s first thoughts, from Sarasota to Barksdale, was Vladimir Putin.\n\nAmerica could have had no better ally on 9/11 than Russia and Putin.\u201d\n\nGordon Johndroe: [Putin] was important\u2014all these military systems were all put in place for nuclear alerts. If we went on alert, we needed Putin to know that we weren\u2019t readying an attack on Russia. He was great\u2014he said immediately that Russia wouldn\u2019t respond, Russia would stand down, that he understood we were under attack and needed to be on alert.\n\nAri Fleischer: Putin was fantastic that day. He was a different Vladimir Putin in 2001. America could have had no better ally on September 11th than Russia and Putin.\n\nEllen Eckert: We were watching that second plane hit on a replay. It wasn\u2019t hitting me yet what had happened, until I saw that second plane hit. I remember thinking \u201cHoly mother of God.\u201d I was sitting back with the press corps and they said, \u201cGo find out what\u2019s happening.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, right, they\u2019re going to tell the steno what\u2019s happening.\u201d Ari came back to the press cabin, and said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t call anybody, please don\u2019t tell anyone where we are for national safety, keep our location secure.\u201d Everyone said, \u201cAbsolutely, how\u2019s the president?\u201d Everyone was really obedient.\n\nSonya Ross: Khue Bui [one of the photographers] was crouched in front of me and we were talking about our families, people we knew in New York. Ann [Compton of ABC News] and I were trying to come up with timelines\u2014what time was it when Andy Card came in and whispered to the president. Ann\u2019s time and my time were about two minutes apart. We were listening through headsets to the television, but we weren\u2019t really paying attention. Then I heard the reporter say, \u201cThe tower\u2019s collapsing.\u201d I looked at the TV and had a completely shocked reaction. I heard Khue\u2019s camera snap.\n\nEric Draper: We were in the president\u2019s office when the Towers fell. You knew that there\u2019d be a loss of life in a catastrophic way. The room was really silent. Andy Card, Ari, and Dan Bartlett were there. There\u2019s an image of the president, with his hands on his hips, just watching. Dan had a friend who worked in the Towers. He was very emotional. Everyone peeled off one by one and the president just stood there, alone, watching the cloud expand.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: There were times when the emotion would just well up. Just that sick feeling, that sorrow. It was the overwhelming stress, like when a friend or family member is dying. That\u2019s the closest thing I can explain what it felt like that day.\n\nAndy Card: I asked the military aides, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I want options. I want a long runway, a secure place, good communications. They came back and said Barksdale AFB. I said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone we\u2019re coming.\u201d\n\nDave Wilkinson: Colonel Tillman said, \u201cWhat about Barksdale?\u201d It was about 45 minutes away. We discussed it, it\u2019s the perfect compromise\u2014it\u2019s close and it\u2019s secure and we can let off a lot of passengers there. We needed somewhere that had armored vehicles.\n\nBush confers with, from left, Karl Rove, Andy Card, Dan Bartlett and Ari Fleischer, prior to delivering remarks at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. | U.S. National Archives\n\nAndy Card: I went into the president\u2019s cabin and told the president, \u201cWe\u2019re going Barksdale.\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re going back to the White House.\u201d He was pretty hot with me. \u201cI\u2019m making the decision, we\u2019re going back to Washington, D.C.\u201d He\u2019s firm as can be. I just kept saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to make that decision right now.\u201d He went back and forth. It wasn\u2019t one conversation, it was five, six, seven conversations. He was really frustrated with me.\n\nEric Draper: I remember following the president and Andy Card into the nose of the plane, the president\u2019s cabin. They\u2019re in a very heated discussion over returning to Washington. They\u2019re arguing, but also having the president take telephone calls at the same time. They\u2019re watching the live news coverage. It was controlled chaos.\n\nAndy Card: We were all thinking about the very credible idea that there was more to come. Is there a plane heading to Los Angeles? A plane headed for Chicago? Something on the train? Is there a truck bomb heading across the George Washington Bridge? We had lots of angst over the White House itself. We even had the fog of war trying to figure what was going on in the White House. There\u2019s a fire in the Eisenhower Office Building\u2014well there was, but it was just in a garbage can.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: We asked for the fighter support. We heard, \u201cYou have fast movers at your 7 o\u2019clock.\u201d They were supersonic, F-16s from the president\u2019s guard unit. They led us into Barksdale.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: We\u2019re flying around, all we still have is local TV. The only benefit was that anything broadcasting was broadcasting the attack. Whatever I locked into, it\u2019d only be good until we flew out of range. We were trying to understand from those pictures like anyone else. It was a whole paradigm shift from what I\u2019d thought about conflict and war growing up. It was a new age.\n\nSandy Kress: There was a lot of discussion about who did it. There was nothing anybody knew. But it was lots of talk\u2014and some fear. I remember the plane banking back across the Gulf. We knew there was a change of plans and direction, but something was diverting the plane.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam: [Rep. Dan Miller and I] went up to the president\u2019s cabin and he gave us a briefing. He told us that \u201cOne way or another\u201d all but a couple planes were accounted for. That was his phrase \u201cone way or another.\u201d He told us Air Force One was headed to Barksdale and was going to drop us off there. When we left the cabin, I turned to Dan and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you think that was an odd phrase?\u201d He didn\u2019t notice it. I said \u201c\u2018One way or another,\u2019 that sounds like that there\u2019s more to it than that.\u201d I said, \u201cDo you think there\u2019s any way we shot them down?\u201d We were left hanging.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck, commander, Barksdale Air Force Base, Shreveport, La.: I was the commander of the 8th Air Force. We were in the midst of this big annual exercise called GLOBAL GUARDIAN. They loaded all the bombers, put the submarines out to sea, put the ICBMs at nearly 100 percent. It was routine, you did it every year.\n\nA captain tapped me on the shoulder and said, \u201cSir, we just had an aircraft hit the World Trade Center.\u201d I started to correct him, saying, \u201cWhen you have an exercise input you have to start by saying, \u2018I have an exercise input.\u2019 That way it doesn\u2019t get confused with the real world.\u201d Then he just pointed me to the TV screens in the command center. You could see smoke pouring out of the building. Like everyone else in aviation that day, I thought, \u201cHow in a clear-and-a-million day could someone hit the World Trade Center?\u201d\n\nKaren Hughes: Since I was home, I saw quite a bit of TV coverage just like the American people were seeing it, and I realized that it looked like the American government was faltering. I was on the phone with my chief of staff at the White House when she was told to evacuate. I could actually see the Pentagon burning. But I knew that lots of government was functioning\u2014planes were being grounded, emergency plans were being implemented. I thought someone should be telling the American people that, so I wanted to talk to the president.\n\nWhen I called the operator to try reach Air Force One, the operator came back on the line and said, \u201cMa\u2019am, we can\u2019t reach Air Force One.\u201d Mary Matalin had passed along that there was a threat against the plane. It was just chilling. For a split second, I was so worried.\n\nGordon Johndroe: I was sitting across the table from Mike Morell in the staff cabin. I asked, \u201cMike, is something else going to happen?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes.\u201d That was a real gut punch. We were going to be attacked all day long. There were so many rumors\u2014the State Department, the Mall, the White House.\n\nBrian Montgomery: I asked [Mike Morell] who he thought this was. He said \u201cUBL.\u201d No hesitation. \u201cWho\u2019s UBL?\u201d Those of us not up on the lingo of Langley, we had no idea.\n\nMike Morell: The president called me into his cabin. It was packed with people. The Democratic Front for Liberation of Palestine had issued a claim of responsibility for the attack. The president asked me, \u201cWhat do you know about these guys?\u201d I explained that they had a long history of terrorism, but this group doesn\u2019t have the capability to do this. Guaranteed.\n\nAs I was leaving, he said to me, \u201cMichael, one more thing. Call George Tenet and tell him that if he finds out anything about who did it, I want to be the first to know. Got that?\u201d I said, \u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\nSonya Ross: I got the first readout [report] from Ari. The answers we were getting there were pretty incomplete. Ari and his team were giving us the best answers they could. I was nervous. I was thinking\u2014it seems really morbid\u2014but I was thinking, \u201cWhat if they come after the president? We all turn into \u2018and 12 others.\u2019 No one knows your name if you go down with the president. But Eric Washington, he was the CBS sound guy, he had his seat reclined, his feet up. He said, \u201cWhat are you worried about? You\u2019re on the safest plane in the world.\u201d\n\nAir Force One was the safest and most dangerous place in the world at the same exact time.\u201d\n\nGordon Johndroe: [Air Force One] was the safest and most dangerous place in the world at the exact same time.\n\nKaren Hughes: When I finally did reach Air Force One and spoke with the president, the first thing he said to me was \u201cDon\u2019t you think I need to come back?\u201d He was just champing at the bit to come back. I told him, \u2018Yes, as soon as you can.\u2019 Everyone has different roles and I wasn\u2019t thinking about the national security side\u2014I was just thinking about it from a PR perspective.\n\nAndy Card: Mark [Tillman] said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what he says, I\u2019m in charge of the plane.\u201d\n\nDave Wilkinson: The president once told me that the biggest piece of advice he\u2019d gotten from his mother when he became president was always do what the Secret Service says. I reminded him of that several times that day. The president and I knew each other very well\u2014we\u2019d spent a lot of hours at his ranch\u2014and kind of tongue-in-cheek several times that day, I said, \u201cRemember what your mother said.\u201d\n\nAri Fleischer: One of the recurring themes of September 11th is how much of the initial reporting was wrong. I keep that in mind every day now as I watch President Obama and world events. In normal situations, there are many ranks and many filters in government, so that only that which is proven and vital reaches the president. All of that broke down on 9/11. No one in the security apparatus wanted to be negligent in not passing things along. The media was part of that too. All those filters broke down.\n\nAndy Card: The fog of war is real. You can be in a car accident and everyone in the car crash has a different perspective. Take that and multiple that a million times. The first estimates of the casualties were so way off. 10,000 people in New York, 1,000 people at the Pentagon.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: There were so many people coming up to the upper deck, because we weren\u2019t picking up the phones downstairs. It got too crowded. Finally, someone came up and told everyone to get out. The only member of the staff that was up with us was Harriet Miers\u2014she was sitting at one of the CSO seats, with a legal pad taking historical record.\n\nAndy Card: The president\u2019s wondering about his wife, his kids, his parents. Then he\u2019s wondering, is there another city? What\u2019s next? And we\u2019re all thinking, we can\u2019t do anything about it. We\u2019re in a plane, eight miles high in the sky.\n\nDave Wilkinson: We called Mark Rosenker up to the front of the plane and told him to get us on the phone with the commander at Barksdale. He gave us full assurance that the base would be locked down.\n\nAndy Card: I was comforted to find Barksdale was already on alert. It was going to be secure. No random terrorist would have mapped that Barksdale was where the president was going to go. We didn\u2019t have to ring some bell and everyone would run out of the firehouse. Everyone was already out.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: We were already in a practice THREATCON Delta, the highest threat condition. I said lock her down for real. My deputy came in, Lt. Colonel Paul Tibbets\u2014his grandfather was the pilot who flew the Enola Gay [which dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima]. He told me that at THREATCON Delta, general officers have to wear sidearms. I tried to refuse, but he insisted. So I was wearing my sidearm, which I never do.\n\nWe got this radio request\u2014Code Alpha\u2014a high priority incoming aircraft. It wanted 150,000 pounds of gas, 40 gallons of coffee, 70 box lunches, and 25 pounds of bananas. It wouldn\u2019t identify itself. It was clearly a big plane. It didn\u2019t take us long to figure out that the Code Alpha was Air Force One.\n\nAnn Compton: We were landing going into Barksdale, Ari came back to the press cabin and said, \u201cThis is off the record, but the president is being evacuated.\u201d I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t put that off the record. That\u2019s a historic and chilling fact. That has to be on the record.\u201d It was a stunning statement, about the president trying to hold the country together but facing a mortal enemy. The president cannot be found because of his own safety. That sent chills down my spine.\n\n\n\n\n\nIII. Barksdale Air Force Base, Shreveport, La.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: Going into Barksdale, there\u2019s this plane that appears. The initial fighters were with us. I still remember the F-16s starting in on this guy. Bearing, range, altitude, distance. You see the F-16 rolls off, they ask, \u201cHey, who has shoot-down authority?\u201d I say, \u201cYou do.\u201d That was a big moment. It turned out just to be a crop duster, some civilian flyer who didn\u2019t get the word.\n\nGordon Johndroe: You cannot hide a blue-and-white 747 that says \u201cUnited States of America\u201d across the top. You can\u2019t move it secretly through the daylight. Where does local TV go when there\u2019s a national emergency? They go out to their local military base. We\u2019re watching ourselves land on local television. The announcer\u2019s saying, \u201cIt appears Air Force One is landing. We don\u2019t have any specific information whether the president was on board, but Air Force One was last seen leaving Sarasota.\u201d The pool is looking at me like, \u201cWe can\u2019t report this?\u201d\n\nBrian Montgomery: As soon as we landed, Mark Rosenker [director of the White House Military Office] and I went off the back stairs. There\u2019s this guy who looks like General Buck Turgidson from Dr. Strangelove, big guy, all decked out in a bomber jacket. He was straight out of central casting. We said, \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d He said, \u201cSee those planes? Every one is loaded with nukes\u2014tell me where you want \u2019em.\u201d We look over and there are just rows of B-52s, wingtip to wingtip. I joked, \u201cGosh, don\u2019t tell [the president!].\u201d\n\nWe got this radio request\u2014Code Alpha\u2014a high priority incoming aircraft. It wanted 150,000 pounds of gas, 40 gallons of coffee, 70 box lunches and 25 pounds of bananas. It wouldn\u2019t identify itself.\u201d\n\nBuzz Buzinski: Barksdale was going through a nuclear surety inspection. They already had these cops in flak jackets and M-16s. They were all locked and loaded. It\u2019s pretty no-joke when you\u2019re assigned to a nuclear base already. But you still knew that this was going to be different. As soon as we landed, they surrounded the aircraft.\n\nCapt. Cindy Wright, presidential nurse, White House Medical Unit: I remember just how different it was, landing at Barksdale. Everything just had changed in an instant. We\u2019d got off the plane and we were at war.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: When we landed there, looking out towards the flight line, it looked like a war game. You had guys in flak jackets, weapons, heavy equipment and vehicles, guns mounted on top. All facing away from the aircraft.\n\nDave Wilkinson: My biggest concern was the Humvees. Would they be there? We had guys from our local field office rushing over, but they didn\u2019t get there until after. When I saw the four or five Humvees pull up, I had a real sense of relief. One of the other agents raised the concern that the Air Force wanted to drive the president\u2014we [the Secret Service] are normally the only people who drive the president. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the least of our concerns. If the general\u2019s signing off on the guy driving, that\u2019s fine with me. Let\u2019s just let him drive the vehicle.\u201d\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: We let the president out through the bottom stairs, because you want that low vantage point in case there\u2019s a sniper.\n\nAri Fleischer: Normally, there\u2019s a whole infrastructure that flies ahead of the president. It\u2019s an armed city, full of Secret Service agents and armored vehicles. But on that day, even the Secret Service is down to just the essential crew aboard the plane. All that was waiting for him in Barksdale was this uparmored Humvee, with room for a standing gunner. The regular Air Force driver, he was nervous and just driving as fast as could be. The president told him to slow down. The president said later he most felt in danger [on 9/11] right there on the runway.\n\nAndy Card: The guy was driving really fast, and in a Humvee the center of gravity isn\u2019t as low as you think. The president said, \u201cSlow down, son, there are no terrorists on this base! You don\u2019t have to kill me now!\u201d\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: I went down to the tarmac to see about having the plane refueled. We could carry 14 hours of fuel. I wanted 14 hours of fuel. I was worried that they weren\u2019t going to have enough fuel trucks, but it turned out we\u2019d happened to park over a hot refueling tank they used for bombers. This civilian is arguing with our crew, \u201cThe fuel pits are only authorized for use in time of war.\u201d This Air Force master sergeant\u2014God bless him\u2014overhears this and roars, \u201cWe are at war!\u201d He whips out his knife and starts cutting open the cover. That defines to me what the day was like.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: [The president] had landed already and I was on my way to meet him. He was on his way to the conference center. I gave a sharp salute, and his first words to me were, \u201cI guess I put you on the map.\u201d He was really disarming that way. He told me he needed a secure phone to call Governor Pataki, so I took him to my office. As he started making calls, he stopped for a second: \u201cTell me where I am?\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re on the east side of the Red River in Bossier City, Barksdale Air Force base, near Shreveport, Louisiana.\u201d\n\nBrian Montgomery: Once the president got into that private office, Andy Card came out and said this is an opportunity to call your loved ones, but don\u2019t tell them where you are.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam: We get to Barksdale, keep in mind that we haven\u2019t really had good TV images. We were all overwhelmed with emotion, because we were all catching up to where everyone else had had a couple hours to process. I called my wife and said, \u201cI\u2019m safe. I can\u2019t tell you where I am.\u201d And she said, \u201cOh, I thought you were in Barksdale? That\u2019s what I saw on TV.\u201d\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: The horn went off again [at Ellington Field in Houston] and [F-16 pilot Shane Brotherton and I] launched. There was so little information, you had to do things on faith. When we launched, we didn\u2019t even know what the mission was. We were told, \"You need to intercept the Angel flight.\" Well, we had no idea what that meant. We\u2019d never heard Air Force One called that before.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: Andy Card and Karl Rove came into my office with him.\n\nKarl Rove: This is the first point where he gets fully briefed. All three strikes are over, so we know the extent of the damage. His first instinct was to bring together the leaders of government, but everyone had dispersed. It\u2019s just amazing how technology has changed. At the time, the only way to get everyone together was to go to Offutt Air Force Base, the nearest facility that had multiple-site video teleconferencing. Now the president travels with a black Halliburton case that has a screen that can do it through any broadband outlet. It\u2019s amazing.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: I went into the base situation room. I told them I needed to get this guy underground. Where were all the places that I could do that? Offutt was the best choice.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: People forget how much confusion there was that day about what was actually going on. We\u2019d never been attacked like that before, at least since Pearl Harbor. Intel [officers] were coming in all the time. One said that there was a high-speed object moving towards his Texas ranch [in Crawford]. I saw him start thinking about who was at the ranch. It turned out to be a false report.\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: I was thinking\u2014I\u2019ve done these Combat Air Patrols over southern Iraq for hundreds of hours, enforcing the no-fly zone, and now I\u2019m doing it over the United States. It was really strange. No one else was airborne. It just felt so serious. We had all this resolve that day.\n\nEllen Eckert: To wait for the president, they took us to the Officers\u2019 Club. I was basically the only person on the trip who smoked cigarettes\u2014or so I thought. While we\u2019re standing there, all of a sudden everyone\u2019s asking for a cigarette. \u201cWait, you don\u2019t smoke?\u201d Everyone was so whipped up.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: Everyone was busy doing their own thing. The president was looking over the remarks he wanted to give the country. He asked the room, \u201cI use the word \u2018resolve\u2019 twice in here\u2014do I want to do that?\u201d No one was answering him, so I said, \u201cI think Americans probably want to hear that.\u201d\n\nBrian Montgomery: We got with someone from the base, and found this rec room or something like that with a bunch of memorabilia on the walls. Gordon and I started rearranging everything\u2014got some flags, found a podium. We knew this was important. Everyone wanted to see the president.\n\nGordon Johndroe: Barksdale was a blur. It was really chaotic. No one really remembers the president\u2019s statement there. It was bad lighting, bad setting, but it was important to have him say something to the nation. That statement is lost to history.\n\nSonya Ross: I dictated a brief report to my colleague Sandra Sobieraj [back in Washington], and then I left my phone on, so she could hear the president\u2019s brief statement. The statement was supposed to be embargoed until we left, so I was trying to curl the phone up under my notebook, so no one would notice it was still on. It gave us a brief head start, because the wire [services], we always need to be first. He said, \u201cOur military at home and around the world is on high alert status. And we have taken the necessary security precautions to continue the functions of your government.\u201d He reiterated that it was a terrorist attack and urged people to be calm. It was very general.\n\nEllen Eckert: I\u2019d never seen the president look so stern. I was lying on the ground at the president\u2019s feet. We didn\u2019t know if the [TV news] feed was working, it was so iffy, so I was there lying down with my mic above my head in case no one else was recording his remarks.\n\nAndy Card: We didn\u2019t want attention to where we were until we left. We videotaped the statement, so that it went out as we left.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: After the press conference, he came back to my office. He hadn\u2019t seen video of the Towers come down yet. He was sitting on my couch and watched the Towers fall. He turned to me, just because I was there, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know who this is, but we\u2019re gonna find out, and we\u2019re going to go after them, we\u2019re not just going to slap them on the wrist.\u201d I said, \u201cWe\u2019re with you.\u201d I knew he meant every word.\n\nAri Fleischer: Andy Card made the decision to chop down the number of passengers. We didn\u2019t know where we were going. We had no infrastructure. We had no motorcade. Anybody non-essential had to be left behind, that included all the congressmen, which they weren\u2019t pleased with. Several White House staffers had to get off. Andy asked if we could take the press down to three. I thought five was the absolute minimum.\n\nSandy Kress: Most of us had stayed on the plane in Barksdale. We were sitting on the runway for a good bit. We were thinking, \u201cIs this a broader attack? Was someone out there looking for us?\u201d It was towards the end of the stop in Barksdale that Brian [Montgomery] came through and told us that we were all staying behind in Louisiana. We understood that the president was continuing on, but that he was not going back to D.C. Our role had been to help him with that trip, and that was over. It made sense.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam: As we\u2019re just waiting on board, supply trucks come up and start unloading food\u2014tray after tray of meat, loaf after loaf of bread, just hundreds of gallons of water. We realize they\u2019re equipping that plane to be in the air for days. It was really unnerving.\n\nGordon Johndroe: We thought at that point that we were not going to Washington for several days. We needed to shrink down our footprint. We didn\u2019t know how many people could be fed, watered, clothed, and supported wherever we were going. It was difficult telling half the press pool that they weren\u2019t coming with us. It was half \"We\u2019re missing the story of our lifetimes,\" and then their personal reaction: \"You\u2019re leaving us in Louisiana and the airspace was shut down.\"\n\nSonya Ross: They herded us out to a blue school bus. Some of us had rumors that they\u2019d shrink the pool. I was thinking I had to fight to get a spot. I didn\u2019t want to have to explain to my boss that I got left behind. I was just going to do my best to get on the plane. Gordon came on the bus. He read off who was going to come with them: AP reporter, AP photographer, TV camera, TV sound, and radio. Everyone else, he said, was going to be left behind. At that point, Judy Keen, the newspaper reporter from USA Today, and Jay Carney, the magazine pooler, they raised a stink. I just scooped up my stuff and ran.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: In the conference room, waiting for the transportation to be squared away, we were sitting around the table, wondering what brought the Towers down. At that point, no one understood that steel melted at such-and-such a temperature. We just couldn\u2019t believe the towers had come down. When it came time to take the president back [to Air Force One], they brought up this Humvee with a .50-cal machine gun mounted on top. I don\u2019t know if he was fearing a Governor Dukakis moment in that tank, but he wanted to ride in a different vehicle. He pointed to our supervisor of flying vehicle. It was a white minivan, which we called \u201cSoccer Mom,\u201d so we drove him out in a minivan.\n\nKarl Rove: As we\u2019re driving back out, [the president] says to me something like, \u201cI know this is a dodge, just they\u2019re going to try to keep me away, but I\u2019m going to let them have this one [and go to Offutt] and then we\u2019re going home. \u201c\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: [As the president\u2019s heading up the stairs] I said to him, \u201cThese troops are trained, ready, and they\u2019ll do whatever you want them to.\u201d He said to me, \u201cI know.\u201d We traded salutes. He was on the ground an hour and 53 minutes.\n\nBuzz Buzinski: I saw [the president] walk up the front stairs. You could see how mad he was. You could tell how much emotion he had, the anger inside. As soon as he got on board, it was all business.\n\nSandy Kress: They sent the vice president\u2019s plane down for us, and we eventually boarded it to go back to D.C.\n\nSonya Ross: As we left, they didn\u2019t know how long we\u2019d be gone. They told us that they\u2019d arrange accommodations if we had to be gone a day or two. I told my bureau chief, \u201cI don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going and I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be gone.\u201d\n\nEllen Eckert: Ari told me I was off the plane. The press were not happy, but I was fine\u2014I was thinking, I\u2019m safe here in Louisiana. But then the plane\u2019s fired up, it\u2019s loud, we\u2019re all standing nearby, and Gordon came back to the back stairs, he yells, \u201cEllen, Ari says get on the plane! He\u2019s changed his mind!\u201d That\u2019s not what I want to do\u2014but then I thought I\u2019m ashamed of myself. Everyone else was getting on that plane. I was the last one on board.\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. Airborne, Somewhere Over the Plains\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: We watched Air Force One come up, but we still don\u2019t really know anything. It\u2019s pretty impressive, seeing Air Force One come up in the air.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: As he takes off, two F-16s pulled up on his wing. That made me think that we were finally getting our act together. I forgot I ever said this, but Kurt Bedke, one of the other officers, told me later that as we watched them fly away I said to him, \u201cDo you feel like you\u2019re in a Tom Clancy novel?\u201d\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: We just started following [Air Force One] north. At some point, I was expecting them to turn east and head to Washington. The longer we\u2019re heading north, the more realize something\u2019s still unsettled. They still don\u2019t feel safe returning to Washington. We only had maps for Texas and Louisiana that day on board. There was no idea that we\u2019d go any further than that. I asked for a tanker to come meet up, and after I hook up, I asked him for every radio channel between here and Canada.\n\nAndy Card: We could finally get some television coverage. You could see the buildings on fire. You saw the replay of the collapse. There were lots of tears. There were lots of quiet moments staring at a TV screen. No conversation. There were prayers. And the fear. It wasn\u2019t even a roller coaster, because we were just in the pits. Oh my god, that\u2019s terrible. And that\u2019s worse. And that\u2019s even worse. All the time, we\u2019re being handed notes, taking telephone calls, giving orders.\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: It was an eerie silence on the radio. There\u2019s just no one in the air. We\u2019re just talking among ourselves [the fighter pilots] on our radios. \u201cI wonder if we\u2019re going to Canada?\u201d A lot of, \u201cMan, this is fucked up.\u201d I\u2019m also talking the guys through what happens if we have to shoot someone down. The world\u2019s watching, let\u2019s be by the book and let\u2019s do everything we can to protect the president. You\u2019re going to do everything you can to avoid it, but, as a last resort, if a plane\u2019s going to try to hit Air Force One, I need you guys to think about it. I\u2019m saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best to get them to say \u2018you\u2019re approved\u2019 over the radio.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re going to have think about how you\u2019re saving lives by taking lives. You have to think through that the missiles might not do the job. You may have to employ the gun. Typically our gun sight doesn\u2019t account for a plane that big. We know this would be a plum target, but we also figure no one would expect Air Force One right now to be flying north over Kansas.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: The whole day was eerie. There were no radio calls. Controllers were telling us about suspicious planes\u2014I had no idea there were so many crop dusters in America.\n\nEric Draper: Everyone was starving for information. We couldn\u2019t hear anything unless the plane was flying over a major city.\n\nAri Fleischer: There was no live television. It put us in a very different spot than most Americans that day. People around the world were just riveted to their television sets. We had it intermittently on Air Force One. We had it in Barksdale at the base commander\u2019s office. But there\u2019s no email on Air Force One back then. When you\u2019re in the air, you\u2019re cut off. It was absolutely stunning, standing next to the president as he was talking to the vice president then holding the phone off his ear because it cut off.\n\nEllen Eckert: The plane is like the Twilight Zone. It\u2019s really eerie. There\u2019s just no one on board anymore. The staff cabin is empty, the guest cabin is empty. That\u2019s when it was really coming apart for me. I saw one of the agents was standing in the hallway, and I went up to him, \"So this is the safest place to be? This is Air Force One, right?\" He said, \"Well, listen, don\u2019t mention this, but we might as well have a big red X on the bottom of this plane. We\u2019re the only plane in the sky.\" That was scary. I went into the bathroom and used one of those Air Force One notepads to write a letter to my family\u2014six siblings and two parents. They\u2019re never going to see this, it\u2019s going to burn up in a fiery inferno. One of the flight attendants opened the door and comforted me and gave me a washcloth to wipe. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this. We\u2019re all together.\u201d\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: [As we flew to Offutt] some of the commercial systems finally began to become available. One of the phones actually rang, I picked it up, it was my chief: \u201cHow are things going?\u201d \u201cWell, chief, we\u2019re a little busy.\u201d None of the crew were allowed to make calls to our families. Everyone was just locked in. It probably actually helped a lot of us get through the day.\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: Fifteen minutes after we tanked up, we saw Air Force One start to descend. I did the math and figured out they were probably headed to Offutt. Well, now we had a full tank of gas. You can\u2019t land like that in a small plane, so we were doing afterburner 360s at 7,000-feet to burn off enough gas to land our planes.\n\nMike Morell: On the way from Barksdale to Offutt, the president asked to see me alone\u2014it was just me, him, and Andy Card. He asked me, \u201cMichael, who did this?\u201d I explained that I didn\u2019t have any actual intelligence, so what you\u2019re going to get is my best guess. He was really focused and said, \u201cI understand, get on with it.\u201d\n\nI said that there were two countries capable of carrying out an attack like this, Iran and Iraq. But I believed both would have everything to lose and nothing to gain from the attack. When all was said and done, the trail would lead to UBL. I told him \u201cI\u2019d bet my children\u2019s future on that.\u201d\n\nHe asked when we\u2019d know. I walked him through recent cases\u2014in the [1998] East Africa [Embassy] bombings, it had been a couple days, the [2001] USS Cole [bombing] had taken a couple months, the [1996] Khobar Towers [bombing] it had taken over a year. It may be quick or it may be a long while. The whole time, I didn\u2019t realize the CIA had already figured it out.\n\nWhen I finished, he didn\u2019t say anything, we just sat there. It felt like three, four, five minutes. It was getting awkward. I finally said, \u201cIs there anything else, Mr. President?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, Michael, thank you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nV. Offutt Air Force Base\n\nBuzz Buzinski: Landing at Offutt was probably the one funny moment of the day. I\u2019m a big guy\u20146-foot-4, 270\u2014but Will [Chandler\u2019s] also a huge guy, he\u2019s a 6-3, 250. We always said he\u2019s got hands the size of a TV screen. Well, we\u2019re the first two off the plane. The rear stairs are always down first, you get off and guide the front stairs in. When we get off, underneath the jet are five or six maintainers, who were trying to plug the plane into ground power. No one told us they\u2019d be there\u2014all we see are this group of five guys. Chandler yells: \u201cClear the area!\u201d He just let out this bellow. Well, it was like cats scattering\u2014they dropped radios, dropped the cable. They\u2019re panicked\u2014there\u2019s this big guy coming at them. It was hysterical. I just laughed.\n\nAdm. Richard Mies, commander, U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Offut Air Force Base, Omaha, Nebraska: Without knowing whether he was coming to Omaha, we\u2019d taken the initiative to start preparing, working with the 55th Wing, which runs Offutt. We\u2019d started to evacuate the main quarters that could be used for VIPs, and install some of the protection there that\u2019d be needed in case he needed to spend the night.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know that he was coming to Offutt until about 15 minutes before. There wasn\u2019t much communication with Air Force One at all. There wasn\u2019t going to be any pomp and circumstance. I had my driver and a Secret Service agent who we had, and the three of us went out to the runway to greet Air Force One. It was just a plain Chrysler.\n\nDave Wilkinson: By the time we got to STRATCOM, there were like 15 to 20 planes still unaccounted for [nationwide]. People will say it was only six, but there were a lot more than that. For everything we knew, they were all hijacked. But, even as we landed, they started to kick them off quickly.\n\nAdm. Richard Mies: I decided to bring the president down into the command center via the fire escape entrance. That was the most expedient option. I\u2019d never used it before. It was there for emergencies. I had them open it from the inside.\n\nBrian Montgomery: There were a lot of airmen in battle gear lining the route to the bunker. We pull up to this five-story office building, and instead of walking in the front door, the admiral says, \u201cNo, we\u2019re going in there.\u201d We head into this concrete building, just a door. We went down and down and down, pretty far underground.\n\nAt left, President George W. Bush arrives Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2001, at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. At right, Bush, Admiral Richard Mies, left, and White House Chief of Staff Andy Card conduct a video teleconference at the base. | Courtesy of the George W. Bush Presidential Library\n\nGordon Johndroe: The president went into the bunker. It was chilling. I\u2019m watching [the president] with the press from the motorcade and they go into this building and they\u2019re gone. When we got to Omaha, we were tired. Our energy, the stress had ebbed and flowed. A sadness kicked in when we got to Omaha. We didn\u2019t really have time to reflect before then.\n\nEllen Eckert: When he went into the bunker, wow. That\u2019s still a scene in the movie in my head all these years later. Clearly the only way to go was down. We just stood outside, waiting. We smoked a million cigarettes, all my new chain-smoking friends.\n\nEric Draper: I finally had a chance to call my wife, I said, \u201cHoney, I\u2019m going to be home a little late tonight.\u201d I could hear her laugh through the phone, even as she was crying. She said, \u201cI saw you with the president, so I knew you were OK.\u201d\n\nAdm. Richard Mies: We went directly into the command center. That really caught his attention. All these soldiers, they\u2019re all in battle dress. CNN was prominently displayed\u2014a lot of footage of the two towers. We had four to six TV screens, all energized. I sat him down where I normally sit, and walked him through what he was seeing, so he had an awareness.\n\nAndy Card: It\u2019s right out of a TV movie set\u2014all these flat-screen TVs, all these military people, you can hear the fog of war, all these communications from the FAA and the military. But it\u2019s tough for the military folks\u2014they all want to stand and show respect to the commander in chief, but you can tell they want to sit and do their jobs. Everyone is schizophrenic, half-sitting and half standing, everyone\u2019s moving around. After a few minutes, the president turned to me, \u201cI want to get out of here, I\u2019m making it hard for these people to do their job.\u201d\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: All the rules that fighter pilots spend their lives living by were now out the window. When we landed [at Offut] we got more gas and picked up maps for the rest of the country. There are always maps and approaches for the country in base operations, but all the maps always say, \"Do not remove from base operations.\" We just took all of them and stuffed them in our bag.\n\nColonel Tillman walked into base operations and we finally started to get some information. The president was actually an alumni of our unit in Houston. Colonel Tillman told us, \u201che feels comfortable with you guys and wants you to continue us.\u201d We told him we\u2019d sit back about five miles\u2014you don\u2019t get that close to something that valuable, for all sorts of reasons\u2014but if something happened, we can eat up that range real quick.\n\nAdm. Richard Mies: The VTC was just the three of us, the operator, and his military aide. There were just five of us at most. There was no real audience. We listened as everyone reported in. Richard Clarke [of the National Security Council], [Transportation Secretary] Norm Mineta, [Deputy Secretary of State] Richard Armitage, [National Security Adviser] Condi [Rice], [CIA Director] George Tenet. Most of the initial conversation in the VTC was focused on who did this. There was a lot of speculation. It was too early to make definitive. Then we were talking about: How do we restore some sense of normalcy quickly, both for New York and for the country? And then how does the president get back to Washington?\n\nMike Morell: When Tenet explained that he had evidence pointing to Al Qaeda, the president turned around and looked at me\u2014his look clearly said, \u201cWhat the fuck happened here?\u201d You were supposed to tell me first. I tried to explain with my look that I was sorry\u2014I didn\u2019t know how my message had gotten lost. I went to a nearby office and called Tenet\u2019s assistant, angry. I felt like I\u2019d let the president down.\n\nAndy Card: When George Tenet said it was Al Qaeda, it wasn\u2019t like dawn breaking over Marblehead. We all suspected that it was Al Qaeda. I\u2019d thought that since the classroom door. It wasn\u2019t that dramatic of a moment actually. It was just a confirmation. Think of what it would\u2019ve happened if he\u2019d told us that it was Russia, China, or another nation-state? Or an American splinter group?\n\nDave Wilkinson: We felt like we were probably pretty safe and it could be prudent to go back. Everyone went around the room [on the video conference], the vice president kicked it off, and everyone said their piece. Finally, the president said to Brian [Stafford], my boss [the Secret Service director], \u201cBrian, Dave and Eddie are just doing their job and telling me I can\u2019t go back to D.C., but I think it\u2019s time for me to come back.\u201d Brian did a good job\u2014he explained [to the president] that it was a heightened security environment, and we\u2019re were going to relocate you and move you if the slightest thing comes up.\n\nBrian Montgomery: Once we got to Offutt, you would have had to tie him down to keep there overnight.\n\nJulie Ziegenhorn, public affairs officer, Offutt Air Force Base: We were working at our desks and all of a sudden, there was the President striding down the hallway. He walked right out the front door, waving to us. He shouted, \u201cThanks for all you\u2019re doing!\u201d\n\nGordon Johndroe: We\u2019re there with the pool and our Secret Service agent says, \u201cOh my gosh, we\u2019ve got to go right now. The president\u2019s leaving.\u201d Ann [Compton] was on with Peter Jennings. I didn\u2019t want to panic her or the nation by making it seem like we were leaving abruptly, but we needed to leave. I mouthed, \u201cWe have to go.\u201d She was on the radio and she said, \u201cI\u2019m told we\u2019re leaving. I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going.\u201d Peter Jennings said, \u201cGodspeed, Annie.\u201d\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: We thought he was going to be there for a while. I was in base operations and someone came in and said, \u201cI think the president\u2019s headed back to the plane.\u201d I said, \u201cNah.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m pretty sure I just saw him drive by.\u201d I started to race back to the plane. He\u2019d already gotten there. He\u2019s waiting at the top of the stairs and told me, \u201cTillman, we got to get back home. Let\u2019s get back home.\u201d\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: No one told us that Air Force One was leaving, so we\u2019re like, \u201cOh shit, are they starting up?\u201d We\u2019re racing to get our planes in the air, but it takes some time. We met the minimum safety requirements and hit the air. A 747 configured like that, gosh, that\u2019s a fast airplane. We didn\u2019t want to go supersonic, it\u2019d burn up too much fuel, so we talked to them, and we had to reel them in.\n\n\n\n\n\nVI. Airborne, En route to Andrews Air Force Base, Washington, D.C.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: I\u2019m doing .94 Mach. The fighters only have so much gas. We went as fast as we could across the United States. F-16s were coming out of D.C. to meet us, everyone was joining up with us. We had F-15s with us too.\n\nMike Morell: On the flight to Andrews, I finally got this packet full of all the intelligence CIA had. It included the talking points that George Tenet had used to brief the president, but there was still a lot he hadn\u2019t been able to say. I shared all those details with the president. The second half of the packet was a set of intelligence passed to us by a European ally explaining that it had detected signs that Al Qaeda was planning a second wave. When I was showing that to the president, I could tell from his reaction, it struck him: \u201cGosh, this could happen again.\u201d This isn\u2019t over.\n\nAndy Card: When he talked to his dad, his dad reinforced George W. Bush\u2019s desire to get back to Washington. That made me feel a little guilty, but by then we were on our way back.\n\nEric Draper: I asked Andy Card at one point, \u201cWho did this?\u201d \u201cAl Qaeda.\u201d I\u2019d never heard of Al Qaeda before.\n\nAndy Card: By the time we\u2019re coming from STRATCOM, it was kind of skeleton crew aboard. The closer we got to Washington, the more the president wandered.\n\nBrian Montgomery: I found the president at the front of the staff cabin at one point. I just said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to hit \u2019em hard, right, when this is all over?\u201d He just said, \u201cYes, yes, we are.\u201d I knew that look in his eyes. He was mad.\n\nEllen Eckert: The president came back to the press cabin, I asked him if he was doing OK, and he said yes. I asked, \u201cHave you spoken to Mrs. Bush?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, she\u2019s fine.\u201d He patted me on the back, twice. Then Doug Mills [the AP photographer] said, \u201cKeep your spirits up.\u201d\n\nThe president said, \u201cWe won\u2019t let a thug bring this country down.\u201d\n\nSonya Ross: I was typing away [in the press cabin], working on my notes [when the president came in], and I don\u2019t think he saw me at first. I started typing that quote down, and he heard me typing and turned to me: \u201cHey, off the record!\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything else.\n\nEllen Eckert: He gave Sonya the stink eye.\n\nGordon Johndroe: There was one time when President Bush slipped back there\u2014I was in the staff cabin with Andy Card and don\u2019t know how he got back there\u2014and he came in and said, \u201cI just spoke with the press.\u201d He saw my face and said quickly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s OK. It was off the record.\u201d He was trying to be a very calm and comforting presence to everyone.\n\nThe president is consoled by presidential nurse Cindy Wright, of the White House Medical Unit, aboard Air Force One. | Eric Draper/George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\n\nEric Draper: Everyone was trying to take it all in. I took this picture of Cindy Wright, a White House nurse, rubbing the president\u2019s back. At another moment, the president had his arm around Harriet Miers as they walked down the plane.\n\nCapt. Cindy Wright: What\u2019s funny about that picture is I don\u2019t really remember being compassionate or ministering to him\u2014I do remember that he came in to check on me and the team. It was amazing to me that he was walking through the plane checking on us. I was in the medical compartment. It was still fairly new in the administration, so we knew each other from talking and being at the ranch, but that was the first time we hugged\u2014I\u2019m a big hugger, and he is too.\n\nAnn Compton: We were finally able to say on the record\u2014I called my bureau and told them\u2014that the president was heading back to Washington and would address the nation from the Oval Office.\n\nSonya Ross: I had started on the White House beat on September 11th, six years earlier. I said to Ari at some point, \u201cThis is my White House anniversary.\u201d He laughed, \u201cSome anniversary party you threw.\u201d\n\nCol. Dr. Richard Tubb: The thing at that moment I was most worried about was a biologic [attack]. In the unlikely but high-risk scenario, I thought there was little harm to be prophylaxing the staff with antibiotics. It seemed like almost science fiction. I gave everyone on the plane a week of Cipro. I hoped by the time they ran out, we\u2019d have figured out the fog of war and know whether we needed to continue measures.\n\nBrian Montgomery: I noticed that Dr. Tubb was walking and talking to each person. He\u2019d lean over and whisper to each person, pat them on the shoulder, and he\u2019d hand over a little envelope, like what the military uses to put pills in. He got to me and said, \u201cMonty\u201d\u2014that was my nickname\u2014\u201chow do you feel?\u201d I said, \u201cOther than the obvious, physically, I feel fine.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t feel disoriented?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d Then he said, \u201cHave you ever heard of Cipro? We don\u2019t know what might\u2019ve been in that school, so we\u2019re just being careful.\u201d I asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s it used for?\u201d He told me, \u201cIn case it\u2019s anthrax.\u201d\n\nCol. Dr. Richard Tubb: It was scary later realizing later that fall anthrax wasn\u2019t as unimaginable as we\u2019d thought. That was a turning point for our society. I was suddenly real pleased with how we\u2019d reacted on the plane.\n\nAt left, Marine One prepares to land on the South Lawn of the White House. At right, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice waits at the South Portico for Bush to return. | U.S. National Archives\n\nMike Morell: It was about an hour from touching down, pretty late in the day, a lot of people were asleep, and the lights on Air Force One were turned down. The president came back into the staff compartment. I was the only one awake. I said, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just fine, thanks for asking.\u201d One of the things that struck me, he transformed right before my eyes from a president who was struggling a bit with the direction of his administration on September 10th, to a wartime president, just in a matter of hours. I could already see this new confidence and power in him.\n\nGordon Johndroe: I don\u2019t really remember eating, but the stewards put out some sandwiches and chips. The Air Force bills you for your meals aboard Air Force One, through the White House Military Office. I remember a couple days later getting a bill for $9.18. The bill said for meals on September 11th between Sarasota-Barksdale, Barksdale-Offutt, Offutt-Washington.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: I\u2019ve never felt more fatigued. I can\u2019t remember anything as physical as that day. It just sucked everything out of you.\n\nMike Morell: The president\u2019s mil aide [Tom Gould] was looking out the window on the left side of the plane, he motioned me over. \u201cLook.\u201d There was a fighter jet on the wingtip. He told me there was another one on the other side of the plane. In the distance, you could see the still-burning Pentagon. Throughout the day, all this is happening and you don\u2019t really have the chance to feel the emotion. But that got me. Tears filled my eyes for the first time that day.\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: It was really a shock, but I remember thinking that the hole in the building, relative to the whole size of the Pentagon, is relatively small. It was symbolic. It\u2019s a painful wound, but we\u2019re big enough to absorb it.\n\nAndy Card : We kneeled on the benches to look outside, you could see the fighter jets came up pretty close to Air Force One. You just don\u2019t see that on Air Force One.\n\nKarl Rove: I watched the fighters and I realized this was no ceremonial escort\u2014this was the last line of defense in case there was a MANPAD [surface-to-air missile] on the approach to Washington. They were going to put themselves between Air Force One and whatever the threat was.\n\nCol. Dr. Richard Tubb: As we\u2019re coming in on final [approach], Dan Bartlett comes into my office and says, \u201cThanks, I took all those pills. Anything else I need?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?! Absolutely not! That was supposed to be a week\u2019s worth!\u201d I\u2019m flipping through the Physician\u2019s Desk Reference, that huge book, trying to figure out what the toxic level of Cipro is.\n\nBrian Montgomery: [Dan] was real worried for a moment. After all that happened that day, Dan was going to die from Cipro poisoning.\n\nCol. Dr. Richard Tubb: I looked into it and told him, \u201cListen, you\u2019re going to be fine. You might want to take an antacid.\u201d\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: It was a long day. As we\u2019re landing, I\u2019m thinking, all I\u2019ve got to do is get him on the ground, then I can hand him off to the Marines. I\u2019m watching the fighters scream by underneath, doing suppression, trying to figure out if there was anything waiting for us. The landing itself, after everything, was entirely normal.\n\nGeorge W. Bush meets with his National Security Council in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center of the White House after addressing the nation. | U.S. National Archives\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: We\u2019d landed right behind Air Force One, so we saluted as Marine One took off. We knew the president was heading to the White House.\n\nAri Fleischer: There are several different routes that Marine One can take back, we took the most scenic, directly over the Capitol, down the Mall, at the Washington Monument, you bank right.\n\nAndy Card: We only flew at tree-top level, zig-zagging, to make it harder for a missile to hit us. We were really low to the water on the Potomac.\n\nAri Fleischer: Out of the front left of the chopper, the president had a clear view of the Pentagon. The president said to nobody and everybody, \u201cThe mightiest building in the world is on fire. This is the face of war in the 21st century.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEpilogue\n\nMike Morell: [In 2011], the very first telephone call that President [Barack] Obama made after we were sure we\u2019d killed Osama bin Laden was to President [George W.] Bush. President Obama knew that I\u2019d been with him on 9/11, and so he asked me to fly down to Dallas after the raid to brief President Bush personally. I went down about two weeks later and walked President Bush through every aspect of the raid. I thought I could see in his face some sense of closure.\n\n(Note: All titles and military ranks are presented as people were on September 11, 2001, and interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.)", "description": "Where was the president in the eight hours after the Sept. 11 attacks?
