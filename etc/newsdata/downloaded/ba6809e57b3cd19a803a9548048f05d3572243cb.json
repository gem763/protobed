United\u2019s manager also believes a top-four finish is not beyond his side this season.\n\nZinedine Zidane is under pressure at the Bernab\u00e9u because of poor results, rather than his failure to sign his main transfer target in the summer, though Real Madrid\u2019s president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, still appears to believe a move is possible later in the season. However, Solskj\u00e6r is adamant Pogba will stay at United.\n\nMason Greenwood\u2019s first Manchester United goal earns win over Astana Read more\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t listen to the president of Real Madrid,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cI am not worried now and I will never be worried in the future about Paul staying here. If it all kicks off again in January, there will be no worries then either. If we have to live with the speculation again, then we will handle it like we did in the summer.\n\n\u201cPaul is going nowhere, he is working hard and is totally committed to Manchester United. He is one of our big characters, someone who will walk out on to any pitch and be full of confidence. That\u2019s what I look for in a United player. You need a big personality to play for this club.\u201d\n\nPogba has missed the last couple of United games through injury and may not recover in time to face West Ham on Sunday afternoon. Anthony Martial and Daniel James also face late checks for a fixture Manchester United lost 3-1 a year ago, at a time when Solskj\u00e6r was still managing Molde in Norway. \u201cI think Jos\u00e9 [Mourinho] was struggling for fit centre-backs at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI also remember that West Ham\u2019s first goal was offside and that kind of thing can affect an outcome.\n\n\u201cI think people can see our improvement as a team since. We feel we are on the right track and, if we keep it up, I believe we will be challenging for the top four at the end of the season. It is wide open at the moment.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United\u2019s manager, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, has said he is confident Paul Pogba will not leave Manchester United despite Real Madrid\u2019s continued interest", "authors": ["Paul Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e104ac402912ed222047ab2cc92fd7a60022e21e/0_168_3300_1981/master/3300.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=faaaae9043158e6e00dc52b9b3f9dcbf", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
