Eskom must do the following: Run its current plant and equipment better, achieve other operational efficiencies, including much better cash management and fast track the separation of the utility into three parts as endorsed by the political principals.\n\nRead: Mboweni says former ministers to blame for wage mess; ministers\u2019 perks curbed\n\n\u201cThere should be no doubt about the policy decisions in this regard,\u201d he said.\n\nMboweni said, for the power utility, any more financial support would be in the form of loans.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, new cash flow support will no longer be equity but will be in the form of loans. Once I am convinced that the Eskom board and management has made an irrevocable commitment to implement government\u2019s decisions and there is enough progress, we will negotiate the appropriate size of debt relief. Eskom is a business and should be run that way.\u201d\n\nAccording to treasury official, the effect of the decision will be that government will be a non-preferent creditor of Eskom.\n\nThe loans would be against the strength of the financial books of each of the envisaged units Eskom is split into.\n\nGovernment previously gave the power utility a R6 billion subordinated loan in 2008 but had to convert that it into equity in 2015.\n\nThe decision would not, according to treasury, allow Eskom to go loan shopping without the protection of a government guarantee which would expose the utility should it default.\n\nOn South African Airways (SAA), Mboweni said the airline\u2019s hopes of ever making enough money to sustain itself in its current configuration are non-existent.\n\n\u201cSAA is unlikely ever to generate sufficient cash flow to sustain operations in its current configuration. Which then begs the question: how long are we going to be on this flight path? Forever? I think not. Operational and governance interventions are required urgently. I am pleased to learn that there are conversations involving SAA and potential equity partners, which would liberate the fiscus from this SAA sword of Damocles,\u201d he said.\n\nMboweni said the national carrier might have to be sold off and the transaction would serve as a case study for future the state selling of assets.\n\n\u201cWe agreed that we are going to sell off some assets but we won\u2019t tell you which ones.\u201d\n\nMboweni said government had decided to retain the user pay principle on e-tolls and though there would be further dispensation and value-added services, compliance would also be strengthened.\n\n\u201cNot paying your tolls has already led to our roads deteriorating. We have been unable to maintain the network. I urge the nation to please pay your bills. We need to build a culture of payment as government services can only be sustainable if all of us that can pay for services do so,\u201d he said.", "description": "Finance minister Tito Mboweni has vowed not to handle troubled power utility Eskom with kid gloves and that, in future, the government would assume the role of creditor to the utility.", "authors": ["Lesetja Malope"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9493/73b2c5ed4ba94180bff649c6e3413498.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
