Some 16 per cent of drivers under the age of 24 thought it meant a restriction zone.\n\nMany drivers were not aware that the shape and colour of signs specifically indicated an order, warning and information\n\nHalf of the motorists quizzed said they would follow what other drivers were doing if they didn't understand what a road sign was instructing them. Some 5% would turn around and avoid the area completely\n\nDavid Carter, spokesman for Accident Advice Helpline, which commissioned the research, said: 'It was surprising to see how many drivers were unaware of the significance of the shape of a sign let alone its meaning.\n\n'It's worrying how many people don't know basic road signs when driving their vehicle.\n\n'Understanding road signs are vital to road safety and not knowing their meaning can result in accidents due to ignorance.'\n\nDrivers in the East Midland were most confident of their road-sign knowledge\n\nA worrying number of drivers said they completely ignore speed limit signs - easily one of the most common on UK roads\n\nSome of the incorrect interpretations could easily land drivers in hot water.\n\nA staggering 43 per cent misunderstood the sign for no motor vehicles, thinking it means cars and motorbikes only.\n\nAnd one quarter admit there are some signs they will actively ignore with more than one in ten disregarding speed limit signs.\n\nA further eight per cent confess to ignoring loading zones and six per cent disregarding parking restrictions - both of which could see them being handed expensive fines.\n\nNot knowing what a road sign means has, in some cases, caused accidents on the road, British drivers have admitted\n\nMen are more confident than women that they can remember all the signs in the Highway Code. Though the research didn't prove if this was the case\n\nAs well as risking penalties for not knowing what a sign is telling them, many are also putting themselves in danger.\n\nAccident Advice Helpline found that one in twenty have been involved in a road accident because they or another driver didn't understand a road sign. One in five said they had a near miss for the same reason.\n\nThe study also discovered that men were more confident identifying signs correctly, with 58 per cent claiming they knew the meaning behind each one. That compared to just 48 per cent of women.\n\nGeographically, drivers in the East Midlands said they remembered everything from their days of studying the Highway Code, with one third claiming they could recall all the road signs they had to learn compared to less than one fifth from Wales.\n\nThink you know your road signs?
