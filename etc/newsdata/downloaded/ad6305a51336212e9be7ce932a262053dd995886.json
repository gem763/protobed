She recalled the joy she felt after her film, replete with gauzy, golden-hour shots of the towers, was applauded. A New Yorker, she awoke the next day to news of the attacks and spent the next 48 hours camped in front of a TV, crying and contacting loved ones.\n\nHer movie had a second screening on Sept. 12, she said, and \u201cthe people who went basically reported back that there were audible gasps and sobs at those images.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just gut-wrenching,\u201d she added. \u201cAll these images that were meant to be beautiful and romantic were now harrowing and triggering in the midst of a rom-com that was intended to make you laugh, not traumatize you.\u201d\n\nMs. Westfeldt said she and her colleagues debated intensely about whether to leave in the Trade Center scenes and risk \u201cinflicting more pain on people,\u201d or remove them and possibly \u201cerase or misrepresent history.\u201d In the end, they chose to reshoot the scenes. She asks herself now whether the original scenes might have stood the test of time as the despair of losing the towers ebbed.\n\nMichael Nozik , producer of the 2002 movie \u201cPeople I Know,\u201d starring Al Pacino, felt the same way. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we were not seen as exploitative and insensitive at a time when there was so much grief,\u201d he said of the reshoot. Now, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to look at all the beautiful images of the Trade Center because it\u2019s more like honoring them than the horror of recalling that event.\u201d\n\nSome directors, though, do not support altering a pre-9/11 picture based on post-9/11 sensibilities. Among them is Michael Bay , the maker of \u201cArmageddon,\u201d a 1998 summer disaster flick that shows one of the towers ablaze after a meteor strike.", "description": "Some movie and TV executives excised the towers from pre-9/11 works.
