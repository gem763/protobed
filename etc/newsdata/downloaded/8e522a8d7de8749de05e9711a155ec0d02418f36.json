I just want to get on with my life.'\n\nMrs Ruffold, a stay-at-home mother, said: 'The wound is getting bigger by the day, it's rotting him away very gradually.\n\n'We need this surgery otherwise it will get worse, it'll allow him to start healing again.\n\n'He's in pain every day, he has to take cocktails of adult painkillers, they make him quite drowsy and not himself.

A pilonidal sinus is a small hole or tunnel in the skin at the top of the buttocks and base of the spine. It is most common in young adults, and rarely seen in children or people over 40. However, sitting all day is a risk factor, along with obesity, injury to the skin, frequent irritation of skin and family history. It's not clear what causes a pilonidal sinus, but it is believed to be ingrown hair or dirt collecting in the area. Pilonidal sinuses are more common in men because they tend to be hairier, the NHS says. It does not always cause symptoms and only needs to be treated if it becomes infected. The sinus is clearly infected when there is pain, swelling, and pus inside. It can be a long-term problem that keeps reoccurring. A 'chronic infection' is when the infection keeps returning and surgery is needed. Surgery may involve draining the pus from the abscess, or removing the infected tissue and leaving the wound open to heal. But if the wound is large and repeatedly infection, the sinus is removed and the skin either side is sewn together.\n\nHowever, Mrs Ruffold said this was an 'error', because Chae's health quickly deteriorated because the infected tissue was still there, leading him to be taken to A&E on two occasions.\n\nShe claims a paediatrician said Chae needed to be treated immediately, but he landed on a waiting list for an operation for seven months.\n\nSurgery may involve draining pus from the abscess or removing the surrounding infected tissue.\n\nThe wound is left open to heal in some cases, meaning Chae's was left with a gaping hole that Ms Ruffold claims a person's fist would easily have fitted in it.\n\nMonths later, in August 2018, the family received the crushing news that the sinus had returned. Chae needed another round of surgery six weeks later.\n\nNow, despite the best efforts of his parents and nurses, the sinus has returned again, meaning that Chae has to face a third surgery.\n\nHowever, the family are at war with the hospital to receive care from a different surgeon, leading them to turn to private care.\n\nMrs Ruffold revealed they have paid \u00a3800 for a special foam mattress for Chae because he's not eligible to have one on the NHS.\n\nHe has now been living with the open wound at the base of his spine for 18 months and is unable to sit.\n\nHe was already home-schooled, but is now unable to even leave his bed to eat a meal.\n\nChae had two operations on his sinus in summer 2018. But the sinus came back\n\nChae has now been living with the open wound at the base of his spine for 18 months and is unable to sit. He is waiting to have a third surgery\n\nMrs Ruffold said: 'It's been nothing short of a living nightmare. We haven't been able to sit around the table and eat for two years.\n\n'We can't go out, we can't do anything as a family, we haven't been able to go on holiday.\n\nThe family are trying to raise \u00a35,000 for Chae to have an operation that will remove the infected tissue and allow the wound to heal.\n\nMrs Ruffold said: 'There are days when Chae gets really down and frustrated. He can't get out of bed and can be in huge pain sometimes.\n\n'It can be very upsetting when he gets in a low mood because it's very hard for him to think positively.\n\n'He's a social butterfly and an outgoing boy. He should be out playing with his mates not lying in bed all day.\n\n'You have to keep your spirits up and stay positive and just keep upbeat.'\n\nChae's parents are raising \u00a35,000 on GoFundMe for his operation.", "description": "WARNING, GRAPHIC CONTENT: Chae Ruffold, 15, has had two failed operations to treat a pilonidal sinus - an infected hole in the back, believed to be due to an ingrown hair.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19534714-0-image-a-27_1570704561848.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
