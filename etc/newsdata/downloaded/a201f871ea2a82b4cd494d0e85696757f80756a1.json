That followed a related decision by the Trump administration to blacklist several Chinese companies on a blacklist.\n\nUncertainty around the U.S.-China conflict, including fears the scope of the dispute is expanding beyond trade issues, has served to underpin gold, a traditional haven asset, analysts said.\n\n\u201cA wider scope in this protracted conflict would only heighten the barriers to a meaningful reconciliation between the world\u2019s two economic powerhouses, while prolonging its drag on the global growth outlook,\u201d said Han Tan market analyst at FXTM, in a note. \u201cRisk aversion shall continue being the de facto mode for global investors, which should bode well for safe haven assets, keeping gold above $1,500.\u201d\n\nUncertainty also remains over the U.K.\u2019s plans to exit from the European Union amid increasingly strained relations between London and Brussels. The U.K. is scheduled to leave the EU on Oct. 31, while prospects for a deal that would govern the country\u2019s relationship with the block appeared to fade on Tuesday as London and Brussels traded insults over a stalemate in talks.\n\nIn other metals trade, January platinum PLF20, +0.45% rose 0.7% to $895.90 an ounce, while December palladium PAZ19, +0.68% gained 0.7% to $1,663 an ounce.\n\nDecember copper HGZ19, +0.10% was up 0.2% at $2.5725 a pound.", "description": "Gold edges higher Wednesday as investors parse developments in U.S.-China trade talks.", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GX379_goldpi_ZG_20181031073336.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
