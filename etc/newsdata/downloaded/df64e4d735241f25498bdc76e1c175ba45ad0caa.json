(Sept. 13) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Democratic National Committee plans to hold the October presidential debate over just one night, setting up a stage packed with 12 candidates for the first time this year.\n\n\u201cPending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday, Oct. 15,\u201d party officials wrote in an email Friday.\n\nCNN and The New York Times will be hosting the debate, which will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nThe following candidates will appear on stage together:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\n\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\n\nFormer HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii\n\nSen. Kamala Harris of California\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont\n\nTom Steyer, billionaire and activist\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\n\nAndrew Yang, entrepreneur\n\nOther candidates have until Oct. 1 to qualify, but it appears unlikely any others will meet the qualifications of receiving 2 percent support in four DNC-approved polls and donations from 130,000 unique donors.\n\nGabbard and Steyer are additions to this stage from the September debate, where only 10 candidates faced off.\n\nDespite Gabbard qualifying, she criticized the DNC over it\u2019s debate criteria Friday, saying that \u201cthere\u2019s been a lack of transparency in that whole process about which polls are selected, which aren\u2019t, which they\u2019re seeing as qualifying, which ones are actually polling.\u201d\n\nThe DNC recently released more difficult requirements candidates must meet to qualify for the November debates, setting up the possibility that several additional candidates may miss the stage compared to the upcoming October matchup, and potentially ending some campaigns.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/27/democratic-debate-who-made-october-debate-stage/3790609002/", "description": "Rep.
