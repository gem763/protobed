Both were previously identified as persons of interest in the case, according to the Associated Press, and are now in custody.\n\nSmith said McKinney's remains were found near the home where the two were arrested, as part of a search for the missing girl. The Associated Press reports that lawyers for both suspects have said their clients are innocent.\n\nMcKinney disappeared Saturday, October 12 during a birthday party. Police believe the last image of McKinney is from a video showing her outside an apartment complex with another toddler.\n\n\"It only takes a split second,\" Smith said. \"We can no longer assume that everyone is a part of the village that's trying to raise the child. We cannot take those things for granted.\"\n\nHow deep transcranial magnetic stimulation changed one woman's life\n\nMLB investigating Astros exec's foul-mouthed comments to female reporters\n\nMom accused of murder, lying about daughter's terminal illness", "description": "\"We found the remains of a child that we believe to be Kamille,\" said police chief Patrick Smith", "authors": ["Victoria Albert"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bvGDYw1uVtsxFyr7KQe46A--~B/aD02Mzg7dz05ODk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/c3b5ddf6a25ef8043fb0e4b9e454f4f1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
