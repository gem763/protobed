(AP) - Kyle Trask waited nearly seven years between starts, an unusual path that could have prompted the backup quarterback to leave Florida long ago.\n\nBut Trask stuck around despite a coaching change, the emergence of Feleipe Franks and the increasingly popular use of the transfer portal.\n\nNow, he\u2019s finally getting his shot.\n\nTrask will make his first collegiate start - and first since his freshman year in high school - when the ninth-ranked Gators (3-0, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) host Tennessee (1-2, 0-0) on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the best schools in the country, so I figured why leave when I have a top-10 education, friends I love dearly, a football team that\u2019s very supportive of me,\u201d Trask said Monday. \u201cAnd really I was just preparing every day as if I was the starter, as I should be.\n\n\u201cI took advantage of the opportunity I\u2019m given.\u201d\n\nTrask replaces Franks, who gruesomely dislocated and fractured his right ankle in a 29-21 victory at Kentucky last weekend. Franks will have surgery next Monday and be sidelined at least six months, coach Dan Mullen said.\n\nMullen said Trask and redshirt freshman Emory Jones will each get snaps against the Volunteers. Neither has seen much more than mop-up duty with the Gators.\n\nTrask\u2019s role was mostly the same in high school.\n\nTrask served as a backup at Manvel (Texas) High for three seasons. He completed 72% of his passes for 1,545 yards, with 16 touchdowns and no interceptions, over his final two years with the Mavericks.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t start in high school, but I definitely got a lot of reps,\u201d said Trask, a redshirt junior. \u201cI was around a lot of talent, and our coaches here have done a great job of preparing me for this moment.\u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 240-pound Trask was last a starter when he played for Manvel\u2019s Freshman A team in 2012.\n\nHe nearly ended his backup streak last year, though. Franks was benched in a 38-17 loss to Missouri in early November. Trask replaced him in the third quarter and completed 10 of 18 passes for 126 yards and a touchdown.\n\nTrask was expected to take over the job the following week against South Carolina. But he broke his left foot practicing a trick play three days before the game, essentially handing the job back to Franks.\n\nFranks played well down the stretch and entered this season as the unquestioned starter.\n\nTrask could have bailed after the season, or after spring practice or even after fall camp - but he insists he never even considered leaving.\n\nMullen even met with Trask in January, asking him two main questions: Do you want to be here? Do we need to help you go somewhere else?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the in thing in college football,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cIf I\u2019m not playing, how fast can I transfer? If I\u2019m not going to start, if I\u2019m not going to get this. Me, me, me, me, me. I, I, I, I, I. I have to do this. I have to be in the transfer portal.\u2019\n\n\u201cKyle\u2019s not that. He\u2019s a graduate from the University of Florida. He\u2019s going to get a master\u2019s degree from the University of Florida, sees the bigger picture in life, understands he\u2019s being developed really well here as a quarterback and was waiting for it. He loves the team, loves the program, has been working really, really hard and was ready for his opportunity when his number was called.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of a throwback, right?\u201d\n\nTrask has completed 13 of 18 passes for 166 yards, with a touchdown and no turnovers, this season.\n\nHe rallied the Gators from a 21-10 deficit in the final quarter at Kentucky, setting up one touchdown with a pitch to Lamical Perine and keeping the ball for another.\n\nHe\u2019ll be in a slightly different spotlight against Tennessee.\n\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s plenty capable,\u201d Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said. \u201cYou saw it the other night. Very efficient in what they did. They didn\u2019t really change much in who they are, the guy\u2019s plenty capable. He\u2019s a big, strong guy that\u2019s got a good arm, and he\u2019s physical in the run game.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Florida is preparing to play without CB CJ Henderson (ankle) and DE Jabari Zuniga (ankle) against Tennessee. \u2026 Pruitt said he hasn\u2019t decided yet whether CB Bryce Thompson will travel to Gainesville. Thompson, a starter last season, was arrested last month on a misdemeanor domestic assault charge. He returned to practice last week. \u2026 The Gators will be without elusive WR Kadarius Toney (shoulder) for the second straight week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyle Trask waited nearly seven years between starts, an unusual path that could have prompted the backup quarterback to leave Florida long ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/florida_kentucky_football_46398_c0-139-3331-2081_s1770x1032.jpg?9506eb8f2bef573d6a0b19caf34a8aee90f276a8", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
