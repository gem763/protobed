They're wary of the policies and electability of left-wing candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and they're concerned about the ability of Joe Biden to keep everything together and get across the finish line. Cue the flop sweat-fueled whispers, courtesy of the New York Times:\n\nNEW: Tis the season\n\n\n\n-Bloomberg & Hillary have told folks they'd run if they there was opening\n\n-Kerry has showed signs of regret, is worried about Biden\n\n-Sherrod is getting more calls urging him to reconsider\n\n-Holder still talking about it\n\n-And: Deval!https://t.co/aJZLw3RKOg \u2014 Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) October 22, 2019\n\n\n\nAdditional details:\n\nLeaders and activists in the party are wary that all their top contenders have major weaknesses and are urging other possible candidates to get in the race, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Tuesday. \u201cYou can imagine much stronger candidates,\u201d Democratic National Committee member Elaine Kamarck told The Washington Post...Both papers reported that party figures worry Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren could be considered too liberal in a general election, while Joe Biden\u2019s fundraising lag may prove to be an Achilles heel for the one-time clear front-runner. The troubled position of the Dems became apparent for many of the party leaders after last week\u2019s debate. \u201cSince the last debate, just anecdotally, I\u2019ve had five or six people ask me: \u2018Is there anybody else?\u2019 \u201d Democrat Leah Daughtry told the Times.\n\nIf Joe Biden absolutely collapsed, one could maybe envision another establishmentarian with high name recognition and strong fundraising capacity being rapidly recruited and parachuted into the primaries, but that scenario seems far-fetched. Hillary still has all of her awful baggage (plus additional conspiratorial nonsense), Bloomberg is a wealthy X-factor (but the base would likely revolt), and Michelle Obama doesn't seem to be interested at all. Plus, is Biden showing any signs of a pending implosion?\n\nNew CNN National Poll: Biden's lead in Democratic primary hits widest margin since April\n\n\n\nBiden 34%\n\nWarren 19%\n\nSanders 16%\n\nButtigieg 6%\n\nHarris 6%\n\nKlobuchar 3%\n\nORourke 3%\n\n\n\nPoll conducted October 17-20\n\n+/-5.8 pts among Democratic voters https://t.co/WRo0IcMmiD \u2014 Amanda Golden (@amandawgolden) October 23, 2019\n\n\n\nGranted, it's a relatively small sample size, and there's no such thing as a \"national\" primary, but still. A 15-point lead is nothing to sneeze at. Meanwhile, this is the sort of response may keep Democratic elders up at night, especially if it represents a sentiment shared widely by independent and swing voters:\n\nAn American voter expressed her displeasure with Bernie Sanders & Elizabeth Warren's plans.\n\n\n\n\"How college is going to be free.
