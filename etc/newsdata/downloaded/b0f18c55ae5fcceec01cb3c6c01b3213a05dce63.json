It also remains on the fence about fighting fake news, suggesting too much of a crackdown could amount to censorship.\n\nIt does however support data portability \u2014 where users could move their data from platform to platform \u2014 as well as government inquiries into advertising technology, and increased funding for Australian media companies among other proposals.\n\nAfter a period of 18 months under intense government scrutiny, Facebook has hit back.\n\nResponding to the Australian Consumer Competition Commission\u2019s (ACCC) final \u2018Digital Platforms Inquiry\u2019 report, Facebook did not mince words.\n\n\u201cThe Final Report\u2019s analysis does not rest on a sound evidence base. It draws unfounded conclusions based on a selective and incomplete view of the spaces in which we compete, including subscribing to outmoded distinctions between different advertising services,\u201d it said in its submission on the report.\n\n\u201cThere is no basis for the Australian Government to interfere in the commercial arrangements between large companies \u2026 and Facebook.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: The Australian government has dropped its big report into big tech \u2014 here\u2019s what it means for Google and Facebook\n\nWhile the ACCC didn\u2019t provide evidence of anti-competitive behaviour, it did warn that Facebook\u2019s size and influence threaten market competition and consumer privacy. Here\u2019s what Facebook thinks about the main new rules proposed by the ACCC.\n\nFacebook agrees that a code be formed to combat fake news online but it shouldn\u2019t enable censorship\n\nDespite struggling to contain the content that is shared on its platform, Facebook remains on the fence about the need for any code to stop the spread of disinformation online.\n\n\u201cThe Final Report does not contain an accurate or comprehensive evidence base suggesting that there is a public policy problem necessitating a regulator-enforced code as an effective solution at this stage,\u201d it said.\n\nWhile supporting the idea in principle, it said consultation is required to avoid \u201cpotential censorship implications\u201d.\n\nFacebook flatly refuses to notify the ACCC of any plans it has to acquire smaller companies\n\nOne of the key drivers with regards to the lack of competition is the fact large companies like Google and Facebook can simply buy out any threats to their dominance. Facebook for example already owns Instagram and WhatsApp. The ACCC, therefore, is interested in knowing of any future acquisitions ahead of time. Facebook does not agree.\n\n\u201cThis recommendation is not supported by evidence of any existing gap in, or problem with, Australia\u2019s merger laws or processes, that would necessitate such new measures.\u201d\n\nFacebook supports greater funding for Australian media\n\nFrom tax incentives designed to boost philanthropic support of media companies to providing grants for local journalism and providing stable funding to public broadcasters, Facebook supported all recommendations designed to help the media industry.\n\nIt also tried to boast that it was doing its bit on that front, with its recent program of funding for small media projects.\n\nREAD MORE: Australian media companies are now making exclusive content for Facebook, just weeks after they slammed the platform\n\nBut it wholly disputes that it wields any power over media companies\n\nOne of Facebook\u2019s main arguments is that there is no power imbalance between it and Australian media businesses.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to imagine that such influential companies require the assistance of the Australian Government to negotiate commercial terms with Facebook, especially in light of the lack of evidence or findings of unfair trading on our part,\u201d it said, arguing that the media has been undergoing a transformation since before the advent of Facebook in 2004.\n\nWhile that may be true, the social media behemoth also doubled down, disputing that the loss of referrals from Facebook to news sites would amount to a substantial drop in revenue.\n\nThe proposition that Facebook isn\u2019t a key driver of online traffic for media businesses is a stretch at best. So too is the following suggestion that media companies could mitigate traffic reductions by having \u201cusers accessing the website or app directly, or via a search engine\u201d.\n\nIf Facebook could be avoided altogether by media companies, then the ACCC\u2019s list of recommendations could have been far more succinct.\n\nFacebook agrees with a code of conduct and privacy reform in principle but doesn\u2019t support Australian proposals\n\nIn principle, Facebook says it believes in a code of conduct for platforms that spread news and the need to do more to protect user privacy. However, it takes issue with the path proposed by the ACCC, arguing that advertisers should be allowed to proactively target users.\n\nIt wants users to be empowered to move their information around\n\nData portability \u2014 the ability for users to move their own information from one platform to another \u2014 was a key ACCC recommendation to encourage competition. Facebook agrees, with one reservation.\n\n\u201cThere are privacy considerations that need to be addressed to ensure that portability mechanisms are safe and easy to use,\u201d it said.\n\nFacebook wants the government to go after advertising tech companies\n\nAfter 18 months of being scrutinised, Facebook thinks its time the government looked elsewhere and sees the ACCC recommendation that ad-tech companies be examined as just the ticket.\n\nWhile it may hope that serves as a distraction, the ACCC\u2019s recommendations have put the Australian government and Facebook on a collision course from which neither can divert.\n\nIt\u2019s now up to the former to figure out exactly how to get Facebook to toe the line.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
