Imports dropped 1.5%.\n\nExports to the U.S. dropped nearly 8% from a year earlier while imports from the U.S. declined 12%. The trade surplus with America fell 3.5% to 564.1 billion yen ($5.2 billion).\n\nThe trade deficit reflects the ongoing trade deficit with Asia as well as the increase in that with the U.S., said Harumi Taguchi, economist with HIS Markit.\n\n\u201cThe risks that exports will shrink drastically have subsided but it is expected that time will be needed before exports can recover considerably,\u201d said Taguchi.\n\nThe tariff war between the U.S. and China has taken a toll across the region, hurting manufacturers within extended supply chains.
