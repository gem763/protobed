And only after visiting with \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d poet and seeing Frost\u2019s land did D\u2019Amico decide to purchase his own.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in English with minors in philosophy and history at St. Thomas, D\u2019Amico, a Renaissance man of sorts who grew up Catholic, tried out a year of law school before deciding that it wasn\u2019t for him and enlisting in the Army for two years.\n\nD\u2019Amico returned to St. Thomas for a semester in 1956, where he worked to get his teacher certification, and he began teaching English - and later, Latin - at Luther Burbank Junior High School.\n\nD\u2019Amico said he loved teaching the seventh-grade, where students studied a textbook featuring Frost as the principal poet. Frost\u2019s material, with vivid imagery, proved relevant and engaging for students who lived in semi-rural areas and were familiar with various species of trees and flowers, livestock and other animals.\n\n\u201cThey were seeing images that (Frost mentioned) every day, like stands of trees in a pasture,\u201d D\u2019Amico said. His method of teaching - engaging students with their surroundings through poetry - began working, he said. C-students quickly transformed into B-students.\n\n\u201cI taught them how to shape poetry and how rhyme scheme is really as rhythmic as your heartbeat,\u201d D\u2019Amico said.\n\n\u201cPut your finger on your vein,\u201d he remembers advising them. \u201cDo you remember nursery rhymes that go with the rhythm of your veins as you feel your heart pump?\n\n\u201cI laugh about it now, but it\u2019s kind of an emotional story for me,\u201d D\u2019Amico said, his voice quivering.\n\nDuring his 42 years as an educator, D\u2019Amico spent school breaks during different seasons researching Frost and learning about his life, works and the various literary sites in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine. He spent two years building an itinerary to follow.\n\nAnd in 1958, D\u2019Amico set out on his Frost-themed journey, toting a clipboard with a list of things he\u2019d set out to see and photograph, like apple trees, grape vines and spider webs.\n\nFrost\u2019s world in New England - where much of his writing was set - was breathtaking, D\u2019Amico said.\n\n\u201cAfter driving through three New England states for that first summer of 1958, . everywhere I went was this gorgeous greenery and wildflower,\u201d said D\u2019Amico adding that he was inspired by \u201chow language can be enriched by a keen eye.\u201d\n\nAnd every day, D\u2019Amico gave himself an assignment.\n\n\u201cI would find one out of 10 things that I was looking for. It took me years to find a spider web the size I wanted to go with a poem that I wanted someone to hear,\u201d D\u2019Amico said.\n\nWith the many photos he took, D\u2019Amico created postcards and slides that he\u2019d show his students and display in exhibits - many of which would be shown at Frost\u2019s established museums.\n\nD\u2019Amico first met Frost on Aug. 14, 1958. That meeting, he said, is one of his fondest memories. And all these decades later, it\u2019s not unusual for D\u2019Amico to keep a photo of the two of them in his coat pocket.\n\n\u201cHe was relaxed with me as (he was with) an old friend,\u201d D\u2019Amico said, recalling Frost\u2019s curiosity and concern about the lack of recognition given to secondary school educators and his great appreciation for the Lone Star state.\n\n\u201cHe loved Texas. He almost became a summer resident here, but the temperature was too warm,\u201d D\u2019Amico said. \u201cHe loved San Antonio. He loved Hill Country, and as a result, he knew Texas well.\u201d\n\nUpon coming back to his home in Houston, D\u2019Amico decided he\u2019d do what the poet did: acquire acres of land, which would allow him to see water by a creek, to see trees that were centuries old, and to have a high-profile property that could be refined.\n\nNow, that land will be transferred to St. Thomas\u2018 recently announced Conroe campus - benefiting the nursing program will be both an ode to his mother, who always wanted to be a nurse, and those working within the industry today.\n\n\u201cMy personal experience with nurses in recent years convinces me, they deserve it,\u201d he said. And the memory of Frost and the things his work allowed D\u2019Amico to see live on.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to St. Thomas, the campus was only a year old, and here I am, at an inception of another,\u201d said D\u2019Amico, moved to tears. \u201cThis is a very great thrill of my life.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Houston Chronicle, http://www.houstonchronicle.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Vincent D'Amico read earlier this year that his alma mater, University of St. Thomas in Houston, planned to open a campus in nearby Conroe in 2020, the 89-year-old made a quick decision.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brittany Britto"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
