If a woman has had a straightforward birth they can start gentle exercise as soon as they feel up to it, according to NHS England. This could include walking, stretches, pelvic floor or tummy exercises. However the NHS recommends waiting until the six-week postnatal check up before starting harder things such as aerobics or running. The amount of time suggested to wait also depends on how often a woman worked out before welcoming their baby. Recovery time after a complicated delivery or caesarean will be longer and exercise might have to wait. After having a baby, new mothers may not be able to work out to the same level as before. The NHS explains that the lower back and core abdominal muscles may be weaker than they used to be. Ligaments and joints are also more supple and flexible for a while after birth, so there's an increased risk of injury if a person stretches or twists too much. A midwife, health visitor or GP will be able to give guidance about when to start exercising again.
