Locally it has nine of 43 universities as customers.\n\nThe company has had more than 2.4 million enrolments across 8900 courses and in 2018 it generated $1.8 million in revenue.\n\nOpenLearning's course platform and consulting services are its largest revenue drivers, with the business only making a small portion of revenue from its courses marketplace.\n\nMr Brimo said the business, while small, was well-suited to public life, having settled on its business model and gotten used to providing investors with quarterly updates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We've experimented with a range of business models over the years and we know our customers value the OpenLearning platform and are willing to pay for it on a software-as-a-service basis,\" he said.\n\n\"For us, I don't seen short-term and long-term objectives as being at odds. We will be clear on what our focus is \u2013 enabling education providers to move online. All the other aspects [of being public] will work itself out.\"\n\nInvestors stay on board\n\nThe company will most likely be priced at 20\u00a2 a share and it is targeting a market capitalisation of $25-30 million \u2013 slightly below the private market valuation of $33.5 million it achieved when the Malaysian companies bought in last year.\n\nAll of the company's existing investors, which also include tech entrepreneur Clive Mayhew, intend to stay on board through the float and not sell down.\n\nThe announcement of OpenLearning's listing comes as fellow education start-up Crimson announced a $US20 million ($29 million) capital raise last week, valuing the business that's run by 24-year-old Jamie Beaton at $US260 million.\n\nThe capital raised through OpenLearning's listing will go towards growing its customer base in Australia and Malaysia. Mr Brimo's goal over the next few years is to build the largest education technology business in the country.\n\n\"For us, Australia is our home market and it's responsible for the majority of revenue and still has so much untapped potential,\" he said.\n\n\"We haven't spread across all of Australia yet because we haven't had the marketing resources ... our short term focus is on growing further in existing markets.\"", "description": "Adam Brimo started MOOCs platform OpenLearning in Sydney in 2012, now he's listing it on the ASX with a high-powered board.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6215%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_341%2C$y_315/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f0994a6f62c840df52def4f83fd860bf9037c25a", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
