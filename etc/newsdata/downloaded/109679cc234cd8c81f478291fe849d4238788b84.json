The coins bore the inscription \u201cPeace, prosperity and friendship with all nations\u201d, above the leave date: 31 October 2019.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nThe cost of designing and producing commemorative coins was met by the Mint out of its own revenues, the Treasury said, and the costs of recycling would also be met by the Mint.\n\nThere was speculation that the thousands of coins minted so far could fetch a premium on the 50p cover price, possibly selling for as much as \u00a3800 each.\n\nHowever, Brexit coins bearing the October date \u201cwill now be recycled\u201d, the Treasury said.\n\nJavid\u2019s predecessor, Philip Hammond, had planned a limited edition of about 10,000 commemorative coins to be sold to collectors for \u00a310 each in time for the first deadline on 29 March.", "description": "Decision over special-edition coins by Royal Mint comes as departure from EU is delayed", "authors": ["Phillip Inman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98f730f211af415ec50ec48704141d74dbe2f97c/1_105_804_483/master/804.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6963e813ebece7b224c59ce36ca00310", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
