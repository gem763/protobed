But when it comes to actually being vulnerable in real life, many of us struggle to open up.\n\nContrary to what many folks were raised to believe, vulnerability is a measure of strength and courage, not weakness.\n\nBren\u00e9 Brown, famed vulnerability researcher and author, defines it as the \u201cemotional risk, exposure and uncertainty\u201d that \u201cfuel our daily lives.\u201d In a romantic relationship, that might mean saying \u201cI love you\u201d first, owning the mistakes you\u2019ve made, being the one to suggest couples therapy or having the courage to directly tell your partner what you need from them.\n\n\u201cVulnerability often involves exposing ourselves personally in a manner that could potentially lead to feelings of shame, embarrassment, self-criticism or other uncomfortable emotions,\u201d Lee Land, a psychologist in Fort Collins, Colorado, told HuffPost.\n\nRisky as it might feel, the rewards of vulnerability are plentiful. \u201cThrough emotional openness and vulnerability people can improve their connections in close relationships and develop true intimacy,\u201d Land said.\n\nWe asked relationship experts to explain why vulnerability can be daunting and how we can incorporate more of it in our lives anyway.\n\nWhy We Struggle With Vulnerability\n\nHiraman via Getty Images \"The pain of emotional disconnection can lead people to hide their authentic feelings in an effort to protect themselves,\u201d says psychologist Lee Land.\n\nIn our romantic relationships, we fear that if we were to honestly express our insecurities, needs, mistakes, fears and character flaws to our partner, they\u2019d change their mind about us. We\u2019d be ridiculed or deemed unlovable. They\u2019d judge us, misunderstand us or abandon us \u2014 all terrifying prospects.\n\n\u201cVulnerability involves sharing our innermost thoughts and feelings with others in ways that may lead to rejection,\u201d Land said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all experienced times in our lives when people respond to us in hurtful or disappointing ways. The pain of emotional disconnection can lead people to hide their authentic feelings in an effort to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nOften, a person\u2019s level of comfort with vulnerability ties back to how they were raised and other past experiences. If their parents or caregivers have modeled and encouraged this type of honest expression, a child has a better chance of being able to connect with others in a similar way, said Spencer Northey, a marriage and family therapist in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cBut if showing vulnerability at an early age meant you got hurt, it is more likely you will struggle around opening up,\u201d Northey said.\n\nHow To Be More Vulnerable\n\nPekic via Getty Images \u201cThe more you practice and see that you can do it, the more willing you\u2019ll be to continue to take the risk of vulnerability in love,\u201d marriage and family therapist Anna Osborn told Bustle.\n\nIf you struggle with vulnerability in your relationships, you\u2019re certainly not alone. We compiled expert-backed advice that might help you practice vulnerability not only in your romantic relationships but in other areas of your life, too.\n\nIdentify the people in your life who display vulnerability. Then learn from them.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the co-worker who wrote about her miscarriage on Instagram or the friend who was brave enough to ask for help dealing with his addiction issues. By surrounding yourself with vulnerable people, you might soak up some of their authenticity. Slowly, your guard begins to come down, too.\n\n\u201cNot only can it build comfort to spend time around people who are emotionally open and vulnerable, these types of relationships can often facilitate the kind of interpersonal safety that gives us permission to share more openly,\u201d Land said.\n\nEase into it.\n\nThose who find it difficult to be vulnerable with a romantic partner have often \u201cbeen burned before,\u201d marriage and family therapist Anna Osborn told Bustle. So you don\u2019t have to dive in headfirst. Dip your toe in by opening up in small ways until you get more comfortable sharing the bigger stuff.\n\n\u201cThe more you practice and see that you can do it, the more willing you\u2019ll be to continue to take the risk of vulnerability in love,\u201d Osborn said.\n\nTake the time to clarify your feelings and keep checking in with yourself.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in the habit of avoiding or suppressing difficult emotions, you may start to lose sight of how you actually feel. Journaling, meditation, working with a therapist or other similar practices can help you better understand yourself and deepen your emotional life, Land said.\n\n\u201cBy developing increased comfort with strong emotions, people can learn to share vulnerable feelings in ways that foster closeness and connection,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTherapy can provide an environment that allows people to experiment in a safe way with healthy emotional vulnerability,\u201d Land added.\n\nValidate your partner\u2019s feelings.\n\nRelationship conflicts arise when one partner musters the courage to reveal something vulnerable and the other partner then either gets defensive or immediately starts offering solutions instead of really listening, said Portland, Oregon-based relationship coach Jonathan Robert.\n\n\u201cOften this is jumping the gun and rushing past the emotionality of the hurt or fearful partner,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, validate. Then, solve. This can be confusing for the listener because they think they are helping when, in fact, they are hurting.\u201d\n\nTo validate your partner\u2019s feelings, you need to acknowledge their experience \u2015 even if you don\u2019t necessarily agree with their perspective.\n\nRobert offered these examples of validating statements: \u201cOh, I can totally see how you could interpret what I said in that way,\u201d \u201cIt must feel so scary/hurtful/surprising for you to experience that\u201d or simply, \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\n\nAfter the validation, you can gently introduce your point of view and start a conversation about how to address the issue. Try something like, \u201cI didn\u2019t intend for you to experience that but I can see how you did,\u201d or \u201cI want to understand how you feel so that we can work on a solution,\u201d Robert suggested.\n\nWhen figuring out how to bring up a concern with your partner, use a \u201csoft startup.\u201d\n\nWhen voicing a complaint in the relationship, many partners immediately resort to criticism: \u201cYou always come home late after work and now dinner is cold. You\u2019re so self-absorbed.\u201d But a better \u2014 and more vulnerable \u2014 approach is to reflect and then reframe that criticism as an expression of a need, rather than an attack on your partner\u2019s character.\n\nRenowned relationship researchers John and Julie Gottman came up with the \u201csoft startup\u201d technique that uses the set-up: \u201cI feel _____ about ____, and I need ____\u201d to broach such conversations.\n\n\u201cIn my work,\u201d Northey said, \u201cI have found that criticisms are almost always needs in disguise.\u201d\n\nSo in the example above, you might say: \u201cI feel lonely and disappointed about you getting home so late and I need you to make an effort to be home in time for dinner more often. When you can\u2019t make it in time, I need you to call me to let me know.\u201d\n\nAnd remember that people generally respond to displays of vulnerability in positive ways.\n\nThink back to a time someone opened up to you. Chances are, you were honored that they shared their story with you. Maybe you admired the courage it took to do that. Perhaps it made you feel more connected to them.", "description": "A fear of rejection keeps our guards up.
