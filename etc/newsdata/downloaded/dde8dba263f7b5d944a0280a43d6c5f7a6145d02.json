Constructing a majority for any one of the three main options \u2013 soft Brexit, hard Brexit or no Brexit \u2013 does not seem possible through conventional politics. That is why The Independent believes the nation will be driven towards a new referendum in the end.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This would not be a repeat of the 2016 vote, which offered a choice between one specified option, Remain, and one unspecified one, Leave.\n\nWe believe that the argument has changed. There are now MPs who want to leave the EU who argue that a second referendum is inevitable. Huw Merriman, a Conservative MP who is an aide to the chancellor, told BBC Sunday Politics South East at the weekend: \u201cThere is no majority for anything, which means we can either carry on in this vein or be realistic and say we\u2019re going to have to put this back to the people to make a decision. I\u2019d back Leave in that situation, and I don\u2019t like it at all, but I\u2019m just being realistic.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to be sure what the Labour Party\u2019s position on Brexit is at any given moment, but it does seem to be moving in that direction too. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s comments for the cameras often sound like someone trying to remember a complicated script that has been drafted by a committee of warring factions.\n\nToday, for example, he ended up saying on TV: \u201cWe will call for a general election and a referendum.\u201d This may have been a garbled version of the written statement issued in his name on Sunday night, in which he said: \u201cThis issue will have to go back to the people, whether through a general election or a public vote.\u201d\n\nThis will not satisfy Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, who criticised Mr Corbyn\u2019s policy on Sunday night, saying the party should have advocated a referendum on the government\u2019s exit deal, in which it would campaign for Remain.\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, tried to strike a new balance today, which seemed to shift Labour policy significantly towards a referendum, which he described on TV as \u201cinevitable\u201d.\n\nOne reason Mr Corbyn\u2019s inner court may be reluctant to advocate a referendum is that they would then be asked what the question would be and what would be Labour\u2019s preferred answer. Mr Corbyn suggested he would be consulting his party about this before its annual conference in September. He needs to move quicker than that, because then a new prime minister will be hurtling towards the Brexit deadline of the end of October.\n\nMr Corbyn has started to move in the right direction, but he needs to endorse a new referendum unequivocally and soon.", "description": "The winners of the European elections were the Remain alliance \u2013 which is what Chuka Umunna, of the new Change UK party, once tried to call the five parties committed to keeping Britain in the EU.
