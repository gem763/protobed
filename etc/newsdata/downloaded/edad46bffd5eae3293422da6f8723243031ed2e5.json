It\u2019s that the new law fails to offer gig workers one of the most important employment rights of all: the right to form a union. As important as minimum wage and overtime pay are, they are minimum protections that fall far short of ensuring that workers earn what they need; only a union and a collective bargaining agreement enable workers to demand and secure anything beyond these minimum standards. But even more important, a substantial body of economic research confirms that basic workplace protections are adequately enforced only when there\u2019s a union on the scene.\n\nResearchers find that overtime pay compliance is significantly higher for union workers, for example, that wage discrimination is lower in unionized companies and that unions increase compliance with occupational safety and health laws. This last effect can be seen most dramatically in the context of workplace deaths: Recent research shows that for every percentage-point increase in unionization in a state, there is a 2.8 percent decline in occupational fatalities.\n\nThe GOP attack on American unions could cost Democrats the 2020 election\n\nThe reasons for this are straightforward: First, unions ensure that workers who stand up for their rights aren\u2019t fired for doing so. Second, unions make sure that workers know what their rights are in the first place (many lack such knowledge). Third, unions can bring claims on behalf of members that are too small to be brought individually but that the union can aggregate into a single significant case. So, there is a serious risk that California\u2019s new law will give workers paper rights but not real ones.\n\nTo prevent that outcome, California ought to enact a law that grants gig workers the right to unionize and to collectively bargain with their employers. States don\u2019t ordinarily have the right to take that action. In general, under the National Labor Relations Act, only the federal government can extend union rights to private-sector workers. But ironically, the Trump administration created an opening for state-level action by opining in May in a case involving UberX and UberBlack drivers that those workers are not covered by the NLRA \u2014 that they don\u2019t fall within the law\u2019s ambit.\n\nUber drivers didn\u2019t lose a case under federal labor law. Rather, the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board \u2014 the administration official charged with enforcing the NLRA \u2014 made it clear that he will not, in any instance, enforce federal labor law on behalf of gig workers. By excising gig workers from the NLRA entirely, that decision leaves room for state action. There\u2019s a general principle that federal law in this area preempts state law, but if the gig workers aren\u2019t covered by the NLRA, that principle doesn\u2019t apply.\n\nThe new economics of Labor Day\n\nCalifornia could even devise a better set of union rights than what the outdated federal law provides \u2014 thereby making powerful unionization a realistic possibility. The federal rules give employers too many tools for subverting workers\u2019 preferences, while they give unions too few tools for organizing, especially among dispersed and fluid workforces (like Uber\u2019s). Under federal law, for example, employers can require workers to make their choice about unionization in a central workplace at a single time, under the coercive eye of their employer. Federal law also allows employers to demand that workers listen to a barrage of anti-union messages while, at the same time, barring non-employee union organizers from the workplace \u2014 physically or virtually.\n\nA state law, in contrast, could give unions a right to contact drivers through the same technology that allows Uber and Lyft to coordinate rides, while giving drivers the right to register their choices about unionization through whatever technologies are easiest for the drivers. And California could establish that collective bargaining would take place between the drivers\u2019 unions and all the relevant firms in the sector. This kind of \u201csectoral bargaining\u201d \u2014 common in Europe \u2014 also helps workers, because among other reasons, it ensures that unionized firms aren\u2019t put at a competitive disadvantage relative to nonunionized ones, because all firms in the sector would be covered by the same wages and working conditions. This in turn reduces, if not eliminates, each firm\u2019s incentive to union-bust, and therefore frees employees to organize the powerful unions they want and deserve.\n\nWith its new law, California has taken an important step toward improving the lives of gig workers.
