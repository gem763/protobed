We expect Qantas Car Insurance to be popular for same reason,' Mr Joyce said.\n\n'Insurance can be a grudge purchase but in the first year of having Qantas Car Insurance you could earn enough points to fly from Brisbane to Singapore or Sydney to Bali.'\n\nIn a survey of more than 700 of Qantas' frequent flyers, more than half said they only had their car serviced once or less a year, and a third didn't know how to check their own brakes.\n\nQantas CEO Alan Joyce (pictured) said that within a year of being on the new car insurance travellers could have worked up enough points to fly to Bali\n\nDr Darren Wishart, a Road Safety Expert said regular checks on cars were vital.\n\n'Road conditions in Australia can vary greatly, so simple things like checking the air pressure in your tyres is a small but critical step that can be done to help keep you safe on the road,' he said.\n\nThe airline currently has 13 million frequent flyer members.\n\nMr Joyce said Qantas's next plan will be to launch their own home insurance program next year.", "description": "The Australian airline's new scheme launched on Tuesday will give customers 20,000 points for signing up as well as 6,000 extra points every time members have their cars serviced.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/03/20309548-0-image-a-27_1572320463949.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
