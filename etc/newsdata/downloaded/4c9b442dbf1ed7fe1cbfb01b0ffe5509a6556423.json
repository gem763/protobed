(AP Photo/Paul Beaty)\n\nThe Chicago Cubs\u2019 season can\u2019t end soon enough. After falling three games back in the wild-card race, the team added insult to injury Sunday after Kris Bryant was injured after slipping on a base.\n\nThe injury occurred in the third inning. With one out, Bryant hit into a double play. As he was trying to beat out the throw at first, Bryant slid on a wet base and rolled his ankle.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt didn\u2019t look good.\n\nKris Bryant leaves the game after this awkward play at first pic.twitter.com/q3tAX0d3KR \u2014 Cubs Talk (@NBCSCubs) September 22, 2019\n\nBryant eventually had to be helped off the field. While he appeared to injure his right ankle, Cubs announcer Len Kasper pointed out Bryant has also been dealing with right knee pain recently.\n\nThe 27-year-old Bryant wasn\u2019t putting putting weight on his foot as he exited the field.\n\nVisible pain on Bryant\u2019s face as he\u2019s helped off the field.

Rizzo rolled his ankle while trying to field a bunt. The injury looked like it would keep Rizzo out for weeks, but Rizzo was able to miraculously return after just a few days.\n\nStory continues\n\nBryant likely won\u2019t be on that timeline. After Sunday\u2019s contest, the Cubs have only six games left. With the team already trailing the Milwaukee Brewers in the wild card by three games, the Cubs could be out of it even if Bryant puts himself on the Rizzo plan.\n\nWith the season on the line the past couple games, the Cubs have failed to get it done. Bryant\u2019s injury is just another sign that this just isn\u2019t their year.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
