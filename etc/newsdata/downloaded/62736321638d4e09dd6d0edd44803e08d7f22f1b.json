While the Microsoft report did not name Iran\u2019s targets, it found evidence that hackers had infiltrated email inboxes in at least four cases. But the four successful hacks tracked by Microsoft did not belong to a presidential campaign.\n\nTim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign\u2019s communications director, said in a statement that \u201cwe have no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted.\u201d", "description": "The news, according to two people with knowledge of the attacks, followed Microsoft\u2019s release of a report that said hackers had targeted a campaign.
