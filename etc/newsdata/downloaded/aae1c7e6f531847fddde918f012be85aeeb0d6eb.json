Vice President Biden was handling the Ukraine portfolio while his son had a financial interest in Ukraine, and that is enough of a conflict to merit an investigation. We all agree that the sitting president is responsible for protecting the integrity of American elections and generally keeping foreign interference in U.S. politics to a minimum. That\u2019s what Mr. Trump was doing on the Ukraine phone call. (For those of you who say such matters should be handled at lower levels of government, my experience in corporate America tells me nothing much gets done until the bosses talk and agree. I assume government is similar.)\n\nAll sides can also agree that Mr. Trump was serving his own re-election interests by asking Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden. But we also agree our political system allows that\u2014even encourages it\u2014so long as the president is also clearly pursuing the national interest. Before the Democratic primary, would it be good for the country to know more about Joe Biden\u2019s relationship with Ukraine? Democrats should appreciate finding out soon if there is anything of concern, because I assume they don\u2019t want to go into the general election with a candidate who has some surprises in his Ukrainian closet.\n\nWhat we all agree to be true about Joe and Hunter Biden is that they had the types of interactions with Ukraine that raise eyebrows and invite a closer look. We also all agree that protecting the integrity of American elections should be a top priority for a president.", "description": "", "authors": ["Scott Adams", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
