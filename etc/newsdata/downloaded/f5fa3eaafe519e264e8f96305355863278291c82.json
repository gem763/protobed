Pictured alongside Lucy Ellmann\u2019s Ducks, Newburyport, which bore a sticker highlighting its shortlisting, The Testaments instead boasted a sticker branding it the winner. \u201cDon\u2019t think you were supposed to use those stickers yet, lads...\u201d wrote Sperling.\n\nMatthew Sperling (@matt_sperling) Don\u2019t think you were supposed to use those stickers yet, lads... pic.twitter.com/cuiKJCV7AC\n\nThe Testaments is currently 2/1 to win at William Hill bookmakers, behind favourite Ducks, Newburyport at 7/4.

It seems that in this case a winner rather than shortlist sticker has been mistakenly applied.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson added that they had not yet identified which bookshop had been overeager with their Booker winner stickers. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that we don\u2019t yet know which shop it is. Once we do, we will ask them to remove the winner stickers to be replaced with shortlist stickers (though they may well have done so already),\u201d they said.\n\nIn 2008, Will Self was inadvertently revealed as winner of the Wodehouse prize for comic fiction in the Hay festival programme \u2013 the same day the shortlist for the prize was announced.", "description": "Organisers rush to clarify that judges have not yet decided beyond the shortlist after bookshop brands copies of The Testaments as the winner", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/559686a8daca4fb1bd6a6bdf755553fd1a5d0acb/0_167_5004_3002/master/5004.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2fc6e9c36c24ebe733864441692197ee", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
