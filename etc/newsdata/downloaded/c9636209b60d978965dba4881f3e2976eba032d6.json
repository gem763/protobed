The loan was syndicated to other banks including Standard Chartered, Citigroup, Barclays and Royal Bank of Canada, according to a SoftBank presentation in May.\n\nCutting Exposure In Recent Months\n\nGoldman has been looking to cut its exposure to the facility for the last few months, one of the people said to the media outlet. Goldman is offering the debt at prices slightly below par, and also sell the credit line in pieces as small as $50 million, according to Bloomberg's sources.\n\nIn May, Goldman already reduced its exposure by bringing on board additional lenders. Now, the firm is looking beyond the existing group, and at least one of the original 10 lenders isn't interested in boosting its exposure, one of the people said.\n\nSoftbank's Setback\n\nBad news has been plaguing SoftBank this week, from the stalled initial public offering of WeWork(one of its biggest bets) to doubts over the sale of its debt-laden Sprint. The cost to protect against nonpayment by SoftBank in the credit-default swaps market jumped on Wednesday, according to ICE Data Services.\n\nGoldman Sachs has deep ties to SoftBank, working with the company to raise a second Vision Fund and advising founder Masayoshi Son's businesses on several deals in recent years. SoftBank's first Vision Fund, which counts Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund as its largest investor, has backed firms including messaging software company Slack, ride-hailing giant Uber and office-sharing startup WeWork.", "description": "Goldman Sachs Group aims to offload a portion of its stake in a $3.1 billion credit line to SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund which\u00a0it helped arrange.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.finews.asia/images/news/2019/09/gs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
