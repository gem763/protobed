I have notified Capitol Hill police, who are investigating the situation and potential legal violations of those who posted and distributed the photos, and therefore will have no further comment on the digital materials.\"\n\nMs Hill said the allegations of her affair with Mr Kelly are \"absolutely false\" and part of a \"smear\" campaign that includes her former husband. The couple began divorce proceedings earlier this year.\n\n\"I am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties.\"\n\nRedState alleges that Ms Hill and her husband were engaged in a consensual relationship with a third person that the website says was a member of Ms Hill's campaign.\n\nMs Hill said: \"I am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain.\"\n\n\"Revenge porn\" laws in California make the distribution of intimate recorded material without consent a misdemeanour offence punishable up to six months in jail.\n\nMs Hill, the first openly bisexual member of Congress, entered office in 2019 after unseating longtime Los Angeles Republican Steve Knight in a 2018 election, flipping the only remaining Republican seat in Los Angeles County.\n\nThe House's code of conduct doesn't explicitly mention rules for relationships among House members and campaign staff but does not permit members pursuing sexual relationships with their employees.\n\nMs Hill has denied the allegations of an affair with Mr Kelly to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who named the freshman congresswoman a vice chairwoman of the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee, currently participating in the Congressional impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a September statement, Ms Hill announced her support to proceed with impeachment proceedings, saying that the \"threshold has been crossed by this president and those checks and balances are in jeopardy\".\n\nThe 32-year-old congresswoman, formerly a director of a nonprofit organisation providing services to homeless people in California, had campaigned on income equality, anti-discrimination efforts and affordable housing. She announced that she survived multiple sexual assaults amid efforts to facilitate frank conversations with young women about consent and legislation.\n\nMs Hill said: \"I, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid.\"\n\nRead more\n\nPentagon official set to testify in Trump impeachment probe\n\nTrump compares impeachment probe to 'lynching' in explosive rant\n\nHalf of US wants Trump impeached and removed from office, poll says\n\nTrump urges Republicans to 'get tougher' on impeachment inquiry\n\nTrump's actions worse than Nixon's, says Bush's former ethics lawyer", "description": "California Congresswoman Katie Hill, one of a group of newly-elected progressive Democrats, has denied allegations that she had a relationship with a member of her staff and is blaming Republican opponents for circulating nude photographs of her and another woman on the internet without her consent.Text", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Fgbqqaj5j9f0F_dbUFX3Qw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/f905b34dacf01406155a5421220a0e0e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
