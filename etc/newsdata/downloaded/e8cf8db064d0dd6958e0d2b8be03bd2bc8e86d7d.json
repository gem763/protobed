Morgan Asset Management.\n\n\"It's that combination this week of weakening economic data\n\nand rising political uncertainty that has caused some tricky\n\nperiods in markets.\"\n\nWall Street futures NQcv1 were up between 0.1-0.2%.\n\nThe dollar index measuring it against a basket of\n\ncurrencies was up 0.1% near a three-week high of 99.146, and on\n\ntrack for its best week in a month.\n\nBalancing worries over the ramifications of any possible\n\nimpeachment of Trump was an apparent easing of trade tensions\n\nbetween Washington and Beijing.\n\nChina's top diplomat said on Thursday that China was willing\n\nto buy more U.S. products and that trade talks would yield\n\nresults. Those comments fuelled the positive mood after Trump on\n\nWednesday praised the Chinese purchases, saying a trade deal\n\ncould come sooner than people thought.\n\nEuropean shares reacted well to those signals, also getting\n\na boost from moves in currency markets. London stocks\n\nadded 0.9%, buoyed by a weaker pound after a central bank\n\npolicymaker hinted at a cut in UK interest rates.\n\nThe euro EUR=EBS was pinned at its lowest level since May\n\n2017, further helping export-oriented European stocks.\n\nThe trade war has upset financial markets and disrupted\n\nglobal supply chains as the world's two largest economies heap\n\nhundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs on each other's\n\nproducts.\n\nSCEPTICISM ON MAJOR DEAL\n\nThe two sides are prepping for another round of trade talks\n\nscheduled for Oct. 10 and 11 in Washington, but investors voiced\n\nscepticism at prospects of a major breakthrough then.\n\n\"There is still a huge gulf,\" said Eoin Murray, head of\n\ninvestment at Hermes Investment Management, adding that\n\nprospects for a deal had receded from earlier in the year.\n\n\"Around April, May time, the main sticking point was the\n\nenforcement mechanism - but we have retreated miles from that at\n\nthis point.\"\n\nTech remains a sticking point, with reports on Thursday that\n\nthe United States is unlikely to allow American firms to supply\n\nChina's Huawei Technologies HWT.UL undermining hopes of a\n\nbroad bilateral deal. Underlining market sensitivity, European chipmakers Infineon\n\nand Siltronic both fell around 1.5%,\n\nmirroring losses for Asian chip-related shares Samsung\n\nElectronics and SK Hynix .\n\nMajor Huawei supplier Micron Technology had fallen 7%\n\nin after-hours trade after it forecast first-quarter profit\n\nbelow Wall Street targets.\n\n\"Technology is at the heart of the confrontations between\n\nthe U.S. and China,\" said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony\n\nFinancial Holdings.\n\nIn commodity markets, oil prices fell as concerns of slowing\n\nglobal demand growth and a faster-than-expected recovery in\n\nSaudi crude oil output eased worries over potential major supply\n\ndisruptions.\n\nBrent crude futures fell 27 cents, or 0.4%, to\n\n$62.47 a barrel.\n\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock\n\nmarkets, please click on: LIVE/", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Shares slip as U.S. political concerns temper trade optimism", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6208D_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
