I've loved being part of the show,\" he said.\n\nBayley, a gold medal-winning table tennis player, had been partnered with Strictly professional Janette Manrara.\n\nHe is the second contestant to pull out this year due to injury. Jamie Laing had to withdraw before the series launched after injuring his foot, and was replaced by Emmerdale actor Kelvin Fletcher.\n\nBayley said: \"I want to say a special thank you to Janette for believing in me, and giving me the confidence to believe in myself.\n\n\"The things we achieved, from our couple's choice dance, through to the lifts in our salsa, will stay with me forever. I've had the time of my life.\"\n\nBayley and Manrara had been in the competition for six weeks. Their best score from the judges came in week five, when they received 32 points for their contemporary dance to Lukas Graham's 7 Years.\n\nThe show's executive producer, Sarah James said: \"We are so sad that Will is unable to continue on the show. He will be greatly missed and we wish him a speedy recovery.\"\n\nManrara said: \"Absolutely devastated that Will and I will not be able to continue dancing. We made some incredible memories that I will never forget, and I am pleased to have shared them with such an inspirational person who I can now call a friend for life.\"\n\nStrictly Come Dancing has not yet made any announcement on any changes that will be made to this year's competition as a result of the mid-series withdrawal.\n\nWith nine couples left in the competition, a single vote-off each week would leave three pairs competing for the glitterball trophy on 14 December. The number of finalists has varied between three and four in recent years.\n\nStrictly's other withdrawals\n\nWithdrawals from Strictly have been very rare over its 17 series to date, with just a handful leaving the ballroom bonanza without being voted off:\n\nComedian Jimmy Tarbuck left the show during the programme's fourth series after being diagnosed with high blood pressure. \"I'm absolutely devastated,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe following year, model and actress Kelly Brook withdrew in order to spend more time with her family after the death of her father, Kenneth.\n\nOne year later, political journalist John Sergeant's simple steps won over many viewers but he decided to quit after fearing he might actually win the competition. \"That would be a joke too far,\" he said.\n\nOlympic athlete Jade Johnson said she was \"absolutely gutted\" after an injury suffered during a dress rehearsal forced her to withdraw during series seven.\n\nAnd singer Will Young left the show for \"personal reasons\" during series 14. He later told the Times Magazine it was \"for my own wellbeing\".\n\nEarlier this year, Made In Chelsea star Jamie Laing pulled out before the series started after injuring his foot in rehearsals.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
