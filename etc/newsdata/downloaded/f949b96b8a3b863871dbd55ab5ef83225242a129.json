The domestic economy \u201ccould experience fits and starts for the rest of the year, and into 2020,\u201d the MAS said.\n\nMAS Macroeconomic Review Forecasts\n\nMAS Managing Director Ravi Menon said in an interview last week that the current cycle should bottom out toward the end of 2019 as the downturn appears to be confined to the trade and manufacturing sectors. The central bank elaborated on that view in its report on Wednesday, showing inflation will remain subdued while the labor market will soften.\n\nThe MAS, which uses the exchange rate as its main tool, eased policy in October for the first time since 2016. The move was a \u201cmeasured adjustment\u201d given that economic growth, business costs and consumer prices are expected to stabilize rather than decelerate further, the MAS said in its report.\n\nA \u201cmore aggressive easing of policy is unwarranted at this juncture,\u201d it said, although risks to growth and inflation are tilted to the downside. The MAS reiterated it\u2019s prepared to adjust policy if the outlook weakens significantly.\n\nThe services industry remains resilient for now and will continue to be a key support for growth, the central bank said. The outlook for the trade sector is \u201cuncertain,\u201d with prospects also depending on a recovery in the global electronics cycle.\n\nSingapore\u2019s labor market has weakened and wage growth will likely slow into next year, the central bank said. The latest data show retrenchments are on the rise, companies are cautious about raising wages, and unemployed people are taking more time to find new work.\n\n\u201cHiring sentiment has become more restrained amid the economic slowdown,\u201d according to the report. \u201cLooking ahead, domestic wage growth should ease as the labor market softens, even while sluggish demand could limit the pass-through of cost increases to consumers.\u201d", "description": "Singapore Central Bank Sees Economy Undergoing \u2018Fits and Starts\u2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb433ccb8ddd3b6e7d2ffeee71871f3e1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
