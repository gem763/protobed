We were under the impression that west to east trade would be unfettered.\n\n\"What we are now starting to see and hear is causing great concern.\"\n\nHe added: \"It looks like it would add a lot of cost, bureaucracy, and delay, and that would be immensely unwelcome.\"\n\nBritish business is not ready for new checks, industry leaders warn\n\nPaul Bastidon, Head of Global and European Policy at the Freight Transport Association, told Business Insider that the cost of new checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain wasn't the only problem for UK business.\n\nShe warned that many companies, particularly small businesses, don't have the capacity to carry out the new checks.\n\n\"These new obligations would come at a substantial cost to industry (\u00a37.5 billion for completing customs declarations alone for the whole of the UK according to HMRC), but the key question is one of feasibility, in light of the shortage of customs brokers highlighted by the National Audit Office in a recent report,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nThe government's impact assessment says small businesses could hire third-party customs brokers to complete customs declarations for them. However, the there is currently a shortage of customs brokers in the UK, according to a National Audit Office report published this month.\n\n\"The Government will need to address these structural issues of customs brokers and veterinarian shortages identified in the NAO report in consultation with industry,\" Bastidon said.\n\n\"Without it, many companies, not least small and medium sized businesses, would be unable to comply with new obligations.\"\n\nRead more: Surge in campaign donations from US poultry lobby as Trump pushes for Brexit trade deal with UK\n\nNaomi Smith, CEO of pro-EU group Best For Britain said: \"The government is trying to be all things to all men.\n\n\"They want to pretend there's no border along the Irish Sea, because that would admit that their Brexit deal would split the United Kingdom.\"\n\n\"But businesses are now seeing through the deception. They know this deal will add cumbersome paperwork, stifle trade and ultimately see jobs leaving the country.\n\nShe added: \"That threatens our prosperity in the short and long term, and shows why so many people are sceptical of this damaging deal.\n\n\"With so many businesses, politicians and communities worried about the implications of this deal, it seems only right that the public are given the final say on Brexit.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, that props up Johnson's Conservative government, is set to vote against Johnson's deal on the grounds that it would create trade barriers between the province and Great Britain.\n\nThe prime minister's plan to take the UK out of the EU with his deal on October 31 could be derailed on Tuesday evening if members of Parliament vote against the government's controversial programme motion.\n\nIf passed, the motion would force Parliament to hold 12-hour sessions and sit at the weekend in order to pass all necessary Brexit legislation before the Halloween Brexit deadline next week.\n\nHowever, opposition MPs and some Conservatives are set to oppose the motion, on the grounds that they should have more time to scrutinise details of Johnson's deal, revealed in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB.)", "description": "The Brexit deal would result in new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9502/ee5c9c8c75004b62a12303ce5d178737.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
