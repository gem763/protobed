(AP) - A mosquito species native to tropical climates and known to carry the Zika virus has been found in Nebraska.\n\nState health officials said Tuesday in a news release that the Aedes aegypti mosquito was recently found in southeastern Nebraska\u2019s York County. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services says it\u2019s the first time that type of mosquito has been found in Nebraska.\n\nHealth officials say the Aedes aegypti bites primarily in the daytime, only feeds on people, and can only fly about 500 feet. Besides Zika, it\u2019s been known to spread yellow fever, chikungunya and dengue.\n\nState epidemiologist Dr. Tom Safranek says the spread of such diseases would require an infected person to be bitten by the mosquito that would then have to bite an uninfected person, making the risk of such infections in Nebraska low.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A mosquito species native to tropical climates and known to carry the Zika virus has been found in Nebraska.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
