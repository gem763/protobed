In 2016, when those 17 GOP-ers were having their debates, I cared very much \u2014 intensely. This time around, as the Dems are debating? No. It is so relaxing, frankly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo a Democrat, I\u2019m sure, the 17 GOP-ers in 2016 seemed alike, pretty much. The same with Dems to me today.\n\n\u2022 Against his rivals for the Democratic nomination, Joe Biden will never win a woke-off. They will out-woke him every day. He might as well aim for the sensible middle, or the Democratic version of it. Would that be enough to win the nomination? I don\u2019t know. But I suspect that would be his best shot.\n\n(Not that any Democrat ever sought or took advice from me.) (Not many Republicans have either, trust me.)\n\n\u2022 Last week, Marianne Williamson, an unconventional candidate, was said to have scored big in her debate. Maybe so \u2014 but I had a memory of 2016. Carly Fiorina, one of the GOP contenders, scored very, very big in her debates. People were buzzing. But this did not translate into votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe electorate can be a mysterious beast.\n\n\u2022 Like you, perhaps, I have been reading about suburban women. This article, for example: \u201cSuburban women recoil as Trump dives into racial politics.\u201d\n\nYears ago, James Carville, the colorful Clintonista, made a famous crack \u2014 something like, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in reincarnation, but if I did, I would like to come back as the bond market. People say it determines everything.\u201d\n\nMaybe one would like to come back as suburban women.\n\n\u2022 The North Korean dictatorship has been testing its missiles again. The following is an exchange between a reporter and President Trump on July 26:\n\nReporter: \u201cAre you okay with North Korea firing off these short-range missiles?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump: \u201cWell, you said it: They\u2019re short-range missiles. And my relationship is very good with Chairman Kim. And we\u2019ll see what happens. But they are short-range missiles, and many people have those missiles.\u201d\n\nReporter: \u201cYou don\u2019t sound too spun up about it.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cNope. Not at all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReporter: \u201cThey\u2019re describing those short-range [tests] as a warning, and \u2018short-range\u2019 is short-range for the United States but not short-range for our allies, right? South Korea, Japan.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cWell, he didn\u2019t say \u2014 he didn\u2019t say a warning to the United States, I can tell you that. He didn\u2019t say a warning to the United States. But they have their disputes. The two of them have their disputes. They\u2019ve had them for a long time. But he didn\u2019t say that. But they are short-range missiles and very standard missiles.\u201d\n\nConservatives have pointed out something for a long, long time: It can be downright dangerous to be an ally of the United States.\n\nIn Foreign Policy magazine, Elias Groll had an article that began,\n\nIn recent weeks, North Korea has been testing a short-range missile that U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed as \u201cvery standard.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s anything but: The new missile represents an important advance in North Korea\u2019s ability to deliver a nuclear weapon and evade American missile defenses, according to experts. Defense analysts warn that the KN-23, a short-range, solid-fuel missile that is highly mobile and elusive because it is launched from a truck, appears to mimic a Russian-built missile that represents one of Moscow\u2019s most advanced rockets and could potentially penetrate the most sophisticated U.S. defense systems.\n\nI am not an expert in this field \u2014 but I would say: Take heed. Don\u2019t be na\u00efve.\n\n\u2022 On Twitter, Trump wrote, \u201cChariman Kim has a great and beautiful vision for his country, and only the United States, with me as President, can make that vision come true. He will do the right thing because he is far too smart not to, and he does not want to disappoint his friend, President Trump!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome days, you think that the American people elected a Communist as president.\n\nKim Jong-un\u2019s vision for North Korea is not \u201cgreat and beautiful\u201d \u2014 it is horrific and ugly. It is the continuation of a gulag regime, a \u201cpsychotic state,\u201d as Jeane Kirkpatrick called it, ruled with an iron fist by one family.\n\nI wish the United States had a leader who would say a word \u2014 one word \u2014 for the North Korean people, who have suffered persecution that most of us can hardly imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Then there is Hong Kong \u2014 President Trump and Hong Kong. In his remarks, Trump seems more sympathetic to Xi Jinping and the Communist dictatorship than he does to the democracy activists in the streets \u2014 all of whom are putting their necks on the line, and many of whom have been beaten to a pulp. I wrote about this on Friday, here.\n\nMy piece was circulated on Twitter, with the question, \u201cWhat should be the American position on the democracy protesters in Hong Kong?\u201d A popular response was, \u201cNone of our business.\u201d I checked the bios of these responders \u2014 and a startling number advertise themselves as Christ-followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuh.\n\n\u2022 Typically, Bret Stephens had an excellent column, here. This one is on higher education. One line stood out to me \u2014 an inspired and true line: \u201cUnlike the campus rebels of the \u201960s, today\u2019s student activists don\u2019t want more freedom to act, speak, and think as they please. Usually they want less.\u201d\n\n\u2022 An author, Yuval Noah Harari, had a problem: In order to have his book translated into Russian, he had to submit to Russian censorship. He did it \u2014 arguing (rationalizing?) that the censorship did no harm to the central ideas of the book, and that it was better to have a censored book in Russian than no Russian edition at all.\n\nTo read an article about this, go here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat would you do in such a situation (whatever the dictatorship was)? Would you say, \u201cNo way, jackasses, you\u2019ll have my book as I wrote it or not at all\u201d? You might like to think so. But . . . would you?\n\nAn interesting question, one that few of us will ever face.\n\n\u2022 Senator Josh Hawley (R., Mo.), a darling of the nationalist Right, is on the warpath against technology companies. He tweeted, \u201cSocial media \u2018innovation\u2019? What innovation? Big Tech doesn\u2019t deliver for the American people, and that\u2019s the biggest problem of all.\u201d\n\nA lot of people like their smartphones, their Facebook accounts, and so on. But leave that aside. I say, as a conservative: When politicians tell you that certain businesses have not \u201cdelivered\u201d for \u201cthe people\u201d \u2014 watch out. There is a long, unhappy history of this kind of thing.\n\n\u2022 I got a letter from a young friend of mine, a college student. He had read something I wrote (here). He said that my last paragraph reminded him of a passage from John Stuart Mill. Did I have it in mind?\n\nFirst, this was my last paragraph (a portion of):\n\nThe truth is, liberal democracy is something rare under the sun. People enjoy it only in parentheses, very brief. But it\u2019s worth struggling to hang on to. And if people lose it in one age or place, it will be waiting for people in another. You can\u2019t kill off these ideas. You can smother them for a while \u2014 even a good long time \u2014 but kill them, no. They will revive.\n\nDid I have Mill in mind? No, but I should have, and I will in the future. Here is the Mill my young friend thought of:\n\nThe real advantage which truth has consists in this, that when an opinion is true, it may be extinguished once, twice, or many times, but in the course of ages there will generally be found persons to rediscover it, until some one of its reappearances falls on a time when from favorable circumstances it escapes persecution until it has made such head as to withstand all subsequent attempts to suppress it.\n\n\u2022 Care for some music? Well, in this form \u2014 the latest episode of my podcast Music for a While. Some interesting stuff in there, I think. Certainly some good music.\n\n\u2022 A little language? You have heard of a love triangle (maybe even been involved in one). My cousin spoke of a situation at her workplace \u2014 a love square (involving four).\n\n\u2022 John Noonan, a defense expert, issued this report on Twitter: \u201cOverheard in Senate: \u2018Just because Kim Kardashian wants something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good idea.\u2019\u201d\n\nWise \u2014 you could put it in Bartlett\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 In a London club, someone pointed to a painting on the wall. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d she asked. We discovered she was an actress, who had sat for this portrait in the late 1910s. \u201cCould it really have been a hundred years ago?\u201d someone said. \u201cShe seems so contemporary. Not so far away.\u201d\n\n\u201cA hundred years ago isn\u2019t what it used to be,\u201d I said.\n\nTo a 15-year-old, a hundred years ago seems like ancient history. To an older person, a 90-year-old, say? Not so much . . .\n\n\u2022 Let\u2019s end on this subject of age. A new season of University Challenge, the British quiz show (my favorite show on television), has begun. It has been going since 1962. The quizmaster, Jeremy Paxman, said, \u201cFor the first time, we\u2019ve seen applicants whose year of birth begins with the number 2. And so they\u2019ve never known a world without Harry Potter, Google, or the emoji.\u201d\n\nHave a good week, dear friends. I\u2019m off to Salzburg \u2014 to the festival there, to do some work. One year, as I was going, Bill Buckley said, \u201cSay hello to music for me!\u201d", "description": "On politics, North Korea, the campus, \u2018Big Tech,\u2019 and more.", "authors": ["Jay Nordlinger", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jonah Goldberg", "David French", "Matthew Continetti", "Brian Stewart", "Jack Crowe", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kyle Smith", "Read More"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dem-debate-detroit-106.jpg?fit=1200%2C700&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-08-05"}
