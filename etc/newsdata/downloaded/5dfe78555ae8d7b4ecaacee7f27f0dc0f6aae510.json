He or she can then alert the referee.\n\nUsing this tactic solely to spot racism is rare in football. FARE do not send observers to domestic league fixtures and base monitoring international matches on whether they think it represents a high risk of racism. One senior Premier League insider said on Wednesday police forces in England use undercover officers, though primarily to track known troublemakers who are banned but travel to away games.\n\nEngland's players, who also face the Czech Republic on Friday, walking off the pitch in a united stand against racism would go against UEFA's three-step protocol.\n\nIf racist abuse is heard by the referee or reported by a player, then he will request a public announcement over the tannoy system demanding it stop.\n\nTammy Abraham has said England's players would be willing to walk off the pitch in Sofia\n\nIf this fails, then a suspension of play will follow, with both sets of players led off the pitch and a further warning played over the tannoy. If the chants continue, the match can then be abandoned.\n\nConcerns about further abuse comes after black England players were racially abused in their 5-1 win over Montenegro in March. They completed the game, though Raheem Sterling responded to taunts from home fans by pulling on his ears during a goal celebration.\n\nEngland's trip to Bulgaria coincides with FARE's 'Action Week'. The anti-racism organisation are using this international break to celebrate diversity and campaign against discrimination.\n\nOn Monday, 5,000 seats inside the 46,340 Stadion Vasil Levski will be left empty as part of the Bulgarian FA's punishment for racist behaviour. A banner displaying the message '#EqualGame' will be displayed in the closed section.", "description": "Specialist spotters will be deployed for England's Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria to sit among the supporters and report any racist abuse directed towards Gareth Southgate's players.", "authors": ["Kieran Gill For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/00/19516298-0-image-a-24_1570662621974.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
