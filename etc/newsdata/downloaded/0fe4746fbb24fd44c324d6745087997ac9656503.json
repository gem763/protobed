We\u2019re sad he\u2019s leaving, but excited for the contributions he will make to the global giant panda population,\u201d he said. \u201cBei Bei is an ambassador for conservation and part of a 47-year program that proves bringing species and habitats back from the brink is possible through global cooperation.\u201d\n\nThe zoo will host \u201cBye Bye Bei Bei\u201d events from Nov. 11-18 before the giant panda boards a plane and is flown to Chengdu, where he will be prepped to be included in the breeding program when he sexually matures, around 5 to 7 years old.\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature lists giant pandas as \u201cvulnerable\u201d and estimates only 1,800 are left in the wild.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
