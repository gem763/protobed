Fed officials who have cut interest rates at their past two meetings are debating when to stop easing policy, according to minutes of the past meeting released last week.\n\n\u201cThe FOMC may choose to provide additional accommodation going forward, but decisions will be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestors expect the Federal Open Market Committee to lower rates by another quarter percentage point at its upcoming Oct. 29-30 meeting, though Chairman Jerome Powell hasn\u2019t given a firm signal that it will act.\n\nBullard, who has been among the most dovish participants on the FOMC, dissented from the quarter-point cut in September, favoring a larger half-point move. The St. Louis Fed chief has argued for several years that persistently lower growth has moved interest rates into a new low-inflation regime where low rates are appropriate.\n\nThe U.S. economy grew at a 2.5% rate last year, but is slowing this year and risks a sharp slowdown, the St. Louis Fed official said. Risks include slowing global growth, uncertainty over trade policy, contraction in U.S. and global manufacturing, and slowing business investment, Bullard said.\n\nIn addition, a recent inversion in the Treasury yield curve -- meaning short-term rates are higher than long-term rates -- is a warning signal for a slowdown or recession, \u201cwhich seems to suggest U.S. monetary policy may be too restrictive for the current environment,\u201d he said.\n\nBullard said he was particularly concerned about inflation and inflation expectations running too low, adding a principal goal of \u201cinsurance rate cuts\u201d is to \u201chelp re-center inflation and inflation expectations at the 2% target sooner than otherwise.\u201d\n\nPowell said last week the U.S. economy was in \u201ca good place,\u2019\u2019 though the 10-year-old expansion faces continuing risks from businesses hesitant to invest amid a slowing global economy and turmoil over trade policy.", "description": "Fed\u2019s Bullard Warns of Too-Low Inflation and Risk of Slowdown", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic40c4866d8f1206cb84ad64b647fe007c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
