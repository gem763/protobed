Landscapers dug holes. Crews removed port-a-loos. All amid an air quality index measured unhealthy, with officials warning locals to stay inside.\n\n\u201cWe still need to make money,\u201d said landscaper Jordan Stokles, taking off his hat and wiping sweat from his brow.\n\nIn disasters like the wildfires scorching northern and southern California, choking the air with smoke and ash, day laborers and domestic workers have always been disproportionately affected.\n\nWildfire wedding: couple wear protective masks in viral California photo Read more\n\nIn northern California, more than 185,000 people were ordered to evacuate their homes and work sites over the weekend as the Kincade fire raged across the wine country hills. While many in the region were able to heed the warnings, many workers stayed behind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an agricultural community and everything is very time-sensitive when it comes to harvesting the crops,\u201d said Ariel Kelly, the chief executive of Coraz\u00f3n Healdsburg. \u201cWe have those visa workers on temporary agricultural visas and they\u2019ll be concluding their stay because this is the end of the season. There\u2019s this concern that \u2018if I don\u2019t finish the job, I won\u2019t get paid\u2019\u2026I know that after the first wave of evacuations happened last Wednesday night and a number of them were at our shelter, they were still leaving to go back to work.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vineyard workers watch the Kincade fire burning in the hills above Geyserville, California, 24 October 2019.

Not working means not having money for medication for a chronic illness. Not working means not having money for food.\u201d\n\nIn the Coffey Park neighborhood of Santa Rosa, several construction crews were at work on Tuesday, many of them rebuilding homes that burned down during the 2017 Tubbs fire that leveled the neighborhood.\n\nJosh Strand was cruising the neighborhood, which he said had been \u201ctechnically\u201d evacuated in totality. He was emptying the portable toilets on construction sites along street. The air was thick with the smell of fire, but Strand said he wasn\u2019t too worried. \u201cTwo years ago it was worse. I had to wear a mask. It\u2019s not so bad this time.\u201d\n\nAdvocates in southern California have similarly warned that workers are left exposed as wildfires rage in and near Los Angeles. \u201cI\u2019m hearing stories from Los Angeles where the owner just forgot to tell the worker not to come into work that day,\u201d said Lucas Zucker, the policy and communications director for the Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy. \u201cYou have safety exposures for workers where they may have less access to information about what\u2019s going on and the risk they\u2019re under, or they may be compelled to stay, whether it be their own economic necessity or their employer asking them to stay.\u201d\n\nComplicating many workers\u2019 decision of whether to show up for work is their legal status in the country. They\u2019re not eligible for federal aid if they are affected by the disaster, or unemployment. Nor do they necessarily trust they can bring any complaints to the correct authorities without putting their immigration status at risk. And for many, language barriers prevent them from getting accurate or trustworthy information.\n\nIn the Sonoma county wine region, there are more than 38,000 undocumented people, said Christy Lubin of the Graton Day Labor Center.\n\nDuring the 2017 fires, undocumented residents, fearful of the authorities, fled toward the coast instead of to evacuation centers with services, forming an encampment of 1,200 at Bodega Bay, Lubin said.\n\n\u201cYou see the national guard, you see increased law enforcement presence, and it\u2019s always scary,\u201d she said.\n\nThe UndocuFund, a fund that provides relief for undocumented residents affected by wildfires, has been reopened by immigrant service providers and advocates for the county.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Ortiz\u2019s organization is tracking instances of workers continuing to work in impacted areas and assessing how to aid those in need. She already knows of one instance of a house cleaner in respiratory distress.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fire burns near Getty Center in Los Angeles on 28 October 2019. Photograph: Qian Weizhong/Barcroft Media\n\nLast year during the Woolsey fire, which charred up nearly 97,000 acres and killed three, Ortiz\u2019s organization collected stories from more than 500 workers about having to work through the wildfire.\n\n\u201cThe stories we heard last year were workers being given hoses and being asked, \u2018Hey, keep the fire away\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cFamilies evacuating and saying, \u2018Hey can you stay and watch my dogs?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe says her organization is still struggling with the after-effects from the Woolsey fire. In the aftermath of the destruction, everyone looked at the decimated mansions without comprehending the loss of jobs that came with it.\n\n\u201cThe homeowners have insurance and are able to rebuild or move to a different place,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cThe worker has essentially nothing. With domestic workers, we saw people in really desperate situations, just people completely unemployed in a moment\u2019s notice, with no unemployment benefits and no access to any government aid.\u201d\n\nWhile day laborers and domestic workers will always experience a disproportionate impact in a disaster, Ortiz pointed out that the reason for this is that they are disproportionately affected by circumstances every day.\n\n\u201cThe situation that day laborers and domestic workers find themselves in is a climate-accelerated disaster because there is already a crisis that is happening,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when there\u2019s not a wildfire, it\u2019s the same sad thing. It\u2019s just exacerbated by these horrible climate situations.\u201d\n\n", "description": "For laborers and domestic workers, a day\u2019s work can mean the difference between having money for food or not", "authors": ["Vivian Ho", "Mario Koran", "Bill Mckibben"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3e5c0f8cfe4f250372f32c6266ced8a35ad980b/0_84_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3c3ed0703eff3d69fbe6fe2622ce31e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
