State-run IRNA agency said the oil leak was now under control.\n\nThe alleged attack is the latest incident involving oil tankers in the Red Sea and Gulf region, and is likely to ratchet up tensions between regional foes Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Red Sea is a major global shipping route for oil and other trade, linking the Indian Ocean with the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. Crude prices jumped on the news and industry sources said it could drive up already high shipping costs.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility. Saudi Arabia had no immediate comment.\n\nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, which operates in the region, said it was aware of media reports about the tanker, but did not have any further information.\n\nTensions with the United States have been running high since Washington withdrew from a deal between world powers and Iran that aimed to rein in Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. U.S. sanctions have slashed Iranian oil exports, on which Tehran relies.\n\nResponding to Friday\u2019s incident, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman said Beijing hoped all parties would work to uphold peace and stability in the region. China is the top buyer of Iranian oil.\n\nPRICE JUMP\n\nIran\u2019s ISNA news agency cited a source saying the Iranian tanker was struck in a \u201cterrorist\u201d attack. Iran\u2019s state television reported that two of the ship\u2019s tanks were damaged.\n\nThe incident follows strikes on key Saudi oil installations in September and attacks on tankers in the Gulf area in May and June. The United States has blamed Iran, which denied any role.\n\nOil prices climbed 2% after reports of the tanker explosion, with benchmark Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures both rising more than $1 a barrel.\n\nNIOC identified the ship as Sabiti, a Suezmax vessel, after initial reports had said it was the Sinopa, another Suezmax ship. Refinitiv ship tracking data gave the Sabiti\u2019s last reported position on Aug. 14 as off Iran\u2019s southern coast in the Gulf.\n\nIran\u2019s Nour news agency, which is close to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, said the ship\u2019s crew was safe.\n\nThe Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi oil sites in the east of the kingdom shut down 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of production, about half of Saudi output and roughly 5% of global supply. Output has since been restored.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility for those attacks, but a U.S. official said they originated from southwestern Iran. Riyadh blamed Tehran. Iran denied any role.\n\nIndustry sources said Friday\u2019s incident off the Saudi coast could drive up shipping costs, which have already surged.\n\n\u201cWar risk insurance premiums for the Red Sea will now likely go up significantly, as will likely the freight (rates),\u201d said Ashok Sharma, managing director of shipbroker BRS Baxi in Singapore.\n\nTanker rates have soared to multi-year highs in recent weeks after U.S. sanctions on units of Chinese shipping giant COSCO and after the attacks on Saudi oil sites.\n\nDisruption to shipping through Red Sea would affect oil passing through the Suez Canal or SUMED crude pipeline, which has capacity for 2.34 million bpd and which runs parallel to the canal. It is used by tankers that cannot navigate the waterway.", "description": "An Iranian-owned oil tanker was hit by two missiles in the Red Sea off the Saudi port city of Jeddah on Friday, Iran's state television reported, quoting the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) which owns the vessel.", "authors": ["Parisa Hafezi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
