The sudden shake-up comes as the president faces pressing decisions on difficult foreign policy issues. (Sept. 11) AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump's former deputy national security adviser was called to testify Monday in the House impeachment inquiry about withholding military aid for Ukraine while the president urged that country to investigate his political rival.\n\nCharles Kupperman, who served as deputy to former National Security Adviser John Bolton before both men left the White House in September, could potentially provide lawmakers with more information about the debate over Ukraine policy that other witnesses have said was guided by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nBut Kupperman is also uncertain about whether to appear. He filed a lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court asking a judge to decide whether he should testify because he's worried any decision he makes \"will inflict grave Constitutional injury on either the House or the President.\"\n\nKupperman noted in the 17-page filing that if he defies Trump, he could hurt the president's ability to receive confidential advice from top aides. But if he defies the House subpoena, he could impede their constitutional duty to investigate potential impeachment and could be subject to criminal penalties for contempt. Kupperman said he didn't take a position on whether the executive or legislative branch should prevail, but that the judicial branch should resolve the dispute.\n\nThe chairmen of the three committees \u2014 Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y, of Foreign Affairs; Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of Intelligence; and Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., of Oversight \u2014 wrote Kupperman a letter Saturday saying the lawsuit was meritless and warning that his defiance of the subpoena could be evidence of contempt. The three said the deposition would start on time and he should be there.\n\n\u201cDr. Kupperman\u2019s lawsuit\u2014lacking in legal merit and apparently coordinated with the White House\u2014is an obvious and desperate tactic by the President to delay and obstruct the lawful constitutional functions of Congress and conceal evidence about his conduct from the impeachment inquiry,\u201d the chairmen wrote.\n\nWhistleblower: Watchdogs rebuke DOJ's handling of whistleblower letter at heart of Trump impeachment prob\n\nThree key committees \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 are investigating how Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid during the summer while also urging Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. An official impeachment inquiry of Trump began Sept. 24.\n\nDemocrats contend the effort could be an impeachable abuse of power. But House Republicans have accused Democrats of selectively leaking snippets of testimony from the closed-door sessions to make the president look bad. Trump has vigorously defended his authority to urge the investigation of corruption and called the inquiry a partisan \"witch hunt.\"\n\nKupperman left the White House days after Bolton, who either resigned, according to his own account, or was fired, according to Trump, because he \"disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions.\"\n\nGOP protest: Republicans say Trump impeachment probe is happening in 'secret,' but 47 GOP lawmakers have access\n\nBolton, who may also be called to testify, opposed Giuliani's influence in pushing Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukraine energy company. Bolton urged other officials to report their concerns to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to witnesses in the House inquiry witnesses.\n\nFiona Hill, the former NSC senior director for Europe and Russia, who told lawmakers Oct. 14 that Bolton said he wasn\u2019t part of \u201cwhatever drug deal\u201d that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney were \u201ccooking up,\" according to her testimony. And Bolton reportedly referred to Giuliani as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\" according to Hill. Bolton told her to notify NSC lawyer John Eisenberg about a July 10 White House meeting of officials dealing on Ukraine.\n\nBill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, also told lawmakers Oct. 22 that Bolton directed Hill to \u201cbrief the lawyers\u201d about the \u201cdrug deal\u201d he referenced in the July 10 meeting. Bolton became \u201cso irritated\u201d about the proposal to require Ukraine investigations before agreeing to an Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelensky that Bolton \u201cabruptly ended the meeting,\u201d according to Taylor. Bolton also opposed a call between Trump and Zelensky out of concern it \u201cwould be a disaster,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nHillary Clinton: Former secretary of state's ties to impeachment inquiries against three presidents\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/28/live-trump-impeachment-inquiry-updates-bolton-ex-deputy-kupperman-ukraine/2453300001/", "description": "Charles Kupperman, President Donald Trump's former deputy national security adviser was summoned to testify Monday in the House impeachment inquiry", "authors": ["Bart Jansen", "Published A.M.
