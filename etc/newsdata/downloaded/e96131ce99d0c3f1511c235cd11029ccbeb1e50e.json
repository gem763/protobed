And open borders, by definition, would result in the United States ceasing to exist as a sovereign nation.\n\nThis and other such policies and behaviors by Democrats favor the globalist, not the American. As a result, they are anti-American. To be called anti-American and/or un-American is a heavy call. Well, these are heavy times. When shoes fit, they fit, whether the wearer is well-informed or not.\n\nPresident Trump is fighting to restore America\u2019s integrity in world politics and its own sovereignty, just as Great Britain is fighting to regain its own integrity and sovereignty from the European Union.\n\nDemocrats and the leftist progressives of the world are working to destroy the nation-state with the plan of world government. It\u2019s what the ongoing \u201cclimate change\u201d discussion is truly about and has been about since the 1970s: controlling every country from the strongest to the weakest.\n\nIn the United States, Democrats prefer to apologize for the success, strength and history of America, as well as the good the country does in the world. It\u2019s the only way to explain their behavior since day one, when a newly elected American president said simply, \u201cAmerica first.\u201d\n\nWhen Democrats riot in the streets over the overdue idea of reclaiming American sovereignty, there is not much else that needs to be said. Let the chips fall where they will.\n\nGARY A. GUBISCH\n\nColumbia, Md.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
