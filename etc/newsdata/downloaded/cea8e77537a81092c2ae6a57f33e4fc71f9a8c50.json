And it can all be yours for an exorbitant fee.\n\nIn 2006, the famed magician bought the 100-acre island of Musha Cay and its surrounding chain for $50 million, and with $40 million and five years of remodeling, made it into what he\u2019s dubbed \u201cthe most magical vacation destination in the world.\u201d Copperfield found the island after apparently drawing crisscrossing lines between Easter Island and Stonehenge, and the Pyramid of Giza and the Pyramid of the Sun in the Yucatan, and determining the exact spot at which the two intersected. The main resort island is actually one of 11 islands, all owned by the illusionist, in what\u2019s been named Copperfield Bay. The others boast names like Forbidden Island, Enchanted Island, Secret Cay, and Imagine Island\u2014incorporating 40 secluded beaches in all.", "description": "From the fountain of youth to a real treasure hunt, inside the famous illusionist's  11-island property.", "authors": ["Nina Strochlic"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492458830/articles/2013/11/21/david-copperfield-s-magical-and-utterly-bizarre-caribbean-island/131120-strochlic-copperfield-tease-NEW_af72bt", "published_at": "2013-11-21"}
