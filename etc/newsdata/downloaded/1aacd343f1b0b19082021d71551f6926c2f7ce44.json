Oracle also challenged the bid process in federal court, but lost.\n\nThe resulting system will store and process vast amounts of classified data, allowing the U.S. military to use artificial intelligence to speed up its war planning and fighting capabilities.\n\nThe Department of Defense emphasized in an announcement that the process was fair and followed procurement guidelines.\n\nOver the last year, Microsoft has positioned itself as a friend to the U.S. military.
