Chris Murphy slammed Republicans on Sunday, accusing them of being more loyal to President Donald Trump than the country amid a House impeachment inquiry centered on the commander in chief\u2018s efforts to push Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\n\"This entire country should be scared that at a moment when we need patriots, what we are getting is blind partisan loyalty,\" Murphy said in an interview on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nMurphy, a Connecticut Democrat, followed Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who made waves last week when he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the top U.S. diplomat to the European Union told him in August that nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine was being held up in exchange for Kiev probing U.S. elections, a charge Trump later denied in a phone call with the senator.\n\nBut on Sunday, Johnson defended Trump, saying he was \"sympathetic with what the president has gone through\" and that Democrats were actually relitigating the 2016 presidential election. Other congressional Republicans also eschewed criticism of Trump.\n\nThough he called Johnson \"a good friend,\" Murphy said he's \"scared\" by Republicans' posture after Trump called on the governments of Ukraine and China to investigate Biden, one of his chief political rivals in the 2020 presidential race.\n\n\"That interview was just a giant green light to the president of the United States to continue to solicit foreign interference in U.S. elections,\" Murphy said of Johnson. \"He telegraphed that he's gonna ask China to do the same thing he asked the Ukrainians to do this week because Republicans are allowing to \u2014 are \u2014 are allowing him to do it.\"\n\nStill, Murphy predicted public opinion could change rapidly \"as you see more Republicans go into the bunker ... and the president go deeper into trying to get ... more countries to interfere in our elections.\"\n\n\"I feel like this is a moment where patriots need to step up and try to save this country,\" Murphy said. \"And I think there are a lot of regular citizens out there that are going to demand that their members of Congress look at the facts, make a decision on the facts, not make a decision based on their loyalty to the cult of Donald Trump.\"", "description": "Democratic Sen.
