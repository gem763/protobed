It warned it would retaliate against any attacks after the US announced it was sending troops to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Clearly if we are asked either by the Saudis or the Americans to have a role then we would consider in what way we could be useful,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\n'Diplomatic response'\n\nAsked if military action was possible, he said: \"We will consider in what way we could be useful if asked and depending on what the exact plan is.\"\n\nSanctions also remained on the table, he said.\n\nA Whitehall source said the Houthi rebels' claim of responsibility was \"implausible\" as the \"scale, sophistication and range\" of the attack was beyond their capabilities.\n\nThe prime minister is attending a joint meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the UN to discuss the attacks, along with Brexit.\n\nMr Johnson is also due to meet US President Donald Trump, and the two have discussed the need for a \"united diplomatic response\".\n\nIn his meeting with Mr Rouhani, the prime minister said he would also bring up the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual British-Iranian nationals held in Tehran.\n\nMr Johnson came under severe criticism as foreign secretary after appearing to contradict Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who says she was in Iran visiting family.\n\nShe is serving a five-year sentence on spying charges, which she has always denied.", "description": "The prime minister declines to rule out military action ahead of talks with Iran at the UN.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B270/production/_108908654_ed1cecbf-7b83-4875-88a6-8b69344e89f6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
