However, there are still some good deals happening.\n\nDay 2 of Amazon Prime Day 2019 is underway, and things are slowing down. There are fewer Lightning Deals popping up than we saw yesterday, though there are still some great prices to check out. You\u2019ll have time to shop the tech deals below until tonight at 2:59AM ET / 11:59PM PT.\n\nOnce Prime Day ends, most of the deals will end \u2014 though not all of them. However, you\u2019ll no longer be able to get $300 off of the Samsung Galaxy S10, to name a popular example.\n\nIf you\u2019re just joining us, you\u2019ll need an Amazon Prime subscription to get in on the deals. You can get started with a free 30-day trial to the service, then either let it auto-renew, or cancel it once the trial comes to an end.\n\nYou\u2019ll find nothing but the best remaining deals below on Android phones, 4K televisions, tablets, smart displays, gaming tech, PC components, speakers, headphones, and much more. We\u2019ll be monitoring sales, updating this page with new additions, and striking out inactive ones along the way.\n\nEntertainment\n\nUnlocked phones\n\nTablets\n\nWearables\n\nConnected home / security\n\nAccessories / Portable Storage\n\nGaming\n\nLaptops / Desktops\n\nPC components", "description": "Amazon Prime Day 2019 ends later today, but there\u2019s still time to get a great deal on tech like the Sonos Beam, Samsung Galaxy S10, Nintendo Switch, Jabra truly wireless headphones, and much more.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KFmeH6aCKYGWKLnvWK5bIQ2Babk=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16447559/acastro_190621_1777_prime_day_0002.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-15"}
