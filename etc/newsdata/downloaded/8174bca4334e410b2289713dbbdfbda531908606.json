(AP) - Zach Charbonnet had a 2-yard touchdown run to give No. 19 Michigan an early double-digit lead and its defense did the rest against No. 14 Iowa, forcing four turnovers and making eight sacks in a 10-3 victory Saturday.\n\nThe Wolverines (4-1, 2-1 Big Ten) were held scoreless over the final three quarters because they could not run or pass effectively, scoring just three points off the Hawkeyes\u2019 turnovers.\n\nIowa (4-1, 1-1) failed to take advantage of favorable field position on its final two drives with a chance to extend the game or possibly win it with a touchdown and 2-point conversion. The Hawkeyes turned the ball over on downs at the Michigan 44 with 37 seconds left after a penalty- and sack-filled drive forced them to punt with a fourth-and-36 at midfield on the previous possession.\n\nIowa running back Mekhi Sargent fumbled on his team\u2019s first snap, giving up the ball at the Hawkeyes 18. Michigan, though, had to settle for a field goal after gaining just 6 yards. The Wolverines took a 10-0 lead on their next drive, which started with a 51-yard pass to Nico Collins and finished with Charbonnet\u2019s 2-yard run.\n\nIowa avoided a shutout with Keith Duncan\u2019s 22-yard field goal early in the second quarter.\n\nMichigan\u2019s Shea Patterson was 14 of 26 for 147 yards with an interception.\n\nIowa\u2019s Nate Stanley was 23 of 42 for 260 yards with three interceptions, ending a 139-pass streak without getting picked off.\n\nNO. 5 LSU 42, UTAH STATE 6\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - Joe Burrow became the first LSU quarterback to eclipse 300 yards passing in four straight games and threw for five touchdowns against Utah State.\n\nBurrow completed 27 of 38 passes for 344 yards and was intercepted once on a tipped pass before being replaced by Myles Brennan on LSU\u2019s second series of the fourth quarter. Burrow also rushed for 42 yards and touchdown.\n\nBurrow has completed 78.3 percent of his passes for 1,864 yards and 22 touchdowns through five games as he remains on pace to threaten most LSU single-season passing records.\n\nJustin Jefferson caught two scoring passes for LSU (5-0). His second TD on a 39-yard throw was the completion on which Burrow surpassed 300 yards. Burrow\u2019s other TD strikes went to Derrick Dillon, JaMarr Chase and tight end Thaddeus Moss.\n\nThe Aggies (3-2) had 159 yards of offense.\n\nNO. 6 OKLAHOMA 45, KANSAS 20\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) - Jalen Hurts threw for 228 yards and two touchdowns, ran for 56 yards and two more TDs and added another line to his Heisman Trophy resume in leading Oklahoma.\n\nRhamondre Stevenson added 109 yards rushing and a score on just five carries for Oklahoma. The Sooners (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) spotted Kansas (2-4, 0-2) a touchdown lead before ripping off seven straight scores.\n\nThat allowed them to cruise to their 22nd straight true road win, the second-longest streak since at least World War II in major college football. Bud Wilkinson\u2019s Sooners won 25 in a row from 1953-58. It also allowed Oklahoma to build momentum for next weekend\u2019s Red River Showdown with No. 11 Texas.\n\nNO. 8 WISCONSIN 48, KENT STATE 0\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) - Jonathan Taylor had four rushing touchdowns and caught a TD pass, Zack Baun had a career-high three sacks, and Wisconsin coasted to past Kent State.\n\nTaylor had 19 rushes for 186 yards, eclipsing the 100-yard mark for the 27th time in 32 career games with the Badgers (5-0).\n\nBaun\u2019s three sacks led a Wisconsin defense to its third shutout of the season. The Badgers held Kent State (2-3) to 124 yards of total offense. Chris Orr added two sacks for a unit that has allowed four touchdowns through five games.\n\nDustin Crum and Woody Barrett combined for just 64 yards on 10-of-17 passing.\n\nNO. 12 PENN STATE 35, PURDUE 7\n\nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) - Sean Clifford threw for 264 yards with three touchdowns and ran for another score for Penn State.\n\nThe Nittany Lions (5-0, 2-0 Big Ten) were dominant on defense, with 10 sacks, one shy of the school single-game record. The Boilermakers were held to 104 yards.\n\nPlaying without starting quarterback Elijah Sindelar and star receiver Rondale Moore, the Boilermakers (1-4, 0-2) didn\u2019t cross midfield until their sixth possession midway through the second.\n\nPenn State jumped out fast, scoring on its first four drives, none lasting longer than 3:41.\n\nTEXAS TECH 45, OKLAHOMA STATE 35\n\nLUBBOCK, Texas (AP) - Jett Duffey threw four touchdown passes and ran for another score in his first start of the season, leading Texas Tech past Oklahoma State.\n\nTexas Tech (3-2, 1-1 Big 12), coming off a 55-16 loss at Oklahoma two weeks ago, built a 20-0 lead 30 seconds into the second quarter and won its second straight in the series after going 0-10-2 in the previous 12 meetings.\n\nDuffey completed 26 of 44 passes for 424 yards with scoring passes to Erik Ezukanma, T.J. Vashe, KeSean Carter and Dalton Rigdon. Duffey had a 16-yard touchdown run.\n\nOklahoma State (4-2, 1-2) committed five turnovers, three interceptions and two fumbles by redshirt freshman quarterback Spencer Sanders. Chuba Hubbard ran for 156 yards and three touchdowns.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/APTop25CollegeFootballPoll and https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Zach Charbonnet had a 2-yard touchdown run to give No. 19 Michigan an early double-digit lead and its defense did the rest against No. 14 Iowa, forcing four turnovers and making eight sacks in a 10-3 victory Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/aptopix_iowa_michigan_football_45695_c0-173-4129-2580_s1770x1032.jpg?5c47d6aee9f01121ea16ce33010eed1c18b6802f", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
