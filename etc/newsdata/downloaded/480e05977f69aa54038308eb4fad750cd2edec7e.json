For the briefest moment, after half-an-hour dominated by the bubbling West Ham winger\u2019s infectious laughter, a cold silence takes over as he relives a memory now over 16 years old. \u201cHe called me a monkey,\u201d he says.\n\nIt was the first time Antonio experienced racist abuse on a football pitch and, although he\u2019s encountered it again since, the recollection of that Sunday League match stings ineradicably. He courses through the spiral of emotions that followed: confusion, resentment, rage and the furious desire to defend himself. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he says, suddenly punching back into the present.\n\n\u201cI really shouldn\u2019t say this in case I ever play for them, but Millwall got fined \u00a310,000 for racist chanting. Last season, Leeds got fined \u00a330,000 for having a member of staff watch Derby training from a public path. Robert Snodgrass got fined \u00a325,000 for \u2018shouting\u2019 at a drug-testing official. How does that work? Is racism lower down?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

After climbing six divisions, he has made over 100 appearances for West Ham and received two England call-ups. So, having experienced football\u2019s crown and underbelly, it\u2019s fair to say that he is overly familiar with all its usual questions. Instead, ahead of his drive to Rush Green, Antonio is at his most impassioned and articulate when speaking about the subjects that have shaped and sometimes scarred him, and stretch far beyond sport\u2019s bubble of insularity.\n\n\u201cYou either have to fine clubs ridiculous money or take away points because that affects the fans,\u201d he continues, recalling the recent plague of racist incidents that have marred English football\u2019s return. \u201cWhen money gets taken from the club, the fans don\u2019t really care. If you deduct points, it can actually have a real impact.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Michail Antonio X GAFFER Magazine Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

He mourns the bulldozed rec centres and adventure parks in south London that were supposed to act as deterrents. Rags to riches stories in sport are far from infrequent but, for Antonio, escape also gave him a voice.\n\nHe stresses that stricter punishments have to be introduced to counter London\u2019s surge in knife crime. \u201cI understand when it\u2019s someone who is 10 or 12 years old getting caught up in gangs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut once it gets to about 14 or 15, you need to start trialling people as adults. If you\u2019re old enough to learn for your GCSEs, you know it\u2019s wrong to stab somebody. If kids think they can do adult things, well, then they have to take responsibility for those actions.\u201d\n\nAntonio also recognises the lack of support many children suffer from and the debt of gratitude he owes his older brother for guiding him along that teenage tightrope. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was always a bit of a fighter,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it was, but I had that anger problem. The slightest thing used to set me off and people see that and gangs want you to join their thing. Thankfully, I had my brother to give me the insight [to stay away]. Within three years, those gangs were fighting each other, people were getting stabbed, people were getting shot, it was crazy.\u201d\n\nAfter Antonio\u2019s parents rejected a place in Tottenham\u2019s academy due to fears the commute would damage his education, he spent his early career treading water at Providence House \u2013 a youth club in Clapham Junction \u2013 and for Tooting & Mitcham\u2019s youth sides. But, by the time he turned 18, working part-time as a lifeguard and training to be a PE teacher, he was struggling to stay afloat.\n\n\u201cI always said to myself that I\u2019d be a professional but all my friends had money and I had nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cI was making \u00a3150-a-week playing in old F30s from JD Sports. I was ready to pack it in but my brother knew how much I\u2019d given up for football. He said he\u2019d buy me a new pair of boots if I carried on. I\u2019d never had a real pair of boots in my life. He bought me a pair of Total 90s, the ones Wayne Rooney used to wear. Within three months, I got signed for Reading.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the latter years, at Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forrest and West Ham, for which Antonio is recognised. But, to him, it\u2019s the lasting residue of that earlier unlit life that\u2019s given him a wider sense of perspective. \u201cYou learn to form that never-say-die attitude to keep going [when you start out like that],\u201d he says. \u201cIn the lower-leagues, it could be very easy to say I\u2019m happy to have finally got where I am, but you have to aspire to be more. I\u2019ve always wanted to be better. Some people like that, some people don\u2019t. Some people call it arrogance, some people call it confidence, but you\u2019ve got to believe in yourself and have that resilience.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that conviction which Antonio leans on to address subjects more easily stepped around. The unseen years that forged a maturity and identity which can\u2019t be dictated by football.\n\nThe realisation that, even if only to a small extent, he might be able to influence change on some of the issues that have played on his mind since he was a 13-year-old boy. \u201cPeople say football is my life because it\u2019s my job, but it\u2019s not,\u201d he says. \u201cIt all goes by in a blink and you just have to remember to enjoy it. Everyone has to try and be a shepherd, not a sheep.\u201d\n\nGAFFER Issue 02: Heart & Soul honours the way football cultivates community spirit, empowers the next generation and gives fans, teams and players something bigger and more beautiful to believe in", "description": "Under the glare of East London\u2019s early morning sun, a flash of anger pierces Michail Antonio\u2019s eyes.
