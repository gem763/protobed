It is still meeting banks pitching for roles on the deal, and is expected to appoint the advisers in the coming days, two of the sources said.\n\nMorgan Stanley, JPMorgan and HSBC were chosen to play a leading role in the transaction before the process was halted last year.\n\nGoldman Sachs, HSBC, and JPMorgan declined to comment.\n\nAramco declined to comment to a separate Reuters request on the likely appointment of JPMorgan, and did not comment on a subsequent request on the likely roles of the other banks.\n\nCiti, Samba, Morgan Stanley and National Commercial Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe IPO is a centrepiece of Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic transformation drive to attract foreign investment and diversify away from oil.\n\nThe kingdom is gearing up to fast-track a local listing of Aramco by bringing in the head of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Yassir al-Rumayyan, who was recently named new chairman of the state oil giant and leads an executive committee overseeing plans to float shares in Aramco.\n\nShould Aramco proceed with a local listing this year, international banks on the deal would be tasked with promoting the company to international investors looking to buy its shares on the Saudi main exchange, Tadawul.\n\nIt is not clear yet on which international exchange Aramco would list its shares, but sources have recently told Reuters that the board of Saudi Aramco has determined that listing in New York would carry too many legal risks to make it a realistic option.\n\nEarlier this year Aramco raised $12 billion in its first international bond issue, obtaining over $100 billion in demand.\n\nMany saw that deal as a relationship-building exercise with international investors ahead of its planned initial public offering, scheduled for last year and then postponed to 2020-2021.\n\nThe debt sale was expected to help fund Aramco\u2019s $69.1 billion acquisition of a 70% stake in petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, a deal that many saw as a transfer of government funds aimed at boosting the Saudi Crown Prince\u2019s economic agenda.", "description": "Saudi Aramco is expected to give lead roles to JPMorgan , Morgan Stanley and National Commercial Bank <1180.SE> for its planned initial public offering (IPO), a source familiar with the transaction said.", "authors": ["Hadeel Al Sayegh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427862719&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880IY", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
