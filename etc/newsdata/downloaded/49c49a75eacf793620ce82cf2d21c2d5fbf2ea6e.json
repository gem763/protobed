But here it comes.\n\nThe Nationals close the regular season with 17 games in the next 17 days with a spot in the playoffs at stake. In the process, the Nats, who lead the Cubs and Brewers by 3\u00bd games for the National League\u2019s first wild-card spot, also have a chance to toughen themselves against top competition while working pitchers Max Scherzer and Sean Doolittle back to top form.\n\nWhat a rare opportunity, wrapped up in a nasty challenge. The Nats are in a 27-game gantlet to season\u2019s end in which they play 24 games against contenders, including 13 games with division leaders. They essentially are facing playoff-quality foes for an entire month. At least they still have 11 games left at Nationals Park, where they plead to their fans: Please make noise.\n\nSeptember is the month when things come together or fall apart for contenders. Right now, the Nats are on that knife\u2019s edge. For the season\u2019s first 50 games, they played like clowns; for the next 85, like champs; and for the past 10 (4-6), like a team that has cooled off while facing a stern schedule.\n\nDespite a wild-card lead that puts the Nats\u2019 chance to make the postseason at 97.9 percent, this is a direction-of-the-franchise test of a shaky rebuilt bullpen, a second-year manager and a franchise with a bitter history of poor pressure play. As Anthony Rendon, in his walk year, and Stephen Strasburg, with an opt-out in his contract, decide about their futures, they will be watching how this team plays.\n\nIf any team ever had a toughen-\u2019em-up-for-October test, it\u2019s the Nats now. For years we have heard the Nats had it too easy in romping to their four division titles. Well, \u201cproblem\u201d solved. Unless, of course, the Nats keep stumbling. Then this month could be crack-\u2019em-up, not shape-\u2019em-up.\n\n[How the Nationals\u2019 rotation lines up for the rest of the regular season \u2014 and beyond]\n\nEight years ago, the Red Sox and Braves entered September with even better odds at a wild-card spot than the Nats have now. They went 7-20 and 9-18, respectively, to miss the postseason on the last night of the regular season and become catastrophic lore. Nats Manager Dave Martinez, then a coach with Tampa Bay, can tell his team about it. On the last night, the Rays trailed 7-0 but won and snatched the wild card as Boston\u2019s Jonathan Papelbon blew a save in Baltimore.\n\nWith a roster as close to full health as teams get this late in a season, the Nats are in fine position to avoid any such nightmare. While the Nats add pieces \u2014 the pickup of Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera (29 RBI in 24 games) and the return of Ryan Zimmerman (10 RBI in 24 at-bats) \u2014 those trying to catch them have had horrible injury luck. The Cubs lost star Javier B\u00e1ez (broken thumb) for the rest of this month; their closer, Craig Kimbrel, (sore forearm) isn\u2019t back from the injured list yet. The Brewers just lost superstar Christian Yelich (broken kneecap) for the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the powerful Dodgers have a problem. Hyun-Jin Ryu, who had the lowest ERA in baseball in 2018-19 (1.68) just a month ago, has been getting bombed with a 9.95 ERA in four starts. Has this key member of L.A.\u2019s Big Three hit a workload wall? After missing almost all of 2015-16 following elbow surgery, Ryu has worked just 126\u2154 , then 82 \u2153 innings the past two years. This year, he\u2019s at 161\u2153 and counting.\n\nWith slugger Max Muncy not quite back yet from a fracture in his wrist and Los Angeles just 14-12 during Ryu\u2019s funk, the Dodgers are still the NL\u2019s best team. But is the gap over the Braves, Nats and Cardinals shrinking from miles to yards?\n\nAs for the Phillies, who are \u00ad5\u00bd games behind the Nats, every time they turn around someone gets hurt with their M.A.S.H. list now 10 deep.\n\n[For some Marines, intramural softball championship at Nationals Park is \u2018like a dream come true\u2019]\n\nThe Nats have their worries, too. Doolittle is their only true high-quality reliever. Yet this week, back from the IL, he\u2019s still being used only as a middle-inning matchup lefty, not back as closer. Is that a small \u201cYikes\u201d?\n\nAs for Scherzer, after two months of back misery, rehab and training-wheel starts, he finally looked semi-Mad in six winning innings in Atlanta on Sunday. Watch his rematch with the Braves this weekend in D.C. to see whether he will be full-bore Hall of Fame Mad Max by the wild-card game Oct. 1.\n\nThis month will be about not only who makes it to October but whom they will match up with if they get there and whether their club will arrive in top form or severely hobbled. If the Nats have a wild-card matchup to worry about, it\u2019s the Mets, who have had their number and have Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard as starting options.\n\nWashington sports fans often seem to live to worry. They have reasons. And a wild-card game was created to be an instant heart attack. No pitching matchup can prevent a defeat in one lone fluky ballgame.\n\nBut as counterbalance, after Thursday\u2019s game, the Nats were not only 97.9 percent to make the playoffs but 54.1 to win the wild-card game and also 25.3 to win a division series over Los Angeles to reach the NL Championship Series. Those are all better numbers than I would have expected.\n\n[As feds probe MLB\u2019s Latin American operations, a flashy scout and contested deal draw interest]\n\nWhat, you\u2019re not interested in a one-in-four chance to reach the semifinals in a major sport, something just two Washington teams (both times the Capitals) have done in the past 28 years? People who lay money for a living think the Nats have a 15.1 percent chance to go to the World Series. That\u2019s plenty to get my attention as I wait for the Redskins to have their first 11-win season since 1991.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to underestimate the value of being a wild card. Under the current format since 2012, most Octobers have brought us a team that, after winning its life-or-death game, went on to win at least one more series.\n\nThe 2017 Yankees, 2016 Blue Jays, 2015 Cubs, 2014 Giants, 2014 Royals and 2012 Cardinals all won their division series against foes who had had better regular season records (by an average of nine wins). Those Yankees and Cardinals eventually got knocked out in Game 7s of their league championship series, one win from the World Series. Their fans probably weren\u2019t too disappointed with such a wild ride. San Francisco and Kansas City went all the way to the 2014 World Series, won by Madison Bumgarner\u2019s Giants.\n\nTough Septembers can be excellent preparation for fine Octobers. On Sept. 15, 1924, the Washington Senators, led by Walter Johnson, were tied for first place in the American League with the New York Yankees, led by Babe Ruth, with 13 games left in the regular season. The Senators went 10-3, nipped the Yankees on the last weekend, then won Washington\u2019s only World Series. Battle-hardened.\n\nIn 17 days, the Nats will complete a four-week trek through some of the best teams in both leagues with tons of playoff-level pitching. If they earn the right to play another game Oct. 1, even that might not be their last. Wild-card game winners always play with house money. And they just let it ride.\n\nFor more by Thomas Boswell, visit washingtonpost.com/boswell.", "description": "In the midst of a month against playoff-worthy competition, Washington could emerge resilient, or reduced.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist", "September At Am", "Tom Boswell Has Been A Washington Post Sports Columnist Since He Started At The Post In As A Copy Aide", "He Spent Years As A General-Assignment Reporter", "Covering Baseball", "Golf", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Boxing"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nHU9OylChSDV908cCh7PvMvIp64=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3RR7JFWNYEI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
