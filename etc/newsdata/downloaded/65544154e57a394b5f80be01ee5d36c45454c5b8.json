and told businesses the tariffs would come into force on 18 October.\n\nThe tariffs come at a crucial time for the UK, which is preparing to leave the EU and strike trade deals with other nations, including the US.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss says: \"Resorting to tit-for-tat tariffs is not in any country's best interests and we are in regular contact with the Trump administration, urging them to refrain from resorting to such measures.\n\n\"As well as causing temporary disruption to UK businesses, it would also hit American consumers in the pocket.\"\n\nImportant market\n\nKathryn Sargent, Savile Row's first female master tailor, is concerned that her clients in the US, who make up a third of her business, may not be aware of the new tax.\n\nShe travels to cities such as New York, Chicago and Washington DC three times a year to visit customers, show them fabrics and do fittings for her suits, which start at about \u00a35,500.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Kathryn Sargent is Savile Row's first female master tailor\n\n\"It is a conversation that I'll be having with my clients when I'm over there, to sense what their reaction is and to see if it puts them off placing future orders,\" she says.\n\nNorth America is an important market for Savile Row, as well as the wider British luxury industry.\n\nMr Sleater reckons that total sales of the street's goods into the US total some \u00a340m.\n\nThe US is also the second largest export market, behind Europe, for UK luxury products, according to Walpole, the trade body for the British luxury sector, and Frontier Economics.\n\nBut it is not just the business connection between the two countries that is important to Savile Row's tailors.\n\n\"All the past US presidents have had garments made in Savile Row,\" says Ms Sargent. \"When you think of all the Hollywood greats like Fred Astaire and Cary Grant, there is a beautiful relationship between Savile Row and America, so this tariff really hits us hard.\"\n\nShe hopes that her US clients' \"love of British quality craftsmanship\" will overcome any concerns about the added cost of buying a Savile Row suit.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Fred Astaire, seen here with Audrey Hepburn while filming Funny Face, was a fan of Savile Row suits\n\nSmall bespoke tailoring firms like Ms Sargent's will not be able to absorb the cost of the tax.\n\nMr Dixon says that Richard James, one of the few Savile Row tailors with a store in the US, says it will do its best to absorb the cost: \"But we think there will be a price\u2026 we will have to pass some of this on to our customers.\"\n\n'Affluent'\n\nArguably, the type of people who have a bespoke suit made by a Savile Row tailor are not short of a pound or two.\n\n\"The customer base is fairly affluent,\" admits Mr Dixon, whose clients include actor Benedict Cumberbatch, footballer David Beckham and rapper P Diddy. \"Nevertheless, an increase is an increase and we pride ourselves on people getting value for money, especially for a Savile Row suit.\n\n\"The amount of man-hours that go into it, the incredible fabrics used and a suit that can last 20 years or 30 years and then to have a big part of that being paid in tax. I don't know how people are going to feel about that.\"\n\nWhile Savile Row's tailors were shocked by the tariffs, Walpole was not.\n\n\"We're disappointed, of course,\" says Charlotte Keesing, Walpole's director of public policy and international. \"But we're not surprised that suiting and textiles and fine fabrics came so heavily top of the list.\"\n\nShe says that UK luxury goods such as cashmere sweaters have often been targeted by the US in trade tussles.\n\nImage copyright Jeff J Mitchell Image caption Cad & the Dandy dressed Mike Tindall for his marriage wedding to Zara Phillips, daughter of Princess Anne, in 2011\n\nIn 1999, when Bill Clinton was in the White House, Scottish cashmere sweaters faced sanctions following a WTO ruling in a row between the US and the UK about bananas.\n\nBut Ms Keesing does not think this latest round of tariffs will have a major impact on sales of UK luxury goods.\n\n\"You have quite a weak pound at the moment and the number of US visitors coming to the UK to shop for these kinds of goods is at an all-time high, so I don't think that the impact is going to be enormous,\" she says.\n\nBig win?\n\nPresident Trump, who reportedly favours suits made by Italy's Brioni, described the WTO ruling at the beginning of October as a \"big win\" for the US.\n\nBut his jubilation - and any pain felt by UK businesses - may be short-lived.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Actor Benedict Cumberbatch wore a Richard James suit to Wimbledon this year\n\nMs Keesing points out that next spring, the WTO will rule on Boeing, the US planemaker, which it found had benefited from tax breaks.\n\nThe EU could then be given the green light to enforce its own tariffs on US goods.\n\nMr Sleater says that while Cad & the Dandy was caught unaware by the new taxes, Savile Row should use the opportunity to elevate its brand, which has historically always been about understatement.\n\nHe says that while Italy's suitmakers - who are not facing US tariffs - have actively promoted their industry, Savile Row has not.\n\n\"The key thing about this is to stomach the tariffs being placed on us and - I'm talking about the street here - we somehow need to find a way to make our clothes even more appealing.\n\n\"Never before has there been such a time when branding is really, really important.\"", "description": "Men's wool suits are among the products facing new tariffs at a crucial time for UK trade.", "authors": ["Dearbail Jordan", "Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2DCF/production/_109272711_zacharynew.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
