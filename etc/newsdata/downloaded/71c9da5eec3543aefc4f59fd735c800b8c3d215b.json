A subsequent media alert, sent two hours later, pushed the scheduled briefing back by two hours to 15:00.\n\nThe press briefing will take place at the party's Nkululeko House headquarters in Johannesburg.\n\nMaimane ascended to the position of federal leader in May 2015, when he defeated Wilmot James at the party's congress in Port Elizabeth.\n\nOne of his most vocal supporters at the time was Mashaba, who Maimane described as a \"hero\" when the City of Johannesburg mayor announced his resignation from the party on Monday.\n\nMaimane succeeded Helen Zille as party leader.\n\nMaimane has faced increasing pressure since the beginning of 2019, with the party divided over whether to include race as a key factor in its redress policies. The strength of his leadership was also questioned in a review report compiled after the DA failed to grow its support in May's national elections.\n\nThis is a developing story. More information to follow.\n\n- Additional reporting Paul Herman and Sheldon Morais", "description": "Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane has decided to resign as federal leader of the DA, several well-placed sources in the party have confirmed to News24.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9127/e0d073e12c9a4ce48d4318c8d37bb97e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
