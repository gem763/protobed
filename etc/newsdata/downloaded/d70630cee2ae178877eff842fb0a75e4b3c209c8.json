Shaped by an industrial golden age of lace making, tobacco and bicycle manufacture, the city has been galvanised in recent years thanks to the arrival of a sleek new tram network, the angular Nottingham Contemporary gallery and the part-pedestrianisation of its artsy Hockley district.\n\nAlthough a city in flux \u2013 with the bulldozed Broadmarsh Centre undergoing a major facelift \u2013 there\u2019s plenty of personality and layers of history illuminating its compact city centre, including a Unesco-recognised literary heritage that counts Lord Byron, DH Lawrence and Alan Sillitoe among its heroes. A buoyant student population keep Nottingham\u2019s nightlife among the country\u2019s most relevant, while first-class retail, sports facilities and music venues give reason for return visits.\n\nAnd while Nottingham still lacks five-star luxury when it comes to its hotels, there is a diverse choice of characterful crash-pads, ranging from the opulent to the alternative. Here are the best.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe Independent\u2019s hotel reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust. On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and book, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nBest for art lovers: Lace Market Hotel\n\nNeighbourhood: Lace Market\n\nHitting the sweet spot between laid-back and elegant, the Lace Market Hotel takes its name from its location in the heart of Nottingham\u2019s former industrial centre. Flanked by storied red-brick warehouses, it\u2019s just a short walk to the Nottingham Contemporary. Each of its 42 rooms comes in a muted greyscale palette brought to life with splashes of colour and tactile throws, while superior suites have freestanding bathtubs with views over the rooftops. Artful photographs of bygone Nottingham add character to the common areas, while the Saint cocktail bar is an excellent spot in which to dissect the day\u2019s discoveries.\n\nDouble rooms from \u00a389\n\nlacemarkethotel.co.uk\n\nBest for a foodie break: Hart\u2019s Hotel & Kitchen\n\nNeighbourhood: The Park\n\nTim Hart is something of a fine-dining pioneer in the East Midlands, having founded the Michelin-starred Hambleton Hall in the late 1970s before following up with this elegant hotel and kitchen in 1997. Set on the old ramparts of Nottingham Castle above the upmarket Park Estate, this four-star hotel won Riba architecture awards for a design that opens up with stunning views over the city. With access to a leafy terrace, the garden suites are the most sought after of the 32 rooms, which \u2013 thanks to luxe touches like L\u2019Occitane toiletries and mini cafeti\u00e8res \u2013 set the standard for hotels in the city. And the restaurant remains one of the city\u2019s hottest tables, with menus shaped by local produce, including Hambleton Hall-supplied meat and bread.\n\nRooms from \u00a3139\n\nhartsnottingham.co.uk\n\nBest for countryside charm: Langar Hall\n\nNeighbourhood: Langar\n\nTwenty minutes east of Nottingham, a glorious lime tree-lined driveway leads up to the impressive Langar Hall. This apricot-washed 19th-century manor features carp ponds and wild flower gardens in its grounds and 13 rooms a traditional country house style \u2013 think floral wallpapers and antique furnishings. An excellent restaurant is defined by local produce that includes homegrown vegetables, Langar lamb from the surrounding fields and, come game season, fresh catches from the Vale of Belvoir. A special mention goes to the Agnews chalet room, which \u2013 a short walk from the house through the gardens \u2013 lacks wi-fi, making it the perfect option for a digital detox.\n\nRooms from \u00a3125\n\nlangarhall.com\n\nBest for heritage hunters: St James\n\nNeighbourhood: City centre\n\nSandwiched between Nottingham Castle and the austere concrete office blocks that line Maid Marian Way, the four-star St James Hotel cuts a surprisingly sophisticated dash on Nottingham\u2019s hotel scene. Located at the heart of the so-called Castle Zone, it\u2019s well-placed for getting acquainted with the city\u2019s history, with Lord Byron\u2019s former digs to the north and, to the south, Nottingham Castle and the UK\u2019s self-proclaimed oldest pub, Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem. The hotel\u2019s bold decor pairs a red and purple palette with patterned wallpapers, which \u2013 while not for the faint-hearted \u2013 sits on the sophisticated side of eclectic.\n\nRooms from \u00a370\n\nstjames-hotel.com\n\nBest for the social scene: Mercure Nottingham\n\nNeighbourhood: Hockley\n\nOccupying the site of what was Nottingham\u2019s oldest hotel, the Mercure is at the heart of the city\u2019s hippest district. With independent cinemas, record and vintage stores in all directions, not to mention an al fresco bar scene birthed by Hockley\u2019s evening pedestrianisation, you might not find yourself hanging about too much. But with original features, including a striking oak staircase, sitting alongside neon artwork, bold prints and retro-modern design accessories, it packs plenty of quirky charm. It also offers several worthy hangouts of its own \u2013 including a gin bar set in a sandstone cave.\n\nRooms from \u00a360\n\nmercurenottingham.com\n\nBest for old-world decadence: Colwick Hall Hotel\n\nNeighbourhood: Colwick\n\nTwo miles west of the city centre, this Grade II-listed pile on the River Trent dates back to 1776 and its manicured grounds make a leafy alternative to Nottingham\u2019s urban sprawl. Best known as the ancestral home of Lord Byron, its heritage remains intact today with each of its 16 decadent rooms \u2013 complete with antique furniture and lavish textiles \u2013 named after poets and artists. Get outside and explore the gardens before booking into Byron\u2019s Brasserie where, beneath black and white images of Romantic-era poets, you can select from locally sourced specials that might even impress its namesake poet.\n\nRooms from \u00a389\n\ncolwickhallhotel.com\n\nBest for inner-city glamour: The Walton\n\nNeighbourhood: The Park\n\nA 10-minute walk from the city centre, this former hunting lodge straddles the boundary of Nottingham\u2019s refined gas-lit Park estate and studentsville, with the latter\u2019s influence visible through the bars and restaurants on the adjacent Derby Road. Original 19th-century features remain intact across 24 rooms that attract a diverse crowd that reflects its location. Its restaurant does a fine line in sharing boards, accompanied by a strong wine list courtesy of nearby Gauntleys Fine Wines \u2013 while its revamped sun terrace and bar is the perfect spot for people watching in the summer months.\n\nRooms from \u00a3125\n\nthewaltonhotel.com\n\nBest for all-out maximalism: Mama\u2019s Inn\n\nNeighbourhood: Mapperley Park\n\nSpread over two smart Victorian villas north of the city centre, this colourful boutique B&B launched in 2014, allowing owners Marina and David to indulge in their interior-design fantasies across 10 rooms themed by global cities. Spelled out via artwork and artefacts, rooms range from the romantic \u2013 Paris and St Petersburg come with four-poster beds and gilded cabinets \u2013 to the exotic, with the pair\u2019s hands-on hospitality securing multiple awards for excellence from booking.com and TripAdvisor. The global theme continues in the Versace-inspired breakfast room, where an 18-strong brunch menu includes croque monsieur or shakshuka or even a Japanese tamagoyaki omelette.\n\nRooms from \u00a360\n\nmamasinn.co.uk", "description": "The best hotels in Nottingham, from Victorian townhouses to cosy country houses, as chosen by our resident expert.", "authors": ["Ben Olsen"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/17/nottingham.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
