But in 2015, when he was locked up in a detention center, the defector said he heard cases of North Korean prison guards covering inmates with a black blanket, quietly escorting them out of the cell and killing them with a \u201cblunt object\u201d from behind as they walked down the hallways.The NKDB also said North Koreans were still facing human rights violations such as torture, rape, forced prostitution and illegal confinement.Another North Korean defector from North Hamgyong Province in the northeast part of the country said she was raped while locked up in a detention center after getting caught trying to flee the country.A third North Korean defector who also lived in North Hamgyong Province described the dire conditions of the North Korean military, saying she dropped from 53 kilograms (117 pounds) to 43 kilograms because there was barely anything to eat.\u201cThere were many people who weighed just 30-something kilograms,\u201d the defector said on the condition of anonymity. \u201cFor three months during boot camp training, we would mix only water, whole wheat flour and some vegetables. It was so hard for me, I used to vomit.\u201dOne key change in the ways North Korean people perceive such cruel acts by the North\u2019s authorities, however, is that they now know their human rights are being violated, said Kim So-won, a researcher at NKDB. Kim attributed the cause of such change to the rise of black markets, known as jangmadang, pointing out that information from the outer world is spreading in those markets along the border.BY KWEN YU-JIN [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
