And secondly, the government will comply with undertakings given to the court in respect of the law.\u201d\n\nBenn pointed out the undertaking given to the court was that Johnson would send a letter if specific conditions were not satisfied.\n\nBarclay said: \u201cI can confirm the government will abide by that text.\u201d\n\nThe government told a Scottish court earlier this month the prime minister accepted he would have no choice but to send a letter. However, there have been repeated briefings from No 10 that claimed ministers have found a way to bypass the law.\n\nMinisters have indicated the government could send a second letter asking the EU to ignore the first asking for an extension. The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, asked by ITV\u2019s Robert Peston last week if Johnson would send a second letter disavowing the first, replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nJoanna Cherry, a Scottish National party MP and member of the committee, asked Barclay if there was a plan to send two letters. \u201cI am not aware of any such plan,\u201d he replied.\n\nRobert Buckland, the justice secretary and lord chancellor, told another select committee he was committed to \u201cupholding the rule of law\u201d as its \u201cguardian in cabinet\u201d, promising this was a role he took extremely seriously.\n\nHis comments suggest he would not tolerate any move by Downing Street to disobey the law by refusing to stay within the strictures of the Benn act.\n\nBuckland also dismissed calls from some Conservatives for a politically appointed judiciary following the supreme court\u2019s ruling against Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament.\n\n\u201cThe day we end with US-style confirmation hearings would be a very black day for our constitution. That sort of approach would be erroneous and based on an assumption that we were creating a constitutional in the UK,\u201d he said.", "description": "Brexit secretary suggests PM will send letter to Brussels if no agreement reached", "authors": ["Rajeev Syal", "Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d676f555b673aa6d93c75d094a5885d8de32e304/166_0_3068_1842/master/3068.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8d60e7a30b2aafb74761d873558d0b66", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
