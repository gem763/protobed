It comes in the face of mounting evidence that he withheld crucial military aid to Ukraine \u2013 which is battling for its life against Russia \u2013 because he wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, along with a probe of alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe White House statement on the Middle East came less than 24 hours after Bill Taylor, the widely respected acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified that Trump had risked a key American national security goal \u2013 preventing Russia from dominating Ukraine \u2013 to advance his own personal political interests.\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony Tuesday was the most detailed and incriminating evidence to date about the central question of the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry: Did President Trump endanger the national security interests of the U.S. to advance his own reelection \u2013 what Washington calls a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d?\n\nTaylor, a West Point graduate and Vietnam war veteran who has served Republican and Democratic presidents for over 25 years, told members of Congress that in his view, Trump had done exactly that.\n\nThe president needed to shift public attention away from Taylor\u2019s devastating charges \u2013 and fast.\n\nSo as Trump was preparing to speak about Syria, a second stunt was staged. About two dozen of his ardent Republican supporters in the House literally stormed and occupied the sensitive compartmented information facility where impeachment depositions have been taken.\n\nBoth events are vintage Trump political hallmarks: in a crisis, deceive, deflect and distract.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks were replete with false claims, some of which were contradicted by his own senior officials. For instance, Trump said that he had decided to lift sanctions after Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised that the cease-fire along his border with Syria would become \u201cpermanent.\u201d\n\nCalling his much-criticized recent moves \u2013 made with little or no advance consultation with U.S. military or diplomats \u2013 a \u201cmajor breakthrough toward achieving a better future for Syria and for the Middle East,\u201d Trump said that his decisions would save \u201ctens of thousands of Kurdish lives.\u201d\n\nBut only a day earlier, Turkey (ostensibly a NATO member) and its emboldened new ally Russia (an American rival) endorsed a plan to push Syrian Kurdish fighters out of the newly created security zone.\n\nHow does letting Turkey and Russia control territory that only a month ago was held by American-backed Kurdish fighters advance their long-term interests or American national security? How does upending U.S. foreign policy by permitting Moscow and Tehran to expand their influence in the Arab Middle East strengthen U.S. security?\n\nMoreover, how permanent is the \u201cpermanent\u201d cease-fire Trump announced Wednesday? Even Trump acknowledged that the word \u201cpermanent\u201d was \u201cquestionable.\u201d So the president has lifted sanctions against Turkey before it\u2019s clear that the cease-fire will hold, and surely long before there is a permanent political settlement between the Kurds and Turkey.\n\nTrump also asserted that Kurdish Gen. Mazloum Abdi had assured him that the Islamic State fighters whom his formerly American-backed forces were holding would remain in captivity. But as he was speaking, America\u2019s top envoy to Syria was telling Congress that as many as 100 ISIS fighters had already escaped, and that Washington had little clue about where they were.\n\nTrump said that a \u201csmall number\u201d of U.S. soldiers would help safeguard Syrian oil facilities. How they would do that without the aid of now-alienated Kurdish forces is also unclear \u2013 even as Trump\u2019s top general in the Mideast was saying that the president would withdraw them all in a few months.\n\n\u201cWe are getting out,\u201d Trump said Wednesday, further muddying his earlier pronouncement about the fate of troop deployments in the Middle East. But the president made that claim after having sent 3,500 more troops to Saudi Arabia, part of the 14,000 additional troops he has sent to the Persian Gulf to counter Iranian attacks and provocations since May.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAt any given time, The New York Times reports, the U.S. has between 45,000 and 65,000 troops in the Middle East. Are they all coming home? And if so, how is this not a dangerous replay of President Barack Obama\u2019s disastrous decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq, which enabled ISIS to seize territory the size of Great Britain?\n\nAmericans are understandably weary of Middle Eastern wars and U.S. troops abroad. But it is the presence of 78,000 American troops in South Korea and Japan that has helped stabilize that vital region and prevent another war in the Korean peninsula.\n\nIn Europe, it is the presence of some 35,000 U.S. troops \u2013 4,500 of whom Trump\u2019s administration deployed in the past year \u2013 that has helped deter Russian aggression.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs a result of what Trump called his \u201cgreat American victory\u201d Wednesday, President Bashar Assad of Syria is now stronger. Russian President Vladimir Putin is stronger. Turkey is now working with Russia to patrol Syria\u2019s border.\n\nAmerica is viewed as an untrustworthy partner by the Kurds, who helped destroy ISIS, for which Trump claims credit. Thanks to him, escaped Islamist militants can scheme and dream of restoring their caliphate and attacking New York again.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JUDITH MILLER", "description": "The president\u2019s announcement was intended to underscore the highly questionable benefits of his isolationist \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to foreign policy and his determination to end America\u2019s \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East.", "authors": ["Judith Miller", "A Fox News Contributor", "Is An Award-Winning Author", "An Adjunct Fellow At The Manhattan Institute", "A Contributing Editor Of Its Magazine", "City Journal.
