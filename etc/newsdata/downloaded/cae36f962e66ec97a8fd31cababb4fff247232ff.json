Rashida Tlaib of Michigan introduced a resolution in favor of impeachment in late March with just a few cosponsors, but the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report from his nearly two-year-long investigations and its aftermath increased the appetite for impeaching Trump and the recent whistleblower complaint also put pressure on Democrats.\n\nMueller's report did not come to a \"traditional prosecutorial decision\" as to whether Trump obstructed the Mueller probe and other federal investigations involving him, but laid out 11 possible incidents of obstruction and left it to Congress to decide.\n\nThe fervor for impeachment has only intensified as the Trump administration ramped up its stonewalling of Congress' attempts to investigate Trump since the report's release.\n\nRead more: The DOJ agreed to turn over key evidence from Mueller's obstruction case one day before a scheduled contempt vote against AG William Barr\n\nOn May 29, Mueller gave a press conference at the DOJ announcing his formal resignation, re-iterating the conclusions of his report's findings, and declining to voluntarily testify before Congress.\n\nMueller made it explicitly clear that the report did not exonerate Trump, and that his office had no ability to charge Trump with a crime given existing DOJ policy prohibiting prosecutors from indicting a sitting president \u2014 leaving the next steps up to Congress.\n\nDemocratic leaders came under more pressure to consider impeachment when Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, a former Republican turned Independent, risked his seat and his political career to call for impeaching Trump.\n\nHere are the 180 currently-serving House Democrats and other major Dems who have openly come out in favor of beginning an impeachment inquiry against Trump.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that the House would pursue an official impeachment inquiry into Trump amid the whistleblower scandal.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta", "Rosie Perper", "Lauren Frias"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d5402b3cd978429181e78e5-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
