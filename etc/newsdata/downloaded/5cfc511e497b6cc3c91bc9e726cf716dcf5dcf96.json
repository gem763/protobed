Every time she called from her new home in a different city, they would conjure different excuses.\n\nEventually, an uncle was assigned the unenviable task of telling her.\n\nIn addition to extensive police investigations, the family placed adverts in newspapers and sent out search parties to comb the streets. They checked ditches in case he had been the victim of a hit and run, and even consulted Muslim spiritual priests, known as malams.\n\nIn time, her father asked the family to accept that their brother was dead - they had done the best they could.\n\nThe scream\n\nFirdausi refused to give up. She dedicated her university thesis to her missing brother and a year after graduating, she moved south to Lagos in search of work.\n\nShe converted to Christianity and started attending Winners Chapel - one of Nigeria's mega churches based in Ogun state just outside the city.\n\nEvery December, the church holds a five-day gathering of its members from all over the world.\n\nDuring the event, known as Shiloh, interested members of the congregation are allocated free stands to display their goods and services within the church premises.\n\nStill without a job in December 2000, Firdausi applied for a stand to sell some tie-dye fabrics her mother had made.\n\nWhile waiting for a carpenter to help set up the display, she sat on a chair and placed her head in her lap for some rest.\n\nThat was when she heard a beggar appealing, in the name of Allah, for spare change. Firdausi looked up.\n\nThis beggar had his hand firmly planted on the left shoulder of a boy who was dressed in a tattered brown tunic and undersized trousers.\n\nFirdausi screamed - the haggard boy guiding the beggar was her lost brother.\n\nThe kidnap\n\nSamuel, now aged 30, cannot recall exactly how he was stolen from his family: \"All I remember is the train journey.\"\n\nHe was taken to a one-armed woman who lived on the outskirts of Lagos in an area mostly occupied by disabled beggars.\n\nThe woman hired him out to blind beggars for 500 naira (approximately $5 or \u00a32.50 at the time) per day.\n\nThe sight of blind men and women being led around by boys and girls is common on many streets in Nigeria - especially in dense traffic where they usually tap on car windows, or around churches and mosques.\n\nOnly Samuel lived with the woman, sleeping on a mat in her shack.\n\nOver the years, he says about five others boys turned up to live with other women in the same yard, each hired out to blind beggars.\n\nSamuel suspects that something must have been done or given to him during that time because he does not recall ever thinking of his family during that period, or wondering what had become of them.\n\n\"I am not sure I had emotions then,\" he says. \"Just a zombie that knew he had to wake up and lead a beggar out. Make money, eat food and sleep, and the same routine the next day.\n\nLife of a slave\n\nDifferent beggars hired him for a period of anything from a week to a month.\n\nAt the end of each day, Samuel and the beggar slept alongside others in various public spaces.\n\nIf a beggar enjoyed working with him, they hired him again for another period.\n\n\"I was like a slave,\" he says. \"I couldn't say I wanted to go and do anything. I had to be around always.\"\n\nAs he was always on the move, Samuel made few friends, only occasionally playing with the children of other beggars he bumped into in the evenings.\n\nSometimes people gave them food while they were out begging. At other times they hung around restaurants and ate the leftovers or scavenged in dustbins.\n\n\"I was always hungry. During the daytime when you work, you hardly sit down to eat,\" he recalls.\n\n\"I didn't feel the beggars were bad. They wake up, beg, the way people wake up and go to work.\"\n\nDay after day, Samuel walked from one end of Lagos to the other with a beggar's right hand gripping his shoulder.\n\nSometimes, they trekked to neighbouring states or across the border to Benin. If the beggars received news of potential benefactors gathered somewhere, they told Samuel and he took them there by bus.\n\n\"There were times when you get so tired and you start bypassing people, but blind people are very sensitive - their hearing - so they pick up sound. Sometimes they would twist your shoulder and say: 'There is someone there. Why are you moving away?'\n\n\"They try to make as much money as they can.\"\n\nThe 'miracle'\n\nIn December 2000, a beggar he was guiding heard news of the programme at Winners Chapel where they ran into his sister.\n\nAt first, Firdausi was too shocked to reach out and touch her brother - who can still recall her scream.\n\n\"I fell down on the floor,\" she says.\n\nSamuel looked gaunt, his right shoulder was significantly tilted and he appeared dumb, not speaking a word. The sight caused Firdausi to burst into tears.\n\n\"It took a while but I knew that she was someone I knew - that this person was someone related to me,\" Samuel says.\n\nImage copyright @davidoyedepoministries Image caption David Oyedepo, founder of the Winners Chapel, held Samuel and prayed for him\n\nSoon a crowd gathered and drawn by the commotion, church officials also arrived. They managed to make sense of Firdausi's barely coherent joy and decreed that it was a \"miracle\" worth sharing with the entire congregation.\n\nThey ferried Samuel to a corner and gave him a quick wash. They found him fresh clothes to wear and rushed them both to the stage of the 50,000-seat auditorium where Firdausi was given a microphone.\n\nIn tears, she narrated how she had just found her brother who had been missing for six years.\n\nFirdausi recalls how the entire congregation leapt out of their chairs in shouts of praise and thanksgiving.\n\nThe founder of the church, David Oyedepo, then held Samuel and prayed for him.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThat night they slept on the church premises in a car, as it was a long way to get back to where Firdausi lived.\n\nShe remembers waking up throughout the night and touching her brother to make sure he was real.\n\nThe recovery\n\nToday Firdausi says that she regrets being so engrossed in finding her brother that she did not try to rescue the others from where he was kept.\n\nShortly before his rescue, a new young child had arrived in the yard, Samuel says.\n\nAt first, the boy wept non-stop and refused to eat. Suddenly, he became silent, leading Samuel to suspect that something had been done or given to the boy to quieten him.\n\nImage copyright Firdausi Okezie Image caption Samuel pictured with his sister on the day of her wedding, about two years after she found him\n\n\"In a developed country, you would just go and tell the police. But, here, the police would ask you to give them money for fuel and all that, and I didn't even have a job,\" Firdausi says.\n\nBesides, reintegrating her 13-year-old brother into normal life was proving more difficult than she had imagined. He had not returned to live with his father and she was taking care of him.\n\nBoils and rashes had broken out all over his body, giving off a foul stench.\n\nHis right shoulder remained bent for more than a year, requiring X-rays and physiotherapy before it finally stopped showing signs of the pressure from years of being gripped by beggars.\n\nTheir mother did not recognise the youngest of her seven children - who was now rough and haggard.\n\nShe had to raise his arm and search for a birthmark before she finally believed that the person in front of her was actually her son.\n\nThe student\n\nAfter six years of no formal education, Samuel was barely literate.\n\nFirdausi was left frustrated with the search for a school - with many saying he was too old to join at primary level.\n\nJust when she had almost lost hope, Firdausi met a school proprietor who had seen them on the stage at the church.\n\nThe woman agreed to admit him, while Firdausi made arrangements for additional private classes.\n\nImage copyright Samuel Abdulraheem Image caption Samuel Abdulraheem excelled at his studies\n\nIn three months, Samuel zoomed from primary one to primary four. Within a year, he had passed the entrance exams to secondary school.\n\nSamuel spent only three years in secondary school when, aged 17, he felt confident enough to sit for university entrance exams.\n\nHe passed with flying colours, attaining the best result in his entire school, and gained admission to study chemical engineering at the Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria.\n\nBut Samuel's academic prowess would eventually lead to the sudden end to his studies.\n\nOther students often sought his assistance with assignments and he was expelled during his fourth year after being caught writing another student's answers during exams.\n\n'No grudges'\n\nSamuel now works as a supervisor on construction sites.\n\n\"Someday when I am comfortable financially, I hope to continue my education,\" he says, adding that computer science might be an option as he is good with gadgets.\n\nSamuel Abdulraheem If anyone asks for money, I'd rather buy them food. Because, back then, it was better giving me food than money because the money went to the beggar and none came to me\"\n\nSamuel holds no ill feelings about what he went through while in captivity. He believes that all those years shaped him and taught him to try to always be nice to people.\n\n\"Nothing that people do actually gets to me. I just see it as a way of life. I don't hold grudges,\" he says.\n\nMemories of the constant hunger have affected the way he relates to beggars and their guides today. He never gives them money.\n\n\"I'd rather buy them food. Because, back then, it was better giving me food than money because the money went to the beggar and none came to me.\"\n\nSamuel hopes that, by sharing his story, people will pay more attention to beggars and the children who often guide them.\n\n\"When they see a beggar with someone, they should have a second thought that, possibly, this child could need help,\" he says. \"Don't just see and give money and walk away.\"\n\nIllustrations by the BBC's Manuella Bonomi", "description": "How a seven-year-old was stolen from his home in Nigeria and the chance encounter with his sister six years later.", "authors": ["Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F08A/production/_106987516_beggar-1976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-18"}
