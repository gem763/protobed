The town is at threat from the dam wall collapse at the nearby Toddbrook Reservoir PA\n\nOn a sunny day, it is easy to see why there is a flood (no pun intended) of visitors arriving.\n\nThe place \u2013 population 6,000 \u2013 is as picturesque as any of its more famed Peak District neighbours, Buxton, Bakewell and Edale included. There are good pubs, quaint cafes, independent shops and art galleries \u2013 as well as all-important chippy \u2013 dotting the higgledy-piggledy streets. Both the Peak Forest Canal and River Goyt run through the valley. The walking on the hills offers unrivalled views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been a lovely place,\u201d Cllr Thomas, who has lived here 35 years, tells The Independent. \u201cBut perhaps it\u2019s been a bit of a secret. The difference now is that it suddenly has a national profile. People have seen it is on the news, and they\u2019ve come along to have a look for themselves.\u201d\n\nVisitors are intrigued by what happened, too, the 65-year-old reckons. Many ask about those seven August days when emergency workers, engineers and a now famous RAF Chinook helicopter worked around the clock to secure the failing Toddbrook Reservoir. Plenty walk through Memorial Park to see the towering 188-year-old dam itself.\n\n\u201cAs a story, it has everything,\u201d Cllr Thomas says. \u201cNear disaster, heroism and a community pulling together. No-one\u2019s saying visitors come just to look at the dam \u2013 although it is impressive \u2013 but, if they\u2019re looking to spend a day in the Peak District, they are now considering Whaley Bridge in a way they didn\u2019t before.\u201d\n\nCertainly, there is much evidence to support the claim.\n\nThe not-for-profit Footsteps community caf\u00e9 in Market Street \u2013 which Cllr Thomas is a director of \u2013 has taken more than \u00a32,000 since it reopened on 8 August, after the evacuation ended. In the same period last year, that figure was just \u00a3804. A display in its window showing pictures of the dam and the rescue effort, meanwhile, has proven so popular the photographer has turned the images into a commemorative book. An initial run of 75 sold out within days. More than 400 have since been bought.\n\n\u201cPeople like the helicopter pictures,\u201d shruggs manager Anne Leyland, 77, when I ask about the book\u2019s popularity. \u201cThey want to remember how it looked, up there in the sky.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They say they want to help by spending their money here, which is such a moving gesture.\u201d\n\nMs Douglas-Mullett, a mother-of-two who has lived here for two years, had her parents visit from their native Dorset not long after the near collapse. \u201cOne of the first things my dad asked was to see the dam,\u201d she says.\n\nLittle Fika, itself, has doubled its takings in August compared to July \u2013 although it did lose nearly \u00a3500 of fresh food during the evacuation.\n\nNearby at Jarva Gallery in Market Street, owner Lyndsey Selley doesn\u2019t have sales figures but reckons footfall in her art and jewellery store is massively up over the past three weeks.\n\nIt seems, I suggest, like a little disaster might be a good idea every summer?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our nerves could stand it,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut, as a business community, the challenge now is to build on what\u2019s happened and make sure we take advantage of the raised profile.\u201d\n\nA meeting with just this end in mind took place last week between local traders, High Peak Borough Council, Derbyshire County Council and Marketing Peak District and Derbyshire.\n\nThe decisions taken have been criticised as a little lightweight \u2013 an online video is to be made and, if funding can be found, new signs installed and old ones improved \u2013 but Lindsay Rae, deputy director of Marketing Peak District and Derbyshire, reckons the benefits can be long-term.\n\n\u201cWe now have to work hard to capitalise by making sure every visitor here leaves with the best possible impression so they go away and tell their friends, who then also visit,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason this can\u2019t be self-perpetuating.\u201d\n\nCertainly, that\u2019s also the hope of John Wakeham, owner of Springbank Guest House in Reservoir Road.\n\nHe says he\u2019s had cancellations from holiday-makers now apparently apprehensive about staying in a town which sits under a vast 19th century reservoir \u2013 but that such drop-outs have been matched by last-minute bookings from visitors who, it seems, do want to stay in exactly such a place.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a six and two-threes for us,\u201c he says. \u201cNo business wants cancellations, but they\u2019ve mainly been evened out by the new guests. We can\u2019t complain. I suppose the whole things has made Whaley unique.\u201d\n\nNot everyone has benefited, it should be said.\n\nThe week-long closure forced by the evacuation inevitably meant lost money, while house prices are understood to have fallen in the aftermath. Several sales have collapsed.\n\nThere is some anger, too, at the Canal and River Trust, which manages the reservoir. Residents are asking why inspections did not reveal potential issues with the dam \u2013 a question currently being addressed, the trust says, in an independent inquiry.\n\nThe reservoir itself, meanwhile, will stay shut for an estimated three years while the wall is fixed, the cost of which could run into tens of millions of pounds.\n\nBut for now, back at Footsteps cafe, Cllr Thomas remains sure the long-term positives of the collapse will outweigh the negatives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve walked through the place the last few week and the shops are bursting at the seems, the sun is shining, the community is out spending money with each other,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been wonderful to see. Whatever happens now, it\u2019s been a summer no-one will forget.\u201d", "description": "It is the Derbyshire town which, just four weeks ago, was hours from being wiped off the map.
