However, nobody expressly forbids people from trading in cryptocurrencies, as long as they\u2019re not treated as legal tender.\n\nThanks to all the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies lately, understanding how to buy and sell Bitcoin in India is critical for everyone who wants to take part in it.\n\nThere are several ways to buy, sell or spend Bitcoin in India:\n\nOn a local or international exchange (read more about choosing one here)\n\nBy finding a local dealer on a marketplace like Localbitcoins.com and buying bitcoins from them with cash, credit card, via PayPal, etc.\n\nBy buying or selling goods or services for bitcoins.\n\nIf you would like to buy Bitcoin with cash, this can also be done by visiting the nearest Bitcoin ATM. However, at the moment there are no Bitcoin ATM\u2019s operating in India (according to CoinATMRadar.com).\n\nHow to buy or sell bitcoin in India using an exchange\n\nUsing a cryptocurrency exchange is one of the most popular and convenient ways to buy and sell bitcoin. However, due to bank-imposed (RBI) restrictions, you might not be able to fund your crypto exchange account using Indian banks. The situation has significantly affected the country\u2019s crypto landscape, even forcing to shut down some native cryptocurrency exchanges. Despite the RBI crackdown, it is still possible to buy and sell bitcoins in India.\n\nUncoin exchange in India.\n\nThe leading Indian Bitcoin exchanges are Bitbns, Unocoin, and Koinex. Unfortunately, Unocoin does not allow for INR deposits and withdrawals at the moment, but it is possible if you use Koinex and Bitbns.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to use Bitbns, you will need to verify your account with Aadhar and PAN card to connect your bank account and deposit or withdraw cash to/from your Bitbns wallet. With Koinex, all you need to do is register on the exchange, verify your account and fund it via Loop - an Indian platform for P2P INR trades.\n\nOnce you have bitcoin, you can also use other international exchanges to trade it or sell it. The most popular ones are:\n\nBinance\n\nCoinbase\n\nHitBTC\n\nChangelly\n\nCEX.IO\n\nCoinmama\n\nBuy or sell bitcoin in India via peer-to-peer platforms (P2P)\n\nNot every bitcoin user is satisfied with the level of anonymity and security provided by online crypto exchanges. Despite their convenience, bitcoin trading remains largely popular in the peer-to-peer platforms, as they tend to offer their users more in terms of privacy and freedom.\n\nLocalBitcoins trading volume in India.

Once you register on the platform, you post an ad or search for local people/institutions who want to buy or sell bitcoins via your preferred methods and for your preferred price. Once you find a suitable buyer/seller, you agree on the terms of the transaction (bank transfer, Paypal, face-to-face meeting, cash, etc.). Note that not every seller is trustworthy, so be sure to check their history and reviews beforehand.\n\nPaxful trading volume in India.

It works in a similar manner.\n\nBesides LocalBitcoins and Paxful, you can try decentralized P2P Bitcoin exchanges like Bisq and Cryptonex.\n\nBisq decentralizing trading platform.\n\nBisq stands out from other exchanges mentioned above, as it is a decentralized crypto exchange that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies (including bitcoin) without registration.\n\nCryptonex is another P2P crypto platform which lets you instantly exchange cryptocurrencies, INR, and other currencies using your credit/debit card. However, unlike Bisq, the service is not anonymous, and the onboarding process plus KYC/AML verification takes more time.\n\nLast but not least, you can try to buy and sell bitcoins in India using a service like WazirX. Although the platform is still in beta, it includes both crypto-to-crypto exchange and peer-to-peer trading service which lets trade INR for Tether (USDT) cryptocurrency.\n\nBuying or selling goods and services for bitcoin in India\n\nIf you don't want to or can't purchase or sell bitcoin using the methods mentioned above, you can obtain or use your bitcoins for goods and services. Although you won't be able to spend your bitcoins wherever you like, you can check websites like Coinmap.org to discover the bitcoin-friendly services.\n\nBitcoin-friendly merchants in India.

But don't forget to check with legal authorities how you can do so according to the law.\n\nSee our other guide for more information about how to accept bitcoin as a business.\n\nThese are the methods you can use to buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC) in India. Although currently there are no Bitcoin ATM\u2019s in the country, there are plenty of alternatives for how you can get BTC.\n\nDespite the unwelcome regulatory climate, more and more innovative Indian Bitcoin trading platforms are emerging, thus sparking a new wave of financial freedom, censorship-resistance, and entrepreneurship in India.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/guides/0//", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
