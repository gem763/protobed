The company released a signature sneaker for him, the Nike Tech Trainer Antonio Brown, last February.\n\nThe NFL is currently investigating allegations made by Brown\u2019s former personal trainer, who filed a civil lawsuit earlier this month accusing Brown of sexual assault and rape during a series of incidents in 2017 and 2018. Days later, Brown faced a second allegation after an unnamed artist told \"Sports Illustrated\" that he exposed himself to her while she worked on a mural Brown had commissioned for a Pittsburgh-area home.\n\nBrown also lost an endorsement deal with helmet maker Xenith, who cut ties with the Patriots star just days after the partnership was announced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a recent interview with Complex, Brown said he was \u201cgetting a huge Nike deal, which is opening up leverage for a lot of other guys and a lot of up-and-coming players to get in the marketing world and making money off the field.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old wide receiver made his debut for the Patriots last Sunday, catching four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown.
