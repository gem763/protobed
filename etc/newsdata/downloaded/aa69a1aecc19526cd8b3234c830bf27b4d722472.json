It said \"there are thousands of GM families and their communities -- and many thousands more at our dealerships and suppliers -- counting on us for their livelihood.\"\n\nFord F Fiat Chrysler FCAU The union had earlier extended the contracts at two other US automakers with UAW contracts,and, as it targeted GM in an effort to reach a deal that would set a pattern for the industry. Dittes' letter said that while membership will keep working for the time being, there would be no long-term extension of the contract at GM.\n\nTalks were continuing Saturday evening leading up to the midnight deadline. But Dittes' letter to GM said that the union's executive board would meet at midnight, ahead of the separate union meeting scheduled later on Sunday morning.\n\nAll three automakers are dealing with slower sales and the need to make huge multi-billion-dollar investments in developing electric and self-drivin g vehicles that have more long-term potential than current market demand.\n\nTo save money for those efforts, GM has already halted operations at three US plants -- two transmission factories and an assembly line in Lordstown, Ohio . It plans to shut another assembly line in Detroit, its last Detroit factory, early next year.\n\nThe UAW has vowed to win GM's agreement at the negotiating table to keep all or at least some of those plants operating.\n\nBut negotiations took place as the union is hit by a scandal involving misappropriation of union funds, and in some cases, union officials accepting bribes from officials at Fiat Chrysler. Nine people associated with the union or Fiat Chrysler have already pleaded guilty to federal charges.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Detroit News reported the union's president, Gary Jones, was the unnamed union official identified in the most recent indictment as \"UAW Official A.\" The union has not responded to a request for comment about that report.\n\nExperts say the scandal will make it more difficult to get rank and file union members at the automakers to ratify any tentative deal reached by union leadership. Four years ago the deals all passed by only narrow margins, even though there was no scandal at that time.\n\nDziczek said the two meetings of union leadership scheduled for Sunday is unusual at this stage of negotiations. It could be a sign of the the strain that the scandal is putting on the union leadership during these talks.\n\n\"It insures whatever is decided, there is buy-in. And they need that,\" she said.", "description": "Members of the United Auto Workers union working at General Motors agreed Saturday night to stay on the job past a midnight deadline for a new contract, but remained on the verge of a strike.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190914171111-01-flint-gm-assembly-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
