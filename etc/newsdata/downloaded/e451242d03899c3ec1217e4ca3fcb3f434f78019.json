It emitted a red light. It entered our view from above and approached the yellow object.\n\n'The red object zoomed up to the yellow object, stopped and reversed, and then did it again as if to prompt a reaction. And it got one!'\n\nPhil said the yellow object took off in close pursuit of the red opponent.\n\n'They crossed the valley-head back and forth many times in a hectic paired chase,' he said.\n\n'Eventually the yellow one sped off at extraordinary speed to our right, and disappeared behind the hill.\n\n'The red one had also gone. Neither myself, nor my brother were certain whether the red one had followed or simply left.'\n\nA distinct 'bright yellow object' was spotted, which hovered about 50metres above ground level, before a second one appeared, emitting 'a red light' (stock image)\n\nPhil described his surroundings to have a few built houses and was sparsely treed, with clear night skies and no noise during the reported incident.\n\n'On this night, there was no noise, no car engines, just silence,' he said.\n\n'Not that this was unusual, there were fewer people in the hills back then. But there was no engine noise from this bobbing light at the end of our valley.'", "description": "Rob and Phil Tindale were just 10 years old when they saw two objects hovering in the skies outside their home in Sterling, Adelaide Hills in February 1980.", "authors": ["Paula Ahillon For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/10/19952370-0-image-a-19_1571565136449.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
