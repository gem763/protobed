A number said they were penalized for any \"time off task\" during the day, a term that referred to any breaks other than the legally required 30 minutes for lunch.\n\n\"Amazon, which has been criticized for its company culture in other cities, is running its Staten Island facility without regard for workers\u2019 need to be treated as people, not robots,\" report co-author Charlene Obernauer, the group's executive director, said in a statement.\n\nThe accounts are similar to complaints made by Amazon workers seeking to form labor unions in other parts of the country, a resemblance not lost on the Seattle-based company, which says it offers a high-quality work environment.\n\nThe New York report is a \"self-serving\" document produced by a union-led organization rather than a government agency and reflects a survey of less than 3 percent of the Staten Island workforce, an Amazon spokesperson told FOX Business. The company has 250,000 hourly employees, including more than 4,500 full-time workers in Staten Island.\n\nAccording to The New York Post, the labor groups involved in the report also helped derail Amazon\u2019s plan to put part of a second headquarters in New York, which would have created 25,000 jobs.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe authors of the occupational safety report made no effort to hide their pro-union sentiments. \"Amazon has a troubled record of worker safety and health violations in the United States\" that could be improved with a unionized workforce, slower operations and a comprehensive ergonomics program, they wrote.\n\nCurrently, Staten Island workers who spend too much time on activities other than assigned tasks \"may be disciplined and are ultimately subject to termination for poor performance,\" the group said.\n\nThe system results in a culture that prioritizes productivity and economic goals over human needs, according to the report.\n\nHealth professionals are calling the documented pain \"eye-opening.\"\n\nEmployees are \u201cforced to work at dangerous speeds to ensure the packages Americans order arrive quickly,\u201d Dr. David Michaels, former head of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and currently a professor at George Washington University's School of Public Health, said in the group's statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Shopping giant Amazon is coming under fire for a 'speed-obsessed culture' at its Staten Island distribution center in a new report released this week.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Amazon-grab-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
