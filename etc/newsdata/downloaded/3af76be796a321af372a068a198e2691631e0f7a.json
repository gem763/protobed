Even Greece Is Getting Paid to Borrow Money in Debt Markets\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Greece, the one-time bond-market pariah at the heart of Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis, just completed a transformative journey by joining the region\u2019s negative-yield club.\n\nInvestors are now paying for the privilege of lending it cash. A sale of 487.5 million euros ($535 million) of 13-week bills Wednesday drew a yield of minus 0.02%. Greece joins the likes of Ireland, Italy and Spain benefitting from the European Central Bank\u2019s supportive monetary policy and deepening fears of a global recession.\n\nIt\u2019s a stark turnaround for the euro area\u2019s most-indebted member, which was forced to accept the biggest bond restructuring in history in March 2012 as Greece\u2019s membership of the currency bloc came into doubt. Now the region is grappling with an altogether different problem -- the spread of negative yields, which reduces borrowing costs for governments but threatens to harm savers, pension funds and insurers.\n\nJon Day, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management, said the move was \u201canother symptom\u201d of the \u201cglobal grab for yield, especially in euro-denominated bonds,\u201d pointing out that short-dated Greek bonds were previously one of the few government markets where a positive return was on offer.\n\n\u201cThere remain substantial risks around Greece\u2019s financial position and it remains vulnerable to a significant economic slowdown,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrent yields on their bonds do not reflect this risk.\u201d\n\nThe trend for negative yields comes after the ECB cut interest rates deeper into negative territory and said it would restart its bond-buying economic stimulus known as quantitative easing. Investors are also looking toward fiscal stimulus as the ability of monetary policy to stoke growth is tested to its limits.\n\nGreece\u2019s government is forecasting 2.8% economic growth in 2020, which it says puts it on track to meet a budget target agreed with creditors while still enacting tax relief measures. The nation also took advantage of record-low borrowing costs by selling 10-year bonds this week at a yield of 1.5%.\n\n\u201cGreece issuing negative-yielding bills is more evidence of the positive effect that negative interest rates and QE has on debt sustainability for governments,\u201d said Peter Chatwell, head of European rates strategy at Mizuho International Plc in London. \u201cSide effects are large for banks and investors, but for the governments there are very significant benefits.\u201d", "description": "Even Greece Is Getting Paid to Borrow Money in Debt Markets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB660K5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
