REUTERS/David Brunnstrom/File Photo\n\nBusiness minister Andrea Leadsom\u2019s move on Wednesday is not unusual where there are potential security concerns and follows British government intervention in the pending acquisition of satellite group Inmarsat, by an international private equity consortium which includes U.S. firm Warburg Pincus.\n\nLeadsom has issued a European intervention notice, calling for a report from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) by Oct. 29 to determine whether Cobham, the maker of air-to-air refuelling equipment, should be sold.\n\nThe CMA could decide to undertake a lengthy inquiry due to Cobham\u2019s role in supporting aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Eurofighter Typhoon as well as advanced naval vessels, satellites and military vehicles.\n\nOther deals investigated on national security grounds have often been cleared after undertakings from the buyer.\n\n\u201cThe CMA will now prepare a report on the national security aspects of the proposed transaction,\u201d the business department said. \u201cThis is a statutory process to ensure national security implications of a proposed sale are fully assessed.\u201d\n\nOne of the most open economies in the world, Britain has sold some highly innovative firms to foreign buyers in recent years, including the semiconductor designer Arm to Japan\u2019s Softbank and pay-TV group Sky to Comcast.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange is trying to fend off a $39 billion takeover approach launched this month by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.\n\nSPECIAL STATUS\n\nCobham, launched in the 1930s by a British adventurer and explorer, employs 10,000 people. It has struggled in recent years, issuing a string of profit warnings in 2016 and 2017.\n\nAdvent has a track record in buying British technology, having snapped up electronics company Laird for $1.65 billion last year, and Cobham investors approved the takeover on Monday.\n\nSome Cobham operations, such as its Advanced Electronic Solutions unit, have special security agreement status that allows them to bid for U.S. defense contracts.\n\nCobham Chief Executive David Lockwood said on Monday that requirement would disappear under Advent ownership, enabling the group to combine infrastructure and share knowledge more quickly and easily within the company.\n\nLockwood said he had already held some discussions with government about the takeover but would not go into details.\n\n\u201cAdvent is committed to being a responsible steward of Cobham, encouraging its future growth and success,\u201d a spokesman for the U.S. group said. \u201cWe will continue to engage constructively and cooperatively with the UK Government in this part of their review.\u201d\n\nCobham shares slipped 0.5%, with the stock at 160 pence per share, just below the offer price of 165 pence.", "description": "Britain will investigate the national security impact of the purchase of defense company Cobham by U.S. private equity firm Advent International, potentially delaying or even blocking the $5 billion deal.", "authors": ["Kate Holton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431184786&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0IA-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
