It's sure to be a fascinating endeavour but it's one that has direct relevance to everyone on Earth.\n\nThe energetic outbursts from our star have the ability to damage satellites, harm astronauts, degrade radio communications, and even knock power grids offline.\n\n\"We're doing this not just for the sake of increasing our knowledge but also for being able to take precautions, for example by putting satellites in safe mode when we know big solar storms are coming or letting astronauts not leave the space station on these days,\" said Daniel M\u00fcller, the European Space Agency (Esa) project scientist on SolO.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Holly Gilbert: \"Knowledge even more important when we send astronauts to the Moon and Mars\"\n\nThe probe was assembled in Stevenage, UK, by Airbus (Britain has invested \u20ac220m in the \u20ac1.5bn project), with the past year spent here at the IABG facility in Ottobrunn, Germany, for testing.\n\nThe spacecraft has cleared its checks and will now ship out to Florida to be mated with the Atlas rocket that will hurl it towards the Sun in early February.\n\nSolO was first conceived in the late 1990s with the industrial contract to produce it awarded in 2012.\n\nA key challenge has been to mature technologies that can protect a probe that flies to within 43 million km of our star.\n\nTemperatures at this proximity will get up to 600 degrees.\n\nSolO's plan to survive these conditions involves hiding behind a large titanium shield, and cooling itself with a complex series of radiators.\n\nSophisticated fault-recovery systems will also ensure SolO stays out of trouble.\n\n\"If we de-point, we very quickly run into difficulty thermally,\" explained Airbus project manager Ian Walters.\n\n\"Our requirement is to make sure we recover under any failure scenario within 50 seconds and actually our spacecraft will go back to normal pointing in 22 seconds, all autonomously.\"\n\nImage copyright ESA - S. Corvaja Image caption The heatshield has peepholes to allow the telescopes to see the Sun\n\nBut the probe still needs to observe the star and to do that it must use peepholes in the shield.\n\nThese will briefly open to allow the telescopes to grab their observations before closing shut again.\n\nThe pictures and movies that come back will be unprecedented in their fine resolution.\n\nFeatures as small as 70km across will be visible.\n\n\"It's amazing; every time we get better resolution we see more and more,\" said Holly Gilbert, the US space agency's deputy project scientist on the mission.\n\n\"The interactions between the Sun's plasma (energetic gas) and its magnetic field are incredibly dynamic, not just on the large scales but on the very, very small scales.\n\n\"When the magnetic fields interact in a very explosive process called reconnection - that's a very small region.\n\n\"And to see how that leads to eruptions, we need to see the small stuff that's happening.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA/SDO\n\nOne of the major differences between this mission and all previous such ventures is that SolO will get to take the first close-up images of our star's polar regions.\n\nThe high latitudes are known to be significant locations for magnetic behaviour and the generation of the fastest outflows of particles.\n\n\"We've never seen the solar poles directly because from Earth we just have a very grazing view,\" said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auch\u00e8re, a mission principal investigator from the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale, Orsay, France.\n\n\"But these regions are very important because they are the source of the very fast solar wind and we also know that in the solar interior things are happening at the poles that may be the key to understanding solar activity and the solar cycle.\"\n\nSolO will be following the American Parker Solar Probe, which launched to space last year.\n\nThe pair share many of the same scientific goals and even the same kinds of instruments, although only SolO will look directly at the Sun.\n\nParker can't do that because it's venturing even closer to the star, a mere 6 million km at closest approach.\n\nIt uses just in-situ sensors, to sample for example the particles flowing over it. But scientists believe the duo when in the right position will make a powerful team in observing processes that initiate close in to the Sun but then propagate outwards.\n\n\"There are so many ways we can combine these spacecraft to get incredible science. The first serious opportunity will come in September next year,\" Tim Horbury, from Imperial College London, told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA-JHU-APL Image caption Artwork: Parker will work in tandem with SolO, but from much closer in\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "description": "A UK-assembled European spacecraft aims to take the closest ever pictures and movies of the Sun.", "authors": ["Jonathan Amos", "Bbc Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CE52/production/_109281825_vlcsnap-2019-10-18-09h46m10s317.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
