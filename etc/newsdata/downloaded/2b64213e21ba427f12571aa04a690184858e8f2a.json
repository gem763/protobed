Let me wait and (see if) it will be quiet.\"\n\nSouth Africa attracts people from neighbouring Lesotho, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Others come from further afield including Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria and south Asia.\n\nAkujinwa left his home city of Owerri in 2009, one year after a similar spate of xenophobic violence left 62 dead.\n\nHe remembered hearing the news but not thinking much about it.\n\n\"They said South Africans were fighting,\" said Akujinwa. \"We didn't even know that word, xenophobic.\"\n\nWith no qualifications, he sold fruit on the inner-city streets for three years before switching to phone repairs.\n\n\"When I arrived here I improved,\" said Akujinwa, recalling his journey.\n\n\"When you make a decision to go, job or no job, you find something.\"\n\nREAD | Nigeria's Buhari arrives in SA to meet with Ramaphosa in wake of xenophobic violence\n\nJohannesburg's crime-ridden business district is crammed with small foreign-owned stores like Akujinwa's, providing everything from household goods, electronic gadgets and tailor services.\n\nSeen as competing with locals for jobs, they are often the first under fire when South Africa's chronic unemployment, inequality and poverty boils into xenophobic outlash.\n\nAkujinwa had so far remained unscathed.\n\nAs business picked up, he moved to an apartment in Hillbrow - one of Johannesburg's most dangerous and deprived areas - where he has maintained good relations with his South African neighbours.\n\n\"We are like brothers and sisters. There is nothing like segregation or discrimination,\" he said.\n\n\"Black, white or coloured. I am with them there.\"\n\n'Let him come'\n\nAkujinwa felt settled enough in Johannesburg to invite his wife Gift to join him last year.\n\nThey moved to a bigger space in the same building and Gift recently gave birth to their first child.\n\n\"I fear for them (my family) because I am the head of the house,\" said Akujinwa, adding that the shop was shut for almost a week after the looting.\n\n\"I have to go out and look for something for them to eat.\"\n\nAkujinwa said people \"on the streets\" had more pressing concerns than Buhari's visit, which was initially planned to discuss trade and politics.\n\nBut he said he hoped his presence would push the South African government into helping those who have decided to stick it out in the country.\n\n\"If they discuss well, the Nigerians that (want) to stay here can stay,\" he said.", "description": "Reeling from a terrifying surge of unrest that saw his shop wrecked and plundered, Nigerian-born Alvan Akujinwa toyed with the possibility of leaving his adopted home of South Africa for the first time in 10 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7780/e468a08808fd40ebacb518e22401d019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
