But he was also noticeably slowing down and breathing heavy at the end of the second round.\n\nBetween rounds, Hardy (5-1 MMA, 2-1 UFC) took a hit from an inhaler. Then he went out and finished the third, and was originally awarded a unanimous decision on scores of 30-27 across the board. That result, however, was reversed and later ruled a no contest by the Massachusetts State Athletic Commission because of Hardy's inhaler use.\n\n\"I was in the ring. Me and my coach asked the commission if it would be OK to use my inhaler, and they said yes, so I took it,\" Hardy said. \"I'm still a new guy in this sport. I did what I do in every situation: I asked permission. I got permission, and I did what I was told.\"\n\nAccording to Yahoo! Sports' Kevin Iole, UFC president Dana White said use of the inhaler had been approved but that ultimately wasn't the case.\n\nHardy showed improved striking, footwork and pacing over the course of 15 minutes. He landed crisp jabs every time his smaller foe waded in, and he peppered Sosoli (7-2 MMA, 0-0 UFC) with kicks throughout the fight.\n\nSosoli \u2013 unlike some of Hardy's previous foes \u2013 didn't look intimidated and landed occasional heavy hands but he was never able to untrack any sustained offense.\n\nIt's the second controversial result for Hardy in the UFC. In his promotional debut back in January, Hardy was disqualified for throwing an illegal knee in a fight with Allen Crowder.\n\nHardy said post-fight that it was a \"ventolin albuterol inhaler for exercise-induced asthma\" that he's used his whole life. Hardy believes he did nothing wrong because he asked a Massachusetts State Athletic Commission official in the octagon if he could use the inhaler, citing U.S. Anti-Doping Agency approval.\n\nThat ultimately proved false, with Hardy\u2019s victory being changed to a no contest, much to his dismay.\n\n\u201cThe worst part is, here I am letting people down again,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sucky feeling. All I\u2019m trying to do is \u2013 we had a conversation before the fight, I\u2019m doing everything I\u2019m supposed to be doing. I asked permission, they told me I could, and I\u2019m in trouble again. My mind\u2019s on just make sure everyone is happy, making sure everything is cool because it\u2019s a crappy feeling...\n\n\"I just fought more time than I\u2019ve ever fought in my whole entire career, and we\u2019re sitting here talking about an inhaler that I\u2019ve used my whole entire life. That\u2019s a crappy feeling, dude. I never want to take away from the UFC brand. I never want to take away from anybody, and I feel like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, and I\u2019m not OK with that.\u201d\n\nUFC president Dana White said he understands how it happened but it's still on Hardy's corner to \"know you can\u2019t use an inhaler in the corner. They should know that. Shouldn\u2019t even be a question. You can drink water. It\u2019s pretty simple. Gatorade in some states.\u201d\n\nContributing: Mike Bohn", "description": "Greg Hardy used an inhaler during his fight with Ben Sosoli, and his unanimous decision win was changed to a no contest as a result.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/19/USAT/c82e8d67-8c01-4378-8760-eb4ef674a50f-USP_MMA__UFC_Fight_Night-Boston-Hardy_vs_Sosoli.JPG?crop=3396,1910,x0,y2&width=2865&height=1910&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
