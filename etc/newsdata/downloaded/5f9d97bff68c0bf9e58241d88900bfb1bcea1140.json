Suddenly, a patient will be talking more than they did earlier. They\u2019ll be directing the conversation, not the doctor. It\u2019s as if the mutual agreement to pause for two seconds spilled into an agreement to shift roles.\n\nRead: The incredible thing we do during conversations\n\n\u201cNo, for some reason I guess I just in my head was gonna be on [chemotherapy] for the rest of my life and everything was gonna be hunky dory and \u2026\u201d a patient begins.\n\nA 2.9-second connectional silence follows. The doctor inhales audibly, to signal they will respond, which makes the patient pick back up.\n\n\u201cYou know. I knew early on, I mean you told me early on, it\u2019s not like and then this will be the rest of my life. Something, you know, might go down.\u201d\n\nThe doctor responds. \u201cSomething. That can be a very hard thing to think about. That here we found something that\u2019s helping but you can\u2019t stay on it for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nIn other moments, the silence comes after a doctor has said something empathetic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare of me to tell somebody point blank you\u2019ve got to stop. However, I will say you have my permission to set limits,\u201d the doctor says.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says the patient, then falls silent for nearly seven seconds.\n\nHis wife chuckles. \u201cHe can\u2019t stand the thought of it. I can tell by his laugh,\u201d then she laughs.\n\n\u201cI know he can\u2019t stand the thought of it,\u201d the doctor says.\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay,\u201d the patient says. \u201cI\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nOr in another instance, the doctor tells a patient\u2019s spouse, \u201cWhat you feel is really hard. It\u2019s really hard.\u201d There\u2019s a 2.8-second silence.\n\n\u201cI just wish he had a better quality of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d says the doctor.\n\nEven though these connectional silences don\u2019t happen often, Gramling thinks they\u2019re good linguistic markers of connection exactly because doctors don\u2019t commonly use them. When someone good at monologuing and interrupting falls silent, it may mean they\u2019re allowing something else to happen.\n\nGramling surmises, \u201cMore often than not, the conversations that have a lot of space in them are probably going to lead to people feeling more heard and understood.\u201d\n\nJudy had a question. Having come to the hospital at the University of Vermont to recover from the flu, this elegant, 83-year-old woman was lying in her bed. Two doctors had come to her room bearing news. It was cancer, not the flu, and it had spread from her liver. She could undertake a course of chemo, or she could have her pain managed as she died.\n\nShe turned to her daughter, Kate, sitting beside her. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d she asked.\n\nWhen the doctors had requested this meeting, Kate had dropped everything to be there. It seemed unusually serious. Now she knew why. She wondered why she hadn\u2019t seen the signs of her mother\u2019s cancer. Judy\u2019s skin had started to look yellow, she recalled. But instead of recommending a checkup, she bought her mother some pinker makeup.", "description": "Could AI teach doctors when to stop talking?", "authors": ["Michael Erard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/249_DyingWords_Mosaic_Anthony_Gerace_2/facebook.jpg?1566944647"}
