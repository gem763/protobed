China rose from 51st to 19th over the same timeframe.\n\n\"It's not going in the right direction,\" Professor Holden said. \"We should think about how we diversify.\"\n\nThe academic economist, though, said it was logical for Australia \u2013 which has a small population far from its trading partners \u2013 to concentrate on specific products and accept that advanced manufacturing, even by Australian companies, would occur overseas.\n\nRather than direct government support, Professor Holden said he believed in better training of the workforce, easier access to business capital, and an immediate cut in the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent, from 30 per cent for the biggest companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Twenty years ago we had one of the lowest [corporate tax rates] in the OECD,\" he said. \"Now we have one of the highest.\"\n\nThe Coalition government dropped plans to cut income taxes for all companies last year because of political opposition.\n\nOvershadowed\n\nEconomists said Australia's huge sales of iron coal, coal, gas and oil overseas overshadowed many other parts of the economy, which were thriving without government assistance.\n\n\"We have lost some manufacturing,\" said Warren Hogan, a professor at the University of Technology Sydney business school. \"But in a way the success [of the resources industry] has made the others look insignificant.\"\n\nProfessor Hogan said subsidies for the car-making industry, including General Motors and Ford, had made them less viable by discouraging job-replacing robots. The subsidies were ended by the Abbott government.\n\nBut the former chief economist at ANZ Banking Group said he supported the government examining some kind of help for industries that could grow from existing areas of strength, including food manufacturing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There are reasons why we stopped supporting vehicle manufacturing,\" he said. \"There are other industries that warrant a closer look.\"\n\nIndustry Minister Karen Andrews said a lot of the expertise and high-tech capability from mining could be applied to other industries. She cited a $25 million government investment in battery research, which is based on knowledge of critical minerals.\n\n\"My priority is to bring science and technology together with Australia\u2019s strong and growing industries \u2013 like advanced manufacturing, mining and agri-business \u2013 to create jobs and grow competitive businesses for the future,\" she said.\n\nThe research triggered passionate debate on social media about the decline of Australian industry.\n\nSome people criticised the Harvard analysis, which lumped Australia with many developing economies even though it was ranked 8th for prosperity out of 133 nations.\n\n\"Does anyone really want to swap spots with the Czech Republic? Slovenia? Italy?\" tweeted Motley Fool chief investment officer Scott Phillips. \"Because the boffins at Harvard say they rank higher. Spare me!\"\n\nOthers complained that many scientists, engineers and other professionals are employed in the resources industries, and it was unfair to say they were created without degrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrency high\n\nSome experts pointed out that strong prices for coal and iron ore had driven up the dollar, adding to the challenges of manufacturing products in Australia for sale to the rest of the world.\n\n\"We are not particularly entrepreneurial as a nation,\" said AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver.\n\n\"We come up with great ideas but unfortunately during the innovation phase, which involves getting those ideas to a point where they can be commercially used, they end up overseas because the financing isn't available. That sort of compounds the problem.\"\n\nThe Harvard database is run by a program led by economist Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuela minister of planning.", "description": "A study that portrays Australia as rich and dumb is based on a false premise, economists say and is not necessarily an indicator of good terms of trade.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0681%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_205/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/90dce1b55576ff27c6eafb3c712ad751cf18f4a2", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
