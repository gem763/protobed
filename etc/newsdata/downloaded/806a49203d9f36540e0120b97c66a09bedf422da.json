And if I look at the political image of the Democratic Party over the last 50 years of my life since I was 5, and very little has changed for my community, then I have some questions \u2014 I got more than questions--I have empirical evidence that something is wrong.\"\n\nWashington, a supporter of the #WalkAway movement, also said he believes he\u2019s not alone.\n\n\u201cYou got a lot of conservative or centric libertarian-minded people that really care about other people, but they are terrified to come out of the closet and say anything that\u2019s not in line with the Democratic Party,\u201d Washington told \u201cNuff Said.\u201d\n\nIn April, Washington explained on Twitter his political heart started to change when President Trump invited him to the White House to celebrate the First Step Act.\n\nI voted for 44 twice. I even checked my emails in his Senate Office while lobbying for Salone to be given another chance to rebrand. Not once in 8 years was I given any support regarding Africa or the Black Agenda, but 45 invites me to the WH to celebrate the #FirstStepAct ??????? \u2014 Isaiah Washington (@IWashington) April 1, 2019\n\nHe boiled the interview down to one line: \"I'm going to support the policy, not the person.\"\n\nNot only has he fallen away from the Democratic Party at large, on Twitter this week he was also very critical of black Democrats, specifically, comparing them to dating a crack addict.\n\n\"I dated a woman that was addicted to crack,\" he explained. \"I became addicted to trying to save her. She stole from me and disappeared for days, worrying me to death. I really loved her and when I tried to reason with her to get her help, she refused, berated & attacked me much like Black Dems.\"", "description": ".09/06/2019 8:06:27AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/249/7035346b-cd9b-4efe-939f-8836ac48a0c6.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
