YouTube Music is kicking Google Play Music aside as Android\u2019s prepackaged music player, YouTube announced Saturday. The app will come bundled with all devices launching with Android 10.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Google Play Music stan, don\u2019t worry though: Just because it doesn\u2019t come preloaded like in previous versions doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gone for good.\n\n\u201cMusic listeners with new Android 10 devices can continue to enjoy Google Play Music by downloading it from the Play Store and logging in to their accounts,\u201d YouTube Music\u2019s product manager Brandon Bilinski wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe app will also be bundled with new devices shipping with Android 9.\n\nGoogle\u2019s talked about this switchover since YouTube Music launched in 2015, and the service\u2019s design overhaul last year seemed to hint that Google Play Music\u2019s days might be numbered. For all of Google\u2019s other industry knockouts, its music player never quite racked up the same kind of cultural clout or user base as competitors like Spotify and Apple Music. Meanwhile, YouTube has maintained a strong foothold as a kind of de facto music streaming platform for many of its billion-plus users, and their viewing histories are automatically carried over to YouTube Music.\n\nWhile the player itself is free, a premium subscription will set you back around $15 a month, or you can get it bundled with a YouTube Premium subscription for $18 per month. It comes with the perks you\u2019d expect from a music streaming service subscription: no ads, downloadable playlists, etc.\n\nWhile Google has slowly been migrating features from its original music player to YouTube Music, its interface still feels a bit clunky compared to what you\u2019d find with rival services. Though it\u2019s still a huge improvement compared to its debut design, which took few notes from Spotify\u2019s successful formula.\n\nUsers who currently house their tunes on Google Play Music are uneasy about the switch as well. If it does eventually get the ax, there\u2019s no timeline as of yet explaining how or if any of this data would be transferred over. According to Tom\u2019s Guide, the two service\u2019s music libraries and features don\u2019t match up perfectly either.\n\nWe reached out to Google to see what\u2019s up on that front and will update this with their response.", "description": "It looks like Google\u2019s dessert-themed naming scheme isn\u2019t the only thing getting replaced with Android 10.
