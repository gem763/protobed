This will block all trackers associated with Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube.\n\nAmong other notable updates, there\u2019s also a new Privacy Protections report that acts as a handy dashboard of the trackers Firefox has blocked, broken down by type. The browser\u2018s Lockwise password management tool has also been integrated with Firefox Monitor to warn you if your saved logins have been compromised in a data breach.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Firefox alone. Earlier this month, Google baked its Password Checkup tool right into Google account controls. With Chrome 78, which was released yesterday, the company is officially bringing the feature to the browser.\n\nThe option is not enabled by default, but you can turn it on by visiting: chrome://flags/#password-leak-detection.\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that both Chrome and Firefox\u2018s breach notification tools will only work if you\u2019re syncing your stored passwords to the respective services.\n\nStill, the addition is a sign that browser makers are taking security more seriously by actively addressing the need for breach alerts given the alarming frequency and scale of data breaches.\n\nRead next: Private Chinese space company aims to rival SpaceX with a reusable rocket by 2021", "description": "Mozilla and Google add password breach notification tools natively into Firefox and Chrome browsers respectively in the latest update.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F09%2Ffirefox-hed.png&signature=438115b2a8b1bc9dc94ce976dcd0e561", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
