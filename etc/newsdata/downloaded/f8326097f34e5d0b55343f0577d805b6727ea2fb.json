Tim Scott, South Carolina Republican; Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat; and Mike Braun, Wisconsin Republican, introduced the measure Thursday.\n\n\u201cHaving grown up in neighborhoods that would have benefited from school choice, I know firsthand the amazing opportunities that can be opened for children when they\u2019re afforded that opportunity,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cI have visited multiple schools in Washington that utilize the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program and know for a fact that parents and students see it as an absolute blessing. I look forward to permanently authorizing the SOAR Act and continuing to open doors for some of our most overlooked communities.\u201d\n\nNow, I can imagine some of you shaking your heads and saying, \u201cHere the federal government goes again, dipping into local and state education matters that are better in the hands of parents and other taxpayers on a local level.\u201d\n\nBut know this: The unions already are busting bouncing from city to city and state capitol to state capitol gearing up for their anti-school choice battle royale for 2020.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, earned her big public smooch in Chicago, where striking teachers are refusing to enter schoolhouses and classrooms because they want more money and benefits. They even rejected a 16% raise.\n\nUnfortunately, Chicago Public Schools students will feel the brunt of the costly demands if they leave school without a diploma \u2014 or with a diploma but so academically deprived they can only look forward to jobs whose \u201cHelp wanted\u201d signs say nerds and geeks need not apply.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Warren, a former special ed teacher, stood among the throng of Chicago\u2019s striking teachers and alongside American Federal of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and said this: \u201cI\u2019m here to stand for America\u2019s public schools. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago\u2019s teachers. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago nurses. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago\u2019s librarians. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago\u2019s bus drivers. I\u2019m here to stand with the low wage workers in the Chicago schools.\n\n\u201cI also am here to stand with our unions. To stand with SEIU, to stand with CTU, and here\u2019s why \u2014 because the unions are how we have a voice. The unions are how we have power.\u201d\n\nThe truth is that Ms. Warren would have gained a measure of respect had she said \u201cI\u2019m here to stand with children,\u201d because it\u2019s children who deserve her time and attention and it\u2019s children who will, at some point, have to pay the salaries and benefits of future teachers, presidents and members of Congress.\n\nAs I mentioned in an earlier column, the Democratic presidential contenders \u2014 and the media who question them in the debates \u2014 aren\u2019t probing education, education reform or the plethora of options provided by academic achievement.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Ms. Warren released her so-called education plan.\n\nUnfortunately, it reads like a mash-up of union rhetoric, socialist diatribe and post-separate-but-unequal promises.\n\nNow that Ms. Warren has set the bar, it\u2019ll be interesting to see what Joe Biden, Corey Booker and Tulsi Gabbard have as comebacks \u2014 and see whether they stand with parental school choice or opt to be slobbered upon with union kisses.\n\nKeep in mind, though, the Warren bar is mighty low. However, it has a ZIP code \u2014 and it is 20001.\n\n\u2981 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
