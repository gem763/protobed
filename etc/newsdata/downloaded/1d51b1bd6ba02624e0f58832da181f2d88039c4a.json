It was one of the most difficult challenges in my life and you had one day off per month.\n\nThe former left-back spent eight years at Old Trafford, making almost 400 appearances\n\n'They control everything, they force you to eat at the club and I learned a lot at the club, also tactically.\n\n'Juventus were one of my biggest challenges and I'm so proud I spent two years and a half with them.\n\n'I didn't enjoy [the lifestyle] because I like to control myself, but it's really important for some young players.\n\n'Juventus have this DNA of working hard. I even saw some players vomit and they still finished the training sessions.\n\nBut he believed his time at the Italian giants was much tougher than his time at United\n\n'I remember every game they wanted me to run 12km. Sometimes I felt it made no sense because we always had the ball.\n\n'Some games I was running 9km, some 10km, and two days later at training, you have to complete your 12km so they made me run another 2km, 3km.\n\n'The training is harder than the game. Some people say it's easier to play in Italy but they wouldn't even be able to train. It was such a shock for me.'", "description": "The former left-back spent eight years at Old Trafford, making nearly 400 appearances for the English side, before moving onto Juventus towards the end of his playing career.", "authors": ["Amitai Winehouse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20027874-0-image-a-63_1571735821325.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
