Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who chairs the Senate Commerce subcommittee in charge of aviation. \u201cYou\u2019re the CEO. The buck stops with you.\"\n\nNo commitment to aircraft certification changes\n\nCurrently, most aircraft certification tasks are \u201cdelegated\u201d to the manufacturer itself, with FAA serving in an oversight role. But multiple probes into the twin 737 MAX crashes and the way the plane was certified have pointed to weaknesses in how the FAA oversees this program, which Congress has expanded at the request of manufacturers like Boeing.\n\nSenators repeatedly tried to get Muilenburg to outline what, if any, changes to the delegation system Boeing could support, largely to no avail.\n\nMuilenburg said he didn\u2019t have \u201cspecific recommendations\u201d for any changes the FAA should make, and defended the delegation program as having in fact \u201cenhanced safety.\u201d He noted the industry\u2019s stellar safety record over the past decade and said \u201ca portion of that can be attributed to the [delegation] process.\" But, he added, \"That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t refine and reform it over time.\u201d\n\nHowever, he declined to outline specifically what refinements may be necessary.\n\nMorning Transportation A daily speed read on transportation and infrastructure \u2014 in your inbox.

Media reports suggested that as the administration grappled with the decision, Muilenburg had made a personal appeal to President Donald Trump to keep them flying.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) asked Muilenburg bluntly if reports of Boeing lobbying the U.S. government to continue to allow the MAX to fly were true.\n\nMuilenburg avoided answering directly, saying Boeing reached out to authorities to \u201cunderstand what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe, with the FAA, were pursuing data to make a good safety-based decision. ... When data became available ... again with the FAA, we came to a conclusion that there could be similarities between the two accidents and that led very quickly to a decision to ground the fleet,\u201d Muilenburg said.\n\nThat\u2019s similar to the answer the FAA has given \u2014 that they made the decision to ground the fleet when there was data suggesting a potential link between the two crashes, one involving an Indonesian Lion Air plane and one involving an Ethiopian Airlines plane.\n\nPilot error he said/she said\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said that after the crashes, Boeing told his office that the accidents \u201cwere the result of pilot error.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose pilots never had a chance,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cThese loved ones never had a chance. They were in flying coffins as a result of Boeing deciding that it was going to conceal MCAS from the pilots.\u201d\n\nSen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) also said Boeing \u201cblamed the deceased pilots and the culture of the countries where the crashes occurred.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have not blamed the pilots,\u201d Muilenburg said. \u201cThat is not our company position, and it never will be. We are responsible for our airplanes. We are responsible, and we own that, regardless of cause.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0a/ff/a3b92550445185d69d5bf38b613a/191029-boeing-ceo-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
