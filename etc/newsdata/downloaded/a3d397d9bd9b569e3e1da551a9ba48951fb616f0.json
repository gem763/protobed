After Ireland\u2019s Taioseach Leo Varadkar briefed the press on his lengthy one-on-one talks with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, currency traders turned what had already been a good day for the pound into one in which sterling at one point made its greatest gain in more than two years.\n\nFor some context, this is what has happened to the pound against the dollar since the beginning of September, when Johnson\u2019s gambit to prorogue Parliament appeared briefly to have made a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit a virtual certainty:\n\nUnlike any of the big lurches in sterling that preceded it, the news that caused this dramatic leap had nothing to do with goings-on in Westminster. It all boils down to some remarkably positive words from Varadkar. He can now \u201csee a pathway to a possible deal\u201d \u2013 and he thinks it possible to reach that deal in the week before the European Union\u2019s summit on Brexit.\n\nBoth sides agreed not to release any details. But in comparison with the negativity that preceded it, the latest development justifies the optimism. Leo Varadkar is now the single most important player in the Brexit drama.\n\nThe entire issue of Brexit at this point boils down to the problem of the Northern Irish border. It is impossible for the whole of the U.K. to leave the EU\u2019s customs area without turning this border back into a customs border. That, in turn, would require physical infrastructure, something Ireland has refused to countenance. This is reasonable given the commitments made by the U.K. under the Good Friday Agreement, which resolved Northern Ireland\u2019s long-lasting \u201cTroubles.\u201d\n\nThis effectively makes Varadkar the EU's chief arbiter of whether any deal is acceptable. That\u2019s because the other EU countries would feel obliged to support a continuing member, rather than give way to a member that is leaving. To do otherwise would send a dreadful message to other smaller countries that might consider leaving.Varadkar has been studiously cautious. He said almost nothing positive about the proposal to resolve the issue that Johnson published last week. As even the Northern Irish business community said the plan was worse than the \u201cbackstop\u201d proposal put forth by Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May, which Parliament voted down, this wasn\u2019t surprising. And earlier this week, after Johnson spoke with Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, the briefing from Downing Street could scarcely have been more negative.\n\nIn this context, with an obstacle that seems almost impossible to surmount, and with no obvious previous attempt by Johnson even to try to surmount it, such positivity from Varadkar is extraordinary. It really does suggest that there is a game-changer. The fact that neither side has leaked the new proposal is also healthy, as it suggests that they have something worth discussing.\n\nSterling\u2019s move therefore makes sense. There is plenty more downside if the U.K. crashes out of the EU without a deal; but the chance that it could reach an agreement by the end of this month, the best available outcome at this point, had seemed impossible. With deep negativity toward the pound, it was therefore primed for a big move in response to any genuinely positive news.\n\nThe crucial question if the pound is to retain its gains: What on earth is Johnson proposing? Let us assume that he is dealing in good faith. If so, at this point, it is hard to see what could spark such positivity from Varadkar other than a customs border through the Irish Sea. This would settle all of Dublin\u2019s concerns; it would be simple and relatively easy to enforce. But it would also entail a further split of Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. Many in the mainland would have little problem with this, but the idea is anathema to the unionist community in Northern Ireland itself, and to many enthusiastic Brexiteers on the mainland.\n\nUntil now, the Democratic Unionist Party \u2013 the main unionist party in Northern Ireland \u2013 and Conservative Brexiteers have exercised a veto over all attempts to break the deadlock this way. If Varadkar reaches a deal with which he is satisfied, would these parties then move to block it?", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If the market is right, the chance of a resolution to the Brexit nightmare has just been transformed.
