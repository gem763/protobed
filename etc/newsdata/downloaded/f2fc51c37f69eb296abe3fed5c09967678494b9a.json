Suddenly, anything with a dedicated fandom and a familiar title is uniquely valuable, and the refrain \u201cSix seasons and a movie!,\u201d once used to rally Community fans into stumping for more of their favorite show, seems to apply to more and more properties. Veronica Mars got its own (partly fan-funded) movie, HBO finally made the Deadwood wrap-up movie, and this month, Netflix is continuing the Breaking Bad story where the AMC TV series left off, with Aaron Paul returning as meth dealer Jesse Pinkman in the original movie El Camino.\n\nFor Breaking Bad fans, at least, that\u2019s likely to be the highlight of Netflix\u2019s October offerings. For non-fans (from the \u201cI have to have someone to sympathize with in a show, and all these people are terrible\u201d brigade to the \u201cI hear it\u2019s great, I just haven\u2019t gotten around to it\u201d crowd), there are plenty of other options this month. Superhero fans will be interested in Raising Dion, a science fiction series about a single mom whose young son is developing mysterious powers. Apocalyptic-comedy fans have Daybreak, an upbeat teen series about navigating the end of the world. The raunchy animated series Big Mouth returns with another season about sex and puberty, this time with Westworld\u2019s Thandie Newton. Cardi B, Chance the Rapper, and Tip T.I. Harris launch the reality competition Rhythm + Flow. And Paul Rudd confronts a better version of himself in the science fiction comedy drama Living With Yourself.\n\nOn the film side, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s new movie The Laundromat follows his previous Netflix movie, High Flying Bird, in circling around imbalanced and unfair financial systems, this time looking at a form of insurance fraud that benefits the wealthy and bankrupts policyholders who thought they were covered. In the Tall Grass adapts a novella written by Stephen King and his son, horror writer Joe Hill, about a seemingly ordinary field where terrible things happen to seemingly ordinary people. Dolemite is My Name stars Eddie Murphy in a lively biopic about self-made groundbreaking comedian and movie star Rudy Ray Moore.\n\nAnd finally, as more American media companies prep their own streaming services, and competition for licensed content revs up, Netflix is investing heavily in licensing or developing content around the world. This month\u2019s streaming offerings are an embarrassment of riches for fans of international culture. The spread includes the Chinese science fiction series Nowhere Man, season 2 of the Italian teen drama Baby, the French rom-com series The Hook Up Plan, the Brazilian crime drama Brotherhood, the Indian work comedy Upstarts, and more. It\u2019s never been easier to see what entertainment looks like around the world.\n\nComing to Netflix\n\nOctober TBA\n\nMy Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan (talk show)\n\nNetflix description: The late-night king interviews the king of Bollywood, celebrated Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nOctober 1st\n\nCarmen Sandiego: season 2 (series)\n\nNetflix description: The stakes are higher than ever for Carmen, Ivy and Zack as V.I.L.E. unleashes a host of dastardly new villains while A.C.M.E. closes in.\n\nNikki Glaser: Bangin\u2019 (comedy special)\n\nNetflix description: Following her popular set on Season 1 of Netflix\u2019s The Standups, Nikki Glaser is back with her first hour long Netflix original comedy special, Bangin\u2019.
