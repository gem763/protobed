Forbes later confirmed this with its own sources, and added that the hack had also affected devices running Google's Android operating system and Microsoft's Windows.\n\nThe Uighurs are a mostly Muslim and heavily-surveilled minority living in China's Xinjiang region. Chinese authorities have detained somewhere between 1 and 2 million Uighur people in prison camps, describing it as a counter-terrorism measure.\n\nOne source told TechCrunch that some non-Uighur people were inadvertently infected because the websites could be found in Google search, and the FBI asked Google to de-index the websites. The FBI declined to comment when contacted by TechCrunch.\n\nApple, Google, and Microsoft did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson said: \"Google Project Zero was very specific in its blog post that the recently publicized attacks used unique iPhone exploits and they have not disclosed similar information to us. Microsoft has a strong commitment to investigate reported security issues and, should new information be disclosed, we will take appropriate action as needed to help keep customers protected.\"", "description": "Google's initial report said the hack was an indiscriminate attack that used a handful of malicious websites to infect people's phones.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c1a477e2ab31e06422c61d6-1136-568.jpg"}
