The streaming giant added 6.8 million subscribers overall during the third quarter of 2019, a three-month period marked by new seasons of established hits such as Stranger Things and Orange is the New Black. While the 6.8 million gain was a bit below the 7 million additions Netflix had projected, it still represented a spike of 12% over the same July-September period last year and the company\u2019s best-ever third quarter in terms of new sign-ups. Almost all of the company\u2019s growth last quarter came from international markets, with only about 500,000 new U.S. subscribers coming on board. And with rival streaming platforms from Disney and Apple about to launch, Netflix is now telling investors to expect some turbulence in the short-term.\n\nThe good news for Netflix from Wednesday\u2019s numbers is that the company didn\u2019t have a rerun of its not-very-good second quarter performance. After years of non-stop growth, Netflix reported in June that its subscriber base had decreased in the United States last spring, marking the first such decline for the company since the Qwikster debacle of 2011. Instead of an expected gain of 300,000 during the second quarter of 2019 (April through June), Netflix actually lost about 130,000 homes in the U.S. Wall Street\u2019s reaction to the news was severe: The company\u2019s share price, which was a bit above $360 right before the spring earnings report, tumbled to as low as $255 at the end of September, though it rebounded a bit since, closing at around $286 today, before the latest earnings figures were announced.\n\nBy contrast, while Netflix still didn\u2019t quite live up to its own forecasts, it resumed growing in the U.S. during the third quarter and, more importantly, did a bit better than forecast internationally. In after-hours trading, Netflix stock was way up, jumping well over the $300 mark. This, even though the company said it expects its year-end 2019 subscriber numbers won\u2019t be as robust as it had been projecting. Netflix now says it will likely end 2019 with 26.7 million net additional new subscribers, about two million fewer than the 28.6 million it added in 2018. That\u2019s hardly a disaster: Netflix is still going to end 2019 with nearly three times the number of subscribers it had five years ago. But for a company used to not just growing but growing at a faster clip each year, this sort of slow down in not insignificant. Netflix told investors it believes \u201cthe minor elevated churn in response to some price changes\u201d\u2014 i.e., people canceling because of price hikes\u2014 \u201cand new forthcoming competition\u201d is what\u2019s slowing its rate of growth. It\u2019s also conceding the debuts of Apple TV+ and Disney+ next month, along with other services coming online in 2020, will have an impact on the company. \u201cThe launch of these new services will be noisy,\u201d Netflix told shareholders and investors. \u201cThere may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance.\u201d\n\nThat said, Netflix says it still believes its long-term outlook is fine. In what it calls the overall competition for entertainment screen time, Netflix believes there\u2019s still \u201ca very large market opportunity.\u201d The company says it believes Netflix use in the U.S. is less than 10% of all TV screen time here, allowing for plenty of room to grow. \u201cMany are focused on the \u2018streaming wars,\u2019 but we\u2019ve been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade,\u201d Netflix wrote in its investor letter. \u201cThe upcoming arrival of services like Disney+, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Peacock is increased competition, but we are all small compared to linear TV. While the new competitors have some great titles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world\u2026.We expect we\u2019ll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity.\u201d\n\nAs has become common for Netflix investor letters, the company included some non-verified viewing stats to demonstrate the popularity of its content. It said Stranger Things has had its most-watched season yet, with 64 million member homes watching at least one episode of season three. Similarly, it said 32 million homes had sampled critically-hailed drama Unbelievable within a month of its release. And on the film side, a movie many on social media dunked on \u2014 Tall Girl\u2014 was seen in 41 million homes within a month of debuting. None of these numbers have been verified by third parties, but at least in the case of Stranger Things 3, there\u2019s evidence to suggest Netflix isn\u2019t just making this data up. Ratings giant Nielsen, which measures U.S. viewing of Netflix shows on TV screens (but not mobile) said in July that nearly 20 million viewers here had seen the first episode of the show\u2019s new season during its first weekend of release.", "description": "Netflix keeps getting bigger, but it\u2019s not growing quite as fast as it had been\u2014particularly in the United States.
