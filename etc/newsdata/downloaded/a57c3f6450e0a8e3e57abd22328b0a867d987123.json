Business development must be somewhat trying when your website is password-protected. Safe to say Shandy hasn\u2019t taken too many client accounts from McKinsey or Bain. At least he\u2019s still got his pony ranch. Does Morgans analyst Scott \u201cScooter\u201d Murdoch come in on Saturdays to sweep out the stalls?\n\nMore recently, Blue Sky\u2019s redundant chief investment officer (and a member of the board) Alex McNab has set up VSB Advisory, which offers such services as \u201chelping you find targets to acquire\u201d (so flicking through Dr Elaine Stead\u2019s favourite shoe shops), \u201csourcing equity capital\u201d (read: calling Morgans), \u201cidentifying short term cash levers\u201d (read: calling Oaktree) and \u201cexecution support\u201d (for companies in need of a cyanide cap or the electric chair).\n\nAnother Blue Sky board alumnus (and its head of growth capital) Nick Dignam has established Fortitude Investment Partners with his former team members at the Enron of Eagle Street, Nick Miller, Bryan Brown and Sam O\u2019Connor. And fortitude is what you\u2019d need in spades to entrust them with a dime of your hard earned.\n\nThen there\u2019s Blue Sky\u2019s head of real estate, Edan Norris, now flogging a five lot residential subdivision in beautiful Yamanto, on the St Marys side of Ipswich. Pitiable. To his credit, Edan\u2019s appetite for cheapjack property flips is not the exclusive preserve of his sorry career.", "description": "Blue Sky's valedictorians have moved onto VSB Advisory, Fortitude Investment Partners and even a subdivision in the back blocks of Yamanto.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_94/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7dcbc87ccffdb7af37f4dae759eee07469fcc937", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
