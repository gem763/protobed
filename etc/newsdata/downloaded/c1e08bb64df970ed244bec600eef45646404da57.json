Women were also more likely to tip than men, 57% vs. 48%. Even though men and millennials do tip, their tipping habits are inconsistent.\n\nMillennials are most likely to tip servers in a sit-down restaurant, followed by food delivery people. Unfortunately for hotel housekeepers, only 15% of millennials will always tip them, compared to a quarter of baby boomers, who are actually less likely to tip coffee shop baristas.\n\nREUTERS/Tami Chappell More\n\nThough men and millennials are the most reluctant tippers, they can be the most generous. More men than women will tip over 20% while nearly a quarter of millennials are willing to tip more than 20% on the bill. That\u2019s compared to only 5% of baby boomers.\n\nMore people rely on tips\n\nTipping is a contentious issue in the United States; the internet is rife with articles around the etiquette of tipping, and how much one should tip. While most people expect to tip waitstaff in restaurants, fewer people tip as a token of appreciation during the holiday season.\n\nTeachers and childcare providers fare the best \u2014 just over half receive tips at the holidays, or on occasion. But 70% of all the CreditCards.com survey respondents say they never tip their trash collectors, and 60% of respondents say they don\u2019t give gratuities to their mail carriers.\n\nAs the gig economy grows, so does the number of people who rely on tips. The federal minimum wage for tipped workers is only $2.13 an hour, so tips are a critical way that workers earn a living. The Raise the Wage Act, a Democrat-led bill working its way through the House aims to abolish the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers. Several Democratic presidential candidates support the initiative, including Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIt makes sense then that \u201cempathy\u201d can factor into tipping habits. According to the survey, just under 30% of Americans have held a job at one point or another where they received tips. \u201cConsequently,\u201d the report says, \u201cthey\u2019re better tippers \u2014 leaving on average 22% at restaurants versus 17% among people who never received tips. Also, they\u2019re significantly more likely to tip housekeepers, baristas, mail carriers, trash collectors, teachers and childcare providers.\u201d\n\nKristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
