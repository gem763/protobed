Now in this exclusive live & sharp video recording from resident in Yuen Long, you could notice how police assaulted and kicked the man from \"Protect the Child\" action #antiELAB #ExtraditionLaw #HongKongProtests pic.twitter.com/nbgkLkraOD\n\nAccording to the group, the man in the video had confronted officers during a protest on Saturday in Yuen Long, in Hong Kong\u2019s New Territories. He had shouted at police after they pepper-sprayed one of the group\u2019s members, a 73-year-old known as Uncle Chan. Chan had been trying to stop officers from dragging a protester into an alley.\n\n\u201cHe started shouting at the police officers but actually he didn\u2019t touch any of them,\u201d said Kenneth Ip, a member of the group. \u201cHe kept shouting at them and after that the police officer pulled him inside the police line.\u201d\n\nIp said it was difficult to see what was happening but the man appeared to have lost consciousness after police dragged him away. He was later taken to hospital and charged with assaulting a police officer. He does not want to be publicly identified, according to the group.\n\nThe videos have prompted outrage. The police suggested they were doctored and said officers were kicking a \u201cyellow object\u201d as opposed to a person, with Twitter users saying the video appeared to clearly show a human being lying on the ground.\n\nVasco Williams, the superintendent of New Territories North, said it was difficult to tell what was happening in the video as it was \u201cout of focus\u201d and other footage contradicted it.\n\n\u201cThere are videos that show the entire incident where [nothing] happened,\u201d Williams told reporters on Monday. \u201cThe genuine online feed showed that there was no assault \u2026 Do you think police officers would be that stupid to assault someone under detention?\u201d\n\nWilliams said two people had been pulled into the alley by officers in clashes on Saturday, prompting protesters to charge the police. He said one man had been arrested after he pushed a police officer and bit his hand during his arrest.\n\nClashes between police and protests during the demonstrations, which have lasted more than three months, have grown increasingly violent. More than 1,500 people have been arrested.\n\nIn a separate incident on Tuesday, the Democratic party legislator Roy Kwong was taken to hospital after he was attacked by a group of men, according to a Facebook post by a fellow legislator.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Kwong said he was getting into his car in the morning when he was dragged out by three men who began punching and kicking him for about a minute, while a fourth person filmed the incident.\n\n\u201cAs a lawmaker \u2026 protecting Hong Kongers is our rightful mission. If protecting Hong Kong people means we come under attack, this is an international scandal,\u201d Kwong said. \u201cMy wounds hurt a bit, it hurts even to speak \u2026 but this pain is nothing compared to the harm that has been inflicted on the people of Hong Kong.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Protect the children\u2019 group contradicts police claims officers were only kicking a \u2018yellow object\u2019", "authors": ["Erin Hale"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21776a13c2ace6434a659fb2e5413cc4008020ad/0_229_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0b76f01491b2a2818175923c40b5d7fb", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
