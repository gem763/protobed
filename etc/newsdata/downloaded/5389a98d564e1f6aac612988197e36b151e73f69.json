The international benchmark blend was up 1.2% at $58.95 a barrel.\n\nBloomberg reported that China had expressed its continued willingness to strike a limited deal, while the Financial Times reported that China was willing to buy up to 10 million tons more in U.S. soybeans a year. That would be worth around $3.25 billion at current prices.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said at the weekend he\u2019s not interested in a partial deal and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last month that the dispute couldn\u2019t be solved just by China buying \u201ca little more pork or soybeans.\u201d\n\nThe news nonetheless supported a market that has been beaten down in recent days by fears over global demand. Russell Hardy, chief executive of Vitol, one of the world\u2019s largest oil traders, was quoted by wires on Wednesday as telling a conference that global demand could grow by as little as 750,000 barrels a day this year, well below the forecast of OPEC and the International Energy Agency.\n\n\"Concerns over the future are winning,\u201d Energy Intelligence reported Hardy as saying. \u201cThe risk premium vanished pretty quickly after the Saudi attacks.\u201d\n\nHe and other senior executives from the trading industry all said they say averaging less than $60 a barrel next year, a figure that may squeeze the cash flow of international majors who budget for around that figure.\n\nDemand fears were clearly in focus after Tuesday\u2019s data from the showing an estimated 4.1 million rise in inventories last week, well ahead of the expected 1.41 million barrel increase. Official government will be released at 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT).\n\nElsewhere, were up 1.2% at $1.6004 a gallon, while futures were down 0.6% at $2.2760 per 10,000 MMBtu.\n\nElsewhere, were up 1.2% at $1.6004 a gallon, while futures were down 0.6% at $2.2760 per 10,000 MMBtu.", "description": "Oil Prices Rise on Renewed Trade Hopes Ahead of Talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC1S0Y5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
