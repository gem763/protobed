They posed for a photo, but declined to answer questions about their task at hand.\n\nIn reality, Pence and Pompeo\u2019s mission is fraught with risk: The president sent his top deputy and his top diplomat to try to change the behavior of a foreign leader who has said in no uncertain terms that he has no intention of complying.\n\nIt was only the most recent setback for the United States as it tries to halt an invasion that has killed civilians, driven America\u2019s former Kurdish allies into the arms of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad and caused the release of hundreds of ISIS prisoners.\n\nOnboard Pompeo's plane \u2014 a modified Boeing 757 \u2014 there was a bit of turbulence, but no noticeable sign of the political storms raging on both sides of the Atlantic. TVs were tuned to Fox News upon takeoff. Dinner was chicken, potatoes and cheese, salad and a big slice of chocolate cake.\n\nPompeo\u2019s trip will also take him to Jerusalem for consultations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and to Brussels for a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nIt comes as the secretary grows more deeply enmeshed in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe, with State Department staffers defying his orders to share their accounts of how the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, led a shadow foreign policy with Ukraine that cut out professional diplomats.\n\nJust before departing Washington, a jacketless Pompeo dropped by the press cabin to say hello. He noted that the vice president is leading this delegation to Turkey, and said it was \u201cour mission set to see if we can get a cease-fire\u201d in Syria.\n\nBack in Washington, a bipartisan duo of senators, Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), are set to unveil a sanctions package punishing Turkey for its incursion, building on the more limited measures the administration announced earlier this week.\n\nAnd the president\u2019s top two military advisers, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, are holding a classified briefing on Capitol Hill to update lawmakers on developments in Syria.", "description": "Trump dispatches his top deputy and his top diplomat to convince Erdo\u011fan to reverse his assault on northeastern Syria.", "authors": ["Jake Sherman", "Zia Weise", "Evan Semones"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176345849-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
