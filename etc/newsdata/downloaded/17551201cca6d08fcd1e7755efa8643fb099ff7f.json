(AP) \u2014 In front of New Hope Baptist Church in Virginia Beach, supporters of President Donald Trump hollered for his reelection. Behind it, taped-up signs on the doors warned, \u201cFirearms Not Allowed.\u201d And inside, Rep. Elaine Luria personally delivered her call for Trump\u2019s impeachment, drawing a standing ovation from more than half of the 200 or so people attending her town hall \u2014 and a few jeers, shut down quickly by church security officials.\n\n\u201cI got no problem throwing you out,\u201d the Rev. James Allen, the moderator, told one heckler. \u201cIf you can\u2019t sit here and be respectful, get out.\u201d\n\nThe man, a Trump supporter, agreed to quiet down and stay. But the signs were there that Luria\u2019s call last month for Trump\u2019s impeachment sits uneasily among some of her constituents in one of the most deeply split congressional districts in the country. It\u2019s not clear, though, that the calls for formal charges against Trump have generated a voter backlash, even in districts like Luria\u2019s.\n\nThe majority voted for Trump in 2016, but Luria, a Democrat, won it two years later, helping hand her party control of the House. Here, national security is understood perhaps better than elsewhere: 1 in 5 people are active military personnel, veterans or their families. So House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and national Democrats are closely watching districts like it for clues to whether their drive to impeach Trump supports or imperils the party\u2019s congressional and presidential ambitions in 2020.\n\nWin or lose next year, Luria and six other freshmen who flipped Republican districts will have played a critical role, with considerable risk. They resisted calls for the president\u2019s impeachment over Russia\u2019s election interference. But details of Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Biden family was, Luria and the others wrote in The Washington Post, a clear abuse of power and an impeachable offense. Their column, in part, freed up Pelosi to launch formal impeachment proceedings, specifically under the terms Luria and other freshmen had requested: clearly articulated, focused on Ukraine and brought to a quick conclusion.\n\nLuria and the other national security freshmen have quietly become a force within Democratic politics, at a time when the party is struggling to nominate a presidential candidate and project a unified message.\n\nBut there\u2019s been nothing quiet about their first visits home this after their calls for impeachment. In Michigan, another frontline Democratic freshman and co-author of the op-ed, Michigan\u2019s Elissa Slotkin, faced boos \u2014 and then applause \u2014 when she started explaining why she, too, had called for an impeachment investigation. In Staten Island, N.Y., freshman Rep. Max Rose \u2014 like Luria \u2014 got a standing ovation from many in his audience when he announced he was supporting the impeachment inquiry, according to multiple news reports.\n\nBack in Virginia, walking around the block of her leafy Norfolk-area neighborhood, Luria acknowledged the impeachment decision may cost her.\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where I have to do the right thing,\u201d said Luria, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and black belt in taekwondo. Her home, a short walk from spectacular views of the Virginia Port Authority and not far from Norfolk Naval Station, is adorned with ceramics and other souvenirs that she and her husband, Robert Blondin, picked up on their global travels.\n\nLuria says if she loses her seat over the impeachment call, \u201cI will have been on the right side of history.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment Luria repeated that night at the town hall at the E. Ray Cox Sr. Convocation Center. Eight miles away, 12 people were killed during the May 31 mass shooting at Virginia Beach Municipal Center \u2014 including Ryan Keith Cox, the pastor\u2019s son. Luria opened the event by noting that the last time she spoke there, it was for the younger Cox\u2019s funeral. His coffin rested where she now stood to answer questions.\n\nBut the moment did little to ease the crackling political atmosphere in the room. A few hours earlier, Trump had exhorted China to help investigate the Bidens, defiant in the face of calls for impeachment over the same approach to Ukraine. At the town hall, Trump supporters who were coordinated for the event waved signs reading, \u201cImpeach Elaine\u201d and \u201cPelosi Puppet.\u201d\n\nLuria, like Pelosi and other Democrats, argued she\u2019s doing her day job even amid the impeachment drive. Pelosi has referred to that technique as operating on two tracks \u2014 legislative and oversight \u2014 while Trump has insisted that when there\u2019s investigation, there can be no legislation.\n\nThe retired naval nuclear engineer, 44, pointed out four people in the front row helped by her office on immigration, health care and veterans issues. And she mentioned work she\u2019s doing leading House subcommittees on seapower and disability assistance as a member of both the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs committees. She also said she\u2019s working on \u201ccommonsense universal background checks\u201d for gun purchases.\n\nThen Luria took questions, drawn from a plastic box and read by Allen. A bit more than half were supportive of her call for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u201cBravo,\u201d said one questioner, noting Luria\u2019s \u201cbrave patriotic decision on the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nNavy veteran Joe Deleon, 70, of Virginia Beach, shouted something, prompting the rebuke from Allen.\n\n\u201cI like her, she\u2019s a good congressman,\u201d Deleon, wearing a \u201cVietnam\u201d Navy cap, said afterward. He said he sees nothing wrong with Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine for election help against a political rival. But he sees trouble in Luria\u2019s decision. \u201cIf she continues this farce, she is going to get voted out. This district voted for Trump, and they\u2019re going to vote for him again.\u201d\n\nLuria won the race over Republican retired Navy SEAL Scott Taylor by a little over 2 percentage points, while Trump won the district by more than 3 percentage points. That makes the district, which straddles the place where the Chesapeake Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean, a key bellwether in a state where people don\u2019t register by party.\n\nBoth political camps are weighing into the 2020 race. The House Republicans\u2019 super PAC and Luria\u2019s 2018 opponent, Taylor, are trying to link Luria with liberals. The Congressional Leadership Fund on Sept. 30 launched a digital ad that featured a photo of Luria surrounded by photos of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, along with footage of Rep. Rashida Tlaib\u2019s now famous vow to \u201cimpeach the mother\u2014-r.\u201d\n\nAnd the Democrats\u2019 campaign arm has pledged to jump into races waged by front liners who have come out for impeachment, including Luria. They\u2019re sharing internal polling and help with messaging, including on how to characterize the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\n\u201cI think that district has a great test for whether Luria and Democrats can bring along kind of maybe disaffected Republicans and moderates to not only vote against the president but also to support an impeachment inquiry,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, an elections analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily know if there\u2019s majority support in that district for that \u2026 it remains to be seen how persuadable a lot of those voters may be.\u201d\n\nAt the town hall, a man who gave his name as Chris Columbus is exactly the type of constituent Luria hopes to influence. He said he\u2019s an independent, troubled by the way the media reports on Trump and how public sentiment has shifted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of on the fence about certain things, and one of them is directly related to the impeachment,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she jumped on the bandwagon too quick.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Rhonda Shafner and senior producer Tracy Brown contributed to this report.", "description": "VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.
