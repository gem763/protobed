At news conferences and in television appearances, they cast President Trump as an untrustworthy deal-breaker, and European leaders largely sided with the pair in a desperate effort to preserve the 2015 nuclear agreement after the United States renounced it.\n\nThis year could not be more different.\n\nSuddenly, President Hassan Rouhani and his witty, often biting American-educated foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, are on the defensive. They are denying any Iranian involvement in the destruction of two major Saudi oil facilities, an assertion that even former Secretary of State John Kerry, who negotiated the nuclear accord four years ago and has become its biggest defender, finds far-fetched. Iran, he said, was behind the attack \u201cone way or the other.\u201d\n\nIran is now admitting how much damage the American-led sanctions have done to its economy \u2014 crashing the currency and turning a boomlet into a recession.\n\nMr. Zarif, while reserving most of his anger for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who he has called a \u201cwarmonger,\u201d has now turned on the Europeans. After committing to preserving the nuclear deal by compensating for much of the revenue Iran was losing, the Europeans \u201chave failed in every single one\u201d of their specific commitments, he said in a meeting with reporters on Sunday.", "description": "The country\u2019s foreign minister, on the defensive after attacks on Saudi oil facilities, says Iran has lost hope that the Europeans will counterbalance American sanctions.", "authors": ["David E.
