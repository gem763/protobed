(That his jokes traded in boring, retrograde stereotypes of Asian-Americans was all the more cringe-inducing given that SNL had just made history hiring its first-ever Asian cast member alongside Gillis, Bowen Yang.)\n\nGillis\u2019s jokes were outwardly racist. They weren\u2019t jokes about racism, or satire about race, or illuminating truths about the marginalized. They were racist jokes, and quite bland ones at that. People were pissed. Then people became pissed that people were pissed. Censorship! McCarthyism! Worst of all: Cancel culture!\n\n\u201cCancel culture\u201d is a phrase that\u2019s been lobbed often this past year, as an impulse toward outrage is ever-amplified by the megaphone of social media. But what the hell does it even mean?\n\nAt face value, the term refers to what is perceived as a reflexive, unfair ruthlessness. In a society that is increasingly concerned with being politically correct and \u201cwoke,\u201d there is no tolerance of anyone whose words, attitudes, or behavior do not adhere to those mores. And as those ideas are most often ascribed to people who hold liberal values, it is often alleged that this applies to anyone who speaks or does anything that works against a utopian lefitst ideal. In other words, say something that upsets a \u201csnowflake\u201d and you\u2019re fired.\n\nIn that version of \u201ccancel culture,\u201d we\u2019re a lynch mob of Red Queens, hysterically policing social media for problematic people, screaming \u201coff with their heads!\u201d anytime we encounter an idea we don\u2019t like.\n\nBut like many phrases and ideas in 2019, this one has been appropriated, bastardized, and misused to the point of not only betraying its original definition and its usefulness in checking the actual repercussions of reactionary censorship, but in fact has become almost meaningless.\n\nNow, \u201ccancel culture\u201d isn\u2019t a diagnosis of a concerning trend that has become prevalent in recent years: Celebrity says something eyebrow-raising, ensure that the celebrity never works again! No, it\u2019s morphed into an excuse used by those who wish to justify or endorse the very words and behaviors that are being flagged as offensive in the first place.\n\nYou see, consequences are not \u201ccancel culture.\u201d Just as entitlement is not a rationalization for offensive behavior.\n\nIt would take too long to list all the recent controversies involving celebrities who said something alarming enough to detonate social media outrage: Scarlett Johansson defends Woody Allen, Dave Chappelle mocks Michael Jackson\u2019s accusers, Lara Spencer shames male dancers, a Queer Eye host rails against his critics, some Real Housewives are caught being casually transphobic.\n\nSome of these celebrities apologized. Some didn\u2019t. All were likely forced to consider the impact and the responsibility of their words, amid outcry and, in many cases, calls for them to lose their jobs. But none of them were fired. Shane Gillis, however, was. Is that a symptom of cancel culture?\n\nGillis is a prime example of what is really happening, and how that reality is being skewered. No one, at least not the rational among the cultural critics, is denying Gillis\u2019s right to make his jokes, no matter if they are racist and no matter if they are, above all of that, woefully lame. But just because Gillis has a right to make those jokes doesn\u2019t mean he has a right to a bigger platform from which to make them.\n\nA job on Saturday Night Live is not owed to anybody. It is arguably one of the highest-profile gigs in comedy. Fans, audiences, and critics are right to expect some sort of responsibility or awareness, a certain standard, from those who are given that platform. They are right to be upset if it comes out that one of those benefactors has a history of espousing racist views. Gillis, in turn, had a right to respond to those who were angered. His response didn\u2019t satisfy those critics, nor did it satisfy his employer. So he was fired. That is how jobs work.\n\nSNL is a major platform. Johansson, the highest-paid woman in Hollywood, has huge outreach when she speaks for a magazine cover story. People expect a certain sensitivity from a woman who hosts Good Morning America. Dave Chapelle is being paid $60 million for his Netflix comedy specials. Of course the content of those specials is going to be subject to scrutiny. What the hell else is he being paid for?\n\nUse comedy to ask difficult questions, to provoke. But also listen when these things cause a reaction.\n\nResulting consequences and consideration are not \u201ccanceling\u201d someone. We have indeed entered an era of lunacy in which there are people who demand nonsensical repercussions for the whiff of a lack of political correctness. But crying \u201ccancel culture\u201d any time a person is asked to atone for or justify something they said? That ain\u2019t it.\n\nBrad Is Sad About His Dad in Ad Astra, and I Am Glad\n\nIn Ad Astra, Brad Pitt gets in a gunfight with moon pirates. Later, he wrestles a feral space monkey with his bare hands. He also commandeers a rocket ship on its way to Neptune after sneaking on board during its launch.\n\nIt\u2019s always funny how easily someone can make any movie seem ridiculous when reducing it its oddest details and plot lines, and it doesn\u2019t get much odder than these isolated scenes in Ad Astra. The truth is that the film, out Friday, is shockingly quiet, as far as movies set in outer space starring Brad Pitt and featuring moon pirates go. In fact, crazy as those plot points sound, it couldn\u2019t be centered around a more commonly explored and recognizable topic. Ad Astra is about an astronaut with daddy issues.\n\nOn the one hand, there is nothing more laughably endemic of Hollywood\u2019s circle jerk of straight white guys than an indie film director getting $100 million to write a movie about a man working through existential issues with his father while in actual space. On the other hand, you know what? Brad Pitt is great in this movie. It\u2019s very pretty, too!\n\nThere was an outright hullabaloo after the release of Pitt\u2019s other film this summer, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. In it, the 55-year-old stud takes a break from his wry smiling and sardony to climb on a roof and take off his shirt, revealing the kind of abs that make the weakest among faint from thirst. Yes, he looked, as they say, EXTREMELY HOT!!!\n\nBut I came to a sobering realization while watching his quiet, contemplative performance in Ad Astra. The abs, the naked torso, that V thing at the waistline of his low-rise jeans: Even with all that, I\u2019m never more attracted to the man than when he is sad, silent, and moody\u2014as he is, almost relentlessly, in Ad Astra. What does it say about me that I prefer Sad Brad to Abs Brad? My therapist and I will have an answer for you shortly.\n\n\u201cSorry to This Man\u201d Is the Greatest Meme Ever\n\nI do not know what makes some memes funny, so funny that they can be employed ad nauseum and they make you laugh each and every time, while the appeal of most others burn fast and bright.\n\nThat said, Hustlers star Keke Palmer\u2019s \u201csorry to this man\u201d monologue is the funniest thing I have ever seen. I love it. I won\u2019t stop loving it. I will be sorry to this man until my dying day.\n\nRegret \u201cCutting the Cord\u201d Yet?\n\nNBC announced this week that its streaming service will launch in April 2020, feature reboots of Battlestar Galactica, Saved By the Bell, and Punky Brewster, and be called Peacock. That all sounds...fine, should you decide to add the streaming service to your roster. Speaking of, allow me to list the slate of current and upcoming streaming services to which you can subscribe:\n\nApple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Netflix, CBS All Access, Hulu, Starz, Showtime Now, HBO Go, ESPN+, The Criterion Channel, Quibi, Peacock, The Criterion Channel, YouTube TV, Shudder, BET+, Sling TV, Philo, fuboTV...\n\nAnyway, you asshats all complained about cable. Now look.\n\nLisa Simpson Got a Big Promotion\n\nFox announced this week that its new head of talent relations is Lisa Simpson. Not the cartoon character, an actual woman named Lisa Simpson. At Fox! This amuses me.\n\nWhat to watch this week:\n\nDownton Abbey: It\u2019s so nice!\n\nAd Astra: Not bad astra.\n\nWhere\u2019s My Roy Cohn?: The story of the man who made Trump a monster.\n\nEmergence: My favorite broadcast drama of the fall.\n\nWhat to skip this week:\n\nRambo: Last Blood: \u201cAn orgy of death.\u201d \u2014The New York Post", "description": "Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568979934/190919-obsessed-tease_nijopo", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
