(Photo: Zach Gibson / Getty)\n\nIn an explosive whistleblower complaint made public on Thursday, senior White House officials are accused of attempting to conceal records Donald Trump\u2019s conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart \u2014 the content of which has prompted impeachment proceedings in the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 by placing the records in a computer system reserved for some of the nation\u2019s mostly highly guarded secrets.\n\nThe complaint, released in redacted form by the Democratic-controlled U.S. House Intelligence Committee, cites allegations by multiple unnamed White House officials that a transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was placed into a standalone computer system under the National Security Council\u2019s management. The system, the complaint says, is used to house \u201ccodeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: Whistleblower complaint\n\nCode-word information refers to the nation\u2019s most highly classified intelligence. It is often described as \u201cbeyond top secret,\u201d being further protected by extreme need-to-know protocols that compartmentalise access to a select group of individuals.\n\nTo ensure their absolute loyalty, individuals with access to code-word information are typically required to have held high-level security clearances for several years and, further, undergo some of the intelligence community\u2019s most extreme vetting.\n\nIf the White House, as alleged, sought to limit access to the Zelensky-call transcript to officials with this level of clearance, it would indicate extraordinary concern over the contents ever going public. It may also be considered an abuse of the system for political means given the nature of the call itself, in which Trump apparently tried to solicit a favour from Zelensky \u2014 asking Ukraine to open an investigation into Trump\u2019s domestic political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nScreenshot: Whistleblower complaint\n\n\u201cAccording to information I received from White House officials, some officials voiced concerns internally that this would be an abuse of the system and was not consistent with the responsibility of the [NSC] Directorate for Intelligence Programs,\u201d the whistleblower, an anonymous career intelligence official, wrote in their complaint.\n\nThe complaint goes on to say that White House officials indicated this was not \u201cthe first time\u201d during the Trump administration that a presidential transcript had been into the code-word system \u201csolely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2014 rather than national security sensitive \u2014 information.\u201d\n\nThe acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, said that he had \u201cno firsthand knowledge\u201d of any potential misuse of the computer system when pressed on Thursday by a member of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee. \u201cAll I have is the knowledge that the whistleblower alleges in his allegation, the whistleblower complaint,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether, in fact, that is true or not.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower also states that they believe Trump\u2019s actions \u2014 pressuring a foreign power to investigate his political rival \u2014 pose risks to national security and undermine the U.S. government\u2019s efforts \u201cto deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections.\u201d", "description": "In an explosive whistleblower complaint made public on Thursday, senior White House officials are accused of attempting to conceal records Donald Trump\u2019s conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart \u2014 the content of which has prompted impeachment proceedings in the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 by placing the...", "authors": ["Beth Elderkin", "Brian Kahn"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/be3fh2qxcjcucetdvuga.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
