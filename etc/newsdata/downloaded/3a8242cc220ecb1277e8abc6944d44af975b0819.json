Why would the EU trust Boris Johnson, Mr Straight Banana himself? They know him too well, I guess.\n\nThe EU is rightly worried about exactly how strictly the border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland would be policed. There are also concerns that our chlorinated chicken ends up in, say, Lancashire where it is made into other food products \u2013 pasties, chicken nuggets, twizzlers or whatever \u2013 and then exported to Ireland or the rest of the EU for that matter.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

The horror of a Parisian shopper at discovering their coq au vin ready meal was in fact poulet chlor\u00e9 would be an unacceptable affront to the French way of life.\n\nThen there are goods landing at Belfast docks \u2013 wholesome euro-friendly non-chlorinated chickens, say, from outside the EU or Great Britain, some of which will be destined for Northern Irish tummies, others for Great Britain and yet others for Ireland and, potentially, across the entire EU, either as they stand or in some processed chicken products.\n\nThere again the EU authorities are being asked to entrust HMRC, a foreign organisation with no vested interest, to collect the tariffs due to the EU, and reimburse as appropriate the importers on any overpayment of tariffs, depending on the ultimate destination of the chicken. Again, it is unusual for any nation or supra-national body to sub-contract tax collection. The danger, as the EU sees it, is of weakening the integrity and health of the single market, and opening up huge opportunities for smuggling and fraud.\n\nSecond, there is the unacknowledged truth \u2013 it is merely a matter of institutional self-interest and bias \u2013 that the EU cannot create such an attractive precedent for the UK that other EU member states might fancy a slice of that cake too.\n\nA world where an EU member state, with a UK-style deal, can be effectively part of the EU customs union yet able to strike trade deals across the world presents obvious risks for the future of the European project. What if Hungary or Italy sought to strike free trade deals with Russia and India, just as the British plan to? What if the Swedes and Dutch also quite fancied a free trade deal with China, complementing their EU arrangements. Plus, they get rid of their EU budget subscriptions and the ECJ!\n\nYes they too would lose the advantages of the single market, but they might consider that a price worth paying for greater economic freedom. There might not be much left of the EU\u2019s structural integrity after all that. The Euroscepctics have a point when they say it is not in the EU\u2019s interests to let the UK have such an advantageous deal that everyone is allowed to keep the EU\u2019s benefits and jettison its costs and obligations.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely rational and sensible for the EU to behave in that way \u2013 not \u201cselfish\u201d, or no more selfish than the British are being.\n\nLast, the EU is desperately concerned about having the British try to set up another economic model \u2013 Singapore-on-Thames as it\u2019s called \u2013 a race-to-the-bottom, freewheeling, free enterprise, low-tax, small-state economy that is designed to undercut and outcompete the Europeans.\n\nThey do not want chicken and ham pies made with slave labour in unsafe factories from American chlorinated chicken heading their way, or taking world markets from their producers. Whether that particular poultry-based nightmare is realistic or not, and no one can say what standards and regulations a future UK government would choose to raise or lower, again the EU is entitled to ask questions about what kind of a trading partner they are about to sign up with.\n\nIt is what Boris Johnson explicitly wants. It is in fact the whole point of Brexit \u2013 to improve productivity and competitiveness. It is not welcome on the other side of the Channel. In the words of Michel Barnier: \u201cHe has asked us to remove the reference to a level playing field \u2013 a very important point \u2013 which we agreed with Theresa May. These are the ground rules, a foundation of rules in the area of tax, state aid, social rights, environmental rights and consumer rights.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, we are faced with this request for a basic free trade deal, which runs the risk of regulatory competition, even fiscal, social or environmental dumping. We will not accept this.\u201d\n\nAll of which will basically leave the Johnson deal in roughly the same place as the Theresa May deal \u2013 a footnote of history. The choice will revert, as always, to the basic, binary one \u2013 no deal or no Brexit.\n\nThe \u201cblame\u201d will have been skilfully dodged by London and Dublin and left with Brussels. Which is fine, because Barnier and the EU can live with it as a price worth paying for preserving the EU. On the other hand, the UK and Ireland cannot live with a no deal Brexit, and that is why it will not happen.", "description": "As always, when thinking about Brexit, the best thing to do is to summon up the totemic bird of our times \u2013 the chlorinated chicken.
