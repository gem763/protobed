They also put the nation\u2019s leadership further at odds with climate-change advocates calling for the closure of the country\u2019s fleet of 21 coal-fired plants and with a business community increasingly funding renewables.\n\n\u201cRecord investments in renewables are associated with falling reliability and rising prices,\u201d Taylor told an energy conference in Sydney. The states of Victoria and South Australia were in the \u201cdanger zone,\u201d where dispatchable generation capacity had fallen below levels required to meet peak demand.\n\nAustralia gets around two-thirds of its power from coal, and with several aging coal plants scheduled to retire over the next decade, the nation either needs replacements that offer the same level of reliability and affordability, or life extensions for existing plants, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cThe objective is clear,\u201d he said, adding on the sidelines that he\u2019s focused on cost-effective outcomes, rather than supporting specific technology or fuels.\n\nAustralia is likely to need around A$400 billion ($270 billion) in new utility-scale generation assets over the next 30 years, according to a report Tuesday by the Grattan Institute, a public policy think tank. The industry broadly agrees that more dispatchable power is needed to back up renewables, but has been frustrated by the lack of clear policy directions from government to promote investment. \u201cA decade of policy inertia\u201d has made it difficult for boards to commit to investing in long-dated assets, Origin Energy Chief Executive Officer Frank Calabria said at the same conference. \u201cRight now, the price of firming energy is not enough to ensure that what we need to make the system reliable will be built.\u201d\n\nCalabria added that the government\u2019s \u201cbig stick\u201d energy legislation, which was re-introduced to parliament last month and carries the threat to break up companies that combine retail and generation, was acting as a \u201chand-brake\u201d on much-needed investment.\n\nKerry Schott, chair of the Energy Security Board, which was set up by national and state governments to oversee energy market reform, said adding new \u201cflexible and firm\u201d generation should be a priority, but coal wasn\u2019t the answer. Inflexible coal-fired power stations, which have to keep running during the day even amid abundant solar power, were \u201cdinosaurs\u201d that would become increasingly redundant in the transition to clean power.\n\nThe government is backing two major energy infrastructure projects aimed at boosting grid reliability: the A$5 billion Snowy pumped-hydro project and a new transmission link between the island state of Tasmania and the mainland. It also plans to underwrite a raft of new generation projects, most of them either hydro of gas-peaking plants.", "description": "Energy minister says renewables are reducing power supply reliability, but a critic says coal is a 'dinosaur'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/00cc9f5f48974dd292aa24c9ee2200ee_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
