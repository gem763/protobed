The recent rally has been fast, and some names have done better than others. Today\u2019s top stock trades center around the banks.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #1: iShares TLT Bond ETF\n\ntop stock trades for TLT More\n\nNo one seems to care about the buybacks, dividends and low valuations from the banks. But one big driver has been rates, and thus, bonds. So let\u2019s look at the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) first.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe TLT has demanded plenty of traders\u2019 attention since the beginning of August. That\u2019s when bonds began to explode higher to the upside, rallying from $132 to $148 in just a few weeks.\n\nThe ETF twice topped out in the $148+ area, and has now retreated in five of the past six sessions. Investors who are looking for a long trade in TLT may consider buying on a test of the 50-day moving average. That\u2019s a reasonable risk/reward area with $137.50 just below.\n\nNotice how the recent decline in TLT has helped pave the way for a run higher in the banks? If you\u2019re not trading TLT, that\u2019s great, but consider keeping the ETF up on the monitor for a clue on what\u2019s going on with the banks.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #2: Bank of America\n\ntop stock trades for BAC More\n\nRemember a few weeks ago when we flagged the long trade in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)? We liked this setup because of the reasonable risk/reward BAC stock was presenting buyers, as it bobbed near range support between $26 and $26.50.\n\nNow pushing toward $30, longs are likely considering booking some profits near current levels. I want to see if BAC stock can press into range resistance between $30.50 and $31.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #3: Citigroup\n\ntop stock trades for BAC More\n\nCitigroup (NYSE:C) has a very similar setup, bouncing off $61 range support and now trying to hurdle $70. If it can, it puts a retest of $72 on the table, with a possible run up to trend resistance (blue line).\n\nOn the downside, longs will want to see the 50-day moving average hold as support.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #4: JPMorgan\n\ntop stock trades for JPM More\n\nLike the two previous banks, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) held range support near $104. However, this one has a lot more \u201coomph\u201d than the two above.\n\nShares are already over $116 range resistance and making new highs. I\u2019d love to see JPM continue higher, turning trend resistance (blue line) into trend support.\n\nAt the very least though, see that $116 holds as support from here. Below could usher in a flush down to the 50-day moving average.\n\nRemember, as hot as some of these banks have been, they are still coming into or are near key resistance levels. In the past, these levels have held them in check, even when the news has been bullish. So stay disciplined, don\u2019t be greedy and let price guide your decision making \u2014 not your bias! Resistance will either break and lead to higher prices or hold steady and send stocks lower.", "description": "The S&P 500 is flirting with new all-time highs.
