He sees only the power \u2014 and how it can benefit just one person: Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nOur first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie. President Trump seemingly cannot tell the truth \u2014 about anything. He slanders anyone he sees as a threat. That is why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family, no doubt hoping to undermine my candidacy for the presidency.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the same cynical playbook he returns to again and again. But this time, it won\u2019t work, because the American people know me \u2014 and they know him. I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against Trump\u2019s lack of integrity any day of the week.\n\nAD\n\nIt all comes down to the abuse of power. That is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency.\n\nWe now know he has abused the foreign policy of the United States in an attempt to extract political favors from multiple countries. He has directly asked three foreign governments to interfere in U.S. elections, including Russia, one of our greatest adversaries, and China, our closest competitor. He has corrupted the agencies of his administration \u2014 including the State Department, the National Security Council staff, the Justice Department and the office of the vice president \u2014 to do his personal political bidding. We also know that the people around him in the White House recognized just how profoundly wrong it was and worked overtime to cover up Trump\u2019s abuses.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nThankfully, someone had the courage to blow the whistle. In America, not even the president is above the law. That\u2019s a founding principle of our nation and our system of government.\n\nAD\n\nThis isn\u2019t just an academic exercise in political theory. A president who puts his self-interest ahead of the public good and the nation\u2019s security poses a threat to the daily lives of every American.\n\nJust days after the House of Representatives opened an impeachment inquiry against him, Trump hosted the president of the National Rifle Association in the Oval Office. Did they discuss the common-sense gun-safety legislation the nation so desperately needs? No \u2014 they talked about how the NRA can help reelect Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s so deep in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry, he\u2019s literally sacrificing the planet\u2019s future for personal political gain. He pulled out of the Paris climate agreement and froze fuel economy standards the Obama-Biden administration put in place for cars, and he\u2019s preventing California from implementing its own higher standards. He won\u2019t even acknowledge the climate crisis that he is making worse every day.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn his phone call in June with Chinese President Xi Jinping \u2014 in addition to seeking his involvement in our election, which he then publicly repeated \u2014 Trump reportedly sold out the people of Hong Kong, who for months have been rallying in the streets for the democratic rights they are owed.\n\nAmerica\u2019s word and our standing in the world are in free fall because of the actions and incompetence of this president.\n\nIt is easy to be distracted by Trump\u2019s daily outrages \u2014 to become obsessed with them or numb to them, or to normalize behavior that Americans would not have tolerated in any of the previous presidents in the nation\u2019s history. Not me. While the House does its job on impeachment, I\u2019m going to stay focused on what matters: remaking education so every child in the country is equipped to succeed in the 21st century; getting weapons of war off the streets and ending the epidemic of gun violence; building on Obamacare so that every American has access to quality, affordable health care; taking on the climate emergency imperiling the planet; and much more. I\u2019m going to fight to ensure that the United States is once again the leader of the free world; a champion of democracy; and the bulwark of a stable, peaceful international order.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd to Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I\u2019m not going anywhere. You won\u2019t destroy me, and you won\u2019t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump\u2019s corruption is black and white\n\nKathleen Parker: Trump\u2019s \u2018favor\u2019 may not seem worse than Biden\u2019s threat.
