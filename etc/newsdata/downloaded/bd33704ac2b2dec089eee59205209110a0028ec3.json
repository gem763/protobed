He then followed the ambassador back to Moscow in 2008, when Ushakov was appointed foreign policy adviser to Putin. Ushakov declined to comment when asked on Thursday if he knew Smolenkov.\n\nCNN said that the alleged CIA spy had been feeding information to the United States for decades, and had direct contact with Putin. It also said he had confirmed to US intelligence that Russia\u2019s president oversaw the Kremlin\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 American presidential elections that brought Trump to power.\n\nZakharova said the US media reports were linked to American domestic politics before next year\u2019s presidential vote. \u201cThis is classic propaganda,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Kremlin confirmed this week that Smolenkov had worked in the presidential administration, but said he had been fired several years ago and did not have access to Putin. Dmitry Peskov, Putin\u2019s spokesman, called the CNN report \u201cpulp fiction\u201d.\n\nFranz Klintsevich, a member of the Russian upper house\u2019s defense and security committee, said CNN\u2019s story was \u201ca fake\u201d aimed at discrediting Trump by portraying him as incompetent and \u201ccapable of ruining almost the entire US intelligence network with his awkward actions\u201d.\n\nOn Friday, RTVi, a New York-based Russian-language media outlet, published a photograph of a man it said was Smolenkov.\n\nIt also published an interview with a man named Yevgeny Agafonov, who said he was the former husband of Smolenkov\u2019s wife, Antonina, and the father of her eldest child, Ivan. Agafonov accused the Smolenkovs of taking the boy to the United States without his permission. He said he had not spoken to his son since June 2017.", "description": "Suspected mole named as Oleg Smolenkov reportedly whisked to safety by US intelligence agents during holiday in Montenegro in 2017", "authors": ["Marc Bennetts"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/971cb91eac8847885a1e97e7f93adb1073b99303/3_173_507_304/master/507.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ec36b04ecb159e2d22423df6ff546cbf", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
