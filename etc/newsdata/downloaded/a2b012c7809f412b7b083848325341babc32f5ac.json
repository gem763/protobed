My focus is on this: If you vote New Democrat, you're going to get someone on your side.\"\n\nWhen pressed on Tuesday by Lynch to clarify whether he would consider negotiating some coalition arrangement with the Liberals, Singh left the door open.\n\n\"I've only ruled out one party \u2014 I said I would not work with the Conservatives \u2014 so I've always been open to working with others,\" he said.\n\nSingh greets supporters during a campaign stop in Brampton, Ont., on Oct. 12. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)\n\nJabs at Trudeau\n\nBut that didn't stop Singh from being highly critical of Justin Trudeau and the Liberal party, telling The Current that while Trudeau may \"talk the good talk,\" he believed the Liberal leader had favoured powerful corporate interests over fulfilling his campaign promises.\n\nSingh alleged that Trudeau had abandoned his pledges to end fossil fuel subsidies and lower drug prices after meeting with oil and gas and pharmaceutical lobbyists hundreds of times.\n\nCBC News previously looked into the claim, and was not able to independently verify it.\n\n\"He makes nice promises when he's campaigning,\" Singh said. \"Then he meets with the powerful lobbyists and abandons those promises.\"\n\nBut Singh said that these criticisms would not preclude him from working with Trudeau in government. He said that if enough New Democrats were elected, he believed they would have the power within a coalition to push through the kinds of policy changes they want to see, like a national dental care program.\n\nJustin Trudeau brushed aside questions about the possibility of forming a coalition government with the NDP, while Andrew Scheer used the speculation to ask voters for a Conservative majority. (The Canadian Press)\n\nTrudeau, on the other hand, brushed aside suggestions that he would consider a coalition in the event of a Conservative minority win.\n\n\"In terms of the NDP and the Greens, remember this: If you want progressive action, you need a progressive government, not a progressive opposition,\" he said in Fredericton on Tuesday.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer appeared to be using coalition speculation to boost his case for a Conservative majority.\n\n\"There is now a clear choice between our party and an NDP-Liberal coalition which will raise taxes, kill jobs, drive out investment, cancel big projects,\" he said Tuesday in Quebec City.\n\nChanging 'hearts and minds' on Bill 21\n\nSingh has faced criticism for refusing to say he would intervene on Quebec's controversial Bill 21, which bans public servants from wearing religious clothing at work.\n\nHe defended his stance to The Current, saying that as a lawyer he feels \"it's important not to have political interference with this court challenge that the people of Quebec are raising.\"\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh speaks about his battle against discrimination after Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau challenges him to say he'll intervene on Quebec's secularism law. 1:15\n\nHe added that, as a majority of Quebecers currently support the religious symbols, he believed that fighting the law without first changing public opinion would backfire.\n\n\"If 70 per cent of people believe it's the right thing to do, they're going to find a way to bring it back,\" he said.\n\nInstead, he said, he prefers to sway opinions in Quebec by demonstrating that he shares values espoused by many Quebecers, including his support for same-sex marriage and women's reproductive rights.\n\n\"You're not going to be able to build a better society unless you change and win over the hearts and minds of people,\" he said.\n\nWritten by Allie Jaynes.
