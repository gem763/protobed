What a patriot.\n\nIn the intervening period, that bile has turned into raw hydrochloric stomach acid as the ugly reality of the project has been revealed. The exposure of the lies that were told by Boris Johnson and his chums during the campaign has simply led to an escalating spiral of increasingly aggressive falsehood.\n\nThose who have sought to point that out have been shouted down, and sometimes worse. Religious fundamentalists of whatever stripe would do well to dip into the playbook of the Brexit crew.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Much has been written about Johnson\u2019s character, or lack of it, and how it influences the way he approaches the job. But for the answer, you only really need to look at what Carrie Symonds was reportedly heard saying at their home during their infamous row in the midst of the Tory leadership campaign: \u201cYou just don\u2019t care for anything because you\u2019re spoilt. You have no care for money or anything.\u201d Prophetic indeed. What we\u2019ve seen reflects that: the \"Johnnywise\" approach to diplomacy has involved stomping around making demands while throwing hissy fits when they\u2019re not met.\n\nThe most recent example: the UK\u2019s withdrawal from most EU meetings in the wake of Donald Tusk\u2019s withering response to his latest letter. He\u2019s making Britain look like a toddler in need of referral to a behavioural support unit.\n\nEven in a part of the world where the broadband makes my own home's one-room service look good, it was impossible to entirely escape the unpleasant news flow emanating from home. I was daft enough to take my mobile (because, you know, we get cheap roaming through the EU). The downside of that was Apple News pushing headlines containing details of the latest threat or tantrum.\n\nBut in the end I saw no need to hide. Was I embarrassed? No. Angry? Yes \u2013 hopping mad, in fact. After all, as an insulin dependent diabetic, I\u2019m one of those dismissed as a \u201cbump in the road\u201d by Johnson and a certain Michael Gove. I require life-saving medication that this \"minister for no-deal\" is threatening to deny me.\n\nThere have been suggestions that opponents of no-deal Brexit \u2013 for which the prime minister has no democratic mandate \u2013 have given up and started to bow to the inevitability. I find that inexplicable and also infuriating. They need to wake up: lives like mine are being needlessly put at risk thanks to our mess of a prime minister and his friends.", "description": "Shortly after the Brexit vote, I wrote about feeling slightly embarrassed as a Brit going abroad in the wake of the nationalist bile it had unleashed.
