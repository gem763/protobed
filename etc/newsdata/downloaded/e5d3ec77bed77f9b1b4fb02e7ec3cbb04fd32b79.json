She saw kids were entering the criminal justice system in many cases because of the challenges they faced at home. She also saw a significant need for foster parents and adoptive families in her community, caused largely by the opioid and meth crises. Stephanie knew she needed to get involved.\n\nAlong with her husband Craig, Stephanie earned her foster parenting license and began welcoming children in need into her home. During her first year as a foster parent, she met Sara, an energetic and fearless two-year-old. From the moment Sara came into their lives, Stephanie and Craig knew they couldn\u2019t let her go. This April, they officially adopted Sara and gave her a forever home that includes a baby brother, a dog and a family full of love.\n\nWe\u2019re currently observing National Adoption Week. It\u2019s a time reserved for raising awareness of the urgent need for increased adoption in our country. There are thousands of children in Iowa and nationwide in foster care waiting to be adopted, and it\u2019s critical we don\u2019t forget about these deserving kids and do what we can to help and support them.\n\nAs the co-founder and co-chair of the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, my work is inspired and informed by Iowans like Stephanie. The number of children in foster care continues to rise year after year, with over 442,000 children in foster care currently. In Iowa, the number of children in care increased by 7 percent from 2016 to 2017. Many factors contribute to the rise in the need for foster care and adoptive families, but one pressing reason is addiction. The opioid and meth crises have significantly affected communities across Iowa, leading to unstable living conditions for thousands of children.\n\nWith such a strong connection between addiction and child neglect and abuse, it\u2019s critical that we address some of the root causes that lead to children entering the foster care system. In response to this crisis, Congress has passed legislation to provide more tools for families struggling with addiction. For example, the Family First Prevention Services Act provides access to services designed to keep families safely together, such as substance abuse treatment counseling and mental health services. It works by allowing states to use child welfare funding that\u2019s typically only available after a child has already been placed in foster care. Congress also passed the Building Capacity for Family Focused Residential Treatment Act, a bill I introduced that became law in 2018. This law authorizes funding to support families struggling with substance abuse and helps improve the well-being of children by making sure more programs serve parents and children at the same time.\n\nThough the goal is always to keep families together, it is not always possible. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that adoption be straightforward and efficient. In 2008, I introduced and Congress passed the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act. This law provides more support for states to move children from foster care to adoptive homes. It also makes it easier for foster children to be permanently cared for by their own relatives. Foster care was never meant to be a permanent destination for a child, and this law has helped children get out of foster care and into their forever homes.\n\nI\u2019ve also been involved in other important steps we\u2019ve taken to help children in foster care, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The law preserved the Adoption Tax Credit, making it easier for families who want to adopt children from foster care to do so. Earlier this year, along with Sen. Gary Peters Gary Charles PetersRepublican challenger to Gary Peters in Michigan raises over million Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Planned Parenthood charges into 2020 | PhRMA CEO warns against Pelosi drug pricing bill | Medicaid work requirements costing states millions Bipartisan senators want federal plan for sharing more info on supply chain threats MORE (D-Mich.), I reintroduced the Childhood Outcomes Need New Efficient Community Teams (CONNECT) Act. As Stephanie saw firsthand as an attorney representing minors in the justice system, there is a significant overlap of children both in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems. This bill authorizes grants to help these two systems collect data on children involved with both to increase our understanding of the challenges they face and improve the agencies\u2019 ability to effectively help these at-risk children.\n\nFoster parents also play an important role in our society. A loving and nurturing home is essential for future generations to learn, grow and become productive members of society. If you feel you can open your heart and home to a child in foster care, I urge you to learn more at adoptuskids.org. Whether it\u2019s providing school supplies to families in need, opening your heart and home to foster youth or, like Stephanie, giving a child their forever home, you can be the one to make a difference in a child\u2019s life.\n\nGrassley is the senior senator from Iowa and co-founder and co-chair of the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth.", "description": "There are thousands of children in Iowa and nationwide in foster care waiting to be adopted, and it\u2019s critical we don\u2019t forget about these deserving kids and do what we can to help and support them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/fostercare_istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
