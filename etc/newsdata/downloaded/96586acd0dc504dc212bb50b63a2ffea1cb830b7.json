Corn Pop, who actually was real, supposedly carried a straight razor and after an altercation with young lifeguard Biden threatened to meet him in the parking lot later\u2014so young Biden claims he threatened to wrap a chain around Corn Pop\u2019s head.\n\nThe whole blowup was over Biden allegedly calling Corn Pop \u201cEsther,\u201d a derisive insult drawn from the swimmer Esther Williams that apparently was akin to calling the gangster a girl. But before things devolved into a razor-versus-chain race war in the parking lot later, Biden says he apologized to Corn Pop for the insult, which defused the situation\u2014and the incident has become part of Biden\u2019s political folklore storyline of being a grand negotiator who can calmly lead in tense political situations, especially those involving race.\n\nThough it seems an incredible story, Biden included it in his 2007 autobiography and it was a central part of a dedication ceremony at a Delaware public pool at which Biden spoke in 2017. The NAACP even confirmed the details of Corn Pop and his existence for those questioning it.\n\nSo when moderator Anderson Cooper at the end of the CNN-New York Times debate on Tuesday night closed down the debate with a question about a unique and different friendship that has shaped their lives, one would have thought the moderators were teeing Biden up for a perfect Corn Pop moment.\n\nCooper said:\n\nLast week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, we\u2019re all different and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s OK that we\u2019re all different. So in that spirit, we\u2019d like you to tell us about a friendship that you\u2019ve had that would surprise us and what impact it\u2019s had on you and your beliefs.\n\nCooper went to all 11 other candidates before getting to Biden, who closed it down at the end, giving Biden plenty of time to think about what he was going to say.\n\nInstead of telling the story of Corn Pop, Biden opted for a more conventional and boring answer, and one already used by several of the other candidates: He talked about his friendship with the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ):\n\nThis is reassuring in the fact that we\u2019re all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country. The two people maybe would surprise you the most were \u2014 he\u2019s been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was \u2014 he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children. And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, \u2018John, you didn\u2019t see a war you never wanted to fight.\u2019 And he\u2019d say, \u2018You didn\u2019t see a problem you never wanted to solve.\u2019 But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable.\n\nBiden finished with typical talking points from his stump speech about why he\u2019s running for president\u2014nothing remarkable, nothing outstanding, and nothing memorable.\n\nSome pundits and observers on Twitter laughed about Biden leaving Corn Pop hanging in favor of the safer McCain story, mocking Biden for being unable to read the room.\n\nCooper: Who were your surprise friends Klobuchar: McCain\n\nHarris: Rand\n\nBernie: McCain\n\nWarren: My brothers\n\nBiden: I'M GONNA DO THE CORN POP STORY!!!!! #DemDebates \u2014 David M. Perry (@Lollardfish) October 16, 2019\n\n\ud83d\udde3Let me tell you about my shocking friend Corn Pop \u2014 Caity Weaver (@caityweaver) October 16, 2019\n\ni hope Biden picks corn pop for his surprising friendship \u2014 tracy s. rumpkins (@brokeymcpoverty) October 16, 2019\n\nplease let Biden answer the \"name a weird friend you have\" with \"Corn Pop\" \u2014 Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) October 16, 2019\n\nMissed opportunity to invoke Corn Pop \u2014 Ellen McGirt (@ellmcgirt) October 16, 2019\n\nWhile this is more of a lighthearted ribbing of Biden, in an unserious and comedic manner\u2014Corn Pop probably was not the right story anyway for the question\u2014it does illustrate a larger problem with the sliding campaign of the former Vice President.\n\nHe again had no major memorable positive moments on a crowded debate stage for the fourth month in a row. Donald Trump, Jr., President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son, mocked Biden\u2019s lackluster performance in a tweet by noting that, at least this time in the Ohio deba, Biden\u2019s teeth didn\u2019t nearly fall out\u2014as they almost did in the previous debate.\n\nOn the bright side, at least Joe\u2019s teeth didn\u2019t fall out this time! \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 16, 2019\n\nIt seems cruel, but Biden\u2019s teeth did slip and nearly fall out of his mouth in a previous debate, and in a forum his eye exploded, bleeding on live television. Another candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), suffered a heart attack less than two weeks before this debate, pushing health questions\u2013like whether any of these Democrats are actually healthy enough to run for and serve as president\u2013to the forefront of Americans\u2019 minds heading into Tuesday night. Moderators even asked several of the candidates about these concerns in Ohio\u2019s debate.\n\nThis all comes as it has been revealed by just-released Federal Election Commission (FEC) campaign finance reports that Biden\u2019s campaign spent more than he raised in funds last quarter, and he keeps slipping in polls behind rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and now lags in the fundraising race as well.\n\nThe bigger story that broke during the debate news cycle in its immediate aftermath is Biden spent nearly $2 million more than he raised last quarter\u2014he raised $15.7 million and spent $17.6 million\u2014while he had less than $9 million cash on hand at the end of September. That puts him at less than Sanders\u2019 $33.7 million, less than Warren\u2019s $25.7 million, less than Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s $23.4 million, and even less than the $10.5 million that the flaming-out Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) had.\n\nNEWS: Joe Biden has $8.98 million cash on hand Sanders: $33.7 million\n\nWarren: $25.7 million\n\nButtigieg: $23.4 million\n\nHarris: $10.5 million \u2014 Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) October 16, 2019\n\nAt a burn rate like Biden\u2019s running, with not much gas in the tank, the former Vice President could be in some serious trouble in attempting to remain near the front of the pack. He\u2019s already lost his frontrunner status, as Warren has pulled ahead of him in most national polling and in almost every early and battleground state except in the South. CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza called Biden\u2019s funding lapses a \u201cbombshell\u201d revelation multiple times in a post about the matter, writing that it represents a \u201cSIREN\u201d for Biden\u2019s campaign.\n\nFactor that together with burgeoning attacks on his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings from the White House and President Donald Trump, as well as a media beginning to be receptive to the criticisms, and Joe Biden has a tougher-than-ever road ahead. Hunter Biden\u2019s interview earlier on Tuesday on ABC did his father no favors by most accounts, and even CNN and JournoList founder Ezra Klein of Vox are now saying there is something to all the questions swirling around him and that Democrats need to be prepared to deal with this.\n\nCNN published a fact check after the debate contrasting Biden\u2019s claims he never discussed Hunter\u2019s business dealings with his son with Hunter\u2019s claims he did discuss them with his father.\n\nFACT CHECK: Joe Biden claims he never discussed Ukraine dealings with his son. But his son indicated otherwise. #DemDebate https://t.co/YMbj1PNtcE pic.twitter.com/boHZmIW3Eb \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 16, 2019\n\nKlein, meanwhile, laid out in a Vox article how Democrats are woefully unprepared on the Hunter Biden issue should Joe Biden win the nomination, urging Democrats to learn how to talk about it, even if they don\u2019t want to discuss the problems. Klein wrote:\n\nA few things are true about the Hunter Biden story. One is that there\u2019s no evidence Joe Biden did what Donald Trump has accused him of doing: pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect his son from investigation. But another is that Hunter Biden poses real problems for Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, and if Democrats pretend otherwise, they\u2019re making a mistake. Many Democrats consider raising the Hunter Biden question unfair to Joe Biden. Why should he have to answer for the legal actions of his adult son? But no one said politics was fair. And if Democrats avoid the issue, they can be certain Trump will not. Biden\u2019s vulnerability here needs to be tested in the primary, when Democrats have other choices, rather than in the general, when they won\u2019t.\n\nThe debate moderators and other candidates barely touched on Hunter Biden during the debate, and only to brush it aside as a non-concern. But Hunter Biden is hardly the only of Joe Biden\u2019s problems after the debate on Tuesday.\n\nThere was a particularly memorable moment where, towards the end of the night, both Sanders and Warren extracted a pound of flesh from Biden from the left\u2014significantly undermining his standing with Democrats.\n\nCooper asked Biden to respond to the broad visions of big, bold change that Warren and Sanders respectively have been laying out:\n\nVice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?\n\nBiden replied with a claim he is the only one who has gotten anything substantive actually \u201cdone\u201d in Washington:\n\nWell, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Senator Warren said we can\u2019t be running any vague campaigns. We\u2019ve got to level with people. We\u2019ve got to level with people and tell them exactly what we\u2019re going to do, how we\u2019re going to get it done, and if you can get it done. I\u2019m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I\u2019m the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression, making us \u2014 putting us in a position where I was able to end roe \u2014 excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons. And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I\u2019m not suggesting they can\u2019t, but I\u2019m suggesting that that\u2019s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it\u2019s going to cost, how you\u2019re going to do it, and why you\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.\n\nAfter a follow-up question from Cooper asking Biden to further specify exactly whom he said was being \u201cvague,\u201d he took a not-so-veiled shot at the Medicare-for-All vision put forward by Warren and Sanders.\n\nBiden said:\n\nWell, the senator said \u2014 she\u2019s being vague on the issue of \u2014 actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, here\u2019s the deal. Come on. It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That\u2019s over $3 trillion \u2014 it\u2019s more than the entire federal budget\u2026 If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing, plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you \u2014 it would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from?\n\nThat opened Sanders up to decimate Biden for \u201cworking with Republicans\u201d to back endless wars in the Middle East and trade policies that hurt America\u2019s working class:\n\nJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs. Now, let\u2019s get to Medicare for all. Let\u2019s be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is to guarantee care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profit.\n\nAfter back-and-forth between Biden and Sanders in response to Sanders\u2019 smack-down, Warren delivered another brutal blow to Biden. Warren\u2019s reply focused on the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, with which she was intricately involved and for which she receives enormous credit among Democrats:\n\nSo you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don\u2019t even try, because you will never get it passed. And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight for the things that touch people\u2019s lives.\n\nButtigieg, who had sparred all night with Warren, seemed to sense what was coming next for Biden and attempted to interrupt to spare the former vice president any more pain from the socialists on either side of him. But Biden didn\u2019t take the life raft from South Bend\u2019s mayor, opting instead to further engage with Warren on the 2008 financial crisis. Biden, after fighting the moderators to respond to Warren, attempted to take credit for whipping U.S. Senate votes for the legislation that created the CFPB.\n\n\u201cI agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d\n\nBig mistake for Biden, as evidenced by the leftists on Twitter ripping him for \u201cyelling\u201d at Warren, lecturing the former college professor on her subject of expertise and claiming she couldn\u2019t have done it without his work whipping votes for her project.\n\nI know I'm supposed to be commenting on this debate but honestly I blacked out when Joe Biden interrupted Elizabeth Warren to demand credit for the agency THAT SHE CREATED so I've pretty much missed the last 15 mins \u2014 Draculeah Greenberg (@Leahgreenb) October 16, 2019\n\nThe fight over the CFPB was my daily beat for basically a year. I don't remember Joe Biden being involved whatsoever. His adviser Jared Bernstein was a strong supporter but Biden was 100% AWOL. It was well known he and Warren clashed, so it made sense he stayed out. #DemDebate \u2014 Ryan Grim (@ryangrim) October 16, 2019\n\nOk now that it\u2019s been a few minutes can I just say that Biden shouldn\u2019t yell at Warren like that again. Not a good look. \u2014 Zerlina Maxwell (@ZerlinaMaxwell) October 16, 2019\n\nThe fact that Biden yelled at Warren, \u201cI got you the votes!\u201d speaks to everything we know about peak white male fragility. #DemDebate \u2014 Preston Mitchum (@PrestonMitchum) October 16, 2019\n\nThat set Warren up for the line of the night, when Cooper gave the spotlight back to her to reply to Biden.\n\n\u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,\u201d Warren said.\n\nHoly crap, Elizabeth Warren responds with Joe Biden snapping at her about his role in getting votes for the CFPB by thanking Obama. Whoosh.#DemocraticDebatepic.twitter.com/dAOtNuLvAL \u2014 Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) October 16, 2019\n\nWarren thanking former President Barack Obama, but not Biden, was brutal to Biden. Obama has not endorsed his former vice president in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary, deliberately not supporting his one-time wingman. That void for Biden and lack of support from the Democrats\u2019 most popular star, the former president\u2014despite Biden\u2019s best efforts to closely associate himself with Obama at every turn\u2014cuts like a dagger into his support.\n\nIt raises all sorts of questions among Democrats, including most importantly about Biden\u2019s electability, about why they should vote for Biden if Obama won\u2019t even endorse and campaign with him. Making matters worse for Biden is that, the morning after this debate, Obama turned around and endorsed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s re-election north of the border\u2014but still refuses to back his own former right-hand guy.\n\nI was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term. \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cYou did a hell of a job in your job,\u201d Biden interrupted Warren\u2019s answer.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Warren coolly replied to laughter from the audience. She continued:\n\nBut understand this. It was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept. I said, no, let\u2019s go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.\n\n\u201cAnd President Obama said, I will fight for that, and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration,\u201d Warren continued before Biden interrupted her again.\n\n\u201cNot me!\u201d Biden protested, as Warren refused to credit him with any involvement in the response to the financial crisis.\n\nWarren kept plowing through her answer, ignoring Biden\u2019s protests.\n\n\u201cWe have to be willing to make good, big, structural change,\u201d she said.\n\nBy Wednesday, Biden seems to have realized just how bad Tuesday\u2019s debate was for his campaign, as before he even left Ohio he was out ripping Sanders and Warren to anyone in the press who would listen, accusing them of \u201cplaying Trump\u2019s game and trying to con the American people.\u201d\n\nHe ripped Sanders and Warren for not being able to explain how they would pay for their mass increases in government benefits and claimed both were disingenuous.\n\nMeanwhile, the establishment media keeps playing up Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) as candidates they say had big nights, as Democrats desperately look for someone to be able to effectively counter Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 socialist vision\u2014all while establishment-favorite blasts from the past like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the 2016 Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton are discussed as potential Democrat saviors from the leftist socialist abyss.", "description": "Pundits joked that when Biden gave his final answer in the Democrat debate, he missed an opportunity to tell the story of \u201cCorn Pop\u201d again.", "authors": ["Matthew Boyle"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Joe-Biden-pointing-debate-October-15-2019-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
