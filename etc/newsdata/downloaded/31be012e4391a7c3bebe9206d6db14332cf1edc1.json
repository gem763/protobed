Well, my friends, you know it. It's you. When Republican senators protest what the president has done, he sometimes acts,\" Schumer said from the Senate floor.\n\nUnder the Senate's rules, any one senator can request to vote on or pass a bill. But because that requires the signoff of every senator, any one lawmaker can block the request.\n\nPaul, a libertarian-leaning GOP senator, argued that if Congress is going to take up a resolution opposing Trump's Syria decision, it needs to have a larger war powers debate.\n\n\"If Democrats want to send our young men and women to fight in the Syrian civil war, let's have that debate. By all means, let's have the constitutional debate today on the Senate floor right here, right now,\" Paul said.\n\nIt also calls on Turkey to end its military action, calls on the United States to protect the Kurds and calls on the White House \"to present a clear and specific plan for the enduring defeat of ISIS.\"\n\nIt's the second time Paul has blocked the resolution from getting a vote. Schumer made the same request last week before the Kentucky Republican held it up.\n\nSchumer argued on Tuesday that Paul's understanding of what requires a declaration of war is \"different than 99.9 percent of America and from every other single person in this chamber.\"\n\nPaul fired back that if the United States was trying to \"create a Kurdish homeland ... hell yes we need a debate and a vote and authorization of force.\"\n\n\"It's an utter and complete mess,\" he added. \"It is time we get the hell out.\"\n\nBut the GOP leader has panned the House-passed resolution and introduced his own competing measure on Tuesday.\n\nMcConnell said the House measure was \u201cbadly insufficient.\u201d He added that it was \u201csilent\u201d on the U.S. military presence in Syria and that \u201cperhaps the goal was to paper over disagreements within the Democratic Party.\u201d", "description": "Sen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/paulrand_073118gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
