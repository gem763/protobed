Usher\n\nFollowers of R&B have known the name Summer Walker for a minute now; the Atlanta-based artist has been bubbling up ever since she made a viral mashup hit in 2017 and released her first project Last Day of Summer in 2018, with a boost from an ensuing Drake feature. Walker is now primed for the big stage with her new debut album Over It. \u201cCome Thru,\u201d with the ever-smooth Usher, is silky but catchy contemporary R&B, instantly likable. A trap beat never steals focus from Walker\u2019s endlessly flexible voice. And Usher? He\u2019s still cool.\n\n\u201cNice to Meet Ya,\u201d Niall Horan\n\nOn his debut solo project Flicker, former One Directioner Horan won himself independent success by sticking to a folksy, acoustic sound that distanced him from his boy-band past and leaned into his Irish singer-songwriter image. \u201cNice to Meet Ya,\u201d the new single off his upcoming sophomore project, switches things up again. The tune is grounded by his easygoing hum and a confident, low-key lyrical delivery, but it\u2019s a pop song through and through, with a catchy rock inflection to boot. Horan has said that he was in a different headspace while writing this album than the one that inspired the reflective melancholy of Flicker; \u201cNice to Meet Ya\u201d suggests we\u2019re in for a fun ride.\n\n\u201cNew Love Cassette,\u201d Angel Olsen\n\nFor her fifth album, Angel Olsen presents a collection of songs grounded in her indie folk tones, written during a self-imposed exile in the Pacific Northwest. But it\u2019s the 12-piece string section, which shines on \u201cNew Love Cassette,\u201d that may surprise fans. Olsen gives the orchestration and voice parts room to breathe, not just using them to heighten emotional stakes. Consider the end of the song, which sees both Olsen and the instruments level up octave by octave, seemingly testing one another until they fade into a sweet, quiet outro. It\u2019s an achingly intense love song: \u201cGonna show you love all of the time / Gonna be your breath when you\u2019re out of life.\u201d But in that moment, it\u2019s also a lover\u2019s lullaby.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The teen indie-pop star on the rise makes music that\u2019s achingly vulnerable and cuts straight to the core. The kicker: he\u2019s got a lovely voice, too. \u201cBody\u201d sees him explore insecurities in an affecting sing-song. \u201cYou know how I feel about my body, all the ripples and tears,\u201d he confides: \u201cWhy can\u2019t I see me in the way that they all do / when I\u2019m looking in the mirror?\u201d Dunbar first caught attention last year for his debut album balloons don\u2019t float here; \u201cbody\u201d is a worthy follow-up as the artist doubles down on what makes him unique.\n\n\u201cRome,\u201d Dermot Kennedy\n\nFor four years now, Dermot Kennedy has been doing the work: he started out as a street busker in his native Ireland, working his way up to sold-out shows in venues across the U.S. and Europe. Now, he has finally released his debut album, Without Fear. Kennedy\u2019s is a powerful voice; his music scratches emotional itches, built on a foundation of intense nostalgia and heartache. \u201cRome,\u201d one of the new tracks on the album, bemoans a lost love with his signature intensity: \u201cMidnight drives when you\u2019d sing / I\u2019d play you songs you were in / I just want to be there again.\u201d Written out like this, it seems simple enough. But Kennedy\u2019s verses help us dwell with him in the bittersweetness of those in-between moments. His way of articulating and singing through pain offers us a way to feel things a little more fully.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.", "description": "New music from Summer Walker, Angel Olsen, Niall Horan, Isaac Dunbar and Dermot Kennedy.", "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/angel-olsen.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
