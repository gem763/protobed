We have fought a lot, and the fighting still continues today.\"\n\nLike most of the Taliban supporters AFP spoke to, Wali worried about whether the group would be able to make a separate agreement with the Afghan government.\n\n\"Our main concern is how the Taliban and the Afghan government make peace,\" he said.\n\n\"Afghans have been fighting with each other for years in the villages and districts. Will they sit together? This is not just my concern, but other villagers are also worried about it.\"\n\nUntil now, the Taliban have refused to talk to the administration of President Ashraf Ghani, whom they view as a US stooge.\n\nThe upcoming withdrawal deal with the Taliban is expected to require \"intra-Afghan\" talks between the insurgents and Kabul.\n\n- 'Defeated' America -\n\nMullah Gul Agha, a Taliban commander from the Marja district of Helmand province, another insurgent stronghold, said Afghans would never accept foreigners as their \"masters\".\n\n\"The Afghans have been fighting invaders for decades, once it was the Russians, today it is the Americans and the British,\" Agha said.\n\n\"With the Help of Almighty Allah, we have defeated them again.\"\n\nThe toll the war has taken on the US military -- more than 2,400 US troops killed in combat and thousands more with horrendous wounds -- would make America think twice before invading other countries, he said.\n\n\"Afghans accept a poor, humble life, but never anybody as their masters,\" he said.\n\n- Both sides 'tired' -\n\nMullah Rauf, who was once a Taliban commander in the central province of Ghazni, was optimistic peace might finally come to Afghanistan after 18 years of conflict.\n\n\"Both sides in this war are tired,\" he said.\n\n\"I am very happy America is leaving, because they didn't give Afghans anything but war and destruction, and thousands of Afghans were killed... If Afghans join hands, they can prevent more destruction and bloodshed.\"", "description": "Taliban loyalists are cheering the prospect of a deal with the US that after 18 years of gruelling conflict will see \"defeated\" American \"invaders\" finally go home.
