It includes the Nissan Altima, Frontier, Kicks, Leaf, Maxima, Murano, NV, NV200, Pathfinder, Rogue, Rogue Sport, Sentra, Titan, Versa Note and Versa Sedan. Also included are the Infiniti Q50, Q60, QX30 and QX80 vehicles.\n\nBackup camera displays, which put the view from the rear-facing camera onto a screen facing the driver, are required to return to default settings each time the car backs up anew. But vehicles affected by the recall retained the settings adjusted by the driver, which could be harmful if the driver had reduced the camera's visibility and did not readjust it to the default view before the next backup.\n\nOwners of affected cars are asked to take them to an authorized dealer for an update of the affected software. Nissan will begin a dealer notification starting October 7, while car owners will be notified starting October 21.\n\nHere are the 2018-2019 Nissan and Infiniti vehicles potentially affected by the recall:", "description": "Owners of the affected vehicles can take them to a dealer for an update on the affected software", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/25/341fa717-b3e6-4999-8ca5-70459358056f/thumbnail/1200x630/b8fa2db8dc992a23a777399ea8607036/gettyimages-1164212968.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
