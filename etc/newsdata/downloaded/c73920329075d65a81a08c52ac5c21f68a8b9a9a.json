Jolie has worked with guns in several movies, including Tomb Raider, Mrs & Mrs Smith and Salt.\n\nGame on: Elle Fanning has become a good friend of Angelina Jolie after co-starring with her in two Maleficent films. And in the November issue of InStyle magazine the 21-year-old actress revealed that they have become so close, they have even gone paintballing\n\nHer celeb pals: Also with Angie were her kids, who are seen here, from left, Knox, Zahara, Pax, Vivienne and Shiloh (Maddox was at college in South Korea) in LA in late September\n\nThe sister of Dakota Fanning added: 'We would do outings because her kids were there, so she was trying to schedule activities on the weekends.'\n\nJolie has six kids: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox.\n\nFanning continued: 'I had never gone paintballing before. We were in full-on armor.\n\n'We were the only people in the place, with all of her kids.\n\n'She and I were not on the same team. I was so bad. I hit their security guard in the neck, and he was on my team! [laughs] Angelina\u2019s really good.'\n\nHer Angie story: Fanning continued: 'I had never gone paintballing before. We were in full-on armor. 'We were the only people in the place, with all of her kids'\n\nWhen the journalist reminds Elle that Jolie played a trained assassin in Salt, the star replied: 'Totally. I was good at hiding. I would just hide.'\n\nBut the two were not always super chummy. For the first Maleficent film, which was released in 2014, Elle was held back in a way.\n\n'With Angelina, I was so young when I did the first film with her. I was very nervous then. My mom was with me,' she confessed.\n\n'Now that I\u2019m grown up, she sees me in a different way. We talked about different things.'\n\nA fan: 'She and I were not on the same team. I was so bad. I hit their security guard in the neck, and he was on my team! [laughs] Angelina\u2019s really good,' she added\n\nJolie also taught her about interviews: 'Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t know all the information. Like, am I qualified to speak on this? But I also think it\u2019s OK for people to say that they don\u2019t know or aren\u2019t sure yet. Angelina said that to me after a recent interview we did for Maleficent 2. She said, \u201cYou know what? It\u2019s OK not to answer things.\u201d I mean, I\u2019m still learning.'\n\nThe former teen movie queen added that she also liked working with Michelle Pfeiffer in the Disney movie.\n\n'When I heard that Michelle was going to be in the film, I realized that the second movie is going to be about power,' said the siren.\n\n'It\u2019s about three generations of women in power and how they represent it in different ways.'\n\nA dynamic trio: The former teen movie queen added that she also liked working with Michelle Pfeiffer in the Disney movie. 'When I heard that Michelle was going to be in the film, I realized that the second movie is going to be about power,' said the siren; see in late September\n\nAnd she still gets starstruck: 'I also love seeing celebrities. I\u2019m not jaded by that at all. I met Beyonc\u00e9 at the Met Ball the first year that I was there [in 2011, when she was 13]. I totally freaked out over that. Leonardo DiCaprio, I totally freaked out over him too.'\n\nThe star also touched on being a tall teen.\n\n'When I watched Friends, I loved Phoebe. I loved that she was gawky.\n\n'I had a real awkward phase. I grew 12 inches in a year. I didn\u2019t want to be like everyone else in school. There was a certain confidence that I had, that I was like, \u201cI want you to make fun of me because that makes me feel cool.\u201d'\n\nAnd she liked going from awkward to Hollywood goddess, as the writer suggested.\n\nHer idol: The star also touched on being a tall teen. 'When I watched Friends, I loved Phoebe. I loved that she was gawky. Here are David Schwimmer as Ross Geller, Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green, Courteney Cox as Monica Geller, Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing, Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay, Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani for season six\n\n'There is, like, a fairy-tale aspect to that, so that was always kind of in me. And I was already doing films and stuff,' said Elle. In 2001 she appeared in her first film, I Am Sam, when she was only two years old.\n\nHer school was Campbell Hall in the [San Fernando] Valley near LA.\n\n'But I was home-schooled until the third grade. And then my mom kind of realized, \u201cOK, you need to be around other kids.\u201d [laughs] I went in fourth grade, and I was there until senior year. I went to all of my proms.\n\n'The first prom was in ninth grade. I wore a white Ralph Lauren dress that we found at the mall. It was long and flowy with a V-neck tank. For the second prom I went to the Paper Bag Princess [in L.A.] and got a vintage bias-cut pink John Galliano dress.'\n\nThe November issue of InStyle is available on newsstands, on Amazon, and for digital download October 18.", "description": "'She and I were not on the same team.
