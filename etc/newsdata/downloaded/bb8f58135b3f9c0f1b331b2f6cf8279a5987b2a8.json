Lawmakers in his party said they had been told to vote for another referendum on Saturday.\n\n(Additional reporting by Guy Faulconbridge and Kate Holton in London; writing by Padraic Halpin; editing by Stephen Addison and John Stonestreet)", "description": "Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said on Thursday it could not support Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit agreement with the European Union, complicating his task of getting it approved by parliament.
