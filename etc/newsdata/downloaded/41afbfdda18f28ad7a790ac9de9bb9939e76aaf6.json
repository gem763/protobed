But executives have recently been tempering that date, and David Marcus \u2014 the head of Calibra, the Facebook subsidiary helping to launch the cryptocurrency \u2014 told reporters last week to think of 2020 as an ambitious goal.\n\n\"We co-wrote a white paper to begin a dialogue with experts and the regulators and policymakers who oversee the stability and security of our financial systems,\" Zuckerberg will say. \"It was never intended to be the final word on the project. The goal was to signal the direction we want to go and to start a conversation about how to get there. That conversation is ongoing.\"\n\nZuckerberg is certain to face a grilling from lawmakers at the hearing, who peppered Marcus with questions and criticisms for hours at a hearing over the summer.\n\nRead more on Zuckerberg\u2019s prepared testimony here.\n\nGET ON BOARD: Forty-seven attorneys general have joined onto the recently announced antitrust investigation into Facebook, the New York attorney general's office announced Tuesday, super-charging a probe that comes amid broader scrutiny of Big Tech by the U.S. government.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James announced that a broad range of states, represented by both Democratic and Republican attorneys general, will participate in probing Facebook's market dominance and business practices over the next several months.\n\nThe investigation has grown significantly since James launched the probe in June with then just seven other attorneys general.\n\n\"After continued bipartisan conversations with attorneys general from around the country, today I am announcing that we have vastly expanded the list of states, districts, and territories investigating Facebook for potential antitrust violations,\" James said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\"Our investigation now has the support of 47 attorneys general from around the nation, who are all concerned that Facebook may have put consumer data at risk, reduced the quality of consumers\u2019 choices, and increased the price of advertising,\" she said. \"As we continue our investigation, we will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook\u2019s actions stifled competition and put users at risk.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\nESPER RECUSED: Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperTrump urges GOP to fight for him Overnight Defense: Trump weighs leaving some troops in Syria to 'secure the oil' | US has pulled 2,000 troops from Afghanistan | Pelosi leads delegation to Afghanistan, Jordan Trump says Israel, Jordan asked US to leave troops in Syria MORE will recuse himself from the Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion \"war cloud\" contract competition due to his son\u2019s employment with one of the companies that sought the deal, the Defense Department announced Tuesday.\n\nEsper, who in late July ordered a review of the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) program over concerns of bias in the competition, has \u201cattended informational briefings to ensure he had a full understanding of the JEDI program and the universe of options available,\u201d chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAlthough not legally required to, he has removed himself from participating in any decision making following the information meetings, due to his adult son's employment with one of the original contract applicants.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that \u201cout of an abundance of caution to avoid any concerns regarding his impartiality,\u201d Esper has delegated decision making for JEDI to Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist.\n\nThe JEDI competition is down to final contenders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to offer cloud-computing to supercharge the Department of Defense's (DOD) war capabilities, including on the battlefield.\n\nAmazon has been largely favored to win the lucrative contract \u2014 which could last for up to 10 years, though it begins at only two \u2014 as it says it is best-equipped to store the necessary top-secret and highly classified information.\n\nWe know you were wondering too: The Pentagon statement does not indicate which company Esper\u2019s son works for.\n\nRead more here.\n\nDEJA VU AGAIN: Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked legislation that would provide funding for states to shore up election security and create more transparency around online advertisements.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Thune John Randolph ThuneTurkey sanctions face possible wall in GOP Senate GOP cautions Graham against hauling Biden before Senate War of words at the White House MORE (R-S.D.) blocked passage of the Honest Ads Act, sponsored by Sen.
