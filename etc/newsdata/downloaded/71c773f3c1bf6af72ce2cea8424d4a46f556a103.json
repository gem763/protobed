The top three countries earned automatic Olympic qualification.\n\nReturning four of five gymnasts from that event, Canada hopes to vault onto the podium \u2014 one year ahead of Tokyo 2020.\n\nThe 2019 world artistic gymnastic championships run through Sunday in Stuttgart, Germany. You can watch all the action live on CBCSports.ca as well as CBC TV.\n\nThe Canadian women's artistic gymnastics qualified a full four-person squad for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics after finishing fifth in the qualifying round in the team event Saturday. Canada's men, conversely, could have a tougher time making the cut.\n\nPodium finishers in all of the men's and women's apparatus finals, plus the the top 12 men and top 20 women in individual all-around event, will also snag Olympic berths.\n\nWATCH | Meet Canada's team:\n\nThe 49th FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Championships will stream live on cbcsports.ca from Tuesday October 8 - Sunday October 13. 0:57\n\nEllie Black, 24, leads the Canadian attack. Halifax's Black, the reigning national all-around champion, became the first Canadian to ever win a world all-around medal when she took silver at 2017 worlds.\n\nAt the Pan Am Games in August, Black took top spot in the all-around event, with one major caveat: American legend Simone Biles did not compete.\n\nBiles already owns the record with 14 gold medals at worlds, but the 22-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, can break the record for most medals. Earning four more in Germany would launch Biles past the retired Vitaly Scherbo for the most ever with 24. More than that, she can write herself into the sport's Code of Points forever.\n\nBiles showed off her triple-twisting double-flip \u2014 the triple-double for short \u2014 when winning the U.S. title in August. If she lands it at worlds, it will go in the Code as \"the Biles.\" The same goes for her double-double beam dismount.\n\nusa is in the house bby \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 <a href=\"https://t.co/aJUo3MjzQf\">pic.twitter.com/aJUo3MjzQf</a> \u2014@Simone_Biles\n\nHowever, Biles enters these world championships under slightly different circumstances. In August, her brother, Tevin Biles-Thomas, was charged with murder in connection to the fatal shooting of three people at a New Year's Eve Party in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nBiles wrote on Twitter she \"aches\" for everyone involved, especially the victims and their families.\n\nJoining Black in facing Biles and the dominant U.S. group for the team event are Brooklyn Moors (Cambridge, Ont.), Ana Padurariu (Whitby, Ont.), Shallon Olsen (Surrey, B.C.) and Victoria Woo (Brossard, Que.).\n\nPadurariu, 17, earned silver in balance beam during 2018 worlds while Olsen, 19, won silver in vault.\n\nThe Canadian men, meanwhile, enter worlds after grabbing bronze in the team event at Pan Ams.\n\nThe gymnasts include: Ren\u00e9 Cournoyer (Repentigny, Que.), William \u00c9mard (Laval, Que.), Cory Paterson (Montreal, Que.), Jackson Payne (Calgary), Sam Zakutney (Ottawa) and Justin Karstadt (Toronto).", "description": "The world artistic gymnastics championships are the last major international meet before the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, and Canada's women's team hopes to vault from fourth place onto the podium.
