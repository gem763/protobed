(See the video above.)\n\nThe challenge involved the two taking turns to share randomly chosen bits from their mobile phones.\n\nSo, when it came time for Kardashian to show husband Kanye West\u2019s latest text to her, she displayed a nice mushy one about the couple\u2019s $14 million purchase of a Wyoming ranch.\n\n\u201cThe first ranch in our family,\u201d the rapper wrote with a photo of the location. \u201c50 years from now this will mean so much to us.\u201d\n\nNow about that. Kardashian told Vogue Arabia recently that she could see herself living in Wyoming full time in 10 years, occasionally flying to Los Angeles.\n\nBut on Wednesday, she said that\u2019s probably not the scenario: \u201cnot full time.\u201d She emphasized in another segment of the show that she would like the property to be for summers and weekends.\n\nGlad that\u2019s cleared that up. But Kim K still has some explaining to do about her \u201cpee hole\u201d Google search.\n\nWatch the fun above.\n\nRelated...\n\nAhem, Kim Kardashian Is Naked Up A Tree\n\nSo Jennifer Lawrence Got Drunk And Naked At Kim Kardashian's Mom's\n\nAshley Graham: 'Kim Kardashian Picked Spinach Out Of My Teeth'\n\nLove HuffPost?
