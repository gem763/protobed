Houses in a neighbourhood in Freeport on Grand Bahama Island were engulfed by six feet of water. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re boats on top of the water,\u201d said Rosa Knowles-Bain, 61, a resident who fled two days ago to an emergency shelter.\n\nDorian was expected to drift to the northwest late on Tuesday and will trawl long the coasts of Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. \u201cLife-threatening\u201d storm surges and hurricane-like winds have been forecast for all three states.\n\nReports said strong and high surf were already being reported along Florida\u2019s east coast as the hurricane was about 168km (105 miles) from West Palm Beach.\n\nAt the White House, staff members reviewed hurricane planning with state and local officials. Mr Trump was being briefed hourly, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said.\n\nNine counties in Florida have issued mandatory evacuations. These included for parts of Duval County, home to Jacksonville, one of Florida\u2019s two biggest cities, and some areas in Palm Beach County, home to Mr Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nRon DeSantis, the Florida governor, urged coastal residents to heed evacuation orders. \u201cGet out now while there\u2019s time and while you have fuel available,\u201d he said from the state\u2019s emergency operations centre in Tallahassee.\n\nAmong those being evacuated was Sue Watson, a 93-year-old resident of a retirement community in Kissimmee in central Florida.\n\n\u201cI was all set to stay home until they had to turn the water off,\u201d said Ms Watson, who added that she was not worried for her personal safety but hoped the storm spared the retirement community.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "At least five people have been killed by Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, the nation\u2019s prime minister has revealed, as Donald Trump spent part of the day playing golf.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/02/18/dorian-five.jpg"}
