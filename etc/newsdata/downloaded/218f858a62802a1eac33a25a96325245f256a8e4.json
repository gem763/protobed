Matt Read also scored for the home side. Michael Hutchinson made five saves in relief.\n\nWATCH | Andersen, Matthews lead Leafs to 3-0 win\n\nAuston Matthews and William Nylander looked to be in mid-season form while Frederik Andersen stopped every shot he faced in a 3-0 Toronto win over Buffalo. 1:17\n\nNylander's contract impasse came to an end minutes before a Dec. 1 deadline when the restricted free agent signed a six-year deal worth nearly US$7 million per season, and he never really got going in 2018-19, finishing with seven goals and 27 points in 54 games.\n\n\"Willie might have had the puck tonight as much as he had last year,\" Leafs head coach Mike Babcock said. \"I'm not kidding. He's got to be feeling good about himself.\"\n\nNylander added a goal and two assists in Toronto's seven-game exit to the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs, but really got going at the world championships, where he led the tournament with 18 points (five goals, 13 points) in eight outings.\n\nNylander, who had six shots on target against the Sabres, is hoping that play translates to the NHL. Friday night was a good start.\n\n\"Our line was skating well,\" Nylander said. \"But it would maybe be nice to hit the net on a few.\"\n\nLinus Ullmark started for the Sabres and stopped 21 shots in 40 minutes of action. Andrew Hammond played the third period and made 10 saves.\n\nThe Leafs dropped their first two games of the exhibition schedule to the Ottawa Senators \u2014 a 3-1 decision in St. John's, N.L., on Tuesday and a 4-3 setback in the nation's capital the following night.\n\nUnlike many Stanley Cup contenders' training camps, there are jobs to be won in Toronto between now and Oct. 2 when the Leafs open the regular season at home against Ottawa. Spots are up for grabs on the fourth line and third defence pair, while the backup goalie position also needs to be filled.\n\nToronto was second-best for most of the game's first 10 minutes, but grabbed a 1-0 lead at 9:48 of the opening period on the power play. Matthews saw his initial shot blocked before Kenny Agostino whipped a quick backhand from the side of the net that went under Ullmark and right to Johnsson.\n\nAndersen, who allowed one goal on 13 shots in his pre-season debut Tuesday, robbed Rasmus Asplund at the other end before Nylander \u2014 who's switched from No. 29 to No. 88 this season \u2014 fired high at the other end.\n\nThe first sporting event held at Scotiabank Arena since Game 5 of the NBA Finals back in June, Friday had a decidedly different feel in a matchup where both teams dressed less than half of their projected regular-season rosters.\n\nBut the goalies did their best to provide some entertainment with a string of nice saves in the second.\n\nUllmark robbed Nylander of a sure goal with his skate before Andersen snapped out the glove to deny Jean-Sebastien Dea.\n\n\"Some big saves there,\" Matthews said of his netminder. \"Hopefully he's not having to make that many come regular-season time.\"\n\nNylander was then stopped on a breakaway, but he deftly set up Matthews for Toronto's second at 12:15.\n\nMatt Read making most of tryout\n\nRead, who's also in Toronto on a PTO, made it 3-0 at 9:40 of the final period on a nice toe drag after rookie defenceman Rasmus Sandin poked the puck off a Sabres' stick in the neutral zone.\n\nCasey Mittelstadt had a chance to break the shutout later in the third after stepping around Sandin, but his shot found iron.\n\nThe Sabres and the Leafs meet again Saturday night in Buffalo.\n\nBabcock said he's starting to get some clarity on which players will stick in Toronto as training camp approaches the midway point.\n\n\"The separation between our guys and the other guys, it grows every day,\" he said. \"The players that are going to end up playing here, they're just going to separate themselves.\"\n\nBlues get past Jets in shootout\n\nDavid Perron scored the late game-tying goal and then the winner 1:58 into overtime as the St. Louis Blues defeated the Winnipeg Jets 4-3 on Friday in exhibition action.\n\nPerron tied the game with 33 seconds remaining in the third after Gabriel Bourque had given the Jets the 3-2 lead at the 16:59 mark of the period.\n\nThe game-winner came after Perron spun around and took a shot that went off the post and past Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck.\n\nKlim Kostin and Joel Edmundson also scored for St. Louis. Kostin added two assists and Sammy Blais had three assists in the team's third straight road game (2-1-0).\n\nEhlers has multi-point game\n\nNikolaj Ehlers had a goal and assist for Winnipeg in his first pre-season game. Adam Lowry also scored.\n\nHellebuyck, also playing his first exhibition game, made 15 saves for the Jets (1-1-1)\n\nJake Allen was in net for two periods for the defending Stanley Cup champions, stopping 18-of-20 shots. Ville Husso replaced him for the third and made 10-of-11 saves.\n\nKostin opened the scoring at 5:32 of the first period.\n\nEdmundson and Kostin then teamed up on a two-on-one for Edmundson's goal at 12:11 to make it 2-0.\n\nEhlers did all the work for his goal.\n\nAfter stripping the puck away from Blues defenceman Mitch Reinke at Winnipeg's blue line, Ehlers used his speed on a breakaway to beat Allen between the pads 38 seconds after Edmundson's goal.\n\nLowry tied it 2-2 at 6:53 of the second period when he tapped in the puck after an Ehlers's shot had hit the crossbar and came out against Allen's pad.\n\nWinnipeg sat veterans such as Blake Wheeler, Mark Scheifele and Josh Morrissey.\n\nSt. Louis didn't play the likes of Vladimir Tarasenko or Brayden Schenn, but Conn Smythe and Selke Trophy winner Ryan O'Reilly skated with Perron and Zach Sanford.", "description": "Auston Matthews and Andreas Johnsson each had a goal and an assist, Frederik Andersen stopped all 24 shots he faced in two periods of work, and the Toronto Maple Leafs downed the Buffalo Sabres 3-0 to pick up their first victory of the NHL pre-season Friday.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5292557.1569028122!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/toronto-maple-leafs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
