The post is full of screenshots comparing Hims's website and Ro's platform, including screenshots of what Hims's site looked like before.\n\nHims did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nRead more: We tried to buy generic Viagra online from Hims and failed \u2014 here's how it went down\n\nRo and Hims are part of a new wave of startups changing the way people access healthcare like prescriptions by offering it online. The model is also controversial because of the way it could cut medications off from the wider healthcare system.\n\nReitano's post takes a mocking tone, even making a reference to a quotation from Marcus Aurelius about imitation being a form of compliment. He also jokes about Aurelius being a Roman emperor, since Ro's men's health brand is called Roman, and laughingly encourages Hims to copy other Ro features, like free two-day shipping.\n\nBut the rivalry between Hims and Ro is serious business.\n\nBoth companies have raised millions from investors in hopes of leading the booming online healthcare market. With such similar services, even an online website's design can set a company apart.\n\nRo's online doctor visits were designed by \"Ro's Clinical Directors, physician network, and world renowned medical advisory board,\" Reitano said in an emailed statement to Business Insider.\n\n\"Over the last two years, we've run thousands of A/B tests and have conducted countless patient interviews to make sure we're always improving and offering the best possible experience for patients,\" he said.\n\nInitialized Capital's Alexis Ohanian, whose firm is an investor in Ro, waded into the conversation on Monday, tweeting at Atomic founder and managing partner Jack Abraham, who co-founded Hims.\n\nLydia Ramsey contributed reporting.", "description": "The design and much of the text are the same, Ro CEO Zachariah Reitano said in a Medium post on Monday.
