Mitt Romney, after announcing his endorsement of Romney during a news conference in Las Vegas. Trump is endorsing Romney in Utah\u2019s Senate race, another sign that the two Republicans are burying the hatchet after a fraught relationship. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File)\n\nIf you get on GOP Twitter right now, you\u2019ll witness a distinct division among most Republicans who simply do not like Mitt Romney and those who consistently act like it\u2019s an affront to human decency if you criticize him.\n\nHere\u2019s what Romney had to say yesterday regarding Trump and Ukraine.\n\nBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 4, 2019\n\nAnd here\u2019s Trump\u2019s response.\n\nMitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous \u201cass\u201d who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him). He is so bad for R\u2019s! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nThe rules are as follows. Romney is always allowed to go after Trump, even before all the facts are in. He can virtue signal his pants off, use words like \u201cappalling,\u201d and make bold proclamations with immunity. But the moment someone goes back at him, it\u2019s automatically responses like this.\n\n.@SenatorRomney is a good man who cares deeply for the country and the constitution. \u2014 Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) October 5, 2019\n\nI\u2019m seriously starting to think a certain segment of Republicans have a bot that runs in the background of their accounts and anytime Romney is criticized, a post calling him a \u201cgood man\u201d is immediately put up.\n\nPeople conflate \u201cnice\u201d with \u201cgood\u201d. \u201cBut Mitt Romney is a good man!\u201d Mitt Romney is nice. \u201cGood\u201d is subject to your own definition. I consider a vulgar brute who stops the Left from trashing my country to be more good than someone who aids the enemy but drinks chocolate milk. \u2014 Jesse Kelly (@JesseKellyDC) October 5, 2019\n\nAnd that\u2019s the divide illustrated. Some are obsessed with decorum and the idea that Romney is above reproach. Others see him as the opportunistic, flip-flopping politician that he is. Let\u2019s not forget that Romney was once unabashedly pro-choice and still supports Roe v. Wade. This is the guy who invented the Obamacare scheme and then opposed it when he ran for President. But he\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d because he generally carries himself in a way that makes Bill Kristol happy.\n\nAt some point, the Republican establishment class are going to have to accept the fact that Mitt Romney is never going to be a thing again. No matter how many times they tell themselves that Romney would have won in 2016 and Trump only won because of Hillary, we aren\u2019t going back. People simply do not like the pompous nature with which he carries himself.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about that. The worst part about Romney, and what has turned so many Republicans against him, is how much of a coward he is when it comes to going after anyone but Donald Trump. That\u2019s the easy thing to do. Bashing Trump gets you back slaps on CNN and praise from Morning Joe. There\u2019s nothing brave about mouthing off about the President. What would be brave is Romney putting out a tweet going after Schiff for lying last week and telling Wolf Blitzer that he\u2019s a sucker for having Schiff do it to his face. But did he do that? Of course he didn\u2019t, just like he never put out a tweet criticizing the Obama administration\u2019s behavior in 2016.\n\nBut if Trump does something, he\u2019s always there to give his two cents. Most Republicans tired of this game a very long time ago. Voters notice when the virtue signaling only goes in one direction and it should surprise no one when they don\u2019t respond well to it, no matter how \u201cgood\u201d someone is.\n\nRobby Starbuck put a thread out expressing a common sentiment.\n\nMitt Romney is bitter and angry. He could stomach losing to a candidate who made words sound pretty in Obama but he can\u2019t stand that a man who speaks like normal people do got the job done that he couldn\u2019t. Passive aggressive hate has driven his Jeff Flake persona since 2016. \u2014 Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) October 5, 2019\n\nNo one wants to stick their neck out for someone who\u2019s content being a loser. That\u2019s who Mitt always was so I kept my mouth shut about politics even as I reluctantly voted for him. He cares about his elite friends approval, his $ & doesn\u2019t appear he cares about much else, period. \u2014 Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) October 5, 2019\n\nThe DC elite are under the impression that if they get rid of Trump everyone will listen to them again. They don\u2019t realize yet that it\u2019s all over. They don\u2019t realize that who they are has become transparent to enough of the country that it changes the game forever. \u2014 Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) October 5, 2019\n\nAnyone that thinks Romney is sincere in his one-sided, select criticism of Trump is kidding themselves. This, like everything throughout Romney\u2019s career, is simply about politics and power. He believes he can ride this storm out and keep his hands clean, somehow regaining prominence after 2020. It\u2019s not going to happen and voters will make sure of it.\n\nI\u2019ll end by pointing out the hypocrisy here as well. The same people defending Romney for attacking Trump have repeatedly cited Reagan\u2019s \u201c11th commandment\u201d to assert that Trump shouldn\u2019t criticize other Republicans. Why doesn\u2019t Romney have to abide by that one? I think we know the answer.\n\nWhile some are clutching their pearls, I\u2019ve not no problem with Trump hitting back at Romney. The Utah Senator is welcome to not tweet if he doesn\u2019t want to be responded to.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
