Though the suspension is the normal way to end one session of the British parliament and begin a new one, opposition lawmakers reacted with fury at the timing of the move as it took away weeks of precious parliamentary time just as the U.K. hurtles towards its scheduled exit date from the EU at the end of October.\n\nScottish judges have now declared the decision unlawful after lawyers representing 75 British lawmakers from each of parliament's major parties argued that it was designed to prevent parliament from debating and taking action on Brexit. Johnson claimed he wanted to suspend parliament to allow him to introduce fresh legislation in a new parliamentary term.\n\nAsked by The Daily Beast what they expected to happen next, a British government minister responded only: \u201cBad things.\u201d\n\nThe shock decision is not expected to immediately reverse Johnson's suspension of parliament as no order to do so was given by the judges in their Wednesday ruling. The British government will be forced to appeal the decision in a showdown at the U.K. supreme court next week.\n\nThe three Scottish judges said in a brief draft statement Wednesday morning that they unanimously believe prorogation was motivated by stopping Parliament holding the government to account. The judges added: \u201cThe Prime Minister's advice to HM the Queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect.\u201d\n\nThe judges also ruled that Johnson's advice to the Queen\u2014who was asked to prorogue parliament by ministers from his government\u2014was illegal. They said that they believe \u201cthe PM\u2019s advice to the HM the Queen is justiciable, that it was motivated by the improper purpose of stymying Parliament and that it, and what has followed from it, is unlawful.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the prime minister's office said they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the decision and confirmed an appeal, adding: \u201cThe U.K. government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda. Proroguing Parliament is the legal and necessary way of delivering this.\u201d\n\nOpposition lawmakers urged the immediate recalling of parliament. Scottish National Party lawmaker Joanna Cherry, who led the challenge, warned the prime minister: \u201cYou cannot break the law with impunity, Boris Johnson. The rule of law will be upheld by Scotland\u2019s courts and I hope also the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.\u201d", "description": "A Scottish court has delivered a sensational verdict after lawyers argued Boris was trying to prevent parliament from taking action on Brexit.", "authors": ["Jamie Ross"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1771,w_3150,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568193463/RTS2PZYA_npulk1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
