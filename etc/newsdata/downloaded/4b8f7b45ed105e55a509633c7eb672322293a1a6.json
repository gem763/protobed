She was ultimately among more than 30 underage girls identified as victims of Epstein during a wide-ranging investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Miami.\n\nIn 2008, under the pseudonym \u201cJane Doe 1,\u201d Wild sued the Justice Department in an effort to vindicate her rights as a crime victim. She alleged that the Epstein agreement was illegal because prosecutors failed to confer with her and the dozens of other alleged victims in advance of striking the deal, as required under the federal Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act.\n\n\u201cI have been re-victimized, at every stage, by the same government that\u2019s supposed to protect me,\u201d Wild, 31, wrote in the letter to Barr.\n\nEpstein served just 13 months in a private wing of a Palm Beach County Jail and was granted liberal work releases privileges that allowed him to spend up to 16 hours a day at his office.\n\nEven after Epstein served his sentence and moved his primary residence to a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Wild continued to press her case against the federal government over Epstein\u2019s indulgent deal.\n\nAfter 11 years of highly-contested litigation, which exposed the details of secret negotiations between prosecutors and Epstein\u2019s high-powered defense team, a federal judge ruled in February that the deal with Epstein was reached in violation of the rights of Wild and the other alleged victims.\n\nBut before the court could take the next step to decide whether to toss out the agreement, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, on July 6, arrested Epstein for an alleged sex trafficking conspiracy. The new charges led to fresh scrutiny of Epstein\u2019s prior lenient treatment and to the resignation of the U.S. Secretary of Labor, R. Alexander Acosta, who presided over the non-prosecution agreement as the top federal prosecutor in Miami.\n\nRichard Drew/AP, FILE\n\nIt also gave hope to Wild that justice might finally be near for her and other girls and young women allegedly abused by Epstein. She traveled to New York for Epstein\u2019s detention hearing and urged a judge to keep Epstein locked up until his trial.\n\nLess than a month later, Epstein was dead from an apparent suicide in his federal prison cell.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, when Jeffrey Epstein died, the judge threw my case out,\u201d Wild wrote in her letter to Barr. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense to me because the co-conspirators who received immunity through the illegal deal are still alive, as is the government who I sued for violating my rights in the first place. How is it fair that the government and Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators essentially get immunity by way of the government allowing Epstein to die in its custody?\u201d\n\nWild is now appealing the court order that closed her case and is urging Barr to step in to review the department\u2019s position opposing invalidation of the deal.\n\n\u201cShe is not about to quit because of one bad ruling,\u201d said Wild\u2019s attorney, Brad Edwards. \u201cThe dismissal of Courtney\u2019s case was shocking to her. And who can argue with her logic? The government should not escape from one mistake by committing another.\u201d\n\nFollowing Epstein\u2019s death, Barr publicly vowed to continue pursuing the investigation into others who may have assisted Epstein.\n\n\u201cAny co-conspirators should not rest easy,\u201d Barr said in an August speech. \u201cThe victims deserve justice, and they will get it.\u201d\n\nYet Edwards argues that the ongoing investigation in New York shouldn\u2019t mean \u201cthat those who assisted in the abuse of Courtney and many others in Florida should benefit from an illegal deal,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAll she wants is for the government to work with her and not continue to fight against her.\u201d\n\nWild\u2019s letter notes that Epstein\u2019s well-connected attorneys were able to plead their case all the way up to senior Justice Department officials in 2008, and she asks that Barr, the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official, afford her and other alleged Epstein victims the same opportunity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why the man that abused me gets to have his issues reviewed by the top people in the Justice Department,\u201d Wild writes. \u201cBut the victims do not have that same right?\u201d", "description": "Courtney Wild, who has accused sex offender Jeffrey Epstein of childhood abuse, is not giving up her fight for justice, even after Epstein\u2019s death by apparent suicide in", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/courtney-wild-01-as-ap-190810_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
