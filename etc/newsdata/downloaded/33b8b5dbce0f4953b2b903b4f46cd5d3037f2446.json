The announcement came minutes ago, and has boosted sentiment around Europe. Whether the deal will get approval in Westminster is a different story, but for now, the mood is optimistic. The DUP haven\u2019t\u2019 changed their position, which could prove to be an issue, so they bullish sentiment might be short-lived.\n\nIt was reported that China and the US are discussing the next phase of trade talks.

The building materials supplier cited softer demand in the UK in addition to a delays in construction permits in the Netherlands. Uncertainty in relation to Brexit is hanging over the entire UK economy, and in particular, the construction industry. The lack of political clarity in the UK has caused a slowdown in activity in the construction sector as firms can\u2019t plan for the long-term. Home owners are also curtailing their expenditure in relation to DIY improvements, which is also impacting Grafton Group.\n\n(LON: ) shares are lower as the company\u2019s money division underperformed. Total revenue in the third-quarter increased by 4%. The money unit saw revenue fall by 5% on account of \u2018continuing challenges in product availability\u2019. The home services division saw a 21% jump in revenue in the period, while the insurance operation saw a small rise in revenue. Weakness in the Money division isn\u2019t ideal, but the business is still in good shape. Should the consumer climate continue to be fragile, more people might start to use the money-saving website as a way of trimming their outgoings.\n\n(LON: ) continues to see respectable trading in its core market, but tit has taken the decision to exits it international markets. Quarterly UK system sales increased by 3.9%, but \u2018international system sales continue to be disappointing\u2019.

International subscriber growth was 6.26 million, and the consensus estimate 6.05 million. The US subscriber level was 517,000, while dealers were anticipating more than 800,000.
