If you add in districts that Hillary Clinton narrowly won that previously Republicans have won, now you\u2019re looking at over 60 districts. And those are represented by Democrats in Congress who did not get elected by saying they were going to be part of the socialist \u2018Squad,\u2019 or the next AOC, or an obstructionist. They got elected exactly the opposite. They said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to be like them. I\u2019m going to be a pragmatist. I\u2019m going to work with Donald Trump when possible.\u2019 And you know what? Not only have they not done it, but by then coming out in favor of this impeachment inquiry, they have shown their true political partisan stripes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in their districts,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve got awesome volunteers. I was just looking at some of the videos that are coming, and I saw them on Twitter of folks like you and me, who are going out, everyday citizens, going to their members of Congress\u2019 offices and saying, \u2018This is not what we sent you to Washington to work on. Stop playing politics and start working on policy.\u2019 And I hope their members of Congress are hearing them. But if not, they certainly will hear them loud and clear at the ballot box next November.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "Tuesday during a radio appearance, Republican National Committee deputy communications director Cassie Smedile acknowledged her organization was targeting Democrats not just in districts President Donald Trump won in 2016 but also ones he narrowly lost to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as well. | Clips", "authors": ["Jeff Poor"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/12/AP_16314607021622.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
