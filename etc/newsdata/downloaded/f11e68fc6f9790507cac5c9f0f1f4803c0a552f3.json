The article\u2019s headline emphasizes that Donald Trump had decided to \u201ctake a hatchet to Adam Schiff,\u201d and talks about Trump\u2019s strategy to make the House Intel chair the issue. However, Schiff\u2019s admission that he\u2019d taken a hatchet to the truth first only emerges in the eighth paragraph, despite being an apparent exclusive for TDB:\n\nSchiff had previously denied that his staff had contact with the whistleblower before the complaint was flagged for them by the Intelligence Community\u2019s Inspector General. On Wednesday, he said that he did not know definitively at the time if the complaint had been authored by the same whistleblower who had approached his staff. But he acknowledged that he \u201cshould have been much more clear.\u201d \u201cWe try not to confirm when people have come in. I was really thinking along the lines of wanting to get him to come in to testify,\u201d Schiff told The Daily Beast. \u201cI regret that I wasn\u2019t much more clear.\u201d Such nuance is unlikely to win converts inside the White House where anger among senior staff seems to be firmly directed at the congressman and driven by a belief that his inaccuracies are covered more sympathetically than the president\u2019s. One senior aide even proclaimed that Trump was \u201cfar more focused\u201d on Schiff than he was on the identity of the whistleblower himself.\n\nSuch nuance is actually not all that nuanced at all. The New York Times article reports clearly enough that it wasn\u2019t a question of timing for the appearance. The whistleblower worked with the committee to formalize the complaint, and Schiff had knowledge of it long before he acknowledged such:\n\nThe Democratic head of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, learned about the outlines of a C.I.A. officer\u2019s concerns that President Trump had abused his power days before the officer filed a whistle-blower complaint, according to a spokesman and current and former American officials\u2026 The C.I.A. officer approached a House Intelligence Committee aide with his concerns about Mr. Trump only after he had had a colleague first convey them to the C.I.A.\u2019s top lawyer. Concerned about how that initial avenue for airing his allegations through the C.I.A. was unfolding, the officer then approached the House aide. In both cases, the original accusation was vague. The House staff member, following the committee\u2019s procedures, suggested the officer find a lawyer to advise him and file a whistle-blower complaint. The aide shared some of what the officer conveyed to Mr. Schiff. The aide did not share the whistle-blower\u2019s identity with Mr. Schiff, an official said.\n\nTherefore, not only did Schiff know that a whistleblower had approached his staff, but that it was the same complaint and therefore the whistleblower.\n\nAnother point ignored in the Daily Beast \u201chatchet\u201d story is the previous two years of context for hatchet work. This isn\u2019t the first time Schiff has lied in public about what he knows and when he did/didn\u2019t know it. Before the release of the Mueller report in April of this year, Schiff repeatedly insisted that \u201csignificant evidence\u201d existed of Trump\u2019s collusion with Russia and that Mueller had already uncovered it. Was all of that \u201cnuance\u201d as well, or does Schiff regret not making himself \u201cmore clear\u201d now that Mueller\u2019s report made it all too clear that Schiff was lying about that, too?\n\nIt\u2019s legit news that the Trump strategy for fighting impeachment will focus on Schiff\u2019s credibility, of course, even if that\u2019s so obvious a strategy that it\u2019s barely worth highlighting. What seems less legitimate is the use of \u201chatchet\u201d as a descriptor for Trump\u2019s attacks without even a single mention of Schiff\u2019s prior discredited claims on collusion, as well as this softball mention of Schiff\u2019s attempt to soft-pedal repeated public falsehoods about the nature of the relationship between his committee staff and the whistleblower. One might even call it a hatchet job.\n\nUpdate: Here\u2019s Nancy Pelosi trying to give Schiff a little cover, but George Stephanopoulos isn\u2019t having it:\n\nHere @SpeakerPelosi lies and says that @AdamSchiff didn\u2019t fabricate Trump\u2019s words when opening the committee hearing with Maguire.

House Intelligence Committee rules state that any classified material brought to a committee member has to be shared with both sides immediately. Did Schiff do that? If not, why not?", "description": "Hatchet jobs.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/schiff-stare.jpeg"}
