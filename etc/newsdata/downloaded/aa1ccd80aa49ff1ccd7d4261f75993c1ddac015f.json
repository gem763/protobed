In French, however, he'll do it twice.\n\nThat's because a lot of the voters who will be tuning in to that second French-language debate are among the most coveted voters in the country \u2014 francophone Quebecers living in ridings that could swing in any of two or even three directions.\n\nOn Friday, the Liberals said Trudeau would attend the debate being organized by TVA, the only major television network in the country not participating in the two debates \u2014 one in each official language \u2014 organized by the Leaders' Debate Commission, a body established by the government after the last election and chaired by former governor general David Johnston.\n\nBut Trudeau will not be participating in either of the two other proposed English-language debates \u2014 by Maclean's/Citytv and the Munk Debates. In 2015, the three major parties leaders participated in two debates in each official language and a fifth that was bilingual.\n\nWhile an extra French debate provides another opportunity for Trudeau to call one of his opponents \"mon amour,\" the decision also highlights how Quebec is central to the Liberals' re-election plans. But Trudeau isn't the only federal leader with Quebec on the mind.\n\nLast week, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer held a rally in Laval and gave a speech to the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal. On the weekend, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh pledged he would increase Quebec's immigration funding if elected. And Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, thinks of nothing else but the Quebec vote.\n\nThe Liberals, Conservatives and Bloc are circling the staggering NDP, hoping to gobble up the 16 seats the New Democrats won in the province in the last election. Outremont, where Tom Mulcair made history for the party when he won it in 2007, already fell to the Liberals in a byelection in February.\n\nWhere each party is best-positioned to make these gains differs \u2014 the Liberals on the island of Montreal, the Bloc in the surrounding suburbs and the Conservatives in the central part of the province. But where these areas intersect, there could be heated battles between two of the three parties and, in some case, all three.\n\nThat just happens to be where a lot of TVA's audience lives.\n\nParties need TVA audience\n\nTVA is run by Quebecor, which also manages the Journal de Montr\u00e9al and the Journal de Qu\u00e9bec, and is headed by Pierre-Karl P\u00e9ladeau \u2014 who was briefly leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and who attended a Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois campaign-launch event last month.\n\nThe network is the most-watched in Quebec and its audience trends more on the nationalist side of the political spectrum in the province, with big numbers among middle-aged French-speaking Quebecers and those living in the suburbs around Montreal.\n\nThis is a key demographic for the Liberals \u2014 as well as the Conservatives and the Bloc. It's an audience that the prime minister can't afford to shun.\n\nThe CBC's Canada Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polling data, gives the Liberals a wide lead in Quebec with 35 per cent support, against 22 per cent for the Conservatives and 19 per cent for the Bloc.\n\nThe New Democrats, who captured just over 25 per cent of the vote in Quebec in 2015, are in a race for fourth with the Greens at 10 per cent apiece.\n\nThree-way race outside of Montreal, Quebec City\n\nBut the Liberals' advantage on the island of Montreal and among anglophones inflates the party's numbers in Quebec. Outside of Montreal, the race is far more competitive.\n\nPolling results provided to CBC News by Abacus Data from its latest survey suggest the Liberals are ahead of the Conservatives by about 20 points in Greater Montreal, but trail by a wider margin in the Quebec City region. Outside of the two big cities, the Liberals stand at just 29 per cent against 22 per cent for the Bloc and 17 per cent apiece for the Conservatives and NDP.\n\nL\u00e9ger shows a tighter race in the \"regions,\" at 29 per cent for the Liberals, 26 per cent for the Conservatives and 22 per cent for the Bloc. Considering the larger margin for error of sub-regional samples in both polls, that is toss-up territory \u2014 a sharp contrast to the Liberals' lead in Montreal and the Conservative strength in Quebec City.\n\nIt puts a lot of ridings up for grabs, beyond just those that the New Democrats will be defending.\n\nLiberals, Bloc contesting dozens of seats\n\nThe Poll Tracker's seat projection model suggests that there are a few legitimate three-way races between the Liberals, Conservatives and Bloc \u2014 seats like Drummond and Saint-Hyacinthe\u2013Bagot in central Quebec.\n\nThere are a few Liberal-Conservative contests as well, like Qu\u00e9bec and Louis-H\u00e9bert in Quebec City.\n\nThe biggest chunk of contested ridings, however, appear to be between the Liberals and the Bloc. The Liberals currently have the upper hand in these seats, but the model points to 24 ridings in which the two parties are considered to be in contention. The majority of them are in the suburbs around Montreal, with eight of them in the Laurentides region north of the city and another seven in the Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie to the south and east.\n\nBloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet is running in the riding of Beloeil\u2013Chambly, one of 16 seats in Quebec the NDP won in 2015. (Justin Tang / Canadian Press)\n\nWith the numbers we can see at this stage of the race \u2014 and things will undoubtedly change \u2014 the Conservatives are playing on a smaller field. The Conservatives are seriously in the running in about 13 to 19 seats, whereas the range is nine to 22 seats for the Bloc and 39 to 55 for the Liberals.\n\nHigh-risk, high-reward debate\n\nAll else being equal, a good performance by Trudeau in the TVA debate will help his party get closer to the top end of that range \u2014 a number the Liberals will need to approach if they want to secure another majority government.\n\nBut the risk is that if he has a bad performance, both the Bloc and Conservatives could be well-positioned to benefit, increasing the odds for the Conservatives to form government and the Bloc to re-acquire recognized party status in the House of Commons.\n\nFor Trudeau, attending the TVA debate is a high-risk, high-reward proposition. Scheduled for Oct. 2, it will take place before the French-language commission debate on Oct. 10, which might mitigate some of that risk since he will have one more opportunity to speak to francophone Quebecers.\n\nBut not attending would have been all risk, no reward. With the election shaping up to be close, that might not have been a gamble the prime minister could afford to take.", "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has committed to participate in only one English TV debate but two in French.
