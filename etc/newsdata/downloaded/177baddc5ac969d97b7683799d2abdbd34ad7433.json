The Queensland government is also adding hydrogen cars to its fleet.\n\nKeolis claims it will operate more fully electric transport networks in France by the end of the year than any other company as it picks up more contracts, including managing 43 fully electric buses in the northern French city of Amiens.\n\nIn Australia, where Keolis operates in a joint venture with Downer EDI, the group plans to bid for the proposed third stage of the Gold Coast light rail line G:link if the Queensland government secures enough funding to go ahead with the project.\n\nKeolis Downer already operates the first two stages of G:link as well as Melbourne's Yarra trams and buses in South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland.\n\nAustralia remains an attractive market, Mr Tabary said. \"You can sense that this country is booming with population growth and an urbanisation agenda.\"\n\nThe integrated public transport model adopted by Newcastle, where Keolis Downer manages the city's buses, ferry and light rail systems and its trialling on-demand services, is likely to be adopted by other medium-sized cities if the Newcastle project proves to be a long-term success, he said.\n\nAdelaide has put out a tender calling for a single group to operate both its buses and trams as it privatises more of its transport networks.", "description": "French transport operator Keolis says hydrogen-fuelled cars, buses and trains are on their way as governments slash greenhouse gases.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9099%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/38dd200566795960b222c7b7d060e965a55acaec", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
