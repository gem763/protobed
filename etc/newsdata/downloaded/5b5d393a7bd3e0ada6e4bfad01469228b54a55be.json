(Reuters/Steve Marcus)\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Tyson Fury\u2019s title was dripping away, along with a lot of his blood, as he was cut late in the third round by a punch from Otto Wallin that opened a deep gash above his right eyebrow.\n\nReferee Tony Weeks had the doctor check it and there was a palpable sense at T-Mobile Arena on Saturday that the Swede could be on the verge of a massive upset.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut Fury picked up the pace considerably and showed the heart of a champion, pulling away to capture a tougher-than-expected unanimous decision victory over the 25-1 underdog.\n\nJudges had it 116-112, 117-111 and 118-110 for Fury. Yahoo Sports had it 116-112 for Fury.\n\nAfter it was over, Fury bellowed, \u201cDeontay Wilder! I want you next, bum!\u201d referring to the WBC heavyweight champion he\u2019s scheduled to fight on Feb. 22.\n\n\u201cDeontay Wilder, I want you next, bum!\u201d @Tyson_Fury calls out @BronzeBomber after his victory \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/Kznky4WHEI \u2014 Top Rank Boxing (@trboxing) September 15, 2019\n\nBut for a while, that bout was very much in doubt as Wallin gave Fury fits early in the bout. Not only did Wallin open the cut with a clean punch, but then he did everything possible within the rules and sometimes outside them, to deepen it.\n\nAt one point, after Wallin raked his glove across Fury\u2019s face, Fury shouted obscenities at Wallin.\n\nBut Fury proved what he\u2019s made of. He clearly picked up the intensity and was landing thudding shots to the ribcage. He nearly finished Walli\n\nStory continues\n\nn at the end of the 11th with a shot to the solar plexus that doubled the Swede over. Wallin was saved by the bell in the 11th.\n\nHe fought a strong 12th, but Fury had put enough rounds in the bank by that point to have the victory wrapped up.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Tyson Fury\u2019s title was dripping away, along with a lot of his blood, as he was cut late in the third round by a punch from Otto Wallin that opened a deep gash above his right eyebrow.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zl4TVu3dz4FlTW1n975n2A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MzAuOTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/M9LsHllEYk48ZdZXDk4aqQ--~B/aD0yNTY1O3c9Mzk1MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/130a14f0-d789-11e9-afb9-0232d4f33305", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
