Earlier this week he told Reuters Ukraine did want not to be dragged into U.S. domestic politics.\n\nDanylyuk is a former finance minister who oversaw the nationalisation of PrivatBank, Ukraine's largest lender, and his appointment to his security role in May sent a positive signal to investors gauging Zelenskiy's reformist credentials.\n\nInvestors are also looking for Kiev to conclude a new loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund to help underpin economic stability, tackle reforms and fight corruption. An IMF delegation left Ukraine on Friday without finalising an agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Matthias Williams and Ilya Zhegulev and Pavel Polityuk, Editing by Andrew Heavens and Timothy Heritage)", "description": "A senior Ukrainian security official offered to quit before President Volodymyr Zelenskiy began a visit to the United States this week, the president's office said on Friday.
