Because they work hard...and play hard too!'\n\nSnapped from behind, mid-trick, the image was posted to the Sussexes Instagram yesterday, with the caption: 'Some more fun moments from the announcement of the UK Invictus team 2020.\n\n'Because they work hard...and play hard too!'\n\nIt comes after one competitor, Lynsey Kelly, 35, was left red-faced when she put her arm around the royal's waist for a selfie and exclaimed: 'Oh no, my hand's just stuck on Prince Harry's bottom!'\n\nHarry, who was on great form as he greeted each and every one of the 65-strong team who will compete on behalf of the UK at The Hague next year, took the moment in his stride and laughed uproariously.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, 35, attended the event at the Honourable Artillery Company along with 65 sportsmen and women who have been selected for the Paralympics-style competition in the Netherlands next year\n\nHarry, pictured, launched the Invictus Games after attending the Warrior Games in Colorado six years ago\n\nMs Kelly, 35, from Oxfordshire, spoke afterwards about the affect being part of the Invictus Team had already had on her \u2013 and, of course, accidentally touching the sixth in line to the throne's derriere.\n\nShe said: 'I have been really quite poorly with my mental and physical health but this experience, clich\u00e9d as it sounds, has already actually changed my life.'\n\nMs Kelly, a logistical movements controller, was medically discharged from the RAF as a result of leg and foot injuries. She became severely depressed and put on ten stone in weight in just 18 months.\n\nShe has already lost half of that and hopes to lose more as she competes in swimming, archery, power lifting and rowing.\n\nMs Kelly said: 'It has made me realise that I am still worthy and I am deserving. My motto has become: if I can do this, anyone can do this.\n\nOne competitor, Lynsey Kelly, 35, was left red-faced after she put her arm around the Duke of Sussex's waist for a selfie and exclaimed: 'Oh no, my hand's just stuck on Prince Harry's bottom!'\n\nHarry took the moment in his stride and laughed uproariously during the Team UK launch\n\n'The pain had become so bad that sometimes I couldn't get out of bed, lift my head off the pillow or wash my hair. I also didn't want to leave the RAF, I was medically discharged, and I think that all took a massive toll on my mental health.'\n\nShe described Harry's involvement as 'wonderful', saying: 'That someone of his standing is doing this to raise awareness, it just wonderful. '\n\nAsked about her selfie, she exclaimed: 'Oh my gosh! I just put my arm around him and it all went a bit wrong. I said: 'Oh I am so sorry, my arm has just [got] stuck on your bottom'. He just laughed, thankfully. He is so friendly. He is so normal, ex-serving military, he knows what we are on about and can relate to what we are talking about.\n\n'He is amazing. He has had struggles with his own mental health at times and can relate to us. So it's just wonderful. He is a great ambassador for this.'\n\nTeam UK unveiled its first female captain, RAF veteran Rachel Williamson, who is pictured to Harry's left\n\nHarry hugs a woman at the Invictus Games Team UK launch at the Honourable Artillery Company in London\n\nDuring an informal chat with the competitors the royal - who spent ten years as an Army officer - said it was 'going to be awesome', adding: 'This is an opportunity for you guys to be serving your country again.'\n\nThe event saw the team of wounded, injured and sick service personnel, both serving and veterans, coming together for the first time ahead of next year's competition.\n\nIt was designed by Prince Harry to highlight the importance of sport as part of the recovery journey of those with life changing injuries or illnesses.\n\nThe UK is one of 19 nations who will be taking part in the fifth Invictus Games next May in The Netherlands, which will see 500 competitors competing in 10 adaptive sports. The Team UK trials were held in Sheffield in July this year.\n\nHarry, dressed casually in beige trousers, boots and a matching jumper with a Remembrance poppy pinned to it, arrived 25 minutes late but received a rousing welcome. 'What are you most looking forward to? ' he asked the team.\n\n'Who is still serving? Who's RAF?' he asked, before comically gesturing to one side and shouting: 'Out!' His audience laughed loudly at the comic banter highlighting the traditional rivalry between the Army and Air Force.", "description": "The Duke of Sussex, 35, attended the event at the\u00a0Honourable Artillery Company along with\u00a065 sportsmen and women who have been selected for the Paralympics -style competition.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/20369220-0-image-a-26_1572434627692.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
