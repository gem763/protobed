(PHOTO: Sthembiso Lebuso)\n\nBroken, cream-coloured tiles form a mosaic of a woman's face in the entrance hall of a Cape Town shelter for abused women. Branches extending from her head are painted across the wall, decorated with colourful leaves.\n\n\"The face represents the broken women who arrive\" here, says the director of the Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children, Bernadine Bachar. \"The branches show the healing, growth and final empowerment they experience through the programmes we offer.\"\n\nThe centre near Athlone, Cape Town, is a 24-hour safehouse for women and children who have been victims of abuse. The shelter can take up to 120 women at a time with their children \u2013 and they are usually at full capacity.\n\nProtests against femicide have rocked South Africa over the past few weeks after a series of murders that shocked the public. Among them was Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana, who was raped and killed in a post office.\n\nMinister of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, said that more than 30 women were killed by their spouses last month.\n\n#AmINext\n\nThe hashtag #AmINext has been trending, with protesters demanding immediate action from the government. Some of them have called for the return of the death penalty and for a state of emergency to be declared.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa announced an emergency plan to stop the resurgence in violence against women on Wednesday. During an emergency sitting in the National Assembly, he said South Africa was one of \"the most unsafe places in the world to be a woman\".\n\nThe Western Cape Women's Shelter Movement (WCWSM) protested outside Parliament during the talks, demanding it consider the significant role played by safehouses for women and children.\n\nBachar says urgent action is needed.\n\nSaartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children (Image via www.nari.co.za)\n\n\"We've absolutely seen an increase in gender-based violence over the past three months,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\"Not only has the number of women (affected) increased, but they're suffering from more intensive injuries than they used to before.\"\n\nAccording to Bachar, they are seeing a lot more burn victims, particularly from boiling water thrown at the face, and an increase in stab victims.\n\nShe blames this on a lack of government intervention, high levels of substance abuse and an unprecedented increase in unemployment rates that result in \"a lack of power and control which drives gender-based violence\".\n\n'Dripping with blood'\n\nBachar also accuses the police of not taking the victims seriously and says they need to undergo special training to equip them with the necessary skills to deal with cases of sexist violence.\n\nOne abuse survivor, Rachel Petersen, recounted a bitter experience with authorities.\n\n\"I went to the police, and I was dripping with blood, but they still wouldn't help me. They said they don't get involved in 'house issues',\" Petersen says.\n\nThe 44-year-old, who currently lives and works at the centre for abused women, blames a lack of education and awareness for the problem.\n\n\"I was always taught by my grandmother that as a wife it is my job to be submissive. Before I came to this centre, I didn't even know what abuse meant,\" she said.\n\nThe centre receives funding from the Department of Social Development \u2013 but Bachar says that only covers 40% of the annual cost of running the shelter.\n\nShe says it needs a further R6m, but raising that amount is \"impossible\".\n\n\"Increased funding would mean we could uniformly extend our services to more survivors.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children in Cape Town can take up to 120 women at a time with their children \u2013 and they are usually at full capacity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9360/3c6e84cf79134490abeb23aca580ac1d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
