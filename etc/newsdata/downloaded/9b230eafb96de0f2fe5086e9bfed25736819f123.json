Below the photograph of a book on a desk, he read the caption \u201cThis is the unfinished manuscript of the greatest scientist of our time\u201d \u2014 Albert Einstein, who died without realizing his dream of unifying all the known physical forces into one theory. Kaku decided then and there to dedicate his life to finishing it. The theoretical physicist and futurist, who teaches at the City University of New York Graduate Center, and collaborates with scientists outside Geneva at CERN, home to the Large Hadron Collider, believes that more than six decades later, physicists are almost there.\n\n[LINK TO MAIN STORY] In Barcelona to speak at the third annual Ufology World Congress, [LINK ENDS] Kaku, whose most recent book is \u201cThe Future of Humanity: Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel, Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth,\u201d spoke with Yahoo News on topics from the state of human evolution to the upcoming traffic jam around the moon.\n\nThe interview has been lightly edited for space and clarity:\n\nYahoo News: Fifty years ago, UFOs were front-page news, but now there\u2019s a stigma when people talk about them seriously, particularly scientists. What\u2019s behind that?\n\nMichio Kaku: Traditionally, there\u2019s been the giggle factor. Every time you talk to a physicist or a scientist about UFOs, their eyes kind of roll and they start to giggle. Science is based on things that are testable, reproducible and falsifiable.\n\nSo when scientists hear stories about UFOs, they\u2019re thinking\u2026\n\nWhere\u2019s the beef? Where\u2019s the evidence?\n\nYou mention that the game is changing. What\u2019s causing that?\n\nFirst, we have military pilots who have given us testable evidence, evidence we can now look at to calculate the parameters. Before, it was \u201csomething sailed over the sky!\u201d What does that mean? We now know they travel between Mach 5 and Mach 20, we now know they zigzag such that the centrifugal force would crush any living tissue \u2014 so they must be cybernetic or robotic.\n\nSo there are two possibilities. \u2026 They could be hypersonic drones [which are being developed by Russia, the U.S. and China]. The other possibility that now has to be put on the table is that they\u2019re extraterrestrial \u2014 which used to be the subject of the giggle factor. But now we\u2019ve located 4,000 exoplanets around other stars in the galaxy.\n\nFor the first time in history, we have a census of the galaxy. We now know on average every star has a planet going around it \u2014 and about one in five has an Earth-like planet. That means there are billions of Earth-like planets orbiting other stars in our backyard, not even other galaxies.\n\nThat makes the chances seem somewhat higher that life could be out there somewhere. In the case that we do encounter aliens, should we assume they\u2019re more advanced than we are?\n\nI\u2019m a physicist. We rank civilizations by energy. So one day when we intercept messages from alien civilizations, we\u2019ll ask, What level are they?\n\nA Type 1 civilization is planetary. They control the weather. They can modify volcanoes and earthquakes. Anything planetary, they control.\n\nA Type 2 civilization is stellar. They control the star; they control the energy output of the entire star. They colonize nearby solar systems. They are immortal. Nothing known to science can destroy a Type 2 civilization. Meteors and comets can be deflected. If their star becomes unstable, they just leave and move to another star.\n\nA Type 3 civilization, which is galactic, they can roam the galaxy.\n\nNow, if we are visited by aliens from outer space, they\u2019re possibly Type 2, more than likely Type 3, meaning they are thousands of years ahead of us in technology. Scientists giggle because a starship going between stars isn\u2019t imaginable with our technology. What\u2019s the mistake? The mistake is to assume extraterrestrials are only 100 years more advanced than us.\n\nWhere does our civilization fit on that scale?\n\nIf we grow at 3 percent per year in energy consumption \u2026 we will be a Type 1 civilization in 100 years, around 2100.\n\nWhat is the internet? The first planetary technology to be developed. By 2100, we\u2019ll have many planetary technologies. We\u2019re seeing the beginning of a planetary language. English and Mandarin Chinese are the two most popular languages on the internet. The European Union is the beginning of a planetary economy. Rock and roll, the beginning of planetary youth culture. Chanel and Gucci, the beginning of planetary high fashion.\n\nSo we\u2019re seeing the beginning of a planetary civilization, right in our own lifetime.\n\nIn 100 years, we will have our first starship. That\u2019s already planned \u2014 to build a starship within 100 years, but it\u2019s a primitive starship, very clunky, it looks like a Model T and is based on fusion.\n\nBy the time you\u2019re a Type 2 or Type 3 civilization, you have other ways to travel. So when scientists giggle, it\u2019s because they\u2019re ignorant of the fact that these can be Type 2 or Type 3 civilizations, in which case their technology is far beyond what we can even imagine. That\u2019s why we have to keep our eyes and ears open.\n\nIn your writings, you talk about how 99.99 percent of all species become extinct and that we need a Plan B or Planet B.\n\nThe dinosaurs didn\u2019t have a space program, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re not here today. We do have a space program. And people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. When they were children, they dreamed of going to the stars. Now they have billions of dollars. They can take out their checkbook now and create a moon rocket.\n\nWe\u2019re going to have a traffic jam around the moon very soon. Starting next year.\n\nWhat do you mean \u2014 all those satellites that Musk is planning to launch?\n\nAll the satellites, and NASA has the SLS [Space Launch System] booster that next year will be test-fired. If all goes well, it will orbit around the moon unmanned and a few years after that humans will board the SLS booster rocket with the Orion space capsule. Elon Musk has a parallel program where he creates his own rockets, the Falcon Heavy, fully capable of going to the moon. And Jeff Bezos has the Armstrong rocket. Then the Chinese have the Long March rocket. So think about that \u2014 not one, not two, not three, but four moon rockets. We\u2019re going to have a traffic jam around the moon.\n\nAnd Elon Musk would like to take it one step further and go to Mars. Then again, he has the rocket to prove it. It\u2019s called the BFR \u2014 \u201cB\u201d for big, \u201cR\u201d for rocket, \u201cF\u201d for your imagination. It\u2019s been dubbed \u201cThe Starship,\u201d and it\u2019s the biggest rocket on the books right now.\n\nWe need Plan B, an insurance policy. I don\u2019t think we should move our civilization to Mars \u2014 that\u2019s too expensive. [But] the cost is going down.\n\nIt costs $10,000 a pound [to put] anything into orbit around the Earth. To put you on the moon, it\u2019s about $100,000 a pound. To put you on Mars, about $1 million a pound. But the prices are dropping \u2014 that\u2019s the key.\n\nAnd now Elon Musk has a reusable rocket. Why\u2019s that important? Because if cars were not reusable, every time you took your car on a ride, you junked your car, cars would be prohibitively expensive. That\u2019s what we do with rockets. We junk them. Once rockets become fully reusable, that\u2019s going to open up space.\n\nMichio Kaku (Photo: Jos\u00e9 Colon for Yahoo News) More\n\nBeyond scientists, what\u2019s behind the knee-jerk reaction to dismiss any talk of alien life as tinfoil-hat blather? Is it a human distrust of \u201cthe unknown\u201d or what?\n\nLook at the year 1600, when the monk Bruno was burned alive in Rome for proclaiming there were aliens up there. The Catholic Church was threatened by the idea that you could have a civilization outside of the Catholic Church. Do they have the sacraments, do they have saints, do they have Jesus Christ, do they have the Trinity? It\u2019s better just to burn people rather than confront that.\n\nToday we don\u2019t burn astronomers anymore, thank goodness.\n\n[Johannes] Kepler wrote the first science fiction story, believe it or not. It was called \u201cThe Dream\u201d \u2014 he had to say it was a dream. He dreamed about going to the moon and visiting moon people. So he wrote the first modern science fiction story, but he had to write it as a dream because he knew what happened to Bruno.\n\nSo we\u2019ve always been frightened of \u201cthe other.\u201d As Arthur C. Clarke said, \u201cEither they\u2019re out there, or they\u2019re not. Either way, the thought is frightening.\u201d\n\nIf they\u2019re not out there, that means we\u2019re alone in the universe \u2014 that\u2019s frightening. And if they\u2019re there, it\u2019s frightening because then we wonder, \u201cWho are they? What do they want?\u201d\n\nMy colleague Stephen Hawking, the late physicist, said we should be careful announcing our existence. Because look what happened to Montezuma when he met Cort\u00e9s \u2014 he thought Cort\u00e9s was a god. In fact, Cort\u00e9s was a pirate and a plunderer of civilizations. He just wanted gold.\n\nSo what would aliens want?\n\nThat\u2019s the other question. Do they want gold, minerals, water?\n\nWell, we don\u2019t have anything that they would want. Gold is not precious for an extraterrestrial civilization. It\u2019s a rather useless metal as a conductor of electricity. Water? There\u2019s plenty of ice in outer space. We don\u2019t have anything they would want to plunder. So I think for the most part, they\u2019re going to be peaceful.\n\nIf they\u2019re already Type 2 or Type 3, they\u2019ve had plenty of time to work out sectarian, religious and racial differences. So I think for the most part, they\u2019ll be peaceful. But we should still be a little bit careful. We don\u2019t really know what their opinions are.\n\nSo tell us about your work in string field theory. You\u2019re trying to finish Einstein\u2019s equation?\n\nThat\u2019s right. We want to find the \u201cGod Equation\u201d \u2014 the ultimate theory that explains the entire universe. We want an equation that\u2019s maybe 1 inch long that would allow us to \u201cread the mind of God\u201d \u2014 those are Einstein\u2019s words.\n\nAnd how\u2019s it going?\n\nWe think we have it! It\u2019s called string theory. It\u2019s not in its final form, and it\u2019s not testable yet, [but] we have the Large Hadron Collider outside Geneva.\n\nWe\u2019re testing the periphery of the theory, but the theory itself is a theory of the universe \u2014 so it\u2019s very hard to test. But we physicists are optimistic. We think we will be able to test the theory. And we think it is the final theory. So physics ends at that point. Another era opens up, but one era ends when we finally prove this is the Theory of Everything.\n\nWhat\u2019s your office like? How do you work?\n\nIt\u2019s like how a musician works. Musicians have melodies playing in their heads. And they look out the window and once in a while they sit down at the piano and pluck out melodies. Then they go back to staring out the window again. Because they\u2019ve memorized all the notes, all the tunes, and they\u2019re just dancing in their head.\n\nFor us, it\u2019s equations, not melodies. I\u2019ve memorized all the equations of string theory \u2014 they\u2019re just floating in my head. And I have to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle, just like a musician pieces together notes to create a symphony. So it\u2019s close to music.\n\nIf string theory is correct, it means that all the subatomic particles \u2014 the electrons, the protons \u2014 are nothing but musical notes on a tiny vibrating rubber band. So that physics is nothing but the harmonies of the vibrating rubber bands. Chemistry is nothing but the melodies you can create from the vibrating strings. The universe is a symphony of strings.\n\nAnd the mind of God is cosmic music resonated through hyperspace.\n\nWith all your parallel universes, where does death fit into that model?\n\nLet\u2019s talk about immortality.\n\nWithin a few decades, we will have, first of all, digital immortality \u2014 that will come very fast \u2014 and eventually, genetic immortality. Digital immortality is when we digitize everything known about you \u2014 there are several companies advertising to digitize your relatives, so you can talk to your parents forever. It\u2019s not science fiction anymore.\n\nI would love to talk to Einstein. One day somebody will digitize everything known about him \u2014 his memoirs, diaries, tapes, interviews, everything. One day we may be digitized and our descendants, even our great-great-grandchildren, will want to talk to us because we have been digitized. So I think when we meet aliens from outer space, they\u2019ll be immortal.\n\nGenetic immortality is further down the line, but already we\u2019ve identified many genes, about 60 so far, linked to the aging process. But with what\u2019s called CRISPR technology, we\u2019ll have genetic engineering, and we\u2019ll be able to edit out a lot of the mistakes that cause aging. Aging, by the way, is error \u2014 a buildup of error in our DNA \u2014 that\u2019s what aging is: the accumulation of error. But we can correct these errors.\n\nSo genetic engineering will be possible. I think our grandkids might reach the age of 30 and stop. They may like being 30 for a few hundred years. This is coming very fast.\n\nWhen we meet aliens from outer space, I think they\u2019re probably be part genetic, part cybernetic, because the rigors of outer space are pretty severe.\n\nMichio Kaku (Photo: Jos\u00e9 Colon for Yahoo News) More\n\nI find your books are like a drug that pulls readers into a different world. Why do you write them? Why bother to explain all these things to the masses?\n\nWhen I was 8 years old, something happened which changed my whole outlook on life. They announced that a great scientist had died and in the evening newspaper they put a picture of his desk with an open book. And the caption said, \u201cThis is the unfinished manuscript of the greatest scientist of our time.\u201d So I said to myself, what could be so hard that a great man couldn\u2019t finish it?\n\nSo I went to the library over the years and read up on this strange man and his desk. It turns out his name was Albert Einstein, and that unfinished book was the unified field theory. I said this is better than any adventure story. I wanted to read that book that he couldn\u2019t finish. So today I can read that book \u2014 and I see all the dead ends and frustrations he had; today we can solve many of the equations that he couldn\u2019t because we have string theory.\n\nSo it\u2019s sad that Einstein died in 1955 because the string revolution was several decades later.\n\nDo you think humanity is still evolving?\n\nWith civilization, the smallest unit of history is the decade. Anything smaller and you get random fluctuations, and you go crazy trying to figure out all these blips and bumps. But if you look at it decade by decade, then you see the sweep of technology. You realized our grandparents lived before telephones, radios, the telegraph was just coming in, high speed travel was the horse, and long distance communication was yelling out the window. And people didn\u2019t live very long \u2014 for most of human history, life expectancy was about 30 or under. So today, when you look at it decade by decade, you see the enormous progress that was made. Every time I read the newspaper, I see the birth pangs of a Type 1 [planetary] civilization. It\u2019s not going to be easy, there are ups and downs, but that, I think, will be the greatest transition in modern civilization, when we hit Type 1 and have a planetary system \u2014 not necessary a planetary government, we\u2019ll have many governments \u2014but a planetary society, planetary thinking, a planetary culture. I think that\u2019s beginning already.\n\nSo you\u2019re optimistic?\n\nIn that sense, yes. I read political commentaries and they act like one little blip is the end of the world. And I say, it\u2019s just a blip you\u2019re talking about.\n\nLook at the march of history.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Physicist Michio Kiku talks with Yahoo News on topics from the state of human evolution to the upcoming traffic jam around the moon.", "authors": ["Melissa Rossi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DcZf0eMwuDwgVu2fl.NVVw--~B/aD0zMTg0O3c9NDc3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/314a29c0-d598-11e9-bf65-3d80a302e926", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
