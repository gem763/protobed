Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) brushed off claims that his presidential campaign wasn\u2019t being transparent when the presidential hopeful was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Sanders, 78, said of the criticism, according to NBC News. \u201cI don\u2019t know what people think campaigns are. You know we\u2019re dealing with all kinds of doctors, and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on, really.\u201d\n\nSanders said his campaign acted \u201cabsolutely appropriately\u201d by not rushing to alert the media after he was hospitalized.\n\n\u201cSo the first thing that we\u2019re trying to do is understand what\u2019s going on and not run to The New York Times and have to report every 15 minutes,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. \u201cYou know, this is not a baseball game. So I think we acted absolutely appropriately.\u201d\n\nWhen the Sanders campaign announced that the senator was hospitalized last week, they didn\u2019t specify Sanders\u2019 exact condition. The campaign noted only that Sanders had \u201cexperienced some chest discomfort\u201d and underwent an emergency heart procedure for a blocked artery.\n\nTwo and a half days later, Sanders was released from the hospital. At that time, his campaign issued a statement in which his doctors revealed he had a myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack.\n\nThe episode has thrust Sanders\u2019 health into the spotlight as one of the oldest candidates running for president. Critics have raised questions about whether he should campaign aggressively, but his staffers remain energized to move forward.\n\nBefore his heart attack, the senator promised to release his medical records before the Democratic primaries begin. He told reporters Wednesday that he would release those records \u201cat the appropriate time,\u201d according to Politico.\n\nSanders also said he had no intention of slowing down his campaign.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday. \u201cI love doing rallies, and I love doing town meetings.\u201d", "description": "Critics say the Sanders campaign wasn't being transparent when they didn't disclose his heart attack after he was hospitalized last week.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9e53fd21000042073435ea.jpeg?cache=ujl4sfrtqm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
