Only a fifth think departure will result in additional costs and red tape and two fifths say these will be unaffected.\n\nTrustees of schemes have given a great deal of thought to the impact of Brexit on their operations, and savers should be reassured their pensions are being looked after, reports the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association.\n\nBrexit preparations: More than half of pension schemes have taken steps to mitigate the risks of leaving the EU\n\nTo date, most concern about pensions after Brexit has focused on elderly expats, who have been told their state pensions will be uprated annually until 2023.\n\nHowever, after that decisions will be made in light of whether reciprocal arrangements with the EU are in place.\n\nThere is also the issue of whether expats in Europe face losing access to private pensions and other financial services in a no deal Brexit. The Association of British Insurers says it has done everything possible to prepare for this scenario.\n\nThe PLSA says nine out of 10 trustee boards of pensions schemes have discussed impact of Brexit on their scheme, up from around two thirds of them last year.\n\nThree quarters have discussed the potential impact on their sponsoring employer, and they did express some concerns about their capacity to support the scheme.\n\nSome 45 per cent believe that leaving the EU will have a negative impact on their employer 'covenant' - a measure of their ability to meet obligations.\n\nBut 43 per cent thought administration costs and complexity would be unaffected, while 20 per cent believed there would be an additional burden.\n\nLast year, 45 per cent of pension schemes thought Brexit would have a negative impact on the value of assets they hold, but this year that fell to 33 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, large majorities thought that a 'hard' Brexit would be worse for schemes and employers than an outcome where the UK retained access to the single market - see below.\n\nBrexit outcomes: Impact on pension schemes and employers of hard Brexit versus staying in the single market (Source: PLSA)\n\nThe PLSA says the top six actions schemes have take to mitigate Brexit risks are: reviewing asset allocation; reviewing the covenant; reviewing the currency hedging strategy; reviewing the hedging of non-currency risks; getting extra help from professional advisers; and changing asset allocation.\n\n'When we talk to our members, we hear a range of views about the extent to which Brexit will affect them, but they mostly cluster around how much they think Brexit is likely to impact their sponsoring employer rather than the operations of the scheme itself,' says James Walsh, head of member engagement at the PLSA.\n\n'This varies markedly depending on the nature of the business. For example some pension schemes with sponsors in the retail sector are worried that hold-ups at the ports could disrupt business and weaken the company.\n\n'But others tell us their sponsors are confident that their supply chains will remain robust or that their business is entirely based in the UK and will remain stable.'\n\nHe adds: 'Our survey shows pension schemes have given a great deal of thought to the impact of Brexit on their operations and are well prepared. Savers should be reassured that their pensions are looked after.'\n\nThe PLSA polled 71 schemes running final salary funds, which provide a guaranteed income after retirement, and defined contribution pension plans, where employers and staff pay into savings pots to fund retirement.\n\nThe PLSA represents in-house work pension schemes run by trustees, while the ABI's membership includes pension giants that employers contract to run schemes for their staff.", "description": "More than half of schemes surveyed have taken steps to mitigate the risks of leaving the EU.
