The first order of business will be a statement from the Prime Minister to update the House after the EU Council summit.\n\nAfter Mr Johnson\u2019s statement, the Government is expected to move its motion seeking MPs\u2019 approval for a Brexit deal.\n\nMPs have been able to table amendments since Thursday night, and Speaker John Bercow can select as many amendments as he wants, with votes taking place on those before the vote on the Government motion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong those include plans to extend the Brexit deadline again to prevent an \u2018accidental\u2019 no-deal departure as well as another that would include a second referendum.\n\nThe debate on the motion can run until any time on Saturday, and despite what people thought \u2013 and perhaps hoped \u2013 there is not a 2.30pm cut-off time.\n\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s Chief Brexit Negotiator have agreed a deal (Picture: PA)\n\nCould Boris Johnson get Brexit over the line?\n\nIt\u2019s a simple numbers game. There are 650 sitting MPs but the seven Sinn Fein MPs do not take their seats in Westminster and the Speaker and his three deputies do not vote.\n\nTherefore Mr Johnson needs 320 votes for his deal to pass.\n\nThe PM has 287 Tory MPs after he dramatically sacked 21 when they voted against him last month to make a no-deal Brexit illegal.\n\nHe has been attempting to win them over as well as a number of Labour rebels.\n\nHis traditional DUP allies have refused to back him, saying the new deal is a gross betrayal of them and the union.\n\nThe SNP, Labour and the Lib Dems alongside other smaller parties have all indicated they will not vote with Mr Johnson.\n\nSo far, there are 303 people on board with Mr Johnson and 301 confirmed against.\n\nEleven do not vote while 35 are still undecided. It really is too close to call.\n\nJeremy Corbyn will instruct Labour to vote against the deal (Picture: AFP)\n\nWhat happens if the deal passes?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the Prime Minister is successful in Westminster, it paves the way for the UK to leave on October 31.\n\nMEPs in the European Parliament still need to approve it.\n\nUK politicians will then need to sit late into the night in order to pass the necessary legislation to make Britain\u2019s EU withdrawal legally enforceable.\n\nThe Prime Minister would need to find a further majority for the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill in order to put Brexit on the statute books.\n\nMEPs would still need to agree to the vote passing (Picture: EPA)\n\nWhat happens if the deal fails?\n\nIf Parliament does not support the deal, Mr Johnson is compelled under the Benn Act to request a further Brexit delay to the end of January.\n\nAll 27 EU member states would have to agree to this and could decide a new date.\n\nEU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker piled the pressure on MPs to back the deal by raising doubts over any further delay to the UK\u2019s departure past October 31.\n\nBut European Council President Donald Tusk said if there is a request for an extension he will \u2018consult with other member states to see how they react\u2019.\n\nMr Johnson has said he does not want to ask for an extension, declaring it is \u2018no deal or no delay.\u2019\n\nFormer Conservative MP Oliver Letwin wants to officially rule out no-deal (Picture: PA)\n\nCould a no-deal Brexit still happen?\n\nPotentially. There are fears that even if Mr Johnson\u2019s deal passes through the House of Commons today, Parliament could run out of time to pass all the necessary legal steps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome critics of Boris Johnson suspect he is \u2018duping\u2019 MPs into backing him and he will simply run down the clock and leave without an arrangement by the end of the transition period in December 2020.\n\nTrade talks are supposed to happen within this transition period and we could still leave with no-deal if they fail.\n\nFormer Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin is trying to add an amendment to today\u2019s vote which would withhold approval of the deal unless and until implementing legislation has passed.\n\nThis keeps the Benn Act extension in place until all the legal boxes are ticked and would prevent an \u2018accidental no-deal departure.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s an important day in the House of Commons (Picture: AFP)\n\nHow rare is a Saturday sitting?\n\nThe Commons has only sat on four Saturdays since 1939, including on September 2 that year, due to the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nThe last time there was a Saturday sitting was April 3 1982 following the invasion of the Falkland Islands.\n\nMPs also sat on Saturday July 30 1949 in order to finish up business before the summer adjournment as well as on Saturday November 3 1956 due to the Suez crisis.", "description": "MPs are sitting to debate and vote on Boris Johnson's new Brexit bill that could pave the way for an October 31 EU departure.", "authors": ["Jane Wharton"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90523574_1571472118.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
