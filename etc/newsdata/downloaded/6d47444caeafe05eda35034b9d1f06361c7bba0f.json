As a result, Parliament will now sit on that day, the first time it has sat on a Saturday since the Falklands War.\n\nAllies of Jeremy Corbyn (pictured yesterday) are putting pressure on him to support the strategy as they fear that holding a general election first could result in a Tory victory\n\nBoris Johnson (pictured in Downing Street yesterday) could be ambushed by rebel MPs when the Commons holds a special Saturday sitting next week\n\nBut David Sassoli, president of the European Parliament, has indicated that Britain would only be granted an extension if there is a general election or a second referendum.\n\nAnd Mr Benn, the former shadow foreign secretary, has suggested that if there is no agreement, he would try to get a second referendum through the Commons on October 19.\n\nHe told BBC2's Newsnight on Wednesday: 'We have shown our capacity to take control of the order paper, so we won't be waiting just to see what the Prime Minister has in store for us.\n\n'This is a big opportunity for Parliament to say we can find a way forward and a confirmatory referendum is the way to do it.'\n\nMargot James, a former Tory MP who was expelled for opposing No Deal, indicated she would back a second vote.\n\n'It is vital that this time we actually do something concrete,' she said. 'I could support the Theresa May deal with a confirmatory referendum.'\n\nShadow Treasury minister Anneliese Dodds said: 'If we have that extension we would need to show it was for a reason \u2013 to have democratic input. Whether that is a general election or a confirmatory referendum is something we have been discussing.'\n\nThe debate on tactics is likely to dominate the next week if Boris Johnson fails to agree a Brexit deal (he is pictured trying to do so with Leo Varadkar yesterday)\n\nYesterday, former chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he did not support the idea of an election before Brexit had been resolved and said it was 'ironic' that MPs were being asked to 'turn the Government out'.\n\nHe said: 'I don't think an election solves our problem here. I would not support an election at the moment.'\n\nThe ex-Chancellor said a confirmatory referendum 'is not my preferred option', but did not rule one out.\n\nSpeaking in Northampton yesterday Mr Corbyn said he still wanted an election, followed by a referendum if Labour wins. He added that avoiding No Deal was the 'absolute priority' and said: 'After an election a Labour government would introduce legislation to ensure a referendum.'\n\nHowever, it has been reported that Mr McDonnell told the Shadow Cabinet meeting earlier this week that he was wary of an election before Brexit is settled \u2013 calling it a 'trap'.\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has expressed concern, while Labour deputy leader Tom Watson also backs a referendum before an election.\n\nAnd yesterday Miss Thornberry added her voice, saying: 'My concern about a general election is it would be a kind of quasi-referendum, that it would be all about in or out, what kind of deal, and so to a certain extent I can see the sense in trying to have a referendum first.'", "description": "Opposition and rebel MPs want to force Boris Johnson (pictured) into a lengthy Brexit extension and a new referendum by the end of March next year - with a UK election only following afterwards.", "authors": ["Daniel Martin Policy Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19558886-0-image-a-19_1570741139842.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
