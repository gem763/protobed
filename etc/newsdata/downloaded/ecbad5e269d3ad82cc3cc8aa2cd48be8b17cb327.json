If she wins her 24th Grand Slam singles title \u2014 at 37, against 19-year-old Andreescu \u2014 she will equal the accomplishments of Margaret Court, who has held the women\u2019s record for decades. Williams was just 17 when she won her first Grand Slam, on that very same court.\n\n\n\nWilliams has not only notched major accomplishments in tennis, however, and her ventures and endorsements have made her an estimated $225 million net worth, according to Forbes\u2019 list of America\u2019s Richest Self-Made Women.\n\n\n\nAccording to Forbes, in 2019 (they calculated to June), Williams made a total of $29.2 million, with $4.2 million coming from prize money and $25 million from endorsements.\n\n\n\nWilliams and her sister, Venus, got started on the court early with their father, Richard, who homeschooled the two athletes so they could spend more time on the court. Turning pro at 14, Williams won her first match at a Grand Slam competition in 1998, at just 16. She went on to win the U.S. Open in 1999, which was her first Grand Slam singles win, and she and her sister also won the doubles tournament that year. Currently, U.S. Open singles winners net a purse of $3.8 million.\n\n\n\nIn 2002, she won Wimbledon, and since then has racked up an astonishing 23 Grand Slam wins, all of which have purses in the millions of dollars.\n\n\n\nLike many athletes and celebs, Williams\u2019 biggest earnings come from endorsement deals. In 2004, she signed a five-year, $40 million endorsement deal with Nike. She also has sponsorships with Gatorade, Beats Electronics, Aston Martin, Intel, Wilson, and more, for undisclosed amounts.\n\n\n\nWilliams has turned some of that money into other business opportunities. She and Venus bought stakes in the Miami Dolphins and the UFC. She also launched her own clothing line.\n\n\n\nAnd how many homes does she own? \u201cI don\u2019t know, a lot,\u201d Williams has said. According to The Sun, she owns a 6,000-square-foot home in Beverly Hills near Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears worth $5.6 million dollars, a $2.2 million dollar home in Florida\u2019s Palm Beach Gardens that has its own spa, and a two-bedroom flat in Paris\u2019s seventh arrondissement with Eiffel Tower views, which she has shown off on Snapchat in the past. (The sale price on her flat wasn\u2019t made public, but others in the area are priced in the millions.)\n\n\n\nHer husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, with whom she welcomed a daughter just over a year ago, brings wealth of his own to their marriage. In 2006, the website was reportedly sold for at least $10 million. In 2014, Ohanian rejoined the company as an executive chairman, and Reddit is now the third most-visited website in the US, valued at $3 billion, according to Business Insider.\n\n\n\nWilliams reportedly wants to play through at least next year but seems to be planning her next act with that clothing line, S by Serena, and aims to launch jewelry and beauty product lines soon. She has also built a venture portfolio worth more than $10 million.\n\nLuckily for Williams, between the portfolio worth $10 million, the multiple homes worth roughly the same, and her numerous lucrative endorsement deals, her estimated net worth of $225 million should make retirement quite comfortable.\n\n\n\nLike what you see?
