Traffic lane discipline is also commonly linked with the charge.\n\nLast night, the mother-of-three was named as the woman to have allegedly knocked Mr Dunn off his bike.\n\nHis mother, Charlotte Charles, appealed to her to help the family start their grieving process amid claims she'd driven down the wrong side of the road on August 27.\n\n'If we have to, we will go to \u00adWashington,' she said. 'We just want to sit and talk with her. We don\u2019t \u00adunderstand how you can just get on a plane and leave behind the devastation she has without even speaking to us or facing us, or an apology of any kind.'\n\nHarry Dunn (pictured, right, and, left, with his mother) died following a crash near the RAF airbase in Northamptonshire\n\nMrs Sacoolas' husband, Jonathan, works at the airbase, which US intelligence personnel use.\n\nTheir children were enrolled at the \u00a324,500-a-year Winchester House private school in Brackley. Mr Dunn's father worked at the school as head of maintenance.\n\nYesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to contact US President Donald Trump if the country does not revoke Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity.\n\nHe vowed to make contact with Mr Trump as well as the US ambassador and said he hoped the matter will be 'resolved'.\n\nThe US Embassy in London said it would not comment on the identity of the driver who allegedly hit Mr Dunn.\n\nA spokesperson said that requests to strip diplomatic immunity garner 'attention at senior levels' but admitted that it is rare to waive immunity.\n\nOne former British intelligence officer accused the Americans of behaving 'very badly' and potentially abusing diplomatic immunity.", "description": "Anne Sacoolas, who allegedly knocked Harry Dunn off his motorbike near RAF Croughton, was fined in 2006 in Virginia for 'failure to pay full time and attention'", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/01/19421046-0-image-a-77_1570495982375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
