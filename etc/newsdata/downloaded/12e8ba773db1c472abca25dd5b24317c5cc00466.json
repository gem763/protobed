Even if you did, you probably did not go through with the idea. But this Bangladeshi politician did. She allegedly hired as many as eight lookalikes, to take the exam instead of her.\n\nUnfortunately (for her), the authorities found out and she was expelled from the university. Tamanna Nusrat, who is from the ruling party - Awami League Party - has been accused of paying her lookalikes to take 13 tests for her.\n\nThe cat leapt out of the bag when a private broadcaster from Nagorik TV entered the test hall and confronted one of the women who was posing as Nusrat. She was elected to the parliament last year and was studying with Bangladesh Open University for the degree of Bachelor of Arts.\n\nLookalike - Bhaskar/Tamanna Nusrat - Facebook\n\n\u201cWe expelled her because she has committed a crime. A crime is a crime,\u201d said the BOU head, MA Mannan. \u201cWe have cancelled her enrollment. She will never be able to get admitted here again.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss 350 SHARES 20.9 K SHARES 16.4 K SHARES 2.4 K SHARES\n\nA college official also said, \u201cThe proxy students were protected by the MP\u2019s muscle men when they sat for the tests. Everybody knew it but nobody uttered a word because she is from a very influential family.\u201d\n\nTest frauds, cheating is not so uncommon in Bangladesh, or even India! The good thing is, the authorities did not shy away from taking a stand just because she was a politician. Kudos to them for being brave and doing their duty diligently.", "description": "Have you ever been so unprepared for exams that you thought let\u2019s hire some lookalikes who can give your exam?
