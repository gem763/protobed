Having captured billions of users and tens of billions of dollars in annual profits, the company would now be taking over currency itself. The company\u2019s head of blockchain, David Marcus, laid out his plan for Libra in a detailed white paper, with some of the financial world\u2019s most powerful companies already signed on to help govern the new currency as part of the Libra Association. It was Facebook\u2019s vision for an international currency, and based on the company\u2019s partners, it seemed unstoppable.\n\nThat was then. The first to ditch Libra was Paypal, which withdrew on October 4th. Then, over the course of a few hours on October 11th, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and Mercado Pago all bailed on the project, with eBay tagging along for good measure. That meant every major US payment processor has exited the association. (The final remaining payment processor, PayU, has not responded to multiple requests for comment.) It\u2019s an alarming turnaround for the Facebook-backed project, and the first clear indication that Libra\u2019s founders may have bitten off more than they can chew.\n\nThis group of companies had particular reason to get cold feet\n\nLosing five companies in the span of a couple hours might seem like a panicked rush for the door, but the timing matters. On October 14th, all the founding members are set to convene in Geneva for the first ever Libra Council meeting. That\u2019s where they will hammer out the different roles to be played by the different parties and try to answer all the governance questions that aren\u2019t spelled out in the initial white paper. Ultimately, that will result in a formal charter, with each member signing their name to the new agreement.\n\nThat process is going to involve a lot of specific commitments from specific parties \u2014 so if anyone had doubts, the best time to get out was before the charter was signed. It also means that the quick exodus isn\u2019t quite as catastrophic as it looks. Anyone who\u2019s willing to sign their name on the charter is probably in for the long haul.\n\nThis group of companies had particular reason to get cold feet. With the exception of eBay, they\u2019re all payment processors, which means they have specific regulatory requirements dealing with fraud, money laundering and sanctions enforcement. Governments were starting to realize that Libra might make it hard to meet those requirements \u2014 and payment processors in particular would end up on the hook.\n\nAs Senators Schatz and Brown wrote to three of the departing companies, \u201cFacebook appears to want the benefits of engaging in financial activities without the responsibility of being regulated as a financial services company.\u201d The implication was clear: if Libra made things too easy for terrorists and money launderers, Visa, Mastercard and the others might end up taking the blame.\n\nthe troubles with payment processors point to a central problem in the Libra project\n\nThat\u2019s a scary thought for payment processors, who could see their central businesses wiped out by regulatory action. But for other companies in the Libra Association, that isn\u2019t a problem. The initial coalition includes a range of organizations, including charities, venture capital firms, and service providers like Lyft and Uber. Those companies don\u2019t face the same pressure from regulators, so there isn\u2019t the same benefit to ducking out.\n\nStill, the troubles with payment processors point to a central problem in the Libra project, one it may no longer be able to solve. Blockchain-backed coins work best as a self-contained system, but problems often arise in the places where they overlap with conventional banking. In the early days of Bitcoin, transaction processors were often prosecuted for not upholding anti-money laundering requirements \u2014 something many of the pioneering companies had never considered. It\u2019s only recently that US regulators have been able to enforce Know Your Customer requirements across wallet providers. The portals in and out of the ecosystem are the most important and legally sensitive parts of any new currency project \u2014 and Libra is no different.\n\nIn the initial vision, Libra handed those compliance issues off to payment processors, hoping Visa and Mastercard would be able to handle the intricate compliance requirements involved in trading dollars for Libra. But after Friday\u2019s mass exodus, that\u2019s no longer an option, and the same regulatory tangle that scared off the initial group of processors is likely to discourage others too. Anyone who steps into that role will have a huge task ahead of them, convincing governments around the world to clear the way for Libra at a time when public trust in Facebook has never been lower. It\u2019s not the end for Libra, but the project faces a hard path moving forward \u2014 and it\u2019s only getting harder.", "description": "Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and Mercado Pago all dropped out of Facebook\u2019s Libra Association in a matter of hours \u2014 but it\u2019s not quite as bad as it looks", "authors": ["Russell Brandom", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VepJ_PM0qjFTwITcikdjWc6oxiQ=/0x157:8000x4345/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16349406/XpzcVnoQ.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
