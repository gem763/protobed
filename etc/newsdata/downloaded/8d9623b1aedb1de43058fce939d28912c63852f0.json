None of those wars occurred when either country possessed nuclear weapons.\n\nPakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan addressed the United Nations on Sept. 29 and threatened to change that. Mr. Khan took the 15 minutes of speaking time allotted him and went nearly an hour, using the entire speech to speak of \u201cjihad\u201d over Kashmir and rail against his Indian counterpart, Prime Minister Nehendra Modi.\n\n\u201cJihad\u201d is not a word the world wants to hear from a man atop a self-described Islamic republic that owns more than 100 nuclear weapons.\n\nMr. Modi is on a strong run. He was re-elected this past spring in a landslide. He has made significant changes regarding Kashmir\u2019s status under the Indian constitution, changes which the Western media mostly misread or label \u201cannexation.\u201d He also addressed the United Nations the same morning as Mr. Khan, and spoke on Kashmir as well. Prior to the U.N. address, Mr. Modi visited Houston, Texas.\n\nMr. Modi attended the largest ever rally for a foreign leader on American soil. Fifty thousand tickets for the event, at the massive NRG Stadium, sold out quickly. Indian-Americans traveled to the \u201cHowdy, Modi!\u201d event from as far away as both coasts.\n\nNot only was Mr. Modi warmly received by the crowd in Texas, he invited and appeared with a special guest: President Donald Trump. In his address, Mr. Trump stressed the growing importance of the nearly 3 million Indian immigrants in America \u2014 and the growing importance of the U.S.-Indian relationship.\n\nAs if to underscore this burgeoning relationship, India inked a deal with an American company to buy $2.5 billion in Texas natural gas. This massive deal links India to the United States for fuel it needs to power its growing economy, and at the same time weakens Russia as an energy power. As natural gas replaces coal to generate electricity worldwide, the Texas deal will help reduce emissions and help the environment. The United States and India win from the relationship \u2014 but the likely loser is Pakistan.\n\nThat may be what is really behind Mr. Khan\u2019s threats. Kashmir is one of the world\u2019s deadliest and most intractable issues, and Mr. Modi\u2019s recent changes to Kashmir\u2019s status have surely alarmed Pakistan (though China, which also holds part of Kashmir, has said little about it).\n\nFor decades, the United States and Pakistan were allies, while India stayed closer to the Soviet Union. These relationships are all changing. The Soviet Union is dead. Pakistan has been found out as a source of global Islamist terrorism and nuclear weapons proliferation. It was Pakistan\u2019s Abdul Qadeer Khan (no relation to the prime minister) who sold Pakistani nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya.\n\nBut it is the fact that 9-11 terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden was living within a stone\u2019s throw of the Pakistan Military Academy (their meager version of our West Point), for years, that most severely strained U.S.-Pakistan relations. It is simply not plausible that Pakistan, which is to a great extent controlled by its military, was unaware of the mass murderer in its midst. The most positive spin possible is that Pakistan was merely a grossly incompetent ally \u2014 if it wasn\u2019t actively harboring bin Laden, which it very probably was. The Pakistani doctor who aided the Americans, Shakil Afridi, in the successful final search for bin Laden remains in Pakistani prison on nebulous charges. His imprisonment appears aimed at keeping him quiet.\n\n\u201cHowdy, Modi!\u201d must have rattled Islamabad and personally annoyed Mr. Khan. He rode to power as a national sports hero. Mr. Khan was the captain of Pakistan\u2019s 1992 world cup-winning cricket team. Cricket is to Pakistan what the NBA and NFL are to American sports fans, combined. Mr. Khan is accustomed to puffball media interviews, adoring crowds and a hero\u2019s welcome wherever he goes. But there was his Indian counterpart and historic enemy, standing on a stage in an immense modern stadium in a state where everything is bigger, with 50,000 Indian ex-pats shouting his name and the leader of the free world standing right by his side. The images and the relationship they portend may render Pakistan a footnote.\n\nWhile Kashmir is an issue the world claims to care about, the reality is that there are no black and white good vs. evil issues there. Kashmir is an extremely complex issue with far too much history and animosity built into it on all sides. There are allegations of brutality on India\u2019s part after the August status change, but there are also allegations that Mr. Khan\u2019s Pakistan is deploying Islamist terrorists into Indian Kashmir.\n\nFrom an American point of view, India may be, at the very least, the least bad option for Kashmir. Pakistan is unreliable and harbors the worst of the worst terrorists. It persecutes Christians. It is unstable and prone to internal violence. Mr. Khan himself works closely with Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, long a thorn in America\u2019s side. Together, they and Malaysia are collaborating on a global news network patterned after the BBC but which will, in their own words, \u201ccounter Islamophobia.\u201d Mr. Khan et al may want to consider the obvious: The best way to counter Islamophobia is to stop threatening jihad and running terrorist ratlines into contested territory \u2014 especially when you hold an arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n\nPakistan is deeply problematic, from an American point of view. China is a direct competitor and an open threat to America\u2019s democratic East Asia allies, including South Korea and Japan. Meanwhile, India poses no threat to America, and America doesn\u2019t threaten India. The two are strong democratic countries, one the world\u2019s largest, the other the world\u2019s oldest. Both pledge to fight Islamist terrorism. The possibility of greater trade and bilateral strategic relations exist and are likely to grow.\n\nMr. Modi and Mr. Trump have at least one thing in common that leaves Mr. Khan on the outside looking in: They have shown themselves capable of breaking out of calcified historic patterns. Where history suggests the United States should just stick with Pakistan and keep India at a distance, because that\u2019s the way it has always been, both Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi see no reason this should always be. Both men are deal makers, and they seem to see a deal possible that will benefit Americans, Indians and global security for the world\u2019s democracies.\n\n\u2022 Shak Hill, the owner of Guiding Light Books, LLC., is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and former combat pilot.
