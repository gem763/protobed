Ridiculous.\n\n\"We love you Mike.\"\n\nMike's wife Emily jumped in to thank Stacey for showing support to her disheartened husband.\n\n\"Thank you @StaceyDooley for bringing perspective and support,\" she wrote with a kiss emoji as sweet gesture.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nMirror Online excluisvely revealed Mike had been sent a chilling death threat warning him to quit the dance competition or be a \"dead man\".\n\nThe threat ordering him to pull out of the contest before this Saturday's show has left the BBC star and wife shocked.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nSpeaking at the Pride of Britain Awards, Mike, told us: \"It said that unless I withdraw from the competition now I'm a dead man.\n\n\"It was personal and I thought WTF. There are bigger things in the world to worry about.\n\n\"I get that people have their own favourite dancers but it's an entertainment show at the end of the day and to get a death threat is ridiculous.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"My wife saw it first and when I went to see who had sent it, they had already removed the tweet. A death threat? What?! On Strictly?\n\n\"You rise above it but it's people being cowardly isn't it?\n\n\"The show is meant to be happy, make people feel happy.\"", "description": "The former Strictly star has begged pal Mike not to quit the show in midst of troll abuse", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Twitter", "Bbc Guy Levy", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20071951.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Strictly-Come-Dancing-live-tour.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
