All support Obama and Crooked Hillary. Witch Hunt!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nBut the facts of the matter recited by the whistleblower and the accompanying transcripts and testimony over the last two weeks, even in the president\u2019s own statements, \u201cbolster the facts outlined in the extraordinary abuse-of-power complaint,\u201d The Post reported.\n\nThe transcript of the July 25 telephone conversation between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky accurately matches the whistleblower\u2019s charges.\n\nMr. Trump asked him in a phone call to \u201cdo me a favor\u201d by digging up the details that led to a high paying job on the board of a major Ukrainian energy company for Mr. Biden\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani [Trump\u2019s White House attorney] give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky in the White House account of their conversation. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will figure it out.\u201d\n\nWhy did Mr. Trump want Mr. Zelensky to dig up dirt on Mr. Biden and his son? To use it in his upcoming 2020 campaign if Mr. Biden becomes the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nTo date, nothing has been proven to show that Hunter Biden, or his father, did anything wrong, but that\u2019s not going keep Mr. Trump from leveling corruption charges in the midst of his campaign if it will help him win re-election.\n\nMr. Trump came into office in the midst of a huge scandal: That Russia interfered in the election by conducting a high level cyberwar campaign within our nation\u2019s internet that helped him win the presidency. Mr. Trump called the scandal a hoax and \u201cfake news\u201d and denies he had anything to do with it.\n\nBut our intelligence community says it was real and had an impact on our last election, despite Vladimir Putin\u2019s persistent denials.\n\nAt their last face to face meeting, Mr. Trump said he asked Mr. Putin if Russia played a role in the attack on our elections, and the former KGB agent said it did not. Mr. Trump said he believed him.\n\nNow Mr. Trump has asked the president of Ukraine to do him \u201ca favor\u201d by launching an investigation into the leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThat has spawned a full impeachment inquiry in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on the basis of a rough transcript of what he asked the Ukrainian president to do for him.\n\nMr. Trump insists he did nothing wrong, but a Washington Post-Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University poll found this week that by a margin of 58 percent to 38 percent, \u201cAmericans say the House was correct to open the inquiry.\u201d\n\nMoreover, \u201ca clear majority of Americans say Trump\u2019s request to investigate Biden and his son was inappropriate (62 percent to 32 percent who thought it was not).\u201d\n\nLet the House impeachment inquiry begin.\n\n\u2022 Donald Lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
