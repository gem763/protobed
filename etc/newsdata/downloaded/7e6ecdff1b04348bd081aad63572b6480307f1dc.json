We have not seen that since we started this research in 2008-09,\" Wolfgang Koester, senior strategy officer of Kyriba, said.\n\n\"We've also never had a $44 billion loss for the start of a year since we've been reporting it.\"\n\nKyriba, which acquired currency risk consulting firm FIREapps earlier this year, said 291 North American companies reported negative currency impacts in the second quarter, roughly the same as in recent quarters.\n\nA stronger dollar can hurt large U.S. companies that derive much of their revenue from abroad as they repatriate foreign earnings.\n\nAt the end of the second quarter, the U.S. dollar had risen nearly 3% against the euro from a year earlier. ( )\n\nInvestors have favored the dollar for many months, thanks to relatively high U.S. interest rates and a strong economy.", "description": "Currency hit to North American companies' results stays above $20 billion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9G10Z_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
