The remaining four were still in the area off Sugar Beach in the coastal town of Kihei.\n\nPygmy killer whales are often confused with false killer whales and melon-headed whales. The species is found primarily in deep waters throughout tropical and subtropical areas of the world.\n\nEleven pygmy killer whales stranded on the same beach on Aug. 29. One calf died and officials euthanized four adults after that stranding. Dorsal fin marks showed different individuals were involved in the two stranding events.\n\nSchofield said two separate strandings of the same species in the span of several weeks raises concerns there might be a disease afflicting the Hawaiian pygmy killer whale population. Scientists won\u2019t know whether this is the case until necropsies are conducted.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether there is any relation between the strandings and a warming planet.\n\nMarine mammals sit at the top of the food chain and are considered indicators of ocean health, Schofield said. And though temperatures in waters around Hawaii this summer hit highs second only to 2015, Schofield said it would be \u201cvery difficult to speculate\u201d and connect the strandings to global climate change.\n\nThe bodies of the dolphins were being flown to Oahu for post-mortem examination by the University of Hawaii.\n\nNOAA officials initially reported the animals from the August stranding were melon-headed whales, but they turned out to be pygmy killer whales.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Wildlife officials in Hawaii on Tuesday euthanized two emaciated, sick dolphins that stranded on a Maui beach less than a month after another mass stranding in the same area.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Audrey Mcavoy"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
