Photo: Courtesy of the retailer\n\nAs a writer\u200b, \u200bsmall publisher, \u200band mother of two small boys, \u200bI read a lot of stories. But there\u2019s a particular kind of bedtime story that I inevitably position on top of the pile: children\u2019s books from artists.\n\nWe often compartmentalize art for adults and art for children, but that\u2019s a mistake. I\u2019ve discovered that the same artists whose work speaks to me within, say, the walls of a small gallery are also able to connect with kids in an intimate storytelling setting. There\u2019s actually a tradition of this that includes Salvador Dali\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland (1969), David Hockney\u2019s Six Fairy Tales from Brothers Grimm (1970), and Faith Ringgold\u2019s Tar Beach (1996). In my opinion, contemporary artists should be creating more books for spongy young minds \u2014 especially because we parents will end up reading them out loud four consecutive times a night.\n\nWhen asked to explain to someone what I do all day, my older son once said, \u201cShe\u2019s a mom, a worker, and a bookmaker\u200b.\u200b\u201d I guess\u200b that \u200bmakes me an authority on these things. Below is \u200ba list\u200b of children\u2019s books by artists whose reputation extends beyond the bunk bed. Incidentally, all of these would make wonderful birthday or holiday gifts \u2014 for parents and kids who might have Carle and Boynton fatigue. Some \u200bare \u200bharder to find than others,\u200b but\u200b most \u200bare now \u200bavailable online. This reminds me of when my son also good-naturedly trolled me: \u201cCan you go viral with books?\u201d I like to think of an extended network of kids all thinking about these same bedtime stories.\n\nIt makes perfect sense that Yayoi Kusama would create a wonderland of spotted mushrooms for Lewis Carroll\u2019s classic, red and white, but purple and yellow too. Meanwhile, Kusama\u2019s black-and-white illustrations for the dark original The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen were pulled together by the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark from her Love Forever series (2004-2007).\n\nPicasso's Animals, drawings by Pablo Picasso $15 (was $19, now 21% off) Perhaps most well known among Picasso\u2019s own pets was a dachshund named Lump, although there was also cigarette-smoking Monina the monkey. This book has photographs, drawings, and stories of the animals in the painter\u2019s life. It is not explicitly a children\u2019s title, per se, but it certainly looks like one and can be enjoyed as one. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nBirds & Other Animals with Pablo Picasso $9 (was $10, now 10% off) This board book of similar animal line drawings is intended for children. A single line turns into both penguin and rooster on facing pages. Later on, a preening flamingo and baby chicks. In another spread, a thinly sketched fox is vis-\u00e0-vis a pack of drawn bunnies, as if the very same line has transformed into each creature throughout. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nSix Fairy Tales from Brother\u2019s Grimm, illustrations by David Hockney $17 (was $25, now 32% off) I love the black-and-white etchings made to accompany each of the six stories chosen from the classic collection. This includes a lovely line drawing of a boy in bed with a splash of paint, entitled \u201cCold water about to hit the Prince\u201d from the lesser known, \u201cThe Boy Who Left Home to Learn Fear.\u201d $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nFitcher's Bird, photographs by Cindy Sherman Another Brothers Grimm tale, this time a photographic fictional narrative realized by Sherman in 1992. The story revolves around a bad wizard that dresses up as a beggar to kidnap beautiful girls. Beyond the obvious scary undertones, this is a tale of cunning sisters battling the patriarchy and helping one another. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nLife Doesn't Frighten Me, paintings by Jean-Michel Basquiat $19 (was $20, now 5% off) A line from poet and activist Maya Angelou\u2019s poem that serves as the text in this book reads, \u201cI\u2019ve got a magic charm / That I keep up my sleeve.\u201d Another reads, \u201cStrangers in the dark / No, they don\u2019t frighten me at all.\u201d This line is paired with a painting by Basquiat of a bipedal bear raising its arms with a thick white trail of teeth. This book pairs separate, preexisting work from two well-known figures in their respective worlds. Putting Angelou and Basquiat together in this way is to the credit of editor Sara Jane Boyers. $19 at Amazon Buy $19 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Furious Hamster, by Keren Cytter These books are small-scale paperbacks with bright marker-and-pen drawings and layered narratives. Toward the end of The Furious Hamster, Cytter writes, \u201cAnd, children, if you want to know where they went, who they met and what they looked like, you will have to learn to read tiny letters that usually appear in books for teenagers and adults.\u201d The Israeli author and writer makes video and performance art, but she\u2019s written novels and poetry, as well. $17 at Les Presses Du Reel Buy\n\nThe Autobiography of a Snake, drawings by Andy Warhol The Pop Art master made an expansive and diverse body of work that included an early stint as an illustrator in the late \u201950s for Doubleday\u2019s series of children\u2019s books. Warhol created the drawings for No. 15 in The Best of Children\u2019s Books Series, a story called The Little Red Hen in which the lead character is an elegant flamingo-pink chicken. He did the drawings for five other editions, including No. 27 in the series, the black-and-red pictures for Card Games are Fun. These can be found online in inexpensive used anthologies. Three years ago, Thames and Hudson put out a previously unpublished children\u2019s book written and illustrated by Warhol called The Autobiography of a Snake. Perhaps not surprisingly, it\u2019s the story of a reptile trying to succeed in \u201960s society. From $12 at Amazon Buy From $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nSomething to Put Something On, by Lawrence Weiner This is not a straightforward storybook, rather an introduction to conceptual and text-based art. In Weiner\u2019s orange, red, and blue typography, he asks, \u201cA table is something you put something on / Isn\u2019t a table something? / Isn\u2019t everything something?\u201d The reader is asked to consider the abstract nature of an object, even one such as a book. The illustrations are mostly lines, circles, and letters \u2014 text as still life, words as artwork. $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Shadow and Her Wanda by Paul Chan $6 (was $16, now 63% off) This book was commissioned by the Serpentine gallery as part of Chan\u2019s 2007 show. The beloved multi-hyphenate author is himself a sometime publisher (Badlands Unlimited) and writer who often plays with literary and philosophical references in his own work. This softcover limited edition includes footnotes to Nietzsche and Google, among others. The cover line reads, in parentheses, \u201cstrictly for children,\u201d meaning exactly the opposite. On one page, the young Wanda says to the shadow, \u201cYou are the night of my world.\u201d To which the shadow replies, \u201cSilly, the world shines anew in the dark.\u201d There is, of course, an accompanying footnote that discusses Hegel. $6 at Amazon Buy $6 at Amazon Buy\n\nTar Beach by Faith Ringgold $7 (was $8, now 13% off) The Harlem-born artist and activist Ringgold\u2019s first solo show at a European institution opened this past summer at the Serpentine. She began as a painter and then started working in story quilts, soft sculpture in bright fabrics telling the tale of Cassie Louise Lightfood. Here, they are transferred to the printed page. The 8-year-old who\u2019s living in Harlem in 1939 flies through the sky, arms spread in a yellow dress with a big red bow, three braids tied with the same color ribbon. The bottom border is from the original quilt. \u201cI will always remember when the stars fell down around me and lifted me up above the George Washington Bridge,\u201d the text reads. The original piece was made in 1988 and is now in the permanent collection of the Guggenheim. From $7 at Amazon Buy From $7 at Amazon Buy\n\nAnimal Sketching by Alexander Calder Like Picasso\u2019s Animals, this is a compendium of sketches from a masterful sculptor that can be shared with children. It is intended as a kind of guide for students learning to draw various poses. I love that it is an affordable, widely-available reproduction of an original from the late \u201920s. $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Lonely Doll by Dare Wright I would feel remiss not including this iconic photo narrative of an apron-wearing doll named Edith and Mr. Bear. The book is the first in a series by artist-photographer Dare Wright, which has become known for both its subversive story (one spread features the said doll gagged) and particular aesthetic: pink-and-white gingham cover and black-and-white posed photos. It\u2019s inspired an intense mix of feeling in a generation of creatives (Kim Gordon talked about it in this Times article). Still, its cult following doesn\u2019t seem to be waning anytime soon with a movie in the works (reportedly to be directed by Gia Coppola). $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nTouch the Sky With Your Eye by David Horvitz A collection of beautiful watercolors with text in both English and French. There is a beautiful image on Instagram of Horvitz using found scallops shells as the paint dishes while working on this very book. This too is about the ABC\u2019s, but a long-form poem with ideas for actions or playing pretend in relation to each letter. $17 at Jean Bo\u00eete \u00c9ditions Buy $17 at Jean Bo\u00eete \u00c9ditions Buy\n\nAda by Alex Katz This catalog of drawings the artist did of his wife alongside text about her is not explicitly intended for children, but its short prose and layout lend themselves to this list. It\u2019s a love letter to Katz\u2019s wife, the subject of many of his paintings. My favorite anecdote tells the story of Katz and Ada in a gallery, where he remarks, \u201cThat\u2019s the best Ellsworth Kelly I ever saw.\u201d She replies, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d And when she goes to the desk to look at the checklist, it, indeed, turns out to be Malevich. $30 at Lococo Fine Art Buy\n\nAbout Two Squares by El Lissitzky A revolutionary book when it was first released in 1922 by a left-leaning publishing house run by Russian Symbolist poets. New printing technology allowed Lissitzky to experiment with spacing and fonts. He tells the story of two squares, a red one symbolizing Communism and a black one for Suprematism \u2014 effectively the artist Kazimir Malevich\u2019s work Black Square, made in 1913. The book introduces an abstract allegory to young minds \u2014 whether or not they understand its many meanings is not so important. The story ends with ellipsis, asking the reader to invent her own story of a post-conflict world. From $20 at Amazon Buy From $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nTwo Kids, One Grown-up by John Baldessari This is a project close to me, a book I co-published as the first in a series of seven children\u2019s books by contemporary artists. It\u2019s equal parts mixed-up abecedarian, bestiary, exhibition catalog, and children\u2019s book. The alphabet borrows from the first letter of a series of Baldessari\u2019s animal emoji paintings reproduced as a nonlinear narrative in half digi-speak. $65 at Amazon Buy $65 at Westreich Wagner Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
