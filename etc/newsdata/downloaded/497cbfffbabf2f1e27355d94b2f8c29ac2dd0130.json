Stop what you\u2019re doing, take that Canadian flag that you definitely own, and fly it at half-mast. Pour one out from your two-four of Molson. Tell Alexa to play \u201cMy Heart Will Go On.\u201d Watch this YouTube compilation of every time David and Patrick kiss on Schitt\u2019s Creek and cry big, fat, frozen tears. For today is a somber day, not only for Canadians, but for fans of physical beauty and athletic excellence the world over, and for all believers in true, quasi-platonic, sultrily choreographed love. Like an ice pick to the heart, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir announced their retirement from the sport \u2014 nay, the art \u2014 of ice dancing on Tuesday. Needless to say, this news made us all feel like Justin Trudeau falling down the stairs. The two-time gold medal\u2013winning duo, who skated their way into our hearts when they won their first gold at the Vancouver 2010 Olympics, announced that it was time to hang up their skates from their 22-year partnership, one that\u2019s definitely just professional, certainly just ice-acting, in a video posted to their Twitter accounts:\n\nIn the selfie video, the two wear funeral black and skate around the rink, the stands in the background empty like our hearts, addressing the camera. Thee footage cuts to videos of Virtue and Moir growing up on the ice before our eyes, a supercut of Virtue dramatically stage-fainting into Moir\u2019s arms, as children and teens and adults, and Moir catching her every time. It cuts back to Tessa gazing up at Scott in ways that make you second-guess whether you\u2019ve actually ever felt true love before. Moir puts his arm around her. Tessa says, \u201cAfter 22 years, it feels like the right time to step away from the sport [\u2026] this is so personal and emotional for both of us. We\u2019re just so grateful.\u201d Scott says they feel like \u201cthe most fortunate kids in Canada.\u201d The music swells. They assure us they still love us, essentially saying the ice divorce isn\u2019t our fault, and that they still care about each other very much, and that we\u2019ll still be able to see them.\n\nIt isn\u2019t goodbye, though. Tessa and Scott have come out of retirement once before, to win gold at Pyeongchang, so it\u2019s not unheard of that they\u2019ll skate again. Also, in the video they tease that we can still catch them on their upcoming \u201cRock the Rink\u201d tour, which will see them melting hearts and rinks in 20-plus Canadian cities, and also Cleveland. So if you ever wanted to visit Newfoundland in late November, you finally have a reason.", "description": "Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, everyone\u2019s favorite ice dancing team, announced that they have retired from the sport that earned the Canadian duo two gold medals.
