That\u2019s the highest second-quarter debt increase in the country.\n\nGranted, WalletHub notes that Americans collectively began the year already owing more than $1 trillion in credit card debt. And its analysis of TransUnion and Federal Reserve data finds that consumers racked up another $35.6 billion in credit card debt during the second quarter of 2019, which set a second quarter buildup record. Worse, WalletHub projects that U.S. consumers will end the year with a net increase of $70 billion in credit card debt.\n\nAnd Californians racked up the most debt during the second quarter, with the state tab totaling $124.9 billion, followed by Texas (which added $3.1 billion in debt), Florida ($2.3 billion), New York ($2.3 billion) and Illinois ($1.5 billion).\n\nBut while these states are digging more deeply into debt the fastest, their residents are not the ones shouldering the highest amount of money owed. That troubling distinction goes to Alaska, where the average household is in the red for $12,626. That\u2019s partly because residents of the Last Frontier also take the longest to pay their balances off \u2014 at 19 months and 11 days on average, according to a previous WalletHub report.\n\nRelated: This is the worst state to have credit card debt\n\nOf course, it\u2019s taking many Americans longer to pay off their balances. A recent report from CreditCards.com found that more than one in three cardholders \u2014 some 39 million Americans \u2014 have been in debt for at least two years. And a growing number of Americans have more credit-card debt than savings.\n\nHow did we get here? More than one in three people told CreditCards.com that emergencies such as car repairs, medical bills and home repairs first put them into debt, although day-to-day expenses (28%) and discretionary spending (27%) also got them in over their heads.\n\nFor those looking to clear their balances, but who are unsure where to start, these inspirational stories can help point you in the right direction. They include a woman who paid off $10,000 in credit card debt \u2014 although it took two personal loans and an overhaul of her spending habits.\n\nThis man paid off $10,000 in credit-card debt after having a revelation \u2014 at the Gap.\n\nAnd a young family racked up $16,000 in credit-card debt \u2014 but they managed to pay that off and save up another $16,000 in two years.
