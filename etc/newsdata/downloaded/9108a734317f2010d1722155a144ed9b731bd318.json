To make matter worse, Manchester City have scored the most and are averaging over three goals a game this term.\n\nThe existing record was first set by Ipswich Town in 1995 when the already doomed to relegation Tractor Boys were breached 15 times in defeats at Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Norwich City.\n\nAston Villa then matched the record 17 years later when they suffered a miserable Christmas thanks to thrashings by Chelsea, Tottenham and Wigan.\n\nBut Aston Villa equalled the record in 2012 with a run that started with an 8-0 loss at Chelsea\n\nThat was followed up by a Gareth Bale hat-trick as Spurs triumphed 4-0 at Villa on Boxing Day\n\nDespite Paul Lambert's side awful run - his side managed to improve and see off relegation\n\nThe Latics actually hold the unwanted accolade of conceding the most goals across three games but their run was across two campaigns.\n\nOpposition teams struck 18 times in the space of three hours of football, with Chelsea putting eight past them on the final day of the 2009-10 season.\n\nThat was then followed up with Roberto Martinez's team losing 4-0 at home to newly promoted Blackpool on the opening weekend of the 2010-11 season and again against Chelsea who fired in six without reply at the DW Stadium.", "description": "It's been a miserable few days for Southampton but it could get worse when they visit Manchester City for the second time in a week as they look to avoid matching another unwanted record.", "authors": ["Dan Ripley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/13/20375988-0-image-a-34_1572440907088.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
