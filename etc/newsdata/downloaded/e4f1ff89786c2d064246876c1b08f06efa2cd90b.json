Indeed, how many leaders do we want to lose to it?''\n\nEnergy Minister Angus Taylor said \"we would love Labor to support our policy''.\n\n\"They are clearly recognising the error of their ways.''\n\nBut shadow climate and energy minister Mark Butler slapped down Mr Fitzgibbon's idea, saying it would be inconsistent with the Paris agreement.\n\n\"It would lead to global warming of more than 3C and, for that reason, Labor cannot support that target. That has been a consistent position of ours since we first took advice about what Tony Abbott\u2019s target would mean for climate change,'' he said.", "description": "Labor's commitment to increase the Newstart allowance could require the party to retain some of its more unpopular revenue-raising policies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2562%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dbbaf93ddfb34d7c969362739bcfa9943f2ee051", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
