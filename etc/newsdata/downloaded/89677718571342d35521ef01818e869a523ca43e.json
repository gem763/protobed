The company added that it made the decision after \"closely monitoring\" an alert last month from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that said some of the tested pills contained small amounts of a \"probable\" cancer-causing chemical.\n\nCVS pulls Zantac after traces of known carcinogen\n\nWalmart said customers who have purchased the products may return them to a Walmart or a Sam's Club for a refund.\n\nLast month, the FDA identified the carcinogenic chemical as a type of nitrosamine called N-nitrosodimethylamine, or NDMA. While the agency said patients could continue taking Zantac and similar heartburn medications for now, CVS on Monday said it was pulling Zantac over health concerns. Walgreens and Rite Aid have also removed the medications from their shelves, according to Reuters.", "description": "Retailer is suspending all over-the-counter ranitidine products, including Zantac and Equate, following FDA alert", "authors": ["Aimee Picchi"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/02/97e64890-9165-4965-956c-e1eef398c118/thumbnail/1200x630/e018d2737d456344e91bcbe89aa66718/rtx75n33.jpg"}
