It\u2019s like some sort of lay-by. The Little Chef of the galaxy.\n\n\u201cThe lady who lived next door - who was a very respectable lady and wouldn\u2019t make up stories - told us that one morning she was in the kitchen making a coffee and a flying saucer came down and hovered over her back garden.\u201d\n\nSheen insisted both he and his dad had had similar experiences.\n\n(Image: Jonathan Myers)\n\nHe explained: \u201cOne day I was coming home from school. I was just about to turn up the path to my house and coming round the mountain was a formation of lights.\n\n\u201cThere was a formation of some things coming round and going out across the sea then disappearing.\n\n\u201cThen years later on New Year\u2019s Eve about five years ago - my dad, who had not had a drink that night, went up to bed.\n\n\u201cHe said he saw a thing in the sky with lights going around it - it was there for ages then it shot off. My dad is a character but is not someone who would make this up.\n\n\u201cPort Talbot is some kind of hub.\u201d\n\nSheen was speaking at Richard Herring\u2019s award-winning Leicester Square Theatre podcast.\n\nHost Richard quipped: \u201cPeople in Port Talbot maybe haven\u2019t seen a helicopter before - could it be that?\n\nTo which Sheen humorously replied: \u201cThat is entirely possible.\u201d", "description": "Sheen, 50, grew up in Port Talbot in South Wales before finding fame in movies such as The Damned United, The Queen and Frost/Nixon", "authors": ["Adam Aspinall", "Image", "Dave Benett Getty Images For Hug", "Jonathan Myers"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20628744.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JIP_CHP_161019talbot_1733JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
