Her new novel, Heaven, My Home, is the sequel to Bluebird, Bluebird and part of her Highway 59 series exploring race, power and freedom and featuring the black Texas ranger Darren Mathews; in the new novel, he is searching for missing nine-year-old Levi, who comes from a family of white supremacists. Locke is also a screenwriter and producer, including for Empire, When They See Us and Little Fires Everywhere.\n\nWhat inspired you to write about a Texas ranger?\n\nI\u2019d been working in television and got to know how much fun it could be hanging out with a character over a series. I came up with this idea that it would be a Texas ranger. I like underdogs and outsiders and I found a way he could be both and that is his fundamental contradiction: Darren is an authoritarian figure, but at the same time he\u2019s conflicted about it. When I ended Bluebird, Bluebird on a cliffhanger, I knew I had to come back and finish the story.\n\nThe novel explores anxieties ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration...\n\nWhen I look back I will say they are a Trump-era series. I wrote Bluebird, Bluebird before Trump was elected \u2013 white-supremacist thought was present during his campaign, but I didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d ever be elected. I made the decision to set Heaven, My Home right before Trump was inaugurated as so many people felt anxiety in that window between election and inauguration. This book is more personal; I was wrestling with the concept of forgiveness. There was this incident at my daughter\u2019s school: a white kid called a black kid the N-word and I was shocked and filled with rage. My daughter had a willingness to forgive him. She\u2019s 12 now. I looked at the mother of the black child and started weeping and saw the child who said that word and I felt sick inside; that\u2019s where the character of Levi came from, trying to work out why I couldn\u2019t forgive a child. I\u2019m working from my own pain.\n\nAnd did your feelings about forgiveness change?\n\nNo. I still sit at a crossroads not knowing how I feel. Do black people always have to be the ones doing the forgiving? Do we go on being the bigger person into perpetuity, or is there a limit to forgiveness?\n\nAs a child I did a lot of looking out the window at creeks and people boiling peanuts from their pick-up trucks\n\nYou movingly explore the theme of home...\n\nThe title Heaven, My Home is from a blues song. A lot of black roots music can never quite pen a permanent location for home, and I think that speaks to the black American experience: when they came here not having a home that was theirs \u2013 they could be moved anywhere. For me, that music has served a real purpose. When I\u2019ve had struggles in my life where I felt racial pain, I play blues songs.\n\nWhere do you feel at home?\n\nI live in LA now, but Texas is my home in a way that will never be displaced in my heart and soul. It\u2019s the lens through which I see the world. I don\u2019t mean its current state or politics. I mean I come from rural, agrarian people. There\u2019s a fortitude I draw on when I struggle: a practicality of life that comes from my Texas upbringing, particularly my agrarian upbringing. Texas is very deeply my home.\n\nA lot of your family come from towns along Highway 59. How did that spark your imagination?\n\nAs a child we were always driving up and down 59 to see relatives. I didn\u2019t have an iPod or iPad back in the day, so I did a lot of looking out the window at creeks and pine trees and people selling fresh fruit and boiling peanuts out of their pick-up trucks. These are some of my earliest childhood memories. That\u2019s where the impulse to write about that came from.\n\nAttica Locke: \u2018When Trump was elected, overnight my book changed. I didn\u2019t alter a word\u2019 Read more\n\nWhat appeals to you about crime fiction?\n\nThe thing that fascinates me about crime fiction is that it gets to the heart of human nature in a visceral way. I\u2019m fascinated by what makes people behave the way they behave.\n\nWhat kind of reader were you as a child?\n\nSporadic. I wasn\u2019t one of these kids who always had a book with them like I do now: I take a book everywhere, including the grocery store. I loved To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nWhat books are on your bedside table?\n\nI\u2019m reading Fleishman Is in Trouble [by Taffy Brodesser-Akner]. I love it a lot.\n\nWhat current writers do you admire?\n\nSo many. Megan Abbott. Kate Atkinson \u2013 Life After Life is my favourite. Laura Lippman. Jesmyn Ward and Tayari Jones.\n\nDid you always want to be a writer?\n\nI wrote as a child and adolescent. Then I fell in love with movies and for a long time wanted to be a movie director. I moved to LA, but it all fell apart, and one day I said I don\u2019t want to do it any more, so I decided to write a book. Having given myself the gift of time, I found my voice.\n\nWhat books have influenced your writing?\n\nJane Smiley\u2019s 13 Ways of Looking at the Novel was super-helpful to me when I wrote my first book. The book is a hybrid memoir and love letter to the novel. Its gift to me was expressing what was possible and deconstructing a lot of myth around writing. There\u2019s a quote in it which I\u2019ll paraphrase: \u201cThe only way you can fail at a first draft is not to finish it.\u201d As a new writer I needed to hear that.\n\n\u2022 Heaven, My Home by Attica Locke is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail (\u00a314.99).
