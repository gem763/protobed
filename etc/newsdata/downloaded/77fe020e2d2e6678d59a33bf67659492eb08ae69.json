(Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images)\n\nNorth Korea test-fired a ballistic missile into the sea off Japan on Wednesday, a short while after announcing a resumption of negotiations with the United States over its nuclear weapons program, in what appeared to be a calculated show of strength.\n\nSouth Korea said the ballistic missile was launched from the sea, possibly from a submarine, a development that underlined North Korea\u2019s continued progress in missile development and its ever-growing military threat.\n\nThe U.S. State Department called on North Korea to \u201crefrain from provocations, and abide by its obligations under U.N. Security Council Resolutions.\u201d\n\nIt also encouraged Pyongyang to \u201cremain engaged in substantive and sustained negotiations to do their part to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and achieve denuclearization.\u201d\n\nThe launch came a day after North Korea announced that negotiations between the two sides would formally begin on Saturday, marking the first official talks since President Trump met Kim Jong Un in June.\n\n[John Bolton has finally spoken, and he put up a big warning sign about Trump and North Korea]\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s presidential Blue House said it \u201cplaced weight on the possibility\u201d that the missile was launched from a submarine off North Korea\u2019s east coast. But a U.S. official, who was not named, told CNN the missile was launched from an underwater platform, although it was designed to function as a submarine-launched ballistic missile.\n\nJapan\u2019s government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, initially said the country had detected two ballistic missiles. But he later said it may have been one missile that broke into two pieces, adding that one piece may have landed in the waters of Japan\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\n\nOn Tuesday, North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said Pyongyang and Washington \u201cagreed to hold a working-level discussion on October 5th, following a preliminary contact on the 4th,\u201d according to a statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency.\n\n\u201cI expect the working-level talks to accelerate positive developments in DPRK-U.S. relations,\u201d Choe said, using the initials of her country\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. \u201cOur representatives are ready to attend the working-level talks with the United States.\u201d\n\nState Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus also told reporters that officials from the two countries plan to meet \u201cwithin the next week.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea fired the ballistic missile from the sea northeast of the city of Wonsan, saying it flew 280 miles and reached an altitude of about 570 miles.\n\nDavid Wright, co-director of the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, noted that the missile was fired with a lofted trajectory.\n\n\u201cIf flown on a standard trajectory with the same payload, that missile would have a maximum range of about 1,900 km (1,200 miles),\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cThis would classify the missile as medium range (1,000 to 3,500 km).\u201d\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that the launch violated U.N. Security Council resolutions, adding, \u201cWe strongly condemn and protest the act.\u201d\n\nThe missile test was a reminder of North Korea\u2019s military capabilities, and an indication that it intends to drive a hard bargain in the talks, experts said. The launch can also be seen as an implicit threat \u2014 that if Pyongyang does not get what it wants in the negotiations, it could ratchet tensions up higher.\n\n[North Korea says it\u2019s willing to hold talks with the U.S. in September \u2014 then launches two more missiles]\n\nSouth Korea said it presumed the missile was a Pukkuksong type. Ankit Panda, a nuclear expert at the Federation of American Scientists, said it was likely to be the Pukkuksong-3, a new submarine-launched ballistic missile that has been under development for a while. In July, Kim Jong Un was seen inspecting a new submarine thought to be capable of firing ballistic missiles.\n\n\u201cIt shows Kim Jong Un is making progress on developing the sea leg of his nuclear forces,\u201d said Panda. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the sea leg isn\u2019t just a vanity project or a prestige project, but they see it as something worth spending resources on, to improve their deterrence in a crisis.\u201d\n\nLee Ho-ryung a researcher at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul, said North Korea has been developing its submarine capacity for a while, so the test was not a surprise.\n\nA \u201csubmarine-launched ballistic missile poses a bigger threat than other short-range missiles North Korea displayed over the past year,\u201d she said. \u201cBy displaying this a day after announcing plans for working-level talks, North Korea is implying that its weapons capacity will continue to be improved while negotiations are stalled.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeople watch a TV at the Seoul Railway Station showing a file image of a North Korean missile launch, on Oct. 2, 2019. (Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images)\n\nPanda said the timing of the launch was probably intended to increase North Korea\u2019s bargaining power in the talks with the United States, as well as to protest South Korea\u2019s display this week of new F-35 stealth fighters obtained from the United States, and Japan\u2019s plans to deploy the Aegis Ashore missile defense system.\n\nNegotiations between U.S. and North Korean diplomats have been frozen since the breakdown of a summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. Another meeting between the two leaders at the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas in June was supposed to lead to a resumption of negotiations, but the stalemate has persisted until now.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea has conducted short-range ballistic missile tests, while complaining bitterly about joint military exercises carried out by the United States and South Korea. On Monday, North Korea blamed the stalling of the dialogue on Washington and Seoul, accusing them of failing to keep their promises.\n\nNorth Korea has also insisted that talks will succeed only if the United States takes a different approach than its tack in Hanoi, but it has been careful not to criticize Trump directly.\n\nIndeed, the North Korean Foreign Ministry also said last week that Trump is \u201cdifferent from his predecessors in political sense and decision\u201d and that it hoped he would make a wise, bold decision.\n\nMin Joo Kim in Seoul and Akiko Kashiwagi in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhile Trump continues to tout North Korea talks as success, signs of any progress are hard to find\n\nNorth Korea tests missile soon after announcing resumption of nuclear talks with U.S.\n\nNorth Korea announces new submarine, sending message to Trump\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The missile appeared to have been launched from the sea and flew 280 miles.", "authors": ["Simon Denyer", "Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan", "North Korea", "South Korea.", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-bYxHNUEZOjIwjXtjbQmT1BRZqs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSMS2KXE4QI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg"}
