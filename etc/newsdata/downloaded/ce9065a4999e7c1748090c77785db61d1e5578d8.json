He appears in documentaries (The Aristocrats) and has documentaries made about him (Gilbert), but he\u2019s never enjoyed the mainstream success found by some of his peers like Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David. While his act carries the rhythm and razzle-dazzle of comics long gone, Gottfried\u2019s tenacity, fearlessness, and dedication to busting taboos make him an unlikely hybrid: A Borscht Belt holdover who regularly sees (and revels in) audience walkouts.\n\nIt makes sense, then, that the joke Gilbert is best known for isn\u2019t one that he wrote \u2014 if you could say anyone \u201cwrote\u201d it in the first place \u2014 the Aristocrats. That\u2019s because of both the way he tells it, which is grosser and more wide-reaching than other comics\u2019 renditions, and when he told it \u2014 at the Hugh Hefner roast, after telling a 9/11 joke soon after the attacks and losing the audience \u201cbigger than anybody has ever lost an audience.\u201d In this episode of Good One, Vulture\u2019s podcast about jokes and the people who tell them, Gilbert discusses all things Aristocrats, from hearing it for the first time to the Hefner roast to bringing it out these days. Download the episode from Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Overcast, or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nBefore it was a thing that you did onstage much later, when you were just doing it for friends, did you have a signature version of the Aristocrats?\n\nThe trick is not to repeat yourself too much. So if you say, \u201cAnd then they bring out a monkey, and it fucks you in the ass.\u201d You got to at least change it to a kangaroo. Or a robot. Doesn\u2019t have to be living.\n\nHad you performed it onstage really before the Hugh Hefner roast?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I wasn\u2019t planning on telling it that night.\n\nFamously, the Hugh Hefner roast took place a few days after September 11th. You were the closer and the first comic to address the attacks. Why did you?\n\nI don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m self-destructive, maybe I\u2019m just plain stupid. But if someone tells me don\u2019t do something, then I want to do it. I\u2019ve always said tragedy and comedy are roommates. Wherever tragedy\u2019s around, comedy\u2019s a few feet behind them sticking his tongue out and making obscene gestures. When you go to a funeral, the guy at the podium will say embarrassing stories about the guy in the box, and people will laugh. People lean over to the person sitting next to them with a smirk on their face, and the other person will hold their hands over their face like, Oh, I shouldn\u2019t be laughing at this.\n\nThe joke that sucked the air out of the room, had you written it beforehand?\n\nYes. I said, \u201cI have to leave early tonight. I have to catch a flight to L.A. I couldn\u2019t get a direct flight. We have to make a stop at the Empire State Building.\u201d And forget it. I lost an audience bigger than anybody has ever lost an audience. People were booing and hissing. One guy yelled out, \u201cToo soon,\u201d which I thought meant I didn\u2019t take a long enough pause between the setup and the punch line.\n\nHad anyone said \u201ctoo soon\u201d before that? Maybe that\u2019s where it started.\n\nThat\u2019s the first time I heard it, and I was quite proud of that. And then I feel like, Well, okay, what makes it soon enough? I could make an argument that I\u2019m more sensitive than people who wait and think it\u2019s okay. You can make a joke about the Titanic, no one\u2019s going to attack you for that. Because you\u2019re a sensitive person, you waited all those years? You\u2019re saying, Fuck everybody who died on the Titanic, that\u2019s years ago. Even their grandkids are dead, and fuck their grandkids. I\u2019m a sensitive person. With me, you could make the argument that when I saw it and it\u2019s too soon, everyone goes, \u201cOh, my God, how could he do that? It\u2019s such a horrible thing.\u201d It\u2019s acknowledging it\u2019s a horrible thing.\n\nHow much do you remember about losing the room that day?\n\nOh my God, I was floating through outer space. Getting back to the Titanic, I felt like Leonardo DiCaprio when he loses grip of that door at the end, and he\u2019s going into the bottom of the frozen ocean. When I was up there, it was like, Well, I\u2019m at the bottom level of hell, and this show seems pretty much over. And then that popped into my head, because I figured, Why not go to an even lower level of hell?\n\nHow quickly did the audience turn around?\n\nImmediately. The comics were laughing, and the audience was going wild. Just the biggest laughs I ever heard.\n\nYou got a lot of positive response from this. Did anyone who saw it ever come up to you?\n\nI was backstage at The Tonight Show and somebody called out my name. I turned around and it was Harrison Ford. He complimented me on my telling of the Aristocrats joke and how much it made him laugh. This is one of those stories that I cringe at every time I think of it. It\u2019s like anytime I\u2019ve tried to ask a girl out, I remember every fucking word I said, and go, \u201cOh, why did you say that?\u201d That\u2019s my whole life. So instead of the right thing to do, which would\u2019ve been, \u201cOh, thank you. I love Blade Runner.\u201d That would\u2019ve been fine, and he would\u2019ve been flattered, and I could\u2019ve walked away like a human being. But I think, Oh, I gotta be funny now. I said, \u201cOh, thank you, and your name is \u2026 ?\u201d I don\u2019t know if he caught that it was a joke, but either way, he walked away going, \u201cBoy, Gilbert Gottfried\u2019s an asshole.\u201d\n\nDo you have any other memorable stories about times you did the Aristocrat?\n\nThere was a club in Rochester that by law had to have a deaf interpreter onstage. I don\u2019t do the Aristocrats that much, but I thought, Holy shit, to be able to do the Aristocrats and be that gross, that disgusting, and that perverted, and have this woman act it out? Holy Christ, I have to. I immediately walked over to the deaf interpreter and said, \u201cThis family walks\u2026 \u201d By then, the audience went out of their minds, because they knew what was going to happen. I\u2019m watching the woman as I\u2019m saying, \u201cAnd the son blows his father, and then the dog is fucking the mother.\u201d She acted out all of it, and I\u2019ve got to say, I admired her greatly.", "description": "On this week\u2019s Good One, Gilbert Gottfried discusses performing the infamous Aristocrats joke at the roast of Hugh Hefner and how he turned to it after telling a September 11th joke \u201ctoo soon.\u201d", "authors": ["Jesse David Fox"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/05/05-gilbert-gotfried-good-one-podcast.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
