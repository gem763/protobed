MLB umpire\u2019s pro-Trump tweets under investigation", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s World Series time and while we wait to see if the Houston Astros bounce back or if the Washington Nationals sweep the series, politics has reared its ugly head. In an unusual turn of events, a Major League Baseball (MLB) umpire is under investigation for tweeting support for President Trump.\n\nRob Drake is a 50-year-old full-time MLB umpire and he has some strong opinions about impeachment. On Tuesday he tweeted about his concerns about a potential upcoming civil war in America if President Trump is impeached. He\u2019s triggered the anti-gun mob by declaring he will purchase a semi-automatic rifle ahead of time.\n\n\u201cI will be buying an AR-15 tomorrow, because if you impeach MY PRESIDENT this way, YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER CIVAL [sic] WAR!!! #MAGA2020\u201d is what he tweeted. That tweet has been deleted and his Twitter account has been deactivated. Earlier Tuesday he tweeted out his frustration with the impeachment process underway in the House at the hands of Democrats.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Drake reacted to the Democratic-led House closed-door impeachment proceedings in an initial tweet writing: \u201cYou can\u2019t do an impeachment inquiry from the basement of Capital [sic] Hill without even a vote! What is going on in this country?\u201d \u201cWe have a political party trying to overthrow a president by lying, hiding, creating and manufacturing crimes. Where do we live? This is the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! This isn\u2019t Russia, Venezuela, Cuba,\u201d Drake also wrote, according to separate unverified screenshots of his account activity posted by a Twitter user. The screenshots also showed that Drake retweeted messages promoting the far-right conspiracy theory QAnon.\n\nClearly, Drake is a Trump supporter. Supporting the president is his right but things get tricky on social media. He added to the fire by including his intention of purchasing a weapon and QAnon. Speaking to the press before Game 2 in Houston, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said an investigation is ongoing. Drake isn\u2019t working the post-season games this year.\n\nMajor league umpire Rob Drake tweeted \u201cI will be buying an AR-15 tomorrow, because if you impeach MY PRESIDENT this way, YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER CIVAL WAR!!! #MAGA2020\u201d, according to a copy of the tweet obtained by ESPN. MLB says it is aware of it. News: https://t.co/Qf7VMAXEoJ \u2014 Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) October 23, 2019\n\nThe president of the MLB hasn\u2019t commented.\n\nJoe West, the president of the Major League Baseball Umpires Association, declined comment when reached by phone. Drake, 50, made his major league debut in 1999 and has been a full-time major league umpire since 2010. He worked postseason games in 2010 and 2012 through \u201915, and was on the crew at the All-Star Game in 2013.\n\nThere are ten prohibitions listed in the official MLB social media policy. Reading through the list, it seems the only rule Drake\u2019s tweets would violate has to do with \u201cthreat of violence\u201d, though I\u2019d argue that Drake didn\u2019t make a specific threat. His tweet was more about self-protection, which is why people purchase guns. Take a look at the list:\n\nPlayers can\u2019t make what can be construed as official club or league statements without permission;\n\nPlayers can\u2019t use copyrighted team logos and stuff without permission or tweet confidential or private information about teams or players, their families, etc.;\n\nPlayers can\u2019t link to any MLB website or platform from social media without permission;\n\nNo tweets condoning or appearing to condone the use of substances on the MLB banned drug list (which is everything but booze, right?);\n\nNo ripping umpires or questioning their integrity;\n\nNo racial, sexist, homophobic, anti-religious, etc. etc. content;\n\nNo harassment or threats of violence;\n\nNothing sexually explicit;\n\nNothing otherwise illegal.\n\nThat is all pretty basic stuff, right? There isn\u2019t anything about inserting personal political opinions into a Twitter timeline. If we use the guideline above, Drake should be in the clear unless the main problem comes from the AR-15 reference. He didn\u2019t tweet any threats, though. I\u2019m assuming he doesn\u2019t even own one if he\u2019s tweeting about going to buy one if Trump\u2019s impeached. I guess we\u2019ll find out if the MLB organization caves to the delicate gun-grabbers who are triggered by the mere mention of a weapon. The leftists are already describing Drake\u2019s tweets as a call for violence.\n\nI enjoyed this tweet, which lightheartedly mocks all the idiocy of today\u2019s hyper-polarized political atmosphere:\n\n30% chance he's the next Sec. Defense. https://t.co/f5JSJjixZE \u2014 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) October 24, 2019\n\nTo be perfectly clear, I don\u2019t want politics to seep into sports. I love watching my Houston Astros and the team is loved in Houston. The team won its first ever World Series just two months after Houston was devastated by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and the lift to everyone\u2019s morale provided by that win will never be forgotten. I know I\u2019ll never forget it. I don\u2019t even want to know the political opinions of the umpires working the games. I just want them to call balls and strikes. That\u2019s their job. Though I think I have watched at least some of every televised game of the Astros this season, I couldn\u2019t tell you the name of any of the umpires.\n\nI\u2019ll end with a little video clip of superstar Olympic gymnast, Houstonian Simone Biles throwing out the first pitch Tuesday night. The Astro player who receives the pitch is Jake Marisnick.", "description": "A semi-automatic rifle may be involved.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6dde5d1a-e47a-4b22-a9af-bb2b2b80bbc2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
