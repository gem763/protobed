She became the first woman justice of the Supreme Court in October 2009, and was appointed deputy president in June 2013.\n\nAccording to 2018 Ministry of Justice figures, just 29% of court judges are currently women.\n\nWhat's Twitter saying?\n\nSome decided to focus on her fashion game.\n\nAfter a busy few days in court, others predicted she would be channelling Phoebe Waller-Bridge's post Emmy Awards mood.\n\nThis tweeter hopes Lady Hale will inspire a generation of judges.\n\nOthers promoted her to super-hero status.\n\nAnd some were mesmerised by the two pairs of scissors she keeps on her desk.\n\nNow if you don't mind we're off to look up where to buy spider brooches online.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "From Fleabag memes to brooch fashion - all the ways social media responded to Lady Hale.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1482D/production/_108931048_ladyhalecomnp976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
