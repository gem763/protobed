The America that they believed in was under attack, not from without, but from within.\n\nThese men and women, of all political persuasions, have seen the assaults on our institutions: on the intelligence and law enforcement community, the State Department and the press. They have seen our leaders stand beside despots and strongmen, preferring their government narrative to our own. They have seen us abandon our allies and have heard the shouts of betrayal from the battlefield. As I stood on the parade field at Fort Bragg, one retired four-star general, grabbed my arm, shook me and shouted, \u201cI don\u2019t like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!\u201d\n\nThose words echoed with me throughout the week. It is easy to destroy an organization if you have no appreciation for what makes that organization great. We are not the most powerful nation in the world because of our aircraft carriers, our economy, or our seat at the United Nations Security Council. We are the most powerful nation in the world because we try to be the good guys. We are the most powerful nation in the world because our ideals of universal freedom and equality have been backed up by our belief that we were champions of justice, the protectors of the less fortunate.\n\nBut, if we don\u2019t care about our values, if we don\u2019t care about duty and honor, if we don\u2019t help the weak and stand up against oppression and injustice \u2014 what will happen to the Kurds, the Iraqis, the Afghans, the Syrians, the Rohingyas, the South Sudanese and the millions of people under the boot of tyranny or left abandoned by their failing states?\n\nIf our promises are meaningless, how will our allies ever trust us? If we can\u2019t have faith in our nation\u2019s principles, why would the men and women of this nation join the military? And if they don\u2019t join, who will protect us? If we are not the champions of the good and the right, then who will follow us? And if no one follows us \u2014 where will the world end up?\n\nPresident Trump seems to believe that these qualities are unimportant or show weakness. He is wrong. These are the virtues that have sustained this nation for the past 243 years. If we hope to continue to lead the world and inspire a new generation of young men and women to our cause, then we must embrace these values now more than ever.\n\nAnd if this president doesn\u2019t understand their importance, if this president doesn\u2019t demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office \u2014 Republican, Democrat or independent \u2014 the sooner, the better. The fate of our Republic depends upon it.\n\nWilliam H.
