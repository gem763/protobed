Executives of the shared-office-space provider and investment bankers advising the deal expect We\u2019s valuation to drop to as little as one-third of its last private-market valuation of $47 billion or possibly lower, The Wall Street Journal reported. Last week, the company postponed its IPO, which is now expected after mid-October at the earliest.\n\nSoftBank and the Vision Fund own nearly one-third of We, reflecting the company\u2019s strategy of making big bets. Any valuation below about $25 billion for the company would force SoftBank to reduce the value of its investment in it, according to an estimate by analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.\n\nHow the company values We and its other struggling investments at the end of the quarter will be a test of its credibility. If We were public, the number would be clear. Since it probably won\u2019t be, the fund will have some discretion putting a price on its stake, though investors would be skeptical about any valuation near $47 billion.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Where do you see SoftBank in the coming months? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe downturn highlights the risks SoftBank has piled up: The fund effectively borrowed money to make risky investments; it raised and spent its cash in record time, deep into the longest bull market in history; and it took huge stakes in unprofitable companies, making it hard to unload them if their businesses or the market turn down.\n\nThose decisions made the fund a kingmaker, allowing it to anoint companies including We, Uber Technologies Inc. and its Chinese rival Didi Chuxing Technology Co. as industry leaders by writing them huge checks. Until recently, that strategy paid off, with the fund reporting a annualized return of 29% since its inception in 2017 through the end of March. But what made the fund soar in a bull market is pulling it down during a weak one.\n\nThe disappointment of We follows the weak IPO of Uber, whose shares are down 28% from their offering price, and Slack Technologies Inc., whose stock tumbled more than 30% since the end of the latest quarter when SoftBank last had to value the Vision Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nEven shares of cancer-test company Guardant Health Inc., which nearly quadrupled from their IPO price, are now trading below where they were at the end of June, potentially requiring them to be marked down.\n\nBy financing much of its assets with what is essentially debt, the Vision Fund has increased its risk. Roughly 40% of the Vision Fund\u2019s capital\u2014$40 billion\u2014is in the form of preferred stock, which promises a return of 7% a year, just like debt. It is unusual for a fund to include preferred shares. SoftBank has retained proceeds from asset sales to ensure it can pay the coupon.\n\nThe lure of regular payouts allowed the fund to raise money at a faster pace and in bigger chunks than any fund before it. It attracted Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund and Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala Investment Co., which contributed more than half of the fund\u2019s nearly $100 billion in capital.\n\nThat structure meant that holders of the fund\u2019s roughly $60 billion in common equity\u2014SoftBank and its employees have roughly half of that\u2014get big returns on the way up, but the potential for big losses on the way down.\n\nThe We Co.\u2019s rapid expansion and flexible business model have helped it stay out in front of competitors. But some investors are saying its public offering might not be worth the risk. Here\u2019s why.

And since owners of preferred stock are first in line when the fund cashes out of its holdings, any gains from investments go toward paying that $40 billion before equity holders get any. After all those payouts, the fund would need to generate around $12 billion in cash every year to produce a 20% return, an analysis by the Journal showed.\n\nAs of June 30, the fund had earned $6.4 billion in realized gains since its inception. Of that, $2.5 billion went to pay back investors and $1.6 billion went to make coupon payments on the preferred stock, according to a company presentation and Journal calculations.\n\nAlready, some of SoftBank\u2019s plans for extracting cash to pay the Vision Fund\u2019s investors are starting to look overly optimistic. SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son \u2014the mastermind behind the fund\u2014said he is counting on five or six IPOs from its portfolio during the fiscal year ending March 2020, and another 10 the following year. But many of the Vision Fund\u2019s companies are still burning through cash and losing money, something that the public markets may not view favorably, as We\u2019s attempt to list has shown.\n\nThe fund can borrow more if it needs to generate cash quickly. In August, it said it had secured an unusual three-year loan facility, backed by its shares in Uber and Guardant. The loan lets it borrow up to $4 billion to return cash to its investors. Having some form of leverage isn\u2019t unusual for a large fund, but it isn\u2019t common practice to use stakes in public companies as collateral on loans.\n\nRisky Borrowing SoftBank's Vision Fund is unusual because its capital is a mix of equity and debt-like preferred equity. This makes the fund risky because it must make regular payments even though its investments are volatile. Most funds like it only raise equity.

Instead, in the 11th year of the longest bull market in history, the fund said it has invested close to $85 billion of the nearly $100 billion it raised in 2017. Three of those investments\u2014Uber, We and Didi\u2014account for nearly 30% of the Vision Fund\u2019s portfolio by value, estimates research firm Astris Advisory.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s $33 billion stake in the fund, which accounts for more than half of the equity in the fund, also relies on borrowed money. SoftBank itself has more than $160 billion in debt, and the company extended about $8 billion in loans to Vision Fund employees to invest in the fund, the Journal reported.\n\nThere is new urgency to the success of the Vision Fund. SoftBank is raising money for a second fund, and says it has expressions of interest totaling $108 billion. So far the only confirmed commitment is from SoftBank, which will invest $38 billion and lend up to $20 billion to the fund\u2019s employees for their investments, the Journal reported.\n\nSoftBank also is counting on cash generated by the first fund to cover its investment in the second Vision Fund. To do that, the first Vision Fund would have to generate $9.5 billion a year for SoftBank for four years\u2014on top of the money needed to pay returns on the preferred shares, estimates analyst David Gibson at Astris.\n\nThat could be difficult since the fund\u2019s returns will likely be lumpy and the bulk of cash distributions may come years from now. SoftBank also could sell assets, such as a portion of its $120 billion stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , to fund its investment.\n\nInvestors have grown skeptical of SoftBank\u2019s ability to handle this balancing act. The company\u2019s shares are down nearly 25% from their recent peak in April.\n\nWrite to Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com and Phred Dvorak at phred.dvorak@wsj.com", "description": "Investors\u2019 sudden skepticism toward pricey, profitless tech companies is threatening SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund, which may take a hit on some of its biggest investments, including WeWork\u2019s parent.", "authors": ["Miriam Gottfried", "Phred Dvorak", "Miriam.Gottfried Wsj.Com", "Phred.Dvorak Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108871/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
