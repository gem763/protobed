Noel Quinn, who recently became interim chief executive, plans to cut up to 10,000 jobs in an attempt to remove costs and bureaucracy. The change of tone is striking.\n\nPredecessor John Flint was ousted partly for his stance that job cuts were not needed to contain costs.\n\nHSBC has made a step in the right direction. But Mr Quinn needs to be far more aggressive.\n\nHigher-paid senior staff in Europe are expected to be most affected by layoffs. HSBC is reducing its exposure to Brexit and to negative interest rates. The bank is selling a retail operation in France.\n\nConsidering the bank\u2019s global headcount, the figure of 10,000 seems small. It amounts to just 4 per cent of HSBC\u2019s headcount of roughly 238,000. Even with cuts centred on senior staff, that might mean a reduction of less than a tenth of the bank\u2019s wage costs.\n\nMore layoffs should be focused on the global banking and markets division. Revenues here have lagged and are down in the first half, contributing to a miss in HSBC\u2019s return on tangible equity target of 6 per cent in the US.", "description": "Considering the bank\u2019s global headcount, the figure of 10,000 seems small.
