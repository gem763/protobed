And in recent days, Mr. Giuliani reached out through intermediaries to request a meeting with Mr. Zelensky, he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not confirmed yet.\u201d\n\nIf the meeting does occur, Mr. Giuliani said, \u201cI am going to tell him what I know about the people that are surrounding him, and how important it is to do a full, complete and fair investigation.\u201d\n\nHe said his efforts in Ukraine have the full support of Mr. Trump. He declined to say specifically whether he had briefed him on the planned meeting with Mr. Zelensky, but added, \u201cHe basically knows what I\u2019m doing, sure, as his lawyer.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n\nMr. Trump has called attention to the scrutiny of Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, and to questions about the former vice president\u2019s involvement in the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor whose office had authority over investigations of the oligarch whose company paid Hunter Biden.\n\nMr. Trump has also sought to stir up interest in claims that Ukrainian officials tried to benefit Hillary Clinton in 2016 by focusing attention on Mr. Manafort\u2019s business in Ukraine. The attention forced Mr. Manafort to resign from the Trump campaign, but allies of the Ukrainian officials involved have denied that they acted improperly to benefit Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Trump has recently suggested he would like Attorney General William P. Barr to look into the material gathered by the Ukrainian prosecutors.\n\nMr. Giuliani has been working on the effort with other allies of Mr. Trump whose involvement has not been previously reported, including Victoria Toensing, a lawyer who was named last year, along with her husband, as part of the legal team representing the president in the special counsel\u2019s investigation. The appointment was rescinded less than one week later amid concerns about conflicts of interest, but Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team suggested that Ms. Toensing and her husband, Joseph E. diGenova, would assist the president \u201cin other legal matters.\u201d\n\nOn social media and in regular appearances on Fox News, the couple advanced the theory that the special counsel\u2019s investigation was the result of a Justice Department effort to frame Mr. Trump. They increasingly began pushing the claim that \u201cthe real collusion began in @Ukraine,\u201d as Ms. Toensing put it in a post on Twitter in March.", "description": "The president\u2019s personal lawyer is stepping up efforts to urge the Ukrainian government to wade into United States politics by pursuing investigations that touch on Joe Biden and Paul Manafort.", "authors": ["Kenneth P.
