It was spotted by an auctioneer, who advised its owner to have it evaluated by experts.\n\nThe owner believed it to be an old religious icon with little value.\n\nTests were carried out on the artwork using infrared light to determine the similarities with works by the Italian painter Cimabue, also known as Cenni di Pepo.\n\nBorn in the city of Florence, he was active in the late 13th and early 14th Centuries - a transitional figure between the stylised art of the medieval period and the more naturalistic works of the Renaissance.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Artist JR and volunteers paper around the Louvre Museum's glass pyramid in Paris\n\nThe artwork is tiny; measuring just 20 by 26cm (8in by 10in).\n\nIt is believed to be part of a polyptych - a larger work of painted scenes divided into several panels - dating from 1280, depicting Christ's passion and crucifixion.\n\nTwo other scenes from the same Cimabue series can be seen at London's National Gallery, and the Frick Collection in New York.\n\nCimabue's work was largely influenced by Byzantine art, produced on poplar wood panels with backgrounds of gold paint.", "description": "The painting was found hanging above a hotplate in an elderly woman's home in northern France.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1452A/production/_108924238_hi056744531.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
