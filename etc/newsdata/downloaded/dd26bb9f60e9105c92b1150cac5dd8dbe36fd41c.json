This is where nearly four hours of a game that had its moments but otherwise told of a sport staggering under the weight of its new brain becomes the best of itself again in the ninth minute after four hours.\n\nIt\u2019s too long, it\u2019s too tedious, nobody knows what the ball is doing anymore and the geniuses are getting in the way of the baseball, and then the New York Yankees and Astros stage a ninth inning like that, when DJ LeMahieu homers for two runs off the Astros\u2019 closer to tie the score, when Jose Altuve homers for two off the Yankees\u2019 closer to trigger the confetti, and the American League Championship Series exhausts itself and the beer supply.\n\nThe moral, then, is that the heartbeat still exists in there somewhere, in the drama that builds and the bat barrel that flashes and the hanging slider that gets exactly what it deserves. Then, too, in the hugs and laughter on the field and the hugs and tears in the locker room across the way, the way seasons continue and end simultaneously, in the same way the game infuriates and inspires.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d LeMahieu said, \u201cI thought it was going to be our night.\u201d\n\nMore, their year.\n\nJose Altuve celebrates with Justin Verlander after hitting a two-run walk-off home run to win the ALCS and advance the Houston Astros to the World Series. (Alex Trautwig/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s failure,\u201d Aaron Judge said.\n\nThe Yankees haven\u2019t won at the end in a decade. So Aroldis Chapman, having minutes before watched Astros right-hander Roberto Osuna allow the home run that appeared to change everything, threw the last pitch of the series and at the third-base line nearly bumped into Altuve frolicking past.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Chapman said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I couldn\u2019t believe it. He hit that ball well. For that split second, I just couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what saves it all, too, those times when nobody can quite believe it, when the perfect moment leaps from the dingiest shadow and cuts a whole city off at the knees.\n\n\u201cI hit the ball,\u201d Altuve recounted, \u201cyou make sure the ball is gone before you celebrate.\u201d\n\nThe ball struck a concrete pillar above the yellow line in left-center field and bounded across the outfield, a jolt of a home run that put the Yankees back on a plane for New York the day after they arrived.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019m thinking, \u2018We\u2019re going to the World Series,\u2019\u201d Altuve said. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m thinking -- I don\u2019t know. A lot of things.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d hit .348 in the ALCS and become its Most Valuable Player, which, at times, is redundant around here.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the heart and soul of the Houston Astros,\u201d said Jeff Luhnow, the club\u2019s president of baseball operations.\n\nSaid A.J. Hinch, their manager: \u201cI\u2019m so proud of him. I\u2019m so fortunate to be his manager.\u201d\n\nGoing on five hours earlier, Hinch had sat in the same chair, mulling the coming baseball game.\n\n\u201cWelcome to 2019,\u201d he said, and you can\u2019t make me go.\n\nIn Game 6 of the ALCS here, neither the Astros nor Yankees, whose combined payrolls is close to $375 million, could field a true starting pitcher. From among 50 men.\n\nThis was not a Game 6 problem. This is a baseball problem that snaked its way into Game 6.\n\nThe Astros are going to the World Series. A baseball game was played and somebody won and this is the deserved result of that. Their job is not to defend how they won, just to win, and that\u2019s fine. The Astros were the class of the American League, they will play the Washington Nationals come Tuesday night, and this is the way it should be, if not necessarily how it should be. The score they danced to and showered themselves with was 6-4. They\u2019d played the game presented to them, got most of the important hits, then the very most important hit, made brilliant defensive plays in the sixth, seventh and eighth innings with runners on base, and found that their seven pitchers over nine innings were slightly better than the Yankees\u2019 seven over nine.\n\nSo on a football Saturday, with baseball endeavoring to identify and connect with its next generation of live-stream viewers and cap buyers, what it presented on Oct. 19, its most important game to date, was the two best teams in the American League and an interminable parade of who\u2019s-that middle relievers, followed by two closers.\n\nAroldis Chapman allowed a walk-off home run to Jose Altuve in ALCS Game 6. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nThe Astros and Yankees, hardball royalty, picked a funny time to hold pitcher tryouts.\n\nHinch and Yankees manager Aaron Boone spent as much time on the mound as any of their pitchers, mostly waiting on the next pitcher to arrive.\n\nThey were, perhaps, victims of circumstance, including a league-wide shortage of pitching. More specific to them, there\u2019d been injuries and ineffectiveness and rain in the Bronx and, in the case of the Yankees, a disciplinary proceeding. The game will find you, they like to say, and on the evening of Game 6 in front of a packed Minute Maid Park, the game found two franchises who\u2019d put forth a decent first five games of the series and otherwise run out of starting pitching.\n\nSo, not Jack Morris against John Smoltz, from all those World Series ago. Not David Price against Justin Verlander, which is how last season ended for the Astros on this very field. Not even Gerrit Cole against Luis Severino, which was scheduled for Game 7 here.\n\nNone of those. Instead, Chad Green against Brad Peacock, two fine gentlemen and professional pitchers whose roles in an elimination ALCS game might best be left to emergency status. The game slogged past them and deep into the bullpens, into starters who\u2019d been pared from their postseason rotations, into matchups born from intricate preparation, then finally, finally, finally to the men hired and paid to protect leads at the end, to the place in the game that would breathe and bleed and swoon. They both failed, because two batters would not, and that is precisely and perfectly what the game can be, if you stick around long enough. Maybe the game doesn\u2019t need saving, exactly. But it\u2019s good to be reminded of when it can be bad and when it can be great, even if it takes some time to get there. Bring plenty of beer.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Maybe the game doesn\u2019t need saving, exactly.
