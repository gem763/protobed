Experts from the European Commission have been brought into discussions since Sunday to try to resolve the issue and Barnier said a \"narrow path\" to a deal was still open.\n\nHowever, he added that only one day remained for the two sides to agree a new version of the text if a deal is to be signed off by leaders at the European Council summit on Thursday, the diplomats said.\n\n\u201cEven if the agreement will be difficult, more and more difficult, to be frank, it is still possible this week,\u201d Barnier told reporters as he arrived at Tuesday's meeting of EU ministers in Luxembourg to debrief them on the intensive Brexit talks launched at the end of last week.\n\n\u201cObviously, any agreement must work for everyone, the whole of the United Kingdom, and the whole of the European Union ... it is high time to turn good intention in a legal text,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe always have shown a great deal of flexibility, but that hasn't led to the necessary changes in London unfortunately\u201d \u2014 Michael Roth, German EU minister\n\nLuxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn echoed Barnier's more positive tone. \u201cThey will try to reach a deal by this evening, if not possible it\u2019s likely there will be another summit. There is some optimism,\u201d he said.\n\nU.K. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay made an unexpected visit to the meeting in Luxembourg. \u201cThe talks are ongoing. We need to give them space to proceed. But detailed conversations are under way and a deal is still very possible,\u201d he said.\n\nOne EU diplomat said it\u2019s possible there will be a new legal text Wednesday when EU27 ambassadors will meet to scrutinize it ahead of the gathering of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday. This text must provide a feasible solution for the key problem of how to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the diplomats say.\n\nThe new talks started to show signs of progress last Thursday after a meeting between U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar, leading Barnier to announce Friday the resumption of serious talks.\n\nHowever, ministers arriving at the General Affairs Council were skeptical.\n\n\u201cWe always have shown a great deal of flexibility, but that hasn't led to the necessary changes in London unfortunately,\u201d said German EU minister Michael Roth. \u201cI won't bet any money on a Brexit happening this week, but I will wait for Mr Barnier's presentation,\u201d said Malta's EU minister Edward Zammit Lewis.\n\nThe two sides are exchanging draft texts, said another EU diplomat, but Brexit officials say they have not been informed of any new text presented by London. Another diplomat said the U.K. is expected to come back with a new draft for discussion Tuesday, though diplomats caution that a breakthrough doesn\u2019t seem likely anytime soon.\n\nIn light of skepticism that a deal can be agreed in time, discussions are also focused on possible extensions to negotiations. Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, the French EU minister, repeated the French position that \u201cif a major political change was to intervene in the U.K, that could be the justification for an extension discussion if that was asked. A major political change would be new elections, a referendum, something that would change the political dynamic.\u201d\n\nDiplomats say an extension seems very hard to avoid as some think it will take at least a month to reach a deal. Much depends on how close the agreed solution is to the original EU plan, put forward in February 2018. Under that proposal, Northern Ireland would effectively stay in the EU\u2019s single market and customs union after Brexit as part of a \u201cbackstop\u201d provision for the Irish border, a mechanism designed to ensure that there is never a hard border on the island of Ireland whatever happens in future trade talks.\n\nThe latest discussions were triggered after the U.K agreed to re-start talks using the February 2018 proposal as a starting point. The closer the final agreement is to that solution, the quicker it would be for the EU to reach a deal, one of the diplomats said.\n\nBarnier told ministers there are now three possible scenarios: deadlock, further negotiations or an agreement on a legal text by Tuesday evening, something that he described as difficult but possible, said the diplomat in the room.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
