He also knocked in a run with a ground-out in the ninth.\n\nTorres, who is from Venezuela, became the youngest American League player ever with a five-RBI post-season game. After the game, he told reporters that \u201cI believe in what I can do. I do my job.\u201d\n\nHe said the \u201cmost important thing for me is to stay humble.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees\u2019 other runs came on a 406-foot Giancarlo Stanton home run in the sixth and a Gio Urshela homer in the ninth. New York had 13 hits on the night.\n\nThe Yankees moved up Torres in the lineup to bat third Saturday, seeking to take advantage of his hot bat in the American League Division Series against the Minnesota Twins that New York won three games to none.\n\nTorres had hit a go-ahead two-run double in the fifth inning in Game 1 of division series against the Twins and hit a solo homer and doubled two times in Game 3.\n\nWhen the Yankees announced their roster Saturday afternoon for the American League Championship Series, outfielder Aaron Hicks, who had a right flexor strain, and left-handed pitcher CC Sabathia were listed as active.\n\nSabathia had been shut down in September after he complained of shoulder discomfort. He has announced he plans to retire after this season.\n\nThe Yankees dropped first baseman Luke Voit and infielder-outfielder Tyler Wade from the 25-man roster. Voit and Wade did not play in any of the three games against Minnesota.\n\nThe Yankees and Astros will meet for Game 2 of the championship series Sunday at 8:08 p.m. EDT at Houston\u2019s Minute Maid Park.", "description": "Oct. 12 (UPI) \u2014 Gleyber Torres knocked in five runs and Masahiro Tanaka allowed just one hit in six innings as the New York Yankees shut out the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
