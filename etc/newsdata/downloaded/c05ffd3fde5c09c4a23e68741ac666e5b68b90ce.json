He was making a clear reference to President Gerald Ford pardoning President Richard Nixon once Nixon was impeached. The pardon kept Nixon from being prosecuted for his role in the Watergate scandal.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t unite the country,\u201d Biden said about a potential pardon. \u201cYou\u2019d say: \u2018Wait a minute. I get a parking ticket and I\u2019ve got to pay it. This happens to me and I\u2019ve got to go to jail. This guy does all these things that put us jeopardy and he gets off?\"\n\n\"And I think President Ford, God love him he\u2019s a good guy, I knew him pretty well, I think if he had to do it over again he wouldn\u2019t have done it\u2026because he didn\u2019t get re-elected,\" the former vice president said.\n\nAccording to Biden, President Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate both Joe and Hunter Biden for corrupt behavior has had no impact on the Democratic presidential race. Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry over the call, even though the transcript showed no pro quid pro took place.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows he\u2019s a liar \u2014 the president \u2014 I mean, for real,\u201d he explained. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m the reason he\u2019s being impeached. He\u2019s indicted himself by calling in foreign powers to try to impact the election.\u201d\n\nDuring a news conference on Sunday, Biden reiterated his position that Hunter did nothing wrong by sitting on the board of directors of a Ukrainian gas company, even though his father was handling international relations with Ukraine on behalf of the Obama administration. Hunter was being paid $50,000 a month for his work, despite having no natural energy experience.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m not going to let you all do is take the focus off the problem,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNo one, no one has asserted my son did anything done. No one has asserted that I have done anything wrong except a lying president.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Hunter finally spoke out about the ordeal when he released a statement saying he was stepping down from the board of BKR, a Chinese private equity firm. He also vowed not to have any foreign business dealings should his father win the presidency.", "description": "Geez..10/14/2019 22:15:23PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/ea372bfa-9ed3-4293-a51a-fa1712a12657.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
