Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D).\n\nWhile Biden fared the best in a hypothetical general election matchup in the Republican-leaning swing state, Trump still led the former vice president with 38.4 percent to Biden\u2019s 34.6 percent.\n\nThe others are as follows:\n\nTrump: 39.1 percent\n\nWarren: 33 percent Trump: 38.8 percent\n\nSanders: 32.5 percent Trump 39.1 percent\n\nHarris 28.4 percent Trump: 39 percent\n\nButtigieg: 27 percent\n\nOne of the most significant narratives moving into the 2020 election is the state of the economy, which Trump has touted as one of his greatest accomplishments.
