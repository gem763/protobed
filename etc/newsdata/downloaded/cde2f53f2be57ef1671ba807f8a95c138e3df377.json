Photo: Getty Images\n\nNew York\u2019s hottest backstage was Marc Jacobs spring 2020. It had everything: FKA Twigs\u2013inspired baby hairs, high pigtails, bowl-cut wigs, corkscrew curls, and purposely chipped nail polish. Faces had rhinestones, cellophane, teal face paint, orange eye shadow, red eye shadow, or just a smoky eye inspired by Jane Fonda in Klute. And that list only covers about 6 percent of what was in attendance, because the show had 60 models and each one got a unique, personality-driven hairstyle, makeup look, and manicure.\n\n\u201cFor Marc and me, it was an idealized interpretation of real life,\u201d Pat McGrath, the lead makeup artist, said backstage. \u201cI would call it a modern take on street style \u2014 street style in the most maximum way. Not one girl or boy or person could look the same. Every single one had to be different.\u201d And they truly were. Instead of uniform face charts diagramming \u201cthe look,\u201d each models\u2019 face was posted on a wall with meticulous notes underneath: \u201cturquoise paint splatter inner corner matching glitter\u201d (Shanelle Nyasiase), \u201cice blue pencil top and bottom mascara\u201d (Gigi Hadid), \u201cpretty but masculine\u201d (Binx Walton), and \u201csupermodel gorgeous beauty\u201d (Bella Hadid).\n\nFrom left: Red glitter eyes Photo: SlavenVlasic/Getty Images for Marc Jacobs Jacobs\u2019s rendition of Jane Fonda in Klute.

Some from another era, some from today, a mix of everything Marc likes, really,\u201d said Redken\u2019s Guido Palau, who was in charge of dreaming up the 60 hairstyles. By that measure, Jacobs likes a lot of hat-ready hair, the occasional haircut, double puff buns, a Shelley Duvall shag, an Andy Warhol shag, intricate braids, and proudly bad \u201980s perms interpreted with some humor through a modern lens. \u201cEven when it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s right. You have to do it in your way to make it you. Everything goes now,\u201d Palau added.\n\nThis reflection of real-life imperfection also shone through the nail looks overseen by Jin Soon. Styles were named after looks we\u2019re all familiar with: Chipped, Super Chipped (\u201cWhen you leave your polish on for almost two months and the leftover polish sticks in the center of the nail\u201d), and Boy Brushed, where two nails (often the pinky finger and ring) were painted haphazardly like an unpracticed boy might do it (so, not you, Harry Styles). There was also the chaotic \u201cRandom\u201d (exactly what it sounds like) and more intricate nail art created by Mei Kawajiri.\n\nFrom left: Glitter cheeks Photo: Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Masquerade eyes.

Palau relied heavily on Redken\u2019s Triple Pure 32 Neutral Fragrance Hairspray for maximum hold. All models\u2019 faces were prepped with Marc Jacobs Beauty Youthquake Gel Cr\u00e8me Moisturizer, and many of the eye looks got their pop from Marc Jacobs Beauty Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner in the Buff, Peridot, and Whirlpool. Meanwhile, Soon relied on different combos of Marc Jacobs Enamored Hi-Shine Nail Polish, including Jane (a beige for the natural looks) and Midnight in Paris (a deep navy for the chipped ones).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nod to the real word, the way nowadays everybody loves to play with makeup,\u201d said McGrath. \u201cSome people love truly eccentric looks, and some people love the art of natural-looking makeup. It\u2019s really about the characters, everyone being different and having fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ultimate is individuality and expression of who you are, and that can be anything. It\u2019s a more inclusive message of beauty,\u201d Palau echoed backstage, where there truly was something for everyone. I can\u2019t tell you how to get each look, but I can tell you that literally whatever you\u2019re doing right now \u2014 on top of your head, on your face, or all over your nails \u2014 is definitely on trend for spring 2020.\n\nFrom left: Gigi Hadid in icy blue liner Photo: SlavenVlasic/Getty Images for Marc Jacobs Pearl eyes.
