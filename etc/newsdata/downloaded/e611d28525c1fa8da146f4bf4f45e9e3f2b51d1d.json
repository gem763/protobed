Nor does the whistleblower statute cover a president\u2019s dealings with a foreign nation.\n\nThe Constitution gives presidents virtual carte blanche to conduct US foreign policy. That\u2019s something that frustrated critics of President Barack Obama\u2019s secret dealings with Iran that led to a scandalously weak nuclear deal.\n\nAs much as the Democratic-controlled House has the right to conduct oversight over the executive branch, demanding the transcripts of private conversations with foreign leaders would make it impossible for any future president to do his job. And for an intelligence official or operative to treat Trump\u2019s talks with Ukraine as a potential violation of law seems, at best, an overreach. Here, too, there are echoes of the \u201ccollusion\u201d hoax, with a politicized US security establishment actively working to undermine a duly elected chief executive.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jonathan Tobin", "Nypost.Com Trump-Ukraine-And-Yet-Another-Liberal-Rush-To-Cry-Impeachment"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
