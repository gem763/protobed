I don't know if I'd run around touting it as a major political issue.\"\n\nBothwell said you would have to go back more than 100 years to find a US president intervening in a Canadian federal election.\n\nHe said former US President Theodore Roosevelt, who was president from 1901 to 1909, visited Toronto in 1917 when Canada was having an election about conscription and spoke in favour of it. But Bothwell said he did not know how explicit he was.\n\nNelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, called Obama's endorsement rare and said it possibly has not happened before but he does not think it will move the polls.\n\n190922173019750\n\n\"In fact, some people may feel this is an unwarranted foreign intrusion in Canada's election,\" Wiseman said.\n\nObama also endorsed Emmanuel Macron for president in France's 2017 election, and he warned British voters against backing leaving the European Union.\n\nTrudeau formed a close relationship with Obama when he was president and the two were pictured having dinner in Ottawa earlier this year.\n\nThe former president has long been popular with many Canadians. Trudeau's Liberal Party posted Obama's message into a party fundraising pitch that was emailed directly to potential donors\n\nTrudeau's rival, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, said that he is \"not very interested what former foreign leaders are saying\". He said he would let Canadians judge whether Obama's endorsement is appropriate.", "description": "Canadian analysts say such an endorsement is rare, but probably won't move the polls.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2016/3/10/625427c75589450288028a96657e8256_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
