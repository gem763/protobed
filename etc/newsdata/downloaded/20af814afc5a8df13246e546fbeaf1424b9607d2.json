I still get #mufc fans coming up to me saying \u201cRio, that goal against Liverpool was my childhood\u201d or something of that nature.. (I have to ask what one as I have scored a couple of bangers against them!) But it just shows you what this game means to Manchester United & the fans,\u2019 the former United centre-back said on Instagram.\n\n\u2018As a player who comes into the club & who isn\u2019t local you are quickly made aware what this game means to you \u2013 EVERYTHING.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t lose, you leave everything on that pitch, you win your individual battles, you give their fans nothing to shout about, you send them back across the M62 in silence\u2026I could go on!\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s about every single one of the squad understanding the importance of Man Utd vs #LFC. You would see some new players, British or foreign, after a game sitting there wide eyed saying \u201cI didn\u2019t realise it was this mad & that the city gets so crazy leading up to the game\u201d.\n\n\u2018Losing just isn\u2019t an option & today that couldn\u2019t apply more. The position #MUFC are in adds even more pressure on the players. The players can\u2019t see it like us fans though \u2013 thinking about all of the above just adds to the pressure of a game of this magnitude. The players have to see this game as a huge opportunity for themselves as individuals & as a team to be the catalyst for a bright new future by playing an important role in getting a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This is an opportunity to play a pivotal role in turning around the fortunes at this great club. That should make them excited going into this game not fearful \u2013 fear comes with not being able to handle the pressure. We can\u2019t go there. Seize the opportunity should be the mentality going into this game. Go and do it.\n\n\u2018Enjoy these moments, they are great\u2026\u2026when you win! Good luck to the boys. Rio.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMORE: Dean Smith sends message to Manchester United over \u00a350m John McGinn pursuit", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has likened Manchester United's impending encounter with Liverpool to the side's memorable match against Paris Saint-Germain last season.
