Adam Schiff\u2019s (D-CA) \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d targeting President Donald Trump is actually unclassified, revealed Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) in a Wednesday interview on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.\n\nSchiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee which is conducting the \u201cimpeachment inquiry,\u201d is instructing ostensible witnesses their testimony is unclassified.\n\n\u201cI thought they were pretending to hear classified information, and that\u2019s why they had to do it in this super-secret SCIF,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cIt turns out that every person who has testified as part of this bogus against-the-rules impeachment inquiry [has been] instructed as they begin their testimony \u2014 I didn\u2019t find this out until I got in the room and started to talk to some of the members in there about what had gone on without us \u2014 [that their testimony is unclassified].\u201d\n\nGohmert continued, \u201c[Adam Schiff] always tells the witness before they start to testify, \u2018Look, we\u2019re in a SCIF, but this hearing \u2014 this testimony you\u2019re going to give \u2014 is unclassified. So it\u2019s unclassified, if somebody asks you something the answer to which you think might be classified, then you can just tell us you can\u2019t answer it [because] it might be classified,\u2019 which, to me, sounds like [Adam Schiff] telling them, \u2018Hey, anything that makes you uncomfortable, just say it\u2019s classified and you don\u2019t have to answer it.'\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nThe Schiff-run \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d should be transparent, Gohmert determined.\n\n\u201cBut I was shocked to find out they were conducting this as an unclassified testimony, in which case there is absolutely no reason not to allow every member of Congress to hear it, not to allow it on C-SPAN,\u201d Gohmert stated. \u201cIt is outrageous.\u201d\n\nLikening the secretive nature of the \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d to a grand jury is a \u201cbad metaphor,\u201d explained Gohmert.\n\n\u201cI heard our majority leader, Steny Hoyer, on the floor of the House tonight, say that this was like a grand jury,\u201d Gohmert recalled. \u201cWell, let me tell you, I have impaneled many grand juries. I\u2019ve been before grand juries as a prosecutor, and I\u2019m telling you, a grand jury has to allow every single voting member of the grand jury to hear all the testimony. I think it\u2019s a bad metaphor,\u201d\n\nGrand jurors \u201chear everything,\u201d noted Gohmert, contrasting grand jury standards in the context of criminal justice to the majority of elected representatives being denied access to the Schiff-run \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d in the context of an impeachment vote in the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cGrand juries hear things in secret, and then they have their vote, and then we find out what happened,\u201d Gohmert remarked. \u201cEvery grand jury that\u2019s going to vote gets to hear everything. If that doesn\u2019t happen, then we\u2019ll just get rid of that panel and get another grand jury. Every single member of Congress has a right to vote on whether or not to approve the charges. \u2026 But everybody gets to vote, and everybody that votes gets to hear every word. This is a sham.\u201d\n\nActing U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor\u2018s testimony during the \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d amounts to unreliable hearsay, Gohmert explained, drawing on Taylor\u2019s military service.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any commander worth his or her salt that would accept a witness coming in and saying, \u2018Ma\u2019am, this person told me that \u2014 although he was speculating \u2014 he thinks this other person may have said this,\u2019 Gohmert said. \u201cThe commander would throw him out of the office, throw him out of the tent. They would never allow that kind of thing. You don\u2019t allow that to be what gets somebody indicted or charged, either.\u201d\n\nGohmert went on, \u201cIf you look at Taylor, even in his opening statement, he admits he had no firsthand knowledge, [and] that he got this from somebody else who said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m just speculating on this.\u2019 My word. You\u2019re going to destroy a country, create a civil war, throw a man who was duly elected out of office, because some guy that at one time was honorable \u2014 served the country \u2014 has now shown he has no honor in coming before a body and saying, \u2018Well, I heard this from somebody that heard something that they think might have been this.\u2019? Are you kidding me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis once honorable soldier certainly wasn\u2019t honorable yesterday when he came in and testified,\u201d added Gohmert.\n\nSchiff\u2019s \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d is predicated on hearsay, Gohmert said.\n\n\u201cThe people that have testified, like Taylor, that they heard something from somebody that heard something from somebody else, then they went and told others,\u201d Gohmert stated. \u201cI\u2019m sure that [Adam Schiff] is going to want to bring in everybody they told what they heard somebody else heard, and we\u2019re going to keep going \u2019til we get tenth-, or eleventh-, or twelfth-hand hearsay.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cso-called whistleblowers\u201d used by Schiff and his news media allies are \u201cgossip-mongers\u201d who are \u201c[putting] the country on the brink of [destruction] based on multiple layers of hearsay,\u201d added Gohmert.\n\n\u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t know anything first-hand,\u201d said Gohmert of Taylor. \u201cIt\u2019s all speculation from others who are speculating. That\u2019s no way to do justice. [It\u2019s] even Orwellian. My chief of staff [said] it\u2019s Kafkaesque. \u2026 It\u2019s so Kafka-esque.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.", "description": "Despite being run in a SCIF,\u00a0Adam Schiff's impeachment inquiry is actually unclassified, revealed Louie Gohmert.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/schiff-entering-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
