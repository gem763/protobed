Forkner, then chief technical pilot for Boeing\u2019s 737, wrote to technical pilot Patrik Gustavsson that the MCAS was engaging \u201citself like craxy,\u201d calling the problem \u201cegregious.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nForkner, who had a major role in the Max, also indicated that the Boeing employees misled the Federal Aviation Administration. \u201cSo I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly),\u201d he wrote.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a lie, no one told us that was the case,\u201d Gustavsson replied.\n\nThe messages show the company experts had identified critical safety concerns with the Max years ago, even as Boeing executives have publicly argued since the crashes on Oct. 29 and March 10 that the company had followed the same internal practices and FAA certification procedures that have long produced safe airplanes.\n\nBoeing did not turn the messages over to the Transportation Department until Thursday, federal officials said. The document \u201ccontaining statements by a former Boeing employee\u201d was given to Congress on Friday, Boeing said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nIn a letter to Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg on Friday, FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson said: \u201cI expect your explanation immediately.\u201d\n\nThe FAA said in a statement that it \u201cfinds the substance of the document concerning. The FAA is also disappointed that Boeing did not bring this document to our attention immediately upon its discovery.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe flurry of messages between the pilots came over a 10-minute stretch in 2016 as the company was working with the FAA to obtain the safety certification needed to sell the Max in the United States and around the world. The new plane was critical to Boeing\u2019s plans to compete with rival Airbus. The FAA granted Boeing the coveted certification in March 2017.\n\nAD\n\nA copy of the message chain was given to the Justice Department in February in connection with the criminal probe into the Max, according to Richard Cullen, an attorney at McGuire Woods representing Boeing.\n\nCullen said the document was produced properly and in a timely fashion \u201cto the appropriate agency.\u201d\n\nA separate set of emails from Forkner to FAA officials, in which the Boeing executive often assumed a familiar or chummy tone, showed an active company effort to remove references to the MCAS from the Flight Crew Operating Manual.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI noticed a few things that should be changed,\u201d Forkner wrote to one FAA official in 2017. \u201cDelete MCAS, recall we decided we weren\u2019t going to cover it in the\u201d Flight Crew Operating Manual since it is \u201cway outside the normal operating envelope,\u201d meaning what pilots would typically face.\n\nAD\n\nA report released last week by a group of international and U.S. aviation safety experts found the decision to remove the reference to the MCAS in that document meant the FAA board that considers requirements for preparing pilots \u201cwas not in a position to adequately assess training needs.\u201d\n\nInvestigators have noted that assumptions that pilots could immediately handle an MCAS problem proved deadly.\n\nIn a 2016 email, Forkner told an FAA official he was \u201cdoing a bunch of travelling through the next few months\u201d and that he would be \u201cjedi-mind tricking regulators into accepting the training that I got accepted by the FAA etc.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBoeing said Friday it \u201cwill continue to cooperate\u201d with an investigation by the House Transportation Committee and \u201cwe will continue to follow the direction of the FAA and other global regulators, as we work to safely return the 737 Max to service.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a call to Dickson on Friday, Muilenburg told the administrator that the company is \u201ctaking every step possible to safely return the Max\u201d to the air, Boeing said.\n\nForkner moved to Southwest Airlines last year. Gustavsson was promoted to Boeing\u2019s 737 chief technical pilot in 2018, according to a LinkedIn listing. Boeing did not answer a question about Gustavsson\u2019s current role.\n\nThe existence of the instant messages was first reported by Reuters.\n\nRep. Peter A. DeFazio, chairman of the Transportation Committee, said the message chain showed \u201cBoeing withheld damning information from the FAA.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis exchange is shocking, but disturbingly consistent with what we\u2019ve seen so far in our ongoing investigation,\u201d DeFazio (D-Ore.) said, pointing to \u201ca lack of candor with regulators and customers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is not about one employee; this is about a failure of a safety culture at Boeing in which undue pressure is placed on employees to meet deadlines and ensure profitability at the expense of safety,\u201d DeFazio said.\n\nIn a letter to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Friday, DeFazio said the \u201cjedi-mind tricking\u201d email and others showed \u201can improper coziness between the regulator and the regulated,\u201d and added that it was \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d that the FAA had not previously provided his committee with those and other requested emails months ago.\n\nForkner set the tone early in the 2016 messages, writing: \u201cI\u2019m locked in my hotel room with an ice cold grey goose, I\u2019ll probably fire off a few dozen inappropriate emails before I call it a night.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGustavsson asked if Forkner had accomplished anything in the flight simulator. \u201cOr what is the normal chaos there?\u201d he wrote.\n\nForkner joked about what would happen if they no longer worked together and said, if Gustavsson left Boeing, \u201cI\u2019d ask for a job in sales where I can just get paid to drink with customers and lie about how awesome our airplanes are.\u201d\n\nThe MCAS was \u201crunning rampant\u201d in the simulator, Forkner wrote.\n\nThe feature was supposed to compensate for design changes and help make the 737 Max feel the same in the air for pilots used to earlier models of the 737. It would achieve that by automatically adjusting the way the plane was flying by moving the horizontal stabilizer on the plane\u2019s tail. The stabilizer makes the aircraft ascend or descend.\n\nAD\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board last month described how, in the run-up to the Oct. 29 crash in Indonesia, the MCAS automatically pushed the plane\u2019s nose down \u201cmore than 20 times\u201d in a six-minute stretch before it plunged into the Java Sea. Investigators say faulty data from a sensor caused the feature, which had been made increasingly powerful over the course of the airplane\u2019s development, to repeatedly misfire.\n\nAD\n\nIn the message chain, the technical pilots talked about how the plane, in more than one simulated scenario, was aggressively adjusting how much it was heading either up or down, a process known as \u201ctrimming.\u201d Pilots often do that manually, but the MCAS does it automatically in certain cases.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m levelling off at like 4000 ft, 230 knots and the plane is trimming itself like craxy. . . . I\u2019m like, WHAT?\u201d Forkner wrote.\n\n\u201cthat\u2019s what i saw on sim one, but on approach . . . I think thats wrong,\u201d Gustavsson responded. He later said they needed to ask colleagues \u201cto confirm what its supposed to be doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cVince is going to get me some spreadsheet table that shows when it\u2019s supposed to kick in. . . . why are we just now hearing about this?\u201d Forkner asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, the test pilots have kept us out of the loop,\u201d Gustavsson wrote, before clarifying that one colleague \u201cis trying to work with us, but she has been too busy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThey were \u201call so damn busy, and getting pressure from the program,\u201d Forkner wrote.\n\n\u201cThat is true, I wouldnt want to be them,\u201d Gustavsson wrote.\n\nThe 737 Max has been grounded since March, shortly after the second crash in Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia. Boeing has been working on a software fix for the MCAS and other problems discovered as part of the recertification process.", "description": "Boeing officials failed to turn over the text messages to federal officials until this week.", "authors": ["Michael Laris", "Transportation Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DZh_6spXrrPE8z1zQn0Zlzu5uuQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M2UX63HR2EI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
