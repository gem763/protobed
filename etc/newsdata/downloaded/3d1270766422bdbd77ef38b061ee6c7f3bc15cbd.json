The chief question asked about Google\u2019s latest flagship is no different from in years past: Can Google deliver a smartphone that will at long last get you to leave Apple or Samsung behind?\n\nIn fact, Google made strides a year ago when the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3XL devices generated mostly strong reviews based on excellent cameras, plus a telemarketer-killer feature that lets you screen calls at the push of a button.\n\nNeil Mawston, the executive director of Strategy Analytics global wireless practices in the U.K., says Google is America\u2019s fastest-growing smartphone vendor, and Pixel more than doubled its market share in the USA from 2% in the second quarter of 2018 to a record 5% in 2019.\n\nThose figures still pale next to the iPhone and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy line. Or as Techsponential lead analyst Avi Greengart puts it, \u201cI suspect that Pixel sales would be a rounding error for Apple.\u201d\n\nCan Google build on its predecessors? Through rumors and leaks, we have a pretty good sense of what the Pixel 4 might look like.\n\nFirst off, there are likely to be at least two models, a Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, and judging by early images released by Google, the devices appear to have multiple rear cameras housed in a square configuration.\n\nThe phones will have some version of facial recognition \u2013 yes, like Apple\u2019s Face ID, the promise is that you'll be able to use your mug to authenticate your identity. It appears you\u2019ll be able to employ motion gestures to control content on the device or even silence incoming calls.\n\nWe'll probably find out whether orange is the new black since Google will sell an orange-colored Pixel.\n\nVaping crisis: Deadly vaping crisis threatens to ensnare Juul's lucrative marijuana sibling, Pax Labs\n\nThe latest Pixels will run Android 10 out of the gate, given Google\u2019s pedigree with the mobile operating system.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what the phones will cost or whether Google will release a 5G variant.\n\nThere are the other wild cards surrounding the event. Will Google showcase new wireless earbuds? Chromebook computers? Something fresh from Nest?\n\nUSA TODAY will report on the scene, and you can watch Google\u2019s livestream of the event.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Pixel 4: What we know about Google's latest smartphone", "description": "The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are Google's latest attempts to gain ground against the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy.
