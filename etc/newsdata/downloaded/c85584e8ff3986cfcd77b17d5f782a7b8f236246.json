During an event at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Deputy Treasury Secretary Justin Muzinich will announce a plan for the dissemination of Treasury trading data to the public, according to another Treasury official who asked not to be named.\n\nThe very basics of trading are at issue here. In the U.S. stock market, the price, size and time of transactions are usually reported within a second. For corporate bonds, it\u2019s 15 minutes or less. Reflecting the private-club feel that\u2019s long dominated the business, there\u2019s no comparable disclosure in Treasuries, which set rates for trillions of dollars worth of assets like mortgages.\n\nThe details of the decision will affect a broad swath of market participants, from banks to high-frequency traders. A raucous public debate stretching back to 2016, if not earlier, has pitted bond dealers against high-speed trading firms over what data should be public. Wall Street banks argue greater transparency will make it harder for them to trade. Automated market makers, which play an increasingly key role in modern trading, think more information will help them buy and sell more as well as reduce costs.\n\nThis annual gathering has been part of a push by authorities to shed light on the workings of this business following an extreme bout of volatility in October 2014. The episode involved a 12-minute crash and rebound in yields with no apparent trigger. It prompted the first government review of the market since 1998 and, in 2017, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority began collecting market data on Trace, the agency\u2019s bond-price reporting system. For now, only regulators, including Treasury, can view the data.\n\nThe Treasury market has grown to more than $16 trillion from about $7 trillion a decade ago.\n\nCitigroup Inc. and several other bond dealers opposed broad dissemination of trade information to the public, saying it would make it tough for banks to assume large amounts of risk on behalf of their clients, and increase the potential for transactions in U.S. debt -- particularly older securities that changes hands less frequently -- would move the market.\n\nHigh-speed trading firms such as KCG Holdings Inc. -- acquired by Virtu Financial Inc. in 2017 -- have advocated for public release, seeing it as an enhancing trading efficiency and opening up the Treasury market to more participants. Billionaire Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund, Citadel LLC, has touted that more data may actually give investors a bargaining chip to win better execution from their trading partners.\n\nThe protracted length of Treasury\u2019s deliberations on this topic has frustrated market participants.\n\nAfter two years of work on the matter under former Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Mnuchin\u2019s team took over. Craig Phillips, who had been spearheading the effort before he left the government in June, said at this same gathering at the New York Fed last year that they were focused on taking the time needed so their ultimate action would \u201cdo no harm\u201d to the Treasury market.\n\n(An earlier version of this story corrected the spelling of the Treasury\u2019s Secretary\u2019s name)\n\n(Adds detail on the growth of the Treasury market in paragraph 6)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Liz Capo McCormick in New York at emccormick7@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Nick Baker, Jenny Paris\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- After years of review over a hotly debated issue, the U.S. government finally has a plan to make the $16 trillion Treasury market less opaque.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s debt managers will on Monday reveal to an audience of Wall Street\u2019s elite, central bankers and regulators the", "authors": ["Liz Capo Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iwV9nC78ima0r1A2rBqkHg--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/e20f7475a7c14ee78884a1d961f6ffe1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
