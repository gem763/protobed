(Photo: AP)\n\nWashington's farewell address wasn't delivered as a speech. Instead, it was published in a Philadelphia newspaper in September, 1796. And it wasn't his last address: He delivered his final State of the Union address three months later.\n\nIt's still considered the one of the greatest addresses in American history, and is remembered for the advice that Washington gave to the young country \u2014 advice succeeding generations have consistently ignored.\n\nWashington warned against entangling alliances with Old World powers: \"It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world, so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements,\" he wrote. \"I repeat, therefore, let those engagements be unwise to extend them.\"\n\nHe warned against partisanship: \"The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism.\"\n\nAnd he when warned against regional rivalries between North and South, Atlantic and West, he may well have been writing about red states and blue states.\n\n\"One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts,\" he wrote. \"You can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection.\"\n\nThe enduring historical and cultural relevance of Washington's farewell is evidenced by the hit Broadway musical Hamilton, which sets passages of the speech to music in the Act II number \"One Last TIme.\" Indeed, Alexander Hamilton had tremendous influence in composing and editing the address.\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\nThis April 17, 2015 shows the front of the U.S. $20 bill, featuring a likeness of Andrew Jackson, seventh President of the United States. (Photo: Bill Sikes, AP)\n\nPresident Andrew Jackson's stock has diminished in recent memory, mostly because of his treatment of American Indians. His opposition to paper money has also led to a successful campaign to remove his portrait from the front of the $20 bill, replacing him with Harriet Tubman. .\n\nIndeed, almost half of his farewell address was devoted to a denunciation of monetary policy, including what he called \"mischiefs and dangers of a paper currency.\"\n\nBut his address was also optimistic, reflecting a maturing of the early republic. \"Our Constitution is no longer a doubtful experiment, and at the end of nearly half a century we find that it has preserved unimpaired the liberties of the people, secured the rights of property, and that our country has improved and is flourishing beyond any former example in the history of nations,\" he wrote.\n\nJackson quoted from Washington's address, which he said \"should be cherished in the heart of every citizen to the latest generation,\" and again warned of regional factionalism.\n\n\"Mutual suspicions and reproaches may in time create mutual hostility, and artful and designing men will always be found who are ready to foment these fatal divisions and to inflame the natural jealousies of different sections of the country. The history of the world is full of such examples, and especially the history of republics,\" Jackson wrote. \"What have you to gain by division and dissension? Delude not yourselves with the belief that a breach once made may be afterwards repaired.\"\n\nHarry Truman\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman holds up a copy of an election day copy of the Chicago Tribune, which, based on early election night results, mistakenly announced \"Dewey Defeats Truman\" for the benefit of the throng that turned out to greet him at St. Louis' Union Station on November 4, 1948. (Photo: BYRON ROLLINS, Associated Press)\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt took advantage of radio to communicate directly with the American people, but he died in office and never had an opportunity for a farewell. That left it to Truman to revive the practice of a farewell address in a radio speech from the Oval Office.\n\nTruman's farewell address was largely devoted to describing the job of the presidency, which he did in Trumanesque fashion.\n\n\"The greatest part of the president's job is to make decisions \u2014 big ones and small ones, dozens of them almost every day. The papers may circulate around the government for a while but they finally reach this desk. And then, there's no place else for them to go. The president \u2014 whoever he is \u2014 has to decide. He can't pass the buck to anybody. No one else can do the deciding for him. That's his job,\" he said.\n\n\"So, as I empty the drawers of this desk, and as Mrs. Truman and I leave the White House, we have no regret. We feel we have done our best in the public service. I hope and believe we have contributed to the welfare of this Nation and to the peace of the world.\"\n\nDwight Eisenhower\n\nIn this 1956 file photo, President Dwight Eisenhower is seen at his desk at the White House in Washington. (Photo: Anonymous, AP)\n\nLike Washington, Eisenhower used his farewell address to give largely ignored admonitions his successors. This was the speech that coined the term \"military-industrial complex.\"\n\n\"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist,\" he cautioned.\n\nPart of that complex was the government's increasing control over technological innovation, warning that scientific research \"could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.\"\n\nAnd he offered a word about deficit spending. \"As we peer into society's future, we \u2013 you and I, and our government \u2013 must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without asking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.\"\n\nLyndon Johnson\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson in his State of the Union message before a joint session of Congress in 1964. (Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nHaving spent most of his career in the halls of Congress, a sentimental Lyndon Johnson returned there to deliver his farewell in the form of his final State of the Union address, delivered six days before the end of his presidency.\n\nHe outlined the successes of his \"Great Society\" programs, including Medicare, voting rights, Head Start.\n\n\"We have finished a major part of the old agenda. Some of the laws that we wrote have already, in front of our eyes, taken on the flesh of achievement,\" he said. \"These achievements completed the full cycle, from idea to enactment and, finally, to a place in the lives of citizens all across this country.\"\n\nBut his farewell also acknowledged a lack of progress overseas. \"I regret more than any of you know that it has not been possible to restore peace to South Vietnam.\"\n\nRichard Nixon\n\nIn this Aug. 9, 1974 file photo, Richard Nixon waves goodbye with a salute to his staff members outside the White House as he boards a helicopter and e resigns the presidency on Aug. 9, 1974. (Photo: AP)\n\nAs the only president ever to resign from office, Richard Nixon's farewell was not on his own terms. His 16-minute televised speech from the Oval Office lacked much of the vitriol that history remembers him for.\n\n\"I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as president, I must put the interests of America first,\" he said. \"To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the president and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home.\n\n\"Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office,\" he said.\n\n\"To those who have not felt able to give me your support, let me say I leave with no bitterness toward those who have opposed me, because all of us, in the final analysis, have been concerned with the good of the country, however our judgments might differ,\" he said. \"I shall leave this office with regret at not completing my term, but with gratitude for the privilege of serving as your president for the past five-and-a-half years.\"\n\nGerald Ford\n\nPresident Gerald Ford pardons Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, Sept. 8, 1974. (Photo: Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library)\n\nHaving succeeded Nixon in office, Gerald Ford is the only president to deliver a farewell address but not an inaugural. The occasion again was the State of the Union Address.\n\n\"Like President Washington, like the more fortunate of his successors, I look forward to the status of private citizen with gladness and gratitude. To me, being a citizen of the United States of America is the greatest honor and privilege in this world,\" he said.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, I once asked you for your prayers, and now I give you mine: May God guide this wonderful country, its people, and those they have chosen to lead them. May our third century be illuminated by liberty and blessed with brotherhood, so that we and all who come after us may be the humble servants of thy peace. Amen.\"\n\nJimmy Carter\n\nIn this April 25, 1980 file photo, President Jimmy Carter prepares to make a national television address from the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, on the failed mission to rescue the Iran hostages. (Photo: AP)\n\nJimmy Carter's farewell address, delivered from the Oval Office, was as much the beginning of his post-presidency as it was the end of his presidency, signalling his enduring work in human rights over the next four decades.\n\n\"The struggle for human rights overrides all differences of color or nation or language. Those who hunger for freedom, who thirst for human dignity, and who suffer for the sake of justice, they are the patriots of this cause,\" he said. \"I believe with all my heart that America must always stand for these basic human rights at home and abroad. That is both our history and our destiny.\"\n\n\"The battle for human rights, at home and abroad, is far from over,\" he said. \"As I return home to the South, where I was born and raised, I look forward to the opportunity to reflect and further to assess, I hope with accuracy, the circumstances of our times. I intend to give our new president my support, and I intend to work as a citizen, as I've worked here in this office as president, for the values this nation was founded to secure.\"\n\nRonald Reagan\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan (Photo: SCOTT STEWART, Associated Press)\n\nIn his final Oval Office address, Ronald Reagan hearkened back to the \"shining city on a hill,\" the biblical reference from Jesus' \"Sermon on the Mount\" that formed the basis of much of his campaign imagery.\n\n\"I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it, and see it still,\" he said.\n\nReagan spoke longingly of returning to his California ranch, and ended with a nod to the Reagan revolutionaries that ushered in an era of more conservative government.\n\n\"Once you begin a great movement, there's no telling where it will end. We meant to change a nation, and instead, we changed a world,\" he said. \"My friends: We did it. We weren't just marking time. We made a difference. We made the city stronger, we made the city freer, and we left her in good hands. All in all, not bad, not bad at all.\"\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush\n\nFormer President George Bush shown in a 1992 file photo. (Photo: RON EDMONDS, Associated Press)\n\nGeorge Bush's farewell address was unconventional by modern standards. Though historians consider his speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to be his farewell, he himself didn't consider it as such.\n\nStill, it's easy to detect an air of finality in the speech to cadets in the West Point mess hall. \"I am about to get on with the rest of my life,\" he said. \"But before I do, I want to share with you at this institution of leadership some of my thinking, both about the world you will soon be called upon to enter and the life that you have chosen.\"\n\nWhat followed was a reflection on America's role in the world following the end of the Cold War.\n\n\"Yes, the end of the cold war, we would all concede, is a blessing. It is a time of great promise. Democratic governments have never been so numerous,\" he said.\n\n\"But this does not mean that there is no specter of war, no threats to be reckoned with,\" he said. \"And already, we see disturbing signs of what this new world could become if we are passive and aloof. We would risk the emergence of a world characterized by violence, characterized by chaos, one in which dictators and tyrants threaten their neighbors, build arsenals brimming with weapons of mass destruction, and ignore the welfare of their own men, women, and children. And we could see a horrible increase in international terrorism, with American citizens more at risk than ever before.\"\n\nBill Clinton\n\nPresident Bill Clinton poses for photographs after addressing the nation from the Oval Office in the White House June, 10, 1999. (Photo: JOYCE NALTCHAYAN, AFP)\n\nFamous for his longwindedness, Clinton's Oval Office goodbye is actually the shortest presidential farewell on record \u2014 just 1,109 words.\n\nHe left with three thoughts about the nation's future, encouraging succeeding generations to pay down the national debt, embrace globalism and accept diversity.\n\n\"As for me, I'll leave the presidency more idealistic, more full of hope than the day I arrived, and more confident than ever that America's best days lie ahead,\" Clinton said. \"My days in this office are nearly through, but my days of service, I hope, are not. In the years ahead, I will never hold a position higher or a covenant more sacred than that of president of the United States. But there is no title I will wear more proudly than that of citizen.\"\n\nGeorge W. Bush\n\nPresident George W. Bush pauses in the Oval Office after addressing the nation on his strategy for Iraq, Thursday, Sept. 13, 2007. (Photo: J. SCOTT APPLEWHITE, AP)\n\nLike most of his presidency, George W. Bush's Oval Office farewell was devoted mostly to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the wars that followed. In what seemed like a rare moment of introspection, he seemed to ask history not to judge him too harshly.\n\n\"Like all who have held this office before me, I have experienced setbacks. And there are things I would do differently if given the chance. Yet I've always acted with the best interests of our country in mind. I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right. You may not agree with some of the tough decisions I have made, but I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisions,\" he said.\n\nQuoting Thomas Jefferson, he ended on an optimistic note: \"I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.\"\n\n\"It has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your president. There have been good days and tough days. But every day I have been inspired by the greatness of our country and uplifted by the goodness of our people. I have been blessed to represent this nation we love. And I will always be honored to carry a title that means more to me than any other, citizen of the United States of America.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ih9l79", "description": "George Washington's 1796 farewell address still echoes through the words of departing presidents even two centuries later.", "authors": ["Gregory Korte", "Published P.M.
