A recent report revealed that none have yet been granted.\n\nFortunately for Huawei, one of the stand-out features of its flagship phones in recent years has been its camera, and this is expected to continue with the launch of the Mate 30.\n\nThe flagship phone continues its partnership with German camera company Leica, which has seen increasingly advanced photography capabilities in recent iterations of the Mate series.\n\nRumours surrounding the Mate 30 suggest Huawei is planning to introduce even more camera lenses, with a leaked case revealing space for up to five rear lenses.\n\nThe successor to the Mate 20 is also likely to support 5G connectivity.", "description": "Huawei\u00a0has announced that its next flagship smartphone will be unveiled later this month \u2013 marking the first major product release since its controversial US trade ban.
