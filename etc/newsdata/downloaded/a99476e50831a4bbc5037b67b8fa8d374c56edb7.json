The Navy currently has 290 ships and, were it to fully implement the 2020 shipbuilding plan, it would achieve its goal of 355 ships by 2034.\n\nAs is to be expected, as the size of the fleet grows, the annual cost of maintaining and sustaining that force is expected to rise from $60 billion a year to roughly $90 billion by 2049, CBO reports.\n\nVariations in the Navy and CBO estimates stem from different methodologies and considerations. CBO explains that the difference is the result of uncertainty surrounding future systems and capability demands. Furthermore, the Navy does not account for \"faster growth in the costs of labor and materials in the shipbuilding industry than in the economy as a whole.\"\n\nThese estimates only matter if the plan remains unchanged, which is unlikely given the Navy's interest in unmanned attritable platforms, or expendable platforms that can used to wear down an enemy, and ongoing efforts by the Marine Corps to reevaluate current needs, which may lead it to reassess its large amphibious assault ships.", "description": "The Navy's shipbuilding plan says it will need to spend $660 billion over the next 30 years, but that could go as high as $865 billion, CBO reports.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e23263b33a7684c29aa43?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
