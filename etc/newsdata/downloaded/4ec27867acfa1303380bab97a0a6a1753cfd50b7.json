Well! Paramount is tired of letting this property sit on the shelf, so they\u2019re decided to make a reboot.\n\nOren Uziel will write the script, and his most recent project is the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog movie, which means anything is liable to happen here. According to Deadline\u2019s report, they will be bringing on a new cast, but didn\u2019t specify if that means new characters or just new actors to play the old ones. It\u2019s hard to imagine a Face/Off without Castor Troy, and almost impossible to conjure one without Nic Cage as Castor Troy going full Cage crazy in the film\u2019s craziest moments.", "description": "Paramount announced that they\u2019re going forward with a reboot of John Woo\u2019s Face/Off, and it will be written by Oren Uziel.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/09/09-face-off.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
