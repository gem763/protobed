A wild card in the race for the Senate, however, is the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s approval ratings have definitely been on the lower end of his historic range,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor of The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan publication that tracks Senate races.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re Susan Collins or Martha McSally or Cory Gardner this does not help the cause of your reelection to have to take these votes.

When independents turn like this, like they\u2019re starting to turn, it\u2019s probably the indication of another blue wave.\u201d\n\nTold that Senate Republicans have privately admitted they are concerned over what they see as Trump\u2019s disorganized response, Duffy said \u201cthey should be.\u201d\n\nPolls show that Trump\u2019s disapproval rating is near the highest point of his presidency.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA Rasmussen Reports survey published Monday showed the president\u2019s disapproval rating at 54 percent, 9 points higher than in late September.\n\nA Quinnipiac University Poll published last week showed that 55 percent of voters approve of the House impeachment inquiry, the highest level seen so far.\n\nBut other polls show support for the president isn\u2019t crumbling.\n\nA Marquette University Law School poll published last week showed that only 44 percent of voters in Wisconsin, which is considered a key \u201ctipping point\u201d state, favor impeaching Trump and removing him from office, while 51 percent do not support that outcome.\n\nAn Emerson Polling survey conducted in mid-October showed that 48 percent of Iowa voters oppose impeachment, while 42 percent support it.\n\nA series of recent missteps and setbacks, however, has made Senate Republicans nervous about the emerging political picture.\n\nOne damaging blow came earlier this month when White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyTimeline: Trump, Ukraine and impeachment Key impeachment testimony: What we've learned so far Pence demurs on whether diplomats alleging quid pro quo are lying MORE admitted at a press conference that the administration held up military aid to Ukraine in order to press Ukrainian officials to investigate corruption possibly related to former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry Army officer twice reported concerns about Trump's Ukraine tactics Ex-Trump official's refusal to testify escalates impeachment tensions MORE.\n\nAnother came last week when William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to the Ukraine, testified before the House that military assistance to Ukraine was explicitly tied to investigating Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nA senior Senate Republican strategist predicted the impeachment will play out differently in different states.\n\nIn Democratic-leaning states, it\u2019s likely to be a problem for Republican incumbents who will have to contend with energized Democratic voters. But in Republican-leaning states, such as Alabama, the effect will be the reverse, with GOP voters mobilizing in defense of Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shirts and skins game,\u201d the strategist said.\n\nA second Republican strategist said that impeachment could also boomerang to hurt Democratic candidates.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s telling that no Democratic Senate candidate out there has embraced this issue, even in Colorado and Maine. Democrats have not yet used this as a wedge issue to really emphasize on the campaign trail,\u201d the strategist said.\n\nThe strategist said \u201cindependent voters are still a bit concerned that Democrats in the House are overreaching on this subject.\u201d\n\nThe Senate\u2019s most vulnerable Republican incumbents have avoided commenting on Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine or on other reported findings of the House impeachment investigation.\n\nCollins has told reporters that she needs to maintain her neutrality as a potential juror, Gardner often keeps a cellphone pressed to his ear as he speed-walks through the Capitol and McSally says she\u2019s focused on her Senate work.\n\nBut these vulnerable incumbents and other Republicans facing tough races will likely have to vote on articles of impeachment passed by the House at some point in the near future.\n\nJames Wallner, a former Senate Republican aide, said Collins and Gardner, who represent states Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonWarren's careful approach with media pays off Trump Jr. sending copies of 'Triggered' book to Romney, top Democrats No, Hillary Clinton should not run for president in 2020 MORE won in 2016, face the biggest danger because \u201cyou could have a situation where an impeachment trial emboldens the base on the Democratic side and drives turnout.\u201d\n\nBut Wallner noted that \u201can impeachment trial also gives them an o pportunity to distinguish themselves vis-a-vis the Republican Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is a trial, it gives Gardner the opportunity to \u2014 depending on how that trial is concluded \u2014 to say, \u2018Look, I\u2019m not your average Republican,\u2019 \u201d by voting for a censure resolution or in favor of an article of impeachment, he added.\n\nSenate Republicans face another disadvantage: They must defend 22 seats compared to the 12 that Democrats must defend.\n\nOnly Jones, who won a surprising upset in a 2017 special election where he faced a Republican opponent accused of sexual misconduct toward underage girls, is considered truly vulnerable in the Democratic conference.", "description": "Impeachment is raising the likelihood that the Senate will be a real battleground next year, and that Democrats could regain the majority.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gardnercory_collinssuan_mcsallymartha_102819gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
