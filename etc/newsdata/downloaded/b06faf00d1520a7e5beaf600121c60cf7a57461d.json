Why? What are we waiting for? No, things should change,\" he added.\n\n\n\nThe artwork was hung up, with pig heads placed at the bottom of it and money strewn on the floor. Notes were also in the mouths of the pigs.\n\n\n\nIt displayed former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste receiving fellatio from a black woman, which was meant to be exhibited at the Constitutional Hill, he said.\n\n\n\nIt was allegedly rejected by Constitutional Hill due to it \"being too controversial\".\n\n\n\nAs a result, Mabulu chose the JSE as \"a perfect new home\", saying it was inspired by the hold which white monopoly capitalism had on South Africa, namely the Steinhoff saga.\n\n\n\nMabulu is currently being held at Morningside Police Station.\n\n\n\nPolice have not yet confirmed the charges.", "description": "Controversial artist Ayanda Mabulu was arrested outside the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, following a display of his artwork stating, \"blame it on the boers\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1347/21cd0d7536c341bb9a694029db20ef92.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-12"}
