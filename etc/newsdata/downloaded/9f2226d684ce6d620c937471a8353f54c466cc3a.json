Nunberg assumed this was because of how little Trump must pay in taxes.\n\n\u201cHe thought he could defend the return,\u201d says Nunberg, who did not himself view Trump\u2019s returns. \u201cI inferred from the conversation that he believed that it was a low number and he\u2019d look savvy.\u201d\n\nA second person, a former senior adviser to Trump, who also joined them for lunch that day, recalls Trump being enthusiastic about releasing his returns for this reason.\n\nNunberg remembers that at the time Trump had recently returned from delivering a political speech in Iowa and that his motivation to look like a scrappy businessman was fueled by the failed presidential bid of Mitt Romney. \u201cHe felt that Romney had avoided looking successful,\u201d says Nunberg. \u201cRomney had posed beside a shopping cart in his jeans. Trump wanted to appear to be the opposite of that. He was proud of his business track record.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Trump-Originally-Wanted-To-Release-Tax-Returns Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
