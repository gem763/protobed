The misses were compounded by uncertainties surrounding the viability of its advertising revenue.\n\n\"Advertising markets remain short and volatile, and SCA will continue to focus on maximising its market share while maintaining strict cost control across all divisions,\" Southern Cross said in an announcement.\n\n\"Cost discipline remains a core focus, and a series of actions have been taken to mitigate full-year costs in response to adverse market conditions.\"\n\nAgain in the media industry, Nine Entertainment \u2013 the publisher of The Australian Financial Review \u2013 skidded 6.4 per cent to $1.75 per share as it sewed up its takeover of radio broadcaster Macquarie Media.\n\nThe new Nine subsidiary had noted its concern about \"subdued\" advertising revenue streams in August during its annual results.\n\nBut media companies weren't the only sector to find themselves in the firing line, with retailers also getting whacked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShares in furniture retailer Nick Scali shed 13.8 per cent to end Tuesday at $6.21 after the company advised the market of \"difficult trading conditions\" that would see its after-tax profit for the first half of the 2020 financial year come in $8 million short of where it was 12 months before.\n\n\"[Net profit after-tax] for the half-year ending 31 December, 2019, will be in the range of [$17 million to $19 million], compared to [$25 million] for the corresponding period in [the financial year 2019],\" the company said.\n\nInvestors also took the axe to Harvey Norman and JB Hi-Fi, where shares were down 5.9 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively.\n\nHarvey Norman finished at $3.97 and JB Hi-Fi at $33.06.\n\nMaterials take a dive\n\nGlobal developments, including the retreat of optimism around the US-China trade deal, also weighed on the market.\n\nThe partial deal initially boosted stocks on Monday before fading on Tuesday, with the materials sector, in particular, skidding 1 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBHP declined 1.2 per cent to $36.08, Rio Tinto was down 1.4 per cent to $90.60 and Fortescue Metals fell 3.5 per cent to $8.64.\n\nThe miners were accompanied on their slide by oil prices, with Brent down 0.8 per cent to $US58.89. Other commodities like gold, up 0.1 per cent to $1493.98 an ounce, and iron ore, up 0.1 per cent to $797.50 a tonne, travelled in the other direction.\n\nPositives for the share market included the aviation and infrastructure sectors.\n\nQantas Airways rose 2.9 per cent to $6.69, Sydney Airport climbed 2.2 per cent to $8.37, and Transurban advanced 1.1 per cent to $14.66.\n\nTechnology play Nearmap grew 5.9 per cent to $2.68 and telecommunications giant Telstra Corporation \u2013 which held its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday \u2013 rose 0.9 per cent to $3.54.", "description": "Australian shares were unable to capitalise on their positive start to the week, as a series of weak guidance statements from retailers and media companies dominated market news.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3367%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_895%2C$y_711/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8584ae83d39ed06c3a6eda6f8cdf5ada1223418e", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
