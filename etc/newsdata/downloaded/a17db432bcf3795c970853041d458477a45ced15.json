The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nOn Friday, the United Auto Workers voted to ratify its agreement with General Motors, bringing the nearly five-week-long strike to an end. Although it won some short-term pay increases and job protections for workers, the union failed to get GM to reopen the Lordstown, Ohio assembly plant and transmission plants in Warren, Michigan and Baltimore, Maryland. The union's inability to win big concessions from GM -- even after a prolonged strike -- shouldn't come as that big of a surprise. They were likely never possible in the first place.\n\nIn order to win substantial concessions, a union needs to bargain against a firm that has substantial market power and profits. This was GM in the 1950s and '60s, when the company by itself controlled nearly half of the US auto market. The GM of today is different.\n\nIt has continued to fall ever since. Despite its $11.8 billion profits in 2018, GM continues to have severe vulnerabilities. GM's 2018 market share is 16.6%, down from 23.2% in 2007, the last year before the Great Recession. By the time GM entered bankruptcy in 2009, it was already losing ground and its market share was down to nearly 19%.Ithas continued to fall ever since.\n\nThe company's loss of market share post-bankruptcy has left it with substantial excess production capacity and the fixed costs associated with maintaining those underutilized plants. This explains why the company was unwilling to budge on plant closures, such as the one in Lordstown\n\nrose nationwide from 6.8 million to 17.7 million over that period. But the vast majority of growth in the US auto market over the last 50-plus years benefited foreign automakers like Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Thus, GM finds itself in a weakened state compared to the heyday of the 1960s, when unions could use prolonged strikes to win generous concessions from the automaker. More disconcerting is that GM sold fewer cars in 2018 than it did in 1961, despite the US working age population rising by 103 million people over that time. Total vehicle salesrose nationwide from 6.8 million to 17.7 million over that period.
