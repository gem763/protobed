Three collegiate Hearthstone competitors were banned for six months each after holding up a sign that read \"Free Hong Kong, Boycott Blizz\" near the end of a livestreamed match.\n\nSuspicions of Chinese state influence on Blizzard exist because Activision Blizzard \u2013 Blizzard's parent company \u2013 is part-owned by Tencent, the Chinese tech conglomerate.\n\nFor its part, Blizzard has consistently denied that China has influenced any of its actions. In a statement on Blizzard's website published after the initial Chung ban, Blizzard's president J. Allen Brack wrote: \"I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision.\"\n\nNeither Mitsubishi nor Blizzard immediately responded to Business Insider's request for comment.", "description": "Mitsubishi Motors Taiwan reportedly dropped its sponsorship of Blizzard's esports events two days after pro esports competitor Chung Ng Wai was banned.", "authors": ["Charlie Wood"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c9f47138e4a4bd64bcc38?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
