In late June, the Iranians shot down a US Navy Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS-D) intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, specifically a RQ-4A Global Hawk high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drone.\n\nRead more: Iran just shot down one of the US military's most advanced drones \u2014 it costs more than an F-35 stealth fighter\n\nThe Trump administration, which walked away from the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal, has been much more aggressive in confronting Iran with a \"maximum pressure\" campaign that's battering its economy; the Trump administration says this is needed because Iran was secretly violating the nuclear deal that the US left in 2018, a positon that broke with all of the deal's signatories.\n\nThe RQ-4 incident nearly pushed the US and Iran into an armed conflict, as the US was preparing to retaliate with force. President Trump called off the attack at the last minute, arguing that a strike could kill dozens of Iranian people and stressing that such a response is \"not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.\"\n\nMattis' plan after Iran downed the RQ-170 appears to dismiss such concerns, as well as the possibility of escalating tensions with Iran.", "description": "Trump's ex-defense secretary wanted to lay a trap for Iran after it downed a US drone in 2011, but the Obama administration wouldn't go for it.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/58a4104001fe58c4018b4744-1334-667.jpg"}
