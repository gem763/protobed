supporting local economic drivers; accelerating land release and land development; investing in infrastructure for integrated human settlements, economic activity and the provision of basic services.\n\nThe development of rural and township economies will be prioritised to ensure that small business activities are supported and properly regulated.\n\nRegulations and bylaws will also be strengthened to encourage fair competition and prevent clashes between local small- and foreign owned businesses.\n\nThe intervention is also in line with the National Development Plan, which outlines the importance of building a capable state in partnership with the citizens of this country.\n\nThis requires well-run and effectively coordinated state institutions staffed by skilled public servants who are committed to the public good and capable of delivering consistently high-quality services for all South Africans.\n\nWe therefore call on all South Africans to play an active role in identifying problems and developing solutions in their areas.\n\nThose solutions and input will be incorporated into the plans that are aimed at growing the country.\n\nWilliams is the deputy director-general of the Government Communication and Information System", "description": "Less than four weeks ago, a new district development model that will revolutionise the way local government works and interacts for the benefit of South Africans was launched in Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape.", "authors": ["Phumla Williams"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8883/cf98ab52565545979d89e455b81fbecb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
