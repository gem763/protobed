It has the reflection of what appears to be a flash in the centre, suggesting the image may have been photographed from separate materials.\n\n\"The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran.

Commercial satellite images had previously been available following the rocket's explosion, showing smoke billowing from the pad that had recently been given a fresh coat of paint. Numerous vehicles had been spotted at the site in preparation for the launch attempt.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They have redacted part\" in the upper left corner.\n\n\"I don't think it was just Trump going rogue, it looks like it was a little bit more,\" Mr Hinz said. \"It was super unusual, and unlike other presidents, but it probably wasn't a complete rogue operation either.\"\n\nMr Trump has accused Iran of using its fledgeling space agency to further its efforts to launch ballistic missiles, which the US president has said is unacceptable. The issue has been of such import to the president that he pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear accord citing, in part, the country's ballistic missile tests.\n\nBut, experts say it is unlikely that a space exploration operation would be used to try and develop missile capacity, and that Iran is likely attempting to build out its space programme in an attempt to portray the nation as a leader of technology.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Apparently there have been reports that the third attempt to launch a satellite has been unsuccessful. Frankly, Nahid 1 is doing well, is in the laboratory, and reporters can come visit.\"", "description": "Donald Trump has tweeted what appears to be a new, high resolution image of the site of a failed Iranian satellite launch, claiming that the United States had nothing to do with the incident.
