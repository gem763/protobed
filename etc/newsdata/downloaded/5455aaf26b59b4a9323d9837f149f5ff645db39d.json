In a nationally representative survey conducted by the American Enterprise Institute, 18- to 35-year-olds who are lonely and socially active (it is possible to be both) choose to volunteer for political organizations and campaigns at seven times the rate of their peers who are not lonely (22% vs. 3%). Conversely, socially active young adults who are not lonely choose to volunteer for faith-based organizations at six times the rate as their lonely peers (24% vs. 4%).\n\nLonely, socially active young adults \u2014 defined as those who have multiple friends with whom they interact every week yet report high levels of loneliness \u2014 participate in nearly every type of political activity at considerably higher rates than those who are not lonely. This includes expressing support for a candidate on social media (51% vs. 33%) to displaying campaign posters and bumper stickers (30% vs. 18%). Ironically, the only activity in which non-lonely young adults outperform their lonely peers is in voting in elections. The lonely crowd is apparently better at telling others whom to vote for than actually getting to the polls themselves.\n\nPartisanship plays no role in this phenomenon. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, if you are young and socially active, your loneliness level is a better predictor than your political ideology of whether you will choose to get involved in politics instead of some other community-based activity.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ryan Streeter", "Realclearpolitics.Com Articles"], "top_image": ""}
