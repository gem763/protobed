Wait until you see what he\u2019s been up to in Turkey.

So who in Trump\u2019s inner circle has been lobbying for Turkey and what has the president done for them?\n\nWelcome to Rabbit Hole.\n\nTime is a flat circle: Way back in 2016, Mike Flynn wasn\u2019t yet formally Trump\u2019s national security adviser, nor had he been charged for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials. He was, however, just finishing up lobbying for the Turkish government and pressing the U.S. to deport a dissident cleric whom Turkey blamed for a 2016 coup attempt.", "description": "Trump\u2019s dealings in Turkey are yet another example of him allegedly rewarding his associates\u2019 private donors with official favors.", "authors": ["Adam Rawnsley"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571638900/191018-rawnsley-rabbithole-tease_rl1akk", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
