Here's what is actually going on.", "language": "en", "text": "A whistleblower complaint filed by a member of the intelligence community has sent shockwaves through Washington, as it reportedly accuses President Donald Trump of making an inappropriate promise to a foreign leader.\n\nThe details surrounding the complaint are still hazy, as the Trump administration is simultaneously denying the president did anything nefarious while working to ensure further information does not become public.\n\nRead more: 'DEFCON 1': US officials are rocked by a whistleblower complaint involving Trump's talks with a foreign leader\n\nThe acting director of national intelligence has refused to turn over the complaint, and his opacity has prompted yet another dramatic showdown between House Democrats and the Trump administration.\n\nThe mysterious ordeal is also linked to broader tensions between Trump and the intelligence community, and his tendency to defy presidential norms in a manner that could jeopardize national security.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nHere's what we don't know:\n\nWe don't know who the whistleblower is or what department or agency they're from \u2014 the CIA, NSA, FBI, etc. \u2014 and the ICIG is protecting their identity.\n\nWe don't know the precise details of the complaint or why it was of \"urgent concern.\"\n\nWe don't know if the whistleblower directly witnessed Trump making inappropriate pledges to a foreign leader or learned about the details via other channels.\n\nWhat Trump is saying:\n\nTrump has denied he said anything inappropriate and downplayed the significance of the allegations, and has sent out multiple tweets to that effect.\n\nTrump on September 20 said the whistleblower was \"highly partisan,\" providing no evidence to support the assertion.\n\nTrump later said he didn't know who the whistleblower was and defended his conversation with the unnamed foreign leader.\n\n\"I don't know the identity of the whistleblower. I just hear it's a partisan person, meaning it comes out from another party,\" Trump said. \"It was a totally appropriate conversation. It was actually a beautiful conversation.\"\n\nWhat Democratic leaders are saying:\n\nIn a statement on September 20, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: \"Reports of a reliable whistleblower complaint regarding the President's communications with a foreign leader raise grave, urgent concerns for our national security. We must be sure that the President and his Administration are conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President's personal interest ... The President and Acting DNI's stonewalling must end immediately, and the whistleblower must be provided with every protection guaranteed by the law to defend the integrity of our government and ensure accountability and trust.\"\n\nWhy this is such a big deal:\n\nIt's out of the ordinary for a member of the intelligence community to lodge a formal whistleblower complaint about a sitting president.\n\nThe unprecedented nature of the situation prompted a former CIA official to tell Insider it's \"equivalent to an imminent threat\" in the intelligence community, adding: \"DEFCON 1.\"\n\n\"To be in this line of work and then to file a formal complaint against the sitting president and the commander in chief based on something he said \u2014 something that was so deeply alarming \u2014 that's an impossible situation to be in,\" one FBI agent who works in counterintelligence told Insider.\n\nTrump has been at odds with the intelligence community from the start (he's often referred to it as part of the \"deep state\"), and his freewheeling approach to the presidency has been viewed by critics as a threat to national security.\n\nThis is yet another example of the Trump administration seeking to undermine Congress' oversight authority, which is an important part of the government's system of checks and balances.\n\nIf Trump and his allies have been working with a foreign government to influence the 2020 election, that's an extremely serious matter that would represent an assault on the electoral and democratic process in the US.\n\nWhat happens next?:", "description": "A member of the intelligence community filed a whistleblower complaint that reportedly has to do with a promise Trump made to a foreign leader.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger", "Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8515f62e22af610b5896c6-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
