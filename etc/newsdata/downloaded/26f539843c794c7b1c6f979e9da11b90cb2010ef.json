And four other big questions.", "language": "en", "text": "In 2012 a backbench Labour MP called Eric Joyce was enjoying a night of heavy drinking in the House of Commons. Late in the evening he declared that there were \u201ctoo many effing Tories\u201d in the bar and started a mass brawl, headbutting and punching fellow politicians before being restrained by four policemen who ultimately stuck him in the cells. This incident involving an MP being bad led to an internal Labour selection scandal, which in turn prompted a reform of the party, choosing a new leader. This aided the election of the lifelong Eurosceptic Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader - which some Remain campaigners blame for Brexit.\n\nJoyce said he is aware of the butterfly effect theory: \u201cI get it all the time. It's my great contribution to UK politics, to have been this terrible, depressing and destructive moment and I suppose if people try to keep their own narrative to understand how these things eventuated and how we ended up where we are then it's quite a tidy explanation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I reflect on it, I do think perhaps it's not too far to imagine a wee analogy you know with me completely disillusioned, lashing out pointlessly and self-harming and harming other people. With that eventually happening to the Labour Party and now with Brexit to the British public as a whole.\u201d", "description": "Is there a single moment that changed the entire direction of your life?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07mfqh3.jpg"}
