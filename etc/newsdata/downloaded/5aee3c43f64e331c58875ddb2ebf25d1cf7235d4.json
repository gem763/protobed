Investigators had been examining garbage pickups around Birmingham, Ala., and gone through around 12 tons of trash over the course of several days. Smith did not offer details as to why the police had zeroed in on trash and landfills.\n\nSmith said the police intend to obtain warrants for kidnapping and capital murder against 39-year-old Patrick Stallworth and his 29-year-old girlfriend, Derick Brown. The two had previously been questioned as part of the investigation.\n\nStallworth\u2019s lawyer did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Jefferson County Public Defender\u2019s Office, which represents Brown, said it has no comment at this time. Attorneys for both have previously said they are innocent and had no involvement in Kamille\u2019s kidnapping.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

AL.com reported that children at the party saw a man get out of an an SUV and put Kamille in a car.

According to AL.com, hundreds of false sightings of Kamille poured in as the city searched for the child. Local, state, and federal law enforcement were involved in the \u201cmassive\u201d search efforts. Governor Kay Ivey issued a statement and offered a $5,000 reward. Crimestoppers then offered a $20,000 reward.\n\n\u201cThere were a ton of people who were involved who wanted to see this young child come home,\u201d Smith said, thanking everyone who took part in the investigation. \u201cThis young child has touched the nation.\u201d\n\nMcKinney\u2019s parents, April Thomas and Dominic McKinney, had asked the public to help look for their daughter. Speaking out on local news channel WKRG5 on Oct. 5, Thomas had offered an emotional plea: \u201cJust bring my baby back, why did you choose her.\u201d\n\nGovernor Ivey tweeted her condolences Tuesday evening.\n\nBirmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin also offered his condolences to Kinney\u2019s grieving parents at Tuesday\u2019s press conference.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not in tears alone.
