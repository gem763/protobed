(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump said Wednesday that it would be \u201ceasy\u201d for the United States to form new alliances if Syrian Kurds leave the fight against the Islamic State to fend off a Turkish attack, noting that \u201cthey didn\u2019t help us in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t help us in Normandy\u201d and were only interested in fighting for \u201ctheir land.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all of that being said, we like the Kurds,\u201d he said in response to questions about Turkey\u2019s incursion into Syria.\n\nTrump\u2019s off-the-cuff remarks, following a White House ceremony where he signed unrelated executive orders, came as the administration continued an effort to correct what it has called the misimpression that Trump enabled the offensive against the U.S.-allied Kurds that Turkey launched Wednesday. The president spoke with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on Sunday.\n\nIn an earlier written statement, Trump urged Turkey to protect civilians and safeguard prisons where Islamic State fighters are being detained, saying the United States would hold its NATO ally responsible for the consequences of its decision to attack a key U.S. counterterrorism partner.\n\n[Turkey launches offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces]\n\nCalling the offensive \u201ca bad idea,\u201d he said in the statement that Turkey had promised to avert a humanitarian crisis and ensure its operation did not allow the Islamic State to regain strength.\n\nIn his impromptu news conference, Trump said he expected Erdogan to conduct the offensive \u201cin as humane a way as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to define that as we go along,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can do it in a soft manner, he can do it in a very tough manner. If he doesn\u2019t do it fairly, he\u2019s going to [pay] a very big economic price.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Trump said he would \u201cobliterate\u201d the Turkish economy if Erdogan misbehaved, although he did not define what would constitute bad behavior. But he has largely dismissed the fight between Turkey and the Kurds as the result of \u201ccenturies\u201d of hatred between them, indicating that the United States should not be involved.\n\nCongressional critics, including leading Republicans, have charged that the administration had abandoned the Kurds by pulling back between 50 and 100 troops from the Syria-Turkey border, where they served as a buffer.\n\nTrump announced Sunday night that Turkey \u201cwould soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria\u201d but that U.S. forces would not be involved and \u201cwill no longer be in the immediate area.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Defense Department and State Department officials have rushed to reassure other U.S. allies operating in Syria \u2014 principally France and Britain \u2014 that only a handful of U.S. troops were being moved and that the presence and mission of the total force of about 1,000 Americans in northern Syria would remain unchanged.\n\nFrance, whose foreign minister condemned \u201cthe unilateral operation launched by Turkey in Syria,\u201d called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Thursday morning.\n\nIn written statements and his White House remarks, Trump linked his decision to withdraw U.S. forces to his goal of ending the insurgent wars that have dominated the U.S. military\u2019s focus for two decades.\n\n\u201cThe worst mistake the United States has ever made, in my opinion,\u201d he said at the White House, \u201cwas going into\u201d the Middle East. \u201cWe\u2019re now acting as police,\u201d he said, \u201cdoing jobs that other countries should be doing.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans in Congress continued to warn that the Turkish assault was a threat to U.S. policy interests.\n\n\u201cA Turkish military advance into Syria threatens to halt momentum against ISIS, directly assaults our SDF partners, and could give the likes of al-Qaeda and Iran new footholds in the region,\u201d tweeted House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). He called on Turkey to \u201cstop immediately and continue to work with the US to secure the region.\u201d\n\nISIS is an acronym for the Islamic State. The SDF refers to the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish-dominated fighters who have been the principal U.S. allies on the ground against the militants.\n\n[Turkey announces start of offensive in northern Syria]\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), chair of the House Republican Conference, said the withdrawal decision was having \u201csickening and predictable consequences.\u201d In addition to sparking new Islamic State attacks, she said in a statement, \u201cthis decision aids America\u2019s adversaries, Russia, Iran and Turkey, and paves the way for a resurgence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nRep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said \u201cthe scene unfolding in Syria today is unacceptable. Turkey must immediately end its military operation, which has already resulted in civilian casualties.\u201d In a statement, McCaul said, \u201cI am working with my colleagues in the House to address this dynamic situation in a bipartisan way.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, most of whom had remained silent since the U.S. withdrawal was announced, began to surface their own criticism.\n\n[Read: Democratic lawmakers issue open letter to Trump on Syria]\n\nMore than 50 Democratic House members issued an open letter to Trump on Wednesday saying his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria in advance of the Turkish operation puts U.S. allies in danger, jeopardizes U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the region and will cause \u201ccurrent and future allies to question the reliability of the U.S. as a partner.\u201d\n\nThe signers of the letter represented a wide spectrum of political views within the party \u2014 with lawmakers on the left, moderates, combat veterans such as Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), who spearheaded the effort, and two former CIA officers, Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) and Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), who won in districts Trump carried in 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. military was closely monitoring events. Military officials said that Turkey was targeting mostly Kurdish military facilities and probably had destroyed some U.S.-provided military equipment. Another official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly, said some Turkish airstrikes had appeared to hit populated areas.\n\nThe official said the SDF had reduced its presence at the Islamic State prisons in Syria and at camps for displaced people that it controls. At the White House, Trump said that the United States had \u201ctaken a certain number of ISIS fighters that are particularly bad\u201d and relocated them but that he expected Turkey to take over control of any detention facilities abandoned by the Kurds, many of whom rushed to the front lines of the Turkish incursion.\n\nLater in the day, an official said all operations focused on the Islamic State in Syria had been halted at this time.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Turkey, a NATO member, had informed the alliance about its \u201congoing operation in Northern Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cI count on Turkey to act with restraint & ensure that the gains we have made in the fight against ISIS are not jeopardised,\u201d Stoltenberg said on Twitter. \u201cI will discuss this issue with President Erdogan Friday.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish operation was launched shortly after Russia also indicated it would not stand in the way. During a telephone call, Russian President Vladimir Putin sought and was given assurances by Erdogan that the offensive would not impede Russian efforts to resolve the wider Syrian war in partnership with Iran and Turkey, according to the Kremlin.\n\nThe situation raises questions for U.S. troops in Syria and Turkey.\n\nThe U.S. military established a combined joint operations center in Ankara several weeks ago to coordinate with Turkish forces on patrols in a \u201csecurity mechanism\u201d buffer zone in Syria separating the Kurds from Turkey. With Turkey turning away from that agreement, however, the U.S. troops at the center may be called on to instead monitor the Turkish operation and make sure U.S. troops stay out of harm\u2019s way, the U.S. officials said.\n\nIn a sign of Washington\u2019s disapproval, Turkish forces were removed from planned flights by the U.S.-led military coalition against the Islamic State in Syria, officials said. Turkish access to some intelligence and surveillance information also has been curtailed.\n\nLiz Sly in Beirut contributed to this report.", "description": "Democrats joined Republicans in criticizing the president\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria ahead of Turkey\u2019s incursion.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent", "Missy Ryan", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "Military Issues", "National Security", "Dan Lamothe", "The U.S. Military", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VtbNgKrVNBuKHO-bBcUbcjG8dpc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NHEZHCHK34I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
