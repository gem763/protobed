The money will be used to pay for Kim and Danny's funeral and a memorial.\n\nThe cash will also go towards supporting Maicee and Aveyja and hopefully give them a Christmas they deserve.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nDanny's cousin Bobby Johnson told Mirror Online: \"We're absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of people Danny and Kim's story has touched.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking thinking about the fact their two girls will have to grow up without their parents.\n\n\"Everyone wants to do their absolute best to make sure Maicee and Aveyja will be OK and well looked after.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's such a warm feeling knowing that people we've never even met are getting involved and helping out in any way they can.\n\n\"We just want to thank everyone from the bottom of our hearts who have donated and left their kind words of support.\"\n\nDanny's friend Ben Cook, who set up the fundraising page, has also told how the kindness of strangers has been a huge comfort to grief-stricken relatives.\n\nHe told the Mirror: \"The response has been fantastic, the family can\u2019t believe how many kind words and messages are being left.\n\n\"I set the page up in an emotional state and fear I may have underestimated the costs a little.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\"The aim is to cover the funeral costs, create a memorial like a bench or something, but mainly to support the children.\n\n\"Christmas is around the corner and I was hoping to raise enough to see them through the next few months and into the festive season.\"\n\nBen added: \"The couple meant so much to me and so many others. They\u2019ve helped people turn their lives around and helped others achieve life goals and dreams.\n\n\n\n\"Maicee is obviously distraught, but she\u2019s been solid as a rock and played a massive part in breaking the news to her younger sister Aveyja.\n\n\n\n\"I wish I could show the strength she is showing right now.\n\n\n\n\"She\u2019s a total credit to the couple, and I know Kim and Danny would be super proud of her.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The family of Kim Fletcher and Danny Johnson, from Stoke-on-Trent, are devastated their daughters will grow up without them", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20538180.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_081019Slug_10527JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
