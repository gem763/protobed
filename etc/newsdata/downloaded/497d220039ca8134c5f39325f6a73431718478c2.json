Companies are announcing layoffs and furloughs. Factory output is in the red.\n\nThe year-end outlook is grim, whipping up fears that as the global economy slows, Trump\u2019s trade wars with China and Europe \u2014 with tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods \u2014 could push the world\u2019s largest economy over the edge and into recession.\n\nMost worrisome for the president, as he prepares to fight for a second term next year, the picture is darkest in regions of the country that gave him his paper-thin margin of victory in 2016, despite losing the popular vote nationwide.\n\nThe White House, for its part, is having none of this talk.\n\nThroughout September \u2014 as job creation slowed, key indicators fell, consumer confidence waned and factories spun down \u2014 Trump attacked Democrats and the Federal Reserve, anything but his trade policy, while accusing the news media of \u201cbegging\u201d for a recession.\n\n\u201cThe PMI manufacturers\u2019 index has gone substantially up,\u201d Trump said during a September 25 news conference.\n\n\u201cOur country is the strongest it\u2019s ever been economically.\u201d\n\nNot so. In fact, the most closely watched gauge of American factories\u2019 health \u2014 the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index \u2014 had just fallen into the red in August for the first time in three years.\n\nAnd a week after Trump spoke, it fell to the lowest level since the Great Recession.\n\nTim Fiore, chair of the ISM manufacturing survey, told AFP the dropoff this year was the steepest in this century.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a nosedive,\u201d he said, warning that recession risks were mounting. \u201cI think if we stay below 50 for a couple more months, it\u2019s not going to feel very good.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Pain in Mercer County, PA \u2013\n\nAs of August, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Michigan had fewer people working in manufacturing than they did at the end of 2018, according to Labor Department data.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2016 margin of victory in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan \u2014 crucial battleground states \u2014 was fewer than 78,000 votes out of nearly 14 million cast.\n\nBut in an irate television appearance, Trump\u2019s senior trade advisor Peter Navarro accused the news media of \u201csinging some song\u201d about a weakening economy.\n\n\u201cThis Trump economy is strong as a rock. Manufacturing is strong as a rock,\u201d he said in a tirade on CNBC.\n\nHe said highlighting Pennsylvania\u2019s job losses was merely \u201ccherry-picking the data.\u201d\n\nBut there are quite a few cherries to pick.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards on September 30 blamed Trump\u2019s trade wars for the bankruptcy of Bayou Steel, which put nearly 400 people out of work.\n\nIn Michigan\u2019s Oceana County, where Republican support surged in the 2016 elections, a steel foundry operated by train manufacturer Wabtec announced last month it would close by the end of the year and lay off 61 workers due to \u201cdeclining business conditions.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the summer, Russian-operated NLMK USA steel mill laid off almost 100 employees in bellwether Mercer County, Pennsylvania, blaming Trump\u2019s tariffs on the imported steel slabs it processes.\n\nCongressman Mike Kelly, a Trump supporter, pleaded with the White House for help to no avail.\n\nMercer County gave Trump a major boost in 2016, with a surging Republican vote tally helping put him over the top statewide.\n\n\u2013 Red areas in the red \u2013\n\nAcross the nation, the manufacturing slump is hitting Republican counties hardest, according to data from the Brookings Institution. And in battleground states, the picture is even more stark.\n\nIn the Wisconsin and Michigan counties that Trump won, manufacturing accounts for about one in every five jobs. In the Democratic areas, it only accounts for about one in 10.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that the economy shapes political behavior \u2014 which it may not at this stage because we\u2019re so deep into the tribal stalemate \u2014 this slowing maybe inconvenient\u201d for Trump, said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings.\n\nOlive McKeithan, Democratic mayor of Farrell, Pennsylvania, home of the NLMK steel mill, told AFP the layoffs were a major blow to her city\u2019s voters and tax base.\n\nShe blamed Trump and his tariffs.\n\n\u201cEveryone who voted for No. 45, I hope they are happy,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Matthew McConnell, the Republican chairman of the Mercer County board of commissioners who is himself a former steel worker, said support for Trump was undiminished.\n\n\u201cIf you had the election today, you would have even larger support for Trump,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nChallenging China\u2019s unfair trade practices was a necessity, he added.\n\n\u201cHe had no ill will toward NLMK employees but, being a business guy, you sometimes have to make decisions for the betterment of the majority.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 After a brief surge during his first years in office, and despite his lofty promises, the American manufacturing rebound has", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/8cb9ba_elizabeth-warren-massachusetts-joins-striking-auto-workers-in-detroit-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
