Now, groups opposing pipelines are described with a new acronym, NOPE \u2014 which means \u2018not on planet Earth.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe need this industry to grow and that\u2019s where the rub comes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe stakes are high for the oil and gas industry. In order to meet even the most modest projections for growth, Canadian oil producers will need more than the 590,000-barrels-per-day Trans Mountain Expansion project, the 830,000-bpd Keystone XL pipeline and the 370,000 bpd Line 3 replacement project.\n\nThe Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers\u2019 most recent annual forecast projects the domestic oil industry will produce 5.86 million barrels of oil per day in 2035, up from 4.6 million bpd in 2018.\n\nThat\u2019s a more modest projection than the Canada Energy Regulator, which estimated Canadian oil production would reach 6.9 million bpd in 2040 in its base case but that could rise to 9.1 million bpd in a scenario where oil prices rise higher than expected.\n\nRight now, the Canadian oil industry produces more than can fit into its pipeline network. The most recent data from the CER shows that 310,000 barrels of oil per day were exported from Canada on railway cars in August, the last month for which data is available.\n\nCER data also shows the domestic oil industry will produce 4.7 million barrels per day at the end of this year. But that number is lower than the industry\u2019s production capacity as the government of Alberta has also imposed production limits on its largest companies to prop up prices. Alberta\u2019s production is capped at 3.81 million bpd for the last month of the year.\n\nAs it continues to make the case for more pipelines in Canada, CEPA released its annual pipeline performance report on Wednesday, which showed the total number of incidents such as spills, ruptures or cracks had held steady between 2017 and 2018 at 19 total incidents across the country\u2019s oil and gas pipeline networks. Those incidents released a total of 116 million cubic feet of natural gas into the atmosphere and 175 barrels of oil, of which 164 barrels were recovered.\n\nWith respect to emissions, the industry group says pipelines contribute to 1 per cent of Canada\u2019s total emissions. The upstream oil and gas industry contributes 22 per cent of the greenhouse gas emissions in the country.\n\nWhile the total number of incidents held steady, the report shows the number of \u201csignificant incidents\u201d increased from three to six. Five of the six incidents were on natural gas pipelines and the last big event was on an oil pipeline that caused 113 barrels to spill, all of which was recovered.\n\nCEPA defines a significant incident as a leak of more than 50 barrels of oil or other liquid hydrocarbon, an unintentional fire or a rupture of a pipeline.\n\nBloomer said that three of the significant incidents resulted from third-parties like contractors accidentally striking a pipeline, and added that the pipeline industry is focused on reducing those types of incidents.\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "Industry needs to reposition itself as groups opposing pipelines are described with a new acronym, NOPE \u2014 which means 'not on planet Earth'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/pipeline-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
