He has maintained that the company should not be in a position to moderate content, saying such a move could be \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitical ads on Facebook are more transparent than anywhere else,\u201d Zuckerberg said during a speech at Georgetown University earlier this month. \u201cWe don\u2019t fact-check political ads\u2026 because we believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.\"\n\nBut Warner pushed back against Zuckerberg\u2019s claims, saying that cable news has already set a precedent for how misinformation should be handled.\n\n\u201cWhile it is an imperfect process, there\u2019s already a precedent that operates on the basis of cable news for political candidate ads,\u201d he told Hill.TV. \u201cInstead they took the precedent set by broadcast TV, which has a different set of rules since they receive an FCC [Federal Communications Commission] license.\u201d\n\nCriticism of the Facebook policy mounted this month after the company allowed a Trump campaign ad to remain on the platform despite criticism that it made unfounded allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenWhite House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report Biden uses National Cat Day to fundraise for putting a 'pet back in White House' Sondland emerges as key target after Vindman testimony MORE, a Democratic presidential candidate.\n\n\u2014Tess Bonn", "description": "Sen.
