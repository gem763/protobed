I get less taxes but I don\u2019t support it.\u2019\n\nFelix and Marzia recently enjoyed a getaway to Japan (Picture: PewDiePie)\n\nHe reasoned: \u2018That\u2019s the good thing about Europe, you can travel to other countries and live there if you want to.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, after the star bought a house in Japan a few weeks ago (as you do), he also opened up about his plans to live there, at least for a little while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like we\u2019ve just got set up in the UK and now we\u2019re leaving,\u2019 he said, revealing that the couple are planning to stay in Tokyo.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll stay in Japan \u2013 it depends on tax and visas.\u2019\n\nPreviously revealing that he\u2019d bought a property over there, he told fans in a recent video: \u2018Hey, remember a while back when last time I was in Japan, and I was like \u201cI would really like to live here\u201d?\n\nThe star bought a new house in Japan \u2013 as you do (Picture: @itsmarziapie)\n\n\u2018Well, we bought a house here, yay! So we are just here for a couple of days setting up. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t have my whole set up and everything is terrible. I just wanted to say thank you, it\u2019s a dream come true!\u2019\n\nFelix and Marzia, who tied the knot earlier this year at London\u2019s Kew Gardens, got engaged in Japan back in 2018, with them going back to visit a whole host of times.\n\nMost recently, they\u2019ve been sharing gorgeous snaps of their holiday, from the markets and skyscrapers of Tokyo to art galleries and fireworks displays.\n\nApart from a pretty terrifying knife injury, they looked to be having a blast.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
