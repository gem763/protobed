REUTERS/Toby Melville/Pool\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has denied lying to Queen Elizabeth over the reasons for suspending parliament for five weeks after a court ruled his decision to do so was unlawful.\n\nParliament was prorogued - suspended - on Monday until Oct. 14, a move opposition lawmakers argued was designed to thwart their attempts to scrutinize his plans for leaving the European Union and to allow him to push through a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\nScotland\u2019s highest court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that the suspension was not lawful and was intended to stymie lawmakers, prompting Johnson\u2019s opponents to accuse him of lying to the queen as to the reasons for the suspension.\n\nJohnson said on Thursday those claims were \u201cabsolutely not\u201d true.\n\nWith seven weeks to go, the government and parliament are locked in conflict over the future of Brexit, with possible outcomes ranging from leaving without a deal to another referendum.\n\nJohnson said the government is waiting to hear an appeal next week against the Scottish court ruling by the Supreme Court, the United Kingdom\u2019s highest judicial body, and he respected the independence of the judges.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to quarrel or criticize the judges,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we respect the independence of the judiciary. They are learned people.\u201d\n\nHe said he was hopeful the government would reach a divorce deal with the EU next month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around the European capitals talking to our friends - I think we can see the rough area of a landing space, of how you could do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be hard, but I think we can get there.\u201d", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has denied lying to Queen Elizabeth over the reasons for suspending parliament for five weeks after a court ruled his decision to do so was unlawful.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429021201&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0NJ", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
