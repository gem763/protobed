According to an SEC filing also made public Friday, the company has acknowledged an additional probe into its practices from \u201cmore than half\u201d of the state attorneys general expected to be announced Monday, as the Washington Post reported earlier this week.\n\n\u201cThe DOJ has asked us to provide information about these past investigations, and we expect state attorneys general will ask similar questions,\u201d Google\u2019s senior vice president Tom Kent wrote in a blog post Friday. \u201cWe have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what that information entails, but it\u2019ll likely include documents and findings from the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s 2013 probe into Google\u2019s business practices over concerns that it was throttling the smartphone and online search advertising markets.\n\nBig tech companies have been facing increased scrutiny throughout this year as privacy scandals, in particular, continue to make headlines. Google\u2019s disclosure comes on the heels of news from earlier today that New York\u2019s attorney general plans to launch a multi-state antitrust probe into Facebook. The social media giant has also confirmed it\u2019s being investigated by both the FTC and the DOJ for antitrust violations. The FTC recently fined Facebook a record $US5 ($7) billion for privacy abuses linked to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a measure many Democrats denounced as a slap on the wrist.\n\nIn July, the Justice Department announced it was launching a probe into \u201cmarket-leading online platforms\u201d to review whether these companies \u201creduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\u201d The move came after months of deliberation between the DOJ and FTC, both of which possess antitrust powers, as the two coordinated which companies to investigate among the big names in tech such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.", "description": "The U.S. Department of Justice is mandating that Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, hand over any information regarding previous antitrust investigations into the tech giant, Google announced Friday....", "authors": ["David Nield", "Alex Cranz"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/nhs40pas0mn6h3ivtunw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
