The company has been expanding its portfolio beyond its flagship brand, with new products like Coca-Cola Coffee and Coca-Cola Energy in some markets.\n\n\"We were stuck in thinking that our category defined our opportunity, and that was a huge mistake because it got us fighting in minor leagues and focusing on the wrong opportunities,\" he said. \"There's huge area to grow across all beverages.\"\n\nCoke also started classifying its brands as explorer, challenger, and leader brands, depending on what stage they are on in their life cycles and their market caps, instead of looking at them all through the same lens. It has also started getting rid of brands that are a drain on resources and not growing.\n\n\"We had been treating a lot of the brands we had in our portfolio with the same logic and the same mindset as we did with Coca-Cola,\" he said. \"And that didn't work because they are in different stages of their life. They have different problems; they have different challenges.\"\n\nCoke has focused on healthier drinks and marketing tie-ups\n\nCoca-Cola has also tried to make sure its brands have strong attributes to give them an edge, Crespo said. Coca-Cola is all about optimism and uplifting people, he said, while Fairlife is a lactose-free milk whose value proposition is more protein, less sugar.\n\n\"Edge has to do with defining the space that you're going to own. At the end of the day, brands have a personality, brands have values, brands are built on a human truth,\" he said. \"If you are expanding your edge, you will be able to capture that in price and in profit.\"\n\nCrespo has also prioritized partnerships, resulting in limited-edition Coke bottles it created with \"Star Wars\" and a partnership with Marvel ahead of the premiere of \"Avengers: Endgame,\" featuring limited-edition Coke cans showing characters from the movie.\n\nCoke has also localized its approach. In China, Coke ran a competition with the e-commerce platform JD.com to provide young urban Chinese people with giveaways like movie tickets for their families around Chinese New Year. Its European rollout of Fuze tea included a bubble-tea version in the Netherlands.\n\nCoke says its bets are paying off in faster growth\n\n\"Getting a lot of countries to do stuff is super important, but allowing for them to find how they customize it is also a very important part of having a success,\" he said.\n\nSustainability has emerged as another priority for Coke, with the company pledging to make its packaging 100% recyclable by 2025. It is delivering on that by running ads that encourage people to recycle.\n\nThe company's bets are yielding results, Crespo said, with revenue growth jumping from low single digits to high single digits in the first half of 2019 versus a year ago and profit growth in the double digits. Coke is also rapidly gaining share across nonalcoholic beverages, he said.\n\n\"We have double the amount of experimentation year to date and over a quarter of our business coming from innovation,\" he said.", "description": "The company is expanding its portfolio with products like Coca-Cola Coffee and Coca-Cola Energy and focusing on tie-ins with pop cultural hits.", "authors": ["Tanya Dua"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8a62d62e22af0e6077aab8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
