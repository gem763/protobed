They name their side on Thursday and are waiting for fitness reports on their wing Cheslin Kolbe who aggravated an ankle injury against Japan last weekend.\n\nWales must be ready for blowtorch speed of South Africa, says Edwards Read more\n\nAsked if South Africa would consider spying on Wales to gain an advantage ahead of the semi-final, the coach Mzwandile Stick replied: \u201cWe are trying to keep the game clean as South Africans, led by World Rugby standards. Doing something like that is not part of what we stand for. We are an honest side. I do not think we will ever do something stupid like that.\n\n\u201cYou are not only fooling yourself but cheating the whole world. Supporters coming out here want a fair battle between two teams and that is what we always talk about. We do not need something like spying. We all have to play fair and square.\u201d\n\nWales are ranked by bookmakers as the outsiders to win the World Cup but Stick said the Springboks are preparing for them as they would had they been facing New Zealand or England: \u201cWe are expecting a tough battle, especially with their kicking game. They have got a lot of guys who have been around and they like to play for territory. They suffocate teams and do not allow them to come into their half. I do not think that in a week they will try to move away from their game.\n\n\u201cWhat will be key for us is turning every opportunity we get into points, especially when we get into their 22. We knew the biggest challenge in the quarter-final was containing Japan who look to keep the ball in hand. Now it is a different beast: Wales will give you the ball with their massive kicks, forcing you to play from inside your own half. We have to come up with a plan to get into their half.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s back-row Francois Louw dismissed the odds being offered by bookmakers on Wales who have not lost a competitive match since February\u2019s Six Nations defeat to Ireland in Dublin. \u201cThey are there to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way we are taking Wales lightly. They have been playing consistently well for a number of years, won the [Six Nations] grand slam earlier this year and were top of the world rankings for a few hours or days.\n\n\u201cThey are a fantastic outfit, a highly organised, structured side in which players wholeheartedly believe in their systems. They have a very effective defence and while they had a close call against France in the quarter-final, they will take a lot from that. It is play-off rugby. Anything can happen.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nMeanwhile, England defence coach John Mitchell has insisted he \u201cdoesn\u2019t see any advantage\u201d in opponents spying on training sessions.\n\n\u201cIf that is what they want to do, and that is the way they want to prepare, good luck to them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just happened to be training where there are apartments above our tiny two-metre fence, so I am not sure about what the use of the tarpaulins are.\n\n\u201cThe facilities have been excellent but it\u2019s an area where people live and there is the odd red light around. There was one up in the corner, which was a bit suspicious. It doesn\u2019t really worry me. This game is so dynamic now so I don\u2019t see any advantage in spying on a team.\u201d", "description": "Coach Mzwandile Stick said the Springboks are \u2018an honest side\u2019 and \u2018expect a tough battle\u2019 against Wales in the Rugby World Cup semi-final", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c6b91b438d6506593ee08ee10d76ba26987fe24/738_121_3797_2278/master/3797.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4de5de70b6df4b77a4bca4b4dda72eff", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
