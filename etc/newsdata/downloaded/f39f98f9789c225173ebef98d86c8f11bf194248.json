(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)\n\nIn the wake of reports that Hillary Clinton is considering making a late entry into the 2020 presidential race, Senate Democrats are warning her against it, saying the party has moved on.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s done a great service to our country and public service, and I supported her wholeheartedly, but I believe it\u2019s time for another nominee,\u201d Senate minority whip Dick Durbin said, according to a Politico report.\n\nSenator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico called the move a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nSenator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, generally the most conservative Senate Democrat, said, \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d when asked about a possible Clinton 2020 run.\n\nThe senators\u2019 expressions of doubt come after longtime Clinton adviser Philippe Reines said earlier this week that the former secretary of state has not ruled out running in 2020 and would consider doing so if she thought she had the best odds of beating President Trump.\n\n\u201cThere might be a reason that she\u2019d be the best person, not only to beat Donald Trump, but to govern after Donald Trump, which is a part we don\u2019t talk about much,\u201d Reines said. \u201cYou can make fun of her all you want, but 65 million people voted for her and that\u2019s second more to anyone except Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nEstablishment Democratic donors have also reportedly been musing about what the 2020 race would look like if Clinton jumped in at the eleventh hour.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know whether the world has passed on or not,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein of California wondered. \u201cI\u2019m a friend of hers and I\u2019m extraordinarily fond of her. But that\u2019s a factor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just my instinct that there\u2019s no way she wants to go through this meat grinder again,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut remarked.\n\nSenator Doug Jones of Alabama, Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Senator Tammy Duckworth, and Senator Jon Tester of Montana also expressed doubts about a Clinton run.\n\nClinton even fanned the rumors herself earlier this month when she shot back at a tweet from President Trump prodding her to enter the race with, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job.\u201d\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren and former vice president Joe Biden currently lead the crowded Democratic primary field of candidates.", "description": "\u201cI supported her wholeheartedly, but I believe it\u2019s time for another nominee,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Ilya Shapiro", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Kevin D.
