Offering customers their choice in programming, without schedules and without commercials, the content streaming space promises to change the way audiences watch TV.\n\nThe niche has long been the exclusive province of Netflix (NFLX), but this fall both Apple (AAPL) and Disney (DIS) will enter the arena. All three stocks are already showing the effects of the coming competition, as the companies jockey to retain, or to gain, position. We\u2019ve looked into TipRanks\u2019 database, to find out what Wall Street\u2019s top analysts have to say about these companies, and their positions relative to each other.\n\nNetflix, Inc.\n\nThe incumbent in the streaming space, Netflix (NFLX \u2013 Get Report) should have all the advantages. The company was the early adopter in the field, shifting to streaming after online video technology eclipsed its original DVD-by-mail business. Netflix has used its incumbency well, building a large subscriber base and prioritizing content creation to develop a library of over 400 original programs.\n\nBut come November, Netflix will face direct competition from strong players. Both Apple and Disney will undercut the company on subscription fees (more below), Netflix will be hard-pressed to maintain user loyalty. The challenge comes after the company reported disappointing subscription rates in the second quarter. The 2.7 million net adds were far short of the 5 million forecast, and the US market, Netflix\u2019s core, declined by 100,000. And behind this, lies the brutal fact that Netflix has built its proprietary content library by spending over $15 billion annually, with an additional $2.9 billion on marketing. While the company is not quite in the red (fiscal 2019 revenues are estimated at $20 billion), it cannot keep increasing the cost of content creation indefinitely. These doubts lie behind the stock\u2019s shaky performance; NFLX has turned negative for the year, registering a 4.8% loss in share price year-to-date.\n\nEven Netflix\u2019s bulls are growing cautious in this environment. Jeffrey Wlodarczak, writing from Pivotal, reiterated his buy rating but cut far back on his price target \u2013 from $515 to $350. He says, \u201cAs competition heats up, the right move for Netflix is to increase its spending materially to keep its lead in terms of content. That will temporarily pressure margins and free cash flow, postponing the day when Netflix turns in big profits.\u201d\n\nDespite his acknowledgement that Netflix will have to swallow losses in order to remain competitive on content creation, Wlodarczak remains bullish on the stock for the long term. He adds, \u201cOur new forecasts imply they are going to respond to content cost acceleration by revving up their own content spend that will allow them to maintain their subscriber growth while pushing back profitability materially.\u201d Wlodarczak\u2019s new price target still gives NFLX an impressive upside of 37%.\n\n5-star analyst Andy Hargreaves, of KeyBanc, is also cautious on NFLX. He rates the stock a hold, and says, \u201cThe decline in Netflix since Q2 has priced in significant competitive concerns and makes us more positive overall, but only a significant beat with strong growth in mobile plans seems capable of addressing competitive concerns, while a miss could impair bullish views. Without strong evidence to provide confidence in upside potential, we continue to view the short-term risk/reward as neutral.\u201d\n\nEven with top analysts growing reluctant to commit to NFLX, the stock maintains a Strong Buy from the consensus. Shares are selling for $254, and the average price target of $401 indicates confidence in a robust 57% upside potential. The long-term trend for this stock will ride on 2H19 subscription numbers \u2013 if Netflix can increase its audience in the face of competition, it will have the resources to avoid operating in the red.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Online content-on-demand is the hot new thing in entertainment.
