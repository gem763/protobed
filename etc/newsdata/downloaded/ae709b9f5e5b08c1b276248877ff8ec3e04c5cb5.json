The bird continues to lunge at the deer\n\nBut then the deer reappears with a friend, so again turkey launches forward and the two deer are sent scurrying away.\n\nMoments later, five deer are seen grazing and the turkey still persists on intimidating despite being outnumbered.\n\nDespite being outnumbered by the white-tailed deer, the turkey persists on following it and jumping in its face, in the clip uploaded on October 23. Turkeys will act aggressively if they feel an animal lower than them them in the pecking order\n\nLandreth, who is part of the West Tennessee Deer Hunters group, posted the video to Facebook with the caption: 'This turkey doesn\u2019t like to play reindeer games, lol!!'\n\nPeople have been quick to share their witty responses to the turkey who appears to be throwing its weight around in Bolivar.\n\nOne viewer, Tracye Diane Simmons wrote: 'Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the roost!!!'\n\nCorey Birmingham added: 'Great video!!! She was cocky this morning.'\n\nAccording to the Massachusetts state website, wild turkey aggression can be linked to establishing dominance in their flock: 'Wild turkeys live in flocks organized by \"pecking order\".'\n\nTurkey's will act aggressively if they feel an animal they have encountered is lower than them them in that pecking order.\n\nEach bird is dominant over or 'pecks on' birds of lesser social status.\n\nWild turkeys can fly up to 55 miles per hour and run up to 25 miles per hour.", "description": "A wild turkey was filmed jumping into the faces of grazing deer to get them to back off in Bolivar, west Tennessee, on October 23.", "authors": ["Phoebe Eckersley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/10/20271846-0-image-a-42_1572257910079.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
