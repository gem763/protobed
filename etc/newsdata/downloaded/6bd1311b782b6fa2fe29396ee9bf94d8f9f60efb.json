Against a basket of currencies it hit a month low of 97.898 overnight and strengthened very slightly on Thursday.\n\nThe Norwegian crown weakened to an all-time low of 10.1800 against the euro. Some analysts blame the currency's recent weakness on global trade jitters, while others said the speed and magnitude of the drop were hard to explain. Asian trade, the biggest gainer was the Australian dollar AUD=D3 , which rose 0.3% to $0.6780 after jobs data showed buoyant hiring, reducing chances of monetary easing in November.\n\n\"This is just what the doctor ordered,\" said CommSec Chief Economist Craig James. \"There is no reason for the Reserve Bank to cut rates again in November \u2013 giving (it)... more time to gauge the effectiveness of early rate reductions.\"\n\nLingering worries about trade tensions between the United States and China kept a lid on gains for most trade-exposed currencies, though.\n\nNegotiators are working on nailing down text for the first phase of the trade deal for their presidents to sign next month, but details are scarce. if a deal is signed, it remains uncertain if the obligations can be fully met on both sides,\" strategists at Singapore's DBS Bank said in a note.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 fell marginally to sit at $0.6287, not far from a four-year low hit two weeks ago.\n\nChina's yuan weakened slightly to 7.0990 per dollar, while the safe-haven Swiss franc rose 0.1% to 0.9936 per dollar.", "description": "FOREX-Pound slides as Brexit uncertainty deepens; dollar steadies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE7E039_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
