The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable.\n\n\"We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\"\n\nGillis' casting came under scrutiny just hours after SNL announced he would be one of three new hires for the show's 45th season.\n\nA podcast from September 2018 was circulated in which Mr Gillis mocked Chinese people and described his remarks as \"nice racism\".\n\nIn another episode from the same month, Mr Gillis was heard using homophobic slurs to describe Hollywood producer Judd Apatow and comedian Chris Gethard.\n\nGillis defended the comments on Twitter saying he is a comedian \"who pushes boundaries\". He continued: \"My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\"\n\nShortly after the recordings circulated, Good Good Comedy Theatre in Philadelphia, Gillis' hometown, said on Twitter the club had \"deliberately chosen not to work\" with him because of his \"overt racism, sexism, homophobia - expressed both on and off stage\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @goodgoodcomedy We, like many, were very quickly disgusted by Shane Gillis' overt racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia - expressed both on and off stage - upon working with him years ago. We've deliberately chosen not to work with him in the years since. \u2014 Good Good Comedy Theatre (@goodgoodcomedy) September 13, 2019 Report\n\nComedian Rob Schneider, a regular on SNL in the 1990s, tweeted his support for Gillis, saying he had fallen foul of \"culture unforgiveness\".\n\nFellow comics Bill Burr and Jim Jeffries also criticised SNL's decision while appearing on the US series Lights Out with David Spade.\n\nJeffries said the move was just a symptom of \"cancel culture\". He said: \"The guy shouldn't have been fired. It's just a couple of things back in his history - are we going to to go through everyone's history? Or are we going to get every sketch that SNL has done that involves race?\"\n\nBurr added: \"Did they go back and also try and look back at good things the person might have done, or are they just looking for the bad stuff?\n\n\"You could do that to anybody. I don't get it. Millennials - you're a bunch of rats. None of them care; all they want to do is get people in trouble.\"\n\nIn addition to Gillis, SNL had announced the hiring of two other new cast members: Chloe Fineman and Bowen Yang.\n\nYang will be the show's first full-time Chinese-American cast member.", "description": "Gillis apologised for the remarks saying he was a comedian \"who pushes boundaries\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C62D/production/_108833705_gettyimages-1157500069.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
