The Department of Homeland Security was considering labeling fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction earlier this year.\n\nU.S. officials claim China is the main source of illicit fentanyl that is trafficked into the U.S. Stopping shipment of the drug from China to the U.S. has been a focal point of conversation for President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping as the two world leaders attempt to hash out a trade deal.\n\nTrump has even called on major package carriers FedEx, UPS and Amazon to \"search for & refuse\" packages from China that contain the drug.\n\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, in a separate interview on \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday blasted Beijing for its alleged role in the shipment of the illicit drug. He said fentanyl has been so dire for Americans that he raised the issue with senior officials.\n\n\"China for years has been sending us this poison through the mail system,\" Portman said. \"They've done little to stop that, and they have the power to do that.\"\n\nPortman said even now, U.S. officials don't have the information required on shipments coming into the country to identify illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances. \"It's one of the irritants in the relationship\" between the U.S. and China, he said.", "description": "\"There's a huge reorganization going on in China regarding fentanyl to try to shut it down,\" Blackstone co-founder Stephen Schwarzman says.", "authors": ["Berkeley Lovelace Jr.", "Matthew J.
