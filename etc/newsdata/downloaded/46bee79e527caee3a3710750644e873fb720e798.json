After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this.\u201d\n\nBA says it has offered pilots a pay rise of 11.5% over three years but the union says its members want a bigger share of the company\u2019s profits.\n\nThe union accuses BA of making massive profits at the expense of workers who made sacrifices during hard times. A further strike is penciled in for Sept. 27.\n\nUnion leader Brian Strutton said pilots are determined to be heard.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve previously taken big pay cuts to help the company through hard times. Now BA is making billions of pounds of profit, its pilots have made a fair, reasonable and affordable claim for pay and benefits.\u201d\n\nBA operates up to 850 flights a day. The company said it understands the frustration of passengers affected by the strike.\n\nLondon\u2019s sprawling Heathrow Airport will be the most impacted by the work stoppage as it is BA\u2019s major hub and used for many of the company\u2019s long-haul international flights.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "British Airways says it has had to cancel almost all flights as a result of a pilots' 48-hour strike over pay.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gregory Katz"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/britain_ba_strike_77779_c135-0-3714-2087_s1770x1032.jpg?1f31d0009722bab7b43d47ec8340235a9f8b030d", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
