It's a little bit harsh, but that's the way it goes sometimes.\n\nIt's a fantastic job and Phil is a very lucky person in my opinion.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThey've got great support, and for me the only way is up for them. They won't be getting any worse, they've hit rock bottom and come through it, so they're only improving.\n\nThey'll have every chance in the future because they have a massive fanbase, and that's what you want nowadays. With the FFP rules, you need a big fanbase and not just a rich owner to be able to invest and do well.\n\nSunderland have that support and infrastructure, so it's a tremendous opportunity.\n\n(Image: Ian Horrocks)\n\nUnorthodox Reading approach could pay off\n\nReading have appointed their next manager, and it's pretty unusual, with Mark Bowen moving into the dugout from his role as director of football.\n\nI don't think I've seen anything like that before, but nothing surprises me in football these days, and why not?\n\nIf you've been an assistant manager, a coach and a director of football, why not take the job yourself and see how you do?\n\nHe's obviously stepping up and putting himself in the firing line. Not too many directors of football get sacked, do they? But he's taken the reigns himself and I suppose it's the next progression for him given his background.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nJust because it's unusual, doesn't mean it can't be a success. The only thing I'm wondering is if he interviewed himself!\n\nIt's a club that wants to do well with a fantastic stadium, fantastic training setup. He obviously knows the club really well, so we'll have to wait and see.\n\nIt's a very unusual thing, but only football can throw these scenarios up and that's why it's always so interesting.\n\nFormer club Millwall poses big challenge\n\nIt's a shame to see Neil Harris leave my former club, Millwall, because I thought he did a brilliant job to be honest.\n\nObviously he was a fantastic player for them, but he came in as manager, got them promoted again and kept them in the Championship.\n\nThey're mid-table and not doing too badly at the moment, but he felt he needed to leave which is a bit disappointing really.\n\nAs I say, he did a fantastic job there in my opinion and it's a shame he clearly felt he'd taken the club as far as he could.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt's a new challenge for someone else. The chairman, John Berylson, is an excellent guy so I wish them all the best in their choice.\n\nWho is it going to be? I have no idea. Normally the bookies know what they're talking about, and Gareth Ainsworth is the favourite at the moment with a few other names in the mix.\n\nIt's a big challenge for whoever takes over to get them towards the top of that table given some of the teams in the division, but I wish them all the best.\n\n(Image: Quest)\n\n* The EFL's 'Goals Worth Talking about' aims to use the power of football to encourage conversation about our mental health.\n\nTo find out more about the EFL and Mind's campaign visit: https://www.efl.com/onyourside", "description": "In this week's EFL column, EFL on Quest pundit Ian Holloway discusses three recent managerial changes in the Football League", "authors": ["Ian Holloway", "Image", "Getty Images", "Ian Horrocks", "Empics Sport", "Quest"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20601712.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Ian-Holloway.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
