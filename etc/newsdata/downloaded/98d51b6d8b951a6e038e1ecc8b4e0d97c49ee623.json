Mandatory Credit: Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports\n\nYelich, the National League\u2019s reigning MVP, was lost for the season on Tuesday with a fractured kneecap. However, that hasn\u2019t stopped the Brewers, who have won seven straight contests, including a four-game sweep of the Marlins.\n\nMilwaukee remains tied with the Chicago Cubs for the second National League wild-card position. Both teams are four games behind the first-place St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Central.\n\nReliever Freddy Peralta (6-3) earned the win by pitching two scoreless innings and striking out three.

The Padres scored in the ninth and had the winning run at the plate when Wick fanned Luis Urias to end the game with the bases loaded.\n\nIan Happ delivered a two-out, two-run single in the fourth inning for the Cubs, who won for just the second time in seven games.\n\nCardinals 10, Rockies 3\n\nDexter Fowler and Kolten Wong started the game with consecutive home runs, and St. Louis also got leadoff homers in the second, third and fourth innings en route to a victory over Colorado in Denver.\n\nRangel Ravelo, Marcell Ozuna and Harrison Bader went deep, and Fowler, Wong and Andrew Knizner had two hits apiece for the Cardinals, who salvaged the finale of a three-game series. Paul DeJong and Wong each had two stolen bases.\n\nNolan Arenado homered and finished with two hits, Josh Fuentes hit his first major league home run, and Garrett Hampson had two hits for the Rockies.\n\nMets 11, Diamondbacks 1\n\nJuan Lagares had the biggest game of his major league career, homering twice and finishing with six RBIs as New York completed a four-game sweep of visiting Arizona.\n\nThe Mets outscored the Diamondbacks by a 20-1 margin in the final two games and 26-4 overall to leapfrog Arizona, which began the series 2 1/2 games ahead of New York, in the gaggle of National League teams pursuing a wild card.\n\nLagares produced his first career two-homer game, and he doubled his previous single-game career RBI high. Todd Frazier added his third homer in two days.\n\nYankees 10, Tigers 4 (Game 1)\n\nLuke Voit had three hits, including a two-run homer, scored three runs and drove in three as New York won the first game of a doubleheader in Detroit.\n\nEdwin Encarnacion also ripped a two-run homer for the Yankees. He came out for a pinch hitter in the seventh, with the team saying he had a left oblique strain. Encarnacion will return to New York for further testing.\n\nYankees slugger Aaron Judge reached base four times and scored four runs.

CC Sabathia, back from the injured list, started and allowed two runs in 3 1/3 innings. Aroldis Chapman got the last two outs for his 37th save.\n\nPutting a damper on the sweep, Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez exited in the fourth inning due to left groin tightness, an inning after he was caught trying to steal a base. Sanchez was out July 24-Aug. 9 because of a left groin strain.\n\nRoyals 6, White Sox 3\n\nHunter Dozier stroked a tiebreaking three-run homer in the sixth inning to lead Kansas City to a win at Chicago.\n\nJorge Soler went 2-for-4 with a solo home run and two runs while Dozier added a double for the Royals, who won for the fourth time in six games. Kansas City captured the last two games of the three-game series.\n\nRoyals starter Jorge Lopez (4-7) allowed three runs, two earned, on eight hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked two and struck out two.\n\nPirates 4, Giants 2\n\nPittsburgh used triples from Cole Tucker and starting pitcher Joe Musgrove to build a lead, then got a home run from Jacob Stallings as insurance in a win at San Francisco.\n\nMusgrove (10-12) pitched five shutout innings, and Felipe Vazquez recorded his third save in four days, allowing the Pirates to take three of four in the series.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 first two batters in the ninth inning reached base, but Vazquez rebounded to strike out pinch hitter Austin Slater and Mike Yastrzemski before getting Buster Posey to ground out for his 28th save.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Ryan Braun, wearing injured teammate Christian Yelich's jersey under his own as a tribute, slugged a go-ahead, two-run homer to lead the Milwaukee Brewers to a 3-2 win over the host Miami Marlins on Thursday afternoon.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429259255&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C03L-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
