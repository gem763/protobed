However, he is still expecting a bloodbath.\n\nKnight and Lobov will run back the most famous fight in the brief history of Bare Knuckle FC on Nov. 16 at Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi, Miss. Their first match in April was a barnburner of brutality with both men leaving the ring covered in cuts and blood.\n\nLobov won the decision, but Knight has felt from the final bell of that initial contest that he deserved to get his hand raised. His goal is to make things more definitive this time around.\n\n\u201cI really felt like I won the first fight, now I\u2019ve got my opportunity to go prove it and try to knock him out this time so that (expletive) don\u2019t go to the judges,\u201d Knight told MMA Junkie. \u201cI want to make Artem look like a fool, even though I kind of like the guy.\u201d\n\nLobov said in the immediate aftermath of Bare Knuckle FC 5 earlier this year that he would be willing to face Knight again in the future. \u201cThe Russian Hammer\u201d defeated the former boxing champ Paulie Malignaggi to stay unbeaten in bare-knuckle competition before the rematch came to fruition.\n\nKnight said he didn\u2019t question if Lobov would give him the opportunity to fight again. He just wasn\u2019t sure if the Bare Knuckle FC brass would agree.\n\n\u201cI never doubted that Artem himself would give me the rematch,\u201d Knight said. \u201cHe seems to be a real cool guy and a man of his word. I never doubted for one second that if Artem was given the rematch he wouldn\u2019t take it. But I was worried Bare Knuckle wouldn\u2019t make it happen. We\u2019re going to see if his chin can hold up this time.\u201d\n\nKnight admits he \u201cunderestimated\u201d Lobov going into their first meeting. He also admitted to getting overly brawl-happy and not giving much thought to offensive or defensive strategy. That\u2019s typically the way Knight fights, but he said he intends to reel it in for the Lobov rematch.\n\n\u201cLast fight I felt like I had way better skills than Artem does and way better technique,\u201d Knight said. \u201cI got hit a time or two and said, \u2018(Expletive) it\u2019 and bit down on my mouthpiece and was trying to knock him out without thinking about how I was going to do it or how to strategically beat him. In this fight I need to keep it in my head to fight smart and not just go out there and brawl with him and then I can make it an easy fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go out there and I\u2019m going to bleed and he\u2019s going to bleed, but this time I\u2019m going to keep my hands up a little more, get my footwork a little more and try to use a little bit of head movement. The fans want to see us get down and get blood and dirty, but I\u2019m going to try to knock him out.\u201d\n\nIf Knight succeeds with his plan of winning the rematch, he\u2019s already offering up a trilogy. Lobov has afforded that opportunity at Bare Knuckle FC 9, and Knight will return the honor.\n\n\u201cArtem said he would have enough respect to give me my rematch, so of course I\u2019m going to give him his rematch,\u201d Knight said. \u201cI would never try to hold that from a guy.
