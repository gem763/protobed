The ECB leaders promised to keep these measures in force, \"until we see that the inflation prospects are stably in line\" with reaching the target level.\n\nEconomists believe that despite the comprehensive measures taken in September, the ECB still has room for maneuver and for further stimulating the European economy, which shows clear signs of a slowdown.\n\nIn general, the long-term negative dynamics of remains, which speaks in favor of sales of this currency pair.\n\nThe breakdown of the short-term support level of 1.0965 will signal a resumption of sales with the immediate goal at the local support level of 1.0900. Breakdown of this support level\n\nwill provoke a deeper decline and will direct EUR / USD towards 1.0850, 1.0800.\n\nIn an alternative scenario and in case of breakdown of the short-term resistance level of 1.1015 (\u0415\u041c\u0410200 on the 4-hour chart), EUR / USD will go towards the resistance levels of 1.1040 (\u0415\u041c\u041050 on the daily chart), 1.1090, 1.1115 (September highs, May - April lows). Growth above this resistance level is unlikely.\n\nMeanwhile, traders are preparing to the publishing at 18:00 (GMT) the minutes from the September meeting of the Fed and they are selling the dollar.\n\nUnexpected information contained in the protocols can increase volatility in the financial markets. The soft rhetoric of the statements contained in the minutes will have a negative effect on the dollar. And, on the contrary, the \u201chawkish\u201d position of the Fed leadership will support the dollar.\n\nInvestors will also follow the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech in Kansas City, which will begin at 15:00 (GMT).\n\nDespite the fact that market participants expect the Fed to at its meeting on Oct. 29-30 by 0.25% with a probability of almost 80%, the dollar will remain attractive in the context of international trade wars and a slowdown in the global economy. Against the general background, the U.S. economy looks more stable, which determines the attractiveness of American assets and the demand for the dollar.\n\nSupport Levels: 1.0965, 1.0900, 1.0850\n\nResistance Levels: 1.1000, 1.1015, 1.1040, 1.1090, 1.1115\n\nTrading Recommendations\n\nSell \u200b\u200bStop 1.0950.
