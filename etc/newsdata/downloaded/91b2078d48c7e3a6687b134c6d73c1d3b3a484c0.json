REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez\n\nEarlier this year, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in a bid to fund his promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe emergency declaration allows the Trump administration to use money from the military construction budget and the Pentagon has said it could use $3.6 billion from the budget.\n\nIn March, the Pentagon provided Congress with a broad list of projects that could be affected, but did not provide details.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pentagon officials said 127 would be impacted and the first $1.8 billion would come from deferred military construction projects outside the United States. The second tranche would come from deferred military projects inside the United States, the officials said.\n\nElaine McCusker, the deputy under secretary of defense comptroller, said construction could begin as early as within 100 days on land owned by the Defense Department, like the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range in Arizona.\n\nThere are currently more than 4,500 active duty and National Guard troops on the border.\n\nLieutenant General Andrew Poppas, director of operations at the Joint Staff, said he expected that building the wall would reduce the number of troops needed on the border.\n\nTrump made the border wall a major 2016 campaign promise. The wall, which critics have called a political stunt, is part of his hardline immigration policies that are central to his 2020 re-election bid.\n\n\u201cDepartment of Defense components and military departments provided input and prioritized projects based on affects on readiness and consistency with the national defense strategy,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.\n\nHoffman added that lawmakers were being notified of the decision, after which the specific projects affected would be released.\n\nThe announcement was criticized by Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThis decision will harm already planned, important projects intended to support our service members at military installations in New York, across the United States, and around the world,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the decision would undermine national security and \u201cthe quality of life and morale of our troops, making America less secure.\u201d", "description": "More than 120 U.S. military construction projects will be adversely affected as the Pentagon prepares to use $3.6 billion to help build or enhance 175 miles (282 km) of the border wall with Mexico, U.S. officials said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Idrees Ali", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425922588&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8223U"}
