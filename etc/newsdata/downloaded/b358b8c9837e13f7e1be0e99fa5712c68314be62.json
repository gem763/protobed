Glady Berejiklian told Sky News the NSW government \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe either legalising drugs, or introducing pill testing is going to prevent deaths\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t support it and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right path to go down,\u201d she said. Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the premier should be open to the recommendation because \u201cyoung people are losing their lives: and the government needs to \u201clisten to health experts\u201d. Ms Berejiklian will in the meantime move to reinstate a controversial 'festival safety system' after coming under pressure to allow pill testing. She will reintroduce legislation to state parliament, which would force organisers to prepare safety management plans for high-risk events. Under the plan, a licensing fee would be waived for low-risk festivals but others would be forced to pay-up and cover the costs of police and paramedics who are called in to help.", "description": "Watch the Latest News.com.au Videos including Featured News Videos and Sports Videos and News Highlights.
