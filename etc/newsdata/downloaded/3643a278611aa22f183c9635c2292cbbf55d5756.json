The composite new business index fell to 48.7 from 50.5.\n\nAs growth stalled, services firms cut back on hiring plans. The employment index fell to 53.0 from 53.2, its lowest since January.", "description": "Euro zone business growth stalled in September: PMI", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF920IO_L.jpg"}
