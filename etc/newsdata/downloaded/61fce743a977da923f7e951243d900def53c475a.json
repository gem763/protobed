If the so called \u201ctax gap\u201d for individual taxpayers had been completely closed in 2018-19, Mr Klug said, ATO figures suggest the federal budget would have been in surplus by $8 billion.\n\nLate last year, the Board wrote to 6000 tax agents who had not filed tax returns for themselves or owed tax debts.\n\n\u201c[We] saw in a space of only six weeks \u2013 as a result of one letter \u2013 some 2000 agents voluntarily paid almost $40 million in tax debt and updated around 6000 lodgements.\u201d\n\nThe move by the Board to seek a wider role in overseeing tax accountants, replacing smaller industry bodies to reduce the compliance burden, comes as former deputy chair of the Board of Taxation, Keith James, and former president of the Tax Institute, Neil Earle, are finalising an independent review of the Board and the Tax Agent Services Act.\n\nMr Klug said the review supports a recommendation from the Hayne royal commission that information sharing between agencies should be formalised through legislation to make it mandatory rather than discretionary.\n\nThe review also suggests expanding the Board register with further details of tax practitioners, including detailed reasons for any sanctions or terminations, reasons for rejections of renewal, and a list of known unregistered providers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a new strategic direction, a renewed energy and a common goal to work towards \u2013 which is protecting consumers and ethical practitioners by strengthening the Board as an efficient and effective regulator,\u201d Mr Klug said.\n\nThe Board is pressing for wider disciplinary powers as it focuses on the 2.5 per cent of tax agents labelled high risk. This was \u201ca group that has significant leverage, often as the drivers or initiators of illegal tax schemes.\n\n\u201cTax practitioners who are involved in the black economy and related activities such as phoenixing are clearly at the more extreme end of the misconduct scale.\n\n\u201cAt the pointy end are those advisers involved in tax crime, evasion or avoidance. And in the middle is a graduated mix of practitioners who display low-to-high risk behaviours.\u201d", "description": "The Tax Practitioners Board is aggressively targeting 2000 accountants, TPB chairman Ian Klug said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3362%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1ae28486d95cc45ea605cdda014f802083bdedf3", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
