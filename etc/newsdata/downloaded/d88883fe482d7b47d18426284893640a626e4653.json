(Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Miami Dolphins are the consensus choice to be the NFL\u2019s worst team, and they looked the part Sunday. They couldn\u2019t run, couldn\u2019t pass, couldn\u2019t tackle. And worse yet, the Dolphins want to be bad this year \u2014 tanking is their rebuilding strategy. Maybe they\u2019ll be generationally bad.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be fair \u2014 maybe Lamar Jackson will be generationally great.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJackson was one of the early monsters in Week 1, rolling up 33.56 fantasy points and beating all the other early-wave quarterbacks. And the shocking thing was that he did it with his arm, not his legs. Jackson threw for 324 yards and five touchdowns in the 59-10 beatdown of Miami, while he ran just three times for six yards (meanwhile, his teammates rumbled 43 times for 259 yards).\n\nBaltimore had 42 points at halftime, clicking on a handful of shot plays. And it all looked so easy, so cohesive. So fun.\n\nIt\u2019s never easy to tell how much of a blowout is the good side being legit versus the bad side being terrible. But Jackson and the Ravens passing game could be a breakout show. Rookie Marquise Brown lived up to his Hollywood billing, premiering with a tasty 4-147-2 line, with both scores from distance. Mark Andrews (8-108-1) scored in garbage time (from Robert Griffin, in fact), but he nonetheless looks terrific. I\u2019ll admit I looked at this passing game all summer and had questions \u2014 how much would the Ravens throw? How passer-developed is Jackson anyway? Now I\u2019m forced to re-evaluate.\n\nThe only disappointing Baltimore thing was the play of the understudy running backs; when a match gets out of hand, often the backups run wild. While Mark Ingram answered the bell early (14-107-2), Gus Edwards (17-56) and Justice Hill (7-27) were underwhelming. It\u2019s just one game, but it was disappointing to see.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s not much to say about Miami\u2019s offense. Ryan Fitzpatrick never really had a chance (14-for-29, 185 yards, one touchdown, one pick). Rookie Preston Williams had a nice touchdown grab. Albert Wilson got hurt. DeVante Parker needed seven targets to get there, but he did have a 49-yard catch and 75 yards overall. Josh Rosen took off his tennis sweater and threw three late passes, one of them picked. Miami fans might be wearing bags over their heads before the end of the month.\n\nNo rest for the Dolphins, as they host New England (and a different cat named Brown) next week. Meanwhile, Jackson and the Ravens throw down (or run down) with Kyler Murray and the Cardinals.\n\nBeware the Fantasy Obstructors\n\nRookie receivers got the best of it on Sunday, while the first-year backs weren\u2019t as exciting. But sometimes these things are more about gridlock than they are about talent lock.\n\nConsider players like Frank Gore and Darren Sproles \u2014 respectable veterans, but no longer fantasy staples. These days, I consider them Fantasy Obstructors. They\u2019re good enough (or respected enough) to still command a share of the touches, but not good enough to be started in most fantasy teams. Basically what they do is get in the way of players we want to use for fantasy.\n\nPerhaps Devin Singletary will nudge Gore out of the way soon. Singletary made 98 yards on his nine opportunities Sunday \u2014 sparking a classic Bills comeback or Jets choke, take your pick \u2014 while Gore was stuck at 11-20 on the ground. I\u2019m all for Gore as an elder statesman and role model, but at some point talent should win out. Singletary should be rostered in even shallow leagues. (Of course, he also has to deal with Josh Allen taking some rushing production \u2014 Allen scampered, recklessly at times, for 38 yards and a score.)\n\nLike Gore, Sproles is 36 \u2014 they were born about a month apart in the spring of 1983. And like Gore, Sproles got plenty of work Sunday, though he was more effective. Sproles rolled up 47 yards on nine carries in the comeback win against Washington, along with three short catches (16 yards). This usage got in the way of rookie Miles Sanders, who had to settle for 11-25 rushing, along with a two-yard reception. (Sanders also lost a 21-yard touchdown on a tacky-tack holding penalty.)\n\nWe worried about the width of Philadelphia\u2019s usage tree all summer, and it came to roost here \u2014 five different players carried the ball, and eight different players had multiple targets. DeSean Jackson (8-154-2) was the star of the game, but we know he\u2019ll have quiet days, too. Carson Wentz was sloppy in the first half \u2014 the entire team was \u2014 but he was letter-perfect in the second, finishing with 313 yards and three touchdowns. He\u2019s still the safest bet in this offense.\n\nIf I had to bet this second, I\u2019d take Singletary over Sanders. But much better days are ahead for both players, and I think they have good chances to be difference-makers in the 2019 fantasy season.\n\nEverybody loses in Jacksonville\n\nHistory will note Kansas City\u2019s 40-26 victory in Week 1, but this game had more losers than winners. Myles Jack lost his mind, leading to a first-half ejection. The Jaguars lost QB Nick Foles to a broken collarbone. Tyreek Hill doesn\u2019t need surgery on his collarbone, but he\u2019ll reportedly be out multiple weeks.\n\nAnd to put a wrap on this lost day, Jacksonville\u2019s stadium lost power in the middle of the second half. The final third of this game was not televised. Maybe it\u2019s the ending we deserved.\n\nSammy Watkins scored early and often, en route to a blowup game (9-198-3). Now the challenge is to prove he can be a star performer regularly, even with teams scheming against him (and not dealing with Hill). Some will push Watkins into the WR1 conversation while Hill is out, but I wonder if you can sell off that optimism and make a profit. Let\u2019s not forget how injury-prone Watkins has been for most of his career, and how erratic his play has tended to be. If I rostered him, I\u2019d at least make it known that he was available; see how the market reacts.\n\nPatrick Mahomes managers are glad the game ended; that Jags defense is physical and it\u2019s also, to put it kindly, aggressive. This game felt like a three-hour bar fight. LeSean McCoy outplayed Damien Williams, though Williams cashed a short touchdown. Travis Kelce did Kelce things.
