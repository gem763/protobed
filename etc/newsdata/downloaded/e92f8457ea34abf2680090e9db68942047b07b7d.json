However when sisters Iqra (Priya Davdra) and Habiba (Rukku Nahar) arrived on Albert Square, it was soon revealed that Adam and Habiba had been interested in each other for a very long time, which led to an affair storyline between the two of them.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say Honey had been in denial that Adam and Habiba were having an affair. After Billy saw them kissing, he confronted Honey about it but she continued to gloss over everything. Honey asked Adam if the rumours about him and Habiba were true, but he denied everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Honey\u2019s demeanour changing over the last few weeks, it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s struggling to come to terms with Adam\u2019s betrayal. But is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nShe\u2019s planning revenge\n\nHoney definitely knows there is evidence to suggest that Adam and Habiba have been seeing each other, she knows about Billy seeing the two of them kiss, and she also saw CCTV footage from the Minute Mart of Adam stroking Habiba\u2019s hair, but Adam\u2019s sweet talking and gift buying has meant Honey is yet to fully confront Adam about his sleazy behaviour. Could Honey be planning to get revenge on Adam so people can finally see that the dentist with the perfect smile isn\u2019t so perfect after all?\n\nShe\u2019s planning to run away\n\nWith actress Emma Barton currently spending her weekends on Strictly Come Dancing, a short-term exit could be on the cards for Honey. If she doesn\u2019t confront Adam about the affair, could she run away from Walford leaving him to put two and two together? We have seen Habiba try to convince Honey that she is better off with someone else, will she finally realise this and flee Albert Square?\n\nShe\u2019s pushing Adam away deliberately\n\nWe have seen Honey struggle to accept that Adam hasn\u2019t been trustworthy, if she continues to struggle with accepting Adam\u2019s lies, could she deliberately push Adam away so he leaves her to make the inevitable confrontation a little easier?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe\u2019s developing an eating disorder\n\nRecent episodes saw Honey have dinner with Adam, Iqra, Habiba, Mariam (Indira Joshi) and Arshad (Madhav Sharma). In what seemed like a perfectly normal dinner (besides the fact that Adam was having an affair with Habiba but you know, minor details!), Honey seemed reluctant to try the dishes that had been prepared. After anxiously excusing herself to go to the bathroom, Adam realised when Honey returned that she had also brushed her teeth. Remembering how Honey was before the dinner, viewers started to become concerned and thought that Honey could be developing an eating disorder.\n\nWith Honey saying to Habiba: \u2018when you\u2019ve had as many knocks as I\u2019ve had, looking in the mirror simply isn\u2019t important anymore\u2019 and her self esteem at a low as she compares herself to Habiba \u2013 could she be hiding an upsetting and dangerous secret?\n\nEating disorder charity Beat said: \u2018Low self-esteem, along with many other possible factors, may put someone at a higher risk of developing an eating disorder.\u2019\n\nEating Disorders - the statistics It is estimated that 1.25 million people in the UK have an eating disorder\n\nAnorexia has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness\n\nStudies suggest that up to 25% of people with eating disorders could be male\n\nSome symptoms of bulimia \u2013 irritability, disappearing during or soon after eating, mood swings\n\nSome symptoms of anorexia \u2013 eating very slowly, missing meals, avoiding eating with other people\n\nSome symptoms of binge eating disorder \u2013 social withdrawal, eating very rapidly, buying lots of food\n\nThere is no doubt Honey certainly has something on her mind right now, but what it could be is yet to be revealed. What we do know is that Honey potentially feels like she doesn\u2019t have anyone she can talk to right now. Could she talk to Billy or will her pride get in the way? How far will things go before someone realises something is wrong? Will Honey be in serious danger by the time someone does?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find more information and support in relation to eating disorders by visiting Beat\u2019s website.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "She is hiding a troubling secret.", "authors": ["Calli Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18660786-low_res-eastenders-october-december-2019-f6c6_1571070125.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
