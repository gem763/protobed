For almost seven years talk has bubbled of the Queensland government offering a second licence, and Star has previously warned that spending on the Gold Coast would be dependent on the competitor landscape.\n\nStill, the government this year sought registrations of interest about the second casino.\n\nStar on Thursday offered to commit to a long-flagged $2 billion masterplan for its existing casino, which includes new towers, a $100 million investment in the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre, and refreshing its Sheraton Grand Mirage resort.\n\nIt was commensurate on there only being one casino, because the city was too small for two, Mr O\u2019Neill said.\n\nWe're saying we'll ... make this investment, if we get exclusivity. So, there is no threat. \u2014 Matt Bekier, CEO, Star Entertainment\n\nStar chief executive Matt Bekier dismissed the suggestion this constituted a threat.\n\n\u201cThis is a constructive proposal we take to government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're saying we'll ... make this investment if we get exclusivity. So, there is no threat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Bekier bristled at suggestions the move would get the government\u2019s hackles up. \u201cI know you\u2019re waiting for a fight, and you will celebrate that \u2026 we will not.''\n\nInvestor demands\n\nInvestors strongly backed resolutions at the meeting, but several criticised problems they perceived with how operations were run, from problems with loyalty cards to glitches with systems.\n\n\u201cStar has been given a valuable monopoly in area, but is penny-pinching its way to having that [Gold Coast] monopoly broken down with the entry of new casinos,\u201d said shareholder Ian Timmins.\n\n\u201cStar doesn\u2019t consider the ramifications of its decisions on the paying public, then wonders why many people would like to see a second casino on the coast.\u201d\n\nMr Timmins complained he had raised issues with the board previously but they were not acted on. His comments were applauded by shareholders.\n\nMr Bekier said a loyalty card points system would be changed.\n\nStar said domestic revenue from July to October was up 1.5 per cent compared to a year earlier, with growth in both Sydney and Queensland. Front money from international VIPs was flat.\n\nMr Bekier said trade tensions had affected some Chinese business for the past 18 months. \u201cWhile we still see good visitation numbers, the spend per visitor is down. And we saw that last year.''\n\nAmid allegations hitting Crown of money laundering by some customers, Mr Bekier maintained that Star\u2019s compliance scorecard has been very good.\n\nHe also dismissed questions about the limited use of the word casino in messaging for its proposed Brisbane development. \u201cI really don\u2019t see that that\u2019s a relevant topic,\u201d he said.", "description": "Star Entertainment vows to spend $2 billion on upgradng its existing Gold Coast casino if no rival gaming operation is allowed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4a4f61463446dafc031d2bd6a291e7a7b290407b", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
