It was commissioned by Norman and Aimee Lykes and last renovated in 1994.\n\nThe 3,095-square-foot (288-square-meter) property in the city\u2019s Biltmore neighborhood has three bedrooms, three baths and is nestled on the edge of a mountain preserve. The buyer also gets all the original mid-century modern furnishings.\n\nOfficials with the auction house say they were looking for a bidder who would invest in maintaining the integrity of the home.\n\nWright\u2019s influence can be seen across Phoenix. The lauded architect had a hand in designing the Arizona Biltmore resort, just a few miles from the Lykes House.\n\nHe is mostly known in the Southwest for creating his winter home and architecture school, Taliesin West, in 1937 in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale. Taliesin West remains popular with guided tours and presentations. It was one of eight Wright buildings added to UNESCO World Heritage list in July.\n\nAnother Phoenix home Wright designed for his son and daughter-in-law remains on the market. Constructed in 1952, the David and Gladys Wright House is currently listed at nearly $10 million. The owner of the spiral-shaped house had wanted to turn it into a museum and event space. But neighbors in the upscale Arcadia neighborhood complained about possible traffic.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An Arizona house that was the last home architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed before his death sold Wednesday for nearly $1.7 million.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Terry Tang"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/wright_house-auction_78468_c0-212-5084-3177_s1200x700.jpg?cb39760d6785ad7dd780d66e11531b10fe71d926", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
