He\u2019s improving and improving.\n\n\u201cIn his first start, he finished really well in the last 400m \u2013 it was the fastest time of the race. Last time Karis tried to find cover but he couldn\u2019t, so he went early. He learned a really good lesson.\n\n\u201cJoao asked for the ride [on Wednesday night], I was happy for him to ride the horse. I knew Not Usual Talent would be hard to beat, but with 15 pounds difference, I thought he would run well. He did \u2013 he\u2019s really improving.\u201d\n\nThe win was the first of a double for Moreira, who also tasted success aboard Peter Ho Leung\u2019s in-form Le Terroir.\n\nAfter just a fair start to his career (he was winless after 10 starts) the gelding has really hit his straps in the last six months, rattling off four victories from his past five runs.\n\nNow a four-year-old, it looks as though Le Terroir can continue to climb up the ratings.\n\n\u201cHe improved a lot after his last run \u2013 physically and mentally. He put on 26 pounds \u2013 which I didn\u2019t expect. After the last one, his mind is open \u2013 he wants to race,\u201d said Ho, who also enjoyed a win with Very Rich Man.\n\nLe Terroir does it again! Joao Moreira secures a double as Peter Ho's charge lands his fourth win from his last five starts! #HappyWednesday #HKracing pic.twitter.com/s3JnymXPN5 \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cLuckily he had a good draw and he showed his ability. He still had a couple of lengths in hand.\n\n\u201cI hope we can stay in the class again, but it depends on the handicapper. It would be unfair for the owner if they put him up \u2013 you can\u2019t expect him just to have two runs [in Class Three] and put him up to Class Two.\u201d\n\nThe shock of the night came in the last race when Speedy King just stuck his nose in front of the fast-finishing Super Turbo at $51.50 in the Class Two Ivictory Handicap (1,200m).\n\nThe pace was hot early when Speed Vision and odds-on favourite Yee Cheong Baby went toe-to-toe, setting it up for a horse running on.\n\nIt suited the Ricky Yiu Poon-fai-trained Speedy King perfectly with Alberto Sanna lifting him over the line.\n\n\u201cIncredible. He\u2019s an incredible horse \u2013 so honest,\u201d a beaming Yiu said afterwards.\n\n\u201cI said to the jockey \u2018don\u2019t underestimate him, even if he\u2019s in fourth or fifth position, just take your time, he\u2019ll run for you\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had seven wins now and I think four or five of them have been by a small margin \u2013 he just knows how to win.\u201d\n\nIt's a double for @Albe_Sanna and a double for Ricky Yiu as Speedy King springs an upset in the last! \ufe0f #HappyWednesday #HKracing pic.twitter.com/81UWDNEJ5j \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 23, 2019\n\nIt completed a double for the Yiu-Sanna combination after they won with After Me earlier in the night.\n\nChris So Wai-yin was the other trainer to leave with a double from the card as Wonderful Tiger (Karis Teetan) and Happy Time (Zac Purton) scored.\n\nMeanwhile, Dylan Mo Hin-tung copped a two-meeting suspension and a HK$10,000 fine for his win aboard Very Rich Man in the fifth race.", "description": "Trainer Danny Shum Chap-shing might have found his BMW Hong Kong Derby contender for this season after promising youngster Playa Del Puente saluted at Happy Valley on Wednesday night....", "authors": ["Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/23/4cbce6bc-f59f-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_234241.JPG?itok=P46PERPa&v=1571845366", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
