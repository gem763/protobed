There are so many to choose from.\"\n\nHe teased the audience with fragments of Opportunities and Rent before the unmistakable synth riff for Go West chimed out - prompting another mass singalong, with some fans even donning the video's unforgettable conical hats.\n\nThe set ended with a snatch of 2016's The Pop Kids, a song that acts as a potted history of the band: \"We were young but we imagined we were so sophisticated / Telling everyone we knew that rock was overrated.\"\n\nWith rock all but edged out of the charts, and artists like Charli XCX, Billie Eilish, and Years & Years building on the Pet Shop Boys' pop template, it's no surprise Chris Lowe was smiling: The gig felt like a lap of honour and a pop masterclass rolled into one.\n\nSetlist\n\nSuburbia\n\nBurn\n\nSe a vida \u00e9 (That's the Way Life Is)\n\nWest End Girls\n\nDreamland (with Olly Alexander)\n\nVocal\n\nHeart\n\nIt's A Sin\n\nLeft to My Own Devices\n\nGo West\n\nDomino Dancing\n\nWhat Have I Done to Deserve This?

The list goes on.\n\nSpeaking backstage, Sarah and Keren revealed that the last time they'd been in Hyde Park it was as fans, watching Barbra Streisand's comeback show earlier this summer.\n\n\"Actually, the first song we ever recorded was Evergreen by Barbara Streisand, on a cassette player when we were at school,\" Keren recalled.\n\nSadly, though, this pivotal moment in pop history has been lost in the mists of time.\n\n\"I've got loads of old cassettes but my brother tended to record over most of them. Bruno Brookes doing the Top 40 and that sort of thing,\" said Keren.\n\nSo how about recreating the cover for their next album?\n\n\"A disco version?\" asks the singer. \"I've just tried to imagine it in my head and... maybe not.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bananarama perform Venus at Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park 2019\n\nFrancis Rossi had a gruelling training regime\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nStatus Quo were one of the day's biggest hits - with hundreds of fans beerily recreating the hands-on-hips swivel dance for Down Down; followed by a rousing singalong to Rockin' All Over The World.\n\nFrontman Francis Rossi seemed decades younger than his 70 years as he strutted around the stage - but that sort of athleticism doesn't come easy.\n\n\"I like to be match fit, so I had to swim double this morning to try to get myself ready,\" he said in his dressing room, as he limbered up his fingers on a spring-loaded grip strengthener.\n\n\"I ate at 11:30 this morning because I like to leave six hours between a meal and a show; and I do a few crunches, because that helps pop the chest and the diaphragm, for some reason.\"\n\nWho said rock stars have an easy life?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Status Quo - Rockin' All Over the World\n\nKelsea Ballerini premiered a brand new song\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nUS country star Kelsea Ballerini took the opportunity to play her recent single, Homecoming Queen, as well as premiering Better Luck Next Time, a spunky break-up song that'll feature on her upcoming third album, due early next year.\n\nSo was she nervous about playing untested material to 40,000 people? Not especially.\n\n\"I think this is probably an audience that I'll have to introduce myself to, anyway,\" she said modestly before the show.\n\n\"I'm prepared for none of them to know any of my songs - so it takes the pressure off of the one actual new song when all of them are seemingly new.\"\n\nClean Bandit have been working in China\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFresh from the success of composing Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello's Senorita, Clean Bandit have been off to China, where they've been writing with two up-and-coming stars Henry Lau, and Tia Ray.\n\nTravelling to Shanghai was a bit of an eye-opener for the band.\n\n\"We were really shocked at the studios we got taken to out there,\" said Jack Patterson. \"They were phenomenal, you don't see new studios being built like that anywhere else in the world. It's a different level of investment in the music industry.\"\n\nThe band did encounter a few difficulties, though, with messaging services like WhatsApp banned in China.\n\n\"We were like, 'Why isn't anyone replying? Do they hate us?'\" said cellist Grace Chatto.\n\n\"In the end, we had to use a special app.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the band revealed that work had started on their third album, which could herald a change of direction.\n\n\"There are quite a few songs that we're working on finishing now that are more towards a hip-hop tempo and style,\" said Grace.\n\n\"That's kind of solidifying as a plan over the last couple of weeks.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Clean Bandit perform Rockabye at Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park 2019\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
