That was higher than the 450,000 tonnes sought by bears but much lower than the 650,000 forecast by bulls.\n\nAnother statistic that did not help the bulls: China\u2019s purchase of just 6,500 tonnes.\n\nWhile Chinese demand for corn and other animal feed has been anemic in recent months due to its epic loss of herd from the African Swine Fever, traders have been keeping up hopes that Beijing will take more of the grain from the U.S. after the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of the trade deal announced by the White House on Oct. 11.\n\nTrump said the partial deal included China agreeing to raise U.S. agricultural purchases to between $40 billion and $50 billion from $8 billion to $16 billion. China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He has since clarified that while progress was made, more talks were needed. The U.S. grains exports data confirmed just that: corn had yet to benefit.\n\nThe last time Chinese importers booked their largest U.S. corn purchase was in March, when they bought about 300,000 tonnes for the 2018/19 marketing year. That was the highest volume in at least 5\u00bd years.\n\nSome Say Corn Technically Overbought, Weather Turning For Good\n\nThere could be two other reasons now for the market\u2019s pullback\u2014technically overbought levels and forecasts for drier weather.\n\nJeff Kaprelian, a grains analyst at The Hueber Report in St Charles, Illinois, said on Monday there was at least one school of thought going around that \u201conce we get through the next few days, there will be a wide-open harvest window that should allow for rapid catch up.\u201d\n\nCorn 300-Min Chart\n\nAt around $3.86 per bushel, December corn is 3.7% down from a week ago, when it hit three-month highs of above $4.01. Prior to that, it had a blistering five-week rally on fears that wet, cold weather will do much of the crop in. Without a recovery in the coming days, the market is likely to post a second straight week of losses.\n\nThursday\u2019s crop progress report for corn from the U.S. Department of Agriculture had many stats that seemed positive for the grain.\n\nWith freezing temperatures, heavy snowfall, and high winds hitting the northern Plains, the corn in North Dakota was only 4% harvested.\n\nSouth Dakota corn farmers have picked 9%, while Minnesota farmers have completed just 11% of their harvest.\n\nIowa farmers have only 15% of their corn out of the fields, while Illinois and Indiana growers\u2019 activity ranks in the 30s\u2019 percentile range.\n\nEven so, Kaprelian noted, overall crop conditions rose by one point to 56% of the good/excellent status. The market had expected a one-point decline instead.\n\nInvesting.com\u2019s Daily Technical Outlook has a \u201cSell\u201d recommendation on December corn, projecting support as low as $3.775 per bushel in the near-term.\n\nOthers Say Technicals Show Room For Rally\n\nBut Todd Hubbs, writing in the Successful Farming blog on Monday, placed a far greater bet on a corn price outbreak:\n\n\u201cOver the last two marketing years, the central Illinois corn basis appreciated around 16\u00a2 from mid-October to the end of February.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the projections for corn consumption and ending stocks currently in place from USDA hold, any price appreciation over the next few months would result from a strengthening basis.\u201d\n\nMike Seery of Seery Futures in Plainfield, Illinois, had a cheery outlook as well, noting that December corn was trading above the 20-day moving average but still below their 100-DMA.\n\nSeery added:\n\n\u201cVolatility remains very low and that, generally, is the case during harvest as we will bring nearly 14 billion bushels onto the market. So stay long, and continue to place the proper stop loss as the risk/reward is in your favor.\u201d", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Barani Krishnan/Investing.com covering: US Corn Futures.
