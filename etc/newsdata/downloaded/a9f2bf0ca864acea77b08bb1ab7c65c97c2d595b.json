United blew the chance to win at Wolves and that 1-1 draw was followed by a chastening 2-1 home loss to Crystal Palace last weekend.\n\nSaturday\u2019s trip to Southampton was another winless match for the Reds, who saw Daniel James\u2019 brilliant opener cancelled out by Jannik Vestergaard. Even Kevin Danso\u2019s second-half dismissal for the hosts could not inspire United, who have five points from their opening four matches following that 1-1 draw.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I think we have to come to these kind of games and win and come back to Manchester with three points or the feeling is frustration and two points dropped again.\n\n\u201cWhen you score the first goal and you have the ball and you seem that you are having the tempo of the game, you need to kill (it off) and score the second goal and then the game is more or less done.\u201d\n\nThose comments echoed Solskjaer\u2019s sentiments and Mata knows they need to up their game.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I think we are deserving more in almost every game but deserving is not enough: you have to get it.\u201d\n\nUnited are yet to hit their straps but at least they know exciting talent James is able to handle top-flight football. A low-key summer arrival from Swansea, the 21-year-old proved to be a thorn in Saints\u2019 side and scored a stunning strike that took his Premier League tally to three goals \u2013 as many as Alexis Sanchez could manage for United.\n\n\u201c(It was a) very good goal, a fantastic finish,\u201d Mata told MUTV. \u201cHe\u2019s a very hard-working player. He gave us a lot on the wing and even in the second half when everyone was a bit tired, he was still sprinting and giving very dangerous crosses.\n\n\u201c(I\u2019m) very happy for him and hopefully he can do it many more times. Football is easier right, if you are that quick? He takes advantage of that. He goes one against one and it\u2019s very difficult for a defender to take the ball off him. We need to use him even more.\u201d\n\nSaints rode their luck at times but defended well on the whole, with Vestergaard impressing at the back and scoring an impressive leveller.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very happy with a point,\u201d the centre-back said. \u201cI think we deserved it already against Liverpool, when we didn\u2019t get it, but today we were rewarded for the hard work we put in. It was our game plan to go out there and shake them a little bit \u2013 make them uneasy \u2013 because when they get comfortable, they\u2019re obviously very good and have world-class players.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Juan Mata is frustrated that Manchester United keep falling short due to a lack of killer instinct.
