Critics on Twitter called the piece \u201cpro-segregation\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d and pointed to the fact that Hill graduated from Michigan State University, which is not an HBCU.\n\nHill left ESPN in 2018 after making waves as a frequent critic of President Trump. On Twitter, she called the president a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d and a \u201cbigot\u201d who was \"unqualified and unfit to be president.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nESPN initially declined to punish her for the tweet but then sidelined her for two weeks in October 2017, after she violated the company\u2019s social media guidelines again. The second violation occurred when she called on fans to boycott advertisers of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys after owner Jerry Jones told players they would be benched if they did not stand up during the national anthem.\n\nFox News' Amy Lieu contributed to this report.", "description": "Former ESPN host turned Atlantic staff writer Jemele Hill wrote a controversial first piece for the October issue in which she says black athletes should leave white colleges.", "authors": ["Brie Stimson"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-922429392.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
