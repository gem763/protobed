He did not, however, say whether he agreed with Johnson\u2019s choice of date.\n\nThe current parliament\u2019s bid to tie Johnson\u2019s hands leaves Brexit up in the air, with possible outcomes ranging from a no-deal exit from the EU to abandoning the whole endeavour - both outcomes that would be unacceptable to swathes of the United Kingdom\u2019s voters.\n\nAn alliance of opposition lawmakers and rebels from Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party voted 329-300 and then 327-299 for the bill in the second and third readings.\n\nJohnson said the bill had scuppered his Brexit negotiations with the EU and was designed to overturn the 2016 referendum on leaving the bloc.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s therefore a bill without precedent in the history of this house, seeking as it does to force the prime minister with a pre-drafted letter to surrender in international negotiations,\u201d Johnson told parliament. \u201cI refuse to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis house has left no other option than letting the public decide who they want as prime minister.\u201d\n\nELECTION STILL LOOMS\n\nJohnson\u2019s proposal for an election on Oct. 15 - a date that would allow him, if he won, to repeal the blocking bill - secured 298 votes to 56, far short of the 434 needed, as Labour abstained.\n\nSterling had earlier jumped above $1.22 for the first time since Aug. 30 as investors became slightly more optimistic that a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit could be avoided. [GBP/]\n\nBeyond the frantic political manoeuvring, the United Kingdom could still at some point leave the EU with a deal to smooth the transition, leave without a deal, or cancel Brexit.\n\nA prospective election would offer three likely alternatives: a Brexiteer government under Johnson; a Labour government led by veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn, who has promised a fresh referendum with staying in the EU as an option; and a \u2018hung\u2019 parliament with a coalition or minority government.\n\n\u201cIf I am still prime minister after Tuesday the 15th of October, then we will leave on the 31st of October with, I hope, a much better deal,\u201d he told parliament.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson gestures during Prime Minister's Questions session in the House of Commons in London, Britain September 4, 2019. \u00a9UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/Handout via REUTERS\n\nJohnson said he hoped to get a new deal at an EU summit scheduled for Oct. 17-18, but his opponents doubt he can achieve a better deal than the one his predecessor Theresa May negotiated but failed to get through parliament.\n\nOpponents of Brexit say an acrimonious \u2018no-deal\u2019 departure would be a disaster for what was one of the West\u2019s most stable democracies, shattering supply chains, damaging global growth, and weakening Britain\u2019s standing in the world.\n\nMany supporters of Brexit, though, say those fears are overblown and that, while there may be short-term disruption, it would provide a clean break from the struggling bloc and allow the United Kingdom to thrive.\n\nRESHAPING POLITICS\n\nIn a sign of how far Brexit has distorted British politics, Johnson\u2019s Conservatives said on Tuesday they were expelling 21 rebels - including the grandson of Britain\u2019s World War Two leader Winston Churchill and two former finance ministers - from the party for seeking to block any \u2018no-deal\u2019 exit.\n\nYet despite Johnson\u2019s efforts to up the ante, the EU has refused to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement reached with May.\n\nIn Brussels, British and EU diplomats made clear there was no immediate prospect of substantive negotiations on a divorce deal as Britain\u2019s new negotiator arrived for talks.\n\nAnd Ireland said Johnson had not yet presented any solutions to address the backstop - the toughest part of the Brexit impasse, concerning checks on the land border between the Irish Republic and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nSlideshow (26 Images)\n\nThere were reports in British newspapers that Johnson\u2019s top adviser Dominic Cummings had described negotiations as a sham.\n\nAsked on Wednesday if that was how he saw the Brexit negotiations with the EU, Cummings told Reuters: \u201cNo. I never said that.\u201d\n\nIn one piece of good news for Johnson, a Scottish court ruled on Wednesday that his decision to suspend parliament later this month was lawful.", "description": "The British parliament voted on Wednesday to prevent Prime Minister Boris Johnson taking Britain out of the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31, but rejected his first bid to call a snap election two weeks before the scheduled exit.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426273306&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF83278"}
