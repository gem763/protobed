Courtesy of El Paso Police Department/Handout via REUTERS\n\nPatrick Crusius, 21, was indicted for capital murder and will face the death penalty if he is convicted, El Paso County District Attorney Jaime Esparza said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe District Attorney\u2019s Office will continue to work hard to ensure that justice is done and is committed to assisting the victims through the judicial process,\u201d Esparza said.\n\nCrusius is accused of driving 11 hours from his hometown of Allen, Texas, near Dallas, to El Paso on Aug. 3 and firing at shoppers with an AK47 rifle inside a Walmart store, after which he surrendered to officers who confronted him outside the store.\n\nCrusius confessed while surrendering and told police he was targeting Mexicans, according to an El Paso police affidavit released days after the shooting.\n\nMost of those killed were Hispanic.\n\nA four-page statement believed to have been written by the suspect and posted on 8chan, an online message board often used by extremists, called the Walmart attack \u201ca response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d\n\nAfter the indictment against Crusius was announced, Texas Governor Greg Abbott released a 14-page report detailing several recommendations on how to stop mass shootings in the state.\n\n\u201cSolving the problems that have led to these horrific events will take more than governmental action,\u201d Abbott, a Republican, said in a statement. \u201cIt will require parents, families, churches, law enforcement, community groups, schools and others working together to fortify the social fabric of our society.\u201d\n\nThe Texas killings were followed just 13 hours later by a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, where a gunman wearing body armor and a mask killed nine people in less than a minute and wounded 27 others in the city\u2019s downtown historic district before he was shot dead by police.\n\nThe two massacres have reverberated across the political arena, with Democratic presidential candidates calling for stricter gun laws and accusing President Donald Trump of stoking anti-immigrant tensions.\n\nThe indictment against Crusius will not be available to the public until it has been filed by the District Clerk\u2019s Office. By law, the clerk\u2019s office has 10 days to file the indictment, a spokeswoman for Esparza said.", "description": "A Texas grand jury on Thursday indicted the man accused of killing 22 people and wounding 26 others in a shooting last month at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, who had told authorities he was targeting Mexicans, a local prosecutor said.", "authors": ["Brendan O", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429144155&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1P8", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
