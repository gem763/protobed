I have had a very limited life since losing Josh and I know I will suffer with anxiety, grief, and PTSD for the rest of my life.\n\n\"I would never of thought at the age of 25 I would go to sleep having a brother and be woken to be told that he had been murdered.\n\n\"I spoke to my brother four hours before his life was taken in the most horrific way. We said we loved one another and wished each other goodnight.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the murder O'Brien used false travel documents to flee the country in a chartered aircraft, and evaded authorities for more than three year.\n\nO'Brien was finally arrested in Romania in April and brought back to Britain - almost four years after the bloody killing.\n\n(Image: Met Police)\n\nDuring his murder trial at the Old Bailey, jurors were shown CCTV footage of him attacking the road planner in the early hours.\n\nIn the footage Mr Hanson is seen clutching his throat and stumbling in the road.\n\nAs his horrified girlfriend watches on, blood pours from the 37cm wound cut from his left ear to right chest.\n\nWhile Mr Hanson was bleeding to death, O'Brien calmly left the bar and called a friend who secured a four-seat plane which flew him from Biggin Hill to the Netherlands.\n\nThe killer grew long hair and a beard to disguise his appearance, as well as having a tattoo of his daughter's name covered.\n\nHe travelled between Germany, Belgium and Czech Republic using fake identity documents.\n\nWhen Interpol and Europol added the boxing enthusiast to their most wanted lists, O'Brien's friends helped him lay low.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe managed to wiggle out of the clutches of justice in 2017 when he was arrested in Prague for assault, giving a fake name and then fleeing when released on bail.\n\nIn court O'Brien denied murder and claimed he was threatened by Mr Hanson's \"very aggressive body language\".\n\nThe jury did not accept his argument that he only meant to scare the young man, finding him guilty after 55 minutes of deliveration.\n\nAfter O'Brien was convicted, Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said: \u201cEarly on it was clear O\u2019Brien was a well-resourced and connected individual.\n\n\"With astonishing ease he was able to arrange a trip out of London, a flight out of the UK.\n\n\"He had the means and connections to disappear, people who would support him with funds and by supplying fake documentation.\n\n\u201cThis was a case where we needed the public and media to flush him out.\n\n\"The plan was to get O\u2019Brien\u2019s face recognised across the world and make him a liability to those so keen to support him.\n\n\u201cTracey and Brooke formed an army of helpers to distribute reward posters across the world. We got O\u2019Brien onto Europol and Interpol\u2019s most wanted lists, a first as previously dual circulation was not permitted.\n\n\u201cWe had nearly a hundred potential sightings and we followed up every one - from Lidl in London to Luxemburg.\n\n\"At one point we believed he was in Dubai and did a lot of work with authorities there to try to track him.\n\n\"He also had links to Spain, France and Ireland.\n\n\u201cIn February 2017 he messed up \u2013 getting arrested and bailed in Prague for a minor scuffle in a club. It meant we were able to obtain up-to-date images of him, which revealed he\u2019d had a distinctive tattoo on his back of his children\u2019s name covered up by an owl holding a skull, had a full beard and had grown his hair.\n\n\"He was also using Italian aliases.\n\n\u201cThe work that went into trying to track him around the world was exceptional and I have nothing but thanks and praise for colleagues in the Met, the NCA and all those involved, including media here and abroad who carried so many of our appeals.\u201d", "description": "Josh Hanson's mum Tracey and sister Brooke have spoken of their trauma after his killer was finally jailed after nearly four years on the run", "authors": ["Dave Burke", "Image", "Central News", "Pa", "Met Police"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706794.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-cnl_J_Hanson_FAMILY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
