Next year\u2019s growth was also changed from 3.6 percent to 3.4 percent.Advanced economies\u2019 growth this year was lowered from 1.8 percent to 1.7 percent while emerging market\u2019s was lowered from 4.4 percent to 3.9 percent.The Chinese economy is expected to grow 6.1 percent, down from 6.3 percent.However, U.S. economic growth has been raised from 2.3 percent to 2.4 percent.Recently, major institutions have been lowering their projections on the Korean economy to 2 percent or lower.Last week, according to Korea Center for International Finance, nine investment banks\u2019 average predictions on the Korean economy including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and BoA Merrill Lynch for this year was 1.9 percent.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) last month lowered Korea\u2019s outlook from 2.4 percent in May\u2019s projection to 2.1 percent.The revised outlook came two days after the Blue House senior secretary for economic affairs claimed the Korean economy was doing fine.\u201c[The Korean economy] is doing relatively well,\u201d said Lee Ho-seung during a Blue House press briefing on Sunday. \u201cIt is irresponsible to talk about [an economic] crisis so casually.\u201dThe Blue House economic secretary said the current situation that the Korean economy is facing is not only a crisis that is exclusive to Korea, as the main problem lies in the global economic slowdown.\u201cAround 2018, the global economy started to slow, and for roughly two years it has been falling,\u201d Lee said. \u201cFor a country that grows from the large amount of exports, it is inevitable to be affected by the [economic] cycle and [global] economy,\u201d Lee said.Citing the OECD\u2019s latest forecast, Lee said other than the United States, which is expected to grow 2.4 percent this year, Korea\u2019s 2.1 percent growth is higher than other advanced economies including Britain and Japan, which are expected grow 1 percent, Germany half a percent and Italy which is predicted to remain flat.BY LEE HO-JEONG [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
