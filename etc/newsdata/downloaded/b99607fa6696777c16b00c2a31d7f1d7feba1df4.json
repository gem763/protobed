So says a new report, The Global Expansion of AI Surveillance, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Such technologies vary from \u201csmart city\u201d projects, which use real-time data on residents to aid delivery of public services and enhance policing, to facial recognition systems, to border security, to governments spying on political dissidents.\n\nThe main driver is China. The tech company Huawei alone is responsible for providing AI surveillance technology to at least 50 countries. But it\u2019s not just Beijing pushing such technology. Western companies, from IBM to Palantir, are deeply involved. In Saudi Arabia, for instance, Huawei is helping create smart cities, Google and Amazon are building cloud computing servers for government surveillance and the UK arms firm BAE is providing mass monitoring systems.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An array of advanced surveillance techniques are being deployed on the US-Mexico border.

Yet even before we\u2019ve begun to ask such questions, the technology has become so ubiquitous as to render the debate almost redundant. That should be as worrying as the technology itself.\n\n\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist", "description": "Use of AI surveillance technology is becoming the global norm, even in liberal democracies", "authors": ["Kenan Malik"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dba5337cf6c99f44cc3286d38c00f2038087192/463_7_3317_1990/master/3317.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8ff09aa5655e830d1155b82a6fa869be", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
