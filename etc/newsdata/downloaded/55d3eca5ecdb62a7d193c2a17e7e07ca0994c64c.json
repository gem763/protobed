But then a local resident named Steve Fines chipped in.\n\nAnd he had a heat-seeking drone to contribute.\n\nOnly on \u2066@FOX9\u2069: Ethan & Remmington! Home safe and sound.

When he heard Ethan was lost, he knew he had to do what he could to help find the boy. \"Six years old, lost out in the fields. It's 30 degrees. You can't not do something,\" he said.\n\nDon't Miss 335 SHARES 7.2 K SHARES 1.3 K SHARES 1.9 K SHARES 493 SHARES\n\nAccording to the local sheriff, Fines and his drone were able to locate Ethan 10 hours after he went missing. The drone spotted the boy Ethan lying with his dog Remington in a cornfield about a mile away from his home.\n\nThe boy was cold, but otherwise okay, and was fine after a quick trip to the hospital. If it hadn't been for the drone though, there's no saying whether he would have survived a few more hours in the snow.", "description": "On Tuesday last week, a six-year-old boy disappeared in Minnesota, prompting a widespread manhunt through the nearby streets and forestland in the region.
