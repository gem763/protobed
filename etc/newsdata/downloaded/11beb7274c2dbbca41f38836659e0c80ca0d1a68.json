We got two laureates from Europe", "language": "en", "text": "In the run-up to Thursday\u2019s announcement of a double Nobel prize in literature, the head of the award committee, Anders Olsson, made a bold claim. \u201cWe had a more Eurocentric perspective on literature,\u201d he said, \u201cand now we are looking all over the world.\u201d\n\nThis seems a curious assertion in light of the successive awards for 2018 and 2019 to Olga Tokarczuk (from Poland) and Peter Handke (from Austria). Whatever the merits of these writers \u2013 and Handke is certainly a controversial choice \u2013 or the congratulations due, the decision fails to demonstrate the widened perspective that Olsson promised. Taking him at his word, it invites questions about how diligent their search can have been, how knowledgeable the jury, and indeed how global a literary prize the Nobel can claim to be.\n\nAdonis, who can lay claim to being the Arab world\u2019s greatest living poet, is 89. His modernist experiments created a revolution in Arabic poetry comparable to TS Eliot\n\nFounded in 1901 and with global ambitions, the Nobel has been painfully slow to open up to the wider world of literatures beyond Europe and North America. Not until the mid-80s had a single African, Arab or Chinese writer won, though Asia\u2019s writers had a sparse presence in Rabindranath Tagore (1913) and Yasunari Kawabata (1968), and the Caribbean in Saint-John Perse (1960). Latin America fared marginally better, with Gabriela Mistral (1945), Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias (1967), Pablo Neruda (1971) and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (1982). For the late Chinua Achebe, the trailblazing writer from Nigeria who won the 2007 Man Booker International prize, the Swedish laurels that eluded him were quite simply a \u201cEuropean prize\u201d.\n\nThe final 15 years of the 20th century saw moves to extend the prize \u2013 and the world stature it confers \u2013 to more writers from the global south. Laureates in those years included Wole Soyinka, Nadine Gordimer and Mario Vargas Llosa. They also included the African American Toni Morrison.\n\nYet I cannot but sense glaring omissions. That writers of the stature of, for example, the Kenyan Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong\u2019o, the Syrian-born Adonis and the Somali Nuruddin Farah are perpetually in the running without finding success lends credence to Achebe\u2019s judgment about the prize\u2019s limited horizons.\n\nNgugi has not only been a momentous figure through his principled stand on African languages (resolving, while detained without trial, to write fiction only in his mother tongue, Gikuyu), but his serial memoir, now stretching to four volumes, is already an elegant and essential testament to the pursuit of freedom through the pen. His 1,000-page novel Wizard of the Crow (2006) broke with the early realism of his early classics in its grotesque, absurdist satire on postcolonial kleptocracy, with echoes of Alfred Jarry\u2019s Ubu Roi (1896) and the great Latin American dictatorship novels. That it was written to be read aloud in bars and matatus (shared taxis) adds to its literary innovations.\n\nAdonis, who since the death of Mahmoud Darwish in 2008 can lay reasonable claim to being the Arab world\u2019s greatest living poet, is 89. His modernist experiments created a revolution in Arabic poetry comparable to TS Eliot\u2019s in the anglophone world, in an art form with centuries of history that can still fill stadiums.\n\nNuruddin Farah\u2019s fiction in English has developed over half a century from his early feminist classic From A Crooked Rib (1970) through three trilogies set during the dictatorship of Mohamed Siad Barre (under whose rule the author was exiled) and its bloody aftermath, to his latest novel, North of Dawn (2018), which traced the dramas and dilemmas of a Somali family displaced to Norway by civil war. His impulse to \u201ckeep my country alive by writing about it\u201d has created the complex and subtle oeuvre that led Gordimer to admire him as one of the continent\u2019s \u201creal interpreters.\u201d\n\nIn 1998 Farah won the prize considered to be the US equivalent of the Nobel, the Neustadt, whose recipients have included others overlooked by the Swedish committee, including Raja Rao (1988), Edward Kamau Brathwaite (1994) and Assia Djebar (1996). To these names can be added many more, from Can Xue and Ma Jian writing in Chinese to George Lamming and Maryse Cond\u00e9 (who won last year\u2019s alternative Nobel prize) from the anglophone and francophone Caribbean.\n\nIf the Nobel committee is sincere in looking \u201call over the world\u201d, then such writers not only offer \u201coutstanding work in an ideal direction\u201d but also the formal and linguistic innovations that can arise from radically different perspectives and projects \u2013 such as representing one culture in the language of another. To read them, as a truly global literary award would spur and enable us to do, is not just to encounter \u201cother\u201d worlds, but to better understand the one we share \u2013 and ourselves.", "description": "Olga Tokarczuk and Peter Handke may be fine writers but their awards only add to suspicions over the prize\u2019s limited horizons", "authors": ["Maya Jaggi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fa69bbfeda1cb44d8c81ff3cad50b91f6994c47/0_0_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0c6fa5b3aaba24e41396556cc962178e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
