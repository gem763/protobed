This big cartoon of my mum with half a tree in her hand would come up in my head.\u201d\n\nHis mother Winifred, the family matriarch, was indomitable, deploying Victorian-style discipline to raising her large family - Lenny was one of seven siblings - in the \u201csemi-hostile\u201d Dudley in the West Midlands.\n\nAs a child, he was beaten with \u201cbelts, branches, boots, sometimes the occasional pan lid\u201d.\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nHe explains: \u201cFrom the time I started to go to my white friends\u2019 houses, I knew that a Jamaican household was very different. I lived in a house where \u2018spare the rod and spoil the child\u2019 was the rule. You got hit if you did something wrong and that was that.\u201d\n\nPunishment made him fearful of confrontation and, later, unquestioning over the direction of his early career choices. Something he would come to regret.\n\nHe says: \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to fight, I didn\u2019t know how to defend myself. I mean, if you broke a vase, if you kept the money from the shop, if you backchatted, you got hit with a stick and that was it.\u201d\n\nIt also made him seek other ways to diffuse tension and win respect; using jokes to face down one racist bully at his secondary modern school, Blue Coat, was a revelation. \u201cI had a weapon - humor. Result.\u201d\n\nYet amid the fisticuffs at home, there was love. \u201cThere was poverty and very strict discipline but there were lots of acts of love too. I was fed, I had clothes on my back,\u201d he says.\n\nHis father, Winston, a stoic factory worker who had arrived from Jamaica the year after his son\u2019s birth, was a distant presence. Years later, as he lay on his deathbed, Winston would finally open up. As Lenny writes in his new memoir, Who Am I, Again?: \u201cI wanted to scream, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you do this before? Why couldn\u2019t we speak like this when I was growing up?\u2019\u201d\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nIn a deeply poignant section of the memoir, included as a cartoon strip, Lenny reveals how aged ten his mother sent him to do pocket money chores for a handsome family friend, Albert Green, known as Bertie.\n\nAfter 18 months, he discovered to his utter shock that Bertie was his biological father. It was a moment he describes as akin to \u201cbeing flipped by a cosmic spatula\u201d.\n\nThe revelation led to guilt and shame, but Winston remained Lenny\u2019s dad.\n\n\u201cHe was reliable, he was there and he was the dad that raised me. So I respect him for that. In the end, I grieved for my family later,\u201d says Lenny.\n\nBut all the uncertainty left him a \u201csucker for a father figure\u201d, puppy-like, finding mentors among older, more experienced white comedians.\n\nPlaying the clubs, Lenny was forced to throw out racist gags as a form of self-defence. He recalls: \u201cThey were all things like, \u2018if you don\u2019t laugh I\u2019ll come and move in next door - that\u2019ll bring your rent down\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe heaviest toll came from Lenny\u2019s six years touring with The Black and White Minstrel Show.\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\u201cI got to play in the biggest theatres, the biggest clubs in Britain, I learnt a lot about how to deal with an audience. Particularly walking out and being the only black person in the building,\u201d he says.\n\nTiswas, when it came, provided unbridled energy and joy, in part because it wasn\u2019t the minstrel show.\n\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019d had a long period of being down, to be in Tiswas was a period of being up. Suddenly it was like being in the Beatles, a huge fanbase and freedom. It was like the road to recovery,\u201d he recalls.\n\nGirlfriends are absent from the book, which ends in 1980 so doesn\u2019t recount his subsequent relationship with Dawn French, the adoption of their daughter, Billie, or their 2010 divorce.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nBut Lenny, who will be on tour later this month, does recall the moment two years ago when he finally re-watched his first television appearance, assumed long-lost because ITV wiped the tapes.\n\nLenny says: \u201cIt was really moving. I could see in that kid\u2019s face the determination to hold it together and to get to the end. I could\u2019ve freaked out, \u2018oh my god I\u2019m on telly\u2019, but I didn\u2019t do that, I nailed it first time.\u201d\n\n* Who am I, again? by Lenny Henry (Faber & Faber, \u00a320).
