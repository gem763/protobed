They led the series 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2, but couldn't get the job done on home ice in Game 6 or on the road in Game 7.\n\n'We want more'\n\nToronto has come a long way \u2014 just not far enough for a team hungry to end a 52-year title drought.\n\n\"We were in last place [in 2014-15],\" said Babcock, who became the highest-paid coach in NHL history when he signed an eight-year, $50-million US contract with the Leafs. \"This team was no good. That's not the case now. We've got something to be proud of and our fans are proud of it.\n\n\"We want more, and I think that's the way life should be.\"\n\nWhile the division that includes Boston and the Tampa Bay Lightning got tougher this off-season, the 56-year-old said there's a belief internally a number of Leafs are ready to take a big step forward.\n\n\"A lot of our core players have gotten substantially better,\" said Babcock, a Cup-winning coach with the Detroit Red Wings in 2008. \"They've gotten older, they're more comfortable with themselves and they're more comfortable on the ice.\"\n\nMatthews' progress key\n\nOne of those players is Matthews, who's entering his fourth professional season with a hefty contract extension in his back pocket.\n\nBabcock was heavily criticized for his player deployment \u2014 including Matthews seeing just under 19 minutes of ice time \u2014 in Toronto's most recent Game 7 loss.\n\nThe coach pointed to shift length as one of the reasons, but the two spoke this off-season and appear to be on the same page.\n\nAuston Matthews and Mitch Marner are looking to advance past the first round for the first time in their careers this season. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)\n\n\"He wants to be a driving force,\" Babcock said of Matthews. \"No different than (Leafs centre) John Tavares. They want to be difference-makers. They want to be the guys that put their name on the Cup, that have led their team.\n\n\"That's what you aspire to as a player, and I think that's your job as a coach ... to help them.\"\n\nMatthews, who has put up 71 goals and 136 points over the last two seasons despite missing 34 games through injury, said the pair made \"positive progress\" this summer.\n\n\"You're never going to agree with everything,\" he said. \"I made it clear what I want to see out of him, and what he wants to see out of me.\"\n\nDiffering schools of thought\n\nBabcock's relationship with Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas also remains a juicy talking point. The former is widely viewed as old-school, while the latter's new-age approach leans heavily on analytics, speed and skill.\n\nDubas traded or cut loose a number of Babcock's favourite veterans \u2014 including winger Patrick Marleau and defenceman Ron Hainsey \u2014 in an off-season of change precipitated by a salary cap crunch and a desire to dress a lineup that more reflects the way he wants the game played.\n\nAnd with star winger Mitch Marner absent as negotiations on a new contract continue, Babcock has a lot on his plate as he looks to mesh a roster that could have as many as 10 new faces on opening night.\n\n\"A big job,\" said Babcock, who's 164-123-41 with Toronto and 691-408-179 overall as an NHL coach. \"This is as much change as I've seen since I've been in the National Hockey League.\"\n\nDubas said one of the areas where he wants improvement is how the Leafs deal with adversity. The second-year GM pointed to the Bruins, who lost Zdeno Chara, Patrice Bergeron, Charlie McAvoy and David Pastrnak for extended periods last season, and kept chugging along.\n\n\"Things are going to happen that we didn't expect,\" Dubas said. \"If we want to continue to take the right steps, we have to weather those and keep the train rolling on the tracks because the rest of the league doesn't stop.\"\n\nThat task will largely fall to Babcock.\n\n\"It's taken us some time to get here,\" he said. \"Now we're a team that we feel like has an opportunity each year.\n\n\"You get slapped around a little bit. All those little slappings help you grow. All you've got to do is look at the teams that win. They've been slapped previously.\"\n\nOne more slap and Babcock could be looking for work.", "description": "Mike Babcock is aware his seat will be a little warmer than usual this season.
