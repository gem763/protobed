Of course, there\u2019s some truth in that, just as there\u2019s some truth in most things. But I think the publisher\u2019s response was complicated by a number of factors, including the fact that Baldwin doesn\u2019t own up to using Hella the way David uses her: as a kind of beard to advance the real love story. Back then, Baldwin couldn\u2019t do without Hella, because how do you tell a love story between two men? (The author would grow into this in novels like 1962\u2019s \u201cAnother Country\u201d and 1979\u2019s \u201cJust Above My Head.\u201d) Toward the end of his life, he was still struggling with ideas he didn\u2019t know how to address in the novel. In 1985, he published \u201cFreaks and the American Ideal of Manhood,\u201d one of the last pieces he would live to see in print. (Baldwin died in Saint-Paul-de-Vence in 1987.) Here, he lives in his sexuality without metaphor:\n\nMy father kept me in short pants longer than he should have, and I had been told, and I believed, that I was ugly. This meant that the idea of myself as a sexual possibility, or target, as a creature capable of inciting desire or capable of desire, had never entered my mind. And it entered my mind, finally, by means of the rent made in my short boy-scout pants by a man who had lured me into a hallway, saying that he wanted to send me to the store. ... Shortly after I turned 16, a Harlem racketeer, a man of about 38, fell in love with me, and I will be grateful to that man until the day I die. I showed him all my poetry, because I had no one else in Harlem to show it to, and even now, I sometimes wonder what on earth his friends could have been thinking, confronted with stingy-brimmed, mustachioed, razor-toting Poppa and skinny, popeyed Me when he walked me (rarely) into various shady joints ... I knew he was showing me off and wanted his friends to be happy for him.\n\nIn a flash, Baldwin was the victim of molestation, and in another flash, there was love and protection. There was David Baldwin, and there was the poetry the young artist couldn\u2019t help but share with a Harlem racketeer who couldn\u2019t help but love the poet. You\u2019ll find all of that in \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room,\u201d but transmogrified through layers of Baldwin\u2019s deepest longings as a gay man, to be cherished and held, and to be seen and not seen, all at the same time. Still, what draws lovers of the book to its story of betrayal and the possibility of redemption through truth and, ultimately, to the question of the body as home, is the vision of Baldwin stumbling through it, sure-footed and alone, walking toward the idea that love may come attached with different ideas of what it should look like, feel like, but in the end, it\u2019s what you do with its responsibilities that renders you genderless \u2014 and human.\n\nHilton Als is a staff writer for The New Yorker.\n\nBehind the Story\n\nThe images in this story had existed, in some form, in the minds of its creators for over a decade. Shot by the New York City-based artist John Edmonds and styled by Carlos Nazario, the pictures are a visual reimagining of \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room.\u201d The book was personally significant to nearly all the main collaborators, all of whom (including the critic and New Yorker staff writer Hilton Als, who wrote the accompanying piece) are queer men. \u201cThis story had permeated my mind,\u201d says Edmonds, who first encountered \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room\u201d a decade ago, at age 20. \u201cIt was the first novel I read about a relationship between two men.\u201d Likewise, the New York-based actor James Cusati-Moyer, who portrays the novel\u2019s namesake character in the images (and appears in Jeremy O. Harris\u2019s \u201cSlave Play\u201d on Broadway this month), remains captivated by the book some 10 years after he first read it. \u201cI always fell in love with the character of Giovanni,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I hadn\u2019t thought of one day playing that role.\u201d\n\nAs the team arrived in Paris for the shoot this past July, the city was in the grip of a heat wave. There was a \u201cParisian fatigue in the air,\u201d says Cusati-Moyer, which helped conjure the feverish mood of the book. Edmonds, whose work was featured in the most recent Whitney Biennial, had found a crumbling apartment near Place de la R\u00e9publique to replicate the novel\u2019s main setting and procured a catalog of objects that appear in the book: a crucifix, a cut-glass whisky tumbler. Nazario, who also lives in New York City, kept the clothing timeless (\u201cIt\u2019s an age-old tale,\u201d he says). But in one aspect, the story deliberately veered from its source material: \u201cBaldwin came to prominence in a very different time in America, where a black artist had to write a white narrative about white characters to be avant-garde,\u201d says Edmonds. \u201cIn retelling the story through a set of images, I wanted one of the characters to be black.\u201d In this version, the book\u2019s white protagonist, David, is played by the British-Nigerian dancer and model Temi Bolorunduro, who lives in London. \u201cWhile we were remaining true to the essence of the novel,\u201d says Cusati-Moyer, \u201cwe were also staying true to the potential of what this love story could have been.\u201d \u2014 ALICE NEWELL-HANSON\n\nModels: James Cusati-Moyer and Temi Bolorunduro.
