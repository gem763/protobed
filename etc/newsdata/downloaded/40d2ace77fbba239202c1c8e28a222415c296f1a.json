Upon tracking him down, the siblings issued Ben with a stern warning, and it became clear rather quickly that you wouldn\u2019t want to mess with these guys!\n\nIn the coming episodes, the family arrive in Walford, and \u2014 when Ben gets wind of their arrival \u2014 he proceeds to confront them.\n\nHowever, the Mitchell lad is soon left embarrassed when he realises that they\u2019re not actually there to see him \u2014 a revelation which begs the question of who exactly they are there to visit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, Jags recognises a familiar face while in Walford \u2014 but who is it?\n\nIt seems as if the Panesars might have connections in Albert Square \u2014 which could perhaps end up being the reason the three characters start to appear in the soap more frequently.\n\nHowever, who those connections are have yet to be revealed.\n\nOne to watch: Tuesday 29th October at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "But who?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18730076-low_res-eastenders-october-december-2019-7acb_1571224334.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
