They\u2019ve made a difference in their time.\u201d\n\nFormer English teacher Schmidt took charge in 2013 and he and Best have overseen a purple patch since the disappointment of the 2015 World Cup, when an injury-hit side were run ragged by Argentina in the quarter-finals.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Bit of an insomniac\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cSome of the wins he has had have set standards that are probably different than they were before he took over,\u201d argued Ireland lock James Ryan.\n\nLuke McGrath added: \u201cEveryone goes into championships now thinking we have a very good chance of winning \u2013- and that\u2019s all down to the work Joe has done over the last six-and-a-half years and we\u2019ll be sad to see him leave.\u201d\n\nSchmidt\u2019s legacy includes three Six Nations titles in six campaigns. Prior to his arrival the Irish had only won one in the previous 28 years \u2014 the 2009 Grand Slam with Brian O\u2019Driscoll as captain.\n\nThey entered the World Cup at number one in the global rankings, a position they occupied for two weeks before New Zealand resumed their long-term occupancy of the top spot.\n\n\u201cOne word you associate with Joe Schmidt is detail,\u201d O\u2019Driscoll, who played under Schmidt at both Leinster and Ireland, told AFP.\n\n\u201cI have never known any coach to scrutinise a game like him. He is an absolute rugby anorak, it is his passion as well as his profession. He is a bit of an insomniac too as he watches so much of it.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Driscoll added: \u201cHe isn\u2019t too schoolmasterly, but you want to know what you are talking about, don\u2019t go off half-cocked. He will sit you down too if needs be, he won\u2019t take any bullshit.\u201d\n\nIreland fly-half Jonny Sexton said Schmidt brought a holistic approach to his job, adding he had left an \u201cunbelievable mark\u201d on Irish rugby.\n\n\u201cRather than winning being everything, it was all about values and how you act day-to-day, on and off the pitch,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is perhaps fitting Schmidt bowed out against the revered New Zealand, the country of his birth.\n\n\u201cInevitably, as a four-year-old kid when I first started playing rugby, barefoot rugby in Te Aroha in New Zealand, everyone looks up to the All Blacks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou watch them as a young kid and all the way through.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 A \u201cbroken\u201d Joe Schmidt signed off as Ireland coach with a crushing loss to his native New Zealand that condemned the Irish", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/eb817c_joe-schmidt-won-six-nations-titles-ireland-number-one-in-world-broken-by-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
