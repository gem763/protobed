He is stronger than he looks and he is a lot quicker than he looks \u2013 he is a beast.\u201d\n\nA beast is not a bad description. Just ask the Genk defenders who felt the force of the now 19-year-old Red Bull Salzburg striker on Tuesday as he scored a hat-trick on his Champions League debut, a feat not achieved since Wayne Rooney in 2004. The first goal arrived after 102 seconds, the Norwegian rifling a low shot underneath Ga\u00ebtan Coucke in the Genk goal. The second was scored with his left foot and the third was an opportunistic stab past Coucke from inside the six-yard box.\n\nThe game finished 6-2 and afterwards Haaland\u2019s teammate Maximilian W\u00f6ber could hardly contain his glee, saying: \u201cHe is phenomenal. With his height, to be so nimble and have such command of the ball. It\u2019s really hard to play against him in training \u2013 you just have to foul him. Once again he proved why he\u2019s definitely going to become one of the best strikers in the world.\u201d\n\nIt may sound a ridiculous statement, but this is one extremely talented and hard-working young man. His career is being meticulously planned by his father and, almost inevitably, Mino Raiola and he has already changed his name from H\u00e5land to Haaland, one suspects to make it more international. \u201cOne step ahead,\u201d he said with a smile when asked about it.\n\nWithout my upbringing in Bryne I would not be where I am today Erling Braut Haaland\n\nOne step ahead indeed. He arrived at Molde in January 2017 after 16 games and no goals for Bryne in the second tier. Then he got to work. Along with the centimetres and the kilos came the goals. He scored four in 20 games in 2017 before hitting 12 in 25 appearances the following year, including a remarkable four-goal haul against league leaders Brann in July. Before the game Brann had conceded five goals in 14 games but Haaland took only 20 minutes to destroy that defence.\n\nHis decision to join Salzburg in January 2019 raised eyebrows as he had offers from Juventus and Bayer Leverkusen among others. Salzburg had to pay around \u00a38m but that already seems like one of the deals of the decade.\n\n\u201cI was obviously flattered by Juventus being interested,\u201d he said in January, before adding \u201cbut I thought that it was to early to go there. Salzburg was the club that suited me the best and they were the ones who wanted me the most. I also think it was very important to look at how important a part I was going to play for the club I joined. There is more of a chance of playing here.\u201d\n\nHaaland has a remarkable 17 goals in nine games for Salzburg this season and in May he scored nine goals in an Under-20 World Cup game against Honduras. Afterwards he said that he should have got 10 and no one was quite sure whether he was joking.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Erling Braut Haaland celebrates one of his nine goals against Honduras at the Under-20 World Cup in May.

Haaland is a Leeds fan, having been born in the city, and has said he would like to win the Premier League with the club, although they will have to improve drastically for Haaland to contemplate a move to Elland Road (and he has played for Norway\u2019s senior side so there is no chance of him declaring for the country of his birth).\n\nFor now, though, he is fully focused on Red Bull Salzburg. \u201cIt is not right to talk about other clubs when you are with a team and they are paying your wages,\u201d Alfie H\u00e5land said recently. \u201cYou have to focus on your current club and give everything for them.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nFor Haaland that means Austrian Bundesliga games against LASK, Rapid Vienna and Austria Vienna before the next Champions League game, against Liverpool at Anfield on 2 October. And the chances of this latest success going to his head appear remote. His Salzburg manager, Jesse Marsch, praised Haaland after the game against Genk, saying what a genuine and down-to-earth person he is. \u201cHe is a great player but even more important for me is that he\u2019s a great young man,\u201d the American said. \u201cHe shows up every day, he works hard and takes nothing for granted. He gives everything for his teammates every day and does it with a smile.\u201d\n\nAccording to Haaland his approach to life and football stems from his early years in Norway. \u201cWithout my upbringing in Bryne I would not be where I am today,\u201d he said recently. \u201cWe have a special environment there. It has always contributed towards me not thinking that I am not something special. I have always been humble, worked hard and not thought much about other things.\u201d\n\nHumble yet devastating, Haaland could become one of the best in the world. For many players a Champions League hat-trick would be the pinnacle of their careers but for this young man it is probably just the start.", "description": "The 19-year-old son of Alfie H\u00e5land scored a hat-trick on his Champions League debut on Tuesday and has 17 goals in nine games for Red Bull Salzburg this season", "authors": ["Marcus Christenson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54a6ac5aefb5770316ed459408daa60a8b612b30/377_341_1283_770/master/1283.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7bc92f31d9f2bc9c7b3de42892bc230", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
