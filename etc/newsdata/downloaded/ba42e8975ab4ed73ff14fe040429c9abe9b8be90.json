ABC's David Wright is right there at the white house. David, what's going on with the about-face? Reporter: Well, good morning, Dan. This is a rare retreat for president trump and it came last night in a series of tweets. The president tweeting, based on both media and democrat-crazed, irrational hostility, we will no longer consider trump national Doral in Miami as the host site for the g7. We will begin the search for another site immediately. The decision to hold the g7 at a trump resort was controversial from the start. Acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, suggested that the president would not be profiting from it. He said that this wasn't the only choice but he claimed it was the best choice. Many were skeptical. The g7 takes place in June. It can be a bit muggy in Miami in June. Doral has struggled financially and there were reports of a bed bug infestation this past year which briefly caused the hashtag bed bug summit to trend. Dan. It's muggy and June and also the beginning of hurricane season. The white house, as you mentioned, said that the trump organization would do this summit for cost, meaning they wouldn't make a profit. That was not persuasive to the critics however. Reporter: It was not, Dan. For one thing, it's not clear how the trump organization would have calculated that, and even at cost a g7 would certainly have helped the bottom line. The last one in France cost the French taxpayers $40 million, so house Democrats were planning to hold hearings. The white house counsel's office privately expressed some reservations and the constitution prohibits the president from profiting from his office. So by setting this plan aside the white house is at the very least sparing itself another round of investigations. David, thank you very much. Whit, over to you. To the race for 2020.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "The president received criticism after pushing to hold next year\u2019s G-7 summit at his Miami hotel.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191020_gma_wright2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
