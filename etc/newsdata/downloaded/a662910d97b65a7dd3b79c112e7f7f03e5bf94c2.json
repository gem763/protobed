While the impact of the past 40 years of computerisation is showing, the industry is yet to fully calculate the impact of technology.\n\nIn the US banks are spending $150 billion \u2013 the equivalent of R2.3 trillion \u2013 a year on developing new technology. That is more than any other sector in that market.\n\nIt\u2019s anticipated that the use of AI could cut as much as 20% off the cost of mortgage processing, an expensive process, while the use of data analysis will better enable banks to advertise services directly to clients, creating \u201csurgical\u201d marketing opportunities.\n\nThere is a growing body of evidence that better analytics of our money habits and transaction patterns will allow providers to offer us exactly the right financial products. That has the potential of a devastating impact on traditional media and advertising in the future.\n\nSenior Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo told the Financial Times the relationship between banking and advancing technology had been rocky for 25 years, but is finally getting on course for what he describes as the \u201cgolden age of banking efficiency\u201d.\n\nIncluded in bank results is an efficiency ratio which neatly shows just how much money a bank has to spend to earn money.\n\nSouth African banks tend to operate in the mid-to-high 50s. A cost-to-income ratio of 58, for example, means that it costs the bank 58c to earn every Rand in generates. The chance to reduce that cost is a very powerful incentive for executives to reduce costs, particularly in a South African environment where sluggish economic growth makes growing loans and other services very difficult to achieve.\n\nThe Wells Fargo study warns it will be staff in increasingly defunct branches, those who do mundane back office functions, call centre operators and corporate employees, who are most at risk of serious cutbacks.\n\nWith pay making up half of some banks overall costs in the US \u2013 and a big proportion too of costs in South Africa \u2013 the report says it is inevitable that the ever-advancing banking technology revolution is going to have a serious human consequence.\n\nBruce Whitfield is a multi-platform award-winning financial journalist and broadcaster.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Bruce Whitfield:", "description": "200,000 jobs will go in the US the next decade, replaced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machines - South Africa is next.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7748/27fad7d73c324953aee32955a1038503.jpg"}
