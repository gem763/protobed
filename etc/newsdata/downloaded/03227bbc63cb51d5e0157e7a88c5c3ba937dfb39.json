Here\u2019s what to expect from the company\u2019s report.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect PayPal to post 52 cents in adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter, compared with 58 cents a year earlier. The company disclosed in a filing earlier this month that it expected a negative-15-cent impact to adjusted earnings stemming from unrealized losses on strategic investments. In conjunction with its last earnings report in July, management had projected a roughly 3-cent benefit from adjusted gains.\n\nRevenue: The FactSet consensus calls for $4.35 billion in third-quarter revenue, up from $3.68 billion a year ago. According to Estimize, which crowdsources projections from hedge funds, academics and others, the average estimate is for $4.36 billion.\n\nStock movement: PayPal shares have risen following six of the company\u2019s past 10 earnings reports. The stock has climbed 21% so far this year, outpacing a 20% gain for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.21% over that time. Of the 42 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover PayPal\u2019s stock, 33 rate it a buy, eight call it a hold, and one has a sell rating. The average target price listed is $127.05, 25% above recent levels.\n\nWhat else to watch for\n\nEl-Assal of Barclays expects PayPal to give an initial 2020 outlook this quarter, which he expects to fall \u201ctoward the low end of their medium-term guidance range provided at PayPal\u2019s [May 2018] investor day (17%-18%).\u201d He said there\u2019s \u201cmore uncertainty than usual\u201d heading into the quarter since investors will be looking for some indication that PayPal will be able to capture the delayed revenue it talked about on its last call. In addition, there are numerous potential outcomes related to eBay\u2019s changing relationship with PayPal, and the digital-payments giant will need to give a forecast that leaves room for various timing scenarios.\n\nHe rates the stock at overweight with a $127 target price.\n\nEBay earnings: A \u2018waiting game\u2019 with strategic review still underway\n\nSusquehanna analyst Jamie Friedman highlighted a new policy change around returns that affects certain types of merchants on a standard pricing plan.\n\n\u201cPer a recent PayPal policy update, most sellers operating under the general PayPal agreement (i.e., paying the 2.9% +$0.30 transaction fee) forfeit the return of the transaction processing costs back to PayPal upon the return of a purchase,\u201d he wrote. Susquehanna \u201ccalculates that this new policy \u2014 which we believe better harmonizes with industry practice \u2014 could generate increased revenues of $300+ million annually.\u201d\n\nFriedman has a positive rating and $120 price target on the stock.\n\nAnother key theme will be PayPal\u2019s ongoing efforts to monetize its Venmo service. Most recently, the company announced a Venmo credit card that\u2019s expected out in the second half of 2020. Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods analyst Sanjay Sakhrani expects that the card could add $70 million to $100 million of annualized revenue for PayPal after the launch, though the company has yet to give concrete details on the features that will be part of this new card.\n\nMore immediately, PayPal may give updates on how current Venmo monetization efforts are playing out. These include a Venmo debit card, the Pay with Venmo option at online merchants, and the ability to instantly transfer funds to a bank account. The company said in conjunction with its last earnings call that about 15 million Venmo users had engaged in a monetizable experience as of then.", "description": "The company will likely provide an early glimpse at its 2020 forecast.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GJ515_PayPal_ZG_20180518161241.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
