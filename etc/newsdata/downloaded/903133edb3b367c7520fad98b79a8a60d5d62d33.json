The couple, also jailed in Norway in 2010 for \u00adtrafficking 240 kilos of cannabis resin, protested their innocence.\n\nRoger, who changed his surname from Button, said he was given the cases by two Jamaican associates with whom he was negotiating a deal to import exotic fruit.\n\nHe said he was offered \u00a3800 but had no idea what they contained. His wife maintained she had nothing to do with her husband\u2019s business dealings.\n\nBut prosecutors said the pair were drug mules who had been on four cruises to South America in two years as a front for their crimes.\n\nThe judge dismissed the couple\u2019s claim that they were duped and, as she sentenced them to eight years, Roger told Susan: \u201cWe will be 80 when we get out\u201d.\n\nThe couple were told they would serve their terms in Portugal, rather than being returned to Britain.\n\nBut Roger, from Chatham, Kent, hopes they can be transferred to Funchal Prison, in Madeira, where both men and women can do their time.\n\nRoger said: \u201cMy wife is in another prison. We have been in for 10 months but we have had just three visits.\n\n\u201cWe are going to obtain forms asking for a transfer to Madeira as it takes both male and female prisoners \u2013 at least we would be able to see each other daily.\n\n\u201cThe judge for whatever reason said we both must serve our sentence in this country and not be allowed to transfer to the UK to complete it.\u201d\n\nRoger has also told how his health has waned since being locked-up.\n\n\u201cI have a heart condition and had stents fitted in 2010,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was rushed to hospital with a suspected heart attack here.\n\n\u201cIt turned out to be something to do with my chest muscles as I have lost nearly six stone.\u201d\n\nSources say Susan is working in the sewing department of Lisbon\u2019s Tires Prison, stitching soft toys and sharing a cell with four other inmates.\n\nAnd Roger has applied for a job to help while away his sentence too.\n\n\u201cMind you, the pay is two euros per day,\u201d he said.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Roger Clarke and wife Susan, 71, were busted with \u00a31million of class A drug on a luxury Caribbean liner - but he claims they've been set up", "authors": ["Dan Warburton", "Image", "Solarpix.Com", "Reuters", "Phil Harris Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20468397.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Roger-and-Sue-Clarke.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
