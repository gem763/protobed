Houghton initially planned to publish \u201cOutrages\u201d as scheduled, but soon changed its mind, announcing that \u201cnew questions have arisen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOutrages\u201d had already come out in the United Kingdom when Wolf was challenged in May by a BBC interviewer over whether she had wrongly interpreted that some gays had received the death penalty. Wolf has acknowledged some errors, but contended they were fixable and openly objected to the postponement. She even promoted \u201cOutrages\u201d on her own in the U.S., with attendees offered the chance to buy the UK edition.\n\nPublishers rarely fact-check books, citing time and expense. Wolf, known for such best-sellers as \u201cThe Beauty Myth\u201d and \u201cMisconceptions,\u201d has had her scholarship challenged before. In \u201cThe Beauty Myth,\u201d she wrote that anorexia caused the deaths of 150,000 women a year, a number widely regarded as inflated.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Naomi Wolf and her U.S. publisher have split up amid a dispute over her latest book, \"Outrages.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Hillel Italie"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
