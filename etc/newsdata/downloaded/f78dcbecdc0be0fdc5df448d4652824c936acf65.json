It would replace a much smaller pelican statue.\n\nAustralia's Big Things: just how big are they?

It is 4.7 metres tall.\n\nThe Pelican Rapids local Jody Bowers said tourists came to the town of 2,500 people to visit the lakes and not specifically the giant pelican.\n\n\u201cGood for them, if they want to build it, I say go for it,\u201d Bowers told Guardian Australia. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would affect us too badly.\u201d\n\nBowers said local residents dressed Pelican Pete up for winter. \u201cThey put a hat on him and scarf,\u201d she said.\n\nThe landmark was always centre stage during the town\u2019s art in the park summer festival in July, Bowers said.\n\nAs well as Pelican Pete, which is made from an iron frame and plaster, Pelican Rapids is home to a 2.7-metre rusting replica of the Seattle Space Needle.\n\nThe Australian pelican came in 24th in Guardian/Bird Life Australia bird of the year poll in 2017 with 1.48% of the vote. The poll will return in October.", "description": "Locals from Pelican Rapids in Minnesota are unfazed about losing the record to The Entrance in NSW", "authors": ["Lisa Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f455a08ad470f85bd6eee0b52a5d0733af203fb6/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e0111125d88b12740049dceb57f2d7bf"}
