With nearly one in three people now living in poverty, voters have backed the candidate they think is best-placed to lead the country out of the crisis.\n\nMr Macri promised to achieve \"zero poverty\", but things have actually worsened during his four-year rule. Little is known of Mr Fern\u00e1ndez's policies, but he says he will play safe with finances.\n\nWhile casting their votes on Sunday, some said they believed Mr Fern\u00e1ndez would be able to save the economy, while others said it was broken when Mr Macri came to power, and he needed more time to sort things out.\n\nOpponents of Mr Fern\u00e1ndez have expressed concerns that his running-mate, former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, may end up calling the shots if he wins the election.\n\nMs Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner is fondly remembered by her supporters as a modern-day Eva Per\u00f3n, who championed the poor with welfare programmes. But she is a divisive figure, also accused of being corrupt and economically irresponsible.\n\nWho are the candidates?\n\nSix candidates have been fighting for the presidency, but the attention has centred on two men.\n\nMauricio Macri, right-wing businessman\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPresident Macri defied expectations by winning the 2015 presidential election run-off, becoming the country's first unambiguously conservative president to win a free and fair election since 1916.\n\nBorn into a wealthy business family, Mr Macri worked in banking before going into politics - a step he partly attributes to his experience being kidnapped and held ransom by rogue police officers in 1991.\n\nHe entered Buenos Aires city politics in 2003, where his profile was helped by his presidency of Boca Juniors, one of Argentina's most successful football clubs. He was elected mayor four years later and emerged as leader of the opposition to centre-left presidents N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner.\n\nAs president, he promised to end corruption, lift the capital controls of his predecessor and begin major infrastructure projects. But his impressive victory in mid-term elections in 2017 came on the back of a borrowing spree.\n\nHe attempted to push through economic reforms as debts mounted. Now the crisis has wiped out much of his support.\n\nAlberto Fern\u00e1ndez, centre-left ex-campaign strategist\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nFor a career politician with little charisma, Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has caused quite a stir since he first appeared in the limelight of Argentine politics some six months ago.\n\nThe former campaign strategist began his bid for the presidency in May - something of a surprise as ex-president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner had been widely tipped to be the centre-left opposition coalition's candidate for the top office.\n\nBut Mr Fern\u00e1ndez really came into his own in August when he defeated Mr Macri by nearly 15 percentage points in primary elections, a compulsory vote for all electors which is seen is a dry-run for the presidency. This victory, defying all predictions, sets him up as clear favourite.\n\nHow does the election work?\n\nVoting is compulsory for those aged between 18 and 70. There are some 33.8 million eligible voters, who will also elect 130 members of the Chamber of Deputies and 24 Senate members, as well as some governors and the Mayor of Buenos Aires.\n\nA presidential candidate needs at least 45% of the vote, or 40% and a 10-point lead over the second-place contestant, to win in the first round.\n\nIf no-one achieves that, a run-off election will be held on 24 November between the first and second placed candidates.", "description": "Centre-left candidate Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez is tipped for victory after a vote dominated by the economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8310/production/_109425533_5fd96dc1-8022-410d-baf2-ed6a3b69044a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
