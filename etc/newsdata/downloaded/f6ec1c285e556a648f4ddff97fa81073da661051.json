Kershaw, a three-time NL Cy Young Award winner with a spotty history in October, entered with two on and two outs in the seventh and struck out Adam Eaton.\n\nThe winner plays the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Championship Series starting Friday. St. Louis routed Atlanta 13-1 in Game 5 of that series earlier Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers are tied 3-3 after nine innings in Game 5 of their NL Division Series on Wednesday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/f19eb1_aptopix-nlds-nationals-dodgers-baseball-75871-los-angeles-dodgers-pitcher-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
