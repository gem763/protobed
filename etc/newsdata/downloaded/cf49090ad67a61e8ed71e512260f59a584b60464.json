She\u2019s running the most sophisticated political warfare, the most sophisticated political disinformation campaign, and they\u2019re winning right now. And we gotta get organized right now.\u201d\n\nBannon went on to say that his aim is to \u201cgive people the facts and the details of the witnesses, the testimony, the legal arguments\u201d of the impeachment inquiry, with the ultimate goal of making sure Trump is \u201cacquitted.\u201d\n\nBannon went on to say that he called it back in 2018. \u201cAs soon as President Trump and Republicans lost control of the House because of Paul Ryan and these feckless House Republicans that did not fight to save the House, we said back then in 2018, that the [Democrats] were going to impeach the president. Well, they are moving for it now.\u201d\n\nIn other Bannon-related news, in November he is expected to to appear as a witness for the government testifying against Trump ally Roger Stone. According to the National Law Journal, Bannon has not been subpoenaed. Stone has been charged with lying to a congress and attempting to \u201cpersuade a witness to provide false testimony.\u201d\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
