A new study is putting one preconceived notion about stand-offish felines to bed. The study published in Current Biology dug deep into cats' sometimes misunderstood relationships with humans, and found the felines actually do bond with their owners.\n\nThe authors of the study acknowledge dogs have received a considerable amount of scientific attention over the years \u2013 perhaps because they form obvious attachment bonds with humans. \"Despite fewer studies, research suggests we may be underestimating cats' socio-cognitive abilities,\" the study's authors write.\n\nThe researchers found \"cats display distinct attachment styles toward human caregivers,\" and evidence shows cats, dogs and humans share social traits \u2013 suggesting these traits should not only be attributed to dogs alone.\n\nA new study is proving cats are not as independent and stand-offish as some may think. www.shutterstock.com\n\nThe study used a Secure Base Test (SBT), conducted on 70 kittens aged 3 to 8 months. At the end of the study, almost all of the kittens were classified into attachment styles, with 64.3% being \"securely attached.\"\n\nDuring this test, the kittens spent two minutes in a room with their caregiver, then two minutes alone. Then, they were reunited for two minutes. When the caregivers returned, cats with secure attachments displayed a \"reduced stress response and contact-exploration balance with the caretaker.\"\n\nThose with insecure attachment, 35.7 percent, remained stressed. These cats were further categorized into ambivalent, avoidance, or having a approach/avoidance conflict.\n\nThe criteria has been used when studying human infants and dogs. The researchers found that, because cats are like most domesticated animals, they retain some juvenile traits as they age and so their attachment behavior toward a caregiver would probably stay the same in their adulthood.\n\nTo test this, the researchers continued to study 38 of the cats over one year of age and found \"distinct attachment styles were evident in adult cats, with a distribution similar to the kitten population (65.8% secure, 34.2% insecure).\" So, even adult cats are have \"relatively stable\" attachments to their caregivers.\n\nWhen comparing the kittens to children and dogs who underwent the same test, researchers found felines are actually similar to humans. Like cats, 65 percent of children have a secure attachment and 35 percent have insecure attachment to their caregivers. Dogs are 58 percent secure and 42 percent insecure, researchers found.\n\nCBS News has reached out to the lead author of the study, Kristyn R.
