That\u2019s ratherhow it feels revisiting central Europe 30 years after the velvet revolutions of 1989.\n\nEarlier this year, I sat in a hotel bar in Budapest with an old anti-communist dissident friend, J\u00e1nos Kis, who calmly described the regime of prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n to me as an autocracy. Yet it was Kis who first introduced me to Orb\u00e1n, back in 1988, presenting the then 25-year-old student as a bright light of a new generation of young liberal democrats. At a rally in Gda\u0144sk in June, I heard European council president Donald Tusk call on his fellow Poles to learn from the example of the Solidarity movement of the 1980s in opposing the country\u2019s nationalist populist Law and Justice party government. Yet Law and Justice triumphed again this month in a general election.\n\nThe future triumph of anti-liberal authoritarianism is no more inevitable than was the future triumph of liberal democracy\n\nIn the Czech republic, power is divided between the prime minister Andrej Babi\u0161, an oligarch who was once listed as an informer by the secret police in communist-ruled Slovakia, and the bibulous president, Milo\u0161 Zeman, who makes no secret of his sympathetic view of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and Xi Jinping\u2019s China. In the territory that used to be the Stasiland of East Germany, the far-right, virulently xenophobic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has received the support of a shocking one in four voters, in no less than three recent state elections: in Saxony, Brandenburg and \u2013 only last Sunday \u2013 in Thuringia. This despite the fact that these states have for nearly three decades been part of one of the richest, most stable democracies in the world, which has made vast financial transfers to precisely these poorer post-communist regions.\n\nNo wonder commentators are rushing to paint a chiaroscuro picture: from yesterday\u2019s glorious light to today\u2019s encircling darkness. Overstatement is often felt to be essential to get your voice heard in an overcrowded internet marketplace of ideas, and so we read of the coming death of democracy, a new age of the dictators, and so on. This is simplistic and shortsighted.\n\nOur mistake after 1989 was not that we celebrated what happened in central Europe \u2013 and subsequently in the Baltic republics and the former Soviet Union \u2013 as a great triumph for freedom, democracy, Europe and the west. It was all of that. Our mistake was to believe that it was the new normal, the direction history was travelling. Now we are in danger of making the same mistake, only in the other direction. The future triumph of anti-liberal authoritarianism is no more inevitable than was the future triumph of liberal democracy. This cautiously optimistic statement clearly holds true in mature democracies such as Britain and the United States, where the forces of liberal democracy are pushing back hard against the ravages of nationalist populism. But it\u2019s also true in central Europe. Strictly speaking, \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d is a contradiction in terms, like fried snowballs. However, the term is useful to describe the condition of a democracy that is being eroded, but has not been completely destroyed. The decline is still reversible by democratic, legal means, including peaceful mass protest.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In August this year, thousands of demonstrators marched in Prague to protest against Czech prime minister Andrej Babi\u0161 and president Milo\u0161 Zeman.

Sparked by the horrifying murder of a journalist who had been trying to expose that corruption, J\u00e1n Kuciak, together with his fiancee, mass peaceful protest helped oust a post-communist populist prime minister, Robert Fico. The momentum from those protests contributed to the election this year of a female, liberal, pro-European president, Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1. \u010caputov\u00e1, who was only 16 at the time of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia in November 1989, is a fine representative of a new generation shaped by the experience of what I call \u201cpost-Wall\u201d Europe. So when I go to Bratislava next month, there will be much to celebrate.\n\nI will take the train from Bratislava to Prague, crossing what is now an international frontier between Slovakia and the Czech Republic, in time to witness what promises to be a large demonstration against the dreadful duo of Babi\u0161 and Zeman. It will be organised by a student-led movement called A Million Moments For Democracy, to mark the 30th anniversary of the beginning of the 1989 Velvet Revolution. They already put together a huge demo this summer at Letn\u00e1 park, the site of the largest peaceful protest in 1989. One of the organisers, Benjamin Roll, a cheerful, bearded theology student, told me his father had been a sound engineer at the 1989 demo, literally amplifying the voice of V\u00e1clav Havel. So in the Czech Republic, too, there are grounds for hope.\n\nElection results give hope to opposition in Poland and Hungary Read more\n\nFor the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Wall, I shall be back in Berlin, staying in the hotel that was then the showcase Grand Hotel of the communist regime and is now a Westin. Shocking though the AfD results are, they don\u2019t fundamentally threaten German democracy. That cannot be said of Law and Justice rule in Poland, for the party of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski clearly wants to follow the Hungarian example. It is pursuing Orb\u00e1nisation \u00e0 la polonaise. But it faces powerful independent media, major opposition parties, big cities under opposition control, and a highly mobilised civil society.\n\nBy far the worst case is Hungary. Freedom House last year downgraded its status to \u201cpartly free\u201d, the only EU member state to be so classified. Indeed, after careful analysis I have argued that Hungary is no longer a democracy \u2013 not even an illiberal one \u2013 but rather a regime of the kind that political scientists call \u201ccompetitive authoritarian\u201d. Yet even there, the opposition managed this month to win the mayoralty of Budapest. They did this by effectively uniting, something not so far achieved by Poland\u2019s opposition parties \u2013 nor, alas, by the opposition to Brexit in Britain. Winning Budapest doesn\u2019t suddenly make Hungary a democracy again, for after all, the Turkish opposition \u2013 by uniting \u2013 won the mayoralty of Istanbul, and no one in their right minds would pretend that the Turkey of Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a democracy. But it is a distinct point of light.\n\nInevitably, the focus of most writing about this 30th anniversary, including my own, has been on the question: \u201cwhat has gone wrong?\u201d But if the post-Wall generation in central Europe fights for the liberties it has grown up with, and the EU starts standing up for democracy in its own member states, there is every reason to believe that the 40th anniversary, in 2029, will again give us cause for celebration.\n\n\u2022 Timothy Garton Ash is a Guardian columnist.
