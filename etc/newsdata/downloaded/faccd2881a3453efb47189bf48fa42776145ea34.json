Sorry to all female athletes who spent their lives mastering their games. Transgender Cyclist Who Set Women's World Record Wouldn't Have Qualified For Men's Championship https://t.co/r6YMS5IYkG \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 21, 2019\n\nAs Breitbart Sports reported on Monday, \u201cMcKinnon, 37, not only set the record in the 35-39 category but also won the 200m gold medal at the Masters Track Cycling World Championships on Sunday. Canadian McKinnon beat out American Dawn Orwick, and Denmark\u2019s Kirsten Herup Sovang, who took silver and bronze behind McKinnon.\n\n\u201cDr. Rachel McKinnon, who was born a man, also won the 2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling World Championships in Los Angeles in 2018, among other events.\u201d\n\nHowever, unlike in many previous incidents, the naturally born female competitors who were defeated by McKinnon did not remain silent.\n\n\u201cIt was an unfair race, and I accepted that when I pinned on the number, and I tried to do my best to overcome the unfairness,\u201d racer Wagner-Assali said of McKinnon\u2019s dominance over natural-born female racers.\n\n\u201cI do feel that hard-fought freedoms for women\u2019s sport are being eroded. If we continue to let this happen, there will be men\u2019s sports and co-ed sports, but there won\u2019t be any women\u2019s sports,\u201d Wagner-Assali added.\n\nMcKinnon, however, denies that he is dominating the women\u2019s sport.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t won any Olympic medals. I haven\u2019t won any elite world championships.\u201d\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightgywinn", "description": "The sports world reacted on Monday to news that transgender cyclist Rachel McKinnon, a biological male, had smashed even more women's", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1138956761-1-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
