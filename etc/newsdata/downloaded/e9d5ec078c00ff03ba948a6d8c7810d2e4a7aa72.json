The Washington Post reported on Monday that NOAA\u2019s chief scientist, Craig McLean, in an email to employees the night before, said that not only was NOAA\u2019s Sept. 6 statement incorrect but that its political nature probably broke rules on science integrity.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political,\u201d he said in the email, adding that the statement from NOAA \u201ccompromises the ability of NOAA to convey life-saving information necessary to avoid substantial and specific danger to public health and safety.\u201d\n\nTherefore, he continued, \u201cI am pursuing the potential violations of our NOAA Administrative Order on Scientific Integrity. I have a responsibility to pursue these truths. I will.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.
