Surrounding it could be other black-owned businesses, largely absent from the city\u2019s south side because banks historically refused to give loans there. Maybe, he thought, the state would give them all tax credits or offer financial assistance to address the past injustice.\n\n\u201cWe could have a little Africa,\u201d said Davis, a 34-year-old liquor store owner who lives a few feet from the highway. \u201cA black liquor store, a black grocery store, a black shopping center \u2014 places that used to exist before the highway.\u201d\n\nFor Davis, reinvestment in his neighborhood is more than a dream; it is a form of reparation, a way for the city to atone for the damage the highway inflicted on this community.\n\nPercent black 0% 20% 40% 60% 80%+ Onondaga Lake Downtown 690 Syracuse Section of Interstate 81 to be removed Syracuse Univ.

But there\u2019s a growing interest, from activists to presidential candidates, to broaden the lens to include disparities in the criminal justice system, access to education and even infrastructure.\n\nThe spine of America \u2014 its railroads, runways and highways \u2014 was often literally built on top of black neighborhoods. Many of those communities had been segregated as a result of redlining and blighted because of a lack of credit. In the 1950s, they were destroyed in the name of urban renewal.\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer Homes housing complex sits a few feet away from an elevated part of highway that may soon be taken down. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nMore than a half-century later, some of those runways and highways are crumbling beyond repair. In Syracuse, residents are trying to leverage officials\u2019 desire to do something about their old road into an opportunity to repair ills of the past.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying that neighborhood that you destroyed was in fact the slums because you made it that way,\u201d said Lanessa Chaplin, a lawyer and organizer with the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cSo now you have to fix it.\u201d\n\nIf the reparations debate in this country continues to move beyond handing out checks, the ensuing debate over Interstate 81 presages a bevy of challenges that await.\n\nSouth side residents who support the decision to take down the highway say simply removing a slab of concrete wouldn\u2019t be enough to undo the damage.\n\nIn a community accustomed to being on the losing end of the government\u2019s ambitions, residents fretted that the city\u2019s plan might leave them worse off.\n\n\u201cWhat going to happen to us?\u201d Bebe Baines, 62, asked her husband, Lloyd, as they sat on their front porch across the street from the highway.\n\n\n\nBebe Baines, left, and husband Lloyd Baines sit with neighbor David Abdul Sabur, center, on their front porch that is only a stone's throw from I-81. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Baines family has lived on the south side for more than 25 years. The homeowners here say they were the best houses that families could get when banks were cautious about lending to African Americans. Neighbors helped each other renovate their kitchens and paint their front porches.\n\nOn this side of the highway, teenagers play basketball steps from I-81\u2019s underbelly. Neighbors complain drug dealers sometimes lurk in the shadows. There are empty roads, some pharmacies and fast-food restaurants, and homes that bare the dust and grime from highway exhaust. The rate of asthma hospitalizations for children are already twice as high in the city as they are in the suburbs.\n\nNew York officials say they are early in the process but have vowed to address the concerns of the south side. They say tearing down the section of road that divides the community will help everyone in the city by removing an unsightly barrier and reducing accidents.\n\nLloyd Baines, 65, was worried, too. On the other side of the highway, developers were building luxury houses for college students and putting up glistening hospital buildings. He\u2019s nervous his neighborhood could be the real estate market\u2019s next frontier if the barrier gets removed.\n\n\u201cIf this place gentrifies, those developers are going to charge whatever they want and raise all my property taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they cared about us, they would freeze our taxes to keep things fair.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the 1950s, New York started knocking down houses on Syracuse's south side to build I-81. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cMaybe they should just buy us out,\u201d said Bebe Baines, who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \u201cCompensate us for everything and then we don\u2019t have to breathe in this bad air anymore. I don\u2019t want to sound grabby, but I just want to make sure we are healthy.\u201d\n\nBehind her, cars zoomed. She looked at her husband and asked: \u201cHave you ever noticed how cities always have a south side?\u201d\n\n*******\n\n\n\nI-81 slices through this predominantly African American community of Victorian-style homes. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nIf not a \u201csouth side,\u201d then a \u201cwest side\u201d or a \u201cneighborhood across the tracks\u201d \u2014 phrases that are less about geography and more of a euphemism for a demographic divide.\n\nThe divide is particularly stark in Syracuse, which has some of the highest concentrations of blacks and Hispanics living in poverty in the country, according to Sally Santangelo, executive director of nonprofit legal group CNY Fair Housing.\n\n\u201cWhen I give presentations in the suburbs, everyone is surprised at the statistic,\u201d Santangelo said. \u201cWhen I give it in the actual city, no one is surprised.\u201d\n\nOne recent evening, Santangelo gave a presentation about the south side\u2019s history at a local library. Before the highway, the area was known as the 15th Ward. It was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood until blacks from the South migrated in the 1900s to seek manufacturing jobs.\n\nEventually, the neighborhood changed. Santangelo pulled up a slide that illustrated why. It showed a copy of a residential covenant prohibiting blacks from moving into a particular neighborhood, then a common practice in Syracuse. Similar restrictions were placed in deeds and in guidelines for real estate agents.\n\nBecause there were few options for African Americans seeking to move out of the 15th Ward, the neighborhood became overwhelmingly black as Jewish families moved away.\n\nSantangelo pulled up another slide. This one showed a color-coded map from 1937 by the federal Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. The banks put a green dot on areas considered low risk \u2014 which signaled an easy process to obtain a loan \u2014 and a red dot on high-risk investments, making it nearly impossible to gain one. A large red band ran through the 15th Ward.\n\n\n\nA color-coded map from 1937 shows red dots meant to represent high-risk investment areas.\n\nUnable to use banks for equity, families in the 15th Ward saw their housing stock fall into blight and disrepair.\n\nWhen the federal government started distributing millions for urban renewal projects, the city declared the redlined areas \u201cslums\u201d and began to clear them out.\n\n\u201cThe same neighborhoods they declared blighted?\u201d one person asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Santangelo said.\n\nShe looked back at the map.\n\n\u201cDoes anyone notice anything about those redlines?\u201d Santangelo asked.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the highway,\u201d someone in the audience said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Santangelo replied. \u201cThat\u2019s where the highways are.\u201d\n\nAs Santangelo ran through the slides, a 73-year-old neighborhood activist, Charlie Pierce-El, ran through his childhood. His was one of those migratory families \u2014 his parents came from Georgia. He remembers other black families planting vegetables in their gardens and setting up businesses of their own. They bought groceries at Mr. Betsy\u2019s and saw Dr. Washington when they weren\u2019t feeling well, or ate at Davis\u2019s restaurant.\n\n\n\nThe Williams brothers stand outside their grocery store in Syracuse's 15th Ward in 1920. The neighborhood was once home to many businesses owned by African Americans.

(Onondaga Historical Association/Onondaga Historical Association)\n\nIn the late 1950s, life got bleak. Pierce-El remembered the stories of people who came home to notice government officials had drawn X\u2019s on their houses, meaning they would have to move to another place. When President Dwight D. Eisenhower started an initiative to build the national highway system, the state knocked down those houses.\n\nSimilar events happened near Lambert International Airport in St. Louis, along the Cypress Freeway in Oakland,, along interstates in Miami and Wilmington, in Nashville, Detroit, Buffalo, New Orleans.\n\nThere were protests in these communities, but the residents had little political power to stop the plans. In a segregated world, it was extraordinarily rare to have black members on the city council or the state transportation boards. And civil rights organizations were consumed by the fight for voting rights.\n\nPierce-El watched the places he loved start to disappear. Soon, there wasn\u2019t a Davis\u2019s restaurant, nor Dr. Washington\u2019s office, nor Mr. Betsy\u2019s grocer.\n\nThe people he loved started to leave, too. Many houses had been replaced with cinder blocks, nuts and bolts to hoist up the highway. With fewer housing options, many found jobs in other redlined towns.\n\nHomes and wealth were lost. Ninety percent of the structures in the 15th Ward were torn down, according to documents for the county\u2019s historic society. Between 400 and 500 businesses were gone. Around 1,200 families were displaced.\n\nWhen housing discrimination became illegal, wealthier white families drove the highway out of town and built up the suburbs. In the city, homes sunk into blight, roads worsened and a resentment festered among black residents.\n\n\u201cThey destroyed the strength and power we had,\u201d Pierce-El said. \u201cThey took it all away.\u201d\n\n\n\nDanny Freeman, 81, and Mike Atkins, 70, right, grew up in the 15th Ward until the neighborhood was razed to build I-81. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nToward the end of the Obama administration, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx initiated a \u201cdesign challenge\u201d for communities to help mitigate the impact of infrastructure projects on low-income communities. The program was not revived during the Trump administration, which has preferred to attempt to boost investment in low-income neighborhoods through tax breaks in economically distressed areas it has labeled \u201cOpportunity Zones.\u201d\n\nAs Democratic presidential candidates respond to the questions about their thoughts on reparations, many home in on segregated communities like the south side.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has called for increasing access to credit in black communities and increasing training for black entrepreneurs. Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) want to offer tax credits for low- and middle-income families that they say would decrease the racial wealth gap.\n\nSens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have addressed the impact of redlining. Former vice president Joe Biden has said he is interested in studying the issue of giving checks to descendants of slaves, but supports \u201ctak[ing] action to deal with the systemic things that still exist in housing and insurance and a whole range of things that make it harder for African Americans.\u201d\n\nOne of those things is the highway.\n\n***\n\nCapone, Celeste Wallace and 3-year-old Ezekiel Wallace sit on their porch at Pioneer Homes.

Davis and his mother sold dinners from their home and held barbecues for the children around the neighborhood who had grown used to playing in the shadows of the highway.\n\n\u201cI used to think it was just normal living by a highway,\u201d said Davis, who grew up with asthma. \u201cBut now I think about all its effects and how it influenced my family. It needs to come down.\u201d\n\nIf the plans proceed, four buildings, none of them historic, would have to be knocked down, according to an early state project report. The state would offer families hotel rooms for days when they are at risk of breathing in bad air. And meetings are being held throughout the area to incorporate community feedback so the Transportation Department can assure residents that this infrastructure project won\u2019t be like the last.\n\nOne recent afternoon, Bebe and Lloyd Baines drove to attend a meeting about I-81 at the city convention center. A small band of protesters with \u201cSave I-81!\u201d signs stood outside.\n\nMost of the protesters were from the suburbs, worried that the removal of the highway would tie them up in traffic and elongate their commutes.\n\n\u201cI find that complaint offensive,\u201d Lloyd Baines said. \u201cOur community is the one that has been suffering.\u201d\n\nInside, there were more than 1,000 people, walking around large poster boards of traffic grids. The charts they saw focused on estimated changes to commute times from the suburbs. The Baines couple didn\u2019t see any poster boards on the noise, the environmental hazards, the taxes, the trauma. For them, it felt like other communities\u2019 needs were again being placed ahead of their own.\n\n\n\nUntil becoming aware of the dangers of living in close proximity to traffic fumes, Ryedell Davis said he thought his asthma was hereditary.

He described the plan to reroute traffic to a business loop on the outskirts of the city.\n\nHe spoke for about five minutes. This meeting, Frechette told the audience, was just the beginning of a years-long community process to reimagine the city. After he spoke, official after official reiterated the same message to the crowd: \u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation opportunity.\u201d\n\nLloyd Baines looked at Bebe. Soon, they were on their way back home and back to their rocking chairs on the front porch, with the same question they had when they left: An opportunity for whom?", "description": "This city's south side was devastated when a highway section went up.
