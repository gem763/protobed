Hasbro fell more than 10% after the toy maker's third-quarter revenue disappointed investors.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index was also mostly flat as Brexit uncertainty weighed on investor appetite ahead of another day of voting by U.K. lawmakers on the terms of the nation's exit from the European Union.\n\n\"Investors want to keep the status quo unless proven otherwise,\" said Geoffrey Yu, head of the U.K. investment office at USB Wealth Management. \"They have learned with trade talks and Brexit, if you try and position too aggressively for the downside, you might just get smacked in the face.\"\n\nThe British pound was flat against the dollar.
