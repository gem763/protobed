Buried at the end of a new book that attempts to resurrect the sexual-assault claims against Brett Kavanaugh, the authors include an important rebuttal witness. For the first time, Christine Blasey Ford friend Leland Keyser not only denies knowing anything about the party and the alleged assault, she told the reporter that she hasn\u2019t \u201cany confidence\u201d in her friend\u2019s credibility on the issue.\n\nMollie Hemingway made the find in reviewing the book:\n\nBuried at the end of their new book \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\u201d reporters Robin Pogebrin and Kate Kelly quietly admit that Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s lifelong friend Leland Keyser did not believe her friend\u2019s tale of a sexual assault at a party they both supposedly attended. Keyser was named by Ford as a witness, one of four who denied any knowledge of the event in question. The book offers no evidence in support of the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford, but, they write, their \u201cgut reaction\u201d was that her allegations \u201crang true.\u201d Their \u201cgut\u201d instinct was based on the fact that Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh grew up in the same rough area and she had dated one of his friends. Further, Leland Keyser had gone out on a date \u2014 maybe even two dates, they\u2019re not sure \u2014 with a friend of Kavanaugh\u2019s. \u201cNone of that means that Ford was, in fact, assaulted by Kavanaugh,\u201d they write, \u201cBut it does mean that she has a baseline level of credibility as an accuser.\u201d It is unclear what they mean.\n\nFor those who do not recall Keyser, Blasey Ford had told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was one of four people who could corroborate her claim against Kavanaugh. None of the four did, but Keyser got more attention than the other three. At the time, Keyser refused to participate but only issued a vague demurral through her attorney about not being able to recollect the incident:\n\nOn Saturday night, her lawyer, Howard Walsh, released a statement to CNN and the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cSimply put,\u201d Walsh said, \u201cMs. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.\u201d\n\nBlasey Ford\u2019s legal team tried to spin that away, even though they had named Keyser in the first place as a corroborating witness:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that Ms Keyser has no recollection of the evening as they did not discuss it,\u201d Katz said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s also unremarkable that Ms. Keyser does not remember attending a specific gathering 30 years ago at which nothing of consequence happened to her. Dr. Ford of course will never forget this gathering because of what happened to her there.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Blasey Ford turns out to be bigger than that. Not only does Keyser not recall any such incident, she also doubts that it ever took place at all. The authors bury this blurb at the end, but only after extolling Blasey Ford\u2019s credibility and their own \u201cgut instinct\u201d:\n\nWe spoke multiple times to Keyser, who also said that she didn\u2019t recall that get-together or any others like it. In fact, she challenged Ford\u2019s accuracy. \u201cI don\u2019t have any confidence in the story.\u201d\n\nWait \u2014 what? The authors\u2019 \u201cgut instinct\u201d that Blasey Ford told the truth was supposedly formed at least in part on Keyser\u2019s connection to Kavanaugh. If Keyser \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any confidence\u201d in Blasey Ford\u2019s story \u2014 even though Blasey Ford explicitly named her as a witness and a character reference \u2014 why do the authors continue to treat Blasey Ford credibly? For that matter, why does anyone else?\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget the massive amount of pressure Keyser felt to offer up corroborative testimony to support Blasey Ford. Her allies \u2014 and Kavanaugh\u2019s enemies \u2014 were desperate to get enough for Blasey Ford to pressure Senate Republicans into abandoning Kavanaugh and forcing his withdrawal. As reported at the time by the Wall Street Journal, it bordered on witness tampering and resulted in a second-hand comment from Keyser at the time that she \u201cbelieved\u201d Blasey Ford. Not only has that proven untrue, Mollie explains that the pressure was much heavier and heavier-handed than was known at the time:\n\n\u201cI was told behind the scenes that certain things could be spread about me if I didn\u2019t comply,\u201d Keyser told the reporters, a stunning admission of the pressure to which she was subjected to by Blasey Ford\u2019s allies.\n\nIn other words, all of this from Keyser is testimony against interests. She had been lifelong friends with Blasey Ford and her circle; Keyser also opposed Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment; she has to worry still about the rumor mill generating allegations about her own conduct to degrade her (minimal) public persona. Not only did Keyser stick to her guns despite all of that, she actually warned the authors not to take Blasey Ford\u2019s word. Coming on top of the stunning story about Blasey Ford\u2019s father and the political motives behind her attack, it\u2019s beginning to look like those who knew Blasey Ford best knew better than to take her at her word.\n\nRather than taking Keyser\u2019s advice, the authors ignored her while using Keyser indirectly to argue for Blasey Ford\u2019s credibility. That\u2019s not journalism \u2014 it\u2019s mindless advocacy and demagoguery. Or, as John Ziegler put it, a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d over having lost the Kavanaugh war a year ago:", "description": "Mindless demagoguery.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Blasey-Ford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
