Just as the fans swelled to sing along, the video changed to Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up,\" effectively \"Rick Rolling\" the Steelers supporters in attendance.\n\nThe decision was not appreciated by some of the Chargers players.\n\n\"It was crazy,\" running back Melvin Gordon said, according to Jeff Miller of the Los Angeles Times. \"They started playing their theme music. I don't know what we were doing \u2014 that little soundtrack, what they do on their home games. I don't know why we played that.\"\n\nOffensive lineman Forrest Lamp went a step further. \"We're used to not having any fans here,\" Lamp said. \"It does suck, though, when they're playing their music in the fourth quarter. We're the ones at home. I don't know who's in charge of that, but they probably should be fired.\"\n\nPranks like the one the stadium pulled off on Sunday have become more and more common in recent years, giving opposing fans a light jab from the home crowd. That said, the joke plays a bit differently when the stadium is almost entirely filled with fans of the road team.\n\nThe Chargers home-field woes aren't likely to improve anytime soon, with upcoming games against the Packers and Chiefs in Los Angeles \u2014 two teams with fans that travel well. After the Chargers' reaction to this week's game, the stadium might be a bit more careful about any in-arena jokes or at least be sure the home team is winning before playing them.\n\nThe Eagles defense called Kirk Cousins the 'weakest part' of the Vikings offense and he made them pay\n\nTop 13 waiver-wire pickups for Week 7 of fantasy football\n\nPope Francis accidentally tweeted in support of the New Orleans Saints thanks to a hashtag snafu\n\nGardner Minshew is said to be a fantasy-football savant but refuses to pick himself", "description": "The Chargers haven't had a home-field advantage since moving to Los Angeles, but Sunday's game against the Steelers was especially brutal.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4d2ff4af9092489483297?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
