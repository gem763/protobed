Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nFor the second time as president, Donald Trump tweeted \u201cbullshit\u201d Wednesday. As in the word bullshit. The first time he used the noun in a presidential tweet came in April, when he referred to claims in Robert Mueller\u2019s report as \u201ctotal bullshit.\u201d (Things he labeled \u201cbullshit\u201d prior to becoming president include climate change, the Oscars, and a New York story about Roger Ailes.)\n\nWednesday\u2019s tweet was the first time he made the \u201cBULLSHIT\u201d all caps, though.\n\n\u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country,\u201d Trump wrote, \u201cnot wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306. Get a better candidate this time, you\u2019ll need it!\u201d\n\nThe Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nThe tweet, in which Trump gets Hillary Clinton\u2019s electoral-vote total wrong, was made even more amusing by what happened next. While sitting next to Finland\u2019s president in the Oval Office, Trump ranted about San Francisco, Nancy Pelosi, and \u201cShifty\u201d Adam Schiff. At one point he tore into Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, for not sufficiently respecting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\u201cYou know, there\u2019s an expression,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t carry his \u2018blank\u2019 strap. I won\u2019t say it because they\u2019ll say it was so terrible to say. But that guy couldn\u2019t carry his \u2018blank\u2019 strap,\u201d Trump said, refusing to say jockstrap.\n\nTrump\u2019s prudishness in that moment, which came just minutes after he tweeted \u201cBULLSHIT,\u201d is just the latest mystery to surround a man who becomes more inscrutable by the day.\n\nFuming, Trump rants that Adam Schiff couldnt carry Mike Pompeo's \"blank strap\" (jock strap) pic.twitter.com/qpvvIjCHZR \u2014 Oliver Willis (@owillis) October 2, 2019", "description": "Donald Trump tweeted the word \u201cbullshit\u201d Wednesday, but then in the Oval Office he censored himself, saying \u201c\u2019blank\u2019 strap\u201d instead of \u201cjockstrap.\u201d", "authors": ["Adam K.
