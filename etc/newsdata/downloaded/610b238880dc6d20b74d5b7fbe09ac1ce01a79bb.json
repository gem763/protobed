Discontinued nail polish can be astonishingly lucrative, but not these colors. A dinosaur riding some sort of motorcycle? No way. But these Jurassic Park Jeeps look promising, and an Amazon app on his phone confirms that each could net a $6 profit after fees and shipping. He piles all 20 into his cart.\n\nIt\u2019s not a bad haul for a half-hour\u2019s work, but it\u2019s not great either. He consoles himself that he hit upon a trove of deeply discounted Kohl\u2019s bras the day before as he left East Brunswick, New Jersey, on his way here to Edison. Home is still 300 miles away, in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, and there are plenty of stores between here and there.\n\nAnderson is an Amazon nomad, part of a small group of merchants who travel the backroads of America searching clearance aisles and dying chains for goods to sell on Amazon. Some live out of RVs and vans, moving from town to town, only stopping long enough to pick the stores clean and ship their wares to Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers.\n\n\u201cI love living on wheels.\u201d\n\nThe majority of goods sold on Amazon are not sold by Amazon itself, but by more than 2 million merchants who use the company\u2019s platform as their storefront and infrastructure. Some of these sellers make their own products, while others practice arbitrage, buying and reselling wares from other retailers. Amazon has made this easy to do, first by launching Fulfillment by Amazon, which allows sellers to send their goods to company warehouses and have Amazon handle storage and delivery, and then with an app that lets sellers scan goods to instantly check whether they\u2019d be profitable to sell on the site. A few sellers, like Anderson, have figured out that the best way to find lucrative products is to be mobile, scouring remote stores and chasing hot-selling items from coast to coast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like I\u2019m the front end of the business and Amazon is just an extension of my arm,\u201d says Sean-Patrick Iles, a nomad who spent weeks driving cross-country during Toys R Us\u2019 final days. It was a feeding frenzy Anderson and others also hit the road for. \u201cI find the products, and then they mail them to people.\u201d\n\nThough nomadism offers competitive advantages, most of the merchants I spoke with cited more personal reasons for their professions.\n\n\u201cI love living on wheels,\u201d says Rose Pile, who travels in an RV with her husband and four sons. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like your neighbors, if you don\u2019t like your location, you just move.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best part is just seeing the country,\u201d says Jamison Philippi, who recently spent nine months on the road clearing out closing Toys R Us stores. In 2014, he was sleeping on a yoga mat on a friend\u2019s floor in Nashville and struggling to find work. He never took vacations growing up and always wanted to travel. Amazon selling seemed like a solution to both problems. In the last three years, he estimates he\u2019s shopped in 45 states.\n\nHe figured he might as well keep driving \u2014 to Wisconsin, to Florida, to Nevada\n\n\u201cFreedom,\u201d Jason Wyatt quickly answers when I ask him why he decided to quit his job as an aviation electronics technician, sell his house in Georgia, and buy an RV. \u201cJanis Joplin once said \u2014 though I believe it was actually Kris Kristofferson\u2019s song \u2014 \u2018freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.\u2019 And I found that that\u2019s actually the truth. Your possessions, you don\u2019t really own them. They own you. The more you get rid of, the freer you are.\u201d\n\nThis is not an uncommon refrain from the nomads, who often have a complicated relationship with consumerism. Too much stuff can be a burden on the road, so they can find themselves living like ascetics amid the clearance aisles, servicing, in Anderson\u2019s words, \u201cliterally the best product distribution system ever devised by the human race.\u201d\n\nAt 32, Anderson is burly with a youthful face and shoulder-length dark hair tucked behind his ears. His black shorts and T-shirt reveal tattoos of aliens, cats, skulls, and iconography from Radiohead and Misfits. Coupled with the white windowless cargo van he drives, the whole ensemble gives him the appearance of a cheerful roadie, one of the many jobs he\u2019s briefly held.\n\nAnderson adopted the nomadic life partly out of necessity. A restless person by his own admission, he dropped out of college three years in, getting all the debt without the degree. He started making jewelry \u2014 wedding bands and titanium plugs, like the Space Invaders ones he\u2019s now wearing \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t enough to live on. He worked retail. He worked in a call center. Then, looking for ways to sell his jewelry, he came across Amazon. It was a terrible platform for selling crafts. He couldn\u2019t make things fast enough to meet Amazon\u2019s requirements, but retail arbitrage looked interesting. He moved to Tyrone, and the nearest Walmart was 20 miles away, so any shopping trips would have to be road trips anyway. He figured he might as well keep driving \u2014 to Wisconsin, to Florida, to Nevada. Today, he runs a warehouse, packing products for other Amazon sellers, and spends half his time on the road chasing product.\n\nWhen you spend weeks on end traveling the strip malls and big-box stores of America, you start to appreciate small differences in what can seem like archipelagos of sameness: the way the Targets get cleaner as you approach corporate headquarters in Minneapolis; the novelty of an unusually small Walmart in Indiana; the McDonald\u2019s in Pomeroy, Ohio, that served pizza, the remainder of an abandoned experiment in the \u201880s.\n\nHow was the McPizza?\n\n\u201cBad!\u201d Anderson says exuberantly. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the point.\u201d\n\nFinished with Target, Anderson stacks the Jeeps in the back of his van and gives the cart a shove, sending it rattling into its corral. Sometimes, he confides, when he finishes shopping late at night, he\u2019ll bump his cart with his van to knock it into its pen as he leaves, a parting flourish in the empty lot.\n\nThere are a couple of ways a trip can go. Right now, Anderson is just browsing, something he does wherever he goes. Because these sorts of stores blanket the country, Amazon nomads often travel aimlessly.\n\n\u201cWhen I come up to Interstate 80,\u201d says Chris Bond, a part-time nomad based in Nebraska, \u201cthere\u2019s been a number of times I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going east or west. It\u2019s just whatever feels right when I get there. If I end up going west, I just make a big old loop out west. Or when I leave town, if I miss my road just because I wasn\u2019t paying attention, it\u2019s no big deal because there\u2019s plenty of stores in whatever direction I\u2019m going.\u201d\n\nBond chose to be homeless for several years in the \u201890s while he bounced around the country going to Grateful Dead and Phish shows, but he no longer listens to music on the road, preferring to drive in silence. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice quiet time to contemplate where I\u2019m going in life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a number of times I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going east or west. It\u2019s just whatever feels right when I get there.\u201d\n\nLike many nomadic sellers, Bond sticks to back roads and remote locations, avoiding the city centers that have been \u201cstomped on\u201d by other arbitrageurs. Anderson stays off the interstate, too. Others only shop at least an hour outside of town, or they seek out stores in places you\u2019d only visit on your way to somewhere else. \u201cIf you get off the beaten path and into these other locations, you\u2019re bound to hit little honey holes of completely untouched inventory,\u201d Bond says.\n\nOften, sellers will invent destinations to give their travels a direction. Anderson likes to follow bands. He recently followed The Mountain Goats across four states and is planning to do the same this summer when Tool goes on tour. Some, like Jonathan Baron, a former tattoo artist and part-time nomad, caravan to Amazon seller conventions with what he calls his \u201cAmazon travel tribe.\u201d National parks are a popular destination, which can create a distinctly American-feeling juxtaposition of natural splendor and commerce, big stores and open sky. Iles reminisces about waking up in his van to see the sun rising over the Grand Canyon after a weeks-long tour of closing Toys R Us stores. Pile recalls the sunsets over the Walmart parking lots in New Hampshire or a Black Friday run through Florida that ended with the family boxing up Skylanders: Imaginators toys on the shores of Key West. Anderson takes detours for roadside attractions like the largest basket in Ohio, and he always stops for caves.\n\nBut sometimes the Amazon app, acting as a Geiger counter of consumer demand, will light up on something strange, and it\u2019s time to chase a product. Anderson recently hit half a dozen Walmarts buying Game of Thrones Oreos. Baron discovered the Oreos, too: \u201cWe had to hustle really hard, just driving from city to city, filling up the vehicle with every one of these Oreos we could get.\u201d Bond remembers answering the call of a \u201cridiculous\u201d deal Kmart ran on certain headphones. \u201cI bought every one across the front range from Pueblo, Colorado, all the way up to Cheyenne,\u201d he says.\n\nYou learn to develop an eye for things that could set off the scanner, and it\u2019s not always the cross-branded cookie from a $26 billion food conglomerate and $195 billion telecom company.\n\n\u201cOoh, weird cleaning products \u2014 I love \u2018em,\u201d Anderson says as he leaves a TJ Maxx aisle full of plastic avocado-half containers and Jim Beam-branded steak knives. There are objects that are intentionally scarce and marketed as such, like the Oreos, and then there are everyday things that simply vanish in the churn of seasonal redesigns and obsolescence. The attachments people develop for these unremarkable commodities can be intense, at least as measured by their prices on Amazon. For Anderson, the holy grail is the Bounce Dryer Bar, a $5 plastic oblong you affix to the dryer rather than adding a dryer sheet to each load. Now discontinued, a two-pack sells on Amazon for $300.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t realize how isolating it can be at times.\u201d\n\nDiscontinued nail polish, Pop-Tarts, hair curling products: Anderson has chased them all when the scanner has shown them fetching multiples of their normal price. He once hunted a particular brand of discontinued dental floss across the Big Lots of America, buying six-packs for 99 cents and selling them on Amazon for over $100 apiece.\n\nHe has no idea why someone would pay so much for such things, but the scanner tells him people do. His best guesses are melancholy ones. Discontinued cat food is a big seller, which he didn\u2019t understand until his mom\u2019s cat grew old and senile and refused to eat any of the new flavors. He once saw a post from a parent whose son was autistic and drank from the same plastic cup every day for 20 years. The cup eventually disintegrated, and he didn\u2019t want to drink from any other vessel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wondered if it\u2019s something like that,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be that common. Plus, I don\u2019t see how you get that attached to it. I can see a cup, but I don\u2019t get a dryer bar.\u201d In any case, demand exists. Someone bought a $300 dryer bar last month.\n\nPile, who travels with her family in an RV, specializes in these discontinued products. She focuses on remote chain outposts, seeking obsolete Sony iPhone docks, Scrubbing Bubbles pads with last season\u2019s scent, and Walmart pajama bottoms that customers say were softer in years past. \u201cIf somebody likes a certain scent or how something works, they become loyal to that item, even if just the packaging has changed. They can no longer find that item in a store, and Amazon is one place they\u2019ll look for it. It\u2019s people like us who travel around that can find it.\u201d\n\nLife on the road isn\u2019t easy. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize how isolating it can be at times,\u201d says Iles, who travels between New York and Florida in a Ford conversion van. Most social interactions are fleeting ones with cashiers, and being constantly on the move makes it difficult to form friendships. Anderson thinks the constant travel is part of why his marriage ended.\n\nIn lieu of neighbors and co-workers, many nomads form Facebook groups and chats with fellow sellers. Iles has Monday night conference calls with a group of sellers, and he recently upgraded his van stereo so that he can chat while on the road. Anderson plays Counter-Strike with a group of friends after checking into his hotel for the night, and he has a collection of sellers scattered across the country that he gets drinks with when he\u2019s passing through.\n\nThere are other challenges: breakdowns, bad weather, decrepit accommodations. You need to be vigilant about bed bugs, says Philippi, speaking from experience. Law enforcement sometimes takes an interest in people loading dozens of game consoles into vans late at night. Philippi now avoids Airbnbs after suspicious neighbors called the police on him multiple times.\n\nIt also takes a tremendous amount of work to be financially viable. While there is a robust economy of influencers promising riches through retail arbitrage, the actual margins are unforgiving, and the practice has been declining for years.\n\nWeird cereal can be lucrative\n\nIles, who was studying to be a music teacher before he decided it wasn\u2019t a viable career, pays himself about $40,000 a year and works long and strange hours, sometimes overturning shopping carts in Walmart parking lots at 3AM to serve as makeshift countertops as he packages goods to send to Amazon. Anderson says he makes \u201cabout $100,000\u201d a year, of which arbitrage represents roughly half. \u201cI\u2019ve mentored quite a few people,\u201d says Pile, \u201cand a lot of people don\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nThe nomads must also endure the overwhelming feeling of being confronted with so much stuff. I started to experience this as the afternoon wore on. By 4PM, Anderson and I had been to Target, Ulta, TJ Maxx, Walmart, Kohl\u2019s, and had moved on to GameStop. We had seen quivers of yoga mats, pro-wrestling action figures, vast Nerf arsenals, and copper-plated pans that Anderson fondly recalled he\u2019d once bought so many of that Kohl\u2019s banned him from its website. There were plush Star Wars droids, plastic dinosaurs, Sour Patch cereal, Churro Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal (weird cereal can be lucrative, Anderson says), Elmos, Teddy Ruxpins, glittering purple bath bombs, body mist that a rival seller had registered as weighing 500 pounds so the scanner app registered it as unprofitable, skull-covered American Sniper-branded car seat covers with gun holsters, plastic succulents, TVs, drones, and a toy that was labeled simply \u201cegg.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of weird parent gets their kid an egg?\u201d Anderson asks.\n\nPerusing the clearance racks at GameStop, Anderson passed over a Stranger Things card game involving Eggo waffles (\u201cThere was a year that these were like 50 bucks on Amazon,\u201d he reminisces), a rubber skillet somehow related to the game PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds (\u201cI love that game, and even I have no idea who would buy that\u201d), and a Monopoly-branded toy gun that shoots hundred-dollar bills. There were rubber robot-monkey dolls called Fingerlings, which were so popular in 2017 that arbitrageurs made bots to buy them and incurred the wrath of Sen. Chuck Schumer. Here, they were half off by the rack. Anderson picked up a Red Dead Redemption 2-scented candle in the shape of a barrel, originally $100. \u201cConsumerism, man,\u201d he says, putting it back after his scanner told him it wasn\u2019t worth it, even at half off.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing quite like a clearance section for feeling the intensity and fleetingness of consumer desire: all these plastic leftovers of huge public appetites, which were shaped for a time by enormous companies and have since moved on to robot monkey finger puppets or whatever. The scale is overwhelming. Anderson recalls an auction for pallets of robotic hamsters called ZhuZhu Pets, which were briefly hot in 2009, with a Disney Channel cartoon and video games. The pallet was number 20,000. \u201cThat means somebody imported 20,000 pallets at least. That is an insane number.\u201d Doing the math, he comes up with almost 800 tractor-trailers full of robot hamsters that had become so unprofitable on Amazon that he told the auctioneer he wouldn\u2019t take them if he was paid to.\n\n\u201cI need more stuff, more stuff, more stuff.\u201d\n\nI was surprised at first by how often the nomads distanced themselves from material culture, speaking of their customers and fellow shoppers from an almost anthropological remove. But it makes sense when you realize that they make most of their money by immersing themselves in the pre-holiday buying frenzy. Anderson has Thanksgiving with his mom a day early so he can venture out to the stores, a tradition that dates back to his time working retail. He always brings a buddy; it\u2019s too harrowing to face alone. He\u2019s seen hungry-eyed adults fighting over TVs and parents crying out in desperation that, without a particular toy, their kid\u2019s Christmas will be ruined.\n\n\u201cToo many people are unhappy, and I don\u2019t think they know why they\u2019re unhappy, so they\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m going to buy a new toy, and that\u2019ll make me happy,\u2019 and it does not,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many people are owned by their possessions.\u201d\n\nThe holiday crush is part of what led Wyatt, one of the first traveling arbitrageurs, to reduce his Amazon dealings to books, making up the rest of his income in itinerant business consulting. \u201cThis consumerism mindset starts at Christmastime,\u201d Wyatt says, with a southern drawl. \u201cIt\u2019s all teaching kids consumerism: I need more stuff, more stuff, more stuff. It\u2019s not like I was against it. It just didn\u2019t fit well. So when I figured out how I could make money helping people, that\u2019s what I did. And the book thing, I mean books are knowledge, and I don\u2019t mind so much passing on the knowledge to those who want it.\u201d\n\nPile, a mentee of Wyatt\u2019s, finds the frenzy just as bewildering, though she\u2019s more comfortable with her role in it. \u201cEspecially quarter four and Christmas, with the amount of toys and things we see, people buy a lot of things that they don\u2019t really need,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gets pretty amazing, the value people put on things and what someone is willing to pay for something. And that\u2019s okay, that\u2019s what they value, that\u2019s what they want to hold on to, that\u2019s what they need in their life. And I\u2019m here to try and provide that as best I can.\u201d\n\nThe travel, shopping frenzies, and financial unpredictability all take their toll, and many of the resellers I spoke with had become somewhat less nomadic recently. Pile\u2019s four sons had gotten too big for their motorhome and she recently \u201cstopped our wheels from rolling\u201d and bought a house in Tennessee. For now, she\u2019s taking long RV trips for goods, but she hopes to get back on the road full-time once her kids are grown. Philippi bought a house in New Jersey to use as a home base after three years without a fixed address. Bond has settled down, too, only traveling long distances for the fourth quarter pre-holiday spree.\n\nAnderson is still eager to travel, he says, as we sit outside at a Starbucks along a busy road, cars whooshing home in the evening rush hour. He\u2019s had depression for a lot of his life, and when he\u2019s traveling is when he\u2019s happiest. Yesterday, he drove through the Pine Barrens, which was beautiful. Tonight, he might drive down to Philadelphia and see his dad or up through Jersey to get dinner with Philippi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice to just be carefree, you know? I\u2019m gonna see.\u201d\n\nThen it\u2019s probably off to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he recently hit a rich vein of discontinued Pop-Tarts.", "description": "To stock Amazon\u2019s shelves, nomadic merchants travel the backroads of America in search of rare soap and coveted toys.
