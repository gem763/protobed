Getty Images 6/21 Neal Maupay (Brighton & Hove Albion) Brighton's \u00a316m summer signing is still working to consolidate his place in Graham Potter's preferred starting XI.

CameraSport via Getty Images 7/21 Lewis Cook (Bournemouth) The midfielder is yet to feature this season as he continues his comeback from knee ligament damage.

AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images 8/21 Matty Longstaff (Newcastle United) Newcastle have something of an injury crisis on their hands for their trip to Liverpool, with as many as seven first-team players absent.

He has scored four goals in four appearances for Burnley. CameraSport via Getty Images 11/21 Willian (Chelsea) Willian is yet to start a competitive match under Frank Lampard but is in line to start against Wolves on Saturday. Chelsea desperate need him to hit the ground running, which will be difficult considering his lack of pre-season. Getty 12/21 Lys Mousset (Sheffield United) There are question marks over the fitness of David McGoldrick and Callum Robinson, who were both withdrawn from international duty recently, meaning Lys Mousset could be handed a start. REUTERS 13/21 Christian Eriksen (Tottenham Hotspur) Christian Eriksen failed to secure a move away from Spurs ahead of the European transfer deadline and will stay on in north London, although he has yet to sign a new deal with the club. \"He never said he was not happy here - he always was,\" Mauricio Pochettino said this weekend. \"I said before the Arsenal game that he was in the right mind - that's why I selected him for that game and I will continue to select him. He has always been such an important player for us and he will continue to be.\" Getty Images 14/21 Juan Mata (Manchester United) Manchester United's injury crisis means that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is likely to turn to the 31-year-old for the visit of Leicester City this weekend. Getty Images 15/21 Manuel Lanzini (West Ham United) Manuel Lanzini is set to start for West Ham against Aston Villa - although only rejoined his team-mates on Friday, having undertaken a 10,000-mile round trip to make a 13-minute substitute appearance for Argentina in their 4-0 win against Mexico in Texas on Wednesday. West Ham United FC via Getty Ima 16/21 Michael Keane (Everton) Michael Keane is another player who will hope to shrug off the international break when he returns to domestic duty this weekend.

REUTERS 17/21 Nicolas Pepe (Arsenal) With Alexandre Lacazette still struggling to regain fitness, Nicolas Pepe is likely to start against Watford.

Arsenal FC via Getty Images 18/21 Jordan Ayew (Crystal Palace) The 28-year-old was named Crystal Palace's player of the month after scoring twice in three games for the club. He will hope to continue his scoring streak when Palace play Spurs, and given Tottenham's recent form, will surely find himself with ample opportunities on the counter-attack. Getty Images 19/21 James Maddison (Manchester United) Manchester United sniffed around James Maddison this summer, ultimately deciding against bidding for the 22-year-old. But the speculation has persisted and all eyes will be on the midfielder at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon. PA 20/21 Kyle Walker (Manchester City) The 29-year-old was left out of Gareth Southgate's recent England squad, with Kieran Trippier and Trent Alexander-Arnold preferred.

But I said to you, it's not easy.\n\n\"When it's one player (who wants to leave), OK, but when it's a few players, who start to make it difficult to create a good dynamic, a positive dynamic, but now it's to be positive.\n\n\"Now we need to start to win games. That is our objective. Be refocused and who is not refocused is going to be out.\"\n\nAsked if he has any doubts over Eriksen's commitment, Pochettino bristled and insisted he is 100 per cent focused.\n\nWith Giovani Lo Celso out injured with a hip problem until the end of October, the creative onus will remain on Tottenham's Danish playmaker.\n\nEven though Eriksen is free to talk to other clubs in January about a move next summer, Pochettino knows he can rely on him to deliver for Spurs.\n\nHe added: \"You cannot doubt about the player's commitment. When you sign the contract, like Christian who signed for five or six years, you need to be committed from day one to the last day.\n\n\"Because there's only one year left on the contract, he's not going to show the commitment? I think he's showing his commitment by playing football.\n\n\"Difference is whether he wants to extend the contract or not. Different players have different goals.\n\n\"The problem with football, the business, managers, staff, players, no one is going to say 'I want to leave the club.' Then if no one wants me, then you say 'no, no, I love the club.'\n\n\"You shoot yourself, you kill yourself. Come on, you're like me, you know the business. That is why after what is said, there is a lot of history, the reality is the manager, players, coaching staff, they have one year and they are so happy here and another they need a different challenge.\n\n\"We are the first, the manager, the coaching staff, but always it's about how you manage and how you use it to be in a good position.\"", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino is positive about what Tottenham Hotspur can achieve over the coming months with the transfer window now shut and no distractions affecting his squad.
