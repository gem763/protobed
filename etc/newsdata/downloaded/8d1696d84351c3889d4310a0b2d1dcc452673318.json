He renounced his US citizenship in May of this year.\n\nSri Lanka does not allow dual citizens or non-citizens to contest national elections.\n\nA spokesman for Rajapaksa, Keheliya Rambukwella, said the decision was a \"victory for the nation and democracy\".\n\nNamed by the main opposition Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party as its presidential candidate last month, Mr Rajapaksa also faces uncertainty over a legal battle regarding misappropriation of funds.\n\nStill, Mr Rajapaksa's popularity has grown in recent months, especially after it emerged that the government had failed to act on repeated intelligence warnings from India ahead of the Easter blasts, which were claimed by the militant group Islamic State.\n\nSLPP chairman GL Peiris said the court case showed a plot by opponents to stop Mr Rajapaksa winning the Nov 16 poll.\n\nSupporters of the SLPP welcomed the decision with firecrackers in capital Colombo after the judgement was delivered in a packed court room following a three-day hearing.\n\nMost Buddhist leaders, and some victims of the Easter attacks, have since expressed their desire for the Rajapaksa family to return to power.\n\nThe activists who filed the petition were Gamini Viyangoda, an official of a citizens' group and Chandraguptha Thenuwara, an artist and lecturer. They say they are campaigners for democracy, good governance and rule of law.\n\nIn the 2015 presidential election, they backed the winner, Maithripala Sirisena, against Mahinda Rajapaksa, a pro-China strongman.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [COLOMBO] A Sri Lankan court on Friday dismissed a legal challenge to presidential candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa's Sri Lankan citizenship, removing a major barrier he faced in contesting the Nov 16 poll. .
