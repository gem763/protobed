Adam Schiff, D-Calif., talks to the media after Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Sunday that he expects the whistleblower at the heart of impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump to testify \"very soon.\"\n\n\"All that needs to be done, at this point, is to make sure that the attorneys that represent the whistleblower get the clearances that they need to be able to accompany the whistleblower to testimony,\" said Schiff, D-Calif., \"and that we figure out the logistics to make sure that we protect the identity of the whistleblower.\"\n\nAs Democrats and the director of national intelligence worked out key arrangements, Trump's allies erupted in a surge of second-guessing and conspiracy theorizing across the Sunday talk shows, suggesting the White House strategy is unclear against the stiffest challenge to his presidency. One former adviser urged Trump to confront the crisis at hand and get past his fury over the probe of Russian election interference.\n\n\"I honestly believe this president has not gotten his pound of flesh yet from past grievances on the 2016 investigation,\" said Tom Bossert, Trump's former homeland security adviser. \"If he continues to focus on that white whale,\" Bossert added, \"it's going to bring him down.\"\n\nThe Ukraine investigation produced what the Russian probe did not: formal House impeachment proceedings based on the president's own words and actions.\n\nThe White House last week released a rough transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as well as the whistleblower's complaint alleging the U.S. president pressured his counterpart to investigate the family of Joe Biden, the former vice president who is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump's reelection next year.\n\nIn a series of tweets Sunday night, Trump said he deserved to meet \"my accuser\" as well as whoever provided the whistleblower with what the president called \"largely incorrect\" information. He also accused Democrats of \"doing great harm to our Country\" in an effort to destabilize the nation and the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has sought to implicate Biden and his son Hunter Biden in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either of the Bidens.\n\nThe House forged ahead, with Schiff's committee leading the investigation. Democrats are planning a rapid start to their push for impeachment, with hearings and depositions starting this week. Many Democrats are pushing for a vote on articles of impeachment before the end of the year, mindful of the looming 2020 elections.\n\nSchiff has said the whistleblower has agreed to testify, but the logistics involving security had yet to be set.\n\nOn a conference call later Sunday, Pelosi, who was traveling in Texas, urged Democrats to proceed \"not with negative attitudes towards him, but a positive attitude towards our responsibility,\" according to an aide on the call who requested anonymity to share the private conversation. She also urged the caucus to be \"somber\" and noted that polling on impeachment has changed \"drastically.\"\n\nA one-day NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted last Wednesday found that about half of Americans \u2014 49% \u2014 approve of the House formally starting an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nThere remains a stark partisan divide on the issue, with 88% of Democrats approving and 93% of Republicans disapproving of the inquiry. But the findings suggest some movement in opinions on the issue. Earlier polls conducted throughout Trump's presidency have consistently found a majority saying he should not be impeached and removed from office.\n\nOn the call, Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York urged the caucus to talk about impeachment by repeating the words \"betrayal, abuse of power, national security.\" At the same time, Democrats' campaign arm was mobilizing to support the candidates, according to a person on the call who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the details.\n\nIn contrast, Republicans offered a televised array of strategies to a president who spent the day at his golf club in Virginia and prefers to handle his own communications.\n\nStory continues", "description": "As Democrats and the director of national intelligence worked out key arrangements, Trump's allies erupted in a surge of second-guessing and conspiracy theorizing across the Sunday talk shows, suggesting the White House strategy is unclear against the stiffest challenge to his presidency.
