(Andrew Shurtleff)\n\nVirginia quarterback Bryce Perkins was in his early teens when the 25th-ranked Cavaliers last hosted Florida State. At that time, the Seminoles still were regularly in the national championship hunt while his current school remained an afterthought in the ACC football hierarchy.\n\nPerkins, a redshirt senior, recalled watching plenty of Florida State games from thousands of miles away in Arizona, where he was blossoming into a high school star, because the Seminoles always seemed to be featured on national television.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous history of great football players and a great football program,\u201d Perkins said during Monday\u2019s news conference from John Paul Jones Arena, \u201cand it\u2019s definitely one of the handful of teams when growing up, you\u2019re like, \u2018They\u2019re great.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe fortunes of both programs since have changed dramatically.\n\n[John Feinstein: Mack Brown\u2019s return to coaching was laid out by his wife: Hawaii, the Bahamas or UNC]\n\nThe Cavaliers, picked in the preseason to win the ACC Coastal Division, are seeking to go 3-0 for the first time since 2005 as they continue their ascent in the fourth year of Coach Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s rebuild.\n\nThe Cavaliers are ranked for the second time under Mendenhall.\n\n\u201cWhat it would mean is we\u2019re starting to build a reputation that, yeah, we\u2019re capable and worth considering, especially if you start the season strong,\u201d Mendenhall said of the ranking. \u201cAfter saying all that, it\u2019s really just interference, and we\u2019ll focus on the game.\u201d\n\nFlorida State (1-1), meanwhile, is on a far more troublesome trajectory after surviving Louisiana-Monroe, 45-44, in overtime last week when the Warhawks missed the tying extra point. The Seminoles are 6-8 since Willie Taggart took over as head coach last year following Jimbo Fisher \u2018s move to Texas A&M.\n\nIn Fisher\u2019s final five full seasons at Florida State, his teams lost nine games combined and won the national championship in the 2013 season, going 14-0.\n\n\u201cTeams aren\u2019t afraid of them anymore,\u201d said E.J. Manuel, an analyst for the ACC Network who played quarterback for the Seminoles. \u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019re supposed to be within a field goal of losing to Louisiana-Monroe. That\u2019s alarming, and so they\u2019re facing U-Va., who I think is one of the better teams in the ACC.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s chaotic in Tallahassee right now. I can only imagine what it feels like to be Coach Taggart. I remember losing a game -- we lost to N.C. State my senior year [2012] by a point [17-16], but we still went to the Orange Bowl and 12 wins, all that kind of stuff. To almost lose to ULM, I can\u2019t relate to that.\u201d\n\nAlso puzzling, according to Manuel, is that the Seminoles remain adrift despite having a wealth of talent both in place when Taggart arrived and over the last two years in recruiting.\n\nThe recruiting website Rivals.com ranked Florida State\u2019s Class of 2018 at No. 10 nationally. The previous two classes were fifth and second, although the Seminoles have been in transition at quarterback after Taggart dismissed former starter Deondre Francois in February.\n\nJames Blackman, a redshirt sophomore, has been the starter this year amid unrest among the impatient fan base.\n\n\u201cI think guys believe in me and believe in the plan and for our guys to continue to stay locked into the plan and not letting anything else take them off the plan,\u201d Taggart said Monday during his weekly news conference. \u201cThat\u2019s the key.\u201d\n\nStability at quarterback, on the other hand, in part has the Cavaliers chasing their first ACC Coastal Division title in program history.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s 52-17 win against William & Mary, Perkins became the fastest Virginia player to reach 3,000 passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards in a career, hitting both marks in 15 games. That\u2019s fewer than half of the games of the previous record holder, Shawn Moore.\n\nLast season Perkins was one of two players nationally to post 2,600 passing yards and 900 rushing yards, joining Heisman Trophy winner Kyler Murray of Oklahoma. Perkins also led all Power Five quarterbacks in tackles avoided (46) and was seventh, tied with Murray, in runs of at least 15 yards (13).\n\nThe defense has done its part as well, ranking second in the ACC and 14th in the country in total yards allowed per game (228).\n\n\u201cJust the way that they\u2019re pressuring the quarterback, I think, is what\u2019s going to keep U-Va. in a lot of games,\u201d Manuel said. \u201cTheir offense is already good with Bryce Perkins and Joe Reed, guys like that, but to me, the biggest growth is their D-line and linebackers. Those guys are impacting the game.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nCalifornia lawmakers voted to let NCAA athletes get paid.
