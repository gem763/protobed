Delta rarely speaks about her relationship with Matthew, whom she has been dating since late 2017, and prefers to keep her personal life out of the headlines\n\nThe announcement comes after rumours the foursome had been playing 'hardball' for more pay and even threatened to quit if they weren't handed more cash.\n\n'Channel Nine are keen to have exactly the same coach panel as this year, as they think it is the perfect line-up, especially with Guy being the standout coach with audiences this year,' a source told New Idea.\n\n'Nine wanted to sign them up for next year before this year's series ended. But the feisty coaches are playing hardball.", "description": "She's been dating musician\u00a0Matthew Copley for almost two years.", "authors": ["Tom Place For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/01/19908070-0-image-a-2_1571443516246.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
