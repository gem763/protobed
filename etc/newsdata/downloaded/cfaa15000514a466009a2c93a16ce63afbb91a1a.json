The apparent revelation was enhanced by Giuliani initially denying the charge before conceding it. Asked by Chris Cuomo, \u201cDid you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?\u201d Giuliani replied, \u201cNo, actually, I didn\u2019t,\u201d before going on to explain how he did exactly that, prompting this exchange:\n\nCuomo: \u201cSo you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\u201d Giuliani: \u201cOf course I did.\u201d\n\nBut Rudy, in fact, confessed this months ago. Indeed, the whole plot has been sitting in plain sight, a gigantic scandal that has confounded the media and the opposition in part through its very nakedness.\n\nIn recent days, a seemingly new scandal materialized: reports of an intelligence whistle-blower encountering disturbing conduct by President Trump, and having his complaint quashed in apparent violation of the law. The complaint turns out to be related to the Ukraine scandal, which has been sitting in plain sight. The Wall Street Journal reports that, in a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump repeatedly pressured his counterpart to work with Giuliani on an investigation of Biden. We are learning more details of a story whose broader contours have been clear more months.\n\nWe have known since last spring that Trump, working through Giuliani, is pressuring Ukraine to supply dirt on Joe Biden. The alleged misconduct by Biden concerns his work as vice-president under the Obama administration. The allegation is that Biden supposedly tried to sack a Ukrainian prosecutor who was propbing his son\u2019s business in the country. The allegation against Biden is totally baseless. In fact, as Bloomberg News discovered, the prosecution was finished before Biden took a stance, the prosecutor was widely considered corrupt, his sacking was consistent with the administration\u2019s pro-democracy agenda, and the Obama administration supported the investigation into Hunter Biden anyway.\n\nOf course, the allegations don\u2019t need to have any merit to them. The mere existence of an investigation is enough of a hook for mainstream news to treat the charges as an open question, and for conservative news to treat the guilt as preordained. And so Trump has been pressuring Ukraine to at least investigate Giuliani\u2019s claims.\n\nThe fact that Trump is pressuring Ukraine into this is no secret. Last spring, Giuliani gave the New York Times a series of insanely incriminating quotes, such as, \u201cWe\u2019re not meddling in an election; we\u2019re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about it. Somebody could say it\u2019s improper,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to give [Ukraine] reasons why they shouldn\u2019t stop [the investigation] because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.\u201d Note how the last line, Giuliani even concedes the interests of his client, Trump, differ from the interests of the U.S. government \u2014 while maintaining that he wants Ukraine to help both.\n\nThis agenda was no secret when Trump spoke to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in July. Ukraine\u2019s public summary of a phone call between its president and Trump noted, \u201cDonald Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\u201d\n\nAnd at the beginning of this month, when a reporter asked Vice-President Mike Pence if the administration was holding up aid for Ukraine as leverage to force it to investigate Biden, he did not deny it. Instead, he underscored the threat:\n\nBut as President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption. And, fortunately, President Zelensky was elected decisively on an anti-corruption message. And he and I discussed yesterday that as he\u2019s assembled his cabinet, and as his parliament has convened, that even in the early days, he informed me that there have been more than 250 bills filed for \u2014 that address the issue of public corruption and really restoring integrity to the public process.\n\nI mean, to invest additional taxpayer [money] in Ukraine, the President wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine. And that\u2019s an expectation the American people have and the President has expressed very clearly.\n\nThis is merely the damning evidence on the surface. The whistle-blower case involves some unknown evidence that may or may not add substantially to the already obvious guilt. Reporting so far has established that a member of the intelligence community was alarmed by a promise Trump made to a foreign leader, and that this concerned his pressure campaign on Ukraine. It\u2019s possible Trump added an especially corrupt inducement, beyond the publicly known threat, in his phone call with Zelensky. It\u2019s possible the whistle-blower is simply reporting the same conversation that has already been made public.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible the conservation was with the leader of a different country \u2014 while we know it was about Ukraine, reporters still haven\u2019t confirmed the call was with Ukraine. One could easily imagine, say, Trump asking Vladimir Putin to threaten Ukraine into smearing Biden.\n\nMeanwhile, conservatives have quickly begun repeating Trump\u2019s message on the matter. First, he insists the whistle-blower is \u201chighly partisan.\u201d He does not explain how he learned the identity of this alleged partisan, nor why his complaint was judged to be a \u201cserious or flagrant problem, abuse or violation of the law\u201d by the inspector general that Trump himself appointed. The logic of Trumpland holds that Trump is the party. Ergo, anybody who criticized Trump, however sterling their Republican credentials, is by definition partisan.\n\nAs if to test the devotion of his followers, Trump has proceeded to insist on both the innocuousness of his conversation and the need for its secrecy.\n\n....statement. Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2019\n\nIn sum, (1) if everybody saw what Trump said to the foreign leader, they would agree it was above reproach, and (2) no, you can\u2019t see it.\n\nHis devotees are rewarding their faith. Angelo Codevilla, a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute, dutifully asserts that whatever it was Trump said was \u201cclassified information that neither the press nor the public has seen, will not see, and that concerns an activity that, in itself, is perfectly proper and indeed constitutes the president doing his job.\u201d We don\u2019t know what Trump said \u2014 and, Trump willing, we never shall \u2014 but we know that it was proper and good.\n\nThe extraordinary corruption of Trump\u2019s posture toward Ukraine was already public knowledge. All that remains is to locate the bottom.\n\nThis column has been updated.", "description": "President Donald Trump has been pressuring Ukraine to give him dirt on Joe Biden.
