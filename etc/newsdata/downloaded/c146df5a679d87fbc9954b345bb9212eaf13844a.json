He needed to be physically restrained as he went after umpires Gary Cederstrom and Sam Holbrook. But it took a fan in the stands to remind Martinez that he needed to chill \u2026 for his own wellbeing.\n\n\"I had some fan screaming at me above the dugout when all this was going on, Davey, your heart. Remember your heart.\"\n\nMartinez underwent a cardiac catheterization this year after a heart scare. And his seventh-inning tirade was so animated that a doctor checked on Martinez in the clubhouse just to be safe.\n\n\"I had (a doctor) ask me if I was okay,\" Martinez said. \"I asked him, 'Do I look okay? Yeah'. \"\n\nThankfully, everything seemed to check out fine for Martinez after the ejection.\n\nBut you can't blame the team doctor for playing it on the safe side.
