But that hasn\u2019t stopped the company from pushing forward with its next major smartphone launch.\n\nThe company announced on September 1 that it plans to unveil its new Mate 30 smartphones at an event in Munich, Germany, later this month.\n\nThe Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro will be the follow-ups to the company\u2019s current flagships, the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro. The launch will mark a crucial moment for Huawei as the firm\u2019s first major smartphone launch since the US government placed it on an entity list that prevents it from working with American companies earlier this year.\n\nRead more:Apple may launch a new version of its tiny, cheap iPhone from 3 years ago, and it could be just as crucial for Apple\u2019s business as the iPhone 11\n\nThat means Huawei, which is currently the second-largest smartphone maker in the world, won\u2019t be able to work with American companies like Google without a government license. Google operates the Android smartphone platform, which powers more than 86% of mobile phones around the world.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what we\u2019re expecting to see from the Mate 30 Pro.\n\nThe announcement date is set for September 19.\n\nHuawei will announce its Mate 30 series of smartphones on September 19, the company recently posted on Twitter. It\u2019s unclear when the new devices will actually be released, but last year the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro were available to purchase in some markets on the same day they were unveiled in October. The larger 7.2-inch Mate 20 X launched a few days later.\n\nDid you get it right? The countdown to #HuaweiMate30 starts now!\n\nWe're going full circle in Munich on 19.09.2019.\n\nJoin us live: https://t.co/9ugi5gG9ci#RethinkPossibilities pic.twitter.com/etRYjrBVEC \u2014 Huawei Mobile (@HuaweiMobile) September 1, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether it will have Google\u2019s Android.\n\nsource Reuters Images\n\nConsidering Huawei has not been removed from the US Commerce Department\u2019s Entity List, there\u2019s a possibility the new phone won\u2019t be able to use Google\u2019s Android software or the search giant\u2019s popular collection of apps, like Maps and Gmail.\n\nA Google spokesperson recently told Reuters that the Mate 30 cannot be sold with Google\u2019s software and apps because of the blacklisting. Huawei also said in August that it wasn\u2019t sure whether the Mate 30 would be able to run on Android when asked by Business Insider.\n\nBut Huawei\u2019s Vincent Pang said during a media event at the end of August that the company doesn\u2019t have any current plans to launch a new smartphone powered by its own Harmony OS operating system, per CNET. That suggests it plans to stick with Android for upcoming launches like the Mate 30.\n\nThe phone may have four cameras arranged in a circular cutout.\n\ncaption The Huawei P30. source Shona Ghosh/Business Insider\n\nThe P30 smartphone that Huawei unveiled earlier this year has four rear-mounted cameras, and there\u2019s a good chance the Mate 30 will inherit that quad-camera arrangement, too. Unlike the P30, however, the Mate 30 is expected to include a circular cutout on the back, as shown in leaked images from Pricebaba and prominent gadget leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer.\n\nHuawei\u2019s teaser for its September 19 event further fueled such speculation, since it prominently features a circle that resembles a camera.\n\nIt could also have a 6.6-inch curved display.\n\ncaption The Huawei Mate 20 Pro. source Huawei\n\nThe leaked renderings from Pricebaba and Hemmerstoffer also suggest the phone will have curved edges and a 6.6-inch display. Like the Mate 20 Pro, the Mate 30 Pro will also reportedly have a wide notch near the top of the screen for its front-facing cameras.\n\nIt will likely run on a next-generation Huawei processor.\n\nsource REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nHuawei typically develops its own processors for its smartphones, much like Apple, and the Mate 30 is likely to be no different. Since the P30 and Mate 20 both run on Huawei\u2019s Kirin 980 chip and its Mate 10 predecessor is powered by the company\u2019s older Kirin 970 processor, it\u2019s looking like the Mate 30 will feature a new Kirin 990 chipset. The Mate 30 will also work with 5G networks, according to Reuters.", "description": "Business Insider - Huawei is preparing to release its Mate 30 smartphones this month.
