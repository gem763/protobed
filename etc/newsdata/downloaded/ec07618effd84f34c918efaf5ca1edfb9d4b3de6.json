A senior Revolutionary Guards commander warned the Islamic Republic was ready for \"full-fledged\" war.\n\n\"All American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometres around Iran are within the range of our missiles,\" the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted Commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying.\n\nTensions between Washington and Tehran were already running high because of a long-running dispute between the two nations over Iran's nuclear program that led the United States to impose sweeping sanctions.\n\nOil prices surged as much as 19% in early Asian trade on Monday on worries over global supply and soaring tensions in the Middle East.\n\nBrent crude posted its biggest intra-day percentage gain since the start of the Gulf War in 1991.\n\nState oil giant Saudi Aramco said the attack on Saturday had cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day.\n\nThe U.S. official, who asked not to be named, said on Sunday there were 19 points of impact in the attack on Saudi facilities and evidence showed the launch area was west-northwest of the targets - not south from Yemen.\n\nThe official added that Saudi officials indicated they had seen signs that cruise missiles were used in the attack, which is inconsistent with the Iran-aligned Houthi group\u2019s claim that it conducted the attack with 10 drones.\n\n\"There's no doubt that Iran is responsible for this. No matter how you slice it, there's no escaping it. There's no other candidate,\" the official told reporters.\n\nRiyadh has accused Iran of being behind previous attacks on oil-pumping stations and the Shaybah oil field, charges that Tehran denies, but has not blamed anyone for Saturday's strike. Riyadh also says Tehran arms the Houthis, a charge both deny.\n\nRichard Nephew, a program director at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, said if Iran was responsible for the attack, it may be as retribution for U.S. sanctions.\n\n\"They are making decisions about whether and how to respond to what they see as a massive attack on their interests from the U.S. via sanctions by attacking U.S. interests in turn, and those of U.S. partners they believe are responsible for U.S. policy,\" he said.\n\nAramco gave no timeline for output resumption. A source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take \"weeks, not days\".\n\nRiyadh said it would compensate for the damage at its facilities by drawing on its stocks, which stood at 188 million barrels in June, according to official data.\n\nTrump said he had \"authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCALLS FOR RESTRAINT\n\nConsultancy Rapidan Energy Group said images of the Abqaiq facility after the attack showed about five of its stabilization towers appeared to have been destroyed, and would take months to rebuild - something that could curtail output for a prolonged period.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday the United States was \"locked and loaded\" for a potential response to the attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, after a senior U.S. administration official said Iran was to blame.
