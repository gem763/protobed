Quelle surprise.\n\nThis season\u2019s most seasoned arguer takes umbrage at Mark and Mitch\u2019s builder Jason asking him to spend two hours helping the boys paint, as he agreed six weeks earlier in return for Jason finding him an emergency waterproofer.\n\nRELATED:\n\nEpisode 42: Scott Cam blows his stack at contestant\n\nWhat I learnt on a reality show\n\nJesse claims he\u2019d offered to repay his debt several times but was told not to worry about it. He spent some time caulking Mark and Mitch\u2019s kitchen instead and believes that cleared his ledger.\n\nWhen Jason decides Jesse needs to down his own tools to help the boys paint their veranda Jesse decides instead to down tools to inform the entire population of St Kilda of the outrageousness of the request.\n\nMeanwhile, long-suffering Mel is left to cart several tonnes of soil up the scaffolding while correctly proclaiming \u201cI have the worst boyfriend in the world\u201d.\n\nJesse tries repeatedly to bait Mark on camera, even though Mark and Mitch didn\u2019t even realise Jason was going to make an issue of it.\n\nMel speaks for everyone when she shouts at Jesse \u201cstop carrying on. Talk about it once and then move on. Just do some work\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty rich of Mark to try and claim the high moral ground, though.\n\n\u201cHe seems to like to go on the attack and we don\u2019t like that,\u201d he says serenely, somehow forgetting the multiple times he and Mitch have gone full berserk warrior this season.\n\nAt least Mitch has the good grace to look unconvinced.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s clear the producers have decided they need to help the flagging teams limp to the finish line. Keith arrives at Tess and Luke\u2019s place to announce he\u2019s going to work for them for the day.\n\nThat, and the fact their plastering bill is half of what they\u2019re expecting means they might just finish this house after all.\n\nDan, meanwhile, has rolled up his sleeves for Deb and Andy, and handed them $5000 a certain fast food restaurant\u2019s caffeine division.\n\nIt means all the teams can now take a day off to see their family, who have been flown in from all over Australia by a milk company.\n\nYep, a milk company. How are the producers going to work that piece of product placement into a reno show?\n\nWell, by having Matt Moran teach Scott Cam how to make French toast, obviously.\n\nThis is followed by a challenge featuring the teams shivering on an Artic Melbourne day wearing superhero costumes as they complete an obstacle course that wouldn\u2019t be out of place at Pissweak World.\n\nMatt and El\u2019ise win the $5000 prize. The other teams sacrifice their dignity for nothing.\n\nMISSED AN EPISODE?\n\n\n\nEP 42: Scott Cam blows his stack at contestant\n\n\n\nEP 41 recap: Room brings Shaynna Blaze to tears\n\n\n\nEP 39/40 recap: Tess and Luke finally run out of cash\n\n\n\nEP 38 recap: Mark and Mitch blow their stacks\n\nEP 37 recap: Will Tess and Luke walk out?\n\n\n\nEP 35 and 36 recap: Reason for Tess and Luke\u2019s devastation\n\nEP 34 recap: Mitch puts his foot through the ceiling\n\nEP 32 recap: producer dragged into cheating scandal\n\n\n\nEP 30 recap: \u2018Dog\u2019s breakfast\u2019: kitchen savagely mocked\n\nEP 29 recap: Scott Cam gives contestants a serve\n\nEP 27/28 recap: Gloves are off as teams threaten to quit\n\nEP 26 recap: Tess and Luke flush another tradie\n\nEP 25 recap: Is this the best bathroom on the Block ever?\n\nEP 24 recap: Is this the best Block bathroom ever?\n\nEP 23 recap: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u201d \u2014 Mark and Mitch patch things up with Scott\n\n\n\nEP 22 recap: What made Scott Cam storm off?\n\nEP 21 recap: Homophobia row rocks The Block\n\n\n\nEP 19/ 20 recap: \u2018you just told me my baby is ugly\u2019\n\nEP 18 recap: Tess\u2019 expletive-filled tirade after tradie sacking\n\nEP 17 recap: Loo controversy sinks two teams\n\nEP 15/16 recap: What made Mitch snap?\n\nEP 14 recap: Jesse and Keith\u2019s blow up\n\nEP 13 recap: Judges slam Mark and Mitch\n\nEP 11/12: Big move may blow up friendship\n\nEP 10 recap: Why Scott Cam locked a contestant in car\n\nEP 9 recap: How Jesse insulted Shaynna\n\nEP 7/8: \u2018Don\u2019t be nice to them\u2019.
