(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nWilliam Pesek is a Tokyo-based writer and author of \u201cJapanization: What the World Can Learn from Japan\u2019s Lost Decades.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, President Trump announced that the United States and Japan reached an initial trade deal. But don\u2019t be fooled. As geopolitical bets go, the one that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe placed on Trump might rank among the worst in modern history.\n\nScrutinizing Trump\u2019s bromances is a popular parlor game among foreign policy wags. There\u2019s his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, just to name a few.\n\nYet no bond has persevered as much as Abe\u2019s bond with Trump \u2014 or arguably yielded less.\n\nIt all started with a sprint to New York\u2019s Trump Tower on Nov. 17, 2016, nine days after Trump\u2019s shock win. When Abe visited the United States 50 days prior to the election, he met Hillary Clinton but not Trump. Why waste time meeting a Republican challenger she would surely vanquish?\n\nBut after the election, Abe sprang into action, becoming the first world leader to visit the president-elect. Abe vouched for the \u201cAmerica First\u201d firebrand: \u201cI am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence\u201d and enjoy a \u201crelationship of trust.\u201d\n\nThat testimonial hasn\u2019t aged well. Right out of the gate, Trump reneged on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal that had cost Abe vast amounts of political capital getting his protectionist-minded Liberal Democratic Party onboard. For Team Abe, the 12-nation TPP was vital to curbing China\u2019s surging influence in Tokyo\u2019s backyard.\n\nNow, Trump\u2019s trade war with China is costing Abe his main legacy \u2014 the longest economic expansion since the 1980s \u2014 and the political clout that came with it.\n\nIn August, Japanese exports fell for a ninth straight month, while real wages dropped for a seventh. After taking power in 2012, Abe pledged to end deflation once and for all. Tokyo opened the fiscal and monetary floodgates, driving the yen down by 30 percent. The hope was that an export boom would prod companies to fatten paychecks, kicking off a virtuous cycle. But all is in jeopardy now as economists fear another Japanese recession.\n\nThis in turn jeopardizes Abe\u2019s career-long pursuit to revise the pacifist postwar Constitution so that Tokyo can once again field a conventional, offensive military. Abe\u2019s plan to use the currency afforded by a strong economy to pass that legislation to change \u201cArticle 9\u201d is now falling by the wayside.\n\nSo are Tokyo\u2019s national interests. Trump\u2019s \u201clove\u201d affair with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un has Abe\u2019s fellow nationalists in a whirl. Bad enough that Trump humiliated Tokyo by disclosing \u2014 against protocol \u2014 that Abe reportedly nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize. Worse that Trump looks the other way as Kim tests short-range missiles that could hit Tokyo \u2014 or U.S. troops in Okinawa. This leaves Abe with some explaining to do in nationalist circles.\n\nAnd the bromance didn\u2019t even earn Tokyo a pass on trade. As Trump\u2019s China tariffs are decimating the Asian supply chains on which Japan relies, Trump is browbeating Tokyo for bilateral trade concessions.\n\nThe initial trade agreement reportedly agreed on this week does not solve these concerns. There are few details about the plan, with no mention of the real sticking point: automobiles. Trump, for example, has threatened 25 percent tariffs on cars and auto parts at any time. He is also pressuring Abe to buy billions of dollars in military hardware and prod private companies to buy surplus corn that China won\u2019t. Will these issues be fixed by the pact?\n\n\u201cThe Abe-Trump romance is a one-sided affair,\u201d says Jeff Kingston, head of Asian studies at Temple University\u2019s Tokyo campus. \u201cAbe has done his best to manage his erratic counterpart but has little to show for his brown-nosing.\u201d Yuki Tatsumi of the Stimson Center in Washington calls the relationship a \u201cfriendship without benefits.\u201d And it\u2019s unlikely to get much better.\n\nTrump, for example, wants a weaker dollar, adding to the headwinds zooming Japan\u2019s way. This poses special risks for the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt. As Trump tosses grenades at the Federal Reserve and generates $1 trillion-plus annual deficits, Washington\u2019s top banker in Asia \u2014 with $1.1 trillion of U.S. Treasurys \u2014 has ample reason for concern.\n\nTokyo is also bracing for a Trump shakedown. Trump has long railed against what he views as an exploitative security arrangement. If he\u2019s not sufficiently impressed by Abe\u2019s trade concessions, will he decide to charge Japan more for protection?\n\nBecause Japanese leaders are chosen by party and opposition forces are in disarray, Abe has managed to avoid true public accountability for his huge bet on Trump. In July elections, though, Abe failed to win a supermajority in parliament needed to revise the Constitution.\n\nIn November, Abe will become Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader. But it won\u2019t be much of a celebration, as his economic success vanishes in Trumpian chaos. When Abe is older, grayer and wondering where his legacy went, one thought might sustain him: We\u2019ll always have Trump Tower.\n\nRead more:\n\nYoichi Funabashi: Poor Japan-South Korea relations weaken Trump\u2019s hand with Kim Jong Un\n\nJeff Kingston: Brand Japan is taking a hit\n\nRobert J.
