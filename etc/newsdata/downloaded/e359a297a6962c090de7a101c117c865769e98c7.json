As much a portal as a street, Pozas is narrow, noisy, tight with people, a pace and direction of its own. On either side, every other entrance is a bar, flags hung over doorways; at the end, the football stadium rises in the sunset, drawing you in irresistibly but without hurry as if there\u2019s no way out, nowhere else you could possibly go and nowhere else you would want to go either, especially not today. The Cathedral, they call it. And, as they were pulled towards San Mam\u00e9s on Friday night, through red-and-white shirts, through blue-and-white shirts too, Jon, Onintza, Xabi, Andoni, Maddalen and Amets occasionally stopped and broke into verse. When they did, crowds wearing both colours gathered to listen and laugh.\n\nThe Basque derby means the bertso derbi too, sport as song and song as sport. Competitive, improvised street poetry: witty, incisive and theirs. The six bertsolari, three supporting Athletic Club, three supporting Real Sociedad, had paused to perform where Pozas crosses Mar\u00eda D\u00edaz de Haro street and momentarily opens up, and then again on a stage set in front of the new stadium on old ground. Standing where the original San Mam\u00e9s had stood for 99 years and where its spirit survives, they\u2019d done battle, words flying. Now, just before 10pm, two minutes before kick-off, Jon Maia and Maddalen Arzallus were on the pitch. \u201cIf the world is a football \u2026\u201d Jon began, \u201cour greatest victory is to be ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe Spanish Football Podcast (@tsf_podcast) Outside San Mam\u00e9s, before the football, there's another derby - el Bertso Derbia, which @sidlowe says is \"a kind of improvised competitive Basque street poetry\".\n\n\n\nThose Basques know how to have a good time...#tsfpAtTheGames #AthleticRealSociedad pic.twitter.com/0Rc2F4VXsQ\n\nWhen he lowered the mic, 47,697 people roared. In the tunnel, waiting, Gaizka Garitano could hear it. \u201cThis is not any game,\u201d he said later, and if anyone knows that, he does. Growing up, he wanted to be a bertsolari, but he doubts that he really had the talent for it \u2013 these guys are the Messi and Ronaldo of verse, he says \u2013 and he became a footballer instead. Born in Bilbao, he played in the Basque Country for Athletic, la Real, Eibar and Alav\u00e9s. Of his 16-year playing career, 14 were spent in Euskadi and he built a coaching career there too. He it was who took Eibar into primera for the first time ever and since December he has been manager of Athletic Club. What he has done at both is extraordinary; it is also fitting somehow, faithful to an identity which is his.\n\nThere\u2019s something special about Basque football and about this derby in particular, where the fans sit together and that was perhaps even more evident this week. Sometimes football is an expression of self, and this felt like one of those times \u2013 all the more so in the context of what has happened at Athletic over the nine months since Garitano took over, seeking survival. Like this wasn\u2019t just winning; this was being.\n\nThe Basque Country makes up 1.4% of Spain\u2019s territory, 1.4% of its population and 20% of its top-flight football teams. Include Osasuna (which many do; the club name is Basque) and thus add Navarre (which is another step again in an uneasy debate), and it accounts for 3.6% of the territory, 6.2% of the population and a quarter of all first division teams. Most know about Athletic\u2019s policy, but it\u2019s not just them. In the build-up to this game, Athletic striker I\u00f1aki Williams was asked if he envied la Real\u2019s signings, which include Alexander Isak, Martin Odegaard, and Portu; no, he said, but they envy us having people \u201cfrom home\u201d. Yet until John Aldridge came, unwelcome at the start, celebrated at the end, la Real had a similar approach; 15 of their squad have been in the youth system; and on Friday seven started \u2013 two in the Athletic side. Of the 22 starters, 15 were Basque (17 if you include two from Navarre), 11 had been in in the junior teams at Athletic or Real and both managers were Basque.\n\nUnion Berlin rock German football with the scalp of Dortmund | Andy Brassell Read more\n\nThe game was Basque too, very Athletic. And if there\u2019s an element of clich\u00e9 in that, there\u2019s also a significant element of truth. Garitano heard Jon finish, then sent his team out the way he does \u2013 roaring at their rivals, relentless. As El Diario Vasco put it: \u201cEvery time Real lost the ball, there was an ambush; every corner was a headache; every attempt to bring the ball out, they were suffocated; every challenge, a defeat.\u201d They were behind after 11 minutes: in his 122nd consecutive game, Williams swept in Ander Capa\u2019s ball after a neat one-two from a throw \u2013 Capa\u2019s third assist and the third time Athletic have scored via a throw. It was two on 28, Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda looping a lovely shot beyond Miguel-\u00c1ngel Moy\u00e1, which is how it finished but it could have been more. Yuri Berchiche struck one, I\u00f1igo C\u00f3rdoba another as Athletic steamrollered Real, racking up 15 shots in a din enough to make ears bleed. Unable to live with it, built for a different game, la Real didn\u2019t have their first shot until the 84th minute.\n\nLa Real had prepared for this, manager Imanol Alguacil said. But they could do nothing to stop it and could find no way out. There was escaping Athletic or the truth: his team had a goal ruled out by VAR, which also turned a penalty into a free-kick just outside the box, and their captain Asier Illaramendi was taken off injured, all moments that might have changed this, but Alguacil admitted that Athletic were \u201cbetter in everything\u201d; \u201cthey deserved to win,\u201d he said. His side looked cowed, \u201clike lambs before lions\u201d, Marca called them. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to nullify them the way we nullified them, because they\u2019re a very, very good team,\u201d Garitano said, \u201cbut Athletic imposed themselves \u2013 as we have done in the last few months.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nThat \u201clast few months\u201d was not pulled from thin air. Before the game, Garitano had noted how his team had begun \u201coverwhelming opponents\u201d and they did it again. La Real were \u201cunrecognisable\u201d, one headline had it; Athletic, on the other hand, were \u201ca red and white cyclogenesis\u201d, said El Correo, and exactly the way they always are. Or are supposed to be.\n\nGonzalo Higua\u00edn again the defining figure in Juventus-Napoli rivalry | Nicky Bandini Read more\n\nIf there was a moment that defined this game, that defines them, rather than Williams\u2019s goal or Garc\u00eda celebrating his by signalling the wound on his leg; rather than the cheeky Capa skill that got a huge cheer, Yuri bombing up and down, or Iker Munian buzzing everywhere; rather than the way defenders look over their shoulder, terrified, every time Williams sets off; maybe it was the moment la Real broke. The pitch opened before them, but suddenly, Dani Garc\u00eda, whose mates are all Real fans, closed it again. Stepping out, alone, he won the tackle then stood there, arms wide, defiant, a gladiator in the ring. Are you not entertained?\n\nOh, they were entertained all right, greeting him with a wall of sound. Football is this too, especially here. Afterwards, one Real Sociedad-supporting columnist called Athletic \u201cprimitive\u201d, insisting \u201cthere is no team that obtains more with less\u201d, whinging: \u201cHow boring!\u201d But he was wrong. Ask those fans what they thought. Or the headline that called Athletic \u201ca team to enjoy\u201d. Or Garitano, who described them as \u201calegre\u201d \u2013 happy, open, fun. Better still, ask them what they want. Because, if Garitano also called them intense, a team based \u201cmore on the physical than the technical\u201d, a side that has to \u201csweat every point\u201d, that is also the way they are \u2013 and the way they\u2019re supposed to be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in our DNA, the way we are,\u201d Athletic\u2019s manager insisted. \u201cYou talk to me about style books, but I haven\u2019t read any of them. This is us. It\u2019s contagious. People at San Mam\u00e9s enjoy it; we have to transmit that to them, that effort. We can have a bad game but we always have to do that. The communion with the stands is very important. Historically we have a way of playing, values, and we have to express that every day.\u201d\n\nLaLiga (@LaLigaEN) Highlights as @Athletic_en won the Basque derby to go \ud83d\udd1d of #LaLigaSantander!\n\n\n\n(Raul Garcia's goal at 0:33 \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31)#AthleticRealSociedad pic.twitter.com/Kpl263662E\n\nIt works, too. In 2006, Angel Garitano arrived at Athletic as assistant coach on a rescue mission. They had won only once in 13 games and were in the relegation zone; going down for the first time ever was a genuine possibility. Twelve years later, his son Gaizka arrived at Athletic as coach. They had won just once in 14 games and were in the relegation zone; going down for the first time ever was a genuine possibility. Athletic were 18th but within a month they scored that penalty, from that run, and didn\u2019t lose for seven games. On the final day, they were a crossbar\u2019s width from a European place. They\u2019d climbed 10 places, winning 12 of 24 under Garitano and began this new season beating Barcelona, with Aritz Aduriz\u2019s absurd overhead kick.\n\nOn Friday, they went on top.\n\nTwo days later, Atl\u00e9tico overtook them but Athletic are still second. \u201cThis is something to enjoy,\u201d Williams said on Friday night. Athletic had gone 14 games without defeat at home \u2013 right back to the last time la Real came. Seven months on, they\u2019d beaten them back and had done it their way; they were who they are. \u201cI\u2019m glad the people are happy,\u201d Garitano said. \u201cThis is not any game; it\u2019s special, the most important night of the entire year.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Unai Sim\u00f3n celebrates Athletic\u2019s victory.

Barcelona were bad, but it shouldn\u2019t only be about that; it should be about Osasuna too. They\u2019re still unbeaten at home, after a deserved 2-2 draw with Barcelona, Roberto Torres getting both, the first a lovely sidefooted volley. That\u2019s 27 games now without defeat there. \u201cAt times we bordered on perfection,\u201d said Osasuna coach Jagoba Arrasate.\n\nLaLiga (@LaLigaEN) The highlights from #OsasunaBar\u00e7a including 16-year-old Ansu Fati's fabulous first goal in #LaLigaSantander! \ud83d\udcfa pic.twitter.com/CgbQGzVuOg\n\n\u2022 Old enough to be his dad and all that. Well, this time it\u2019s true. On the same day that Ansu Fati became Barcelona\u2019s youngest goalscorer at 16 years 304 days \u2013 \u201c\u2019I said to myself, bloody hell, I\u2019ve scored\u2019,\u201d he admitted afterwards \u2013 Jorge Molina became Getafe\u2019s oldest goalscorer at 37 years and 131 days. And here\u2019s the even more amazing bit: Molina has scored 51 first division goals, 46 of them after turning 30.\n\n\u2022 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid were 2-0 down, the first time they had ever let in two goals in the opening 20 minutes under Diego Simeone. They changed formation twice, brought on three subs \u2013 two of whom scored and the other was a 19-year-old debutant \u2013 and came back to beat Eibar 3-2, getting the winner in the 90th minute, sending Simeone racing into the arms of Mono Burgos. They\u2019re the only team to have won all three games so far. Kieran Trippier, top.\n\nLaLiga (@LaLigaEN) \u2705 5 goals!\n\n\u2705 @joaofelix70's first in #LaLigaSantander!\n\n\u2705 A 90th-minute winner!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Highlights #AtletiEibar \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/SmcWguFDFa\n\n\u2022 The sooner Gareth Bale leaves the better? He scored two and saw two yellow cards (within seconds of each other in the 90th minute) as Madrid got a 2-2 draw at Villarreal. For the third year in a row. Mostly, they were really not that good. And it\u2019s hard to avoid the feeling they don\u2019t really know what to do about it, that this wasn\u2019t what they planned \u2013 something Bale\u2019s inclusion suggests. Santi Cazorla\u2019s still got it, by the way. But that\u2019s three games in a row Villarreal have led and they haven\u2019t won any.\n\nLaLiga (@LaLigaEN) Gareth Bale struck two equalisers at the Estadio de la Ceramica! \u26bd\u26bd\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa Highlights #VillarrealRealMadrid pic.twitter.com/m5FqLs3FdP\n\n\u2022 \u201cFekir is stratospheric,\u201d Betis manager Rubi said after he led them to their first win of the season, 2-1 against Legan\u00e9s. It was hard to disagree, too.\n\n\u2022 Deadline day, so what is Valencia manager Marcelino asking for? \u201cI think it makes no difference what I ask for,\u201d he said. There may be trouble ahead.\n\n\u2022 Neymar 2020. So we get to do it all over again.
