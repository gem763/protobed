There was a very simple explanation for the mystery of her racing heart. She had been frightening herself.\n\n\u201cI went from being very anxious with a racing heart to understanding that I had really just become frightened of my own symptoms.\n\n\u201cThe simplicity of the argument in the book struck me with such force, I thought who is this brilliant woman, this Dr Claire Weekes.\u201d\n\nIt emerged that Weekes had written her first book, Self Help for Your Nerves, in 1962. She had subsequently written others that all become international bestsellers.\n\nDr Weekes 1962 bestseller.\n\nYet, while her success in treating anxiety helped millions across the world, her pioneering work was never given any official recognition.\n\nThe power of Weekes\u2019 simple explanation of anxiety and her insight into what became known as the mind-body connection, stayed with Hoare through the following three decades as she worked as a senior editor at the Financial Review.\n\nYears of closely following leading figures across business and politics taught her that few individuals really make a powerful, individual contribution to the common good.\n\nThen, about five years ago, Hoare brought her successful newspaper career to a close so she could work on her own project: a biography of Weekes.\n\n\u201cI thought what a fascinating chase it would be to see how this woman landed on what looks like a simple idea but is really quite brilliant, especially when measured by the number of people it has helped,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Hoare came over for lunch. She was just off a plane from London where her book, The Woman who Cracked the Anxiety Code \u2013 the extraordinary life of Dr Claire Weekes (Scribe), has just been published, and well received.\n\nAt the table, Hoare\u2019s enthusiasm for her subject hid her exhaustion. Weekes, she believes, is the invisible hand behind the very latest approaches to treating anxiety.\n\nDr Weekes in 1955 when she was admitted as a Fellow of the College of Physicians.\n\nWeekes\u2019 personal experience of devastating anxiety, followed by a lifetime of attention to the suffering of others has delivered a powerful insight that changed lives across the globe.\n\nSo, what is it?\n\nIt is that \u201cfear of fear\u201d feeds anxiety, she says. It is that much anxiety and/or nervous illness is caused by people becoming frightened of themselves, frightened of the state they are in.\n\n\u201cThat fear starts a vicious feedback loop between the mind and the body. They get stuck in a fear cycle.\n\n\u201cWeekes would explain, \u2018You are in a state because you are frightened of yourself, frightened of the dreadful feeling of fear, frightened of your own symptoms, mental and physical which seem to have consumed you.\u2019\u201d\n\nWeekes was not saying that nervously ill people did not have real problems to begin with.\n\n\u201cThe fear might have started from a genuine problem or maybe, as in my case, from an illness that runs you down,\u201d says Hoare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it was only when people became afraid of the symptoms of fear \u2013 a fear of the fear \u2013 that Weekes would say they were nervously ill.\n\n\u201cUnlike Freud who looked back to childhood experiences, Weekes is saying what is happening right now, is more relevant.\n\n\u201cWhere Freud delved into the unconscious, she focused on the interaction between the mind and the body.\n\nWeekes was treating panic attacks before the term was even coined.\n\n\u201cPeople with a nervous illness often feel it in their body. It\u2019s not just a worry roaming around in their head. Along with those frightening thoughts, the whole body, its organs and systems, get engaged, from the heart, lungs and stomach, to the skin.\u201d\n\nDuring her research for the book, Hoare discovered that Weekes had a similar experience to her own. As a young student, Weekes had become alarmed by a racing heartbeat after a period of ill health.\n\nThis led her to be misdiagnosed with the dreaded TB, or tuberculosis, isolated in a sanatorium for six months and restricted to lying on a couch. It was the perfect Petri dish for a fear that took hold and would not let go.\n\nWhen she was released, she was terrified and overwhelmed. But over the next 18 months, she taught herself how to strip fear of its power.\n\nThat was in the 1930s and by the time she had written her first best-selling book, she had a lifetime of experience in how deranging fear could be to the mind and body.\n\nHer treatment was based on a unique understanding of what she called first and second fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen people perceive a threat, such as a snake or tiger, the body instinctively prepares for fight, flight or freeze. This is first fear and it is primal.\n\nBut when someone run down with illness or worry experiences this while standing in a supermarket queue, that triggers greater alarm or second fear.\n\nTo calm the body, Claire Weekes formulated a simple mantra: face, accept, float, let time pass.\n\nWeekes understood this and was treating panic attacks before the term was even coined, explaining they occurred because people added second fear to first fear.\n\nWeekes ability to describe exactly how people suffered, gave her instant credibility.\n\n\u201cDistressed people, who think they are getting worse than they are, start to worry about their symptoms. They add fear to fear which creates a cycle they feel unable to break,\u201d says Hoare.\n\nSo, how can it be broken?\n\nFor Weekes, the answer lies in yielding to the fear. This is about balancing two biological systems: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems.\n\nThe sympathetic system stimulates the body's fight-flight-freeze response by increasing the heart rate and breathing, constricting vessels and shutting down digestion.\n\nIn contrast, the parasympathetic system calms the body by stimulating it to \"feed and breed\" and \"rest and digest\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe key is to yield. This starts to calm the body.\n\nTo achieve this, Weekes has a simple mantra: face, accept, float, let time pass.\n\nFace means don\u2019t run away, accept means own it, float means don\u2019t fight it, and letting time pass, gives the body the time to get the message.\n\nWhile getting the body back in balance is simple, it is not necessarily easy. Some have to practice but others, like Hoare, experienced immediate success.\n\nAnd should any stress return, this is an opportunity to practice acceptance rather than regard it as a defeat. Once people have learnt how \u2018to pass through panic\u2019, they have way of curing themselves.\n\nDr Weekes had a profound, positive influence on my life and my work in anxiety disorders. \u2014 Professor Robert DuPont\n\nHoare says Weekes' ability to describe exactly how people suffered, gave her instant credibility. That she had suffered herself was palpable and to others, she offered compassion and hope.\n\nWith her books having sold their socks off, Hoare was surprised no one had written about Weekes who had kept helping people until she died in 1990, aged 87.\n\nWhile she was convinced the subject was worthy, Hoare was uncertain how a biography would be received and sent out some tentative enquiries to experts to see if they agreed Weekes was a worthy subject.\n\nWithin 24 hours an email entitled \u201cI am the guy you want for your book\u201d landed in her inbox from Professor Robert DuPont.\n\nDuPont\u2019s pedigree is impressive. He was the first director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the White House drug czar under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and the founder of the Institute for Behaviour and Health and the Anxiety Disorders Association of America.\n\nMost importantly, he wanted to help!\n\n\u201cDr Weekes had a profound, positive influence on my life and my work in anxiety disorders \u2013 and the field itself. But no one but you and I know that, maybe your book can change that,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFor Hoare, the power of this confirmation was beyond anything she could have expected. She said Dupont's support sat like a foundation beneath the book, which will be launched in Australia this week.", "description": "When an Australian doctor cracked the anxiety code, she helped millions of people around the world to settle.
