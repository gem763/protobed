It's a public good. Year by year results have led to an increasingly rigorous focus on data and what it tells us is to lift achievement further.\n\n\"Australian education is multi-sector and multi-jurisdictional. The dynamics cut across different communities. So if we want real progress, we need to look at results with a consistent frame of reference and that's only possible with a framework like NAPLAN.\n\n\"People forget it's only by having a shared national attainment across different circumstances [that] it's possible to have an evidence-based discussion about funding and resources.\"\n\nMr Bentley was a policy adviser with the UK Labour government of prime-minister Tony Blair working on curriculum, jobs and economic development before coming to Australia in the early 2000s.\n\nHe credits other people for NAPLAN including former Liberal education minister Julie Bishop, who persuaded the states to sign up to a system of national testing in literacy and numeracy at ages 3, 5, 7 and 9 before the federal election in November 2007. The election delivered a new education minister: Julia Gillard.\n\nMs Gillard decided to launch NAPLAN and Mr Bentley was hired to integrate testing into the curriculum.\n\n\"Australia was in a situation where there was no transparent reporting of student performance because of fragmentation at state, federal and multi-sector levels. Diffusion and obscurity were the norm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"And there was no way students' attainment could be measured against their demographic circumstances.\"\n\nPolicy makers knew there was a problem. Ever since Australia joined the OECD's Program for International Student Assessment in 2000, literacy and numeracy levels had been falling. Experts called it \"PISA shock\".\n\n'Fair bit of pushback'\n\n\"Julia Gillard was the champion, I was her point person,\" Mr Bentley said.\n\n\"There was a fair bit of push back. There was uncertainty among some school principals. And education unions resisted.\"\n\nHe said critics think the test is too narrow in focus, not frequent enough to be useful and too stressful for students.\n\n\"The stress issue is overdone. It's true if kids fail it can stress them. But learning to take tests and focus on assessment to the best of your ability is one skill you need in life.\n\n\"I'm doing a country study of South Korea at the moment, looking at assessment structure, college-entrance exams and so on. A high number of South Korean kids are studying for 60 hours a week. Many are prepping past midnight. We don't have that level of pressure on students.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It is possible to run a test without causing stress and anxiety.\"\n\nNAPLAN is run annually but only in years 3, 5, 7 and 9. Tests are done in May and results are available in August, which has given ammunition to critics who say the test is not frequent enough to be meaningful.\n\nBut Mr Bentley said the shift to online testing, which has got a lot of push back, means it will be possible to get results more quickly and do more to adjust teaching in the light of them. And this complements the professional judgement of teachers.\n\n\"That's the direction NAPLAN is going in and it is the direction Julia Gillard wanted it to go in 2011\"\n\nOne of his strongest criticism is from parents and teachers who say NAPLAN forces schools to \"teach to the test\".\n\n\"If Australian students were only being taught to the test and large amounts of the curriculum were being abandoned, it would be obvious.\n\n\"NAPLAN results have not gone up much. Only in some jurisdictions. The idea that teaching is being prioritised at any cost is not borne out by the data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's about mastery of some core part. NAPLAN is not that far from the competence we want students to have.\"\n\nMr Bentley said NAPLAN \"tests the curriculum\" which was Ms Gillard's plan.\n\nIn 2008, the then education minister created the forerunner to the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA). Transparent testing was incorporated into the curriculum and funding for the states was made conditional on signing up to the curriculum, as part of a National Partnership Agreement.\n\n\"If a teacher has done exceptionally well we look at their strategies and spread them around.\" Derek Scott, principal of Haileybury school, Melbourne. Arsineh Houspain\n\n\"Curriculum development was very important and it still is. National curriculum and national development come together. In 2009 for the first time, Australia had an evidence-based framework.\n\n\"It's important for citizens to be able to look up and understand accurate information on their school and other schools in comparable circumstances.\"\n\nMr Bentley said this is supported by an independent survey commissioned by ACARA this year, which showed nearly 60 per cent of parents thought NAPLAN was either quite, very or extremely valuable.\n\nAmong them, 62 per cent said they liked NAPLAN because it gave them a snapshot about their child's progress and 58 per cent liked it because it allowed comparison to other students in the state or country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ACARA survey showed as online testing spread after 2016 parents had few concerns about it. Despite this one of the recent reviews of NAPLAN commissioned by state education ministers was focused solely on online testing.\n\nAs for claims that parents use NAPLAN results to \"shop for schools\", the ACARA survey showed in 2018 two-thirds of parents did not even look at the My School website.\n\n'Powerful tool'\n\nDerek Scott, principal of Melbourne private school Haileybury, said he has never had a complaint from a parent about NAPLAN.\n\nThe ability to slice the data and match similar and different groups gives the school a \"powerful tool\".\n\n\"Parents look at individual results but the school uses it collectively,\" Mr Scott said.\n\n\"We break the data down by campus and class. If a teacher has done exceptionally well, we look at their strategies and spread them around.\n\n\"Australia now has a system of standardised testing that is deep and rich in data, which we should use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I come back to the notion of accountability and transparency, which is missing in large sections of the education system. Many educators don't want that but we must push back to lift results for our students.\"\n\nAt the other end of the educational spectrum is David Wantsall, principal of Ballajura Primary School in the northern suburbs of Perth. He said his staff go through NAPLAN results question by question for each of 750 students.\n\n\"It isn't the be-all and end-all. There are some things it can't measure like social and emotional performance.\n\n\"But it helps us to improve, and our performance has been strong. There's no push back from teachers. Staff see results as a validation, they know they are doing the right thing.\n\n\"Parents are pleased. Working-class parents do want to see their kids doing the three Rs. They want 21st century skills like creativity but they understand literacy and numeracy are good.\"\n\nThe claim by NAPLAN critics that schools ignore creativity and emotional development in favour of teaching to the test is rejected by principals.\n\nMr Wanstall said his staff \"prepare for NAPLAN, but we don't teach to the test\".\n\n\"Children need to have a good grasp of reading and writing. I believe testing is important for kids. It's something they will experience in other parts of life no matter what school or profession they enter.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaileybury's Mr Scott said it is not possible to literally teach the test, especially now that NAPLAN online creates a different test for each student. \"But if teachers were teaching to the test it wouldn't be a bad thing,\n\n\"The focus is literacy and numeracy.\"\n\nMr Bentley said too many critics in the state governments forget that it's only measuring national attainment across different circumstances that it's possible to have an evidence-based discussion about funding and resources.\n\n\"Over time, I see systems and groups of schools are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their use of data sets. There's a more sophisticated approach to student assessment and remediation.\"\n\n\"NAPLAN and My School are public data resources. It's understandable [that the] states want to frame and review testing in their own way. But secession is a mistake. Be careful what you wish for.\"", "description": "The man who created NAPLAN said the benefits of a national testing system outweighed concerns of self-interested state critics.
