The offer challenges a $15-billion all-stock bid from Takeaway.com, with which Just Eat finalized merger plans in August. Some Just Eat shareholders are pushing Prosus to pitch a higher offer to outbid Takeaway.com. (Financial Times)\n\nTalking point: Prosus\u2014which made three previous attempts to acquire Just Eat\u2014will have to convince the company\u2019s board that the cash it\u2019s offering now is more valuable than the prospect of joining forces with Takeaway. The interest in Just Eat underscores the opportunity giant tech firms see in the online food-delivery space. Prosus, an early Tencent investor, has stakes in Berlin-based Delivery Hero, India\u2019s Swiggy and iFood in Brazil. Whether Just Eat decides to partner with Prosus or Takeaway, the move could help it rival competitors like SoftBank-backed Uber Eats and DoorDash and Amazon-backed Deliveroo.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
