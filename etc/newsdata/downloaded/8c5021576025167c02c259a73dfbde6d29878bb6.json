However, I would like to reiterate that the Holy Father never said what Scalfari wrote that he said.\n\n'Therefore, both the quoted remarks, and the free reconstruction and interpretation by Dr Scalfari of the colloquies \u2014 which go back to more than two years ago \u2014 cannot be considered a faithful account of what was said by the Pope.\n\n'And that will be found rather throughout the Church's magisterium and Pope Francis's own, on Jesus: true God and true man.'\n\nScalfari previously claimed Pope Francis had denied the existence of hell - which the Vatican was again forced to deny. He later admitted some of the quotes which translated this claim were 'not shared by Pope Francis'.", "description": "In a statement given on Wednesday, a Vatican spokesperson insisted comments published in La Repubblica by Italian journalist Eugenio Scalfari were not a 'faithful account of what was actually said'.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19544826-0-image-a-64_1570720171524.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
