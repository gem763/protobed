Upon said discovery, Cain will no doubt seek revenge \u2014 and someone could possibly lose their life amid the chaos. Could Pete Barton (Anthony Quinlan) perhaps be the unfortunate villager on the receiving end of Cain\u2019s anger?\n\nPete recently learned about Moira and Nate\u2019s dalliance when, after spotting that his boss had left her phone behind, he stumbled upon a text conversation between her and Nate, and thus put two and two together. It\u2019s currently unknown whether or not he\u2019ll keep this information to himself, but \u2014 should he agree to do so \u2014 it\u2019s safe to assume that he\u2019ll be in Cain\u2019s bad books when the truth comes out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs per usual, October is set to be a huge month for Emmerdale, with producers having already confirmed that Moira\u2019s affair with Nate will come to light in an explosive way. Given Cain\u2019s penchant for destruction, there\u2019s absolutely no possible scenario in which the lovers won\u2019t be punished for their actions, but Pete\u2019s knowledge of the affair could well put him in Cain\u2019s firing line.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen first-hand what Cain\u2019s capable of when he\u2019s angry, and he\u2019s not exactly renowned for being able to keep his cool. Perhaps he\u2019ll fly off the handle, and Pete will end up losing his life as a result? It\u2019s certainly a possibility. Cain\u2019s attack on Joe Tate (Ned Porteous) comes to mind. Before he\u2019d even given the young lad a chance to explain his actions, the anger got the better of Cain and he let loose \u2014 something which he soon lived to regret.\n\nUpon realising that Joe was, in fact, alive, he resolved to not use his fists again \u2014 and think before taking action in the future. However, given that emotions will no doubt be running high when the affair comes to light, it\u2019s likely that this philosophy will no longer apply.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Cain considers Pete to be a friend. While Nate\u2019s actions will be a big enough betrayal \u2014 especially when you consider the pair had been getting along rather nicely as of late \u2014 it\u2019s Pete\u2019s actions that will undoubtedly hurt more, given that they\u2019ve worked together \u2014 and more or less lived together \u2014 for several years.\n\nIn addition to the fact that the affair is set to out \u2014 coupled with the fact that Pete is aware of said affair \u2014 let\u2019s not forget that actor Anthony is set to depart from the soap, so \u2014 from a narrative point of view \u2014 Pete\u2019s death would actually serve multiple purposes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Cain's anger will no doubt get the better of him when Moira's affair with Nate comes out \u2014 but could Pete get caught in the crossfire?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/03_10_coro_pete_moira_nate_2nd_ep_01-5481_1570308936.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
