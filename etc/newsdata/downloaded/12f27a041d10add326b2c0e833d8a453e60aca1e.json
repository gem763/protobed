For some reason, however, he seems to have difficulty sticking to the blas\u00e9 tone when it comes to a 16-year-old climate activist from Sweden.\n\nLomborg has repeatedly mocked and criticized Greta Thunberg, the prominent young activist who has been sailing across the Atlantic to attend the UN\u2019s Youth Climate Summit and other meetings in the U.S. In June, he tweeted out a cartoon that implied Greta was only useful to climate activists because being young made her unassailable\u2014in four years, it joked, she\u2019d be replaced with someone younger still. Earlier in the year, he\u2019d asked why the World Economic Forum was listening to her at all, and approvingly shared a Quillette article which called Thunberg a fanatic and \u201cabsolutist\u201d and which argued adults had a duty to correct her childlike naivet\u00e9.\n\nAnd Lomborg\u2019s on the more civil end of Thunberg\u2019s critics. In April, while tweeting that her policies were \u201cunrealistic\u201d and \u201ccostly,\u201d he added that, \u201cof course, she should be treated respectfully, just like all participants in the climate debate.\u201d Several of his followers didn\u2019t seem to care for the caveat, attacking Thunberg with comments about her age and mental health in replies.\n\nAs Thunberg approached America, she was followed by a tsunami of male rage. On her first day of sailing, a multi-millionaire Brexit activist tweeted that he wished a freak accident would destroy her boat. A conservative Australian columnist called her a \u201cdeeply disturbed messiah of the global warming movement,\u201d while the British far-right activist David Vance attacked the \u201csheer petulance of this arrogant child.\u201d", "description": "Why do right-wing men hate Greta Thunberg and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez so much?
