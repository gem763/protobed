Photo: Courtesy of the vendor\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Ulta is one of my favorite places on planet Earth. Their mix of high end and drugstore products \u2014 from NYX to Anastasia Beverly Hills \u2014 and near-constant sales make it the best place for worthwhile, budget-friendly beauty purchases.\n\nIf you too love Ulta, good news: Their 21 Days of Beauty Sale has arrived. In case you\u2019re unfamiliar with this particular event, let me explain: Every day from now until September 21, Ulta will release a handful of best-selling, cult-favorite products at insanely discounted prices. One way to shop this event is to visit the Ulta site daily to check which cult-favorite products are on sale. Another, easier way would be to read and then save this article. Because, as a service to you, my loyal readers, I\u2019ve picked the best thing(s) to buy on every day (well, almost every day \u2014 on some days, none of the available items piqued my interest) of the rest of the sale. If anything speaks to you, I recommend setting a reminder in your phone to buy it \u2014 if you want to get Kylie Cosmetics Matte & Velvet Lip Kits for $14 instead of the usual $24, for instance, set an alert to do so on Saturday, September 14. Or if you\u2019d like to procure Urban Decay\u2019s 24/7 Glide On Eye Pencils for $11 instead of $22, set that alert for Saturday the 21. Now go ahead and enjoy the rest of my beauty sale Advent calendar.\n\nTuesday, September 3\n\nRipe Flesh Glisten Drops $14 (was $28, now 50% off) If you\u2019re in the market for a sheeny, pearlescent liquid highlighter, I highly recommend this from Flesh. You can mix it in with your foundation to brighten up your whole face, or dab it along the high points of your face (cheekbones, brow bone, tip of the nose and upper lip) for a highly flattering glow. $14 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nWednesday, September 4\n\nSkyn Iceland Hydro Cool Firming Eye Gels $12 (was $32, now 63% off) I\u2019ve talked about these eye patches several times over the years. They\u2019re great for de-puffing dark, sleepless under eyes, and are particularly adhesive, which means you can wear them as you go about your day (cooking dinner, folding laundry), without worrying that they\u2019re going to slide off your face. Plus, their cooling effect means they feel amazing if you happen to have a hangover. $12 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nSaturday, September 7\n\nAnastasia Beverly Hills Brow Definer $12 (was $23, now 48% off) This pencil is a cult favorite for a reason (Kim Kardashian and Michelle Obama are fans!). It\u2019s super-emollient and waxy, and creates the most natural, hairlike lines. I rarely fill in my brows, but on nights when I want my brows to look more dramatic, it\u2019s always with this pencil. No other brow definer (including the also widely beloved Benefit\u2019s Precisely My Brow) stays put for as long, or looks as realistic on. $12 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nMonday, September 9\n\nPeach & Lily Glass Skin Refining Serum $20 (was $39, now 49% off) This serum is a holy grail for quite a few of my beauty-obsessed pals, and I understand why. It has niacinamide for brightening any uneven skin or dark spots, hyaluronic acid for deeply hydrating the skin, and peptides for promoting collagen production. It\u2019s a wonderful, do-it-all serum that\u2019s definitely worth snagging during this sale. $20 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nSaturday, September 14\n\nKylie Cosmetics by Kylie Jenner Lip Kit $14 (was $27, now 48% off) If you\u2019ve never tried a Kylie Lip Kit before, here\u2019s your chance! I love how silky and creamy this lip liner is \u2014 it goes on really easily, and creates a perfectly soft, straight line. And the lipstick really does stay put all day. $14 at Kylie Cosmetics Buy\n\nMonday, September 16\n\nIt Cosmetics Brushes For Ulta Velvet Luxe Empress Fan Brush #324 $24 (was $48, now 50% off) It Cosmetic\u2019s velvet brushes are some of the best I\u2019ve ever used. They\u2019re soft, fluffy, and my makeup looks flawless and airbrushed. If you\u2019re in the market for new brushes, do yourself a favor and go for this deal. $24 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nFriday, September 20\n\nIt Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye $13 (was $24, now 46% off) If you struggle with dark circles like I do, this concealer might just be your saving grace. It\u2019s super-full coverage \u2014 a little goes a long way \u2014 and it will cancel out any darkness immediately. $13 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nIt Cosmetics Brushes For Ulta Airbrush Blurring Concealer Brush #103 $8 (was $16, now 50% off) If you like spot concealing dark spots rather than applying a full face of foundation everyday, this concealer brush from It Cosmetics will be your new best friend. I\u2019ve already raved about how much I love their fluffy velvet brushes (above), but this one are the perfect size and texture to feather out concealer so that your blemishes are covered in the most natural, seamless-looking way possible. $8 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nSaturday, September 21\n\nUrban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencil $11 (was $22, now 50% off) If you love an accent liner, these creamy, shimmery kohl liners from Urban Decay are some of the best in the biz. They\u2019re super-easy to use, even if you\u2019re a liner rookie, and come in really fun metallic colors. In particular, I love the shade Cuff, a shiny silver, for getting that chic, futuristic effect. $11 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
