The former Weather Channel CEO joined the company as president and CEO back in May, and when I spoke to him last month, he insisted that he\u2019s excited and optimistic about the company\u2019s prospects.\n\nIn fact, he said the DVR business \u201cis not really TiVo\u201d anymore. And the proliferation of streaming services is exactly what\u2019s creating a big new opportunity for the company, one where it can help consumers navigate the seemingly overwhelming streaming landscape.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s embrace the chaos,\u201d Shull told me. \u201cThe more streaming, the better.\u201d\n\nIn the interview below \u2014 which has been edited and condensed for clarity \u2014 we discuss why he took on the job, how he plans to split TiVo into two companies and his plans for TiVo+, the company\u2019s ad-supported streaming service (which launched earlier this week.)\n\nTechCrunch: It seems like part of the goal with you coming on as CEO is this idea of reinventing the company for the world of streaming.\n\nDave Shull: We fully embrace the streaming wars at TiVo, is what I would say.\n\nA little bit of context. I\u2019ve known the company for years, because I\u2019ve been familiar with some of the technology pieces that they had in the IP portfolio. But before I took the job, I talked to CTOs at some of the major operators around the world and said, \u201cTiVo, right? I mean this is a company I\u2019ve heard of, but are they still around?\u201d And the answer consistently was, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s actually the best technology out there.\u201d\n\nSo I started talking to the board and eventually I get the job offer. I walk into a Best Buy and I pick up a Roku box and a TiVo box. I install the Roku box. It\u2019s a brilliant installation process, absolutely brilliant. But then what it gives you is a bunch of different tiles for each of the apps. And so you have to figure out, okay, was that show on Netflix or Hulu?\n\nThe TiVo experience was a little bit \u2014 it needed some more work, is the polite way to say it. But once I had it installed, it\u2019s taken my live TV and my on-demand Prime, Netflix, Hulu and some digital content and pulled it all together. That\u2019s pretty cool because it\u2019s allowing me to find the entertainment that I want to watch tonight, right?\n\nAnd so we\u2019re betting on this chaos of applications that are out there with the streaming wars, saying people are having fatigue from subscriptions and they are desperate to find an amazing way to go back to enjoying watching their TV again. They want someone who can bring all this entertainment together \u2014 on-demand, live, digital \u2014 and make it fun to find, to watch TV again. So that\u2019s our mission. Very simple.\n\nI came in three months ago. The first mandate is, we\u2019ve decided to split the company. So about half of the company is an IP portfolio, 5,000 patents. Then we have the TiVo product base \u2014 and everyone thinks of TiVo as this DVR that you buy at Best Buy. That\u2019s really not TiVo, that\u2019s a tiny fraction of our customers. We have 22 million households around the world that use TiVo to provide exactly what I just said, which is this amazing ability to find entertainment.", "description": "Does TiVo has a future beyond the DVR?
