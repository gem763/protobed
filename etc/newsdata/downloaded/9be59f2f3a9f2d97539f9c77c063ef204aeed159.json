However, it did not complete the actions relevant to its own operation of coaches with droplight windows (enhanced signage and staff briefings) before this accident.\n\n\"So, at the time of the accident, it was effectively operating on the basis of its pre-2017 understanding of the risks, which did not include the risk to people from leaning out of the windows of a moving train.\"\n\nBetween April 2014 and January 2019 GWR recorded 16 occurrences of passengers or staff injured leaning out of a droplight window.\n\nIn 11 of the cases foliage was attributed in the incident.\n\nThe RAIB said: \"Had GWR specifically identified the hazard of passengers leaning out of opening windows and included it in its risk management process prior to the fatal accident at Balham, it is possible that it would have implemented additional mitigation measures which might have prevented the passenger leaning out of the window on 1 December 2018.\"\n\nThe report said Network Rail had not carried out a tree inspection in the area since 2009.\n\nIt said: \"Given that the tree had been visibly (to an expert) in poor health for around five years prior to the accident, it is possible that had a tree inspection been carried out and the incident tree considered for a specialist tree inspection in the five years prior to the accident it might have been identified as needing felling or pruning.\"\n\n(Image: Adrian Roper)\n\nInvestigators found the lack of inspection was \"possibly causal\" to the incident.\n\nBefore Ms Roper's death, GWR had started replacing some trains with newer versions.\n\nSince Ms Roper's death, the report said GWR has improved signs near droplight windows, briefed staff, and train managers now make announcements about the danger of leaning out of open windows.\n\nGWR said that from the end of December it will no longer operate the type of train Ms Roper was on.\n\nA spokesman said: \"Bethan Roper\u2019s death in December last year was tragic incident, and our thoughts remain with her family and friends.\n\n\u201cThere are some clear lessons for the wider railway industry, including GWR, to learn.\n\n(Image: Adrian Roper)\n\n\"At the time of the incident we were in the process of phasing out trains using droplight windows from our fleets, replacing them with modern, safer Intercity Express Trains with sealed windows.\n\n\u201cWe have since introduced a number of measures to minimise the risks while those High Speed Trains were phased out, including enhanced door signage, strengthening announcements about the dangers of leaning out of windows, and re-briefing staff to continue to challenge unsafe behaviour.\n\n\u201cFrom the end of December we will no longer operate this type of train and are working to introduce automatic locks on windows on our Sleeper Service.\u201d\n\nMs Roper's father Adrian has previously spoken about her passion for fighting injustice and how he and her family and friends plan to continue her legacy.\n\n(Image: Adrian Roper)\n\nMr Roper said: \u201cMyself and the family could not be more proud of her. She followed the causes of her heart and lived the fullest and truest of lives, never wasting a second.\n\n\"I sometimes feel it's like something deep down within her knew that her time might be limited so that she absolutely made sure that she lived life to the full and didn't waste a single talent or second.\"\n\nTwo charities have since been created to continue Ms Roper's work after family and friends were left \"with a big hole to fill\" following her death.\n\nThe Bethan Roper Trust will aim to continue her work helping refugees and asylum seekers, and 'Let Sharks B ' will continue her work on shark conservation.\n\nThe British Transport Police and the Office of Rail and Road will also be contributing to an inquest into her death that opened last year. It was adjourned for reports to be compiled.", "description": "Great Western Railway has been criticised over the death of Bethan Roper from Penarth, Wales, who died after sticking her head out of the window of a moving train", "authors": ["Thomas Deacon", "Jonathan Coles", "Image", "Adrian Roper", "Wales News Service", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20607366.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_rbp_mai010219roper800JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
