That donation appears to line up with a $11,000 contribution mentioned in the indictment for an unidentified \u201cCommittee 3.\u201d An \u201cIgor Furman,\u201d meanwhile, made a $100,000 donation to the same committee just weeks earlier. The indictment alleges that \u201cFurman\u201d is in fact Igor Fruman, who intentionally misspelled his name to cover his tracks. The Parnas donations, the indictment alleges, were pass-through donations from Fruman as well, who\u2019d already given the legal maximum to the committee with his first donation.\n\nThat joint fundraising committee also doled out large sums to state Republican parties as well as a number of current and former House Republicans.\n\nThe donations from Parnas and Fruman were part of a spending spree on candidates from the pair, neither of whom had donated much to candidates before 2016, that investigators say was aimed at buying influence.\n\nA McCarthy spokesman told VICE News that he would donate the money to charity, but he didn\u2019t say whether he\u2019d ever met either man. The NRCC will also donate the contributions it received, a spokesman said.\n\n\u201cThese contributions were made ahead of events sponsored by Protect the House, a joint fundraising committee that McCarthy helped form last cycle. The deception documented in today's indictment has no place in our country and as a result, McCarthy plans to donate amounts received to a local charity,\u201d McCarthy spokesman Matt Sparks said in a statement.\n\nThose donations create some bad optics for McCarthy and his House GOP colleagues, who are leading the fight against the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nMcCarthy has offered a series of stumbling defenses of Trump, in one interview denying that Trump had asked China to investigate Biden (he did, publicly on the White House lawn) and in another interview trying to correct a reporter\u2019s verbatim quote of the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nThe NRCC kept sending out press releases attacking House Democrats who\u2019ve supported impeachment on Thursday, even after the news of the arrests broke.\n\n\n\nRead: Here's Why Trump Should Be Freaked Out by the Arrest of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Associates\n\nGood-government groups had begun raising the alarm about the donations, saying that while they might not be illegal, they reflect poorly on the lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely troubling,\u201d said Beth Rotman of Common Cause, a group that filed complaints Federal Election Commission and Department of Justice complaints about the Parnas and Fruman donations. \u201cThe money should absolutely be returned. It shows a really problematic appearance of a conflict [of interest].\u201d\n\nDemocrats were quick to highlight those contributions after the Parnas and Fruman arrest.\n\n\u201cIf the GOP Minority Leader and his campaign committee are willing to pocket money from a man who was just arrested for funneling Russian campaign donors into American elections, then it is clear there [is] no line they will not cross,\u201d Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Cole Leiter said in a statement. \u201cThis is a question of un-American activity: Either you stand for the sanctity of our elections and defending our Constitution, or you do not. Today, Minority Leader McCarthy and his campaign arm need to make a choice.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.), a one-time NRCC chairman, said that McCarthy and the NRCC likely wouldn't know the men who donated. But he advised them to return the money anyway.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople are taking contributions from bad figures all the time, and when they find out they give it back. That\u2019s how you rectify it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t return the money they\u2019ll be open to criticism. That\u2019s generally the way these things are handled.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more concerning evidence regarding one former top Republican, however.\n\nParnas and Fruman met with then-House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions (R-Texas) in 2018. He soon after sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo demanding that he fire the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, a top goal of theirs and Giuliani\u2019s.\n\nThe pair then gave maximum contributions to Sessions \u2014 and used a limited liability corporation to give more than $300,000 to a super PAC that spent millions helping Sessions in his reelection campaign.\n\nSessions, a former NRCC chairman who at the time was one of the most powerful members of House GOP leadership, ended up losing his reelection fight last year. He\u2019s now trying to make a comeback in another House district that\u2019s more solidly Republican. But \u201ccongressman-1,\u201d as the indictment refers to him, may now face a much tougher political challenge \u2014 if not major legal problems.\n\nCover: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, republican of California, speaks during his weekly news conference in Washington, DC on September 26, 2019.
