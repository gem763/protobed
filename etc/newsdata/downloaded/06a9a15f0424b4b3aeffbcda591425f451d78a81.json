The study found that the US military itself might also collapse. This could all happen over the next two decades, the report notes.\n\nThe senior US government officials who wrote the report are from several key agencies including the Army, Defense Intelligence Agency, and NASA. The study called on the Pentagon to urgently prepare for the possibility that domestic power, water, and food systems might collapse due to the impacts of climate change as we near mid-century.\n\nThe report was commissioned by General Mark Milley, Trump's new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, making him the highest-ranking military officer in the country (the report also puts him at odds with Trump, who does not take climate change seriously.)\n\nThe report, titled Implications of Climate Change for the U.S. Army, was launched by the U.S. Army War College in partnership with NASA in May at the Wilson Center in Washington DC. The report was commissioned by Gen. Milley during his previous role as the Army\u2019s Chief of Staff. It was made publicly available in August via the Center for Climate and Security, but didn't get a lot of attention at the time.\n\nThe two most prominent scenarios in the report focus on the risk of a collapse of the power grid within \u201cthe next 20 years,\u201d and the danger of disease epidemics. Both could be triggered by climate change in the near-term, it notes.\n\n\u201cIncreased energy requirements\u201d triggered by new weather patterns like extended periods of heat, drought, and cold could eventually overwhelm \u201can already fragile system.\u201d\n\nThe report also warns that the US military should prepare for new foreign interventions in Syria-style conflicts, triggered due to climate-related impacts. Bangladesh in particular is highlighted as the most vulnerable country to climate collapse in the world.\n\n\u201cThe permanent displacement of a large portion of the population of Bangladesh would be a regional catastrophe with the potential to increase global instability,\u201d the report warns. \u201cThis is a potential result of climate change complications in just one country. Globally, over 600 million people live at sea level.\u201d\n\nSea level rise, which could go higher than 2 meters by 2100 according to one recent study, \u201cwill displace tens (if not hundreds) of millions of people, creating massive, enduring instability,\u201d the report adds.\n\nThe US should therefore be ready to act not only in Bangladesh, but in many other regions, like the rapidly melting Arctic\u2014where the report recommends the US military should take advantage of its hydrocarbon resources and new transit routes to repel Russian encroachment.\n\nBut without urgent reforms, the report warns that the US military itself could end up effectively collapsing as it tries to respond to climate collapse. It could lose capacity to contain threats in the US and could wilt into \u201cmission failure\u201d abroad due to inadequate water supplies.\n\nTotal collapse of the power grid\n\nThe report paints a frightening portrait of a country falling apart over the next 20 years due to the impacts of climate change on \u201cnatural systems such as oceans, lakes, rivers, ground water, reefs, and forests.\u201d\n\nCurrent infrastructure in the US, the report says, is woefully underprepared: \u201cMost of the critical infrastructures identified by the Department of Homeland Security are not built to withstand these altered conditions.\u201d\n\nSome 80 percent of US agricultural exports and 78 percent of imports are water-borne. This means that episodes of flooding due to climate change could leave lasting damage to shipping infrastructure, posing \u201ca major threat to US lives and communities, the US economy and global food security,\u201d the report notes.\n\nAt particular risk is the US national power grid, which could shut down due to \u201cthe stressors of a changing climate,\u201d especially changing rainfall levels:\n\n\u201cThe power grid that serves the United States is aging and continues to operate without a coordinated and significant infrastructure investment. Vulnerabilities exist to electricity-generating power plants, electric transmission infrastructure and distribution system components,\u201d it states.\n\nAs a result, the \u201cincreased energy requirements\u201d triggered by new weather patterns like extended periods of heat, drought, and cold could eventually overwhelm \u201can already fragile system.\u201d\n\nA diagram from the report.\n\nThe report\u2019s grim prediction has already started playing out, with utility PG&E cutting power to more than a million people across California to avoid power lines sparking another catastrophic wildfire. While climate change is intensifying the dry season and increasing fire risks, PG&E has come under fire for failing to fix the state\u2019s ailing power grid.\n\nThe US Army report shows that California\u2019s power outage could be a taste of things to come, laying out a truly dystopian scenario of what would happen if the national power grid was brought down by climate change. One particularly harrowing paragraph lists off the consequences bluntly:\n\n\u201cIf the power grid infrastructure were to collapse, the United States would experience significant:\n\nLoss of perishable foods and medications\n\nLoss of water and wastewater distribution systems\n\nLoss of heating/air conditioning and electrical lighting systems\n\nLoss of computer, telephone, and communications systems (including airline flights, satellite networks and GPS services)\n\nLoss of public transportation systems\n\nLoss of fuel distribution systems and fuel pipelines\n\nLoss of all electrical systems that do not have back-up power\u201d\n\nAlthough the report does not dwell on the implications, it acknowledges that a national power grid failure would lead to a perfect storm requiring emergency military responses that might eventually weaken the ability of the US Army to continue functioning at all: \u201cRelief efforts aggravated by seasonal climatological effects would potentially accelerate the criticality of the developing situation. The cascading effects of power loss\u2026 would rapidly challenge the military\u2019s ability to continue operations.\u201d\n\nAlso at \u201chigh risk of temporary or permanent closure due to climate threats\u201d are US nuclear power facilities.\n\nThere are currently 99 nuclear reactors operating in the US, supplying nearly 20 percent of the country\u2019s utility-scale energy. But the majority of these, some 60 percent, are located in vulnerable regions which face \u201cmajor risks\u201d including sea level rise, severe storms, and water shortages.\n\nContainment\n\nThe report's authors believe that domestic military operations will be necessary to contain future disease outbreaks. There is no clear timeline for this, except the notion of being prepared for imminent surprises: \u201cClimate change is introducing an increased risk of infectious disease to the US population. It is increasingly not a matter of \u2018if\u2019 but of when there will be a large outbreak.\u201d\n\nAreas in the south of the US will see an increase in precipitation of between .5 and .8 mm a day, along with an increase in average annual temperatures of 1 to 3 degrees Celsius (C) by 2050.\n\nAlong with warmer winters, these new conditions will drive the proliferation of mosquitos and ticks. This in turn will spur the spread of diseases \u201cwhich may be previously unseen in the US\u201d, and accelerate the reach of diseases currently found in very small numbers such as Zika, West Nile Virus, Lyme disease, and many others:\n\n\u201cThe US Army will be called upon to assist in much the same way it was called upon in other disasters. Detailed coordination with local, state and federal agencies in the most high risk regions will hasten response time and minimize risk to mission.\u201d\n\nA new era of endless war\n\nThe new report is especially significant given the Trump administration\u2019s climate science denial. Commissioned by General Mark Milley, now the highest ranking military officer in the United States, the report not only concludes that climate change is real, but that it is on track to create an unprecedented catastrophe that could lead to the total collapse of US society without serious investments in new technology and infrastructure. However, while focusing on projected climate impacts, the report does not discuss the causes of climate change in human fossil fuel emissions.\n\nThe report was written by an interdisciplinary team active across several US government agencies, including the White House\u2019s Office of American Innovation, the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Protecting Critical Technology Task Force, NASA\u2019s Harvest Consortium, the US Air Force Headquarters\u2019 Directorate of Weather, the US Army\u2019s National Guard, and the US State Department. The US Army War College did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTheir report not only describes the need for massive permanent military infrastructure on US soil to stave off climate collapse, but portends new foreign interventions due to climate change.\n\nThe authors argue that the Syrian civil war could be a taste of future international conflicts triggered by climate-induced unrest. There is \u201cno question that the conflict erupted coincident with a major drought in the region which forced rural people into Syrian cities as large numbers of Iraqi refugees arrived,\u201d they say.\n\nThe resulting conflict \u201creignited civil war in Iraq,\u201d and heightened military tensions between the US and Russia.\n\n\u201cThe Syrian population has declined by about 10 percent since the start of the war, with millions of refugees fleeing the nation, increasing instability in Europe, and stoking violent extremism,\u201d the report concludes.\n\nThe most urgent case for a potential US intervention, however, is the South Asian country of Bangladesh.\n\nWith half its 160 million-strong population currently living at sea level, some 80 million Bangladeshis are set to be displaced as huge areas of the country become \u201cuninhabitable\u201d due to climate impacts: \u201cHow will this large scale displacement affect global security in a region with nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s population and several antagonistic nuclear powers?\u201d\n\nWith a population eight times that of Syria\u2019s, the report explains, \u201cpermanent displacement of a large portion of the population of Bangladesh would be a regional catastrophe with the potential to increase global instability.\u201d\n\nThe authors recommend the US Army work with the State Department and USAID to \u201cstrengthen the resilience of [Bangladeshi] government agencies and provide training for the Bangladeshi military.\u201d\n\nWater scarcity will destabilize nations\u2014and the U.S. Army\n\nWhile sea level rise offers one specific type of risk, another comes from water scarcity due to climate change, population increase, and poor water management. The report describes water scarcity as a near-term risk driving civil unrest and political instability.\n\nBy 2040, global demand for fresh water will exceed availability, and by 2030 one-third of the world population will inhabit the \u201cwater-stressed regions\u201d of North Africa, Southern Africa, the Middle East, China, and the United States, the report notes.\n\nThe decline in water availability over the next two decades will lead to an increase in \u201csocial disruption\u201d in poor, vulnerable regions.\n\nWater scarcity is also a driver of possible global food system failure, which could trigger new \u201coutbreaks of civil conflict and social unrest.\u201d\n\nThe report depicts a global food system increasingly disrupted by \u201crapid freeze-thaw cycles in spring and fall, soil degradation, depletion of fossil water aquifers, intensified spread of agricultural pests and diseases, and damage to shipping infrastructure as a consequence of flooding.\u201d\n\nSuch food system instability will result in \u201csignificant increases in mortality in vulnerable locations, which are those where DoD-supported humanitarian intervention is most likely.\u201d\n\nBut foreign military interventions, particularly in water scarce regions of the Middle East and North Africa, might not be viable unless the US Army invents or acquires radical new technologies to distribute adequate levels of water to soldiers.\n\nThe problem is so bad and so expensive, the report says, that the Army \u201cis precipitously close to mission failure concerning hydration of the force in a contested arid environment.\u201d\n\nWater is currently 30-40 percent of the costs required to sustain a US military force operating abroad, according to the new Army report. A huge infrastructure is needed to transport bottled water for Army units. So the report recommends major new investments in technology to collect water from the atmosphere locally, without which US military operations abroad could become impossible. The biggest obstacle is that this is currently way outside the Pentagon\u2019s current funding priorities.\n\nRampaging for Arctic oil\n\nAnd yet the report\u2019s biggest blind-spot is its agnosticism on the necessity for a rapid whole society transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nBizarrely for a report styling itself around the promotion of environmental stewardship in the Army, the report identifies the Arctic as a critical strategic location for future US military involvement: to maximize fossil fuel consumption.\n\nNoting that the Arctic is believed to hold about a quarter of the world\u2019s undiscovered hydrocarbon reserves, the authors estimate that some 20 percent of these reserves could be within US territory, noting a \u201cgreater potential for conflict\u201d over these resources, particularly with Russia.\n\nThe melting of Arctic sea ice is depicted as a foregone conclusion over the next few decades, implying that major new economic opportunities will open up to exploit the region\u2019s oil and gas resources as well as to establish new shipping routes: \u201cThe US military must immediately begin expanding its capability to operate in the Artic to defend economic interests and to partner with allies across the region.\u201d\n\nSenior US defense officials in Washington clearly anticipate a prolonged role for the US military, both abroad and in the homeland, as climate change wreaks havoc on critical food, water and power systems. Apart from causing fundamental damage to our already strained democratic systems, the bigger problem is that the US military is by far a foremost driver of climate change by being the world\u2019s single biggest institutional consumer of fossil fuels.\n\nThe prospect of an ever expanding permanent role for the Army on US soil to address growing climate change impacts is a surprisingly extreme scenario which goes against the grain of the traditional separation of the US military from domestic affairs.\n\nIn putting this forward, the report inadvertently illustrates what happens when climate is seen through a narrow \u2018national security\u2019 lens. Instead of encouraging governments to address root causes through \u201cunprecedented changes in all aspects of society\u201d (in the words of the UN\u2019s IPCC report this time last year), the Army report demands more money and power for military agencies while allowing the causes of climate crisis to accelerate. It\u2019s perhaps no surprise that such dire scenarios are predicted, when the solutions that might avert those scenarios aren\u2019t seriously explored.\n\nRather than waiting for the US military to step in after climate collapse\u2014at which point the military itself could be at risk of collapsing\u2014we would be better off dealing with the root cause of the issue skirted over by this report: America\u2019s chronic dependence on the oil and gas driving the destabilization of the planet\u2019s ecosystems.", "description": "The report says a combination of global starvation, war, disease, drought, and a fragile power grid could have cascading, devastating effects.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dae377ebb3ed7000a346efa/lede/1571698967698-THE_US_MILLITARY_SAYS_THE_COLLAPSE_OF_SOCIETY_WILL_HAPPEN_WITHIN_20_YEARS_CS.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
