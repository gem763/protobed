When you start seeing the return on your investments, it's a motivator to put more and more money away. And we definitely don't live frugally.\"\n\nShe said it's all about moderation.\n\n\"We splurge on experiences and we have nice things, but we never enjoyed living paycheck to paycheck,\" she said. \"You don't need to eat out every night of the week. You don't need Starbucks every day. You don't need a new outfit every time you go on a trip.\"\n\nDombrowski said to really look at where your money goes and cut back on some daily things that you really don't need.\n\n\"You'll be shocked how much you start to save,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to cutting down on small expenses and paying off debts, doing some research beforehand on how expensive it will be to live in a specific country is crucial to planning just how much you need to save to retire comfortably.\n\n\"Depending on the location you want to retire to, it can be a lot cheaper to retire overseas,\" Gonzalez said. \"If you already have an idea of where you'd like to retire to, look at the exchange rate in that country, and do some research on living costs. This should allow you to determine how much money you'll need for retirement.\"", "description": "Americans looking to retire abroad have to consider numerous financial angles, like foreign housing markets, healthcare systems, and tax laws.", "authors": ["Natalia Lusinski"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8398e52e22af030e527b52-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
