The survey checked in with more than 2,000 people on their maximum earning potential, also asking how much they currently earned.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median weekly earnings across all ages, races, and both genders was $908 for the most recent quarter of 2019. That translates into just over $47,000 for the year.\n\nDespite having more opportunities to earn a salary of $100,000 or more in their lifetime, a sizable portion of millennials were downbeat about their future earning potential. Over a third said they didn\u2019t believe they would ever achieve a six-figure salary.\n\nThirty-one percent of both millennials and Gen X-ers didn\u2019t believe they would ever pull in $100,000 or more. Unsurprisingly, the number rose for older generations: 36% of baby boomers were downbeat about a potential six-figure salary.\n\nBut despite a gloomy outlook for their own potential earnings, more millennials are earning higher wages than Gen X. A 10th of millennials said they already earn $100,000, compared to 9% of Gen X and 11% of baby boomers \u2013 the only income bracket where boomers earn more than millennials.\n\nAs the income brackets go higher, so does the proportion of millennials earning more than older generations. Four percent of millennials said they earned $250,000, compared to 3% of Gen X-ers and 1% of boomers. At the $500,000 income level, 3% of millennials said they earned that much, compared with 1% for both Gen X and boomers. And surprisingly, 2% percent of millennials are already millionaires, compared to just 1% of boomers surveyed.\n\nPay disparities\n\nThough household net worth increased, and the economy has continued to grow over the past decade, it\u2019s clear that not all Americans are equally making those gains. According to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), wage growth hasn\u2019t bounced back to pre-recession levels, and remains fairly flat. In August, wages grew by 3.2% over the year \u2014 below targets of 3.5%-4%. And most of the gains made in the last decade of economic recovery went to the wealthy.\n\nOn a national level, the top 1% captured 85% of post-recession income growth from 2009 to 2013, according to an Economic Policy Institute study on income inequality. In some states, they recovered 100% of those gains.\n\nGetty Images More\n\nThis matches data from Bankrate that shows that nearly a quarter of Americans believe they are financially \u201cworse\u201d now than they were before the Great Recession. That\u2019s just under 50 million Americans. Another 25% said in the June survey that they are doing the \u201csame.\u201d In all, just over half believed their \u201coverall finances\u201d are better than before.\n\nAccording to IRS figures for tax year 2016 (filed in 2017), less than 20% of all tax returns filed were for an adjusted gross income of $100,000 or more.\n\nAnd of the 9% earning at least $100,000 or more, more than twice as many men earn a six-figure salary than women. Only 6% of women said they earned $100,000 or more, compared to 13% of men surveyed by YouGov.\n\nThis disparity in pay is evident in median weekly earnings, according to the BLS. Women earned a median weekly salary of $814, compared to $1,000 for men.\n\nRacial gaps\n\nThere were also surprising outlooks on earning potential when considering race.\n\nClose to 40% of white respondents didn\u2019t believe they would ever earn $100,000. Despite large pay gaps between blacks, Hispanics, and whites, only 20% of black respondents were downbeat about their future earnings. The number ticked upward for Hispanics; roughly a third of them said they didn\u2019t believe they\u2019d ever reach six figures.", "description": "What is your maximum earning potential?
