He then focused on playing age-grade squash for Wales before studying Performance Analysis at UWIC in Cardiff.\n\nHis journey took him and his laptop from Wales to New Zealand to stormy Yokohama where, on Sunday, he will take up his place behind Japan coach Jamie Joseph in the stands if the game against Scotland goes ahead.\n\nAndrew Watts' journey took him and his laptop from Wales to New Zealand to stormy Japan\n\n\u2018One of my first jobs was at Cardiff Blues and Paul Tito always said he was going to get me a job in Super Rugby,\u2019 Watts said, speaking from the 70th floor of Japan\u2019s team hotel during the typhoon. \u2018I always laughed it off but one day in 2014 I got a text from Jamie Joseph saying, \u201cCan I speak to you?\u201d Four weeks later, I was in New Zealand to join the Highlanders.\n\n\u2018We packed up the family and moved from Cardiff to Dunedin, then Jamie moved over here and now I join up with him during tours and competitions.\u2019\n\nWatts spends many hours behind a laptop, breaking down statistics and video footage of the opposition before devising a counter-plan. He is one of several British analysts working in the southern hemisphere with the All Blacks poaching Jamie Hamilton and the Crusaders signing up Jonathan Gardner.\n\n\u2018One of the goals is to use technology to make the coaching workflow quicker,\u2019 said Watts. \u2018You might look at different correlations between teams, their stats when they win games compared to their stats when they lose.\n\nHosts Japan have won their opening three pool group A games at the World Cup\n\n\u2018If they\u2019re winning all their games when ball-in-play time is high, for example, you look at what their opposition were doing and flip it on its head. I report a trend and the coaches build a game plan around it.\n\n\u2018During a match we produce live stats so we can potentially change things around in-play.\u2019\n\nOne of Japan\u2019s strengths at this World Cup has been their ability to execute a game plan. \u2018The huge difference is their work ethic,\u2019 he said. \u2018Not just Japanese rugby players but Japanese people in general. They work harder than any other nation I\u2019ve been involved with. You have to limit them because they just go and go.\n\n\u2018At our captain\u2019s run in Tokyo we had torrential rain. You had to walk through water up to your knees to get to the training field and no one moaned \u2014 in fact, they laughed!\n\n\u2018Then before they go to bed they study footage of the opposition. There\u2019s a lot of hours behind a screen but you don\u2019t mind that when your plans come off in front of 75,000 people.\u2019", "description": "Meet the English-born expert who has been one of the secret weapons behind Japan's World Cup charge.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/21/19636216-0-image-a-5_1570913354986.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
