In July, deputies approached a federal-state task force on opioid overdoses, which agreed to take the case, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Kyle Mori said.\n\nAttorney Ambrosio Rodriguez, a former Riverside County prosecutor, said it was unusual for federal prosecutors to take over a state investigation. He said he didn\u2019t buy District Attorney Jackie Lacey statements about a lack of admissible evidence, calling her explanation for passing the case to federal prosecutors \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is pickier about what cases they file than the federal government,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a known thing in criminal law that the federal government only files perfect cases. ... They want two helpings of all the evidence in the world.\u201d\n\nLacey has defended her decision not to bring a case sooner or file homicide charges. She said there was insufficient evidence to charge Buck in the deaths, saying it made more sense to proceed with a federal prosecution that would bring a minimum 20-year sentence if he\u2019s convicted.\n\nLacey denied that Buck, who had given her a $100 donation that she later returned, received any favoritism. She said investigators didn\u2019t have the necessary witnesses to make an arrest until the latest victim provided the account that gave them their big break.\n\n\u201cWe did not have other victims that were willing to talk to the prosecutors to tell us what happened, to tell us they were injected by Mr. Buck,\u201d Lacey said.\n\nCLINTON, OBAMA SILENT ON ED BUCK DONATIONS\n\nBuck wasn\u2019t stopped until authorities said a third black man nearly died.\n\n\u201cI said it the last time we were down here that there\u2019s going to be a third victim,\u201d said LaTisha Nixon, whose 26-year-old son, Gemmel Moore, was the first to die. \u201cWe said there\u2019s gonna be a second victim. We kept saying it because we all knew ... Ed Buck didn\u2019t stop doing what he was doing.\u201d\n\nNixon and her supporters welcomed the arrest but criticized the time it took to put Buck behind bars and renewed their questions about whether a wealthy, white Democratic donor benefited because the victims were mostly gay black men and drug users, some of whom were sex workers and homeless.\n\n\u201cIf white gay men had been dying in a black man\u2019s house or anybody\u2019s house, rather, this case would have been taken a lot more seriously,\u201d said Jasmyne Cannick, a communications strategist who spearheaded the effort to get justice for Moore. \u201cEd Buck knew who he was preying on, and he knew that people would not care. Or he thought that people would not care.\u201d\n\nBuck, 65, was arrested Sept. 17 after the third man was hospitalized for an overdose.\n\nThe Los Angeles County district attorney charged Buck with running a drug house. Two days later, U.S. prosecutors charged him with distributing methamphetamine resulting in Moore\u2019s death.\n\nBuck is being held without bail and has yet to enter a plea in either case. His attorneys declined to comment, but one defense lawyer, Seymour Amster, previously said Buck denied any role in the deaths of Moore or Timothy Dean, 55, who overdosed Jan. 7.\n\nMoore was found naked on a mattress on Buck\u2019s living room floor on July 27, 2017. Two dozen syringes and five glass pipes were found, along with meth stored in a toolbox with sex toys.\n\nBuck has donated tens of thousands of dollars to California candidates, including Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, and is well known in LGBTQ political circles. According to federal records, Buck contributed more than $500,000 to Democratic groups, including $1,500 to Barack Obama's presidential campaign and $2,950 to the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\nWhen Moore was carried out of Buck\u2019s apartment two years ago, members of the gay political club he lavished with thousands of dollars in political donations swiftly ousted him.\n\nBuck attempted a comeback in early January, less than six months after prosecutors declined to bring charges in the overdose death. He tried to crash the Stonewall Democratic Club\u2019s holiday party at a Los Angeles-area wine bar, telling members he had been exonerated, club president Lester Aponte said.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody dies at your house, wouldn\u2019t you think that\u2019s the kind of event that will make you reexamine your life choices?\u201d Aponte told The Associated Press. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it registered with him at all.\u201d\n\nTwo days after Buck was escorted out of the bash, another gay man was found dead in his West Hollywood apartment \u2014 again from a methamphetamine overdose.\n\nThe federal criminal complaint, however, said eight men had provided harrowing accounts about encounters with Buck before the latest alleged victim survived overdosing twice in a week this month. That man said he lived with Buck for weeks this summer and Buck regularly injected him with meth.\n\nSeveral of those men said Buck encouraged them to take drugs or injected them himself \u2014 some against their will and others who said they woke up to being injected or suspected they had been given a powerful drug before passing out.\n\nOne man, who was homeless and worked as a prostitute, told investigators in March that Buck was known as Dr. Kevorkian, a reference to the late doctor who'd been imprisoned for helping terminally ill patients end their lives. The man said Buck injected him twice with meth in 2011 and he lost consciousness each time.\n\n\u201cBuck insists on injecting prostitutes with methamphetamine and ... would dismiss anyone who would not permit it without compensation,\u201d according to an affidavit by Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Mundell.\n\nLacey, the district attorney, said witnesses were reluctant or had \u201clawyered up\u201d and wouldn\u2019t speak, while others didn\u2019t have firsthand encounters with Buck.\n\nCannick, the communications strategist, and two lawyers representing Moore\u2019s mother in a lawsuit against Buck, the district attorney and the sheriff\u2019s department, disputed the prosecutor\u2019s assertions. They said they accompanied victims mentioned in the criminal complaint to interviews with sheriff\u2019s deputies and provided text messages, photos, videos and receipts of electronic payments Buck made.\n\nThe witnesses all spoke with Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s investigators, who consulted frequently with county prosecutors, said Lt. Derrick Alfred, who oversaw the team of detectives who investigated Dean\u2019s death. He said the activists were integral by finding witnesses.\n\nMoore\u2019s death was originally listed as an accidental overdose. A criminal investigation wasn\u2019t launched for about three weeks, after Cannick said she published excerpts from a journal Moore kept that said he had become addicted to drugs and \u201cEd Buck is the one to thank.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nBefore Buck could be charged in federal court, investigators learned of the latest overdose and finally made an arrest.\n\nWhen Buck was taken into custody, \u201che acted confused, seemingly wondering why we were there and what was going on,\u201d Alfred said.\n\nA small crowd, including Cannick, gathered across the street from the building where protesters had once posted signs saying, \u201cJustice 4 Gemmel\u201d and \u201cEd Buck is a Predator!\u201d\n\nWithin a week, an eviction notice was posted on Buck\u2019s door. It cited the illegal drugs and the deaths of two men found inside.", "description": "Although the alleged victims\u2019 families and their supporters warned about California\u00a0Democratic activist and\u00a0megadonor Ed Buck\u00a0for two years as they tried to get prosecutors to bring charges, their pleas weren\u2019t heard.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
