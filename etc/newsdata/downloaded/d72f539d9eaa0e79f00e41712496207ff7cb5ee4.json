Thank you Josh Boone and @cbsallaccess. My @StephenKing fangirl heart is floating today,\u2019 shared Kat.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar, The Stand presents a world where a deadly plague has killed off 99 percent of the population, and was previously adapted into an ABC miniseries in 1994.\n\nMarsden will play Stu Redman, an ordinary, working-class factory man who becomes a leader of the survivors.\n\nHeard has been cast as Nadine Cross, a conflicted woman who is compelled by her allegiance to Randall Flagg, the Dark Man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTV Line reports that McNamara will play Julie Lawry, \u2018a small-town girl with a wild side who has a run-in with Lloyd (Nat Wolff) in Las Vegas\u2019.\n\nAnnounced during CBS All Access\u2019 summer Television Critics Association presentation, it was also revealed Stephen King will write the final episode of the series \u2013 which serves as a \u2018new coda\u2019 going beyond events in the book.\n\nJosh Boone is set to direct the series and act as writer and executive producer with Ben Cavell. Roy Lee, Jimmy Miller and Richard P. Rubinstein will also serve as executive producers.\n\nIt\u2019s one of many Stephen King adaptations in the pipeline, with IT Chapter Two released in cinemas in September while Doctor Sleep starring Ewan McGregor releases later in 2019.\n\nKat as Clary Fray in Shadowhunters (Picture: Freeform)\n\nKat\u2019s role comes after she was confirmed for a new \u2018female-centric\u2019 addition to TV\u2019s Arrowverse, with the spin-off focusing on her character Mia Smoak, Oliver Queen and Felicity Smoak\u2019s daughter.\n\nA spin-off has been floated by fans ever since Mia entered the scene in season six and her character\u2019s identity was revealed in season seven, but the news also proves that DC Comics have a smart and exciting stronghold on the small screen when it comes to inclusivity and diversity \u2013 and it may be time for Marvel to take a long hard look at themselves.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
