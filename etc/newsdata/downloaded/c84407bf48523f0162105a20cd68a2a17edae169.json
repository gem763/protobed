The chief bridesmaid lost weight ahead of the wedding, and the frock was too big \u2013 seemingly leaving her with just one option.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nWith her sister\u2019s blessing, the cheeky maid of honor slipped into the inflatable T-rex look to the outdoor summer ceremony \u2013 and never looked back.\n\n\u201cIt was hot!\u201d Meador said of wearing full-body costume. \u201cI remember being surprised that everyone seemed to be doing their best to avoid noticing the elephant in the room (or should I say dino) but it was hard to see in the costume.\u201d\n\nChanging out of the costume for the reception, the jokester later shared a must-see photo of the ceremony to Facebook \u2013 though she never expected it to go quite so far and wide.\n\nThough Meador says that commenters have largely praised the silly stunt as creative and original, some critics have accused her of trying to steal her sister\u2019s thunder.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe newlywed, however, has since clapped back with opinions of her own, defending her \u201cawesome\u201d little sister and the innovative look.\n\n\u201cIt's not a joke, it's a giant middle finger at spending thousands of dollars and putting ungodly amounts of pressure on ourselves just to please a bunch of people who, in the end, only want free food and drinks,\u201d Adams said, telling off one Facebook commenter. \u201cThe point was to get married to the man who treats me like I hung the moon, and we did that part.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sister is awesome and I genuinely was not kidding when I said she could wear whatever she wanted,\u201d the laid-back bride added.", "description": "\"If I'm spending more than $50, I want it to be a dinosaur costume, because they're fantastic and I've always wanted one.'\"", "authors": ["Janine Puhak", "Christina Meador", "Maid Of Honor", "Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.
