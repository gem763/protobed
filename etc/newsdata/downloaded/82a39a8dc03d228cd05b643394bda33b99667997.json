People even began lining up outside two days before.\n\nBut outside there were hundreds of protesters. And despite the presence of police, Trump supporters were harassed and attacked outside the venue. The police themselves were harassed, with protesters calling them \u201cpigs\u201d and trying to incite them. Police had to use pepper spray on some of the protesters.\n\nBreaking: outside Minneapolis Trump rally. Protestors lighting Maga hats on fire. Rushing police. Calling them pigs, etc. Escalating scene. pic.twitter.com/HxUFzs8OWF \u2014 Matt Finn (@MattFinnFNC) October 11, 2019\n\nWe reported on attacks on Trump supporters outside of President Donald Trump\u2019s Minnesota rally.\n\nNow, more video has emerged. The video shows more of just how unhinged some on the left are and the scary nature of the leftist mob violence.\n\nThey chased after one man after someone called out, \u201cThere\u2019s a Nazi over there,\u201d attacking him as he tries to get away, smacking him.\n\nA man leaving tonight's Trump rally in Minnesota was spotted by a group of protesters who yelled: \u201cThere\u2019s a Nazi over here!\u201d They then attacked the man, slapping and pushing him until he ran away. pic.twitter.com/HfL2kKE9jn \u2014 Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) October 11, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s another view of that same encounter as the man flees the mob.\n\nTrump supporters are literally fleeing the event after it ended as protestors are waiting around attacking attendees as they leave the arena It is not safe in Minneapolis any longer for Trump supporters. Please stay away from the vicinity and do not come out with branded gear pic.twitter.com/BLsJbtct0k \u2014 Elijah Schaffer (@ElijahSchaffer) October 11, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s the very tolerant left surrounding a man, hitting him in the head, smacking the Trump hat off his head and then stealing his hat.\n\nTrump supporters outside the rally in Minnesota last night were routinely attacked by left wing activists w/out provocation One man here who was peacefully observing the crowd was surrounded by protestors & assaulted for wearing a Trump hat This was not uncommon. #Tolerance pic.twitter.com/374ns5fAJp \u2014 Elijah Schaffer (@ElijahSchaffer) October 11, 2019\n\nSchaffer reported there were many such encounters where Trump and MAGA hats were stolen.\n\nHow unhinged are they? Well, you have to be pretty unhinged when you assault someone in the middle of a live interview.\n\nVIDEO: Protester spits on Trump supporter during interview at Minneapolis rally https://t.co/WIN6yJDsqf pic.twitter.com/sXIpvDZbRn \u2014 VICE News (@vicenews) October 11, 2019\n\nBut this shows, right here, the difference between the right and the unhinged left. The Vice interviewer was justifiably shocked. But the Trump supporter shrugs it off, continues on with the focus of the interview as the coward flees. Two of the protesters apologize for the coward, although one equates the hat with being as hateful as the spit again, showing the lack of reality even in the person who had enough sense to apologize.\n\nTrump folks should put this in an ad and play it on a loop: this is what we are fighting against.", "description": "Watch: Video That Shows How Unhinged The Left Has Become", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Brandon Morse", "Alex Parker", "C.
