Misgendering is when a person is referred to by any pronouns other than the ones they use. Deadnaming is when a person is referred to by the name they used before they transitioned. Referring to someone by their deadname is considered insensitive and harmful.\n\nThis 'epidemic' has been going on for years\n\nA 2018 report from ProPublica found that about 65 different law enforcement agencies across the country have investigated murders of transgender people since January 2015. In 74 of 85 cases, victims were either misgendered or deadnamed. The outlet also found that arrests have been made in 55% of the killings of transgender people in the US.\n\nA person holds a transgender flag.
