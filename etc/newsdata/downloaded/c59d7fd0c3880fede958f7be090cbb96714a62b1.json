How? Well, it's something we all know but rarely ever follow - the art of ignoring. Below we tell you how to master it.\n\nPexels\n\nIgnore your insecurities.\n\nWe have to ignore anything that makes us feel uncertain. We have to ignore the voice in our head that constantly tells us to give up. We need to train our mind to always look for the positive in every situation. We need to develop a state of mind that can transform hell into heaven. We have to ignore our insecurities to the extent they stop determining our behavior. You could be insecure about your weight, your talent, your appearance but you need to ignore them and just live. You are you.\n\nIgnore the drama.\n\nIgnore people who only come to you for gossip. Ignore people who only feed you with negative things about other people. Ignore anything that feels wrong. Ignore anything that makes you feel worthless, as if you don't matter. By ignoring all this, you will be opening space for things that you love and things that make you feel good, bringing you one step closer to living a peaceful life.\n\nPexels\n\nIgnore the hatred.\n\nStop giving your haters power by letting them get into your head. Ignore those who hate you but if you get a chance to show kindness to them, don't forego that chance in the name of hating them back. By being kind to your haters, you aren't only being nice to them but in a lot of ways, you are being nice to yourself.\n\nIgnore the critics.\n\nWe have to ignore unsolicited advice, opinions or the poisonous arguments that some people might feed us. We need to stop listening to how things didn't work for them or how they did. Simply because our experience is never going to the same, so why let go of our ambitions and things that we love because it din't work out for someone else? Ignore their suggestions and do what feels right.\n\nPexels\n\nIgnore the pain.\n\nStart ignoring people or a certain activity that has the power to cause you even the slightest of pain. It's never worth it. Ignore things that take away your peace of mind.\n\nIgnore some of your questions.\n\n\"Will I ever be in love?\"\n\n\"Will I ever be happy?\"\n\n\"Will I ever stop being lonely?\"\n\nStop seeking answers. Ignore these questions that only give rise to self-doubt. Just have faith. The thing about loneliness is that it feels like it will last forever, but it won't. Live a little and let go.\n\nIt's really hard to ignore things that bother us or mean the world to us. But these are burdens we carry on our shoulders. Let them go and embrace peace.", "description": "What's the secret to living a peaceful and quiet life?
