This never-ending fusillade makes it is easy to lose sight of his individual acts of lowering (or demolishing) standards. Yet on Thursday morning, Trump\u2019s top intelligence official presented a stunning reminder that Trump has violated what ought to be an important principle: A president should not brazenly lie and make shit up.\n\nA president should not brazenly lie and make shit up.\n\nYes, I know, Trump does this All The Time. And everyone\u2014the media, Democratic and Republican lawmakers, and citizens throughout the land\u2014have become inured to his audacious prevarications. Often, his false claims are directly contradicted by his own hirelings. (Case in point: Virtually all of Trump\u2019s top national security appointees have stated they accept the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia covertly intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump, though Trump has repeatedly discounted or dismissed this finding.) Yet it still is important to push the pause button when one of Trump\u2019s senior advisers publicly undermines Trump\u2019s demagoguery and offers evidence that Trump is a doesn\u2019t-give-a-damn-about-the-truth deceiver-in-chief. And that\u2019s what happened when acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire appeared before the House Intelligence Committee for a fiery hearing focused on Trump\u2019s latest scandal: the president\u2019s alleged attempt to muscle the Ukrainian president to produce dirt he could use to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and to harm Joe Biden.\n\nThe subject, of course, was Maguire\u2019s handling of a complaint sent by an unidentified intelligence official to the inspector general for the intelligence community that accused the president of abusing his office for political purposes and that claimed White House officials tried to bury evidence of this misconduct. It\u2019s this controversy that has finally pushed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to declare that House Democrats were transforming their multiple investigations of Trump into an impeachment inquiry. Since this story emerged days ago, Trump has been fighting back in his usual manner of denying reality and disseminating false narratives and charges\u2014that is, gaslighting. And a key component of his counter-attack has been denigrating the anonymous whistleblower.\n\nTrump has brutally gone after the whistleblower in a series of tweets. He questioned his or her loyalty, asking, \u201cIs he on our Country\u2019s side\u201d? He called this member of the intelligence community \u201chighly partisan\u201d and suggested this person was part of a conspiracy mounted against Trump by Democrats and the media. In a tweet citing a Fox News analyst, Trump accused the whistleblower of spying on him by secretly listening to his conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. (Trump was suggesting the whistleblower had committed a criminal act.) In another tweet citing another right-wing commentator, Trump essentially said the whistleblower was part of a cabal mounting a malicious and seditious effort against him. And Trump retweeted a conservative activist who claimed that the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general had concluded the whistleblower had a \u201cpolitical bias\u201d against Trump. (The IG found \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate\u201d but nevertheless determined that the whistleblower was credible.)\n\nThat is, before the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was released on Thursday morning, Trump had mounted a robust smear campaign against this unknown person, pronouncing him or her a rat-fink and a traitor who was out to get Trump\u2014a person whose complaint could not be taken seriously.\n\nAt the Maguire hearing, the acting DNI was asked about the whistleblower\u2014whose identity remained a secret. Is the whistleblower a \u201cpolitical hack,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the committee queried. Maguire replied, \u201cI believer the whistleblower is acting in good faith.\u201d Schiff followed up: \u201cYou don\u2019t have any reason to accuse them of disloyalty to our country?\u201d Maguire provided an unequivocal response: \u201cAbsolutely not\u2026I think the whistleblower did the right thing.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there was no basis for Trump\u2019s denunciations of the whistleblower.\n\nLater in the hearing, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) returned to this subject. She asked Maguire, \u201cDo you believe the whistleblower was spying\u2026on the president?\u201d Maguire answered, \u201cI believe the whistleblower complied with the law and did everything they thought, he or she thought was responsible under the Intelligence Community Whistleblowers Protection Act.\u201d Referring to one of Trump\u2019s tweets, Speier continued: \u201cDo you believe the whistleblower is on our country\u2019s side?\u201d Maguire replied, \u201cI believe that the whistleblower and all employees who come forward to the [intelligence community] IG to raise concerns of fraud, waste, and abuse are doing what they perceive to be the right thing.\u201d That was a careful answer, but surely no endorsement of Trump\u2019s claim that the whistleblower was engaged in treasonous action.\n\nSpeier then asked Maguire if Trump had asked him to share the identity of the whistleblower. \u201cI can tell you emphatically no,\u201d he said. And had anyone else in the White House or Justice Department done so? \u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\nSo if Trump and the White House did not know the whistleblower\u2019s identity, how could Trump question this person\u2019s loyalty, blast him or her as a partisan plotter, and accuse the whistleblower of spying? You know the answer: Trump doesn\u2019t need facts to mount a smear campaign. (Did Roy Cohn?) Trump concocts phony conspiracies and misleading narratives all the time. (Remember birtherism?) When caught in a misdeed, his first instinct is to attack and vilify, the truth be damned. After all, when has Trump been held accountable for such malfeasance?\n\nThe Ukraine scandal is yet another indication that Trump places his private interests over public service and recognizes few restraints when it comes to abusing the power of his office. And this instance of his lies being revealed by the man who runs the intelligence community for Trump signals yet again that Trump is a serial fabulist. In days past, a president caught in such blatant lying might actual suffer consequences\u2014at least, a few pokes in the media and perhaps even within his own party for besmirching a US government official. These days, this Trump lie is just another piece of straw in one huge haystack. Trump\u2019s intelligence chief tells us that Trump is a liar\u2014and though the contradiction has drawn media attention, Trump\u2019s action is hardly covered as outrageous. That\u2019s a sign of Trump\u2019s victory in his war against the norm of honesty.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Corn", "Washington", "Dc", "Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190926-trump-tarmac.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
