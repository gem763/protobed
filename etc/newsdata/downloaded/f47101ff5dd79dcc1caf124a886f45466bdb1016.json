The heat between the two sides has flared up to an intense degree as they run it back, and from one side in particular, there\u2019s been some harsh words.\n\nStephens said at Tuesday\u2019s open workout that if Rodriguez \u201cdoesn\u2019t die, it don\u2019t count.\u201d Those are bold comments even for the fight game, and Rodriguez thinks it\u2019s a reflection on how mentally fragile Stephens is going into that fight \u2013 so much so that Rodriguez said he\u2019s not eager to push any more of his opponent\u2019s buttons.\n\n\u201cI think everybody has their own battles to deal with. If he thinks that way, then God bless him, bro, because he\u2019s in the deep (expletive) right here (in his head),\u201d Rodriguez said at Wedneday\u2019s UFC on ESPN 6 media day. \u201cI think he already has a lot of problems in his life and stuff that he has to deal with that I don\u2019t even want to really keep pushing too much into his head. I want him fresh for this fight because he\u2019s a tough opponent and I don\u2019t want him to be weak. He\u2019s just showing me that he\u2019s weak, and I want him fresh. I want you fresh, bro.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN 6 takes place Friday at TD Garden in Boston. Rodriguez vs. Stephens co-headlines the card, which airs entirely on ESPN2.\n\nThe first fight less than a month ago took place on Rodriguez\u2019s home turf in Mexico City at high elevation. Moreover, it was scheduled for five rounds. Stephens thought he was giving Rodriguez all the advantages in that situation. But with three rounds at play for the rematch, and at sea level, \u201cEl Pantera\u201d said he\u2019s only going to be more dangerous.\n\n\u201cI think this fight is completely different,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different opponent because of his mindset. I changed my strategy, as well. If I can fight five rounds in high altitude, I can do three in sea level.\u201d", "description": "Yair Rodriguez thinks he's deep inside Jeremy Stephens' head in advance of their highly anticipated rematch at UFC on ESPN 6.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Simon Head", "The Blue Corner", "Abbey Subhan", "Simon Samano"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/yair-rodriguez-ufc-boston-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
