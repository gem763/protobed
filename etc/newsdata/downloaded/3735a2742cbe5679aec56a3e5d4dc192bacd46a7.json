After the Robert Mueller report, Trump looked to be running next November without the distraction of a trial for his political life, freed up to pursue deals in the Persian Gulf, the DMZ, in Beijing and in Kabul.\n\nBut now warhawk winds are blowing again\u2014a deal with the mullahs seems less likely than war\u2014even as the knives are out for the president in Congress\u2019 lower chamber. Trump fights with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo feuds with Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.\n\nTrump\u2019s third address to the United Nations General Assembly barely registered Tuesday. The sordid news out of Ukraine engulfs not only the president himself but also, in a wild twist, the former vice president, the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer White House chief strategist and Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon told me that American politics can now be bifurcated into a \u201cpre 5 pm world\u201d and a \u201cpost 5 pm world,\u201d a nod to Pelosi\u2019s bombshell close of business announcement of an impeachment inquiry. \u201cHis presidency can be divided by that line of demarcation,\u201d Bannon said.\n\nIt is against this backdrop the Trump campaign team will pursue a strategy for re-election that is controversial even within Republican ranks. In 2016, Trump won by leveling Democrats\u2019 vaunted Midwestern blue wall, winning Rust Belt states that in some cases hadn\u2019t voted Republican since the 1980s. These states have older, whiter populations and economic problems, in contrast with the affluent, growing, and increasingly diverse Sun Belt, which runs from the country\u2019s southeast to southwest. That\u2019s why some within the Trump re-election effort itself are quietly rumbling about the strategy favored by campaign manager Brad Parscale and his political kingmaker, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nKushner has been telling the conservative donor circuit that Republicans could be competitive in the Mountain West, namely Colorado, and even the Pacific Northwest, namely Oregon, a state last targeted by the GOP with any seriousness in 2012 by Mitt Romney.\n\nKushner has also told Republican grandees that the African-American vote is ripe for conservative capture. And the senior counselor to the president believes some ex-convicts are registering to vote as Republicans, with gratuitously imprisoned African Americans among the central beneficiaries of the administration\u2019s criminal justice reform. The appointment of Robert O\u2019Brien as national security adviser was orchestrated in part because of the Trump family\u2019s esteem for how the former hostage negotiator facilitated the Swedish release of American rap star A$AP Rocky.\n\nSome are worried that other administration policies\u2014such as the new crackdown on e-cigarettes\u2014could complicate the Kushner-favored approach toward new constituencies, including the young.\n\nMuch depends on who the Democrats nominate. Representative Matt Gaetz and others in Trump\u2019s orbit have told me the president prefers to run against Joe Biden. Earlier this year, when Biden\u2019s stock in the race was higher, the president said as much. \u201cLooks to me like it\u2019s going to be SleepyCreepy Joe over Crazy Bernie. Everyone else is fading fast!\u201d he tweeted in May. Some campaign staffers and interlocutors whisper that this giddiness is a mistake. Hailing from the Irish Catholic middle class, the Scranton-born former vice president and senator could help reclaim the Midwest for the Left. Biden\u2019s popularity with African Americans could stretch the map in the South into Georgia, a state Barack Obama nearly won in 2008.\n\nBut if the Democrats anoint Elizabeth Warren, it\u2019s a different race. That\u2019s how the Kushner-Parscale approach could actually work. A little noticed news item this month: New Mexico\u2019s Democratic governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, has signaled she wants to waive college tuition in the state. For the Left, what would normally be another happy sign of America\u2019s socialist lurch could be a foreboding development. New Mexico is rich\u2013 awash in fracking money. Who wants to ban fracking? Warren, the senior senator from Massachusetts. Republican operatives are gleeful at the prospect of capital Wall Street money splitting from the Democrats. This also happened in 2012, when finance favored Romney. As a Republican staffer told McClatchy reporter David Catanese this week: \u201cI\u2019m so excited. She is the only one we can beat.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic contest looks to be a slog, however\u2014a potentially brutal three-way race between Biden, Warren, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. For now, amid the din of impeachment, a nervous Right waits to see the shape of things to come.\n\nCurt Mills is senior writer for The American Conservative.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shutterstock_560025514.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
