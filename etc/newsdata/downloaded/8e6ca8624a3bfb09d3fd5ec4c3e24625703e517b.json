Bernie Sanders at 19 percent and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 18 percent are the top contenders by far in the Post-ABC poll \u2014 attracting the support of approximately two-thirds of those registered Democratic voters polled.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris sits in fourth place with 7 percent, followed by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent.\n\nOnly four others drew more than 1 percent support.\n\nBiden has another advantage reflected in the poll: 45 percent of those polled list the former vice president as having the best chance to defeat President Donald Trump.\n\nOf course, no votes have been cast yet, and none will be cast for a few months yet. But polling of this nature suggests the race has taken shape in a way that might make it difficult for those trailing far behind to make up ground.\n\nPresumably those long shots are looking toward Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate in Houston \u2014 and taking note of the line in the Post-ABC poll where 55 percent of those polled say they\u2019d consider switching to a different Democratic candidate.\n\nThe Post-ABC poll was a national sample of 1,003 adults conducted by phone Sept. 2-5. The margin of error was listed as plus/minus 6 percentage points.", "description": "Biden, Warren and Sanders are attracting the support of about two-thirds of Democrats polled.", "authors": ["David Cohen"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f2/90/703248154eafa3a33c3d57fb6426/gettyimages-1164688320-700.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
