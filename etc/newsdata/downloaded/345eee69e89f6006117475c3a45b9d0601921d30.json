Grab Your Wallet had an early win when its call for consumers to boycott Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion line and stores that carried it appeared to contribute to a decline in sales. Trump closed her brand last year. Most brands on Grab Your Wallet\u2019s list were targeted for financial ties to Trump, including SoulCycle and the Hudson Yards mall in Manhattan. Stephen Ross, the developer of Hudson Yards and chairman of Equinox-owned SoulCycle, held a fundraiser for Trump in August. LVMH is the first owner of consumer brands to make the list that is not financially involved with the Trump family or administration. It\u2019s unlikely that the boycott will have a massive effect on the luxury behemoth; LVMH owns companies like Sephora, C\u00e9line, Givenchy, and Dior just to name a few, and saw record profits of \u20ac6.4 billion in 2018. Louis Vuitton is expected to net \u20ac12 billion in sales this year.\n\nBut Shannon Coulter, one of Grab Your Wallet\u2019s founders, told BOF that people hate Trump more than they care about Americans being employed.\n\n\u201cCreating jobs is not an excuse to ignore morally repugnant behavior,\u201d Coulter said in the BOF report. \u201cBusinesses are willing to look the other way in order to work with the Trump administration, but it\u2019s a worrisome trend.\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump, Trump\u2019s daughter and an adviser to the president; Department of Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia; and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also attended the opening.\n\n\u201cThe French luxury house opened the factory as part of a commitment it made to the Trump Administration to create more manufacturing jobs in the US,\u201d BOF reported. \u201cIn 2018, Louis Vuitton signed the Pledge to America\u2019s Workers, a Trump initiative that was also signed by Google, Amazon, and Ford.\u201d\n\nSome of the other businesses targeted for boycott because of association with the Trump administration include AT&T; Bank of America, Merrill Lynch; BP; Hobby Lobby; L.L. Bean; NASCAR; New Balance; Shell Oil; and WWE.\n\nWegmans grocery chain is also on the list because it sells Trump wine products.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.", "description": "A left-wing group is urging consumers to boycott Louis Vuitton products after President Trump visited a new factory in Texas last week.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Trump-Louis-Vuitton-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
