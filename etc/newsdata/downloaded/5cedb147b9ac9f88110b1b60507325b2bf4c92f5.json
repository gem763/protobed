To become licensed, pharmacists must pass the state exam and a national exam that focuses on clinical skills.\n\nThe decision has caused an uproar among those who had expected to begin their careers after years of costly pharmacy school.\n\nSteven Nassar, 29, of Los Angeles told the Times he lost an opportunity with a major healthcare provider when the results from his July exam did not come through by September.\n\nNassar said he is trying to negotiate with his loan servicer to delay the beginning of payment on more than $277,000 in student debt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to come by these kind of positions, and it\u2019s frustrating that we have go through this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then with our loans kicking in in November for most of us, it\u2019s daunting.\u201d\n\nLayla Mina, 28, of Anaheim said a pharmacy job offer was rescinded because she could not become licensed and she now works at a mall clothing store.\n\nMina said people who retake the exam next month are not likely to be licensed until next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really fair to any of us,\u201d she said.\n\nState Assemblyman Jim Patterson, a Republican, said there has to be a better process than retesting.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re throwing thousands of people under the bus who played by the rules - they didn\u2019t cheat and yet they\u2019re being treated as if they did,\u201d he said.\n\nDavila said the agency will continue to consider the issue.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Los Angeles Times, http://www.latimes.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "California authorities have invalidated test scores of 1,400 pharmacists because more than 100 questions from the state licensing exam were leaked online.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/02/05/state_of_union_fact_check_37328_c0-109-2613-1633_s1200x700.jpg?415290a54e4491dac7a89582074c79e738d75f0a", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
