The under-par performances in Maharashtra and Haryana are a warning sign that the party cannot ignore with some more state elections on the way. After giving BJP a phenomenal victory in the Lok Sabha elections, electors appear to have voted differently in the assembly elections. Far from Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis\u2019s target of 220+ for the BJP-Sena alliance, it has managed a simple majority with the NCP-Congress alliance lurking around the psychologically important three-figure mark.\n\nIn Haryana, the mortification is greater. From \u201cAb ki baar sattar paar\u201d (This time, we will cross 70) the BJP is down to being the single largest party requiring the support of smaller parties like Dushyant Chautala\u2019s Jannayak Janata Party, INLD or independents.\n\nFor the opposition, there is much to take heart in the results. Veterans like Sharad Pawar and BS Hooda have proven their utility to the opposition. There seems to be an undercurrent against local BJP leaders, going by how the opposition has performed better than what the exit polls were willing to grant it. The opposition will need to work harder to negate BJP\u2019s advantage in terms of resources and visibility. BJP is undoubtedly bolstered by the persona of Prime Minister Narendra Modi but in state elections it is unfair to ask the PM to do the heavy lifting everywhere. State governments may also be the lightning rod for voters discontented with the economy\u2019s troubles.\n\nRead Also: Maharashtra election results: BJP-Shiv Sena on road to power\n\nRead Also: Haryana election results 2019: Haryana heads for hung assembly\n\nRead Also: Dushyant Chautala\u2019s JJP emerges big winner in Haryana polls.
