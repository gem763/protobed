Rounds wrote to McCauley:\n\n\"It is profoundly disappointing that my colleagues chose to address your peers in such an ominous tone, which I fear may put a chill on innovation in the long run.\"\n\nInnovation in securities\n\nThe Senator called the negative reactions toward the creation and launch of Libra \"puzzling\" considering the antiquity of the legal framework in the U.S. Rounds claims that there is no clear legal way to decide whether a cryptocurrency is a security or not, while the only legal foundation they do have is rooted in an outdated Securities Act of 1933, adding:\n\n\"That law was written more than half a century before computers and the internet were created, more than two decades before Hawai'i was admitted to the Union, a decade before the jet engine was developed, and in a period of time in which 90 percent of rural America lacked electricity.\u201d\n\nRounds concluded his letter by thanking Anchorage for its perseverance and willingness to \u201ctake risks to improve the lives of Americans and neighbors across the globe.\u201d\n\nLibra not in jeopardy without PayPal or Visa\n\nCointelegraph recently reported that Calibra\u2019s David Marcus argued that Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency project is absolutely not in jeopardy after PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, eBay, Mercado Pago and Booking quit the Libra Association.
