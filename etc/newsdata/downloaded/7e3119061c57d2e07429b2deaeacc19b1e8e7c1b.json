After two major league games, an impressive one is taking shape.\n\nLewis broke up a no-hitter bid with a home run for the second consecutive game, helping the Mariners to a 5-3 win over Sonny Gray and the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know guys as well for sure when they first come up,\u201d Reds manager David Bell said. \u201cBut we have an idea how to attack him. It says a lot about him. His first couple games, you can clearly see why he\u2019s been a top prospect and talent. It doesn\u2019t\u2019 take long to see that. He\u2019s a guy that just kind of pops out at you. You can see it when he walks out on the field. It looks like he\u2019s going to be a good one.\u201d\n\nJust as he did on Tuesday night against the Reds\u2018 Trevor Bauer, Lewis delivered Seattle\u2019s first hit of the game with a towering homer. In Tuesday\u2019s 4-3 win, Lewis hit a solo home run to left field in the fifth inning for his first career hit. On Wednesday, he sent Gray\u2019s 105th pitch of the game into right field for a three-run homer in the seventh, his second major league hit.\n\n\u201cThe way the ball jumps off the bat, we\u2019ve seen a few guys with that kind of power here,\u201d Mariners manager Scott Servais said. \u201cThat ball was in the air forever.\u201d\n\nLewis is the 24th rookie since 1908 to homer in each of his first two games, and the third Mariners player to accomplish the feat. The 6-foot-4 right fielder is one of the crown jewels in the Mariners\u2018 rebuild. He\u2019s getting his first taste of the majors after being called up with three other prized rookies on Tuesday and is quickly becoming a clubhouse favorite because of his timely hits and inspiring backstory after recovering from a catastrophic knee injury.\n\nAfter hustling around the bases Tuesday night, Lewis admitted he tried to enjoy the experience Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI tried to make a point to slow down a little bit, jog, try to feel it out and feel the energy,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThat was really cool.\u201d\n\nGray struck out nine against a lineup that included four rookies. He was rarely threatened, but was done in by a few long at-bats and a sloppy start to the seventh, when he hit Austin Nola with a pitch, then walked Kyle Seager.\n\nThe Mariners have been no-hit twice in 2019. No team has been no-hit three times in a season.\n\nGray, a free agent signing before this season, was pulled after allowing a single to Daniel Vogelbach, one batter after Lewis. He matched his season high with 111 pitches in 6 1/3 innings. It was his third career two-hit performance.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just found ways to get better each time out,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWhen we acquired him, he\u2019d had a lot of success in his career, he had the stuff and he had the track record as a very solid pitcher. But he\u2019s found ways to get better. I know he\u2019s comfortable here and we have a good support system around him. But he deserves all the credit because he\u2019s been able to build. Each time out he\u2019s been able to just get better as a pitcher.\u201d\n\nNola and Seager added RBI hits in the eighth inning against reliever Kevin Gausman to secure the win for Marco Gonzales (15-11). The lefthander struck out seven and allowed five hits in seven innings as he extended his career-best win total. He gave up an RBI double to Joey Votto in the third and a solo home run to Phillip Ervin in the fourth, then didn\u2019t allow another hit.\n\nBrandon Brennan struck out two in a 1-2-3 eighth and Anthony Bass earned his fourth save and second in two nights with two strikeouts.\n\nAsked what he thought of the rookie who came up big, Gonzales smiled and asked, \u201cWhich one?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for him, just to come up here and have an impact like that,\u201d Gonzales said of Lewis. \u201cJust to break up a no-hitter two days in a row, you don\u2019t see that. From a first-year guy you definitely don\u2019t see that. I\u2019m really proud of him.\u201d\n\nMANAGER MELTDOWN\n\nSeattle manager Scott Servais was ejected by home plate umpire John Libka in the bottom of the ninth inning.\n\nServais was steamed that the umpires counted a run that scored when pinch-hitter Derek Dietrich\u2019s back swing deflected his third strike to the backstop, allowing a run to score with bases loaded.\n\nThe type of play is not included in replay reviews and the umpire crew was unable to see the deflection. Servais argued the call with Libka, then returned to the dugout where he continued to shout at the umps.\n\n\u201cMy temperature and blood boiled really quickly there and the umpires didn\u2019t want any part of making a decision on it,\u201d Servais said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those plays that ultimately you\u2019ve got to get it right.\u201d\n\nDOUBTFUL RETURNS\n\nA day after expressing optimism about his availability, Reds manager David Bell said CF Nick Senzel (shoulder) is not progressing as well as hoped. The two thought Senzel could serve as a runner or hitter in certain situations, even making a deal that there would be no head-first slides. But Senzel said his shoulder hurts when he attempts to hit, as well.\n\n\u201cAnything I\u2019ve been trying to do throwing or hitting, it just hasn\u2019t felt right,\u201d Senzel said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just keep going day by day. That\u2019s really all there is to it.\u201d\n\nWith 16 games left, though, Bell wonders if Senzel and fellow injured players Adam Wood (back) and Jesse Winker (cervical strain) will make it back into the lineup this season.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all unique situations, unique injuries,\u201d Bell said. \u201cBut at this point, when you look at how many games we have left, we don\u2019t\u2019 know if we\u2019re going to get them back or not.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMariners: J.P. Crawford (hamstring) cleared himself to play and the team will soon follow. Manager Scott Servais said the shortstop will likely return to the lineup Thursday or Friday. In the meantime, rookie Donnie Walton got his first major league start at shortstop Wednesday and will back up Crawford the rest of the year.\n\nRookie Jake Fraley\u2019s season is over after an MRI revealed a strained ligament in his right thumb. The centerfielder jammed his thumb in a light collision with teammate Mallex Smith while trying to make a catch Saturday at Houston.\n\nFraley won\u2019t need surgery, but an estimated recovery time of four weeks takes him into the offseason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Servais said. \u201cThis time is really important for these guys. Not so much geared to how they perform or the results, it\u2019s just getting the experience. I feel really bad for him.\u201d\n\nOF/DH Domingo Santana (elbow strain) has been throwing lightly on the side and could return to the lineup as a designated hitter this weekend or on next week\u2019s road trip.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nReds: RHP Tyler Mahle (2-11, 4.94 ERA) takes the mound for his first start against the Mariners and will be seeking his first win since May 31.\n\nMariners: RHP Justin Dunn will be making his major league debut as an opener for Tommy Milone. Dunn is expected to pitch two to three innings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There's not much of a scouting report on Seattle Mariners rookie Kyle Lewis.
