They just are. And for good reason too \u2013 they\u2019re so bloody good. But Fritzenberger in Brissy is taking things to the next level by hosting a \u2013 wait for it \u2013 Halloween Heist Trivia night. HOT DAMN.\n\nAs you can tell by its name, this particular game of trivia is inspired by all of Nine-Nine\u2018s spicy Halloween Heist episodes. Secure your place and maybe, just maybe, you\u2019ll earn a title worthy of a championship cummerbund\u2026 or belt as normal people call it.\n\nYou can register for Fritzenberger\u2019s Halloween Heist trivia sesh at its Petrie Terrace location right here. It\u2019ll take place Friday, November 1. And you can suss out all the details on its Facebook. Better get in quick, mates.\n\nProduction on Nine-Nine\u2018s seventh season kicked off last month. Let us not dwell on Fox\u2019s idiotic, stupid, fucked decision from a number of moons ago. Instead let\u2019s celebrate some good news, like how Saturday Night Live legend Vanessa Bayer is going to be a guest star on season 7.\n\nNine-Nine has had its fair shares of guest stars in the past, including Maya Rudolph, Fred Arminsen, Jenny Slate, and Adam Sandler so of course we should expect no less in season 7.\n\nWe\u2019re not exactly sure who Bayer will star as but if this cheeky piccie Andy Samberg posted is any indication, then I think she\u2019s gonna star as a buddy cop.\n\nSeasons 1 to 5 of Brooklyn Nine-Nine is on Netflix now.", "description": "Fritzenberger in Brissy is taking things to the next level by hosting a - wait for it - Halloween Heist Trivia night.
