He\u2019s not there yet, but he has certainly given Liverpool fans their \u00adbelief back \u2013 and their pride too. I have witnessed that.\n\nI took my lad Jacob on the bus tour around the city with the Champions League \u00adtrophy afterwards. His face after that win was a picture.\n\nIt was a mixture of marvel and joy in what it meant to be a Liverpool fan at that \u00admoment, but also \u00adanticipation about what is still to come. That was the first trophy and we all \u00adbelieve there will be more.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nI went to the party after the final in the team hotel and the joy was on Klopp\u2019s face, too - it was the thing I noticed most about him.\n\nLook, he\u2019s a winner, no doubt, but he also wants to give the people something.\n\nIn that interview, he spoke about a rival manager and the dull football his team played and said he could never do that. He said he would quit \u00adfootball rather than have to play like that.\n\nThat joy I saw on his face says he wants to give the fans something to be proud of.\n\nHe gets what Liverpool is about. He gets what the \u00adpeople of the city are. Most importantly, he gets what it means to people to have that joy in their life.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s not a disciplinarian. That image of him laughing all the time is not true \u2013 I\u2019ve seen him deal with players in the past and he\u2019s as tough as they come. But he has heart, too.\n\nHe does all the tactical stuff, is hugely sophisticated in game plans, science, \u00adanalysis, but his man-\u00admanagement sets him apart.\n\nI\u2019ve been in and around that club and I can see that Klopp is liked by everyone there.\n\n(Image: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nThey see his \u00adpassion, his belief and commitment, and they want to share in it. And the fans see that, too.\n\nI like to think I had the same \u00adrelationship with the fans when I was there, that they understood what it meant for me to play for my hometown club and pull on that shirt.\n\nThat relationship means so much.\n\nMy final game for Liverpool \u2013 at Anfield against Charlton in May 2007 when I was made \u00adcaptain \u2013 was the first and only time I have ever cried on the pitch.\n\nTo have to leave behind that \u00adconnection with those supporters was heartbreaking.\n\nKlopp has it, too.\n\nWhich is why my lad and I believe this is only the start for Liverpool.", "description": "The former Dortmund manager has completely transformed the club since arriving at Anfield in 2015", "authors": ["Robbie Fowler", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images", "Andrew Powell Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20544426.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
