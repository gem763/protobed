She said the show occasionally jumped the shark, or included far-fetched events.\n\n\u201cWhen they did the whole thing with me and Peter Bogdanovich and he did the Jeopardy song. That was, for me, jumping the shark,\u201d Bracco said, referencing the scene where Jennifer\u2019s psychiatrist, Elliot Kupferberg (Peter Bogdanovich), sings the Jeopardy theme song at a dinner party.\n\nIn addition, Bracco said she thought Salvatore \u201cBig Pussy\u201d Bonpensiero\u2019s (Vincent Pastore) was the most \u201cunnecessary\u201d in the show.\n\nBracco also speculated about the characters\u2019 futures. She doesn\u2019t believe Silvio Dante (Steven Van Zandt) survived his coma, that A.J. Soprano (Robert Iler) joined the mafia or that Meadow Soprano (Jamie-Lynn Sigler) married Patrick Parisi (Daniel Sauli).\n\nThe Sopranos co-starred Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Dominic Chianese and Tony Sirico, and aired from 1999 to 2007. Bracco reunited with the cast in January to celebrate the show\u2019s 20th anniversary.\n\nHBO is developing The Many Saints of Newark, a prequel film to The Sopranos. The movie stars Michael Gandolfini, the son of Gandolfini, who died at age 51 in 2013, as a young Tony Soprano.", "description": "Oct. 17 (UPI) \u2014 Lorraine Bracco is sharing her thoughts about The Sopranos.
