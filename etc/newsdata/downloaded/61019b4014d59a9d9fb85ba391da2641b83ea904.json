Even as Trump officials work to repeal federal restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, some oil and gas executives say they have no choice but to press forward with plans to address climate change.\n\nAs world leaders and activists converged in New York City this week for an international climate summit, the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative \u2014 whose members account for 30 percent of global petroleum production \u2014 highlighted their investments in technology to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nLast month, three energy giants \u2014 BP, Exxon and Shell \u2014 said they would continue to cut emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, even though the Environmental Protection Agency announced that the government would no longer require them to do so. The month before, four automakers struck a deal with California pledging to reduce their vehicles\u2019 carbon footprint for the next several years even if the administration eases federal mileage standards.\n\nThe burning of petroleum accounted for 45 percent of the United States\u2019 energy-related carbon emissions last year, according to the Energy Information Administration, while natural gas burning contributed 31 percent.\n\nExtreme climate change has reached the United States\n\nEnergy executives are well aware the U.S. public sees them as partly to blame for the planet\u2019s warming. A recent Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll found 60 percent of U.S. adults said that they support raising taxes on companies that burn fossil fuels, even if that may lead to increased electricity and transportation costs. And the survey found 65 percent of respondents said energy companies were \u201cdoing too little\u201d to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFor years, the oil and gas industry downplayed the connection between fossil fuel burning and climate change, even as some companies \u2014 such as ExxonMobil \u2014 researched their role in heating the planet. Today, however, nearly every major fossil fuel company has acknowledged that carbon emissions help drive global warming even as President Trump questions the connection.\n\nMost oil and gas trade associations argue that expanding natural gas production offers the best path for reducing the United States\u2019 carbon footprint.\n\n\u201cOur position is it\u2019s a very serious issue, that we have an industrial contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, and we\u2019re part of the solution,\u201d said Erik Milito, a vice president at the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group. \u201cThere\u2019s no denial.\u201d\n\nThese groups have pressed to roll back Obama-era rules, however, arguing that they are already doing their part to curb emissions. The IPAA\u2019s members produce 83 percent of the United States\u2019 oil and 90 percent of its natural gas, according to spokesman Jeff Eshelman, and 10 percent of their wells operate on the margins.\n\n\u201cWith burdensome regulation and increased cost, these wells can be at risk, and that\u2019s a significant source of America\u2019s energy supply,\u201d he said.\n\nBut some industry players, who have been whipsawed between policies set by Democratic and Republican administrations, say the more responsible course is to assume that this change in direction may not last.\n\nA handful of factors are driving this shift, according to experts: pressure from shareholders and regulators outside Washington; business calculations; and concern that litigation over federal rules could stretch on for years.\n\n\u201cUnder the Obama administration, there was a recognition by the oil and gas industry that they were facing deaths by a thousand cuts. There was a view that maybe they could make this go away,\u201d said Sarah Ladislaw, who directs the Energy and National Security Program at the Center for International and Strategic Studies. Now, she said, \u201cthey don\u2019t see rolling it back as a durable solution, and therefore they\u2019re having to figure out what a middle-of-the-road solution looks like.\u201d\n\nMike Cantrell, who heads the Oklahoma Energy Producers Alliance, said in an interview that while he opposed several of the regulations adopted under President Barack Obama, Trump\u2019s drive to expand drilling could slash the price of oil and undermine his industry\u2019s standing with the public.\n\n\u201cSometimes getting exactly what you want is the very worst thing you can get,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cRegulation is not our enemy. It is the way we keep faith with the public.\u201d\n\nBehind closed doors \u2014 at venues such as the IPAA\u2019s midyear meeting in Colorado, in a century-old luxury resort \u2014 this tension is visible.\n\nThe three panelists who participated in the June session, dubbed \u201cThe Fight for Legal Ground,\u201d all specialized in energy litigation and embraced the Trump administration\u2019s pro-drilling policies. But two of them cautioned that some of these moves could expose the fossil fuel industry to more lawsuits. And Barron said it was no longer politically tenable for the energy sector to refuse to tackle climate change.\n\nBarron noted that officials at the IPAA, which has represented small and midsize oil and gas firms for 90 years, testified on Capitol Hill in March that they were ready to talk about global warming \u2014 \u201cand we\u2019re going talk about it as us being the solution.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental groups, along with several Democratic attorneys general, have filed more than 100 lawsuits challenging environmental rollbacks under the Trump administration. While many cases are ongoing, most have won favorable rulings. Of 28 cases that have been resolved, according to a tracker by the New York University Law School\u2019s Institute for Policy Integrity, the administration has prevailed only twice.\n\nKathleen C. Schroder, a partner at Davis, Graham & Stubbs, told the audience that advocacy groups are trying to keep fossil fuels in the ground. \u201cI think there\u2019s a very purposeful end to these big challenges,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked about the session, both Schroder and a spokeswoman at Baker Hostetler said it was off-the-record and declined to comment further.\n\nNot every attendee embraced the idea that the industry needs to address global warming. One participant, who did not identify himself on the recording, told Barron he had been \u201cbrainwashed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, catastrophic climate change models don\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to think the industry would sit back and say nothing about that is just incredible.\u201d\n\nTrump administration officials, for their part, say oil and gas companies can always seek to reduce their carbon footprint. In an interview earlier this month, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said that while the agency eased limits on methane emissions from new wells, pipelines and other infrastructure, oil and gas firms could always do more voluntarily.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s so much public interest on climate change, and public interest in reducing emissions, that you\u2019re going to see companies doing more,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the floor, in many cases, on CO2 emissions and greenhouse gases, and we need to do that.\u201d", "description": "Some industry officials wonder whether Trump\u2019s anti-climate agenda has gone too far.", "authors": ["Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9a11j11RxgBHRoZuixGRlhG0R3A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2P5TAAW7UEI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
