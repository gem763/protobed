His integrity and outstanding reporting from the field helped put FOX News on the map and there is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair or elation through his masterful delivery,\u201d Fox News president and executive editor Jay Wallace said in a statement.\n\nSmith was one of Fox News Channel\u2019s original hires in 1996 and has covered nearly every major story for more than two decades.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of the signature reporting and anchoring style he honed at FOX News, along with everything he accomplished here during his monumental 23-year tenure,\u201d Wallace added. \u201cWhile this day is especially difficult, as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecently I asked the company to allow me to leave FOX News and begin a new chapter,\" Smith said in a statement. \"After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged. The opportunities afforded this guy from small-town Mississippi have been many. It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor. I\u2019ve worked with the most talented, dedicated and focused professionals I know and I\u2019m proud to have anchored their work each day -- I will deeply miss them,\u201d\n\nPrior to taking over the breaking news division with the advent of \u201cShepard Smith Reporting,\u201d he anchored \u201cThe FOX Report\u201d and \u201cStudio B,\u201d both of which ranked number one in their respective timeslots.\n\nThe cable news veteran offered an emotional goodbye to viewers as he signed off for the final time, echoing his official statement.\n\n\u201cA personal moment now: gathering and reporting the news has been my life\u2019s work. 33 years, the past 23 right here, since the day we launched Fox News Channel in 1996,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe opportunities afforded this guy from small-town Mississippi have been many. Fox News has allowed me to travel the country and the world, gathering the facts of the day for you. At Columbine, Katrina, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, 9/11, and every life-altering event along the way.\u201d\n\nSmith said he\u2019s met \u201cleaders, heroes, and victims of all stripes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve witnessed and reported on the events that shaped our reality. Together with my colleagues, we\u2019ve written a first draft of history and endeavored to deliver it to you while speaking truth to power without fear or favor, in context and with perspective. I am eternally grateful for the opportunity. For handing me the breaking news reins as Managing Editor, Senior Correspondent, and Chief News Anchor for this network, I am thankful and humbled,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with the most talented, dedicated, and focused professionals I\u2019ve ever known. They sacrifice endlessly and tirelessly to get the news exactly right and I am so proud of them and I\u2019m honored to have anchored their work each day. I\u2019ll miss them and our time together, greatly and deeply.\u201d\n\nSmith continued: \u201cSo recently I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News. After requesting that I stay, they obliged. Under our agreement, I won\u2019t be reporting elsewhere, at least in the near future.\u201d\n\nHe signed off for the final time with a message for viewers.\n\n\u201cEven in our currently polarized nation, it\u2019s my hope that the facts will win the day. That the truth will always matter. That journalism and journalists will thrive,\u201d Smith said.", "description": "Shepard Smith announced Friday that he will step down as Fox News Channel's\u00a0chief news anchor and managing editor of the network's breaking news unit.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
