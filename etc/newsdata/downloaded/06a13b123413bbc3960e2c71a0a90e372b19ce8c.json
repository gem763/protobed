North Jersey Record\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 If you're planning to go to the new American Dream mall's main attraction this weekend, you may be out of luck.\n\nPasses at the mall's Nickelodeon Universe are sold out for Friday, Saturday and Sunday, according to American Dream's website.\n\nOn Friday, only a fraction of the three-million-square-foot mega retail and entertainment center will open \u2014 Nickelodeon Universe Theme Park and American Dream's ice rink. The rest of the property will be opening in phases, later this year and in 2020.\n\nEven if you weren't able to snag a ticket to Nickelodeon Universe for opening weekend before tickets sold out, you can still rent a pair of skates and enjoy the mall's indoor ice rink, according to the North Jersey Record, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nWhat to expect at Nickelodeon Universe\n\nThe theme park has more than 35 rides, roller coasters and attractions. At 8.5 acres, officials say it is the largest indoor theme park in the Western Hemisphere. American Dream has not released a list of rides in the theme park, but they said the property will be home to a handful of record-breaking coasters. Some of the roller-coasters that have been revealed are The Shreddar, The Shellraiser and Nickelodeon's Skyline Scream.\n\nThe Ice Rink will be an NHL-size skating and hockey facility that offers open skating, figure skating, hockey tournaments and other events. .\n\nFor this weekend, operating hours are: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday, and , and Saturday through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.\n\nUnless you managed to snag your entry before tickets for opening weekend sold out, you will have to wait to enjoy the rides inside American Dream's theme park. Even though tickets for opening weekend are sold out, tickets are on sale for slots beginning Monday and extending through Thursday, Nov. 7.\n\nTickets range from $39.99 for general access, recommended for individuals under 48\" or for those who won't be riding the more-thrilling attractions, or $49.99 for all-access, recommended for those taller than 48\" and those who want to enjoy all rides. Children 2 or younger enter free.\n\nThe tickets are also time-slotted: either 10 a.m. through 3 p.m., or 4 p.m. through 9 p.m.\n\n\"The property is not a ticketed property. Only the theme park requires a ticket,\" Dana McHugh, an American Dream spokesperson, said on Tuesday. \"Anyone can go in and explore all the property has to offer.\"\n\nParking will only be free if you keep your trip to American Dream under 30 minutes. Otherwise, you will have to pay to park on the property.\n\nParking rates at American Dream will range from free to $24, depending on the length of your stay, according to the property's website. It's unclear how the paid parking will be handled, however.\n\nThere will be a $10 surcharge for valet parking at American Dream.\n\nWhat happens after this weekend?\n\nAfter this weekend, American Dream hours will be extended.\n\nThe property will be open seven days a week. Weekday hours will be 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Weekend hours are extended to 1 a.m.\n\nEven when the mall's retail section opens next spring, Bergen County's Blue Laws will keep that end of the mall shut on Sundays.\n\nAmerican Dream remains an active construction site, and workers will still be visible on the property after this weekend. In about a month, the mall's next phased opening will be for the property's indoor DreamWorks water park.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2019/10/23/american-dream-nickelodeon-universe-theme-park-1st-weekend-sells-out/4068968002/", "description": "Nickelodeon Universe theme park in New Jersey has 35+ rides and attractions.
