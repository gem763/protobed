The game has proven itself to be an incredibly flexible tool for making clever video game levels that are quite unlike standard Mario designs, but it\u2019s only got a few ways to tinker with mood or tone. That means player CerulanOak has a hell of a job cut out for them when they say they\u2019re going to remake Hollow Knight in Mario Maker. Fortunately, it\u2019s turning out pretty well so far.\n\nSince Hollow Knight is a seamless and sprawling platformer that can\u2019t really be replicated with Mario Maker\u2019s limitations, CerulanOak has taken to making individual levels for each area. They\u2019ve done 4 so far: The Crossroads (Course ID: 0RJ-4WP-LGG), Greenpath (Course ID: L2H-R5G-QYF), the Fungal Wastes (Course ID: G62-5JS-Y2G), and City of Tears (Course ID: 4R5-3Y1-JJF).\n\nThis is actually a very admirable attempt to recreate an important Hollow Knight landmark, you should be impressed.\n\nI like them a lot more than I thought I would! Playing through each, I\u2019m surprised at how well I remember the layout of Hollow Knight, and impressed at how well CerulanOak has been able to approximate it using Mario Maker\u2019s 8-bit set of tools. So far, the levels use the Super Mario Bros. and Mario 3 skins. My favourites are their takes on The Crossroads and City of Tears, moody areas that do better with the original Super Mario\u2019s limited colour palette and more abstract structures.\n\nI particularly loved when I got to their rendition of the City of Tears towers, complete with an approximation of Hollow Knight\u2019s big dramatic windows that seemed to be there solely for brooding.\n\nEach of CerulanOak\u2019s Hollow Knight levels are dense and sprawling, making smart use of tunnels, doors, and dead ends to make them feel like the more exploration-focused spaces of which games like Hollow Knight are full. The translation is a little rough at times\u2014some platforming is a little frustrating, and the way routes through different areas are built mean you\u2019ll have to loop around again if you miss a jump or drop down the wrong platform\u2014but it\u2019s not a huge loss.\n\nThe only things missing are the boss fights\u2014and given how hard some of those are, you\u2019d probably want to take them on as someone other than Mario. Maybe Toad. He could take \u2018em.", "description": "Mario Maker isn\u2019t all that great if you\u2019re craving something moody.
