I don't see the point in taking that risk. It's not even a big loss, to say: 'At your age, 14 and under, you're not heading the ball'. It won't cause any harm or damage to anybody.\u201d\n\nThe Football Association does not currently believe that there is sufficient evidence to make any change to children\u2019s football and has instead reissued guidance on concussion management and limiting heading practice. They also emphasised the wider health benefits of playing football and being active, with the Glasgow study also showing improved heart and lung health, as well as a three-year longer life expectancy.", "description": "Lenny Johnrose, the former Blackburn Rovers, Bury and Burnley midfielder who is now living with motor neurone disease, has called on football to implement a heading ban for Under-14s in an attempt to minimise risks for children.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213923442-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqmhczuFPUvjdRRcnT2XDiV_4qMnjLmhd-5bM5RnyHos.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
