According to the people familiar with the matter, 25 percent of the victims\u2019 windfall would go to paying the class-action lawyers.\n\nThe settlement, expected to be announced in the next month, is an attempt to resolve almost all of the sexual harassment claims against Weinstein\u2014including a class-action suit, a suit filed on behalf of his former employees, and several filed by individual accusers.\n\nAttorneys for two potential holdouts say they\u2019re being bullied to sign the deal by Weinstein\u2019s lawyers and the class-action attorneys.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather used to be in the fruit business in Brooklyn,\u201d Thomas P. Giuffra, an attorney for one of the plaintiffs suing on her own, told The Daily Beast. \u201cGuys would show up offering protection. This feels a lot like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are giving the money that should go to my client to the guy who raped her,\u201d Giuffra added, explaining that if the defense fees are included in the settlement, Weinstein doesn\u2019t have to pay them. \u201cIt takes a cruel and devious mind to come up with such a mean spirited and bullying agreement.\u201d\n\nBeth Fegan, the lead attorney for the class action, denied pressuring the individual plaintiffs to sign the deal and said she had been completely transparent about her fees, which must be approved by the court.\n\n\u201cWe have signed agreements with each of our clients that detail the fee arrangement. We never said we were taking on this case as a pro bono case. As always, we\u2019re abundantly clear about how our work is compensated if we are successful on our clients\u2019 behalf,\u201d Fegan said in a statement.\n\nThe New York State Attorney General\u2019s office said last year that it had reached a deal with investors looking to buy the Weinstein Company that included a victim\u2019s compensation fund of between $80 million and $90 million\u2014but that was before the company declared bankruptcy. Now the proposed settlement is about half that amount, and will be covered entirely by insurance companies.\n\nDouglas Wigdor is representing Weinstein accuser Wedil David, which means he would get a cut of any payout to her. But he noted that Fegan will collect up to 25 percent from every check cut in the class-action case, even to accusers she does not represent, and stands to make millions off the case.\n\nIn December, Fegan told lawyers for the other victims that she would take \u201cno more than 20 percent\u201d in fees for her services. But according to an email reviewed by The Daily Beast, that had swelled to up to 25 percent by this spring.\n\n\u201cIf the matter doesn\u2019t settle as a class, [Fegan] will likely receive a very small fraction of that,\u201d Wigdor said. \u201cShe has every motivation to get this deal done\u2014even if that means agreeing to a settlement that attempts to bind non-participating victims of sexual assault.\u201d\n\nFegan said there was nothing unusual about the lower settlement package or her fees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been negotiating class-action settlements for most of my career and it is always a complex, dynamic process. Our focus is to deliver the best outcome to our clients, whether by judgment or settlement. Both in the class case and in multiple individual cases, the courts have issued a series of adverse rulings dismissing claims against the director defendants,\u201d she said. \u201cYou would expect these adverse rulings, as well as The Weinstein Company bankruptcy, to reduce any available proceeds that may be recoverable at trial or in any settlement.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Fegan\u2019s firm even suggested they would force Wigdor\u2019s client to accept the settlement, using a legal maneuver called a channelling injunction that requires all future claims to be paid out under the same agreement.\n\nGiuffra, who represents Alexandra Canosa, who has accused Weinstein of raping her and sexually abusing her over five years, accused Fegan of \u201chijacking\u201d the negotiations.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s selling out the victims,\u201d Giuffra said, exasperated. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\nFegan denied strong-arming Canosa or David, saying she had never even spoken to the accusers. \u201cIn fact, they have not participated in settlement negotiations over the last six months by their lawyers\u2019 choice, and have the right to continue prosecuting their individual cases,\u201d she said in an email to The Daily Beast.\n\nThe judge in Fegan\u2019s case, Alvin Hellerstein, dramatically scaled back the scope of the suit in April, dropping 17 of the claims to eliminate all defendants except Weinstein. The Weinstein Company also filed for bankruptcy in March, after a potential sale collapsed. Fegan said both events reduced the amount of money available to victims through trial or settlement.\n\nWigdor and Giuffra said they also felt backed into a corner by Weinstein\u2019s attorneys, who they claim have refused to hand over crucial documents. Giuffra said Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney, Elior Shiloh, is currently attempting to subpoena his client\u2019s father, who lives in England, and her husband, whom she did not know at the time of the alleged assault.\n\nIn an email to victims\u2019 attorneys last spring, Shiloh warned there was \u201ca tiny window\u201d in which to settle and that \u201caction would have to be taken ASAP\u201d\u2014a message the attorneys viewed as a threat. A month later, he was in their inboxes again, warning, \u201cEveryday that goes by the insurers lose interest.\u201d\n\nShiloh did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe settlement would also affect the case of actress Ashley Judd, who sued Weinstein in April for allegedly spreading lies about her after she rebuffed his advances. Judd and her lawyers have had no part in the class-action negotiations, but language included in the agreement would release Weinstein\u2019s insurers from covering any of the actress\u2019 claims.\n\n\u201cAshley Judd\u2019s case against Harvey Weinstein is ongoing and we intend to bring it to trial and vindicate her rights in open court,\u201d Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., the lead lawyer representing Judd, told The Daily Beast. \u201cShe is not and never has been part of any settlement.\u201d\n\nActress Rose McGowan, one of the first people to publicly accuse Weinstein of sexual assault, also filed a case against him this week. The suit accuses Weinstein and his attorneys, David Boies and Lisa Bloom, of conspiring to silence her and discredit her sexual assault claims. It is unclear if the settlement will affect her case.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s criminal trial is set to get underway in January. He faces two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of criminal sexual act and two counts of rape. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex.\n\nWigdor and his client plan on protesting the settlement and proceeding with their suit against Weinstein. \u201cI\u2019m very upset that all of these parties, including the AG\u2019s office, would turn a blind eye to this,\u201d he said.", "description": "Some women say they\u2019re being strong-armed into taking a lousy deal.", "authors": ["Lachlan Cartwright", "Emily Shugerman", "Senior Reporter", "Gender Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571972823/191024-Lachlan-Shugerman-Weinstein-tease_gfr92k", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
