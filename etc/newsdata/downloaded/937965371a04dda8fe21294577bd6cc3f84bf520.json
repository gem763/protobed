This federal relay ends when HHS officials pass the UACs to volunteer \u201csponsors\u201d in the United States who are usually the parents and relatives who paid the smugglers.\n\nStaffers and legislators in Congress created this huge UAC pipeline in 2008 via unanimous votes in the House and the Senate. The loophole was quickly spotted by pro-migration lawyers and promptly exploited by allied cartels and coyotes.\n\nThe numbers quickly climbed from roughly 8,000 per year to 13,600 in 2012, 39,000 in fiscal 2013, 69,000 in 2914, 40,000 in 2015, 60,000 in 2016, 41,000 in 2017, and 50,000 in 2018. Almost 73,000 UACs walked across the border in 2019.\n\nCongress\u2019s careless and unanimous vote for the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 has delivered more than one-third of a million \u2014 or 386,000 \u2014 \u201cunaccompanied\u201d youths to American schools and rental apartments, and some, to the nation\u2019s jails as MS-13 members.\n\nThe federal cooperation in this cartel-backed youth-smuggling pipeline has been an open secret for at least six years. GOP legislators openly acknowledge the federal role in the trafficking system, while Democrats each year fight to get spending rules that bar enforcement officials from using HHS data to reveal the illegal migrants who import their children as UACs.\n\nTrump's citizenship dir. Ken Cuccinelli wants to fix an open secret in DC: The US Gov't cooperates with coyotes & cartels to import 200K+ children of illegal migrants from Central America. Naturally, the establishment media conceals this elite philanthropy https://t.co/P4HJ9HHVnv \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 23, 2019\n\nMany UACs do not file for asylum, but few of the UAC asylum applicants have been sent home.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, almost 91,000 UAC asylum cases are pending. Only 331 have been allowed to stay, and 7,500 were ordered home by the third quarter of 2019. But nearly 5,600 of the 7,500 rejected applicants \u2014 or 75 percent \u2014 skipped their court decisions to hide among the nation\u2019s growing population of illegal aliens.\n\nMany UACs try to get legal status by using the Special Immigrant Juvenile Status loophole in the 2008 law. Officials at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service have tried to narrow this loophole but are being delayed by pro-migration lawyers.\n\nDemocrats \u2014 such as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker \u2014 have tried to accelerate the award of the SIJS status by state judges, some of whom are pro-migrant. In September 2019, KUOW.org reported from Seattle, Washington:\n\nJudge [Maf\u00e9] Rajul, who offers teddy bears, says that while the history of each of these children is harrowing, she tries to find a way to connect with them when they\u2019re in her courtroom. An immigrant from Colombia herself, Rajul reckons with the fact that her decisions impact migrant children and their path towards a legal, permanent status. \u201cI always want to have them walk away with a positive experience,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I always offer them a teddy bear or ask them about their school, what they like \u2026 just a way to make them feel not as scared.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Americans deal with the resulting wave of migrants and the growing number of illegal aliens, most of whom will gladly work in low-wage jobs that would otherwise be automated or performed by better-paid Americans.\n\nFor example, in Worthington, MN, \u201cmore than 400 unaccompanied minors have been placed in Nobles County [over six years] \u2014 the second most per capita in the country,\u201d says a report in the Washington Post. The report merely noted that the town\u2019s meatpacking industry employs migrants but declined to connect those migrants to the inflow of youths:\n\nTheir arrival has helped swell Worthington\u2019s student population by almost one-third, forcing administrators to convert storage space into classrooms and teachers to sprint between periods, book carts in tow. \u2026 School districts don\u2019t track immigration status but they do keep tabs on English language learners (ELL), who are generally more difficult and costly to educate. The number of ELL students in Worthington has nearly doubled since 2013, to 35 percent of students. In the high school, where most unaccompanied minors are placed, it has almost tripled. \u201cThey arrive every day, all year long,\u201d said Julie Edenborough, director of migrant services for Guymon Public Schools in Texas County, Okla., the only place to receive more unaccompanied minors per capita than Nobles County. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about kids who couldn\u2019t write their own name, who couldn\u2019t hold a pencil.\u201d\n\nThe Post declined to describe the harm to young Americans at the local high school. But the school ratings sites say the test scores by the school\u2019s college-bound kids have dropped below the level of nearby Minnesota schools. \u201cWorthington Senior High is ranked 248th within Minnesota,\u201d says USNews.com. \u201cThe AP\u00ae participation rate at Worthington Senior High is 22% \u2026 [and] 60% of students are economically disadvantaged.\u201d The school\u2019s college-bound students now rate at just a 53.7 percent score.\n\nSome of the UACs are imported for cheap labor. The Post said:\n\nOne 17-year-old asylum seeker from Guatemala said he cleaned a meatpacking plant by night, attended class by day and milked cows in the afternoon before grabbing a few hours of sleep. But he could never fully repay the Worthington relative with whom he was living. Now 18, he\u2019s dropped out of school, moved to another state and works construction. His asylum hearing is scheduled for March in Minneapolis but he fears he won\u2019t have the money to attend, forfeiting his already uphill battle for asylum.\n\nMany progressives praise the cartel-tied UAC pipeline amid the plentiful evidence of the cartels\u2019 role and the impact on Americans. For example, Buzzfeed\u2019s report hid the scale of the migration, downplayed the parents\u2019 role, and suggested the Central American youths and children are traveling through Mexico on their own:\n\nIf enacted, the change could represent the latest attempt by the Trump administration to try to deter unaccompanied children from coming to the country and applying for asylum \u2026 by children who arrived in the country without a guardian.\n\nImmigration Numbers:\n\nEach year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics. But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers \u2014 including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses \u2014 and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners, and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants. This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions. The federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children\u2019s schools and college educations.\n\nThe cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.\n\nThe labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.\n\nBut President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy. The Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings increase of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, to bring their median wages to $45,097 for full time, year-round work.", "description": "Agency officials drafted a plan to accelerate the review of asylum claims by migrant children and youths who claim to be \"unaccompanied.\"", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1065354234-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
