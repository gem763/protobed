The index made a lifetime high of 12103.05 in the month of June 2019. The high was backed by enthusiasm over the overwhelming majority to the incumbent Government. However, the high did not sustain and Nifty ended the month in the red zone. Subsequent months of July and August 2019 witnessed heavy selling by FPIs owing to the introduction of excess surcharge over capital gains made by FPIs. Despite the Finance Minister waiving off the surcharge in the month of August, the index remains in a consolidation zone. September 2019 is the fourth ongoing month where the index remains in red on a monthly time frame.\n\nFactors affecting the sentiment:\n\nDomestic growth concerns: The GDP numbers reported for the quarter ending June 2019 have disappointed investors, to say the least. The growth figures came in at 5.0% which was much lower than the consensus estimate of 5.8%. The numbers aggravate slowdown fears in the economy and have caused scare in the markets.\n\nThe GDP numbers reported for the quarter ending June 2019 have disappointed investors, to say the least.

Global economic factors: Slowing growth across the globe is weighing on the sentiment for the domestic markets. Globally, bonds to the tune of USD 17 trillion are in the negative yield territory. The US yield curve spread (2 years - 10 years) remains close to zero and the inverted yield curve is an indication of recessionary times ahead.\n\nSlowing growth across the globe is weighing on the sentiment for the domestic markets.

Bleak Earnings Outlook: The Earnings Per Share for has been flat for almost 5 years now. Investors have been patient and hoping for earnings recovery. The flat EPS for a prolonged period is testing investor patience.\n\nTechnical outlook:\n\nOn the daily charts, the index has shown resistance at the 200-day moving average. On weekly charts, support of 100 weeks moving average remains intact but is shaky. On monthly charts, this is the fourth month that the index stays in negative territory. On all important timeframe, the index remains in a crucial territory.\n\nWhat should investors do:\n\nThere are plenty of opinions about the current state of the market. On one end of the spectrum, the current territory looks like a value zone for long term investments. On the other end, fear is unprecedented compared to recent times. Capital conservation is a priority for all serious investors and catching a falling knife may simply keep hurting. The third school of thought is taking the middle ground. Keep investing small amounts at regular intervals. Such periodic investments give an advantage of time-based averaging. All those retail investors have in hand is being disciplined about investments and keep investing periodically in quality stocks. It is advisable to take decisions after consulting your financial advisor.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Tequity Investing covering: Nifty 50.
