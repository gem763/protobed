YouTube/Catholic High Alumni\n\nAs leader of one of the world\u2019s strongest nations, there\u2019s probably not a lot of things that can intimidate Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\n\nBut the premier joked on Wednesday (Oct 16) that he was \u201cstunned and terrified\u201d when he was approached to sing a song on video \u2013 and not just any song, but one which he learned and sang daily as a young schoolboy in Singapore\u2019s early years.\n\n\u201cI was pleasantly surprised (actually stunned and terrified :)) when they asked me to join other Catholic High alumni to sing the school song for their anniversary video,\u201d PM Lee wrote on Facebook.\n\n\u201cIt has been years since I attended morning assembly, and I still remember the words, though I was never a very good singer!\u201d he added.\n\nThe Prime Minister received secondary education and graduated from Catholic High School in 1969 when he was 17 years old. Despite the 50-year gap, the PM said in his post that he still remembered the lyrics to the school anthem.\n\nTwo years after his graduation, Lee was awarded the President\u2019s Scholarship and Singapore Armed Forces Overseas Scholarship to study mathematics at Cambridge University\u2019s Trinity College.\n\nThe video, which was published on Sunday, was directed by alumnus Chai Yee Wei, and showcases various men from the Catholic High Alumni association, including the PM\u2019s former principal, Brother Joseph Dufresse Chang, and former president of the alumni, Song Chwee Him, who is over 90 years old.\n\nOther former schoolboys who join the PM in singing the school song include songwriter Liang Wern Fook, former MP Chan Soo Sen, retired judge Justice Chao Hick Tin and many others.\n\nDespite the PM\u2019s initial reaction to the alumni association\u2019s invitation, many commenters on Facebook have lauded the PM\u2019s effort.\n\nA Facebook user who identified himself as the composer of the video said the PM \u201cdid great singing the school song\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s about singing from the heart, and you did just that!\u201d he said.\n\nYou can watch the full video here:\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - It's been 50 years, but he still remembers the words!.
