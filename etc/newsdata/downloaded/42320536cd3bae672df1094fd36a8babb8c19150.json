Scherzer was slated to start Sunday's World Series game, has been scratched with spasms in his neck and right trapezius.\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 This is Max Scherzer\u2019s shot.\n\nHurting so much over the weekend that it seemed his season might be over, Mad Max instead gets the ball for a final time \u2014 in Game 7 of the World Series.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you live for,\u201d the Washington Nationals ace said.\n\nBaseball fans, same thing.\n\nA matchup devoid of late-inning drama that\u2019s threatening to set a record low for television ratings has suddenly turned into must-see TV.\n\n\u201cMaybe not how we drew it up in terms of how we got there, but it doesn\u2019t take away the opportunity we have to win the World Series,\u201d Houston Astros manager AJ Hinch said.\n\nZack Greinke, acquired by Houston in late July for exactly these situations, starts Wednesday night for the Astros.\n\n\u201cA little excited about it at the moment, but we\u2019ll see,\u201d Greinke said.\n\nThe wild-card Nationals, trying to rewrite franchise history with their first championship. The 107-win Astros, aiming to build a legacy by taking their second crown in three years.\n\nA pair of teams that began spring training under sunny skies in February, working out side-by-side in the complex they share in Florida, now meeting in late October under the retractable roof at Minute Maid Park for the biggest prize of all.\n\nSo what to expect from Scherzer?\n\nUnable to pitch Game 5 on Sunday night because of nerve irritation near his neck that required an injection, the three-time Cy Young Award winner is set to start this all-or-nothing showdown.\n\n\u201cThe cortisone shot worked. That relieved the pressure on the nerve,\u201d Scherzer said.\n\n\u201cEverybody has the belief in me and the doctors that I could get right and be ready,\u201d he said.\n\nScherzer tossed in the outfield before Game 6 \u2014 a 7-2 win by the Nationals \u2014 and even loosened up in the bullpen in the seventh inning Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cMax is starting tomorrow,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cWe got him up knowing that if the game is tied or we were up a run we might have to use him. He wanted to go down there and just throw and get loose. We scored some more runs and I immediately shut him down.\u201d\n\nWhether the Game 1 winner, known for his incredible intensity, will be able to cut loose at full force, we\u2019ll soon see.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s healthy or not. We\u2019re going to find out in the first inning,\u201d Astros star Carlos Correa said.\n\nIf Scherzer returns and wins, it might well go down in sports lore, along with Curt Schilling\u2019s bloody sock, Kirk Gibson hobbling around the bases and the night Willis Reed limped back on the court at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d probably make a movie about it. I bet, if he could, he could come back from the dead,\u201d teammate Adam Eaton said.\n\nThe Nationals rallied to extend the only World Series where the road team has taken the six first games. So much for the home-field advantage.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like there is one right now, but I hope there\u2019s one tomorrow. We\u2019re waiting until the last game to have it on our side,\u201d Hinch said.\n\nEveryone available, probably.\n\nAstros ace Gerrit Cole, certainly. And maybe Justin Verlander after going five innings Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Game 7, all hands on deck. If AJ asks, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll figure out a way,\u201d Verlander said.\n\nHouston played in the previous Game 7 of the World Series, when George Springer and crew hammered Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium in 2017.\n\nRoad teams took the two prior Game 7s, too \u2014 Joe Maddon\u2019s Cubs at Cleveland in 2016 and Madison Bumgarner and the Giants at Kansas City in 2014.\n\nGreinke gave up one run over 4 2/3 innings in his first World Series start when the Astros took Game 3. Acquired from Arizona at the trade deadline, the six-time All-Star is 0-2 with a 5.30 ERA in four starts this postseason.\n\nScherzer is 3-0 with a 2.16 ERA this postseason in four starts and one relief appearance.\n\n\u201cFor the people that followed this team the whole season, it had to be this way,\u201d Nationals reliever Sean Doolittle said. \u201cIt was going to be this way. We\u2019ve had a knack for kind of making things a little tougher than we needed to at times and drawing things out. We got off to the slow start but it just feels like it\u2019s the most 2019 Nats thing for this to come down to Game 7 in the World Series.\u201d", "description": "Max Scherzer gets the ball for a final time \u2014 in Game 7 of the World Series.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU281_scherz_ZG_20191030053740.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
