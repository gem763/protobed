The government has consistently stated that the crisis must be solved through a stable political solution which enshrines the rights of all Syrians, including the Kurdish people,\u201d it concluded.\n\nThe KRG appealed to Russia, which intervened with military force in Syria to protect the regime of dictator Bashar Assad, to act in defense of the Syrian Kurds. The Russians have indicated a willingness to mediate in the conflict, but have not taken direct action to halt the Turkish invasion.\n\n\u201cWe call on the international community, including the U.S., Russia, UK, and France, to put their utmost efforts to end this undesired situation, prevent future destabilization, and bring about an atmosphere for negotiations,\u201d the Iraqi Kurdish parliament said on Thursday, reminding the international community of the sacrifices made by Kurds while fighting the Islamic State.\n\nThe parliament said it strongly condemns \u201cevery attack which targets civilians by any sides\u201d and supports \u201cregional dialogue for a durable resolution.\u201d\n\nThe Iraqi Kurds notably included some criticism of Syrian Kurds in these statements, as when condemning attacks against civilians by \u201cany sides\u201d and urging Kurdish parties to help \u201cde-escalate the situation.\u201d The KRG parliamentary statement acknowledged the Kurds are divided into factions that have long-standing disputes with each other.\n\nKRG officials have been in communication with members of the U.S. Congress this week, urging them to convince President Donald Trump to change his mind and do what he can to push the Turks out of Syria.\n\n\u201cEleven civilians have been killed and five injured as a result of this,\u201d said one such communique sent after the Turkish operation began. \u201cSyrian Kurds simply have no place to go as this is their ancestral homeland. For the Kurds, it is a matter of life and death. They will be forced to defend themselves, diverting resources from the maximum campaign pressure against ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a disaster in the making. Therefore, it is in the best interest of all parties to prevent this from taking place while there is still time, and Washington is the only player in this equation that could stop this disaster in the making,\u201d the Iraqi Kurdish letter to Congress said.\n\nThe KRG\u2019s representative in London, Karwan Jamal Tahir, told Newsweek on Wednesday that a Turkish attack on the Syrian Kurds has long been anticipated, and his government took President Trump seriously when he said last December that he wanted to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. He said Trump\u2019s sudden withdrawal of troops from the area this week sent a \u201cvery clear green light\u201d message to Turkey that it could proceed with its attack.\n\nTahrir said the Iraqi Kurdish government is deeply concerned about the prospect of Turkey driving another flood of refugees into its territory. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can bear more refugees from Syria,\u201d he said, while acknowledging there were few realistic alternatives for Syrian Kurds fleeing the Turkish onslaught.\n\n\u201cThe people cannot bear anymore crisis in that area, and there should be a talk between the government \u2013 especially the Turkish government, Russia, even the Syrian government,\u201d Tahir urged, emphasizing that the Kurds \u201ccannot be left out\u201d of discussions over Syria\u2019s future.", "description": "Iraqi Kurds denounce the Turkish invasion of Syria and worry about a flood of refugees pouring into their territory.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/wi/afp/07/87c492_rights-groups-regularly-criticised-erosion-free-speech-in-turkey-president-e1566339343675-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
