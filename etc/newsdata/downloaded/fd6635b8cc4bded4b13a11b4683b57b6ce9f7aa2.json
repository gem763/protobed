And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government,\u201d he said, according to the leaked audio.\n\nWarren, who in March called for breaking up Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc, quickly issued a retort on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights,\u201d Warren tweeted.\n\nIn a later series of tweets, Warren noted that Facebook has built more market dominance in recent years by acquiring potential competitors WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\n\u201cMore than 85% of all social networking traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Facebook,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of power\u2014and face little competition or accountability.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, undermined our democracy, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\u201d\n\nIn the audio, Zuckerberg said breaking up big tech companies would make election interference \u201cmore likely because now the companies can\u2019t coordinate and work together.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg also drew laughter by saying Facebook\u2019s investment on safety is bigger than Twitter\u2019s entire revenue.\n\nRelated Coverage Factbox: Six things Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff in leaked audio\n\nZuckerberg issued a statement on his Facebook page, linking to The Verge\u2019s transcript, though he said it was meant to be internal.\n\n\u201cYou can check it out if you\u2019re interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I\u2019m thinking and telling employees\u201d he wrote in the post.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has an open antitrust investigation into Facebook, and a group of state attorneys general led by New York is also investigating.\n\nOther Democratic presidential candidates have also criticized Facebook. Senator Bernie Sanders said he would look to split up Facebook, Google and Amazon, while Senator Kamala Harris said a break-up should \u201cseriously\u201d be considered.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, one of the lawmakers who introduced the Honest Ads Act that would force Facebook to disclose purchasers of ads on the platform, announced her campaign with a speech that criticized major tech companies.\n\nAnother senior Facebook executive told Reuters this month the company is confident it would defeat an effort to break it up.\n\nWith more than 2 billion monthly users, Facebook been under scrutiny from regulators around the world over data sharing practices. It has also come under fire for failing to prevent Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and other Republicans have criticized social media platforms for alleged bias against conservatives, which the platforms have denied.\n\nZuckerberg was on Capitol Hill last month for the first time since he testified before the U.S. Congress in April 2018. While in Washington he met with Trump and members of congress.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing regarding the company\u2019s use and protection of user data on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 11, 2018.
