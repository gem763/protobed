The most obsessively collected examples tend to have one thing in common - they were originally marketed at boys.\n\nWhile these toys aren't collected exclusively by men, women are less likely to have vast collections of them. So which vintage toys are women seeking out?\n\nBlythe\n\nImage copyright Laura Kate Shippert Image caption Blythe pondered on the mysteries of Stonehenge during her visit to the famous stone circle\n\nThanks to her peculiarly oversized head and bulging eyes that change colour with the pull of a string, not many girls wanted to play with Blythe when she was introduced in 1972.\n\nBut Blythe has become strangely popular in recent years and original dolls now sell for between \u00a3500 and \u00a32,000, depending on their condition.\n\n\"They were only released for a year,\" says Laura Kate Shippert, one of the organisers of BlytheCon UK, which was held in Bristol earlier this month. \"They failed terribly; people thought they were a bit freaky and scary.\"\n\nImage copyright Laura Kate Shippert Image caption This Blythe doll was lucky enough to see Notre-Dame before the devastating fire\n\nTheir popularity in recent years was sparked by a book called This is Blythe, in which photographer Gina Garan featured the dolls artfully posed like real fashion models. Others then started picking up second-hand Blythe dolls - which were relatively cheap at the time - dressing them in glamorous outfits and photographing them in exotic locations.\n\nThe renewed interest has led to new Blythe dolls being produced, known in the community as \"Neo Blythes\" - and these are pretty valuable too.\n\n\"They are anywhere from \u00a3100 to \u00a3400 new, then after a while some become more popular and harder to find, and the prices will fluctuate,\" says Laura Kate.\n\nShe has 17 Blythe dolls, but only one is an original from 1972. She paid \u00a3400 for it about 10 years ago, which was \"a steal\" even at the time.\n\nImage copyright Laura Kate Shippert Image caption This Blythe opted for a classic tourist pose in front of the Eiffel Tower\n\nLaura Kate considers her own collection to be quite small compared to other people's.\n\n\"I know someone who owns like 40 of them and I think 'but you could own a house',\" she says. \"If that's what makes her happy and that's what she wants to spend her money on, she's an adult, she can make her choices. It's not cocaine.\"\n\nMy Little Pony\n\nImage copyright Martina Foster Image caption Martina Foster (right) is known in the pony community as Sparkler, her favourite My Little Pony\n\nThe My Little Pony phenomenon began when the toys were launched in 1982. About 150 million ponies were reportedly sold in the 1980s, with their popularity boosted by an animated TV series. Actor Danny DeVito even lent his voice to the 1986 film My Little Pony: The Movie.\n\nMartina Foster loves My Little Pony so much she has a \"pony room\" in her house filled with somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 of them, worth between \u00a310,000 and \u00a315,000.\n\nMartina was seven years old when she was given her first one - a pony called Tootsie printed with lollipop \"cutie marks\". She rediscovered them while searching eBay as a student, then got her old ones out of the loft.\n\nImage copyright Martina Foster Image caption These two ponies enjoyed prancing in the sun on a day out at the river\n\nImage copyright Martina Foster Image caption Dressing up as a pony is encouraged at UK PonyCon, but attendees are not permitted to wear real metal horseshoes\n\n\"I thought, 'I'll buy the ones that I always wanted, just for fun',\" she says. \"Then you get sucked into it.\"\n\nMartina says the market fluctuates but rare ones in good condition can now fetch thousands of pounds. The most she has spent is a \u00a3200 for a pony called Rapunzel - \"a bargain\" because it is now worth about \u00a3500.\n\nMartina is vice chairman of this year's UK PonyCon, which is being held in Nottingham this weekend. As well as attracting collectors of the original toys, the convention attracts fans of the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic animated series, which launched in 2010.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption My Little Pony was originally launched in 1982 by Hasbro and has been revived three times since then\n\nWhile My Little Pony was marketed towards girls in the 1980s, many fans of the animated series are adult men.\n\n\"It is fairly watchable even for grown-ups,\" says Martina. \"You can watch it as an adult and there are some witty things in it and in the end it's all about friendship and accepting other people.\"\n\nPippa\n\nImage copyright Heather Swann Image caption Heather Swann photographs her dolls and posts photos online\n\nPippa was marketed as \"the pocket money fashion doll\" when she was sold in the 1970s, but Vectis Auctions has sold Pippa dolls for as much as \u00a31,400 in recent years. She and her friends are much shorter than normal fashion dolls at only 6.5 inches (16.5cm) tall, which meant production costs were low.\n\nHeather Swann started collecting them about 20 years ago after picking one up in a charity shop for 50p. She wanted to collect them as a way of recapturing her childhood.\n\n\"Isn't that why people collect toys?\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Heather Swann Image caption Heather has about 50 Pippa dolls, made by Leicestershire toymaker Palitoy\n\nAfter Heather's charity shop find she started buying more dolls through eBay.\n\n\"They were much cheaper then, as ladies of a certain age were just beginning to find them,\" she says. \"Unfortunately they are now becoming expensive and many collectors are after them.\"\n\nImage copyright Heather Swann Image caption Heather says Pippa dolls are becoming more expensive\n\nHeather describes her collection of about 50 dolls as \"medium size\", as many women have hundreds. She has seen individual dolls sell for hundreds of pounds but the most she has ever spent is \u00a340.\n\n\"I don't tend to buy the expensive dolls, I now just look out for the ones which need a transformation,\" she says. \"I enjoy the process of restoring them.\"\n\nCare Bears\n\nImage copyright Jennifer Hawkins Image caption Jennifer Hawkins's 200 Care Bears take up so much space in her house she bought a bunk-bed for them\n\nCare Bears were originally painted in 1981 to appear on greetings cards, before the characters were turned into soft toys in 1983. A television series followed, as did books, a plethora of merchandise, multiple LPs and a film in 1985 for which Carole King was persuaded to write and perform songs for the soundtrack.\n\nJennifer Hawkins loves Care Bears so much she had her favourite one, Bedtime Bear, tattooed on her arm.\n\n\"I was looking around earlier and I think I've got something Care Bears-related in every room, except my bathroom,\" says Jennifer, who lives in Gloucester with about 200 Care Bears.\n\n\"But they make me happy so I'm quite happy to have them everywhere. I like the cuteness, I like having the little faces to talk to, I like the fact that they represent different feelings.\"\n\nImage copyright Jennifer Hawkins Image caption Jennifer spent \u00a3140 on this 25th anniversary edition of Bedtime Bear\n\nJennifer got one of her favourites - called Beanie - \"as a comfort\" when her grandfather died the day after her 14th birthday.\n\n\"He [Beanie] comes pretty much everywhere with me now,\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Jennifer Hawkins Image caption Jennifer had a tattoo of Bedtime Bear sitting on a cloud\n\nShe estimates her collection is worth \"a few thousand\". The most she spent on an individual bear was \u00a3140, which was a 25th anniversary version of Bedtime Bear, and resisted the temptation to spend \u00a3500 on an original 1980s Bedtime Bear that was still in the box.\n\n\"Unfortunately I can't afford to spend a month's rent on one bear,\" she says. \"That's definitely a bit too much.\"\n\nBarbie and Sindy\n\nBarbie was launched in 1959 and swiftly became a cultural icon, gathering fans among each new generation of girls.\n\nLinda Richardson was not one of them. When her mother gave her Barbies, she chopped their heads off.\n\nImage copyright Linda Richardson Image caption Most of Linda's dolls are NRFB - \"never removed from box\"\n\n\"My passion was always cowboys and Indians and motorbikes and all that stuff,\" says Linda, who lives in Cumbria. But she now has an \"obsession\" with dolls and has more than 500, worth about \u00a335,000 at a \"conservative estimate\".\n\nHer passion was ignited 15 years ago on a trip to buy presents for her son.\n\n\"I saw these Native American Indians and they happened to be Barbies and that just set it off, really,\" she says.\n\nShe did not buy the dolls at the time but started researching Barbie online and \"found a whole new world\".\n\nMost of the ones she buys are aimed at collectors, rather than the typical Barbie dolls made for children. She keeps them protected behind glass doors in a room lined with bookcases.\n\nImage copyright Linda Richardson Image caption Linda photographs some of her dolls and puts them on Instagram\n\nImage copyright Linda Richardson Image caption These Native American dolls ignited Linda's interest in Barbie\n\nShe also has some \"de-boxed\" dolls she puts in dioramas, photographs and posts on Instagram. \"It's just something to do,\" she says. \"It keeps me out of trouble.\"\n\nOthers favour Barbie's rival, which went on to become the best-selling fashion doll in the UK when it launched in 1963.\n\nMelanie Quint only had one Sindy as a child but now has 60 or 70, worth between three and four thousand pounds.\n\n\"I decided to sell all of my childhood dolls and when I looked on eBay I realised there was this massive collecting and restoration community,\" she says.\n\nInstead of selling her dolls she ended up buying more.\n\n\"It's nostalgia at the end of the day,\" says Melanie. \"You look at the face and the doll and the fashions and it takes you back to the way you were when you were a child.\"\n\nImage copyright Melanie Quint Image caption Melanie Quint owns dozens of Sindy dolls\n\nImage copyright Melanie Quint Image caption Melanie Quint has 60 or 70 Sindy dolls\n\nMelanie now runs Dollycon UK, which is for collectors of all dolls but has a particular focus on Sindy. A particular highlight is the \"hilarious\" cosplay competition, where people dress up as particular dolls.\n\n\"It's very tongue-in-cheek,\" says Melanie. \"They pick some of the weird outfits, the 70s stuff. It's really funny seeing what they do.\n\n\"We had one woman last year who dressed as Action Man Frogman, in a full suit with flippers on. I couldn't speak, it was hilarious.\"\n\nImage copyright DollyCon UK Image caption The DollyCon cosplay competition is \"very tongue-in-cheek\"\n\nYou might also be interested in:", "description": "Which vintage toys - some worth thousands of pounds - are women seeking out?
