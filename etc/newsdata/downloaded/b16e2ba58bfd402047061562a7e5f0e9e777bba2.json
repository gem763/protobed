Additionally, those living with major life challenges and traumas might be less incentivised to be physically active.\n\n\u201cPsychological experiences also play a big role,\u201d the report continues. \u201cUp to half of adults attending specialist obesity services have experienced childhood adversity.\u201d\n\nThe report touches on \u201cemotional eating\u201d and says that those who diet frequently may be more inclined to overeat when they are feeling particularly vulnerable.\n\nAngel Chater, a chartered psychologist at the University of Bedfordshire and one of the report\u2019s authors, said: \u201cAdult obesity levels in England increased by 18 per cent between 2005 and 2017, and there were similar increases in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be explained by a sudden loss of motivation across the four nations of the UK. The increase in obesity can, in part, be attributed to changes in the food supply and physical activity environment.\u201d\n\nTo address the problem, Dr Chater says we need to understand how weight management and behaviour changes for obesity prevention are informed by psychology.\n\nSarb Bajwa, chief executive of the BPS, said the government should tackle the issue of obesity in a similar manner to smoking.\n\n\u201cIt has taken action at all levels for decades, from government policy to helping individual smokers, but we are now seeing significant reductions in the level of smoking and the health problems it causes,\u201d Mr Bajwa pointed out.\n\n\u201cPsychologists have the science and clinical experience to help the health service do the same for obesity.\n\n\u201cWe can help, not just by devising ways of helping individuals, but also by advising on public policy that will help create an environment in which people find it easier not to become obese in the first place.\u201d", "description": "Obesity is \u201cnot a choice\u201d, states a new report from the British Psychological Society (BPS) that calls for changes in how people regard those who are obese.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/15/istock-1133802328.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
