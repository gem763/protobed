Their latest undertaking, however, is considerably more hardcore.\n\nIn spring next year, the company\u2019s trusty ship, the Naumon (Worldship), will begin a tour of Spanish ports to commemorate the first circumnavigation of the world and to warn of the need for action on the climate emergency.\n\nAided by a rigid but foldable high-tech sail, it will then crisscross the world, spreading its message from sea to sea and port to port.\n\nCarlus Padrissa, one of the founders of La Fura dels Baus \u2013 \u201cand also slightly the captain of this project\u201d \u2013 sees the 1519-22 circumnavigation as one of the greatest achievements of European, and indeed human, history.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s on a par with reaching the moon or going to Mars,\u201d he says. \u201cOf the 270 who set out, only 18 made it back. This was the time when man came out of the darkness of the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance.\n\n\u201cThis is when people all over the world began to interact. The idea is to put on a show to say to people: \u2018Look, we\u2019re all on the same planet \u2013 we\u2019re all in the same boat \u2013 so why don\u2019t we try rowing in the same direction?\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Norwegian ice-breaker The Naumon will be fitted with a high-tech sail to reduce the environmental impact of the tour. Photograph: La Fura dels Baus\n\nThe Naumon, which has been bobbing on the freshwaters of the Rhine for the past decade, is being fixed up in a Santander shipyard.\n\nOnce the eight metre by 20 metre sail, designed by Bound4Blue , has been fitted, sea tests will begin and the team hopes the ship will make its first call in Seville early next year.\n\nMembers of the theatre company will be joined by scientists from Spain\u2019s National Research Council, who will monitor the sail\u2019s performance and conduct experiments.\n\n\u201cIn September, we\u2019ll head for Hamburg,\u201d says Padrissa. \u201cAfter that, we\u2019ll go wherever they call us.\u201d\n\nPadrissa points out that the Naumon, which was built in Norway in 1964, is one of countless polluting vessels in need of a cleaner means of propulsion.\n\n\u201cWe have to put a new sail on. The idea is to recycle and to show that our generation of baby boomers can be a bit of a problem for the planet.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carlus Padrissa and his theatre collective, La Fura dels Baus, are marking the 500th anniversary of the first circumnavigation of the globe. Photograph: La Fura dels Baus\n\nHe also notes that the Naumon was originally an ice-breaker: \u201cSo it\u2019s a perfect concept for smashing cultural ice.\u201d\n\nIn each port, the company will stage Sfera Mundi, a big show that follows on from the spectacle La Fura dels Baus created for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Key themes will include poverty, illness and pollution.\n\nThe Naumon itself will also play host to an immersive exhibition.\n\n\u201cIt will be about the possibility of a third world war and what will happen if the world falls apart because of climate change,\u201d says Padrissa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a little apocalyptic, a little bit like Picasso\u2019s Guernica. We want people to come out and say: \u2018Shit! What do I have to do to stop things happening?\u2019\u201d\n\nWith the Naumon undergoing its latest metamorphosis as the sail is attached and its hull painted in the colours of the UN sustainable development goals, Padrissa and other members of the collective find themselves suffering anxieties long shared by theatre companies and expedition planners.\n\nFears of seasickness and scurvy, of mutiny or of being reduced to eating leather are overshadowed by thoughts of empty coffers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest La Fura dels Baus took inspiration from Ferdinand Magellan\u2019s circumnavigation of the globe in the 16th century.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a bit worried about money \u2013 we don\u2019t know exactly how much things will cost because we don\u2019t really know where we\u2019ll be going,\u201d says Padrissa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent money bringing the Naumon back; we\u2019ve spent money fixing it up. We don\u2019t have any more money. We\u2019ve got some deals lined up but we\u2019re worried about being able to pull it off properly. We don\u2019t have the dosh to get all the way around the world.\u201d\n\nBut then again, he adds, the whole enterprise is a bit on the hoof, or keel. And that is rather the point.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no plan,\u201d says Padrissa. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like Magellan: they set off but they weren\u2019t really sure where they were going or what they\u2019d find. It\u2019s all an adventure. Will we do it? Won\u2019t we? Will we ruin ourselves? We don\u2019t know. It\u2019s about risk and adventure.\u201d", "description": "La Fura dels Baus want to circumnavigate the globe on a refitted ice-breaker to draw attention to the climate emergency", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f6749ca01c02dc430d7bdcc8cc6c766df78437/255_72_1362_817/master/1362.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=414fa758da149c355c500a2a9ee654c7", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
