(Picture: Getty/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHave you ever taken a moment to consider why we refer to great sex as mind-blowing?\n\nWhat you\u2019re describing is an experience that affected you to such a degree that not only did it do amazing things to your body, but it also influenced your mind.\n\nIn other words: it gave you \u2018sex brain\u2019.\n\nThere are a variety of feelings you might experience, such as having a fuzzy head, having difficulty putting together a coherent thought or even the urge to say something you otherwise would take more time to consider (such as I love you).\n\nWhen you\u2019re having sex, it triggers certain parts of your brain and slows down other parts.\n\nNeuroscience has shown that the limbic system, which controls your physical urges, lights up while you\u2019re between the sheets, which is why you find it harder to make decisions on anything that isn\u2019t related to your impending orgasm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you have a clear head, you will think about the potential consequences of your actions, but if you\u2019re mid-foreplay or mid-sex, your brain will push these thoughts aside because sex brain is telling your mind and body that it\u2019s a good idea, because it\u2019s so pleasurable.\n\nAs the expression goes, \u2018how can something that feels so good be so wrong\u2019.\n\nFor instance, you might have sex with someone you wouldn\u2019t normally consider, such as an ex or someone who is in a relationship.\n\nYou\u2019re so focused on the physical and emotional response that the hormones in your brain are giving you that your brain is (partially) unable to make sound decisions.\n\n\u2018When we have sex a flood of hormones and neurotransmitters are released throughout our bodies, affecting the reward centres of the brain,\u2019 Dr Shirin Lakhani, intimate health specialist and owner of Elite Aesthetics in Kent, tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018Dopamine is released and this helps us to feel giddy, energetic and euphoric. Oxytocin is also released during sex, which promotes bonding and affection.\u2019\n\nWhen oxytocin \u2013 also known as the \u2018cuddle\u2019 hormone \u2013 is released, it influences your mind with feelings of love, bonding and general well-being. On a physical level, it also affects your uterus, especially during pregnancy where it helps start contractions and lowers your stress levels.\n\nThe dopamine, which regulates your body\u2019s movement, attention span and emotional responses, plays its part, too. It\u2019s also released when you take certain drugs, such as ecstasy, and gives people such a high that it can be highly addictive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlooding your bloodstream with dopamine during sex is completely healthy but the addiction element is still there.\n\nThe hormones can alter your thinking and actions, and many people go on \u2018auto-mode\u2019 without actively considering what they\u2019re doing.\n\nDoes it feel good to push your body closer? Do you feel the urge to nibble on your lover\u2019s shoulder, even though you\u2019ve never \u2013 consciously \u2013 thought about it before?\n\nDopamine, along with oxytocin, is letting your urges call the shots, and you\u2019re filled with pleasure because of it. That being said, the logical side of your brain is still there, but has switched off for the time being.\n\nAnd while hormones induce bonding feelings, it doesn\u2019t mean this will always lead to slow, sensual or romantic sex.\n\nHate sex can trigger the same physical response, alongside a boost of adrenaline \u2013 which is also released when you\u2019re angry \u2013 and serotonin, a happy chemical.\n\nExternal factors can affect your sex brain as well, such as how you\u2019re feeling before you start having sex.\n\n\u2018A study by The Journal of Sexual Medicinei n 2017 examined brain activity before, during and immediately after female orgasm,\u2019 Dr Sarah Welsh, who works with the condom brand Hanx, tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018It found that brain activity was heightened during orgasm, with increased activity in several parts of the brain, suggesting the brain is heavily affected during sexual activity, as well as the body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Oxytocin helps regulate cortisol, the stress hormone, which can in turn induce calmness and improve stress symptoms. Other studies have found that sex can lower blood pressure, improve memory, and help with pain symptoms. The activity and increase in blood flow around the body is to thank for this!\u2019\n\nSex and masturbation can be great stress-relievers, but hormones can only do so much.\n\nThe hormones will give you a temporary boost of emotions, but if you\u2019re already experiencing feelings such as stress or anxiety, this could work its way through the sex brain.\n\nLet us explain: say you\u2019re having sex and everything feels great, when suddenly you remember the anxiety you felt when you were at work earlier that day \u2013 this can break through the fuzziness that we mentioned earlier and your \u2018active\u2019 thinking once again takes charge.\n\nJust as there is sex brain, there is also post-orgasm brain.\n\nThe orgasm releases another shot of oxytocin from the brain\u2019s pituitary gland, as well as endorphins (which are also released during exercise) and you\u2019ll feel relaxed, happy and sleepy.\n\nJust because you\u2019re influenced by hormonal compounds, you\u2019re not ever completely at the mercy of them \u2013 meaning there is no excuse to be cruel or unkind to someone (or cheat) because of it.\n\nSex brain only does so much \u2013 the rest is all you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: There\u2019s now a special spongy tool to soak up semen after sex\n\nMORE: People tell us about the time they had sex with a colleague\n\nMORE: Women want their ideal partner to have an average penis, not a big one \u2013 why?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "We ask experts to explain what happens in the brain when you have sex and how this affects your decision-making, as well as your body.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88355578_1570197453.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
