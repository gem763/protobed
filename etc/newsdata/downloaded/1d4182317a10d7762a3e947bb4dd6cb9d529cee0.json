Weiss, the duo that adapted Game of Thrones into a pop culture sensation.\n\nKasdan\u2019s attachment to Star Wars reaches 40 years, to when he co-wrote the scripts for 1980\u2019s The Empire Strikes Back (widely regarded as the best of the franchise) and its 1983 sequel, Return of the Jedi.\n\nKathleen Kennedy, who runs the franchise now, talked Kasdan into returning for the Disney reboot. He ended up with a writing credit on The Force Awakens (2015) and, along with his son, wrote the box office dud Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018).\n\nLast week, at the Austin Film Festival, Kasdan announced he\u2019s had enough.\n\nAs far as Solo, the franchise\u2019s first box office catastrophe, Kasdan said \u201cthe studio blew it.\u201d\n\nTo entice him back for a second time, though, Kennedy had a Star Wars script messengered to his house to hand deliver it.\n\n\u201cI never saw this poor messenger they sent,\u201d Kasdan explans. \u201cI said, \u2018I can\u2019t take it.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to sit down and read someone else\u2019s Star Wars movie. I\u2019m just not interested in Star Wars.\u201d\n\nWith all kinds of fanfare, Benioff and Weiss were brought on by Kennedy to launch an all-new Star Wars trilogy, one that would be set in the universe created by Lucas, but separate from everything involving the Empire, Luke Skywalker, etc.\n\nThe pair now says they have just discovered they don\u2019t have the time for Star Wars.\n\nYeah. Okay.\n\nThe reason they don\u2019t have the time is because they signed a major deal with Netflix a couple of months ago. In other words, they fled Star Wars to do something else.\n\n\u201cWe love Star Wars,\u201d the duo told the far-left Deadline. \u201cWhen George Lucas built it, he built us too. Getting to talk about Star Wars with him and the current Star Wars team was the thrill of a lifetime, and we will always be indebted to the saga that changed everything.\u201d\n\nYeah, but they still left, didn\u2019t they?\n\nDeadline attempted to spin this defection as not mattering with a paragraph that literally made me laugh out loud:\n\nLucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has plenty of other Star Wars projects in the hopper \u2014 The Rise of Skywalker in December, The Madalorian in 15 days on Disney+, and the ramping Ewan McGregor series, to name just three \u2014 so it\u2019s unclear how much of a setback the now-nixed trilogy presents. There\u2019s no shortage of upcoming collaborators lined up, either, among them Rian Johnson and Kevin Feige.\n\nAll those Star Wars projects Deadline names as \u201cin the hopper\u201d are \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 TV shows\u2026 TEEEEEEVEEEEEE shows, y\u2019all. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all Kennedy\u2019s got. After the release of the Rise of Skywalker in a few weeks, the Star Wars film slate is dead. Nothing planned. Nothing announced. There\u2019s nothing in that particular, somewhat important, you might even say vital hopper.\n\nAnd then we get to the names, those names that prove there\u2019s \u201cno shortage of collaborators,\u201d and one of the two names is Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, a movie that not only under-performed at the box office (although it was a big hit), but caused such a backlash in the Star Wars community, so much anger and frustration, it almost certainly is one of the primary reasons Solo tanked.\n\nRian Johnson has become the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Wars fanboys, and for good reason. The Last Jedi was polluted with identity politics, obnoxious and heavy-handed feminist posturing, and terrible storytelling. For all of George Lucas\u2019 faults, even in his rather exhausting and empty prequels, he never betrayed his characters or his own mythology. Johnson turned our idealistic Luke Skywalker into a cowardly curmudgeon who tried to murder a kid, and then took a big dump on the Jedi mythology, the very thing that made Star Wars so special.\n\nAnd then Deadline name-drops Kevin Feige, the genius behind the Marvel Universe. Come on, y\u2019all. Not only has Feige been infected with Woke Politics, how much time will he have to \u201csave\u201d Star Wars as he moves into the next Marvel Phase, which is basically starting from nothing, and takes over the X-Men characters now under his wing with the Fox merger?\n\nYou want to know why Feige was name-dropped? Because he\u2019s the only name left under the Disney banner they could drop.\n\nYou sure as hell can\u2019t tell the fans, \u201cWell, at least Star Wars still has Kathleen Kennedy.\u201d She\u2019s done more damage to the film franchise than even Rian Johnson.\n\nI don\u2019t know about Star Wars and TV. I have no desire to subscribe to Disney+, and I certainly don\u2019t want to watch anything produced by the wretched Kennedy and her wretched politics and her wretched desire to kill off everything and everyone we love with her Year Zero Feminism. And we\u2019ll never really know how well these shows do, because they are streaming.\n\nBut I do know that Star Wars as a movie franchise, a franchise that had intended to go the full-Marvel with at least two new releases a year, is in deep, deep trouble. The Rise of Skywalker will undoubtedly be a huge hit. It\u2019s the last chapter of 40-year-old franchise and people will want to see that, but then what\u2026\n\nThen what?\n\nKennedy has killed off our beloved characters, introduced new characters no one cares about, and poisoned everything by injecting present-day leftism into what is supposed to be thematically-driven escapism.\n\nNo one wanted to see Solo\u2026 Think about that: no one wanted to see a Star Wars movie for crying out loud!\n\nAnd that is Kathleen Kennedy\u2019s legacy\u2026 That and the fact that no one with any real talent wants to work for her because she has so mishandled the biggest no-brainer franchise ever it\u2019s now got nowhere to go but television.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
