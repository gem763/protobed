A court hearing has been set for 27 November.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Michelin said: \"We understand the disappointment of Mr Veyrat, whose talent no-one disputes... we will study his requests carefully and respond.\"\n\nVeyrat, who has previously obtained three star ratings at two other restaurants, asked in July for La Maison des Bois to be removed from the Michelin guide altogether. His request was denied by the guide's directors, who said they would \"continue to recommend it\".\n\nThe restaurant guide, originally designed for motorists looking for places to stop off and eat, said its two star rating acknowledged \"excellent cooking, worth a detour\", while three stars meant that it was \"worth a special journey\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How to recover a lost Michelin star\n\nIn 2015, Veyrat was fined for razing 75,000 sq ft (7,000 sq m) of protected forest near his La Maison des Bois restaurant, on the Col de la Croix Fry mountain pass near the Swiss border.\n\nHe said at the time that it was necessary to build an educational centre for children and that he had acted with the best of intentions.", "description": "Celebrity chef demands answers after losing three star status due to \"cheddar in our souffl\u00e9\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6E52/production/_108924282_gettyimages-914585506.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
