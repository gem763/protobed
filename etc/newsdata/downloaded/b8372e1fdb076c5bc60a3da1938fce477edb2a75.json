REUTERS/Issam Abdallah\n\nBadran Jia Kurd\u2019s comments to Reuters reflect the predicament facing Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria following a partial withdrawal of U.S. troops who have effectively shielded the area from Turkish attack.\n\nThe United States withdrew 50 American special forces from a section of the Turkish border on Monday, opening the way for Turkey to stage a long-threatened incursion against Syrian Kurdish-led forces that it deems as terrorists.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has described the U.S. decision as \u201ca stab in the back\u201d. Spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, the SDF has been a major part of the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State.\n\n\u201cIf America vacates the area and especially the border area for certain we, as a self administration and as the SDF, will be forced to study all the available options,\u201d Jia Kurd told Reuters.\n\n\u201cAt that time we may hold talks with Damascus or the Russian side to fill the void or block the Turkish attack, so this may develop and there could be meetings and contacts in case of a vacuum,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkey said on Tuesday it had completed preparations for a military operation in the northeast. It views the YPG as a terrorist organisation because of its links to Kurdish militants who have waged a long insurgency in Turkey.\n\nThe Kurdish-led administration found itself in a similar position in late 2018 when President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria. The SDF held talks in Damascus that broke down without progress.\n\nDespite enmity between Syrian Kurds and Damascus, the result of years of systematic persecution of Kurds under the rule of the Baathist government, the dominant Syrian Kurdish groups have seldom fought the Syrian government during the war.\n\nWhile the Syrian rebellion has fought to topple President Bashar al-Assad, the YPG says its priority is to maintain regional autonomy as part of the Syrian state.\n\nDamascus however is loathe to cede the Kurds the level of autonomy they seek. The government earlier this year threatened the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces with military defeat if they did not agree to a return of state authority.", "description": "The Kurdish-led authorities in northern Syria may open talks with Damascus and Russia to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Turkish border area, a Syrian Kurdish official said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ellen Francis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438415933&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970Q9", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
