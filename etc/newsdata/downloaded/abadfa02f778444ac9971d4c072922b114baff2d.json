Ed Markey. | Alex Brandon, file/AP Photo Elections Senate Dems' campaign arm backs Ed Markey over Joe Kennedy\n\nSenate Democrats\u2019 campaign committee is siding with incumbent Sen. Ed Markey over potential insurgent challenger Rep. Joe Kennedy III, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nThe Nevada senator, who chairs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the DSCC \u201cwill be there\u201d for Markey if Kennedy launches a challenge.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we were created, to support our incumbents. And Ed Markey is not only an incumbent but he knows the issues that are important to Massachusetts. He\u2019s been out front on so many issues, including climate change,\u201d Cortez Masto said. \u201cHe\u2019s the candidate.\u201d\n\nThe 38-year-old Kennedy has formed an exploratory committee as he considers a run for Massachusetts\u2019 Senate seat, which is held by the 73-year-old Markey. Kennedy said he\u2019s been advised to wait his turn by some in the party, but wrote in an August Facebook post that he\u2019s \u201cnot sure this is a moment for waiting.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Kennedy is serious about running against Markey in a primary or is trying to scare the senator into retirement. Kennedy also could be trying to increase visibility in case Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wins the presidency and the state holds a special election for her seat. Warren has endorsed Markey.\n\nA race between Markey and Kennedy would be a major distraction for Democrats trying to defeat President Donald Trump and take back the Senate majority, pitting the dean of the state\u2019s delegation against a scion of Massachusetts political royalty. Kennedy has led early polls, but the Massachusetts primary isn\u2019t until September. The filing deadline is June.\n\nRepublicans are hopeful a contested primary between the two Democrats could suck away resources from the larger battle for the Senate. Cortez Masto said she couldn\u2019t say whether the DSCC would need to expend resources in the race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate. It\u2019s too far in and we\u2019ll see how it plays out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, yes, the DSCC will be there to support him.\u201d", "description": "Joe Kennedy III has formed an exploratory committee as he considers a run for Massachusetts\u2019 Senate seat.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e1/e2/598959694e93b3fd91506c4a0b60/190910-ed-markey-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
