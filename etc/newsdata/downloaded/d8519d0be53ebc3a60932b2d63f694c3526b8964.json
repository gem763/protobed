I would have given her a much tougher punishment, only then she will start being responsible for her actions.'\n\n'Dilman78' added: 'I think this dog needs to be put to sleep.'", "description": "WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT: The incident took place in the city of Nizhnevartovsk in central Russia and shows the bull terrier climbing on the girl and attacking her.", "authors": ["Amelia Wynne For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/12/19738066-0-image-a-13_1571139512197.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
