The Brazilian then moved on to defeat Akhmed Aliev, who held the clear edge in the stand-up exchanges between the two. But Schulte adjusted his game, took his man to the mat in the second round, then finished him with a tight arm-triangle choke.\n\nChatting to reporters, including MMA Junkie, backstage after his two wins, the defending champion declared himself satisfied with his night\u2019s work.\n\nSpeaking through an interpreter, Schulte said: \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy with my performance. I could listen to everything my coaches were telling me. I trained a lot to make this happen and leave no doubt who\u2019s the best. I\u2019m really happy.\n\n\u201cI want to make history here in the PFL. Obviously, I did by being the first lightweight champion. I want to continue what I\u2019m hoping to do to be the second season lightweight champion again. I just want to make history here.\u201d\n\nSchulte submitted Nijem inside the opening minute of their quarterfinal matchup to set up a semifinal clash with dangerous striker Aliev. And while he was comprehensively outstruck by the Russian, Schulte was able to find a path to victory via his grappling.\n\n\u201cI always knew he was going to be one of my toughest challenges,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI knew he was a very dangerous and very good striker. He took me down pretty nicely, but I was calm enough to be able to revert, get the takedowns on my own, and listen to my jiu-jitsu coaches who told me to go to the kata-gatame. So I\u2019m really proud of myself that I could get out of that adversity and finish the fight the way I did.\u201d\n\nThere were high expectations of a potential final matchup between Schulte and former foe Chris Wade, with the pair battling all the way to a split decision in last season\u2019s semifinals. But Wade lost out to Loik Radzhabov in the night\u2019s other semifinal, meaning Schulte will now face the Tajikistan fighter in the season finale in New York City.\n\nThe 27-year-old said he wasn\u2019t preoccupied with who he might be facing in the final. He\u2019ll just be ready, regardless.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to be focused on my next opponent. I need to be focused on whoever makes the final. It would be this guy or Loik. I\u2019m going to be prepared for New York City.\u201d", "description": "PFL lightweight champion Natan Schulte chats to the media after booking his place in the 2019 final with back-to-back wins in Las Vegas.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Ken Hathaway", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Dave Doyle", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/natan-schulte-pfl-2019-playoffs-2-post-fight-interview.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
