She told her aides there would be no grand send-off, no celebration of a mission accomplished.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had been her idea from the start: a new arm of the government, uniquely empowered to police the kinds of loans and financial schemes that led to the Great Recession. Ms. Warren had detailed the idea in a journal article, then cajoled and pressured Congress to make it law. She was tasked by President Barack Obama in 2010 with setting up the bureau, and spent a year recruiting investigators and enforcers for an office they saw as an exhilarating cause.\n\nBut as spring turned to summer in 2011, Ms. Warren faced a wrenching separation. The White House had decided not to nominate her to lead the bureau permanently. So she gathered the staff for an \u201call hands\u201d meeting and told them her work there was over.\n\n\u201cShe told us that we were ready to sail the ship, that we did not need her there, and that we would be able to do it on our own,\u201d said Patricia McCoy, a Boston College law professor who was a senior official at the bureau.", "description": "She had a plan to take on big banks.
