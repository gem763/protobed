After that, though, costume rules can be very murky.\n\nBut the topic of costumes and appropriation is a heated one in Canadian conversation, with many parents asserting their rights for their kids to dress however they want. These debates are exacerbated by costume shops that sell afros and headdresses as \u201ccostumes,\u201d and by mega companies like Disney whose beloved film characters often become any given year\u2019s costume of choice.\n\nSo, here: seven things I urge you to consider when costume shopping.\n\n1. What is cultural appropriation?\n\nWhen we talk about cultural appropriation, it might be helpful to think of it as cultural \u201cmisappropriation.\u201d It\u2019s when we pick and choose elements of a certain culture to suit our needs \u2014 in this case, wearing them as a costume. This is especially problematic when white people borrow from people of colour.\n\nThe reason why it doesn\u2019t work both ways \u2014 why it\u2019s not problematic for my biracial son to don a Donald Trump wig, for example \u2014 is because white people are not discriminated against for our hair, our clothes and our skin.\n\nRecommended Reading: Why White Parents Need to Talk to Their Kids About Racism\n\n2. If you have to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s just a costume!\u201d then recognize that you probably benefit from a level of privilege.\n\n\u201cPrivilege\u201d is not a pejorative. Let me say it again: Privilege, white privilege and male privilege are NOT pejoratives. Almost everyone benefits from some level of privilege, and it doesn\u2019t make you a bad person for having it. But the vast majority of white people in this country simply don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be marginalized based on our appearance or our beliefs. We don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have our culture discriminated against one minute, and then worn as a costume the next.\n\nWhat may not feel like a big deal to white people (\"it\u2019s just a costume!\") is triggering or painful for people of colour.\n\n3. Empathy is a beautiful thing to teach our kids.\n\nIn my opinion, empathy is the most important emotion of all emotions. Put yourself in your fellow Canadians\u2019 shoes. There are Indigenous communities in this country that have gone without clean drinking water for years. Is it any wonder that they are dismayed seeing their culture misappropriated for the purpose of fun on one night a year, when it\u2019s ignored by those same people the remaining 364?\n\nIf you truly want to honour the culture of Indigenous people, roll your sleeves up politically, become an advocate and an ally and put away the costume headdress.\n\n4. Being sensitive and politically correct are still good things.\n\nDonald Trump-style politics have \u2014 of late \u2014 labelled political correctness and sensitivity scourges of society. But until we live in a post-racial utopia, I\u2019ll take political correctness and sensitivity every time.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we shut down the conversation or that we\u2019re averse to different ideas or political opinions. And that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a bad person for really wanting your child to have the Halloween of his or her dreams. But humility and the ability to learn from our mistakes and admit that we are wrong are wonderful things to model to our kids. Because, hopefully, as a society, we\u2019re teaching our children to be better than we are.\n\nRecommended Reading: 5 Easy No-Sew Halloween Costumes\n\n5. ALWAYS defer to the perspective of people of colour.\n\nHaving three biracial sons (I\u2019m white and my husband is black) does not make me an expert on this topic. And no matter how woke you think you are, if you are a white person, you aren\u2019t either.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t sure about a costume, Google it. These issues have been well documented and discussed at length by people of colour all over the internet. No one person speaks for their entire culture and opinions within a culture vary \u2014 sometimes within a wide spectrum. But in this situation, their insight matters more than yours, and that\u2019s OK.\n\n6. You\u2019re not off the hook if you\u2019re dressing up as the \u201ccharacter\u201d and not the \u201cculture.\u201d\n\nBefore your kid dons the costume of his or her favourite character, do a little research. Not all characters are created equally.\n\nWas that character imagined with respect to that particular culture in mind? Is the character respectful and representative? Or, is the character a caricature, or worse \u2014 but so often the case \u2014 tacky and sexualized?\n\nI truly believe that most of us don\u2019t feel that our good time should come at the expense of someone else\u2019s.\n\nDisney\u2019s Aladdin and Pocahontas, for example, were not conceived in consultation with Arab and Native American people the way Disney\u2019s Moana was with Polynesian people. In the latter case, Disney employed Polynesian writers on the film and cast Polynesian voice actors. And while it\u2019s an important distinction to make, that doesn\u2019t mean that everyone can dress up as Moana characters without thinking it through \u2014 Pacific Islanders have pointed out that tattoos are deeply significant and meaningful to Polynesian people, for example, and any would-be Mauis should consider that.\n\n7. When in doubt, just don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that donning blackface or brownface is totally inappropriate. And most people know that afros and headdresses are offensive. After that, though, costume rules can be very murky.\n\nBut I still believe that most Canadians don\u2019t want to disrespect anyone. I truly believe that most of us don\u2019t feel that our good time should come at the expense of someone else\u2019s.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re not sure about a costume, explain your feelings to your child and move on. Their classrooms and friend groups are \u2014 in big cities and small towns \u2014 more diverse than ever. You\u2019ll be surprised at how progressive and thoughtful your kid is. They don\u2019t want to be \u201cthat guy\u201d either.", "description": "As the conversation around Halloween and cultural appropriation heats up, here are tips to help you make respectful costume choices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/culturalcostumes_lead_123RF.jpg", "published_at": "2017-10-12"}
