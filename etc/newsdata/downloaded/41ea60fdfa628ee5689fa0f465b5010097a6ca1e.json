He assumed the role of spokesman for the organization when his predecessor was killed by an airstrike in 2016, according to the AP.", "description": "A top lieutenant of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a joint operation by U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/syriaturkeymilitaryaction_101519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
