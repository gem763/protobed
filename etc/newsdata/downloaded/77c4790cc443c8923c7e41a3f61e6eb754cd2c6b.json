We\u2019re chatting in her publisher\u2019s office in Toronto when I mention the dating show where 30-some men vie for the affection of a single woman, all on camera. She has questions: \u201cWhy are they even participating in this?\u201d \u201cWhat if they\u2019re rejected?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m wondering if she\u2019s just pretending to go along with it?\u201d\n\nThere is an irony here, observing Atwood equate the show to Sartre\u2019s adage \u201cHell is other people\u201d come to life. She is, after all, known for a book that describes one of the most brutal mating rituals in the canon. In her landmark 1985 novel, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, a totalitarian theocracy has taken over the U.S. in the midst of a fertility crisis. Offred, one of few women who can still bear children, is forced to participate in reproductive-slavery ceremonies in the Republic of Gilead. Offred\u2019s story ends with a notoriously ambiguous cliff-hanger: she steps into a van that will take her either to fresh hell or to freedom. For 34 years, Atwood, now 79, has deflected readers\u2019 questions about her protagonist\u2019s fate. But on Sept. 10, she will publish The Testaments, a new book that promises to resolve that mystery and many more.\n\nThe Testaments arrives at the peak of Atwood\u2019s prominence. In 2017, her 32-year-old novel soared back to the best-seller list when it became one of a handful of classic dystopias that seemed to portend troubling themes of the current era and evoke prescient anxieties about women\u2019s rights. Three months after Donald Trump\u2019s Inauguration, Hulu premiered an adaptation with Atwood\u2019s involvement that has won 11 Emmys. Women\u2019s-rights demonstrators around the globe \u2014 at pro-choice rallies in South America and Europe, at Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing in the U.S. \u2014 have donned the handmaid uniform of crimson cloaks and white bonnets to make their case. Atwood\u2019s voice has become a rallying cry against climate change and threats to equality \u2014 last year she headlined a summit on the intersection of those issues, named after a reference to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Protest signs at the 2017 Women\u2019s March bore the slogan \u201cMake Margaret Atwood fiction again,\u201d her name now synonymous with resistance.\n\nAtwood long rejected calls for a sequel because, she says, she knew she couldn\u2019t re-create Offred\u2019s voice. But as she saw the world change, she realized Offred wasn\u2019t the only way back into the story. She began drafting The Testaments partway through 2016.\n\nThe anticipation has few precedents. The U.S. publisher announced a 500,000-copy first-print run, and the novel made the Man Booker Prize short list despite a strict embargo. Atwood will launch it with a live interview onstage in London, which will stream to 1,300 cinemas around the world. It\u2019s a larger-than-life reception for a larger-than-life figure, one still a tad bewildered by the fanfare. She makes a point of stating the obvious: \u201cIt\u2019s just a book.\u201d\n\n***\n\nGrowing up in Canada, Atwood wrote whenever she could \u2014 in the high school yearbook, in a college magazine under the pseudonym Shakesbeat Latweed. Her early jobs included a teen venture in puppeteering and later market research, and she published her first novel, The Edible Woman, in 1969. Since then she has published more than 60 works of fiction, non-fiction, graphic novels, poetry and children\u2019s literature. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was a breakthrough, landing her on the Booker short list for the first time. In 2000, she became the first Canadian woman to win the award, for The Blind Assassin.\n\nPhotograph by Mickalene Thomas for TIME\n\nOn the patio of her neighborhood caf\u00e9, Atwood glances over her shoulder to scan for eavesdroppers. \u201cThings never used to be like this,\u201d she says, peeking out from under a sun hat. Caution is justified: the plot of The Testaments is the closest-guarded secret in publishing since Harry Potter lived (again). Impostors posing as book agents tried to steal the digital manuscript, so publishers around the world agreed to go analog. Rare copies were distributed under fake names, like The Casements by Victoria Locket.\n\nAtwood famously wrote part of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in Cold War\u2013era Berlin, influenced by the fog of distrust that shrouded the East. That same atmosphere propels the sequel, which is narrated by three women. One was raised in Gilead, too young at its rise to remember a life before it; another is a Canadian teen with a past she has yet to understand; the third is Aunt Lydia, a villain in the regime and the only one of the three to have appeared in the foreground of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. In swift prose \u2014 lightened by winking references to American history, like a caf\u00e9 named for anti\u2013Equal Rights Amendment activist Phyllis Schlafly \u2014 Atwood weaves together three distinct narratives to chronicle the rise and fall of Gilead.\n\nOver the course of several interviews, Atwood doles out measured tidbits about her experience writing the book. She admits to feeling some nerves about the highly anticipated project but closes the topic with a pat \u201cWhat is life without challenges?\u201d She often veers toward history and deadpans jokes; she\u2019s not a \u201cDear Diary\u2013type of person,\u201d she says. When asked how she feels about the excitement surrounding The Testaments, she offers a few words but soon dives into a lesson on Icelandic manuscripts. Before describing her path to writing in terms of the politics of the 1940s and \u201950s, she pauses to ask when I was born. \u201cThat\u2019s hilarious,\u201d she says. \u201cYou remember nothing.\u201d\n\nAtwood\u2019s talent for capturing history\u2019s tendency to repeat itself has led some to call her a prophet. (She insists she\u2019s not \u2014 just ask her old colleagues at the market-research firm where she declared Pop-Tarts would never take off.) Certain scenes from The Testaments \u2014 children ripped from the arms of their parents, flights across borders, inhumane detention centers \u2014 track closely with today\u2019s headlines. But Atwood can point to multiple historical examples for each. She has a rule that each of the dark circumstances, rules and customs in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, The Testaments and the TV show, which range from genocide to ritual rape, must have a historical precedent. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people saying, like some have said, \u2018How did you make up all this twisted stuff?'\u201d\n\nShe sees her role as the person who drops a flare on the highway \u2014 she wrote the new book in part because she worries the world is trending more toward Gilead than away from it. A child of the \u201930s, Atwood sees authoritarianism tightening its grip in Europe, but also in leading U.S. Republicans\u2019 response to election interference: \u201cIt just does not compute,\u201d she says. \u201cUnless of course what they really want is an authoritarian regime. If that\u2019s what they really want, spit it out: \u2018We hate democracy.'\u201d\n\nYet even in Atwood\u2019s darkest writing, optimism prevails. Both Gilead novels end with scenes that indicate common sense has triumphed. Their narrators record their stories for the benefit of history, a perspective that leaves room to hope for a better world. \u201cIf you are reading,\u201d Atwood writes in Lydia\u2019s determined voice, \u201cthis manuscript at least will have survived.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOne autumn, as Atwood was sweeping leaves outside her Toronto mansion, the man next door told her people refer to her as the \u201cwicked witch\u201d of the neighborhood. (The broom didn\u2019t help.) Her mythology precedes her. Bruce Miller, the Handmaid\u2019s showrunner, remembers every head turning as she entered a restaurant. When someone at the table asked her what it\u2019s like to be a national treasure, she offered a perfectly Atwood response: \u201cExhausting.\u201d\n\nThe author exists in a surreal intersection between her image and her life\u2019s more stark realities, where caring for loved ones often takes precedence. Her partner, the novelist Graeme Gibson, is living with dementia. The morning after a doctor\u2019s visit, Atwood runs through to-dos in the basement office in her home: there are appointments to schedule and bills to pay, a condo dispute to chase. (She stays in caretaking mode with me: \u201cYou were a naughty person, you didn\u2019t eat any muffins,\u201d she scolds, then sends me off with banana bread.)\n\nAtwood has never been the type for superstitious writing rituals. She wrote The Testaments in hotels around the world, on trains and planes, wherever the phone couldn\u2019t ring. Gibson wanted to re-create a voyage from his youth, traveling by ship to Australia. So Atwood did the first edit of The Testaments over the 21 days at sea while he slept.\n\nShe has a list of things she\u2019d like to do but wonders if she\u2019s too old: trek across Baffin Island, travel to Africa. She won\u2019t say for sure whether she\u2019ll write more Gilead novels (fans: it\u2019s not a no) \u2014 in fact, she\u2019s not much for discussing her future at all. Someday, she acknowledges, she\u2019ll be \u201cforcibly\u201d retired. But she takes aging in stride. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of respect that comes with being the me that people recognize,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if it\u2019s the me that people don\u2019t recognize, I\u2019m just another old lady.\u201d\n\nIn her office, Atwood strides past shelves of her archives \u2014 first editions, foreign translations, the original art from the best-known Handmaid\u2019s Tale cover \u2014 pulling an item here and there to give away. Later she\u2019ll meditate on the meaning behind our choices of what we keep and what we discard. What she\u2019s really talking about is legacy, what we leave behind and how it may one day prove useful to our \u201cDear Readers,\u201d whoever they may be. She asks me how many love letters from 1961 she should keep, and I suggest she hold on to the ones that speak to her, missing the point. \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters whether they speak to me or not,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether they speak is more interesting.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Lucy Feldman"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/2019-09-time-atwood-mbj-murphy-cover-flip_800x600.gif?w=600", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
