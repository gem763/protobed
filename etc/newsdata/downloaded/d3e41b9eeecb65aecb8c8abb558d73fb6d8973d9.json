Consumers can feel the difference \u2014 and a new policy approach might be on the horizon\n\nAs the new European Commission prepares to settle in, the world of human communications has been permanently changed by technology. European Commissioners, in their mission letters and parliamentary hearings, appear determined to ensure EU policies catch up with such changes.\n\nCommissioners-designate Margrethe Vestager, Sylvie Goulard, Didier Reynders and Mariya Gabriel \u2014 among others \u2014 are on a mission to assert European values, empower digital citizens and make Europe stronger in the global digital economy. In this context, I would like to share some of key highlights from the study Delivering Consumer Value in Digital Times, prepared by Assembly Research for ETNO and presented this week in Brussels.\n\nEuropean telecoms services are rapidly evolving\n\nThe study finds that European consumers are eagerly taking up data-driven services and are increasingly communicating across digital channels. Forms of communication have radically changed: consumers eagerly adopt tools as diverse as encrypted messaging services or app-based communication tools. Also, data is now the main value-proposition for telecoms customers, with increasingly large, or unlimited, packages to allow extensive and seamless data-hungry habits.\n\nCommissioners-designate are on a mission to assert European values \u2026 in the global digital economy.\n\nForget the old offers: digital users want bundling\n\nThe study reveals that Europeans have a broad choice of telecoms service providers, and a wide range of offers. Among others, bundles are very popular with consumers: their uptake is high and consumers tend to be more satisfied with packages than standalone products. In addition, offers are increasingly tailored and diverse, including more than just connectivity. This includes direct access to premium video content, music streaming or to personalized cloud storage.\n\nFrom the phone shop to a multichannel experience\n\nAs offers become more tailored and complex, European telecoms companies are increasing their customer focus and engaging more closely with end users. Telecoms companies have developed an omnichannel approach: customers are able to engage through AI-enabled apps, social media and online portals, as well as traditional channels such as stores and by phone. This approach includes innovative accessibility features, which are leveraging smartphone technology as a key enabler of access to online content for people with disabilities.\n\nThe digital landscape keeps on changing and with this comes the need to develop new policy strategies for European digital leadership.\n\nTelecoms companies as a shelter for trust and data protection\n\nIn an increasingly data-driven society, trust appears to be a significant asset for telecoms operators. The sector scores at the top for confidentiality of information, also thanks to regulation. However, telecoms companies are going the extra mile in launching tools to allow customers to control their data. This includes apps, data cockpits and a customer relationship system geared towards protection and control of own data. Users appear eager to find a trusted partner that helps them to protect and control their data, and telecoms companies are increasingly putting forward tools to fill this major gap.\n\nThe \u2018new networks\u2019 effect\n\nIncreased investment in telecoms networks, especially ubiquitous connectivity, is improving customers\u2019 perception of telecoms services. As telecoms companies invest in 4G, 5G and fiber upgrades, consumers in key European markets increasingly judge the service good or satisfactory. This happens as telecoms companies continue scaling up investment in both mobile and fixed connectivity.\n\nIn an increasingly data-driven society, trust appears to be a significant asset.\n\nThe digital landscape keeps on changing and with this comes the need to develop new policy strategies for European digital leadership. The new European Parliament and European Commission are preparing to provide fresh political guidance on the digital world. I know they find the telecoms sector ready to help for what is a gigantic challenge: continue delivering top value for consumers, while putting Europe back at the center of the global digital map.\n\nAuthors:\n\nThe above column is sponsor-generated content.
