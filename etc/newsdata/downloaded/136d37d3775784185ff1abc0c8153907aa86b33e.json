It has helped having players here who have been on the Lions tour and played against New Zealand. They have been involved in some of the biggest games in world rugby so this semi-final won\u2019t faze them.\u201d\n\nThere were 16 England players originally selected for that tour, where the series was drawn 1-1, with a draw in the final test, 13 of whom are in the current World Cup squad.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand are a great team ... like any good team, you have to take away time and space from them and you have to find areas you can pressure them,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe believe we have identified a number of areas where we can do that.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s move to the bench last week was seen as a way to stiffen the midfield to counter the physical threat of Australia centre Samu Kerevi. New Zealand\u2019s centres, Anton Lienert-Brown and Jack Goodhue, bring a different, more technical and mobile threat, which Jones is confident Ford can handle.\n\nHaving him and Farrell back in harness, as they were for most of the World Cup warm-ups and pool games, gives more attacking options, with the likelihood that Ford will give way for Slade in the second half.\n\nEngland have beaten New Zealand only once in their last 16 meetings, though the last game between them was a close one as the All Blacks came from 15-0 down to win 16-15 at Twickenham a year ago.\n\nThey last reached the final in 2007, losing to South Africa, while New Zealand are seeking a third successive title and have not lost a World Cup game since the 2007 quarter-finals.\n\nEngland: 15-Elliot Daly, 14-Anthony Watson, 13-Manu Tuilagi, 12-Owen Farrell (captain) 11-Jonny May, 10-George Ford, 9-Ben Youngs, 8-Billy Vunipola, 7-Sam Underhill, 6-Tom Curry, 5-Courtney Lawes, 4-Maro Itoje, 3-Kyle Sinckler, 2-Jamie George, 1-Mako Vunipola.\n\nReplacements: 16-Luke Cowan-Dickie, 17-Joe Marler, 18-Dan Cole, 19-George Kruis, 20-Mark Wilson, 21-Willi Heinz, 22-Henry Slade, 23-Jonathan Joseph.", "description": "England coach Eddie Jones has recalled George Ford at flyhalf and shifted Owen Farrell to centre for Saturday's World Cup semi-final against New Zealand, reverting to his twin playmaker approach.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444417933&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0IV", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
