It also says anyone requiring an exception because of religious or other reasons must get a waiver.\n\nThe athletic association previously discussed dropping the waiver requirement for religious headwear, but the disqualification has now brought the issue to the forefront, said Tim Stried, a spokesman for the organization. Any change to the rule likely would be in place by next season, he said.\n\nAssociation officials have issued several waivers this fall and have never turned down such a request, Stried said. He also acknowledged that the rule isn\u2019t always fully enforced, including when it comes to wearing caps in cold weather.\n\nSimilar issues have come up in other states in recent years. The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association voted last year to drop its waiver requirement after a high school basketball player in Philadelphia was forced to leave a game because she was wearing a hijab.\n\nAbukaram, meanwhile, obtained a waiver this week and will be able to run in the state regional meet this weekend.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Noor Abukaram, 16, was disqualified from a race after posting her personal best time, because her coach hadn't got a waiver for her headwear", "authors": ["John Seewer"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ohio-athlete-hijab-disqualified.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
