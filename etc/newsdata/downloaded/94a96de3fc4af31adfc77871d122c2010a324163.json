But it doesn't mean that we will have an easy life,\" said Leclerc.\n\n\"I've only been to Suzuka once but it's a track I loved. It was just a really great experience, so I'm really looking forward to going back.\"\n\nThe Silver Arrows' unexpected one-two in Sochi means Mercedes can seal a record-equalling sixth successive constructors' championship this weekend if they manage to increase their lead over Ferrari by 14 points or more.", "description": "Lewis Hamilton may not be able to clinch a sixth world championship at the typhoon-threatened Japanese Grand Prix , but knows he can knock all but teammate Valtteri Bottas out of the title race.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7122/98eb945236eb4c5190ccf078378268cc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
