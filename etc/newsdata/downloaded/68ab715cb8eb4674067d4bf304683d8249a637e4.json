UPDATE 1-European stocks head for fourth week of gains post-ECB\n\n* STOXX 600 set for fourth straight weekly rise\n\n* Banks push euro zone stocks index higher\n\n* Trade tensions ease, concerns over growth linger\n\n* Deutsche Bank gains after U.S. settlement\n\n(Adds comments, updates price)\n\nBy Sagarika Jaisinghani and Susan Mathew\n\nSept 13 (Reuters) - European shares ground out gains for the\n\nfourth day running on Friday as signs of progress in U.S.-China\n\ntrade talks propped up shares after a mixed response to stimulus\n\nfrom the European Central Bank a day earlier.\n\nECB chief Mario Draghi told governments to do more to revive\n\nan ailing euro zone economy as he cut rates deeper into negative\n\nterritory and pledged indefinite monetary stimulus, tying the\n\nhands of his successor for years to come and initially driving\n\nstock markets higher. Bank stocks , which wavered after the decision, rose\n\non Friday, with analysts citing the ECB's easing of the terms of\n\nits long term loans to banks and the introduction of a tiered\n\ndeposit rate as offsetting the pain of negative rates.\n\n\"By exempting a significant chunk of bank deposits from the\n\nnegative deposit rate and making its offer of long-term\n\nliquidity for banks even more generous, the ECB is mitigating\n\nthe impact of a negative deposit rate on bank balance sheets,\"\n\nsaid Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg.\n\n\"By lowering funding costs further, it can make it easier\n\nfor governments to finance a modest fiscal expansion and nudge\n\ncountries with some extra fiscal space to actually use it \u2013\n\nthink Germany.\"\n\nBoth the pan-European STOXX 600 index and the euro\n\nzone only index were higher after an hour's trade, but\n\nthe gains were muted and suggested investors may have had their\n\nfill after four weeks of gains that have indexes back near\n\nlevels last seen in July.\n\nConcerns linger about the extent to which the central bank's\n\nstimulus can boost economic growth or stop the euro zone's\n\nbiggest economy from slipping into recession. The Ifo institute\n\ncut its 2019 growth forecast for Germany on Thursday, predicting\n\na recession in the third quarter. \"On balance, this round of ECB policy easing is seen as\n\ngenerally growth-supportive at the margin, but may not\n\nsignificantly move the growth dial,\" said Selena Ling, Head of\n\nStrategy and Research at OCBC.\n\nTrade-reliant commodity-linked and automotive\n\nstocks were boosted by fresh indications that a\n\nprolonged trade war between the United States and China was\n\nthawing.\n\nAfter Beijing and Washington made tariff concessions to each\n\nother, U.S. President Donald Trump said he could consider an\n\ninterim trade deal with China ahead of high-level negotiations\n\nin October. The food & beverage index was the biggest decliner\n\non the STOXX 600 as investors continued to rotate out of\n\ndefensive stocks.\n\nRoche Holding was the biggest boost to the index as\n\nit reported positive data from a primary progressive MS (PPMS)\n\nstudy. French conglomerate Bollore Group was also among\n\nthe best performers after posting a 27% increase in first-half\n\ncore earnings. Deutsche Bank AG rose 1.6% after becoming the\n\nfirst of 16 financial services companies to resolve claims that\n\nit conspired to rig prices of bonds issued by Fannie Mae\n\nand Freddie Mac .", "description": "UPDATE 1-European stocks head for fourth week of gains post-ECB", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB0E0CQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
