In its place, Disney began providing Disability Access Service (DAS) cards, which could be used by special-needs guests to obtain a \u201creturn time\u201d for a popular ride \u2014 much like a FastPass \u2014 at which point the guests and those accompanying them would be allowed to enter without waiting.\n\nSNOW WHITE SHARES HEARTWARMING MOMENT WITH SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD AT DISNEY WORLD\n\nDisney reportedly changed the original policy after learning of people recruiting special-needs guests in order to help themselves skip the lines as well, per WFLA. A fact sheet for the DAS cards, provided by the Disney Parks Blog, appears to confirm this as the reason for the change.\n\nNow, after five years, a U.S. district judge has scheduled a February court date for a non-jury trial, the Orlando Sentinel reports.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nSupporters of the lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of a plaintiff identified only as \u201cA.L.\u201d, argue that Disney World\u2019s current policy, which allows special-needs visitors to return to a ride at a later time, may be hard for some visitors to physically achieve. They also claim it may be a difficult concept for other visitors to comprehend.\n\n\u201cThe disabled plaintiff is mentally and physically incapable of traveling across the park to the site of an attraction only to be told to come back later,\u201d said attorney Anthony Dogali, per court documents obtained by WFLA. \u201cThis experience will induce meltdowns in the large majority of persons with cognitive impairments.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nThe case will go to trial on Feb. 18 in Orlando. Dogali said he does not expect to settle with Disney before that time, according to the Sentinel.\n\nWhen reached for a comment, a representative for Disney Parks said the company has \"an unwavering commitment to providing an inclusive and accessible environment for all our guests. We fully comply with all ADA requirements and believe that the legal claims are without merit.\u201d\n\nA fact sheet concerning the DAS cards, shared by the Disney Parks Blog at the time of the policy change, had also explained the reason for the switch.\n\n\u201cDisney Parks is modifying the current Guest Assistance Card program, which provides access to attractions for guests with disabilities, so it can continue to serve the guests who truly need it,\u201d the parks wrote. \u201cThe new program is designed to provide the special experience guests have come to expect from Disney. It will also help control abuse that was, unfortunately, widespread and growing at an alarming rate.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nPreviously, the Walt Disney Company had filed a petition to stop trials for 30 lawsuits filed on behalf of parkgoers with severe autism from going to court. The plaintiffs claimed that the iconic theme parks\u2019 system of \u201cappointment times\u201d for those with disabilities failed to sufficiently accommodate their needs, often leading to upsetting \u201cmeltdowns,\u201d though Disney claims that factors responsible for triggering such \u201cmeltdowns\u201d were beyond their control.", "description": "The suit was originally filed in 2014, after the parks changed their policy allowing special-needs guests to skip the lines at rides and attractions.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/DisneyWorldCastleIstock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
