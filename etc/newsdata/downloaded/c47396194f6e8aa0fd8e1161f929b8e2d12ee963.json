Whoop whoop! Reaching yet another milestone, because the babies now have a 95% chance of survival if they are born prematurely.\n\nThe babies are the size of an eggplant and are putting on layers of fat as they continue to grow.\n\nThey also move more frequently throughout the day and make fists/bumps against my tummy. It\u2019s so cute to see, but also weird at the same time.\n\n'They thought the nurse wanted to play hide and seek'\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been struggling with low iron levels for the past three weeks. This has resulted in me feeling dizzy coupled with no energy at times.\n\nAccording to my gynae, if my iron levels should stay this low, my healing process after the babies\u2019 birth could take much longer than expected.\n\nAfter a consultation, my gynae scheduled an intravenous iron infusion as it\u2019s crucial that my iron levels increase.\n\nHe said getting the iron delivered directly into my bloodstream will increase my haemoglobin levels quicker as opposed to increasing the dosage of my iron tablets.\n\nTime is also not on our side to increase the dosage of my iron tablets, as we\u2019re in the final stretch now. The iron infusion was a once-off session, and it took six hours to complete.\n\nIt went well, except the baby monitoring.\n\nMy three munchkins didn\u2019t always want to play along. I think they thought the nurse wanted to play hide and seek because as soon as she thought she had all three heartbeats, the one would disappear, only to reappear after a while (haha).\n\nMy gynae reassured me that we should be able to see a difference in my iron levels in two weeks.\n\n'The doctor burst out laughing'\n\nIn my last blog, I forgot to mention how Nikolai reacted when he went with me to the gynae. Just as the doctor started the session, he excitedly told my sister that we\u2019re going to see the babies on the doctor\u2019s TV.\n\nJust as the doctor showed him his first sibling, he excitedly asked where the baby\u2019s penis is, I mean really? The doctor burst out laughing and showed it to him.\n\nWhen he saw his sister, he wanted to know where her teeth were, to which the doctor smiled and replied that she doesn\u2019t have any yet.\n\nWhen we moved on to the third baby, I could see that Nikolai was feeling a bit overwhelmed as he sat in silence and quietly watched the doctor measuring the baby.\n\nAfter the scan, he was excited again when the doctor handed him the sonar photos. Nikolai asked me if the doctor said the babies are pretty. Of course, I said yes. Rule number one of being a parent \u2013 never lie to your kids!\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t! Guess he\u2019s slowly adjusting to the idea of three siblings, and not two.\n\n'I did not suspect a thing'\n\nOn the flip side, my colleagues surprised me with a baby shower at work.\n\nI thought I was attending a meeting to do my final handover and did not suspect a thing when I arrived at work.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a Springbok themed baby shower, and we received the cutest little Springbok rugby jerseys and Springbok mascots.\n\nNicolyn is of course super chuffed with the gifts and is already talking about a photoshoot. Now I just need to find myself a Springbok t-shirt otherwise I\u2019ll be the odd one out! This is officially my last week working from home.\n\nMy maternity leave starts on Monday. And I STILL need to start with my list of things I need! Let\u2019s just blame it on the preggie brain.\n\nThe weight of my preggy belly is getting heavier by the week, and the pain in my lower back has become real. Nowadays you\u2019ll always find me sitting, more often than usual.\n\nBut overall, we\u2019re healthy, and everything is going well.\n\nUntil next time!\n\nA-Bundlely Blessed and me.\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
