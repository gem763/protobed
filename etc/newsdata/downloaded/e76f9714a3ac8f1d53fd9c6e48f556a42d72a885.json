He was then shown a red card.\n\nFiorentina claimed that the move which led to Lazio\u2019s 89th minute winner began with a foul by Jordan Lukaku on Riccardo Sotil and were baffled as to why the referee did not review the incident on the pitchside monitor \u2014 instead relying on a silent check with VAR officials.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he go and have a look?\u201d asked Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Montella. \u201cIt\u2019s very serious if the referee does not have a look in a key episode.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all stood around for four minutes waiting for the VAR to say if he should see it or not. If he\u2019d only gone and looked at it, it would\u2019ve been a minute or two longer, but at least we\u2019d all be sure.\u201d\n\nNO END IN SIGHT TO MILAN\u2019S MISERY\n\nAC Milan\u2019s 2-1 defeat to AS Roma left the seven-times European champions stuck in 12th place with 10 points from nine games, only three clear of the relegation zone.\n\n\u201cWe made some incredible mistakes,\u201d said coach Stefano Pioli who was in charge of his second game after replacing Marco Giampaolo and said his team had taken a step backwards compared to their 2-2 draw with Lecce the week before.\n\n\u201cWe lacked lucidity and concentration because we should have held on for the draw.\n\n\u201cWe have to work on many aspects, we have to do more,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cPlenty of Roma\u2019s chances came from our mistakes where we made poor passes and failed to keep possession. Losing the ball in certain parts of the pitch can be dangerous and that is something we have to change.\u201d\n\nIT WAS ALL GOING SO WELL \u2014 UNTIL WE CONCEDED SEVEN GOALS\n\nUdinese coach Igor Tudor made a surprising claim after his side\u2019s 7-1 loss to Atalanta, saying their performance in the opening stages of the game was their best all season.\n\nTudor said the whole game hinged on Nicholas Opoku\u2019s sending off in the 32nd minute when the score was 1-1.\n\n\u201cThe game was divided into two,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the first part, I saw the best Udinese of the season.\n\n\u201cI liked the game so much at the beginning, including our interpretation of it,\u201d added the Croatian. \u201cThen what happened, happened \u2014 but we turn the page and go on\u201d.\n\nTRAORE BECOMES FIRST PLAYER BORN IN 2002 TO SCORE IN SERIE A\n\nThere was a small piece of history in the same match as Atalanta\u2019s Amad Traore became the first player born in 2002 or later to score a goal in Serie A.\n\nThe 17-year-old Ivorian, who usually plays for Atalanta\u2019s youth team, was brought on for his professional debut during the second half and scored within six minutes. \u201cThis goal will stay in my head,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope to carry on like this.\u201d\n\nQUAGLIARELLA DRAWS ANOTHER BLANK\n\nSampdoria striker Fabio Quagliarella, Serie A\u2019s top scorer last season as the age of 36, has scored only once in this campaign and drew another blank in the 2-1 defeat to Bologna which left his side rooted to the bottom of the table with three points.\n\n\u201cHe put in a lot of effort and if he continues like this, the goals will start coming,\u201d said coach Claudio Ranieri.", "description": "Five talking-points from the weekend's matches in Serie A:", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
