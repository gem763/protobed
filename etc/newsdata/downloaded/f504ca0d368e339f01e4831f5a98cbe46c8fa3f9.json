But a separate report showed business activity in the U.S. private sector picked up in September.\n\nThe reports highlighted a dynamic that many investors say has kept them cautiously optimistic about stocks this year. Even as global growth has been slowing, the U.S. economy has remained relatively resilient. That has convinced many money managers that U.S. stocks still have room to climb, despite uncertainties like the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and a weakening global economy.\n\n\"It looks like we're in a slowdown, but that slowdown won't become a recession yet,\" said Sandip Bhagat, chief investment officer of Whittier Trust, adding he took reassurance from strong labor market data, a robust service sector and still benign inflationary pressures.\n\nMr. Bhagat also said he wasn't expecting the U.S. economy to tip into recession anytime in 2019 or 2020.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 14.92 points, or 0.1%, to 26949.99 after rising as many as 76 points at one point in the trading session.\n\nThe S&P 500 declined 0.29 point, or less than 0.1%, to 2991.78 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 5.21 points, or 0.1%, to 8112.46.\n\nChanges in analyst ratings drove swings among individual stocks Monday, with American Airlines losing 49 cents, or 1.8%, to $27.50 after Bank of America analysts cut their rating for the stock to \"neutral\" from \"buy.\"\n\nRoku fell 68 cents, or 0.6%, to $107.37, extending losses after worries about competition in the streaming-media devices industry sent the stock tumbling the prior week.\n\nNetflix fell $4.83, or 1.8%, to $265.92, ending with a negative year-to-date percentage change for the first time since November 2016, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Its shares had been up 44% at their peak in 2019, but they have struggled since the firm reported a drop in subscribers at the end of its second quarter.\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 retreated 0.8% and German government-bond yields slipped further below zero.\n\nChinese shares fell after a canceled trip by Chinese negotiators to farms in Montana raised doubts about progress on U.S.-China trade talks. President Trump also late last week rejected suggestions the U.S. would accept a partial trade agreement with China, saying his administration is \"looking for a complete deal.\"\n\n\"I think this is the case of, well, we had the promise of more talks but where do we go from here?\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading firm IG Group.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index closed nearly 1% lower, while its smaller Shenzhen counterpart fell slightly more than 1%.\n\n\"The farm visit news was certainly a factor but having said that, investors' expectations for a quick resolution had been pretty low in the first place,\" said Zhang Gang, senior analyst at Central China Securities, saying the declines were relatively limited by Chinese standards.\n\nTwists and turns on the trade front aside, the Chinese central bank's decision to hold a key medium-term interest rate steady last week has continued to weigh on sentiment, Mr. Zhang said.\n\n\"There are few signs that the authorities will significantly loosen monetary policy in the near term,\" he added.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.8% after another weekend of protests. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was closed for a holiday, and South Korea's Kospi was flat.\n\nShen Hong and Joseph Wallace contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 23, 2019 16:42 ET (20:42 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
