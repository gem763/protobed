Just in the last three weeks, UNICEF reports, three children, along with two women were killed when a car was hit a highway 16 kilometres from Tripoli: three sisters and their mother a fourth sister injured when their home south of the capital was hit by a rocket, while a 13 year old child lost her life and five others were injured when their school was hit by shellfire in the town of Janzour, 18 kilometres from Tripoli.\n\nEight years after the death of Muammar Gaddafi Libya is in a state of unending strife. Haftar, a former general who had defected from regime forces, and has now promoted himself to Field Marshal, is backed by the UAE, Egypt, Russia, and it is claimed, covertly by France. Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj\u2019s Government of National Accord (GNA) is supported by the UN and the Italians, the former colonial power in Libya which has been the most constant Western presence in Libya since the war, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s Turkey.\n\nThe US also officially supports the Sarraj government, but Donald Trump is accused of giving green light to Haftar in a phone call in April as his Libyan National Army launched an assault on Tripoli.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The situation in Libya is expected to feature in talks between Nato foreign ministers next month and the leaders\u2019 summit in London in December.\n\nAmnesty International visited both sides of the conflict in and around Tripoli, Tajoura, Ain Zara, Qasr Bin Ghashir and Tarhouna and interviewed 156 residents, including attack survivors, witnesses and relatives of victims, and local officials, medical workers and members of militias.\n\nThe report stated \u201csome of the attacks documented were either indiscriminate or disproportionate \u2013 meaning they violated fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and could amount to war crimes. In other cases, the presence of fighters at or near civilian homes and medical facilities endangered civilians there. Children as young as two years old playing outside their homes, mourners attending a funeral, and ordinary people going about their daily activities were among those unlawfully killed or injured.\u201d\n\nAmnesty lists examples of attacks on civilians by both sides. Haftar\u2019s Libyan National Army (LNA) carried out a rocket attack, it says, in Tripoli\u2019s Abu Salim district on 16th April in which \u201csalvo of six notoriously inaccurate ground-launched \u201cGrad\u201d rockets rained down over several city blocks, killing eight civilians, injuring at least four more, and leaving the survivors badly traumatized\u201d the report states.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

What can we do? May God help us,\u201d one woman told the human rights group. Her husband, a 56-year-old father of six, was killed when a rocket struck his own bedroom where he was resting after returning home from playing football.\n\nA GNA artillery attack \u201con the densely populated civilian neighbourhood of Qasr bin Ghashir at on 14 May 2019, hit a three-storey building, killing at least five civilians and injuring more than a dozen. Many people were moving about the area at the time to attend the funeral of a well-known neighbour.\u201d\n\nI was at home and my brother was standing outside on the street. The strike was massive; it sent a vehicle flying on top of another vehicle and for a moment everything was black. I rushed outside and there were many neighbours dead and injured on the ground; there were severed body parts. It was a shocking sight. Then we found my brother; he had injuries everywhere; he died. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said the brother of 19-year-old Ahmad Fathi al-Muzughi, who died in the strike.\n\nMitiga Airport is now closed after being repeatedly targeted by LNA attacks. Nearby civilian homes and a school have also been struck in what appear to be indiscriminate attacks, says the report. Craters and munitions fragments at several of these strike sites, pointing to the use of unguided, large explosive weapons.\n\nLNA attacks have also damaged or destroyed several ambulances and field hospitals, says the report. Medical workers and facilities \u2013 including those treating sick or wounded fighters \u2013 have special protection under international humanitarian law and should not be targeted. Amnesty claims that GNA fighters have used field hospitals and medical facilities for military purposes, thereby rendering them vulnerable to attacks.\n\nA missile strike on a field hospital near the closed Tripoli International Airport on 27 July 2019 killed five medics and rescuers and injured eight more. Based on Blue Arrow 7 munition fragments found at the site and other evidence, Amnesty analysts hold that the strike was launched from a Chinese Wing Loong drone \u2013 which the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been operating on behalf of the LNA.\n\nBrian Castner, Amnesty International\u2019s Senior Crisis Adviser on Arms and Military Operations said: \u201cScores of civilians have been killed and injured as both sides use everything from Gaddafi-era unguided rockets to modern drone-launched guided missiles in attacks that could amount to war crimes. The international community must uphold the UN arms embargo, which Turkey, the UAE, Jordan and other countries have flagrantly violated.\u201d\n\nDonatella Rovera, Senior Crisis Response Adviser, added: \u201cThe-ground investigation revealed a systematic disregard for international law fuelled by the continued supply of weapons to both sides in violation of a UN arms embargo.\u201d\n\nTed Chaiban, Unicef\u2019s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa said: \u201cThese recent attacks are a reminder that children in Libya continue to pay first and most as violence continues in a number of areas in the western parts of the country. Children are not a target and should be protected at all times wherever they are. Parties to the conflict must refrain from attacks on civilian infrastructure including people\u2019s homes, schools, hospitals and medical facilities.\u201d", "description": "The opposing sides in Libya\u2019s civil war, backed by their foreign state sponsors, are carrying out indiscriminate attacks on civilians, using high-explosive weapons in heavily populated\u00a0areas, in what is likely to be war crimes, according to Amnesty International.", "authors": ["Kim Sengupta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/30/16/libya-haftar-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
