Let\u2019s explore the future of match-matching for a new generation of singles.\n\nJust days ago, reports surfaced that Match Group had wrapped filming on an apocalypse-themed, choose-your-own-adventure series to stream on the Tinder app. Today, the company officially announced it\u2019s launching Swipe Night, an interactive, choose-your-own-adventure-style streaming series targeting Gen Z users that will debut in the US next month.\n\nViewers will have the ability to swipe to move the story forward, and according to Tinder, it will then match users based on whatever terrible in-app decisions they make along the way.\n\n\u201cSwipe Night follows a group of friends played by Angela Wong Carbone (Chinatown Horror Story), Jordan Christian Hearn (Inherent Vice), and Shea Gabor, led by none other than you,\u201d Tinder said in a blog post.\n\n\u201cAs the story unfolds, you\u2019ll face moral dilemmas and practical choices, with only seven seconds to decide and no going back. After each Swipe Night story release, critical choices will be added to members\u2019 profiles, showing which decisions potential matches did or did not make. And all of this new information will make for plenty of material for post-apocalyptic banter.\u201d\n\nImage: Tinder\n\nThe company says the goal of Swipe Night is to facilitate natural conversations for Gen Z (Tinder claims that half its users are 18 to 25). Tinder chief executive Elie Seidman told The New York Times that its young users \u201cspeak in gifs, they react in emojis, they talk in stories\u201d.\n\nTinder\u2019s plan to engage its younger demographic with the series is clear in the talent attached to the project. Beyond the cast, Karena Evans, who has directed music videos for Drake, directed Swipe Night.\n\nBut setting aside for a moment that we are almost certainly being trolled by our own unhinged simulation prison, this Gen Z spin on \u201cNetflix and chill\u201d seems like a potential recipe for disaster.\n\nTinder says that users will have only seven seconds to make a decision about how to proceed in Swipe Night, meaning impulsive decisions about so-described \u201ccritical choices\u201d will offer a whole new way for users to be assessed and judged if, as Tinder says, those choices are displayed on user profiles.\n\nFor example, the Times reports in-app decisions will range \u201cfrom the seemingly unimportant (how to best DJ a party) to the critical (whose life to save)\u201d. Who\u2019d you save?! Choose wisely or risk dying alone!\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest here. The chances that this thing facilitates a budding romance between anyone are close to zero. Like an innocuous Buzzfeed quiz about Nickelodeon in the \u201990s, this is just another way to cloak psychological profiling in the guise of a fun game.\n\nWhereas Facebook could probably guess how you\u2019re going to vote, Tinder is getting better at understanding whether you\u2019ll be a massive creep on the first date \u2014 and also how to better market to giant creeps.\n\nThe Times described a rough cut of the series\u2019 first episode as \u201creminiscent of J.J. Abrams\u2019s 2008 movie, Cloverfield\u201d, which sounds at least somewhat promising.\n\nAccording to Variety, Tinder\u2019s match-making (or breaking!) streaming series had a budget of more than $US5 million ($7 million), a good chunk of change to spend on manufacturing conversation points for people who evidently have nothing to say to each other.\n\nThere's been no word regarding if or when Swipe Night will come to Australia, but the series will premiere in the US on October 6 at 6:00PM local time and will be live until midnight. A new episode will appear at the same time on Sundays thereafter.\n\nGod, I feel old.", "description": "Gather \u2019round, fellow olds.
