Hospital trade groups, medical centers and their employees are major political donors, contributing to whichever party holds power \u2014 and often to the out-of-power party as well. In 2018, PACs associated with the Greater New York Hospital Association, and individuals linked to it, gave $4.5 million to the Democrats\u2019 Senate Majority PAC and $1 million to their House Majority PAC. Its chief lobbyist personally gave nearly a quarter of a million dollars to dozens of campaigns last year.\n\nSenator Sanders has called on his competitors for the Democratic nomination to follow his lead and reject contributions from pharma and insurance. Can any candidate do the same for hospitals? The campaign committees of all 10 candidates participating in the upcoming Democratic debate have plentiful donations linked to the hospital and health care industry, according to Open Secrets.\n\nBut the symbiosis between hospitals and politicians operates most insidiously in the subtle fueling of each other\u2019s interests. Zack Cooper, a health economist at Yale, and his colleagues looked at this life cycle of influence by analyzing how members of Congress voted for a Medicare provision that allowed hospitals to apply to have their government payments increased. Hospitals in districts of members who voted yea got more money than hospitals whose representatives voted nay, to the collective tune of $100 million. They used that money to hire more staff and increase payroll. They also spent millions lobbying to extend the program.\n\nMembers who voted yea in turn received a 25 percent increase in total campaign contributions and a 65 percent increase in contributions from individuals working in the health care industry in their home states. It was a win-win for both sides.\n\nTo defend their high prices, medical centers assert that they couldn\u2019t afford to operate on Medicare payments, which are generally lower than what private insurers pay. But the argument isn\u2019t convincing.\n\nThe cost of a hospital stay in the United States averaged $5,220 a day in 2015 \u2014 and could be as high as over $17,000, compared with $765 in Australia. In a Rand study published earlier this year, researchers calculated that hospitals treating patients with private health insurance were paid, overall, 2.4 times the Medicare rates in 2017, and nearly three times the rate for outpatient care. If the plans had paid according to Medicare\u2019s formula, their spending would be reduced by over half.\n\nMost economists think hospitals could do just fine with far less than they get today from private insurance.", "description": "It\u2019s easy to criticize pharmaceutical and insurance companies.
