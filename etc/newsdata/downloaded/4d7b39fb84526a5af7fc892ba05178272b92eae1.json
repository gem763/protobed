But the White House said the House is operating without any rules, and, until it writes guidelines that are fair to all sides, the president and his team won\u2019t play ball.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and his administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process. Your unprecedented actions have left the President with no choice,\u201d White House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and three Democratic committee chairmen. \u201cIn order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the executive branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\u201d\n\nHe said the Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort seems less an attempt to defend the Constitution and more an effort \u201cto overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen.\u201d\n\nHis eight-page letter is so far administration\u2019s most scathing and thorough rebuttal to the inquiry, all but daring House Democrats to advance articles of impeachment.\n\nThe letter capped a day fast-moving development on Capitol Hill that saw Mr. Trump on Twitter call the probe \u201ca totally compromised kangaroo court,\u201d and Mrs. Pelosi return fire, accusing the president of \u201cobstructing justice, abusing power and diminishing the office of the presidency.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the intelligence committee and one of the three chairmen who was sent the eight-page letter, say obstructing their inquiry would itself constitute grounds for impeachment.\n\nThe White House said it\u2019s tried to cooperate \u2014 most notably by releasing the text of the president\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which was the subject of a whistleblower complaint.\n\nThe transcript showed Mr. Trump ask for an investigation of corruption involving 2020 Democratic presidential frontrunner Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter, who had a high-paying job on the board of a Ukraine gas company while his father was vice president. The transcript did not, however, show the president threaten to withhold U.S. military aid unless Mr. Zelensky complied, as the whistleblower alleged.\n\n\u201cNever before in our history has the House of Representatives \u2014 under the control of either political party \u2014 taken the American people down the dangerous path you seem determined to pursue,\u201d Mr. Cipollone wrote.\n\n\u201cYour highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people,\u201d he said in the letter, addressed to Mrs. Pelosi, Mr. Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York and House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland.\n\nDemocrats had hoped Mr. Sondland would be a star witness and shed light on whether the president used a $391 million military aid package as leverage to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nMr. Sondland reported directly to the president on Ukraine-U.S. relations.\n\nText messages turned over to Congress last week revealed that Mr. Sondland and another official wrote a statement for Mr. Zelensky expressing his commitment to investigate the Biden family.\n\nMr. Sondland was eager to testify, according to his lawyer.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill said they, too, had been eager to hear from the ambassador \u2014 though they said they expected him to back up Mr. Trump\u2019s claim there was no quid pro quo.\n\nThe GOP lawmakers said despite their disappointment, they agreed with the administration\u2019s move to block the ambassador\u2019s testimony at this point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s based on the unfair and partisan process that Mr. Schiff has been running,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican.\n\nMr. Jordan said Kurt Volker, another State Department official who testified last week, was treated poorly by the Democrats and they did not want to subject Mr. Sondland to the same treatment.\n\nHouse Republicans say if Democrats want to conduct an impeachment inquiry they should hold a vote in the full House and write rules to govern the proceedings, such as rules for sharing evidence, calling witnesses and granting access to the president\u2019s team.\n\nThose were all standard features of past impeachment inquiries, Republicans said, but Democrats have not embraced them this time around.\n\nMrs. Pelosi, who unilaterally declared the impeachment probe last month, has brushed aside Republicans\u2019 suggestions on how to achieve a fair probe. Yet she\u2019s also wary of her new majority being defined by the push for impeachment. In a letter to her Democratic troops on Tuesday she urged them to continue to talk about legislation they hope to pass.\n\n\u201cWe must legislate strongly, investigate fairly and litigate strategically,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile Senate Republicans, who have the majority in the upper chamber, vowed to use their platform to balance the House\u2019s one-sided inquiry.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said he would allow Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, to come before his committee to discuss the \u201cdisturbing allegations\u201d of corruption in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cGiven the House of Representatives\u2019 behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,\u201d tweeted Mr. Graham, South Carolina Republican.\n\n\u2981 Gabriella Mu\u00f1oz and Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
