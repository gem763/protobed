It's important that people understand vaping does create health risks.\"\n\nThere have been hundreds of such cases in the United States, but this is believed to be the first case of severe pulmonary illness linked to vaping in Canada.\n\n\"We know very little about the long-term health effects associated with e-cigarettes, but our findings so far are enough to convince us of the need to advise the public,\" Mackie said.\n\nMackie did caution that it's impossible to 100 per cent confirm the youth's illness was caused by vaping, but said there was no other evidence to suggest it was caused by something else.\n\nDr. Chris Mackie is the Middlesex-London Health Unit's medical officer of health. He said the use of vaping products is escalating. (Andrew Lupton/CBC)\n\n\"There was no other cause \u2014 no infectious cause,\" he said. \"The only issue identified is that the individual vaped e-cigarettes.\n\nThe health unit says it will not disclose the age, gender or hometown of the patient, claiming confidentiality.\n\nThe news comes on the same day as the Ontario health minister ordered public hospitals to report vaping-related cases of severe pulmonary disease.\n\nUse 'escalating' among youth\n\nIt also follows a directive from Health Canada to health-care professionals, telling them to ask patients about their vaping use and if they have any trouble breathing or shortness of breath.\n\n\"The use of these products is escalating at a rate we've never seen,\" said Linda Stobo, the Middlesex-London Health Unit's manager of chronic disease prevention and tobacco control team. \"Our enforcement officers have seen an exponential increase in the number of students who vape, particularly high school-aged youth, which is a major concern for us.\"\n\nStobo said the e-cigarettes are marketed in a way that targets a young demographic including:\n\nSleek designs with options to customize the look, including different colours.\n\nHundreds of flavours of e-juice, including candy, designed to attract youth.\n\nMarketing that uses words such as \"bold,\" \"stylish,\" \"attractive\" and \"try it.\"\n\nSome vaping devices can be charged using a computer or cellphone charger, making them enticing to a generation already enamoured with technology.\n\nStobo also said she's worried about the high concentrations of nicotine found in some of the products. She also said local schools are reporting students vaping in washrooms, classrooms and even buses.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau made a brief stop in Salisbury NB on Wednesday 0:53\n\nSelling vaping products to those under 18 isn't allowed in Canada, but Health Canada wants to strengthen rules to limit the visibility of vaping ads to young people.\n\nSome proponents of vaping insist it can be an effective way to prevent people from smoking tobacco, or a way to help smokers quit cigarettes.\n\nMackie, however, said it can often work the other way. That someone not interested in smoking may start with vaping then transfer over to cigarettes because they're cheaper.\n\n\"If you start people on smoking e-juice \u2026 then when they run out of money the smoking behaviour starts up,\" he said.\n\nIn the United States, there have been hundreds of cases of respiratory illnesses linked to vaping and at least seven deaths. Many of those deaths were linked to vaping cannabis. Mackie wouldn't say whether cannabis was a factor in the London, Ont., case.\n\n\"The information we have \u2026 is that there's no particular brand that has been implicated, and there's no particular link with cannabis or not,\" he said. \"There are cases where cannabis has been involved and cases where it hasn't been.\n\nIndia on Wednesday moved to ban the production, import and sale of electronic cigarettes.\n\nHowever, the London-Middlesex case is believed to be the first reported in Canada.", "description": "An Ontario teenager was put on life support after using a vaping device in what public health officials say is the first reported\u00a0case of illness linked to the practice in Canada.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3218408.1441652476!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/electronic-cigarette.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
