(Yuri Smityuk/TASS)\n\nThe Draconids meteor shower could set the night sky ablaze with shooting stars as it peaks tonight and tomorrow night.\n\nThe annual meteor shower brings with it a chance to get out and see shooting stars form across the night sky \u2013 providing the weather doesn\u2019t interfere.\n\nSometimes as many as 1,000 shooting stars per hour are on display during the Draconid shower, however in reality it\u2019s likely to be more like five or six that you can actually spot. The rest may be too small or fast to see without specialist equipment.\n\nSadly, the Draconids is one of the least interesting meteor showers of the year. Probably because it\u2019s so unpredictable.\n\n\u2018The Draconids are one of those showers where you either see a bunch of them or none of them,\u2019 Bill Cooke, a meteor expert with Nasa, told Space.com. It\u2019s the first of two meteor showers this month, with the Orionidsset to strike towards the end of October.\n\nThe Draconids may only offer up five or six meteors per hour (AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe meteors will come from the direction of the Draco the dragon, the constellation from which they took their name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn really lucky years, there might be a \u2018burst\u2019 of hundreds of thousands of shooting stars falling every hour from the dragon\u2019s head \u2013 known as the dragon \u2018awakening\u2019. In 2011, for example, stargazers in Europe were treated to six hundred an hour.\n\n\u2604\ufe0f The #Draconids are named after the constellation Draco the Dragon as this is the direction from which they appear to originate. To view the Draconids from the UK, head outside after sunset on 9 October.
