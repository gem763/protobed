According to a filing Apple submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, Iger resigned on September 10, coinciding with the company\u2019s annual iPhone extravaganza, which also revealed important details about its Apple TV+ service.\n\nEvery Major Aussie Streaming Service Compared With Disney+ and Apple TV+ on the way to Australia, the streaming service market is about to get a whole lot more busy.

A similar incident occurred in 2009 when Google CEO Eric Schmidt distanced himself from Apple after it became clear that Android would be going head-to-head with the iPhone.\n\nIn a statement to multiple outlets Friday, Apple described Iger as an \u201cexemplary\u201d and a \u201crole model for an entire generation of business leaders.\u201d", "description": "Disney CEO Bob Iger has bowed out of Apple\u2019s board of directors ahead of what\u2019s sure to be a heated competition come November when both companies release their dueling standalone streaming services.
