I\u2019ve adopted a basic uniform of black sneakers, black Levi\u2019s jeans, a black T-shirt, a black sweater, and colorful earrings. This has served me well despite a few comments from my students (for a writing assignment called \u201cI Remember,\u201d based on Joe Brainard\u2019s book of the same name, one student wrote, \u201cI remember wondering why Professor Phillips wears black all the time\u201d). The answer is that I have about 90 seconds to get dressed in the morning rush each day, and I don\u2019t want to have to think about what I\u2019m putting on.\n\nBut sticky New York weather present a challenge. Who wants to pull on black jeans in high humidity? Yet I couldn\u2019t come up with a warm-weather uniform that enabled me to get dressed quickly and without a thought.\n\nThen a couple of years ago, my sister passed along to me a jumper made by Nooworks. It was a light fabric. It was a single, simple garment. And yes: It featured growling cheetahs on a purple background. Nooworks\u2019 bold, bright fabrics are the opposite yet somehow fitting counterpart to my monochrome non-summer uniform.\n\nThese jumpers make other women smile. Compliments and inquiries rain down upon the wearer. I pretty much can\u2019t leave the house without a woman trying to buy them off my body.\n\nThis leads me to believe we are all quietly wishing for one-piece pants-oriented garments that make us feel well-dressed with almost no effort \u2014 a desire that Nooworks (\u201ca woman-owned, women-run business\u201d based in San Francisco that makes \u201climited-edition textiles with artists we love\u201d) clearly understands.\n\nThe $148 price tag seemed steep to me at first, but when I just rotate among Nooworks jumpers all summer long for multiple summers, it starts to feel fairly cost-effective. On my six-week book tour this summer, I brought no fewer than four Nooworks jumpers. But I didn\u2019t have to pack much else.\n\nNooworks Jumpers I Own (That Are Still in Stock)\n\nPlus Other Strategist-Approved Jumpsuits and Overalls\n\nFive Rock Poplin Short-Sleeve Unlined Coveralls Regular Fit This is Strategist editor Maxine Builder\u2019s favorite inexpensive and versatile jumpsuit, about which she wrote, \u201cMy affection for the piece has reached the point where I actually feel a little lost when I reach for the jumpsuit in the morning only to remember that it\u2019s in the wash.\u201d From $42 at Amazon Buy From $42 at Amazon Buy\n\nLove Cotton Hulaha Women's Linen Loose-Fit Overalls Writer Kira Fisher is happy to report that upon ordering these linen overalls, they did not make her feel like an overgrown toddler: \u201cThe material was breezy-thin but durable, it moved nicely with my body without constraining it, and the pockets were not just decorative but functional (the perfect size for a work ID, a couple of pens, and my iPhone).\u201d $27 at Amazon Buy $27 at Amazon Buy\n\nEverlane Japanese GoWeave Essential Jumpsuit This machine-washable Everlane jumpsuit is technically Cut-approved.
