REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s frustration over the failure of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign to unseat Maduro has spurred foreign policy aides to ready further U.S. actions and press for tougher sanctions on OPEC member Venezuela by European and Latin American partners, a second senior administration official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nAbrams said Washington sees Cuba and Russia providing a lifeline to Maduro, nine months after the Trump administration and dozens of other countries resolved to no longer recognize the socialist leader as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking to ways to squeeze (Cuba) because we do not see any improvement in their conduct either with respect to Venezuela or human rights internally,\u201d Abrams said in an interview in his State Department office.\n\nThe new sanctions under consideration for communist Cuba, expected \u201cin the weeks ahead,\u201d would likely target the island\u2019s tourism sector as well as Venezuela\u2019s cut-rate oil delivered to Havana, building on the U.S. blacklisting of tankers used to transport the supplies, the senior official said.\n\nWhile U.S. sanctions on Cuba stem from accusations that it provides training, arms and intelligence to Maduro\u2019s security forces, targeting Russia would be based heavily on Moscow\u2019s financial support of Caracas. Oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) has helped Venezuela market its crude since Washington imposed sanctions on state oil company PDVSA in January.\n\nAsked whether Washington is preparing sanctions against Rosneft, Abrams said the administration was \u201ctaking a closer look at the ways in which Russia is sustaining the regime\u201d but declined to specify any entities or individuals.\n\nIn early August, the Trump administration froze U.S. assets of the Venezuelan government and threatened \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d on any company doing business with it, an escalation of pressure on Maduro. The move was widely seen as opening the door to putting sanctions on Rosneft, which in recent months has taken around half of Venezuela\u2019s crude exports.\n\nAbrams said the administration now intended to start \u201cnaming names\u201d under Trump\u2019s August order and that new individual sanctions are expected over the next three months.\n\nBut U.S. officials are mindful of the need for caution in targeting a company as large and far-reaching as Rosneft over its Venezuela ties.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of being haphazard,\u201d the senior administration official told Reuters, stressing that they were not specifically referring to Rosneft.\n\n\u201cIf it was a company that was solely doing business in Venezuela, that\u2019s a slam dunk. But when you deal with entities that have multiple components, we have to be thorough.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration recognizes the risk of adding tensions to an already-troubled U.S.-Russia relationship at a time when the countries face geopolitical disagreements over issues like Syria, Ukraine and arms control.\n\n\u2018WHY AREN\u2019T WE DOING MORE?\u2019\n\nWith some critics saying the economic weapons at the Trump administration\u2019s disposal are dwindling, it remains unclear whether the remaining options will be enough to shift the balance of power in Venezuela.\n\nMaduro retains the loyalty of the country\u2019s military despite opposition leader Juan Guaido\u2019s efforts to get them on his side after he invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election was a fraud. Guaido leads the opposition-controlled National Assembly.\n\nFurther restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba would be aimed at squeezing the island economically and expanding Trump\u2019s steady rollback of the historic opening to Cuba by Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama. The reversal, along with his pressure on Venezuela, has gone over well among Cuban Americans in South Florida, a key voting bloc in Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nThe senior administration official insisted Trump\u2019s growing impatience with the failure of sanctions and diplomatic pressure to push Maduro from power meant he would not ease up despite the president\u2019s decision last month to fire his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, who was widely identified with the hardline policy on Venezuela.\n\nThe official said that before the administration stepped up pressure in January as Guaido assumed the rival presidency, the process had been hampered by two years of \u201cslow-walking\u201d by other government agencies that preferred an incremental approach.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the frustration that the president harbored - he\u2019d been saying for two years, \u2018Why aren\u2019t we doing more?\u2019,\u201d the official said.\n\nHowever, a former senior U.S. official said the administration underestimated the complexities of the Venezuelan situation, especially the difficulty of spurring a mutiny in the ranks where many officers are suspected of benefiting from corruption and drug trafficking.\n\nAsked whether Venezuela policy would change with Bolton\u2019s departure, Abrams said: \u201cThe policy of supporting Guaido, supporting the National Assembly, pushing for a return of democracy, is not going to change.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration is preparing new sanctions on Cuba over its support for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and is taking a \"closer look\" at Russia's role in helping him remain in power, the U.S. special envoy on Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, told Reuters.", "authors": ["Matt Spetalnick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438936503&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981RQ", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
