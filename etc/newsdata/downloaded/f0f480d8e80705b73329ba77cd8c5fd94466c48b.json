Now they want to impeach a president over this? It\u2019s looking more and more like it\u2019s just \u2026 very much a partisan attack.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) in a Monday interview on \"Fox & Friends\" called for an investigation into the three Democratic senators who threatened to | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/senator-rand-paul-7-18-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
