The majority of institutions\u201483 percent\u2014that participated in the Institute of International Education\u2019s 2017\u201318 survey cited the delay or denial of student visas as a factor contributing to the decline.\n\nAnother president at the dinner, Philip A. Glotzbach of Skidmore College, said that while his liberal-arts school in Saratoga Springs, New York, hasn\u2019t yet experienced a decline in international students, it has had to \u201cwork a lot harder\u201d to recruit and retain them. Barbara K. Altmann, the president of Franklin & Marshall College, said that the \u201clatest diplomatic skirmish about visas\u201d\u2014combined with political tensions abroad\u2014has compelled her school, too, to \u201ctake extraordinary measures \u2026 so international students know [they\u2019re welcome here].\u201d One in five students at the Lancaster, Pennsylvania, liberal-arts institution comes from outside the U.S.\u2014most of them from China. So over the summer, Franklin & Marshall \u201cactivated a network\u201d of Chinese nationals affiliated with the college, including upperclassmen, asking them to send reassuring messages to incoming students and their families via social media and other platforms.\n\nRead: Should America\u2019s universities stop taking so many international students?\n\nMany of these visa obstacles, according to NAFSA: Association of International Educators, in part trace back to a memorandum issued in 2017 by President Donald Trump that called for the \u201cheightened screening and vetting of applications for visas and other immigration benefits\u201d as well as new or updated requirements for visa holders studying or working at U.S. colleges. For instance, changes implemented by the Trump administration last year made it more difficult for recent graduates with student visas to continue living in the country legally. Since then, international students\u2019 visa issues have created unprecedented workloads for many institutions, whose international-services offices traditionally focused on supporting students with, say, workshops about setting up American bank accounts, English-tutoring services, and basic visa-application guidance.\n\nBefore the presidents\u2019 dinner, The Atlantic reached out to numerous schools\u2014including several members of the Ivy League and an assortment of colleges with large populations of non-Americans\u2014to learn what it\u2019s like behind the scenes of their international-students offices. How, if at all, have these offices\u2019 responsibilities evolved in recent years? The 10 that responded described an increase in visa holdups for their international students since the Trump administration issued its directives, and a corresponding increase in work for schools.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the field for almost 20 years,\u201d Kristy Magner, who oversees Tulane University\u2019s Office of International Students and Scholars, said in an email, \u201cand the amount of immigration changes during the last three years has been exponential.\u201d (Non-Americans make up 6 percent of incoming freshmen this fall at Tulane, a highly selective research university in New Orleans.)", "description": "Amid tightening immigration restrictions, higher-education institutions find themselves swamped with paperwork.", "authors": ["Alia Wong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_161499725/facebook.jpg?1567630692", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
