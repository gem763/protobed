It is absolutely hurtful and disgusting.\n\n'Derogatory terms such as \"tranny\" and \"transsexual\" are not appropriate. For me, to listen to that interview, my heart actually broke. I grew up listening to her music.'\n\nOn Monday, Kate first used the slur on KIIS FM's The Kyle and Jackie O Show, before repeating it a few hours later on Studio 10 while discussing The Masked Singer.\n\n'I put on my best tranny voice': Kate used the offensive term on Studio 10 (pictured) and KIIS FM while explaining how she'd adopted a male-sounding voice on The Masked Singer\n\nActivist: Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Monday, Daniielle said, 'That word has put us down and made us inferior for so long, that people don't even think it is an insult'\n\nShe said on Kyle and Jackie O: 'The producers came to me [on] the first day and said, \"You sound way too much like you, is there any way you can help us along and modify your voice?\" So I put on my best tranny voice.'\n\nKate made a similar comment on Studio 10, when host Sarah Harris asked how she was able to conceal the distinctive sound of her voice.\n\n'I lowered my register and made myself sound like the tranny version of myself.'\n\nUnhappy: 'If you talk to any trans person and say \"tranny\", I can guarantee you they would be horrified.

That's what we need from celebrities.'\n\nFamiliar face: Daniielle is pictured on prison drama Wentworth in 2017 (right) with two co-stars\n\nHoping to raise awareness of unacceptable language, Daniielle added: 'We will not tolerate celebrities in Australia putting us down and calling us the wrong names.\n\n'As a trans activist in this country, my biggest point I want to get across is that trans people are people. Trans women are women, and trans men are men.\n\n'It is time that we are seen for who we are. And when you are in the spotlight, you need to learn the correct pronouns and the correct terminology.'\n\n'I actually did not realise': Following a fan backlash, Kate apologised on Instagram, saying: 'I am sending to all of my friends in the LGBTQ community a sincere apology for this morning'\n\nThe term 'tranny' is widely regarded as outdated, and is considered unacceptable for a non-trans person to say in any context.\n\nIn addition to being offensive, the word is often used in connection with transphobic attacks.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Kate's representatives for comment.", "description": "Transgender actress and activist\u00a0Daniielle Alexis has spoken out after\u00a0Kate Ceberano apologised for saying 'tranny' live on Studio 10 and KIIS FM on Monday.", "authors": ["Joshua Fox For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/01/20014130-0-image-a-36_1571704118866.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
