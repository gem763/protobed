They kept the ball in play as much as they could. Our boys are just not used to that,\u201d Russia\u2019s Welsh coach Lyn Jones said.\n\n\u201cTier one just isn\u2019t what we are used to - it\u2019s a different sport. We have prepared for a year for it to be as close as possible.\u201d\n\nThe Russians next take on Samoa on Sept 24, while Japan go up against the number one-ranked Irish in Fukuroi City on Sept 28 in a match the hosts will be desperate to win if they wish to progress to the quarter-finals for the first time.\n\nThey will need a much-improved performance to get anywhere close to what would be a stunning upset to rank with their win over South Africa at the 2015 World Cup.", "description": "Winger Kotaro Matsushima scored a hat-trick as Japan overcame a severe case of opening-night nerves to give the host nation a winning start to the Rugby World Cup with a 30-10 victory over a spirited Russia side on Friday.", "authors": ["Shinichi Saoshiro", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432026882&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1K4-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
