Mr. Steyer didn\u2019t say, but his call to pursue perpetrators of \u201cenvironmental crimes\u201d has upped the ante for 2020 Democratic candidates wooing the climate vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only candidate who will declare a climate emergency on day one and use the emergency powers of the president to address it,\u201d said Mr. Steyer.\n\nOur entire planet is facing a climate emergency. We must take swift action to confront it.\n\n\n\nA global problem will require a global solution. I am prepared to make climate change the center of my foreign policy. pic.twitter.com/Mj4V7brxIg \u2014 Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) September 27, 2019\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s biggest single donor in 2016, Mr. Steyer has spent heavily since entering the race July 9 to catch up with the rest of the field after devoting the previous year to his campaign to impeach President Trump.\n\nHis $12 million television and digital ad campaign paid off, helping him earn a slot on the October debate stage by reaching the 2% polling cut-off after falling to qualify for the September debates.\n\nWhile Mr. Steyer, the founder of NextGen Climate, has made the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d his central issue, he has encountered plenty of competition from other Democratic contenders, many of whom have already released multi-trillion-dollar Green New Deal proposals.\n\nThe Steyer campaign offered no financial estimate for his climate plan, which includes \u201cgreening\u201d the State and Defense departments by making non-combat operations carbon-neutral by 2030, although his proposals would undoubtedly run into the trillions.\n\nHis proposed Global Green New Deal Fund would commit $20 billion per year for 10 years to address \u201ccrimes\u201d such as the Amazon wildfires and the \u201cPacific Garbage Patch.\u201d\n\nEcocide is an Environmental Crime Against Humanity. @TomSteyer\u2019s new plan for global climate justice would make it official. https://t.co/KD3WH9K9Id pic.twitter.com/aKN2Hm6dfh \u2014 Dave Weiskopf (@daveregrets) September 27, 2019\n\nHe also called for creating a Climate Security Intelligence Center; quadrupling U.S. investment in clean energy; ending all American coal, oil and natural gas investment abroad, and stopping U.S. fossil-fuel exports.\n\nLike the other Green New Deals, the Steyer plan comes with a social-justice emphasis with goals such as ensuring \u201creproductive healthcare\u201d and \u201cfreedom from sexual violence and harassment,\u201d as well as adding youth representatives from all nations to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nThe plan would also increase the number of U.S. refugees by ensuring entry for those fleeing \u201cclimate related disasters and conflicts.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
