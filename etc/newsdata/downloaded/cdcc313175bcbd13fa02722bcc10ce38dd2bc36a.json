He was a surprise cut at the end of training camp this year.\n\nDuring training camp, the 30-year-old Marshall was spending time with the first-team defense alongside Tahir Whitehead and Vontaze Burfict. Burfict was handed a season-ending suspension by the NFL for another illegal hit earlier in the season.\n\nAlong with Burfict being out, the Raiders are without backup Marquel Lee, who is on injured reserve with an ankle injury. Undrafted rookie Justin Phillips, who suffered a knee injury in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Houston Texans, was waived to create a roster spot for Marshall.\n\nWe have signed LB Brandon Marshall.\n\nMore: https://t.co/Q7TLonUqRr @BMarshh pic.twitter.com/6IQlclTfph\u2014 Oakland Raiders (@Raiders) October 29, 2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re struggling at linebacker right now with Marquel Lee [hurt] and Vontaze\u2019s suspension,\u201d Raiders head coach Jon Gruden told reporters Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to probably be looking to shore up the linebacker position here in the next 48 hours.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to bring in another linebacker and train him. We have Dakota Allen, who didn\u2019t play yesterday, also on the team. We\u2019re thin. We have to add another linebacker, certainly. Hopefully Whitehead is ready to go. He came out of the game a little nicked up, too.\u201d\n\nThe Raiders will host the Detroit Lions on Sunday.", "description": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 The Oakland Raiders re-signed veteran linebacker Brandon Marshall, the team announced Tuesday.
