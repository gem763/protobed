Thirty years on, he enjoys the freedoms the fall of the Berlin Wall brought, but is not entirely happy either.\n\nMatthias Rudolph poses in front of Nikolai Kirche during a Reuters interview in Leipzig, Germany, October 15, 2019. REUTERS/Paul Carrel\n\nLike many Germans in the former East, Rudolph, 55, laments the way reunification unfolded - \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a new start\u201d - and describes a divided society today that he believes drives some disaffected easterners toward political extremism.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do away with the GDR but rather to reform it,\u201d said Rudolph, who was spied on by a colleague and detained for protesting as East Germany limped into its final months. \u201cPersonally, I wanted a different GDR, a more democratic GDR.\u201d\n\nThe Leipzig protests are widely seen as the beginning of the end of the GDR. Yet, almost 30 years after the Berlin Wall fell on Nov. 9, 1989, a psychological divide remains between east and west: easterners still feel they came off second best.\n\n\u201cThere was no reset,\u201d said Rudolph, who complained that reunification was a missed opportunity to remake Germany with a new constitution.\n\n\u201cFor west Germans, nothing changed other than post codes. For east Germans, everything changed,\u201d the energy company employee added.\n\nFor west Berlin resident Angelika Bondick, 63, whose flat looks over the former Bernauer Strasse checkpoint, the fall of the Wall brought more tourists but no major upheaval. In GDR times, she regularly visited family in the East anyway.\n\nIf the dismantling of the Wall signaled the end of the Cold War, it also opened up new routes to walk her dog.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice that we can walk in whichever direction we want now,\u201d she told Reuters from her balcony.\n\nThe East has endured far more upheaval.\n\nLate chancellor Helmut Kohl, the architect of reunification, promised east Germans \u201cflourishing landscapes\u201d in 1990 but the \u201cAufschwung Ost\u201d - or eastern economic recovery - proved far slower and more painful than he had imagined.\n\nTwo million people, especially young people and women, have left the region since reunification in 1990 and few big global firms have moved in.\n\nAfter cash injections of 2 trillion euros ($2 trillion) over three decades, the East\u2019s economic output per capita is still three quarters of western German levels. Productivity is lower, and unemployment 2 percentage points higher than in the west.\n\nA government report on the state of German unity last month cited a survey showing 57% of east Germans felt like second-class citizens. Only 38% in the East saw reunification as a success, including only 20% of people younger than 40.\n\nRudolph said he does not feel like a second class citizen.\n\nRelated Coverage From Alice in Wonderland to walking the dog: Germans recall fall of Berlin Wall\n\n\u201cBut it is also true that you always have to explain yourself. That\u2019s not nice either,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that would be over in a few years, but it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIlko-Sascha Kowalczuk, a historian and author of \u2018The Takeover - how East Germany became part of the Federal Republic\u2019, said the economic shock of reunification disrupted the whole social fabric of eastern Germany.\n\n\u201cThere was not a unification process on a level playing field but rather an alignment process ... what existed in the west was practiced in the east one-to-one,\u201d he said, adding that some easterners now felt they were not \u201cfull value citizens\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince 1990, many east Germans have been trying to be more German than the federal Germans ever were - and that results in an open nationalism and racism,\u201d Kowalczuk added.\n\n\u201cWE ARE THE PEOPLE!\u201d\n\nEasterners\u2019 sense of inferiority provides fertile ground for extreme parties. In the eastern state of Thuringia, which holds a regional election on Sunday, polls show a majority of voters support the far-right AfD and the far-left Linke.\n\nIn Thuringia and two other eastern states that held elections last month, the AfD has co-opted slogans that were used during the 1989 protests that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall, including \u201cWir sind das Volk!\u201d (We are the people!).\n\nThe AfD, which is far stronger in the east than the west, is urging voters: \u201cThe East rises - complete the change!\u201d\n\nAdopting the word \u201cWende\u201d, used to describe the fall of East German Communism, the AfD calls for \u201cWende 2.0\u201d - effectively urging voters to do away with the established parties in a \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d-style pitch.\n\nChristian Hirte, the government\u2019s commissioner for the eastern states, says: \u201cIt is my firm conviction that the overwhelming majority of eastern Germans do not want anything to do with far-right crackpots who are violent.\u201d\n\nBut he acknowledges that xenophobia is an issue damaging to eastern Germany\u2019s attractiveness as a business location.\n\n\u201cWe have to tell citizens clearly: it is in our own national and regional interests to be open,\u201d he said.\n\nThe message has not got through to everyone.\n\nA report by the ZEW institute earlier this year showed the probability of an asylum seeker becoming a victim of hate crime in eastern Germany is 10 times greater than in the west.\n\nImages like last year\u2019s far-right riots in Chemnitz \u2013 the worst such clashes in Germany in decades \u2013 and this month\u2019s attack on a synagogue in Halle by a far-right extremist have reinforced the picture of a disenchanted and radicalized east.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nIn the latest episode of far-right intimidation, police said this week they were protecting the leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives in Thuringia after he received a death threat that ended \u201cHeil Hitler!\u201d.\n\nThat kind of language is anathema to Dagmar Simdorn, 81, who grew up during World War Two and then lived in the GDR, just a few hundred yards from the Berlin Wall. She still notices differences between easterners and westerners.\n\n\u201cBut I think young people are doing better,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for them. They are growing up in this time of freedom. They don\u2019t know about East and West. That\u2019s why I believe it\u2019s so important to remind young people how things were then.\u201d", "description": "When Matthias Rudolph joined political protests in Leipzig in 1989, he wanted to change the Communist German Democratic Republic.
