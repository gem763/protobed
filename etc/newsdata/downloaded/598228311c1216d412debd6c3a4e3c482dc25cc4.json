(AP) - Over 30 bison roaming Grand Canyon National Park\u2019s northern reaches are joining a herd in Oklahoma.\n\nHundreds of the massive animals have made their home at the Grand Canyon in recent years, but park officials say they\u2019re spoiling water sources and harming the landscape.\n\nOfficials came up with a plan two years ago to reduce the herd partly by corralling the animals and shipping them elsewhere. Thirty-one bison loaded in multiple livestock trailers were shipped to the Quapaw Tribe in Oklahoma on Wednesday.\n\nSeveral other bison were fitted with tracking devices and released back into the park.\n\nThe bison are descendants of ones introduced to northern Arizona in the early 1990s as part of a crossbreeding experiment. The state allows them to be hunted on the neighboring national forest.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Over 30 bison roaming Grand Canyon National Park's northern reaches are joining a herd in Oklahoma.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
