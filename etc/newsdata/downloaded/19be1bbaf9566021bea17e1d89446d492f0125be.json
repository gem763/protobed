The move was first announced late last month as reports of vaping-related deaths and illnesses mounted across the country.\n\n\u201cThe vapor that users inhale can contain ultrafine particles, carcinogens, volatile organic compounds and heavy metals,\u201d said Public Health Service Capt. Kimberly Elenberg, director of Total Force Fitness for the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness. \u201cVaping is not harmless, and researchers are still trying to understand the long-term impacts and health effects from inhaling the vapor.\u201d\n\nWhile vaping products had been cast as a safer alternative to cigarettes and other more traditional items, military officials said the jury is still out on whether that\u2019s actually true.\n\n\u201cE-cigarettes generally contain less chemicals compared to traditional products like cigarettes, but since the long-term effects of vaping are unknown and not understood, there is not enough information at this time to make a determination on whether it is safer or healthier than other tobacco products,\u201d Capt.
