This has included falsely labeling allegations of Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election in favor of the Democrats as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and claiming as fact that Trump used military aid as part of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d with Ukraine.\n\nWikipedia editors have also labeled other legitimate concerns about impropriety in the Russia investigation as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and created several articles labeling them as such. They have also treated many claims against President Donald Trump and his administration as fact despite being treated only as allegations by the cited sources.\n\nSoon after the controversy over the Ukraine call began, editors began building up articles on the controversy and the resulting impeachment inquiry launched by Congressional Democrats. Both articles are viewed by thousands of people every day. Editors early on sought to spin the controversy by framing Trump\u2019s call as mainly pertaining to investigating Biden and his son\u2019s involvement in Ukrainian corruption, when it mostly concerned Ukraine\u2019s role in starting the discredited \u201cRussiagate\u201d investigation. John Solomon\u2019s reporting for The Hill on Ukrainian meddling was removed with editors insisting the material could only be restored if labeled \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and mention of Soros being involved was also labeled a conspiracy theory.\n\nA summary on the Ukraine controversy article now mentions allegations of Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, but claims they are a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d despite reporting by Solomon and Politico on the alleged meddling. According to allegations in those reports, the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign worked with Ukraine\u2019s government to tie Trump and Paul Manafort to Russia, with Ukrainian politician Serhiy Leshchenko helping the investigation and supplying information to Fusion GPS, which was conducting opposition research into Trump on behalf of the Clinton campaign for the same purpose. The same firm commissioned Christopher Steele\u2019s debunked dossier alleging a conspiracy between Trump and Russia. Leshchenko previously admitted to revealing negative information about Manafort to damage Trump\u2019s 2016 election prospects.\n\nCharacterizations of Ukrainian interference allegations as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d have also been added to the article on the impeachment inquiry itself, where it was claimed officials repeatedly told Trump there was no Ukrainian interference. The claim was cited to a New York Times article reporting on comments by former Trump adviser Thomas Bossert to ABC News. Bossert was referring to claims of Ukraine being responsible for alleged hacks into DNC e-mail servers, but his comments were presented out of context as rejecting all allegations of Ukrainian interference.\n\nFurther suggestions of impropriety behind the Russia investigation that Trump is having Attorney General William Bar investigate have also been framed as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d by Wikipedia editors. This includes allegations that Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, who purportedly told low-level Trump adviser George Papadopoulos about Russia having \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton, was a Western intelligence operative entrapping Papadopoulos. Of the sources cited for this label, only one characterizes claims about Mifsud as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d based off a prior report quoting two former CIA officers, one who only rejects Mifsud being a CIA officer and another who states he would not rule out Mifsud being tied to Western intelligence. Entire articles labeling these claims and claims of Ukrainian interference as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d were created by editor Guy Chapman.\n\nOther than labeling these criticisms of the Russia investigation as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d to cast doubt on them, editors also pushed allegations and opinions about Trump and the controversy as fact in violation of the site\u2019s \u201cneutrality\u201d policy. Editor \u201cSPECIFICO\u201d added to the article\u2019s intro the claim that Trump used the withholding of planned military aid to \u201cextort\u201d Ukraine into cooperating with an investigation and \u201ccoerce\u201d the country into providing damaging information about his opponent. None of the cited sources contained these claims.\n\nThese claims were in apparent response to Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s comments during a recent press conference, which media falsely construed as admitting to a \u201cquid-pro-quo\u201d when no such admission was made. Similar biased changes to the intro were made previously. Another editor later undid most changes claiming a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d as fact, though some remained and more were added. Following extensive discussion about the intro, left-wing editors essentially restored the heavily slanted version claiming \u201cquid pro quo\u201d as fact and claimed as fact that it was to gain support for \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d favoring Trump.\n\nIn another case an editor added explicitly that Trump\u2019s actions violated federal campaign finance law. While this material only remained a few hours, it was replaced with material treating the same claims from the Democratic Chair of the Federal Election Commission as factual. The Department of Justice, however, rejected claims Trump\u2019s investigation requests violated the law. Mention of the DOJ ruling has since been added next to this claim after initially being excluded.\n\nPortrayal of some claims wasn\u2019t always consistent across articles. Whereas the Ukraine controversy page claims as fact that Trump solicited foreign interference to serve his personal and political interests, the impeachment inquiry Wikipedia article properly treats these as allegations, which is more consistent with the cited sources. One claim copied to the impeachment inquiry article from the Ukraine controversy page and drastically slanted later, claims as fact in the intro that placement of the Ukraine call transcript on a more classified server was deliberately covering up \u201cpresidential misconduct and politically damaging material\u201d by \u201cintentionally misclassifying\u201d the document. The Ukraine controversy page, however, now rightly treats these claims as allegations.\n\nDespite allegations of inappropriate classification being properly portrayed as allegations on the Ukraine controversy article, editor \u201cBullRangifer\u201d later added that the classification change was \u201cfor political reasons, and not for national security reasons\u201d despite the cited source not supporting the claim. BullRangifer has made numerous edits advancing the anti-Trump narrative on the Ukraine controversy article. He also participated in a smear effort on Wikipedia against China critics the Epoch Times, which followed an NBC News article attacking the outlet\u2019s coverage on the \u201cSpygate\u201d controversy over alleged improper surveillance of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election, branded a conspiracy theory by NBC and Wikipedia.\n\nEditors on Wikipedia, consistent with the site\u2019s rampant left-wing bias, have repeatedly advanced the narrative of President Trump colluding with Russia to the point of trying to misrepresent the outcome of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation debunking the collusion narrative. They have similarly worked to discredit, and sometimes purge, any serious criticism of the integrity of the investigation and legitimacy of the allegations. Even with the DOJ Inspector General\u2019s report regarding FISA surveillance warrants against Trump adviser Carter Page potentially releasing this month, it is unlikely such bias will end.\n\nT. D.
