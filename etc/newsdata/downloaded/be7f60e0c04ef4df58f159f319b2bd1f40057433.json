And as one of the people who helped shape the 1990s consensus \u2014 that the contribution of rising trade to rising inequality was real but modest \u2014 it seems appropriate for me to ask now what we missed. [Emphasis added] \u2026 The pro-globalization consensus of the 1990s, which concluded that trade contributed little to rising inequality, relied on models that asked how the growth of trade had affected the incomes of broad classes of workers, such as those who didn\u2019t go to college. It\u2019s possible, and probably even correct, to think of these models as accurate in the long run. Consensus economists didn\u2019t turn much to analytic methods that focus on workers in particular industries and communities, which would have given a better picture of short-run trends. This was, I now believe, a major mistake \u2014 one in which I shared a hand. [Emphasis added]\n\nKrugman, though, writes that he and his fellow free trade economists \u201chad no way to know\u201d that globalization of the American economy or a surge in trade deficits \u201cwere going to happen,\u201d though the anti-globalization movement had warned for years of the harmful impact free trade would have on U.S. workers \u2014 including Donald Trump.\n\nIn an interview with SiriusXM Patriot\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight, economist Alan Tonelson said that Krugman\u2019s acknowledging that he and the free trade economic consensus has been wrong is \u201cbetter later than never,\u201d but \u201cthe damage has already been done.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been an even more startling, in fact jaw-dropping, development on that front. Paul Krugman, the famous Never Trumper, the famous pro-free trade economist, the Nobel Prize winner just published an article \u2026 saying that for the past 20 years, he and his other globalist, free trade economist friends have been substantially wrong about the effect of globalization, particularly more trade with low income, low wage countries like China,\u201d Tonelson said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been substantially wrong about its effects on the American economy and American workers in particular,\u201d Tonelson said.\n\nMeanwhile, decades of free trade have spurred mass layoffs, unemployment, and offshoring of high-paying American jobs while surging trade deficits. Since China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO), the U.S. trade deficit with China has eliminated at least 3.5 million American jobs from the American economy. Millions of American workers in all 50 states have been displaced from their jobs, which have been lost due to U.S.-China trade relations.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
