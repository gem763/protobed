The young marmot walked into her trap.\n\nThe pictures that followed Bao\u2019s award-winning moment are gruesome, Bao told BBC. He summarized the end result simply.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nature,\u201d he said.\n\nBao was born and raised in the area where he captured the photo, according to the museum. He developed a fascination with local wildlife and now serves as director and chief ecological photographer of the Qilian Mountain Nature Conservation Association of China.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDuring years of photography, I have come to realize that there is a long way to go in terms of environmental conservation,\u201d Bao told London\u2019s Natural History Museum. \u201cAs a photographer, I believe that it is my responsibility to let people know that wild animals are indispensable friends to humans.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSir Michael Dixon, the museum director, said in a news release that the plateau is often referred to as the \u201cThird Pole\u201d because of the \u201cenormous water reserves held by its ice fields.\u201d The area, he said, is under \u201cthreat\u201d because of \u201cdramatic temperature rises\u201d attributed to global climate change.\n\n\u201cAt a time when precious habitats are facing increasing climate pressures, seeing these fleeting yet fascinating moments reminds us of what we need to protect,\u201d Dixon said.\n\nAD\n\nThe grasslands where the foxes live are used by livestock herders, according to the museum, which means the foxes\u2019 habitat and food sources are disturbed by humans. Their usual prey \u2014 the plateau pikas \u2014 \u201care subject to eradication attempts,\u201d according to the museum. If the pikas disappear, so could the foxes.\n\n\u201cImages from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are rare enough, but to have captured such a powerful interaction between a Tibetan fox and a marmot \u2014 two species key to the ecology of this high-grassland region \u2014 is extraordinary,\u201d Cox said.\n\nBao\u2019s photo was selected from 48,000 entries across 100 countries. The museum also awards a Young Photographer of the Year, who this year is Cruz Erdmann for his photo of a glowing big-finned reef squid off the coast of Indonesia.\n\nBoth photos will be displayed at the Natural History Museum in London, with 98 other pictures, from Oct. 18 to May 31.\n\nHere are some of the featured photos:\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Yongqing Bao captured an image just before the two animals clashed, which caught the judges' eyes for everything it conveyed.", "authors": ["Katie Mettler", "Reporter Covering Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VeJrRefRjNp5Vu6DR_rz3R3Oeec=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TG62OHXQIMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
