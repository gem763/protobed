But in between, he made at least his sixth joke about staying in office for a few extra years.\n\nTrump started by saying that he'll \"ultimately leave office in six years,\" which has a good chance of coming true, but added that it could be \"10 or 14.\" Trump did add \"just kidding\" after this obviously unconstitutional idea, but it's far from the first time he's made it.\n\n...years, or maybe 10 or 14 (just kidding), they will quickly go out of business for lack of credibility, or approval, from the public. That\u2019s why they will all be Endorsing me at some point, one way or the other. Could you imagine having Sleepy Joe Biden, or Alfred E. Newman... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 11, 2019\n\nIn March of last year, Trump tossed around the idea of being \"president for life\" after praising China's President Xi Jinping for granting that same term extension to himself. He brought up the subject again this April at a White House event, specifically using the same \"10 or 14 years\" to describe his potential time left in office.\n\nIn May, Trump retweeted Evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr.'s suggestion that he's owed \"2 yrs added to his 1st term\" due to distractions caused by the Mueller investigation. Last month, Trump tweeted again to ask if the \"people would demand I stay longer.\" And a few weeks later, Trump retweeted an absurd meme video showing him running for reelection in the year 90,000, suggesting that both the Constitution and the finite amount of energy contained within the human body do not apply to him.
