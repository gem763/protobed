Trump-friendly commentators have been raising expectations about the IG report, predicting that it will show the FBI purposefully misled the court to surveil Trump\u2019s campaign, and have expressed frustration in recent days over its delayed release.\n\nBut former FBI officials on the receiving end of that probe say the president\u2019s allies are setting themselves up for disappointment.\n\n\u201cIs the IG report going to say we made mistakes? Yes,\u201d said one of the former officials. \u201cBut it won\u2019t say we did so for some nefarious purpose. So the report will be a dry hole for Trump and his supporters. Which is why [Barr and Durham] have now gone to this other theory, positing that the CIA was engaged in some rogue operation to overthrow Trump and therefore feeding the FBI bullshit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s complete nonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d said another former FBI official, sarcastically. \u201cBrennan was a puppet-master and we were just his puppets.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
