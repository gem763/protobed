Even Apple leaked last year's lineup mere hours before their unveiling.\n\nThis time around its some alleged benchmarks, and they sure are interesting.\n\nThe CPU stats of what is believed to be the iPhone 11 has shown up on Geekbench. It's labelled as 'iPhone 12.1' which according to 9to5Mac, is the successor of the iPhone XR.\n\nThe results show that the new 'budget' iPhone will have 4GB RAM, which is a 1GB bump from the 2018 model.\n\nIt also reveals a 5415 score report for single-core and 11294 for multi-core.\n\nIf true, it means the baby iPhone 11 will be 12 per cent faster at single core tasks compared to last year. The multi-core results are much the same, potentially meaning that Apple's A13 chip will have six cores like its predecessor.\n\nOf course, it's worth remembering that different models of the same phone can pull different Gekkbench results. Plus, these could also turn out to be fake.\n\nWe won't know for sure until next week, though it won't be surprising if more leaks spring up between now and then.\n\n[9to5Mac]", "description": "We're a week away from the iPhone 11 launch, which is the perfect time for some last minute leaks.
