If it is serious about addressing the root causes of environmental crises, it must either concede that some (indigenous, poor, black) lives are disposable \u2013 or else adopt an explicitly anti-capitalist stance. Only when it does the latter will the struggle begin in earnest.\n\nIn the meantime, the climate justice movement is being used for greenwashing, and indigenous people are facing serious repercussions.\n\nTake the example of mining company BHP Billiton. This month it announced it had a new purpose: to \u201cbring people and resources together to build a better world.\u201d The brief mentioned BHP\u2019s \u201cstrong record\u201d on responsible business practice, the \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d spent on social investment, its status as the only company in its sector with an \u201cA\u201d rating for climate disclosures. BHP also emphasised \u201crespecting indigenous peoples\u201d as a renewed priority.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAlvaro Ipuana, an indigenous leader from La Guajira, Colombia, tells a different story. Ipuana lives in the shadow of Cerrej\u00f3n, the largest open cast coal mine in Latin America, co-owned by BHP. Its expansion over the last 20 years has forcibly displaced the Afro-descendant Tabaco people. According to campaigners and academics, it has also decimated the capacity for subsistence agriculture for its remaining indigenous Wayuu communities and polluted the rivers that once provided drinking water.\n\nThe region has been drought-stricken for years, and a 2017 Human Rights Watch report described the Wayuu as being in the throes of a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d. The locals lay the blame squarely at the feet of the multinationals.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Their concept of development isn\u2019t functional for indigenous communities.\u201d\n\nThis explanation cuts to the core of an emerging tension in the rejuvenated climate justice movement. While Extinction Rebellion\u2019s focus on net zero carbon emissions is understandable, it ignores extractivism \u2013 the large-scale exploitation of natural resources for export \u2013 which often makes up the core of \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d projects. This has fatal consequences.\n\nCerrej\u00f3n is just one example of BHP\u2019s \u201csocial investment\u201d MO. The company is currently fighting one of the biggest legal claims ever filed in a British court over the worst environmental disaster in Brazil\u2019s history. When a tailings dam burst at Samarco, whole villages were wiped out by the waste sludge from the iron ore plant. Rejecting all charges leveled at the company for accountability, co-owner BHP instead set up a foundation to dispense compensation at its own discretion.\n\nNow BHP wants to wear the clothes of the climate activists. Its chair Ken MacKenzie even claimed at last week\u2019s AGM that \u201cmining is the locomotive of the future on climate change\u201d. Minerals like lithium, cobalt and copper are key for many of the alternatives to fossil fuel-based infrastructure. But large-scale \u201cgreening\u201d projects that rely heavily on unsustainable mining for finite minerals under indigenous land necessarily entail exploitation \u2013 of nature and of people.\n\nAs Extinction Rebellion protests drew headlines, Ipuana joined activists from Chile and Brazil in protest at that AGM in Westminster. The Latin-American representatives accuse the multinational of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d \u2013 plastering over its exploitation of people and resources with buzzwords and empty gestures.\n\nThe briefing released of the meeting shows that companies like BHP recognise the need to placate investor concerns around climate breakdown, and so are trying to rebrand themselves as ethical companies committed to a transition towards green industry. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter that black and brown communities have been fighting this battle for generations with their bodies on the line. The investor is the ultimate customer and, increasingly, today\u2019s investors want to believe their money isn\u2019t funding their grandchildren\u2019s death warrant.\n\nAcross Europe, Extinction Rebellion has succeeded against the odds in making climate breakdown a public priority. Its broad-church approach of remaining avowedly \u201capolitical\u201d (i.e. not anti-capitalist) made sense initially, bringing together a wide coalition from across the political spectrum. As the national conversation begins to move towards specific policy and infrastructure objectives, however, what I see as XR\u2019s reluctance to tackle extractivism threatens to give carte blanche to governments and corporations who are happy to shift the burden of climate destruction onto poor and indigenous communities of colour in the global South.\n\nIn solidarity with those risking violence and incarceration on the front lines, XR needs to ensure that the relentless extractivism that damages lives, livelihoods and ecosystems in parts of the global South is not the basis of its fight for net zero carbon emissions here in the UK.\n\nAnd yet extractivism is a necessary component of an economic model predicated on exponential growth. It is impossible to combat without identifying its roots in colonial capitalism.\n\nThis leaves Extinction Rebellion with a choice to make: either it ignores the ecological devastation wreaked by corporations, or it commits itself to tackling the root cause of that devastation. If it is truly internationalist, it must recognise that climate struggle is class struggle. If it values all bodies equally, it must denounce capitalism itself.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion is facing a crunch point.
