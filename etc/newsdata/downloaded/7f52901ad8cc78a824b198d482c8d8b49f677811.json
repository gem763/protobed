Immediately, the NBA\u2019s Chinese partners suspended all ties with the Houston Rockets, and the NBA released a statement claiming that Mr. Morey had \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China.\u201d\n\nWhat was the terrible thing that Mr. Morey posted? Well, he simply publicly supported the pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong by tweeting the slogan \u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nRight now, Hong Kong citizens are embroiled in the fight of their lives against the growing authoritarianism of the Chinese government. It seems strange, then, that Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta was so quick to tweet that Mr. Morey \u201cdoes NOT speak\u201d for the team. Mr. Morey\u2019s support for basic freedoms, too, was deemed \u201cregrettable\u201d by NBA spokesman Mike Bass.\n\nWhose team are these guys on, anyway?\n\nChina\u2019s, so it seems. And their loyalty is enmeshed with a dependency on China\u2019s money. As one of the most popular NBA teams in China, the Houston Rockets are on track to lose hundreds of millions, if not billions, if the Chinese market continues to punish them for Morey\u2019s \u201cregrettable\u201d proclamation. Of course, that shouldn\u2019t matter to them in the face of the regime\u2019s continual assault on freedom. However, sadly it does.\n\nAmerican businesses have long tailored their products or services to the demands of the Chinese market \u2014 and its censors. As Ryan Khurana of the Institute for Advancing Prosperity has noted, this practice can be seen in everything from Hollywood\u2019s re-editing its films so they don\u2019t violate the Communist Party\u2019s definition of \u201cpublic morality\u201d to Google\u2019s offering to comply with censorship practices that directly oppose its own mission of increasing people\u2019s access to information worldwide.\n\nUntil recently, the American public didn\u2019t really notice. But now, things are different. It\u2019s no longer just a matter of companies changing their product to satisfy the Chinese market. The controversy surrounding the Houston Rockets is evidence that some American businesses are willing to silence their own employees at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nIt\u2019s cowardly, but being brave has become less important to companies as access to China\u2019s enormous market grows into an ever more irresistible prize to firms around the world. China boasts a mushrooming middle class of more than 400 million people and a massive economy that has, in some ways, already surpassed the United States\u2019.\n\nOf course, China is still a ruthless authoritarian state with extreme disregard for human rights. It\u2019s using ever more forceful methods to suppress the Hong Kong protestors and, in Xinjiang, more than one million Muslims are currently imprisoned in so-called \u201cre-education camps.\u201d Any semblance of freedom in their press or speech is seriously absent, too.\n\nAs China Daily, a newspaper owned by the Communist Party, proclaimed, China hopes \u201cthe incident with Morey and the Houston Rockets will teach other companies a lesson: The big Chinese market is open to the world, but those who challenge China\u2019s core interests and hurt Chinese people\u2019s feelings cannot make any profit from it.\u201d In other words, any criticism of China will not bode well for American businesses from now on.\n\nBut U.S. businesses shouldn\u2019t cave to China\u2019s will. In fact, firms that stand for freedom of expression ought not worry about scorn from the Chinese, because Americans shouldn\u2019t be trying to appease an oppressive regime. Rather, companies that act to censor the free expression of their employees should have their feet held to the fire by a concerned American people.\n\nThe U.S. consumer should take a firm stand and potentially boycott those organizations that continue to give in to the draconian whims of the Communist Party. Doing so would create an heavy disincentive to any company thinking of succumbing to the pressures of the Chinese government, and similarly, if the collective pressure of multinational businesses standing up to Chinese censorship builds, the shoe will be on the other foot \u2014 Beijing will be forced to rethink its current practices out of fear of losing the business of many of America\u2019s billion-dollar companies.\n\nLike Mr. Morey, Americans have a duty to stand boldly against authoritarian abuses abroad, even when money is at stake. After all, China isn\u2019t holding all the cards. U.S. consumers have a great deal of power that they can leverage all on their own.\n\n\u2022 Alexander C. R.
