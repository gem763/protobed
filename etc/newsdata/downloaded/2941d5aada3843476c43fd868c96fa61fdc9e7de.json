The Department of Justice must investigate Rudy Giuliani\u2019s potential crimes in trying to get Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election. It also needs to investigate whether White House officials criminally covered up evidence of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nAnd because the whistle-blower complaint alleges that the top law enforcement official in the federal government, Attorney General William Barr, \u201cappears to be involved\u201d in these events, a special counsel must be appointed. Barr obviously must recuse himself: He has a conflict of interest and, more to the point, he is a potential target of the criminal investigation. (A Justice Department spokeswoman has said Barr was unaware of Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy until a whistle-blower\u2019s complaint about it was forwarded to the agency in late August, and that Barr never discussed with Trump investigating former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine.)\n\nTo be clear, Congress should not wait on the results of this special counsel investigation to continue its own inquiries. That\u2019s unnecessary, because Congress is appropriately focused on whether Trump committed high crimes and misdemeanors, not on whether anyone else may have committed a federal crime. It would also obviously be absurd to put a hold on the congressional inquiry to wait for a Department of Justice investigation to conclude.\n\nBut a special investigation is needed because Congress does not have the expertise or the jurisdiction to go after criminal conduct by Giuliani, a private citizen. Nor could it investigate Barr\u2019s conduct in any context other than the separate impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nThese investigations need federal prosecutors and FBI agents. And they need them right now.\n\nBegin with Giuliani. The whistle-blower complaint alleges that in January and February of 2019, Giuliani met with Yuriy Lutsenko, who was then Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general. These meetings preceded Lutsenko\u2019s initiative in March to publish articles in The Hill in which he aired the allegations that Trump eventually asked Zelenskiy to investigate \u2014 allegations about Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as about the supposed origins of the allegation of the Trump campaign\u2019s collusion with Russia in 2016.\n\nA special counsel investigation is needed to determine first whether Giuliani suggested the topic of these articles to Lutsenko, or whether Lutsenko pitched the ideas to Giuliani. Regardless, it seems likely that Giuliani, who was already representing Trump in a personal capacity, was engaged in some form of coordination with Lutsenko. That could easily give rise to a criminal charge of conspiracy to influence the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nSubsequently, Giuliani had many further contacts with Lutsenko and other Ukrainian officials, according to the whistle-blower complaint. All of these need to be investigated, too.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, too, that Lutsenko attacked then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch in his articles for The Hill. She was subsequently recalled by the Trump administration, and in his call to Zelenskiy, Trump said he expected she would \u201cgo through some things.\u201d Depending on what those things were, Yovanovitch, a longtime critic of Lutsenko, may have been the victim of a conspiracy involving Lutsenko and Giuliani.\n\nAs for the cover-up investigation, I explained yesterday that the whistle-blower complaint includes at least three separate acts taken by unnamed White House officials to suppress information about the Trump-Zelenskiy call. Those must be investigated by a special counsel to determine if they constituted criminal obstruction of justice.\n\nBarr cannot be involved in this investigation, nor can any special counsel be answerable to him. The whistle-blower complaint suggests that Barr \u201cappears\u201d to have been involved in the whole affair. On its own, that allegation would be enough to require recusal.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Believe it or not, it\u2019s time for a new special counsel investigation.Not targeting Donald Trump himself: Congress can and will investigate the president in the course of its impeachment inquiry.But as a result of the whistle-blower complaint, a separate investigation does need", "authors": ["Noah Feldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cQ.lVz5m1uF0vQ9ArAoswg--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_opinion_268/15bdbf4e8092d359d8fef73a14ff6eda", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
