REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nAs Rouhani spoke, Iran\u2019s Army Ground Forces began an unannounced military drill in the northwest of the country that borders Turkey, the Iranian Students\u2019 News Agency ISNA reported.\n\nTurkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies will push into Syria \u201cshortly\u201d, a Turkish official said on Wednesday, in an operation world powers fear could open a new chapter in Syria\u2019s ruinous eight-year-old war.\n\nIran, a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has regularly urged Turkey to respect Syria\u2019s territorial integrity and says all foreign military forces \u201cwith an illegal presence\u201d - including the United States - should leave the country.\n\n\u201cWe have openly said that the only solution to ensure safety and security in southern Turkey and northern Syria is the presence of the Syrian army,\u201d state news agency IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on our friendly and brotherly neighbor Turkey to act with more patience and restraint, and to revise its decision and chosen path,\u201d he said.\n\nIran, like Turkey, is home to a large ethnic Kurdish population and Rouhani expressed understanding for Turkish concerns about security on its borders, adding: \u201cWe believe that a correct path should be adopted to remove those concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cKurds in Syria... should support the Syrian army,\u201d he said.\n\nReporting on Iran\u2019s own military drill that started on Wednesday, ISNA said it included rapid reaction units, mobile and offense brigades, and helicopters from the Army Ground Force\u2019s Air Unit.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the military exercise is to evaluate the combat readiness of army units and their mobility and agility in the battlefield,\u201d ISNA said, without referring to the planned Turkish operation in northeast Syria.\n\nAnkara has said it intends to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northeast Syria in order to return millions of refugees there, but the scheme has alarmed some Western allies as much as the risks posed by the military operation itself.\n\nFor Ankara, which views Kurdish YPG fighters in northeast Syria as terrorists because of their ties to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey, an influx of non-Kurdish Syrians would help it secure a buffer against its main security threat.\n\nKurds are spread out in Syria, Iraq, Iran and Turkey.\n\nShi\u2019ite Muslim-dominated Iran has up to 10 million Kurdish citizens, mostly Sunni Muslims. It is facing demands for greater Kurdish autonomy from the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), an armed opposition group.\n\nThere have also been frequent clashes in the area between Iranian security forces and Iranian Kurdish militant groups based in neighboring Iraq, such as the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan (PJAK), accused by Tehran of having links to Kurdish PKK insurgents in Turkey.", "description": "Iran's President Hassan Rouhani called on Turkey on Wednesday to show restraint and avoid military action in northern Syria, as Ankara's forces were poised to advance into an area there being vacated by the U.S. military.", "authors": ["Tuqa Khalid", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438784200&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980NY", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
