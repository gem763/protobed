That is Manchester United\u2019s \u201crightful place\u201d, says a bullish Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r as he prepares for Arsenal\u2019s visit to Old Trafford on Monday.\n\nResults may be flatlining, performances diffident and the team possibly without Paul Pogba, yet Solskj\u00e6r breezily contemplates all this after a few days in which United lost at West Ham and scraped past League One Rochdale via penalties in the Carabao Cup.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t worry what the press write about other teams or me and Man United,\u201d the manager says. \u201cWe are focused on what we have to do: to keep improving. Reading the papers doesn\u2019t change my view. Sometimes my kids are asking: \u2018What\u2019s this [criticism] all about?\u2019\n\nEighth wonder: the pleasure in the pain of being a Manchester United fan these days | Tim de Lisle Read more\n\n\u201cWhen I was a player it was always Man Utd hogging the headlines. We wouldn\u2019t want to scramble through the newspapers to see if things [might] have been written about us. That\u2019s our rightful place [before the glare]. When we lose a game or go through difficult period we must keep our eyes on the prize and keep working in the direction we believe.\u201d\n\nSolskj\u00e6r has walked into his regular Friday media briefing with a smile that remains throughout. The 46-year-old is, indeed, discovering how the United spotlight allows no escape. One bookmaker has him at 6-1 to be sacked next \u2013 \u201cby Tuesday night\u201d (second behind Everton\u2019s Marco Silva) \u2013 and, if some of the punditry and reporting is as feverish, Solskj\u00e6r is calm enough to offer the following assessment.\n\n\u201cI never said it was going be easy this season. There are going to be ups and downs, highs and lows. And when we lose a game we have to trust ourselves and what we\u2019re doing, [keep our] eyes on the prize and keep the principles we believe in.\n\n\u201cAny game in the Premier League is winnable but also losable. It\u2019s margins, fine margins and sometimes you stand there smiling happy to have won a game, sometimes angry because you\u2019ve lost. You\u2019ve got to portray the right image.\u201d\n\nSince the 4-0 win over Chelsea on the opening day United have scored only four league goals in five games and since Solskj\u00e6r was made permanent manager at the end of March they have 17 goals in 18 matches in all competitions.\n\nCombined with some insipid displays \u2013 the one at West Ham was akin to the dullest under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Louis van Gaal \u2013 and a perfect storm for criticism has been created.\n\nYet Solskj\u00e6r says those supporters he meets offer a different take. \u201cThey are very, very positive and [say]: \u2018We can see what you\u2019re doing \u2013 keep going,\u2019\u201d he says, before illustrating an awareness of the vagaries of Twitter and other platforms. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be positive when you meet someone face to face, it\u2019s easy to hide behind social media when negative. I\u2019ve been amazed again by our supporters, to listen to the crowd at Old Trafford \u2013 they\u2019re amazing, keep supporting us. We are going through a leaner patch trophy-wise and the results of the last few games.\u201d\n\nOf the lack of goals Solskj\u00e6r, whose side have conceded seven times in eight matches this season, says: \u201cYou can see how much we\u2019ve improved defensively; that\u2019s where we put the big money in [buying] Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire. We don\u2019t concede many chances [though we] concede too many goals to chances.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cThe other way \u2013 going forward \u2013 is where we\u2019ve struggled with injuries: Paul [Pogba], Anthony [Martial], Marcus [Rashford]. We\u2019ve had some bad luck in that respect. It\u2019s about building relationships, so it doesn\u2019t help when you lose players. These boys need to get the pattern of play and if you\u2019re half a second earlier with your movement it makes all the difference.\n\n\u201cSometimes finishing could be better, can be frustrating, but that\u2019s [also] down to outstanding keepers.\u201d\n\nPogba\u2019s ankle knock has left him in a \u201crace\u201d to face Arsenal and Martial and Rashford are out, along with five other frontline players.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r is not seeking an excuse, though. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the game,\u201d he says, then offers an assessment of where United are. \u201cImproving, evolving, young. The culture is there. We see them every single day in training and there is no issue with work rate, desire. Now can we trust ourselves?\u201d\n\nThe next test comes on Monday, under the lights, before a packed Old Trafford.", "description": "Manchester United are not winning enough games and are not scoring enough goals but their manager is not paying attention to the level of criticism aimed at him and his team", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/061c89a6cdaee96ae547c8f6470aa8923dacc972/0_8_2668_1601/master/2668.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b342a7746286f670061a32923a45e925", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
