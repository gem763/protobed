We have the means and the ability to do so.\"\n\nHe added: \"The risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European Council will grant an extension.\u201c\n\n\"And that is why I will, later today, be chairing a Cabinet committee meeting, extraordinarily on a Sunday, in order to ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations and our preparedness for no-deal is accelerated.\n\n\"It means that we are triggering Operation Yellowhammer.\n\n\"It means that we are preparing to ensure that, if no extension is granted, we have done everything possible in order to prepare to leave without a deal.\"\n\nA Cabinet Office spokesman said: \u201cOperation Yellowhammer is a cross-government programme of work to ensure that Government is ready.\n\n\"It ensures that we are prepared to mitigate impacts of even the potential reasonable worst case scenario if on October 31 the UK leaves the EU without a deal.\n\n\"Preparing for all contingencies, including reasonable worst case scenarios, is what a responsible Government should do, and this is part of that.\u201cWith less than two weeks until October 31, hundreds of civil servants will from today move to work on these operational matters.\u201d", "description": "Government moves towards final stage no-deal Brexit planning as October 31st deadline looms", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa", "Pru Afp Via Getty Images", "Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13202113.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-MAIN-Yellowhammer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
