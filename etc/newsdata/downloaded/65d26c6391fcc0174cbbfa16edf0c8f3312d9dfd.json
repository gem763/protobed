We decided to create the most efficient house in the world,\u201d Max Gerbut, the founder & CEO of haus.me, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM. \u201cNow it\u2019s a product.\u201d\n\nHaus.me currently offers three types of home models: a 400 square feet \u201cstudio\u201d that includes a kitchen and bathroom; a two-bedroom, 800 square foot model; and its newest, largest design at 1,600 square feet. The latter has 3 bedrooms and 2 baths.\n\nHaus.me's 800 square foot, two-bedroom single family home model More\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first ever case when a building can be completely zero carbon emission,\u201d Gerbut explained.\n\nThe design reduces home energy use by more than 20 times when compared to a typical house, according to haus.me. It does so by utilizing a mix of technologies such as solar power, water generation from air condensation, heavy insulation, and autonomous sewage.\n\nGerbut said that achieving such levels of self-sustainability, regardless of location, was not easy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to be on the grid in some place like San Francisco. But in New York, where the temperature may be below [freezing], we need a lot of energy to heat this house,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThe key point is this house can generate enough electricity to heat itself in cold weather\u2026just seven kilowatts per hour is enough to heat this house in any place.\u201d\n\nA rendering of one of haus.me's off-the-grid home models More\n\nFor potential buyers looking at purchasing one of the prefab homes, haus.me follows a method similar to the automakers.\n\n\u201cCustomers visit our website, they can select different options, select different models,\u201d Gerbut stated.\n\n\u201cIt works like a configured page when you\u2019re choosing a new car. Very simple, very easy. And you can choose any color of decor and any home appliances,\u201d he added.\n\nDeign, sustainability, and choice aside \u2014 a critical question remains over whether the homes will become merely a niche product, or see a wider embrace by the housing industry and home buyers. Either way, Gerbut expressed confidence about the outlook.\n\n\u201cThe big goal is to show people and explain to people how self-sustainable life is possible,\u201d he added.\n\nNick Robertson is a senior producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "The first fully self-sustainable, off-the-grid luxury homes will soon be delivered in the U.S. housing market.", "authors": ["Nick Robertson", "Senior Producer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3WXiiWCVVdF4zDdPTjtOeQ--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9NTMyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/015c7120-f1de-11e9-bf3f-5143c04f6895", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
