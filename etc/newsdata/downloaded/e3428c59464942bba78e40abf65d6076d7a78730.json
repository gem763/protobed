Further assessments by the court are expected to follow.\n\nThe initial \u00a350 million damages bill comes in the same week as it was revealed that ex-wife Tatiana and litigation financiers Burford had succeeded in recovering just over one per cent or \u00a35 million of the \u00a3453 million in three years of global litigation.\n\nThe landmark damages assessment is the latest legal confrontation in the long-running battle between Russian billionaire Akhmedov and his ex-wife, which is being fought out in multiple jurisdictions around the world.\n\nThe report submitted by the independent assessor found that Luna's owner lost \u00a350 million in rental income during the period it was under arrest.\n\nThe \u00a3353 million yacht (above) formerly belonged to Roman Abramovich and is now free to sail\n\nIn March 2019, Dubai's court of appeal ruled the city-state's lower courts had been wrong to uphold a UK freezing and overturned the junior court's judgement.\n\nLuna is now free to sail and can do so as soon as essential maintenance work has been completed.\n\nTatiana was awarded a \u00a3453 million divorce settlement \u2013 one of the highest ever - by a UK High Court in 2016 - 15 years after the couple were divorced in Russia.\n\nMr. Akhmedov has consistently disputed the ruling, describing it as an opportunistic attempt to by his ex-wife to benefit financially from the disposal of his company Northgas, which was sold in 2012 shortly before she initiated divorce proceedings in the UK. The couple were divorced in Moscow in the early 2000s after years of estrangement.\n\nThe businessman had previously said he had given his wife millions so she could live in luxry (pictured above their former Surrey home\n\nIn a separate development, it can be revealed today that an American bank account used to pay Luna's running costs contains just \u00a34677.60 ($6,000).\n\nBurford has spent an estimated \u00a3780,000 ($1 million) trying to persuade the US courts to freeze the account in the misguided belief that millions of dollars were on deposit.\n\nBurford, a London AIM-listed company, is believed to have funded Tatiana's battle to secure the settlement in return for up to a third of the total award - or whatever was recovered. So far it has spent almost \u00a320 million legal fees in the Akhmedov case and in supporting Tatiana.\n\nThe company's share price has halved in the last two months.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Akhmedov said: 'Burford's misguided attempt to place Luna under arrest in Dubai has backfired. They have recovered less than one quarter of what they have spent on the case and now faces massive damages claims for their wrongful actions in Dubai against Luna. The \u00a347 million (\u20ac55.5 million) damages report submitted to court shows it could be a very costly mistake.'\n\n\n\n", "description": "Senior judges have now said the English High Court judgement awarding \u00a3453 million to Tatiana Akhmedova (pictured) should not have been enforced.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/19/20193332-0-image-a-2_1572028551132.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
