Aside from telling some sweet anecdotes about her daughter (Stormi's the celeb she wants to collaborate with the most, FYI), Kylie revealed what her biggest fear is. And it's...weird!\n\nPhoto credit: Ellentube More\n\n\"The strangest thing I'm afraid of is, like, dust in a cup,\" Kylie mused. \"I don't know why. It's like one of my pet peeves is when there's a lot of dust in a cup and it's getting in my system.\"\n\nI'm sorry but WHY ARE KYLIE'S CUPS SO DUSTY? Do they not get washed? Does she have so many cups lying around that they just fill up with dust? Someone! Explain!\n\nAnyway, Kylie was also asked what Travis Scott smells like, and her answer was fully iconic. Like not \"dust in a cup\" levels of iconic, but still. \"Travis Scott smells like...he takes a shower in the morning usually so he smells like fresh shower and fresh cologne,\" she said before circling back a few minutes later and adding \"Wait he also smells like weed a lot.\"\n\nWow, Kylie needs to do more of these interviews because I'm learning so much.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Excuse me what?", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2pnVhWzeB1iAXKwmqpAqcw--~B/aD0yODc7dz01NzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/e28434c88ade4d67d2520642127e1aec", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
