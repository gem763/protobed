I used medication to get me out of bed in the morning during an incredibly tough time and to dry up my tears, but I\u2019m not in that place any more.\n\n\u2018I was on them for three years on the advice of my doctor rather than my therapist. But I\u2019m stronger now and the therapy has given me tools to cope with what life throws at me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But I definitely still have days where I struggle to get out of bed.
