The USDA tries to serve that mission by, among other things, keeping U.S. farmers well-informed about potential ecological and macroeconomic threats to their businesses.\n\nAlas, the Trump administration hasn\u2019t looked too kindly on that particular objective, for reasons that aren\u2019t too hard to discern: The biggest long-term ecological threat to U.S. agriculture is the climate crisis that the president refuses to acknowledge, while the biggest near-term economic threat to Big Ag\u2019s well-being has been Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies.\n\nBack in May, Politico reported that Trump\u2019s Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue had \u201cretaliated\u201d against the department\u2019s economists for producing reports that highlighted the sharp decline in farm income during the president\u2019s tenure. Specifically, Perdue brought the USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service (ERS) under the control of its chief economist, who reports directly to him. Then, he moved the ERS from D.C. to Kansas City. Together, these moves triggered a mass exodus of economists from the office, and two-thirds of the ERS\u2019s positions are still unfilled.\n\nPerdue\u2019s department allegedly took a similar approach to ecological research it did not like. As Politico reported in June:\n\nThe Trump administration has refused to publicize dozens of government-funded studies that carry warnings about the effects of climate change, defying a longstanding practice of touting such findings by the Agriculture Department\u2019s acclaimed in-house scientists.\n\nThe studies range from a groundbreaking discovery that rice loses vitamins in a carbon-rich environment \u2014 a potentially serious health concern for the 600 million people world-wide whose diet consists mostly of rice \u2014 to a finding that climate change could exacerbate allergy seasons to a warning to farmers about the reduction in quality of grasses important for raising cattle.\n\n\u2026 [I]n the case of the groundbreaking rice study USDA officials not only withheld their own prepared release, but actively sought to prevent dissemination of the findings by the agency\u2019s research partners.\n\nThis week, the USDA\u2019s inspector general Phyllis Fong announced that her office is launching a formal investigation into the department\u2019s alleged suppression of climate science. In a letter to Democratic lawmakers who had requested such a probe, Fong also acknowledged concerns that USDA\u2019s decision to relocate both the ERS and National Institute of Food and Agriculture to Kansas City might have been intended \u201cas a means to suppress research on controversial topics such as climate change.\u201d\n\nThe federal government\u2019s 2018 National Climate Assessment report found that, on our current warming trajectory, Midwest farmers could see their productivity fall to levels not seen since the droughts of the 1980s. The USDA is currently spending less than one percent of its budget on climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.", "description": "Trump administration appointees allegedly tried to bury research showing climate change\u2019s devastating impacts on U.S. agriculture.
