The brand is on the lookout for additional digital ways to streamline,\u201d the article noted.\n\nThe report said Dunkin\u2019 took first place with the fastest drive-thru, noting that customers spend about 216.75 seconds on average waiting for their orders, whereas Chick-fil-A customers spend about 322.98 seconds waiting for their meals.\n\nHowever, Chick-fil-A has upped their fast-food game by posting team members outside to take orders and payment from customers on their iPads while they wait.\n\n\u201cWe are embracing technology to both provide a better experience for guests and to help take tasks off restaurant team members so they can devote more time to hospitality for our customers,\u201d said Khalilah Cooper, director of service and hospitality for Chick-fil-A.\n\nQSR Magazine did note that the drive-thru\u2019s slow pace may be caused in part by the restaurant\u2019s growing popularity.\n\nOn August 2, Breitbart News reported that Chick-fil-A ranked as America\u2019s favorite fast-food restaurant in a 2019 poll that surveyed more than 7,600 consumers across the nation.\n\n\u201cChick-fil-A received the highest overall score across all categories of restaurants, with a 79 percent \u2018loyalty rating,\u2019 placing it above In-N-Out, which was No. 1 last year,\u201d the report said.\n\nOn September 20, Breitbart News reported that the fast-food chain had doubled its sales in recent years despite protests against the restaurant because of its support for traditional marriage and Christian values.\n\n\u201cNow, Chick-fil-A is the third-largest fast-food chain after only Starbucks and McDonalds. There are only 2,400 Chick-fil-A restaurants compared to more than 14,000 Starbucks locations,\u201d the report concluded.", "description": "Chick-fil-A operates the slowest drive-thru in the fast-food industry, according to a recent study done by QSR Magazine.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-149652891-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
