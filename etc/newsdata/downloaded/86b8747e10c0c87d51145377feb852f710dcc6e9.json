But also, once I arrived in Prague, I went to Theresienstadt, which is a concentration camp just outside of Prague, and I walked around there. I also walked around the old Jewish quarter with a historian, and she kind of filled in a lot of the gaps for me about what it was like to live day-to-day life during that time. I went to different synagogues and to a Jewish cemetery in Prague. I tried to absorb as much as I possibly could. And also, when I met Taika, he immediately told me to watch \u201cMean Girls\u201d and \u201cHeathers\u201d as research to highlight the fact that, of course, Elsa is a victim but she\u2019s also a person with so many layers. Being a victim isn\u2019t what defines her. She\u2019s also strong and courageous and smart, witty, funny, compassionate \u2014 and she\u2019s a girl that\u2019s really scared and confused.", "description": "In writer-director Taika Waititi\u2019s irreverent film, McKenzie takes on the role of Elsa, a Jewish 17-year-old hiding out during World War II", "authors": ["Nneka Mcguire"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gU4F7toCBJrUUATxneBfykyD6Js=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C5A5H6TIABCNTJ4MYSU6SYCG4Q.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
