That followed a Monday move to blacklist 28 Chinese companies alleged to be involved in surveillance and detention of minority groups in China.\n\nBoth announcements came just days ahead of a high-level trade meeting set to take place in Washington on Thursday and Friday.\n\n\"You don't do these things prior to negotiations. It does not set a good tone, that's tactically. Strategically, all these actions \u2014 I think \u2014 are causing the Chinese to wonder: 'What is the US' real motive here?'\" Max Baucus, former U.S. ambassador to China from February 2014 to January 2017, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia.\"\n\nBaucus, also a former Democratic senator from Montana, said the U.S. actions could simply be posturing ahead of the planned trade talks to get a better deal from China. But, \"China will not be bluffed,\" he added.\n\nTaimur Baig, chief economist at DBS Group Research, echoed that sentiment. \"There are ways of putting pressure \u2014 back channel diplomacy, implicit threats and so on, but this is very explicit (and) very noisy,\" he told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia.\"\n\n\"The ... potential loss of face for the Chinese is massive. I can't imagine anybody rationally expecting a constructive outcome out of this,\" he added. Baig also said the timing of the U.S. move \"could not be worse\" and it would \"definitely backfire.\"\n\nBeijing, in response to the U.S. blacklist of Chinese firms, said it urges the U.S. to \"stop interfering\" in its internal affairs and suggested that it would retaliate against the American move.", "description": "The Trump administration blacklisted 28 Chinese companies and restricted visas for officials amid alleged abuses in China's Xinjiang region.", "authors": ["Yen Nee Lee Abigail Ng", "Yen Nee Lee", "Abigail Ng"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106096088-1566778497612gettyimages-1058471374.jpeg?v=1570593392", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
