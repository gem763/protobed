Many prospective homeowners are clearly holding off buying until there is more political and economic certainty,\" FMB chief executive Brian Berry said.\n\nBritain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will do so without a transition deal if necessary, despite a parliamentary vote ordering him to delay Brexit if he cannot reach an agreement.\n\nOther business surveys have also shown a downturn in recent months. September's IHS Markit construction purchasing managers' index (PMI), which focuses on larger construction companies, fell to its second-lowest reading since the financial crisis.\n\nSmall construction companies, which typically build fewer than 10 homes a year, account for about a quarter of house building in Britain, according to the FMB, with most construction dominated by a handful of larger firms.\n\nA shortage of small plots of land with development permission remained the biggest barrier facing firms, followed by financing conditions.\n\nThe proportion of builders reporting constraints due to a lack of skilled workers fell especially sharply, dropping to 26% from 44% - in contrast to widespread reports of skill shortages in the sector - though firms expected worse shortages next year.\n\nThe survey was based on responses from 154 small construction companies, all operating in England.
