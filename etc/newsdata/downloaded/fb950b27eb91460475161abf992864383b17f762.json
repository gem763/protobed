We\u2019ve used TipRanks\u2019 Trending Stocks tool to find three stocks that top analysts are highlighting right now.\n\nFor investors, these stocks offer real advantages: high upside potential and lower cost of entry, based on solid positions in strong niches. These are companies primed to take off as the market continues to gain (the S&P 500 is up 3.6% in the last 30 days). Let\u2019s find out what the analysts have to say about them.\n\nExact Sciences Corporation\n\nIn the world of cancer treatment, early detection and prevention are worth more than the most cutting-edge treatment. Exact Sciences (EXAS \u2013 Get Report), established in 1994, focuses on early detection of colorectal cancer, and its first product, the at-home screening test Cologuard, was approved by the FDA in 2014.\n\nExact Sciences received more good news from the FDA this month, as the agency expanded the age-range for Cologuard users. It had previously been approved for patients over 50; now, it has been approved for at-risk patient over 45. The FDA was not expected to make this move until next year, and the fast-tracked approval is expected to boost Cologuard sales. In a statement after the announcement, CEO Kevin Conroy said, \u201cWe are giving health care providers a sensitive, noninvasive option that has the potential to help combat the rise of colorectal cancer rates among this younger group of people.\u201d\n\nLeerink Partners analyst Puneet Souda noted of the move, \u201cWith an additional 19M patients to their overall population, EXAS is adding a $3B market opportunity, according to previous management commentary, which we believe offers additional upside to their $800M - $810M revenue guide for FY19.\u201d While Souda declined to set a specific price target, he did add, \u201cWe remain Outperform-rated on EXAS given our view that Cologuard remains highly underpenetrated in a 100M+ patient strong market.\u201d\n\n5-star analyst Mark Massaro, from Canaccord Genuity, agrees that the future is bullish for EXAS. He writes, \u201cEXAS this morning announced FDA approval for Cologuard for average- risk individuals ages 45 and older, expanding on its previous indication of age 50 and older. By our estimates, this adds an incremental $3B TAM for EXAS, summing to a Cologuard TAM of $18B and ~106M Americans\u2026 We reiterate EXAS as a top pick and our $135 PT.\u201d Massaro\u2019s $135 price target implies an upside of 38% for the stock.\n\nThe analyst consensus on EXAS is a Strong Buy, based on a unanimous 11 buy ratings. Shares are trading for $98, and the average price target of $132 suggests a 34% upside potential.\n\nTeladoc Health, Inc.\n\nCologuard puts one particular screening test at the patient\u2019s convenience. Teladoc (TDOC \u2013 Get Report) uses digital communications to bring the whole office appointment directly to the patient. The company offers on-demand remote medical care, using videoconferencing to provide non-emergency services for ear-nose-throat issues, prescription refills for non-addictive medications, lab referrals, and basic medical advice and diagnoses. Teladoc describes it as \u201cremote house calls by primary care doctors.\u201d\n\nThe oldest telehealth company, Teladoc started out in 2002 and went public in 2015. The company has expanded its customer base consistently, boasting 8.1 million members in 2014 and 10.6 million in 2015. It has since nearly doubled, and now claims over 20 million members and 95% customer satisfaction.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Mega stocks may suck up all the headlines, but there are deals and opportunities to be found among the smaller companies, as well.
