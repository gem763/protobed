He won a seat in Parliament in last summer\u2019s general election, where the Conservative Party also won the most seats overall in the House of Commons. But the British electorate did not vote for a Conservative government led by Boris Johnson; they voted for one led by Theresa May, who stepped down over the summer after a humiliating series of defeats in Parliament over her Brexit agreement with the European Union. Johnson then won the race to succeed her as Conservative party leader, thus making him the prime minister. What a system.\n\nThe end goal for both men is a wall. In Trump\u2019s case, the wall is a physical barrier stretching from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico. It is unpopular, to say the least. Polls show that a majority of Americans oppose the wall either in full or as a priority. The Democratic-led House largely opposes it; the Republican-led Senate is unenthusiastic about it. But because the president constantly talked about the wall on the campaign trail, his supporters now expect him to bring it to fruition. So do the cable-news talking heads whose shows Trump constantly watches. As a result, he\u2019s more than willing to resort to drastic measures\u2014from shutting down the government to secure funding to urging civil servants to violate the law\u2014to hasten its construction. It\u2019s a matter of pride.\n\nBrexit is also a wall of sorts\u2014albeit a legal and psychic one\u2014designed to separate Britain from the rest of the Europe. The English Channel already provides a physical barrier between the United Kingdom and the continent, but there is one particularly thorny exception: the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Unrestricted movement across the Irish border is a cornerstone of the peace process that ended the Troubles in 1998. Johnson can\u2019t carve out a separate legal status for Northern Ireland without losing the support of a small Unionist party from there, whose handful of votes keep the Conservative government in power. Nor can he agree to the EU\u2019s proposed backstop for the region without losing the support of the hardline Brexiteer faction in his party.\n\nThere are a host of other challenges surrounding Brexit, but none loom larger than this. Should Britain exit the EU without resolving the matter, they would be forced to construct a physical border\u2014which would, in turn, risk reigniting the Troubles. But the EU refuses to renegotiate the agreement it struck with Theresa May, which Parliament rejected multiple times for multiple reasons until her premiership collapsed. And Johnson, who was one of the main Brexit campaigners in 2016, refuses to hold a second referendum that could cut the Gordian knot. Johnson has promised solutions to the Irish question but doesn\u2019t appear to have any at hand. If anything, his hardball tactics to stop Parliament from obstructing Britain\u2019s departure on October 31 suggest he\u2019ll simply force a no-deal Brexit and blame lawmakers for the fallout.\n\nThe absence of a popular mandate might seem restrictive or humbling to normal politicians. But to Trump and Johnson, it\u2019s perversely freeing. Neither of them are really trying to build broad support for their ideas or persuade anyone else to adopt them. Both habitually forsake the hard work that makes democracy possible. Right-wing populists aren\u2019t interested in the marketplace of ideas. They are interested in the raw exercise of power, no matter what norms or unspoken rules of democratic society stand in the way. They make the promises other politicians can\u2019t because they act in ways other politicians won\u2019t.", "description": "Donald Trump and Boris Johnson rely on weaknesses in the system to enact promises which aren't popular.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/24985b6979a0d9b7844ae1ac49fe46ec5e73bd8b.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
