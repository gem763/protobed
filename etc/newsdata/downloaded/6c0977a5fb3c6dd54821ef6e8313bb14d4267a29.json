Moments later, CNN reported that the federal investigation surrounding Giuliani now includes a \u201ccounterintelligence probe.\u201d\n\nAt the center of this legal drama are Giuliani\u2019s tangled links to businessmen from Ukraine, which have been under scrutiny by federal investigators since early 2019, a lawyer who received an early inquiry from the FBI told VICE News on Wednesday.\n\nThe former hard-charging prosecutor now finds himself under investigation by the Southern District (the office he once led), hounded by Congress for documents, mocked for his bouts of unhinged jabbering on cable TV, and facing doubts about his relationship with the one man who could pardon him from criminal consequences for his most controversial acts: President Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s been out there doing things that are dodgy at best, and Giuliani could be a very dangerous witness for Trump.\u201d\n\nEven Trump\u2019s biggest supporters are backing away from the former New York mayor, including GOP House minority leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who suggested Wednesday that Trump\u2019s only misstep in the Ukraine affair might have been hiring Giuliani.\n\n\u201cI think there would be other people I\u2019d have represent myself,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nJohn Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, was so disturbed by Giuliani\u2019s conduct he reportedly called Trump\u2019s personal lawyer \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d\n\nForeign money\n\nOn Wednesday, New York prosecutors announced the arrest of David Correia, 44, who was charged along with two other Giuliani associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, with making illegal GOP campaign donations in an attempt to buy political influence.\n\nA fourth man, aspiring San Francisco cannabis magnate Andrey Kukushkin, was also charged in the case.\n\nGiuliani has insisted he knows nothing about any illegal donations.\n\nBut the move came as prosecutors from the Southern District of New York appear to be widening their investigation into Giuliani\u2019s ties to the men at the center of that alleged criminal scheme.\n\nProsecutors are looking into whether Giuliani violated foreign lobbying laws, according to The New York Times. They\u2019re probing his business dealings in Ukraine, including his finances, meetings, and work for a Ukrainian city mayor, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cI was contacted and asked if I knew whether Giuliani was dealing with Parnas and Fruman.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Pete Sessions, the former Republican Congressman from Texas, confirmed Tuesday he\u2019s cooperating with the SDNY investigation stemming from the indictment of Parnas and Fruman.\n\nSessions \u201cwill be providing documents to their office related to this matter over the next couple of weeks as requested,\u201d spokesman Matt Mackowiak told VICE News. He declined to confirm or deny a WSJ report that Sessions was subpoenaed primarily for documents related to Giuliani.\n\nKenneth McCallion, an attorney based in New York, said the FBI first approached him to ask about Giuliani\u2019s ties to Parnas and Fruman this past spring.\n\n\u201cI was contacted and asked if I knew whether Giuliani was dealing with Parnas and Fruman,\u201d said McCallion, who has represented Ukrainian politician Yulia Tymoshenko.\n\nThe exact nature of the FBI\u2019s interest wasn\u2019t clear, McCallion said, but \u201cit clearly had some national security implications.\u201d\n\nGiuliani\u2019s mysterious relationship with Parnas and Fruman is now a crucial aspect of both Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry and also Giuliani\u2019s own troubles with New York prosecutors.\n\nThe two men helped Giuliani navigate Ukraine at a time when Giuliani was openly pressuring Ukrainian officials to launch an investigation into Trump\u2019s 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden \u2014 an effort at the core of Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nGiuliani has called Parnas and Fruman his \u201cclients,\u201d and told Reuters he was paid $500,000 by Parnas\u2019 company, Fraud Guarantee, which claims to help protect businesses from fraud. Correia, who was arrested at New York\u2019s JFK Airport on Wednesday, is listed as Fraud Guarantee\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer.\n\nBefore their arrest, Parnas and Fruman told Congress they \u201cassisted\u201d Giuliani in his representation of Trump \u2014 even though Trump insisted, \u201cI don\u2019t know those gentlemen.\u201d\n\nEven more troublingly for Giuliani, Trump last week raised doubts about his status as his lawyer, in a sign some observers took to suggest Trump is already distancing himself. Trump remarked Giuliani \u201chas been my attorney,\u201d before clarifying he still works for him.\n\nThat could spell more bad news for Giuliani, who may be counting on Trump to protect him from both Congress and New York prosecutors.\n\n\u201cGiuliani could be a very dangerous witness for Trump.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has sought to defend himself as merely acting at Trump\u2019s behest in a series of public protestations that make it harder for Trump to deny he had any idea what his lawyer was up to.\n\nAnd that could be a problem for Trump, who has shown little hesitation about backing away from other associates facing criminal charges \u2014 including his former lawyer Michael Cohen and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s been out there doing things that are dodgy at best, and Giuliani could be a very dangerous witness for Trump,\u201d said Frank Bowman, author of \u201cHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump.\u201d\n\nJill Wine-Banks, a former member of the Nixon-era Watergate prosecution team, says Trump stands little chance of completely backing away from Giuliani.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just totally unbelievable that Giuliani decided to do all this on his own,\u201d she said. \u201cThat just doesn't make any sense.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former officials have been telling Congress they raised the alarm about Giuliani\u2019s actions in Ukraine, including George Kent, a top State Department official. Kent was instructed by a superior to just \u201clay low,\u201d he told congressional investigators on Tuesday, according to Democratic Rep. George Connolly.\n\nGiuliani has insisted he was acting for Trump and that the State Department knew what he was up to. He\u2019s even brandished text messages from Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, on national TV to prove it.\n\nOn Tuesday, Giuliani refused to comply with a congressional subpoena for documents, in part by arguing that his files are protected by their link to Trump, including through attorney-client privilege and presidential executive privilege, which allows the president to hold some communications secret.\n\nLawyers who spoke to VICE News said those claims probably wouldn\u2019t stand up in court. But they added that a legal fight to resolve the issue could easily outlast Trump\u2019s first term and Democrats\u2019 impeachment push.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s got a legal leg to stand on,\u201d said Bowman, a former prosecutor. \u201cBut he may just be able to run around yelling and obstructing long enough to get past all this.\u201d\n\nCover: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani shakes a hand as he arrives to President Donald Trump's campaign rally, Thursday, Aug. 15, 2019, in Manchester, N.H.
