If there has been a fair amount of Horgan in the main character of hassled, tetchy mother Julia, \u2013 played by Anna Maxwell Martin \u2013 then there also must be, at least from the outside, some of her in the new character Meg.\n\nImpressive and wildly successful, Meg is a woman for whom motherhood and work are tackled with energy and ease. \u201cI just do what I need to do when I need to do it,\u201d she says. Meg is suspiciously close to \u201chaving it all\u201d \u2013 though in Horgan\u2019s world, nobody does. Julia looks at her with envy and awe, which is possibly not a feeling unfamiliar to anyone who has been following Horgan\u2019s career.\n\nHorgan is impressive and wildly successful, and gives a good impression of not being a mess: not only has Motherland been commissioned for a third series, but Horgan has written and directed an episode of Modern Love, a romantic comedy anthology based on the New York Times relationship column (as a mark of Horgan\u2019s pulling power, her episode stars Tina Fey). The comedy for which she is probably best known, Catastrophe, ended earlier this year after four series, while Divorce, a show she created for Sarah Jessica Parker, finished in the summer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anne (Philippa Dunne), Amanda (Lucy Punch) and Julia (Anna Maxwell Martin) in series two of Motherland.

They also co-wrote the 2016 comedy The Circuit, about the horror of middle-class dinner parties.\n\nThe pair met in the early 90s at a youth theatre, then bumped into each other a couple of years later in a pub in north London. He mentioned he had written a play and the next day Horgan phoned him to say they should put it on together. \u201cI honestly think, had I not bumped into her, I wouldn\u2019t have become a writer,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have had the drive. Sharon always had a lot of drive and was quite fearless.\u201d He says Horgan hasn\u2019t changed much since they first met. \u201cShe was funny as fuck. We started working together but it blurred into friendship because she was a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nHorgan was born in Hackney but grew up in Ireland, where her mother is from, on her parents\u2019 turkey farm. After failing to get into drama school, she moved to London, where she did some acting courses and fringe work around other jobs. By the time she met Kelly, she was in her late 20s and wondering if she would have a future in acting. Then they won the BBC\u2019s New Comedy Award, and Horgan has been building a loyal fanbase ever since for her scabrous, unflinching depictions of life and relationships.\n\nThere were other shows, including Dead Boss, a 2012 comedy set in a prison, which she starred in and co-wrote, before the success of Catastrophe, which she created with Rob Delaney \u2013 they starred as a couple thrown together by an early accidental pregnancy, inspired by Horgan\u2019s own marriage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sharon Horgan with Catastrophe co-creator Rob Delaney.

Her writing works, he thinks, because \u201cshe\u2019s in tune with the real world. Often you\u2019ll get something that\u2019s trying to feel dramatic and takes a long time to sell you a character or story, and she can move through plot so quickly while still delivering jokes.\u201d Horgan is at a point in her career \u201cwhere she understands production. She\u2019s more like the US-style \u2018showrunner\u2019, and there are not so many of those around.\u201d\n\nKelly says Horgan is \u201creally truthful\u201d in her work. \u201cThat seems to be really important to her. Making people laugh really matters to her as well.\n\n\u201cWhen we did Pulling we were trying to make sense of what our lives were at that time \u2013 we both did shitty jobs we hated, drank way too much and got into ridiculous situations. I think Catastrophe felt like she was trying to make sense of what it was to be a mother, and the discrepancy between what we think we should be when we\u2019re a parent and what we actually are.\u201d\n\nMotherland scrabbles around in the same shadows, though it seems less about being a struggling mother, and more about what it means to be a grown-up \u2013 and especially a woman \u2013 at that age where life hasn\u2019t lived up to expectations. Helen Linehan, one of Horgan\u2019s co-writers on Motherland, came up with the idea and she and her husband, the writer Graham, took it to Horgan.\n\nThe second series is written by four women. \u201cWe bounced ideas off each other and shared experiences,\u201d says Linehan. \u201cShe\u2019s very generous with her laughter, and making her laugh is like a massive ego boost. She\u2019s good at realistic comedy; it\u2019s not bonkers, it\u2019s usually very relatable.\u201d She has managed to retain that, despite her acclaim and the move into the world of giant US budgets and movie stars. \u201cShe\u2019s very down-to-earth,\u201d says Linehan. \u201cI don\u2019t think that her explosive stardom has made her into any kind of insane diva.\u201d Although, she adds with a laugh, \u201cshe always has a lovely bag.\u201d\n\nHorgan can come across as guarded in interviews, but Kelly says she has never been interested in creating a high profile for herself. \u201cIt never felt like it was about being famous,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we were making Pulling, it was about making it the best it could be, about being honest about it.\u201d", "description": "As Motherland\u2019s second series begins, co-writers tell of the work ethic at heart of writer\u2019s success", "authors": ["Emine Saner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40eb08db65d21e5239098fdc9bc06d37339eeba9/60_1448_6625_3975/master/6625.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b6f19c38e655d646804b04c32e3b7e05", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
