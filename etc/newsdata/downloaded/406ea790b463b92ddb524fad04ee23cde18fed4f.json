The offer was refused\n\nOne rebel, Antoinette Sandbach, offered to back Mr Johnson on both votes but only if she was given a guarantee she would be readmitted and could fight the next election as a Conservative, a source told the Mail.\n\nThis offer was refused.\n\nLast night Miss Sandbach claimed her negotiations were 'primarily' about giving the House of Commons a bigger say on the post-Brexit relationship with the EU, avoiding No Deal at the end of transition and greater Parliamentary scrutiny of prerogative powers.\n\nBut she added: 'Of course I wanted reassurance that longstanding issues in my association would be dealt with having raised these for over 12 months, as if they were not, returning the whip would be a purely symbolic act, I also wanted reassurance that there was still a place in the party for MPs like me on the one nation wing of the party.\n\n'As the policy issues weren't dealt with I and others voted against the programme motion.'\n\nSeveral local associations have already begun the process of selecting new candidates for the seats.\n\nWith an election looming, that process is set to accelerate in the coming weeks, according to a senior Tory source.\n\nMr Hammond defended his vote, arguing it was wrong to push the deal through at 'breakneck speed'.\n\n'I believe in delivering Brexit, but I also believe in Parliamentary scrutiny,' he wrote on Twitter.\n\n'That's why I voted for the Brexit bill to progress to the next stage, but against No10's plan to rush it through at breakneck speed. Now's the time for cool heads, to calmly consider the Bill.'\n\nAt Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Mr Hammond stood alone behind the Speaker's Chair, with Tory MPs appearing to avoid speaking to him during the one-hour session.\n\nj.doyle@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "The rebels include\u00a0Philip Hammond, Ken Clarke, Dominic Grieve QC and Rory Stewart.
