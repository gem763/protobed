The GDP no longer measures our overall economic health. Wealth disparity and income inequality have driven a wedge between the beneficiaries and everyone else: most notably, the recovery of 2008 largely bypassed the young, the non-white, and the mass of Americans earning less $60,000 a year.\n\nThe gap between American workers and CEOs barely scratches the surface. Half of all jobs pay under $19 per hour; one-third under $15. The paltry wage growth for ordinary Americans is swamped by the rising cost of healthcare, housing, education, and household debt. Random misfortune strikes these citizens one by one; the next recession will render them economic flotsam.\n\nAs of now, millions of Americans are standing on a trapdoor.", "description": "", "authors": ["R.N.
