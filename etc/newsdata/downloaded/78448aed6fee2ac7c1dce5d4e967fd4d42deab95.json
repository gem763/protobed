But during the reunion, Potomac Housewives Gizelle Bryant, Robyn Dixon, Karen Huger, Candiace Bassett Dillard and Monique Samuels all brought up additional claims and revealed they had heard Michael had allegedly groped other male staffers over the years.\n\nThe women said the alleged incidents happened back in 2016 during RHOP\u2018s first season, around the same time cameras caught Michael touching the backside of former RHOP member Katie Rost\u2019s then-fianc\u00e9 Andrew Martin on the dance floor.\n\n\u201cProducers have told us you have done that to them,\u201d Bryant told Michael on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI was told the same thing,\u201d said Dixon. \u201cThat the same night that Michael grabbed Andrew\u2019s butt, he also went around and grabbed their butts.\u201d\n\nMichael once again denied any inappropriate touching had taken place, telling Bryant and Robyn, \u201cthat\u2019s not true,\u201d multiple times.\n\nView photos Karen Huger, Micahel Darby, Ashley Darby, and Karen Huger | Charlie Sykes/Bravo More\n\nRELATED: RHOP Cast Discuss More Sexual Misconduct Claims Against Ashley Darby\u2019s Husband Michael\n\nRay Huger, Karen\u2019s husband, then dropped a bombshell of his own \u2014 claiming he had witnessed Michael grab Cohen\u2019s butt after the filming of a previous RHOP reunion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you grab someone\u2019s behind, for myself. I saw you in a different situation,\u201d Ray said. \u201cI saw you grab Andy\u2019s butt at the reunion. \u2026 I saw that. You guys were kidding around. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\n\nThe alleged grab, Ray said, meant that he believed Michael had, in fact, grabbed the cameraman during filming.\n\n\u201cI did believe you did it,\u201d Ray said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a bad thing. I thought you were being playful. \u2026 My situation was, you do that. You told me and you told the world that you do that in Australia all the time.\u201d\n\nMichael maintained his innocence, denying he had ever touched Cohen. \u201cWhat a waste of time. There\u2019s another unfounded accusation from someone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou and I might have had a fun joke about it. I don\u2019t think I grabbed your butt,\u201d he told Cohen, who agreed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d the Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen host said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I was fine with it. The show went well, I love you guys.\u201d\n\nView photos Karen and Ray Huger | Tasos Katopodis/Getty More", "description": "Michael Darby Denies Allegation He Grabbed Andy Cohen's Butt", "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WIEaRdTjVsc5yk_FwIv6qQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/f1e37c73c5e45b757a3627e52d81c4a9"}
