Performing songs from that year's Epic, she huddled around a single acoustic guitar with backup singer Cat Martino to perform a set of tender and evocative folk-pop songs.\n\nCut to nearly a decade later. One of only a handful of artists to get a repeat headlining engagement at the Tiny Desk, Van Etten has spent the last few years purging her bucket list: She's become an actress (appearing as a guest star on The OA), released a string of increasingly aggressive albums (the latest of which is this year's synth-driven Remind Me Tomorrow), toured the world, performed on Twin Peaks, written music for films, become a mom, gone back to school and popped up in collaborations with everyone from Land of Talk to Jeff Goldblum.\n\nSo it's only natural that this Tiny Desk concert feels different; you can hear it before Van Etten and her band even show up onscreen. Its pace set by the ticking beat of a drum machine, \"Comeback Kid\" is in full bloom here, with a swaying arrangement that fills the room before Van Etten opens her mouth. Backed by a full band \u2014 including frequent Van Etten collaborator Heather Woods Broderick, who played the Tiny Desk as a member of Horse Feathers way back in 2009 \u2014 the singer performs with considerable intensity here, seething through \"You Shadow\" before punctuating the set-closing \"Seventeen\" with a scream that slashes through the office air.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Comeback Kid\"\n\n\"You Shadow\"\n\n\"Seventeen\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nSharon Van Etten: vocals, guitar; Heather Woods Broderick: keys, vocals; Jorge Balbi: drum machine; Devin Hoff: bass; Charley Damski: keys, vocals\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, CJ Riculan, Niki Walker; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Mhari Shaw/NPR", "description": "Nearly a decade after her first appearance at the Tiny Desk, Sharon Van Etten returns with a full band and a bigger, bolder sound.", "authors": ["Stephen Thompson"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/04/sharonvanetten-mshaw_wide-60c5d639670e1dcedfbeb98c16c5d930a2c9b5fd.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
