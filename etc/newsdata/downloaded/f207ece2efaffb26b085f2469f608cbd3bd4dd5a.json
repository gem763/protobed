Only five months have passed since the last election, which had a turnout of more than 75% \u2013 the highest in 15 years. In an increasingly conservative Europe, it was a rare election result that lifted progressive spirits: Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s victorious Socialist Workers\u2019 party looked as if it would almost certainly have to form a coalition government with Unidas Podemos, the newer, more leftwing party led by Pablo Iglesias. But since the election in April, the two have failed to reach an agreement. In the end, S\u00e1nchez preferred to risk another election rather than rely on a party that would put pressure on him from the left.\n\nSpain likely to return to the polls in November after party talks fail Read more\n\nThe negotiations have been a sad spectacle, not least because the voters\u2019 message in April had seemed so clear. On the night of the socialists\u2019 victory, hundreds of ecstatic supporters outside the party\u2019s headquarters chanted anti-fascist slogans and urged party leaders not to side with Ciudadanos, a rightwing technocratic party. They wanted a leftwing coalition, and it looked like a done deal: throughout the electoral campaign, S\u00e1nchez had claimed he would have no problem governing in coalition with Unidas Podemos.\n\nBut just a few days after the socialists\u2019 triumph, they announced that they would attempt to govern alone, presumably with outside support from Unidas Podemos and the nationalist parties of the Basque country and Catalonia. As negotiations dragged on, however, S\u00e1nchez increasingly reached out to his party\u2019s traditional sparring partners in the conservative People\u2019s party, as well as Ciudadanos. But with both parties competing to lead the opposition against S\u00e1nchez, efforts to govern with their support were always doomed.\n\nMeanwhile, Unidas Podemos made it clear that the only role it was willing to accept was in a coalition government, with a number of ministries handed to its politicians. Over the summer, the negotiations between the two parties broke down. More than anything else, the talks collapsed due to strategic considerations. As Pablo Sim\u00f3n, a political scientist at Carlos III University in Madrid, recently put it, neither party was sufficiently scared of another election.\n\nThree recent polls showed gains for the socialists and for the People\u2019s party, modest losses for Unidas Podemos and declining support for both Ciudadanos and the far right. For S\u00e1nchez, that suggests a scenario in which he could further weaken Unidas Podemos and pass budgets and legislation without having to rely on support from Catalonia\u2019s pro-independence Republican Left party.\n\nYet there\u2019s something else going on: huge discontent among voters. In one poll, carried out for El Pa\u00eds, 90% of respondents reported feeling disappointed, angry or worried about the inability to form a government. Though far from impossible, a repeat of April\u2019s high turnout seems unlikely. And what neither the socialists nor Unidas Podemos seemed to take seriously in their negotiations is that these feelings were stronger among leftwing voters than those on the right. This could be a big problem for the socialists, as they were especially effective at mobilising voters who had abstained in previous elections, by adopting more leftwing rhetoric and emphasising the threat of a resurgent far right.\n\nTo understand Spain\u2019s increasingly fragmentary politics, you have to go back to the indignados movement that erupted in May 2011. At a time of austerity, massive unemployment, widespread evictions and high-profile corruption scandals, hundreds of thousands occupied public squares throughout the country. Chanting \u201cNo nos representan\u201d (\u201cThey don\u2019t represent us\u201d) and demanding \u201creal democracy now\u201d, they often criticised the system that emerged from La Transici\u00f3n \u2013 the country\u2019s transition from dictatorship to democracy in the late 1970s \u2013 as an inauthentic partitocracia (\u201cpartocracy\u201d) designed to protect the two mainstream parties and accommodate members of the old regime.\n\nAs the establishment parties routinely ignored the indignados\u2019 demands for more direct participation, social rights and economic democracy \u2013 many of which were supported by an overwhelming majority of citizens \u2013 new parties emerged at the local, regional and state levels to capitalise on the movement\u2019s discourse.\n\nThe process continues. This weekend, it was announced that M\u00e1s Madrid, the new party led by \u00cd\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, a founding member of Podemos, will run in the election. By emphasising feminism, ecosocialism and political participation, the party hopes to mobilise those disenchanted by the sad spectacle of the last few months. Yet many fear this will just divide the left further, even paving the way for a rightwing government.\n\nUnlike the politicians who represent them, Spanish voters welcome a pluralistic form of politics. According to the El Pa\u00eds poll, just 16% of Spaniards are in favour of a return to the de facto two-party system that emerged from La Transici\u00f3n. By contrast, 84% believe the parties must deal with the new multiparty system and grow accustomed to reaching agreements.\n\nIndeed, over the last two decades, the country has become much more diverse, both in terms of its political views and its demographic composition. At the same time, a broad consensus has emerged in favour of more direct and binding political participation \u2013 through participatory budgets, citizen-initiated legislation and referenda \u2013 as well as affordable housing, universal health care, and greater transparency and accountability. But as the parliament has become somewhat more \u201crepresentative\u201d of the population\u2019s demands, party politics has become more susceptible to blockage. The November election is only the latest evidence of the existing political institutions\u2019 failure to deal with an electorate that is outgrowing them.\n\nThe indignados pointed this problem out eight years ago: their radical critique of representative democracy is just as relevant today. It is time for the demand at the heart of their movement, the demand for more direct participation that can bypass the impasses of party politics, to finally be taken seriously.\n\n\u2022 Carlos Delcl\u00f3s is a sociologist and associate researcher at the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs (CIDOB).
