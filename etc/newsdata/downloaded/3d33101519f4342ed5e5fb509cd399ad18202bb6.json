Jadon is a great player, no discussions, but he still has a lot to learn.'\n\nSancho was largely ineffective as England were beaten by the Czech Republic 2-1 for their first qualifying defeat in ten years.\n\nThe winger is starting to become a key attacking figure for England under Gareth Southgate\n\nHe then came on for the Three Lions in their 6-0 demolition of Bulgaria. He scored twice in last month's 5-3 success against Kosovo as he has come into the thoughts of manager Gareth Southgate.\n\nRecently Sancho has been linked with moves to the Premier League after a stellar season in Germany last year. He scored 12 goals and provided 14 assists as Dortmund finished as runners-up to Bayern Munich and reached the Champions League knockout stages.", "description": "His manager Lucien Favre has decided to discipline his star man for the Bundesliga clash despite Sancho chipping in with three goals and five assists in six appearances this season.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/11/19919184-0-image-a-14_1571482426623.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
