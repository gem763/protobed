Rather than devote space to yet another analysis of the sonata form, Gioia\u2019s focus is primarily sociocultural: He wants to explain the dynamics of music history, to track how styles and forms evolve, run their course and are eventually replaced or re-energized. Naturally, he has a thesis. Just as societies need carnivalesque holidays such as Mardi Gras to remain healthy, so too does music require regular infusions of Dionysian eroticism and violence. Conservative practices and arthritic genres must be periodically disrupted and undermined.\n\nIn particular, Gioia argues that \u201cmusical innovation happens from the bottom up and the outside in.\u201d After all, fresh ideas are seldom found in the conservatory, cathedral or concert hall. One needs instead to search out \u201cthe neglected spheres of music that survive outside the realms of power brokers, religious institutions and social elites.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor Gioia the music that truly matters is the kind that upsets Mom and Dad \u2014 and it almost always emerges from the dispossessed. Slaves, outlaws, criminals, poor country folk, foreign emigrants and inner-city kids aren\u2019t hampered by genteel aesthetic strictures. Besides, while heard melodies are sweet, those never heard before can be even sweeter, albeit sometimes a bit loud or strangely syncopated. Ultimately, Gioia points out, most of the important developments in American music spring from African American roots. Spirituals, gospel choruses, ragtime, the blues, jazz, rock, hip-hop \u2014 these define our nation\u2019s ever-changing soundscape.\n\n\u201cMusic: A Subversive History\u201d covers the entire 4,000 years that humankind has been making rhythmic and harmonious noise. Did you know that there are more than 1,000 references to music in the Bible? Or that the United States \u201csupports 130 military bands, spending three times as much on military music as on the National Endowment for the Arts\u201d? Or that the oldest songwriter known by name is Enheduanna, a high priestess of Ur in Sumeria? From the beginning, music has always been linked with magic, medicine and mysticism.\n\nFor Gioia, the pre-Socratic philosopher Pythagoras may be the most important and dire figure in his entire book. This is because Pythagoras conceptualized music as \u201ca rational science of sounds that could be described in mathematical terms.\u201d As a result, \u201cthe ratios and proportions that initially helped us to grasp songs turned into the rules and constraints that defined them.\u201d Before Pythagoras, women played a central role in music-making; for a long time afterward, not so much. The ecstasy, communal rites and personal sexual anguish we associate with Sappho were displaced by Plato\u2019s warnings about music\u2019s emotionalism, then overshadowed by imperial Rome\u2019s martial airs and marching anthems.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd so it goes throughout history: \u201cOn the one hand we encounter the music of order and discipline, aspiring to the perfection of mathematics and aligned with institutional prerogatives. On the other, we find music of intense feelings, frequently associated with magic or trance states, and resistant to control from above.\u201d And yet the former cannot exist without the latter. \u201cThe intense songs of outsiders and various marginalized groups possess power, and that power can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d So the rebel sounds are eventually absorbed, the rebels themselves co-opted into becoming the new establishment. What initially shocks in the South Bronx ends up being performed at Carnegie Hall.\n\nAlthough Goia doesn\u2019t say so, this pattern governs nearly all art forms. The best emerging writers metaphorically reject their domineering parents and gravitate to their raffish uncles and outcast aunts. Over the past half century, for example, mainstream realistic novels have lost their once privileged centrality to crossbred works that draw inspiration from fantasy and science fiction, crime novels, pornography and the western. The next generation of writers will again look to the margins \u2014 perhaps to Twitter or computer games \u2014 to shake up the \u201cdominant paradigm\u201d and \u201cmake it new.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t speak highly enough about \u201cMusic: A Subversive History.\u201d Though Gioia can be subtly boastful at times, it\u2019s never egregious, and he is always fun to read. Women, he notes, were traditionally associated chiefly with \u201cthe three L\u2019s: the lament, the lullaby, and the love song\u201d\u2014 and these are, he ruefully adds, \u201cthe three genres that rarely got preserved for posterity.\u201d Nearly 300 pages later we learn that the modern music industry, for which Gioia\u2019s disdain goes undisguised, can also be described with three L\u2019s: \u201clitigation, legislation, and lobbying.\u201d Throughout, the book gravitates to music\u2019s bad boys: the celebrated madrigalist Gesualdo got away with murdering his wife and her lover; Bach, the father of 20 known children, liked his beer as much as any Supreme Court justice; and the Sex Pistols\u2019 Sid Vicious embraced self-destruction with a lover\u2019s ecstatic ardor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI suspect that academic scholars will pooh-pooh aspects of \u201cMusic: A Subversive History.\u201d That\u2019s as it should be. Despite his awards, Ted Gioia remains something of an outsider critic, convinced that the passion for destruction can be a creative passion. As he writes, in his book\u2019s final chapter \u2014 a list of 40 aphoristic takeaways \u2014 \u201cInstitutions and businesses do not create musical innovations; they just recognize them after the fact.\u201d\n\nMichael Dirda reviews books each Thursday in Style.\n\nMUSIC: A SUBVERSIVE HISTORY\n\nBy Ted Gioia\n\nBasic Books. 514 pp. $35\n\nAD", "description": "Ted Gioia\u2019s sweeping history is as subversive \u2014 and immersive \u2014 as his title suggests.", "authors": ["Michael Dirda"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/v4oBiZHrgYudrXayKwL_S99Nid8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RS4YCQHPOII6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
