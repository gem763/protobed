He has continued to fabricate information and clearly Sen. [Ron] Johnson is running scared of Donald Trump, as are the other Republican senators,\" he said on the NBC News show. \"Because, if they say anything against him, he comes after him with vengeance. So, he is the typical bully, and so now I'm... being pilloried as an example of the deep state.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly has slammed Brennan over the years. \"Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director? He will go down as easily the WORST in history & since getting out, he has become nothing less than a loudmouth, partisan, political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!\" he tweeted last year.\n\nTodd defended Brennan and said his character had been \"assassinated,\" before adding that there was an active campaign in America to bring down the country's intelligence community. Brennan said he didn't want to hurt the intel community with his public appearances but felt compelled to take on the president and urged Republicans senators to do the same.\n\nSEN.

I\u2019ve had many issues with the Democrats over the years, but I have never seen anything like the Republicans right now as far as just misrepresentations of the truth, because of what Donald Trump has done.\"\n\nTodd then asked Brennan to rate the present American government the way the CIA did with foreign countries; Brennan said he would declare America a \"corrupt,\" crumbling democracy under Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We would look at it as a very corrupt government that is under the sway, right now, of this powerful individual who has been able to just corrupt the institutions and the laws of that country,\" Brennan said.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s no longer a democracy if an autocrat has it in his hands and people like [Ron] Johnson and others are putty in his hands -- which means that the democratic principles upon which this country are founded are eroding right now.\"", "description": "Republican senators are fearful of backlash from the White House and President Trump\u00a0and have allowed those fears to quash any meaningful action on impeachment, said former CIA director John Brennan on Sunday.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
