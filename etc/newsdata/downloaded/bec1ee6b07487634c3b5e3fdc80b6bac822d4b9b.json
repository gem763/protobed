I\u2019m a little bit nervous about that coming out but I feel like you should be. That\u2019s a good feeling to have.\n\n\u2018I feel like I\u2019ve said something that I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be brave enough to say.\u2019\n\nKrept & Konan\u2019s album Revenge Is Sweet is set for release on Friday (1 November).\n\nGot a showbiz story?
