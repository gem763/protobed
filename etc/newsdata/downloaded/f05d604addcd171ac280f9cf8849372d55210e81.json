Belichick coached the Cleveland Browns for five years before joining the Patriots in 2000. He began his NFL coaching career as a special assistant for the Baltimore Colts in 1975.\n\nBelichick previously said he didn\u2019t plan to coach into his 70s, but said he thinks differently now.\n\n\u201cWhen I said it, maybe I didn\u2019t know what 70 felt like,\u201d Belichick said Monday on WEEI. \u201cSo I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s an accurate statement today or not. At the time, I didn\u2019t feel that way. Now that I\u2019m closer to that age, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBelichick was asked if he could coach until he\u2019s a \u201cyoung 80\u201d during the weekly interview.\n\n\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cBe a young anything.\u201d\n\nThe Patriots coach said in his documentary A Football Life: Bill Belichick that he didn\u2019t want to be like former coach Marv Levy and coaching into his 70s. Levy, 94, began his NFL coaching career in 1969 and coached the Buffalo Bills in his final season in 1997. He was 72 when he retired.\n\nBelichick won his 300th game Sunday against the Cleveland Browns. The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach ranks third in wins, trailing only Don Shula (347) and George Halas (324) on the all-time list. The Patriots (8-0) averaged 12.5 wins per season in the nine seasons entering their 2019 campaign. Belichick turns 68 on April 16.\n\nThe Patriots face the Baltimore Ravens at 8:20 p.m. EDT Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.", "description": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick teased the idea of possibly coaching until the age of 80.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Perry-Knotts-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
