It\u2019s also significantly less than the $25.3 million that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raised during the last three months \u2014 and even fell short of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s (D) impressive $19.1 million haul during the same period.\n\n\u201cWe haven't raised what a lot of people have \u2014 we got started way later than everybody else \u2014 but we\u2019ve raised, this last quarter, $15 million, in the middle of summer,\u201d Biden said at a Thursday evening fundraiser in California, according to a pool report.\n\nREAD: Inside Bernie's fight to stay close in Iowa\n\nThe mediocre haul is the latest sign that Biden is struggling with generating base excitement about his race, as he\u2019s seen Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) catch up to him in national polling, with her and Sanders running even with Biden in some key early-state polls. Warren has yet to release her third-quarter fundraising number.\n\nDuring the same period, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) brought in $11.6 million, businessman Andrew Yang raised $10 million and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) raised $6 million.\n\nBiden\u2019s team framed it as plenty of money to execute their game plan \u2014 the most important factor in fundraising.\n\n\u201cThe question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond. Our campaign unequivocally does and builds on our strength each week,\u201d Biden Campaign Manager Greg Schultz insisted in a statement.\n\nREAD: Congress got nothing done during Clinton's impeachment. Trump's will be worse.\n\nSummer is indeed a tough time for candidates to raise money, especially ones like Biden who are more dependent on large-dollar donors. The Trump impeachment scandal also overshadowed the final week of the fundraising quarter, though since he was going after Biden during that time there were opportunities for the vice president to cash in on his attacks.\n\nThe numbers are unlikely to instill confidence in establishment Democrats who were hoping that Biden would use his deep ties in the party and strong name I.D. to outpace his rivals heading into a crucial stretch of the 2020 Democratic primaries.\n\nCover: Former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden speaks during a gun safety forum Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019, in Las Vegas.
