(File photo: Keith Gardner/ICE)\n\nMore than 650 people have signed a petition condemning the Harvard Crimson\u2019s coverage of an on-campus protest demanding the abolition of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThe Crimson reached out to ICE for a comment on a September 13 story about the protest which was led by student-run immigration advocacy group, \u201cAct on a Dream\u201d in cooperation with sympathetic campus groups.\n\nA month after the article was published, Act on a Dream started a petition, cosigned by ten other campus organizations, objecting to the Crimson\u2019s decision to reach out to ICE for comment on the grounds that doing so might endanger the students who were quoted criticizing the agency.\n\n\u201cIn this political climate, a request for comment is virtually the same as tipping [ICE] off, regardless of how they are contacted,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cThe Crimson, as a student-run publication, has a responsibility to prioritize the safety of the student body they are reporting on \u2014 they must reexamine and interrogate policies that place students under threat.\u201d\n\nCrimson President Kristine E. Guillaume stated that the paper did not provide names, immigration statuses, or extended quotes of those involved, and defended the decision to ask ICE for comment as part of \u201cfundamental journalistic values.\u201d The Crimson has also been defended by several journalism organizations which argued the reporters were following standard practices.\n\nAct on a Dream tweeted Saturday calling for individuals and organizations to decline interview requests from the Crimson until the publication changes its policies regarding requests for comment. The Harvard College Democrats tweeted a similar statement.\n\nWe're not talking to @thecrimson until they stop calling ICE on students, and we urge our members to sign Act on a Dream's petition here -> https://t.co/QpHhS9eAbt Read our full statement below\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/5E24tT6hmM \u2014 Harvard College Democrats (@HarvardDems) October 17, 2019\n\nMarion Davis, director of communications for the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, wrote that while she understands the paper\u2019s desire to be objective, \u201cgetting both sides isn\u2019t always what is fair, especially when one side has already made its views well known through the megaphones of government.\u201d", "description": "More than 650 people have signed a petition condemning the Harvard Crimson's coverage of an on-campus protest demanding the abolition of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
