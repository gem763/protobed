They're silencing me because I showed up with an affidavit yesterday -- an accuser who's willing to stand up and point the finger at Joe Biden and say 'you're a crook'.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign wrote to NBC News, CBS News, Fox News, and CNN to voice \"grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump,\" according to The Daily Beast, which first reported the existence of the letter.\n\nGIULIANI WASN'T WORKING ALONE IN BIDEN UKRAINE PROBE\n\nThe memo, drafted by Biden aides Kate Bedingfield and Anita Dunn, continued: \"While you often fact check his statements in real-time during your discussions, that is no longer enough. By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\"\n\nShould a network choose to book Giuliani, the Biden campaign called for \"an equivalent amount of time\" to be provided \"to a surrogate for the Biden campaign.\" The letter noted Giuliani was not a public official, but Trump's lawyer and personal advisor.\n\nSpeaking separately to Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Giuliani brought up the affidavits and called the situation Clintonesque.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cThe pattern is a pattern of pay for play. It includes something very similar to what happened to the Clinton Foundation,\" Giuliani said, \"which goes to the very core of, what did Obama know and when did he know it?\"\n\nGiuliani referred to a December 2015 New York Times article about Hunter Biden, Burisma and a Ukrainian oligarch, and how the younger Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian company could undermine then-Vice President Biden's anti-corruption message.\n\n\"The question is,\" Giuliani asked, \"when Biden and Obama saw that article, about how the son was pulling down money from the most crooked oligarch in Russia, did Obama call Biden in and say 'Joe, how could you be doing this?'\"\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report", "description": "Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani blasted the Biden camp for what he characterized as trying to \"silence\" him by encouraging media outlets not to book him on-air.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Guiliani-Hannity.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
