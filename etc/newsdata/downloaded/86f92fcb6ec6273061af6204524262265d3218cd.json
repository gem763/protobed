The votes will be sent in sealed envelopes back to the country ahead of election day on 17 September.\n\nIsraelis are voting in a second poll that no one wanted \u2013 not the government, not the opposition, not the public and certainly not the treasury, which says the election will cost more than \u00a3100m.\n\nThe prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appeared to win an April ballot when he and rightwing parliamentary allies came out ahead. However, his attempts to form a coalition government stalled over disagreements between Jewish ultra-Orthodox parties and secular politicians.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman, a former defence minister and leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu party, had sought guarantees that ultra-Orthodox religion students, who are largely exempt from conscription, would be forced to serve in the army.\n\nNetanyahu ultimately failed to quell the infighting. Rather than give the opposition a chance to forge a government, he instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, triggering repeat elections and giving him another chance.\n\nLieberman, a Netanyahu ally-turned-rival, appears to be the biggest beneficiary of the second election. His public dispute with religious leaders has seen his party jump in popularity, possibly with secular Israelis, and it seems he could gather enough seats to become a kingmaker for the next government.\n\n\u201cBefore the election [Lieberman] was seen as part of the centre-right or the right-religious coalition. Now he is a player in the middle of the map, a pivot player,\u201d said Gideon Rahat, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute.\n\nThere have been few other major changes this election compared with the last, and the campaign only started to gather speed this month. Netanyahu still faces three major corruption scandals \u2013 charges he denies \u2013 with pre-trial hearings to begin next month. As in previous election run-ups, he has been accused of appealing to hardliners and exploiting domestic divisions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Former Israeli defence minister and leader of the Yisrael Beiteino party Avigdor Lieberman in Tel Aviv.

The 69-year-old leader has promised to annex Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories, a decision that would kill off already dying hopes of an end to the occupation.\n\nHe also made a lightning visit to London and met Boris Johnson, a trip interpreted domestically as bolstering the image he likes to cultivate as Israel\u2019s ultimate representative.\n\nAt home, he has sought to pass legislation that would place cameras in polling stations. His party was criticised in April for sending monitors with body-cameras to Arab constituencies \u2013 a move condemned as voter intimidation. Netanyahu argues cameras would lessen voter fraud.\n\nMeanwhile, an old foe, former prime minister Ehud Barak, has returned to politics to unseat Netanyahu. In July, Barak made a pact with leftwing politicians to end what he said was Netanyahu\u2019s \u201crule with the radicals, racists and the corrupt\u201d, but the alliance does not look likely to gain many seats.\n\nArab parties, too, have formed an alliance in an attempt to regroup after the April poll. Then, disunity cost them seats, with voter turnout from Palestinian citizens of Israel \u2013 nearly a fifth of the population \u2013 low.\n\nThe two major parties \u2013 Likud and Blue and White \u2013 are close again and could draw. In many ways the true battle for power in Israel will begin the day after the election, when the negotiating begins to form a coalition government.\n\nTo crack the stalemate, Benny Gantz, the leader of the Blue and White party, seems to be betting on a unity government with Likud, but one that does not include its leader, \u201cKing Bibi\u201d. That would be a huge and taboo move for Likud, as Netanyahu has won his party more than a straight decade in power and become the country\u2019s longest-serving prime minister.\n\nProfessor Rahat says there are no guarantees any government will be formed. Polls show the election result might make it even harder to achieve than it was in April, possibly giving no party leader a clear route to power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like Brexit; people know what they don\u2019t like, but there is no majority for anything positive.\u201d\n\nBut there will be huge pressure to do it right this time. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you can wrap the nation into a third election.\u201d", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu will again try to form a coalition to bring current deadlock to an end", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c555b981ede8671a7007adc393d26272c0884cb7/0_32_1141_685/master/1141.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e3d701622bb8543a9d52fa8e21857173", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
