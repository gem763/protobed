As long as i\u2019m in music video\u2026\u201d Kylie responded in an Instagram story. Honestly, asking to be in the video is fair enough considering her mum, Kris Jenner made the cut for Thank U, Next.\n\nAriana is pretty well known for sampling other artists on her tracks, from NSYNC\u2019s It Makes Me Ill to Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s My Favourite Thing, so it\u2019s not exactly out of character for her to want to cash in on the latest viral internet sensation.\n\nThe now-viral video is a part of the Kylie Cosmetics Office Tour video uploaded to YouTube last week. Kylie\u2019s office tour gave us all a glimpse into what life would be like if we were billionaires who own huge cosmetics companies. We saw her M&Ms with her face on them and her Moet & Chandon vending machine, the place makes any other office look like a slum. But somehow, out of everything in the wild office tour, the internet decided to freak out over her singing.\n\nSo who knows, we might get an extended version of \u201cRise and Shine\u201d by Ariana Grande in the not-too-distant future. Fingers crossed we get a Kylie feature in the song as well as the video. The ultimate collaboration.", "description": "Kylie Jenner broke the internet recently with her singing video to daughter, Stormi.
