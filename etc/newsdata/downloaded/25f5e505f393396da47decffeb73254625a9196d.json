The[y\u2019re] wasting taxpayer dollars to declare 5M law-abiding Americans domestic terrorists, and it\u2019s shameful.\u201d\n\nSeriously, what is in the minds of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to call out a legal, lawful, proper and useful organization like the NRA a \u201cdomestic terrorist\u201d group?\n\n\u201cAll countries have violent and hateful people, but only in America do we give them ready access to assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, thanks, in large part, to the National Rifle Association\u2019s influence,\u201d the resolution states.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the bigger deal: The resolution calls for the local government to reconsider its dealings with any companies, any contractors, any entities who support and conduct business with the NRA.\n\nThat\u2019s the real domestic terrorism \u2014 a government body that believes it can strip citizens of God-given rights to self-defend with bullying and intimidation tactics.\n\nCome on, America, Wake up and smell the tyranny. The NRA is not a domestic terrorist group. Labeling so is just stupid beyond belief.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
