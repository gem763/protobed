Push to breakup Big Tech divides conservatives", "language": "en", "text": "Conservatives who long have favored limited government are becoming increasingly divided over a federal crackdown on Big Tech.\n\nOn one side are right-leaning groups that think companies such as Facebook, Amazon and Google are biased against conservatives and have grown too big. On the other are the more libertarian organizations who say the push to break up Big Tech runs against traditional conservative values of limited government and individual freedoms.\n\nConservatives \u201cfeel and believe that tech leadership hates them and hates their views,\u201d said Rachel Bovard, senior adviser to the Internet Accountability Project, a right-leaning advocacy group formed last month that is pushing for the government to take on Big Tech. She said the group is also motivated by antitrust issues.\n\n\u201cOur role is to actually have these conversations on the right,\u201d said Ms. Bovard, former legislative director for Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican. \u201cThe pushback comes from the more libertarian corners of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, introduced legislation this summer that would outlaw the \u201caddictive\u201d features employed by social media companies such as autoplay and infinite scroll, and he has recently gained new allies in the form of the Internet Accountability Project.\n\nThe group, founded by Mike Davis, a former chief counsel to Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, is partnering with conservative organizations such as the Tea Party Patriots and the Conservative Partnership Institute, a think tank led by former Sen. Jim DeMint.\n\nBut the push for government intervention runs counter to traditional conservative values, said Daisy Soderberg-Rivkin, a resident fellow on the policy team at the libertarian R Street Institute.\n\nMs. Soderberg-Rivkin, a former content moderator at Google, said the \u201csplit [on the right] essentially comes from a misunderstanding of technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe scarcely had time to sit there and twiddle our thumbs and say we were going to shut up all the conservatives that were coming through,\u201d Ms. Soderberg-Rivkin said. \u201cTo say that there is some kind of conspiracy in Google or any of these tech companies to dismantle the conservatives, you [would be] really on another planet.\u201d\n\nThe Internet Accountability Project, however, portrays the leaders of Big Tech as the 21st century reincarnation of the robber barons who should spawn an \u201cantitrust revival.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are living in a new Gilded Age, only this time the Robber Barons wear hoodies and live in Silicon Valley,\u201d the group writes on its website. \u201cToday, Swamp Conservatives who leap to Big Tech\u2019s defense are mostly taking Big Money from Big Tech. They may call themselves Conservatives but their paychecks are coming from Silicon Valley.\u201d\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg did not sport a hoodie at Georgetown University Thursday when he delivered remarks dismissing allegations of political bias at Facebook. He did endorse the view that the government needs to create new rules affecting his company\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cMy view is that for each of the specific issues that come up, there are things that the platform[s] have a role in and things that the government has a role in,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe need to do our part to address the issues, we need to work with government to actually put in place rules on the real issues, and if that happens, then I basically don\u2019t think that people will end up concluding that breaking up the [tech] companies is the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nMr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify next week before the House Financial Services Committee about Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency project, but Congress has already begun deliberating about internet rules and regulations. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Tennessee Republican, chairwoman of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s tech task force and a vocal critic of Big Tech, held a closed-door meeting with policy experts Wednesday.\n\nMaureen Ohlhausen, former acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission and one of the experts at the meeting, said in an email that the topics the committee discussed included \u201cthe need to give the FTC more authority and resources to strengthen its current privacy enforcement, the benefits of a uniform federal privacy standard, and the need to ensure that new obligations don\u2019t reduce competition.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
