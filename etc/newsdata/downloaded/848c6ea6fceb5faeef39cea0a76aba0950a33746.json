Previously, any account with over 100,000 subscribers could request to become verified, but now verification will rest on two pillars: authenticity and prominence. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe company gave some shape to those terms, noting that it will verify accounts belonging to a \"real creator, artist, public figure, or company\" and those who are \"well-known or highly searched, widely recognized outside of YouTube,\" for instance. YouTube will also proactively verify accounts, deemphasizing the application process.\n\nThe shift will give verified channels a meaningful seal of approval from YouTube and create a class of more readily obvious brand-safe channels as a result. The check-mark has long served as a sort of stamp of approval across social media platforms. However, as YouTube's user base grew and channels proliferated \u2014 the site touts 2 billion monthly users, and the number of channels with a million subscribers doubled in 2018 \u2014 hitting 100,000 followers became more achievable for more channels.\n\nBut not all of these channels were necessarily authentic: For instance, some parody and gossip channels reached verification-level followership, even though they didn't represent a specific company or popular actor, and don't necessarily produce the content YouTube wants to promote. To that end, YouTube could be hitting the reset button so it can more easily boost creators it deems authentic, reliable, and ultimately brand safe. These changes come as the platform makes a sweeping series of changes to combat challenges that have alienated users, brands, and regulators alike, ranging from violent and extremist to content to children's privacy violations.\n\nWhile this might benefit YouTube, advertisers, and very popular creators, it could harm smaller but still popular YouTubers \u2014 in fact, the move is already drawing concern among that group. While YouTube indicated that some artists will still get to host a designated musical note beside their username, for instance, those who don't post music and don't meet the new overall standards risk losing their verification.\n\nThat might feel like a slap in the face for this group: For instance, YouTuber Sierra Schultzzie tweeted, \"Been doing Youtube for 5 years, I post 2 videos a week 950,000 subscribers\u2026 YouTube emails me today that my channel has been 'unverified' because the verified badge is only for well known channels with a large following.\" Further, this could have the unintended consequence of enabling imitator accounts, looking to steal engagement from recently unverified influencers: Without the verification check-mark, channels will no longer be as easily distinguishable from copycats creating similar handles.\n\nThis move is likely to contribute to an already growing frustration among certain YouTubers that the platform simply does not have their best interests in mind. Without verification, the accounts could face a tacit demonetization in that YouTube's algorithms will likely prioritize verified accounts above unverified channels.\n\nIf that happens, creators who have invested years building a career on the platform, like Schultzzie, could increasingly spend time on or even jump ship to competing platforms, like TikTok or Twitch. It seems that YouTube deemed this a worthy risk in its overall strategy toward cleaning up its platform and reorganizing its community, but discouraging smaller creators \u2014 which might also mean newer creators with high-potential \u2014 could prove to be a step in the wrong direction.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
