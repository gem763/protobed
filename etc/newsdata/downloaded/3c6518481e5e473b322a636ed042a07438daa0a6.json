Following the announcement much outrage and teeth-gnashing was to be found. The level of histrionics over an actress playing a role is rather amusing.\n\n\"Falling in love\" with the person responsible for Section 28, dead miners, and the utter obliteration of working class communities.

That woman established an era whose horrors we are still facing nowadays, and publicly supported the coup d'etat in Chile and a murderer and dictator like Pinochet.
