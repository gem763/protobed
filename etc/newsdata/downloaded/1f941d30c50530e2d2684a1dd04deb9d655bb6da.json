The hard part is managing your friends.\u201d\n\nMark Penn, Clinton\u2019s pollster: \u201cIf you can keep it operating, if you can make decisions and prove to people that you can supply the product or function, then even if you\u2019re guilty on some of it, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nJulian Epstein, chief Democratic counsel for the House Judiciary Committee: \u201cAll this stuff about cigars and all the other gratuitous sexual things were absurd. The foolishness of Starr and the Republicans not to see how the sexual material in the report would backfire was just jaw-dropping to us.\u201d\n\n\u2014Saahil Desai\n\nWhat Else We\u2019re Watching\n\n(Eduardo Munoz / Reuters)\n\nThe future of peace negotiations in Afghanistan is troubled. After a year of failed U.S.-led negotiations with the Taliban, the Afghan National Security Adviser says he wants his government to handle a new peace deal, a process that might be complicated by an election year. Kathy Gilsinan spoke with Hamdullah Mohib, shortly after his United Nations speech last week.\n\nCongress to Court: If the White House tries to stonewall House committees now, Congress should go to court, Garrett Epps argues: \u201cA president, his congressional opponents, foreign leaders, and the U.S. Supreme Court first tangled over executive privilege toward the end of George Washington\u2019s first term. They are almost certainly headed for a collision again in 2019.\u201d\n\nSnapshot\n\n(Mike Blake / Reuters)\n\nAmerica\u2019s first cannabis cafe opened in West Hollywood, California, today.\n\nFeatured Read\n\n(J. SCOTT APPLEWHITE / AP / CARLOS BARRIA / REUTERS / THE ATLANTIC)\n\nWhile the number of kid-focused publications covering politics has dwindled since the Clinton-impeachment era, existing ones must still embark on journalistic endeavors that require a bit of finessing.\n\nWhen [Andrea] Delbanco and a few of Time for Kids\u2019 other high-level editors gathered to write the piece, they debated how much detail to include about the allegations of wrongdoing against Joe Biden and his son. In their discussions, they also nixed an infographic format that would have framed the impeachment as a sort of flowchart or choose-your-own-adventure scenario. (\u201cToo many confusing possibilities,\u201d Delbanco said.)\n\nWhat\u2019s easier to explain to kids, sex acts or extortion?
