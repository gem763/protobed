Average head grades for silver and gold were 219 g/t and 1.4 g/t, 8 percent and 14 percent below budget respectively. The decrease in silver and gold production during the third quarter is mainly due to scheduled mine production activities at lower grade stopes which is in line with the mine\u2019s production program for the quarter. Silver and gold production for the first nine months of 2019 totaled 5.9 million ounces and 36,887 ounces respectively; being 1 percent above and 7 percent below the mine\u2019s nine month projection. Annual production of gold and silver at the San Jose Mine is expected to be within the 2019 annual production guidance of between 7.3 to 8.1 million ounces of silver and between 49 to 54 thousand ounces of gold (refer to Fortuna news release dated January 17, 2019 ).\n\nThe San Jose Mine cash cost per tonne for the third quarter of 2019 is US$70.8; slightly above the annual guidance range due to higher ground support costs and increased mine contractor tariffs. Cash cost per tonne for the year is expected to be within the high end of the annual guidance range (refer to Fortuna news release dated January 17, 2019 ).\n\nCaylloma Mine, Peru\n\nThe Caylloma Mine produced 228,168 ounces of silver in the third quarter of 2019, 1 percent above budget. The average silver head grade of 64 g/t was 3 percent above budget. Silver production for the first nine months of 2019 totaled 692,005 ounces; 1 percent above the mine\u2019s nine month projection.\n\nLead and zinc production in the third quarter of 2019 was 7,157,229 pounds and 11,517,861 pounds respectively, 9 percent and 9 percent above budget respectively. The average head grades for lead and zinc were 2.68 % and 4.35 %, 9 percent and 11 percent above budget respectively. Base metals production for the first nine months of 2019 totaled 21,304,857 pounds of lead and 33,986,132 pounds of zinc; being 2 percent and 8 percent above the mine\u2019s nine month projection.\n\nThe Caylloma Mine cash cost per tonne for the third quarter of 2019 is US$93.0; 5 percent above the annual guidance range due to timing of indirect costs related to processing plant maintenance. Cash cost per tonne for the year is expected to be within the high end of the annual guidance range (refer to Fortuna news release dated January 17, 2019 ).\n\nQualified Person\n\nAmri Sinuhaji, Technical Services Director \u2013 Mine Planning, is the Qualified Person for Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. as defined by National Instrument 43-101.
