A wee bit.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year-old\u2019s inclusion in an otherwise-unchanged starting side from that which beat Ireland adds an extra dimension to the All Blacks lineout and some additional size in the collision area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s strategic, not on form because Sam has been playing lovely rugby,\u201d Hansen said.\n\n\u201cHowever we have made some decisions on what we want to do and how we want to play and that means we have made the change because of it.\u201d\n\nPatrick Tuipulotu will come onto the bench as the specialist lock replacement. Cane\u2019s move to the bench has meant there was no place for Shannon Frizell, who had been tipped to replace the injured Matt Todd as loose forward cover.\n\nTodd injured his shoulder against Ireland and Hansen ruled him out of contention for the semi-final earlier in the week.\n\nAll Blacks captain Kieran Read, who missed training earlier in the week with a calf muscle injury, was named for his 126th test.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s good. Really good,\u201d Hansen said.\n\n\u201cYou want another one? He\u2019s really really good.\u201d\n\nHansen also retained his young backline, which has an average age of 25, and will be anchored by Beauden Barrett at fullback and Richie Mo\u2019unga at flyhalf in the dual-playmaker role the coach has preferred over the last 18 months.\n\nSonny Bill Williams will again come off the bench to provide some punch in the midfield in the second half.\n\nEngland name their team later on Thursday.\n\nTeam: 15-Beauden Barrett, 14-Sevu Reece, 13-Jack Goodhue, 12-Anton Lienert-Brown, 11-George Bridge, 10-Richie Mo\u2019unga, 9-Aaron Smith, 8-Kieran Read (captain), 7-Ardie Savea, 6-Scott Barrett, 5-Sam Whitelock, 4-Brodie Retallick, 3-Nepo Laulala, 2-Codie Taylor, 1-Joe Moody\n\nReplacements: 16-Dane Coles, 17-Ofa Tuungafasi, 18-Angus Ta\u2019avao, 19-Patrick Tuipulotu, 20-Sam Cane, 21-TJ Perenara, 22-Sonny Bill Williams, 23-Jordie Barrett.", "description": "Scott Barrett has been surprisingly named to start at blindside flanker for New Zealand in their Rugby World Cup semi-final against England on Saturday, with Ardie Savea shifting to the openside of the scrum.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444342960&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N06H", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
