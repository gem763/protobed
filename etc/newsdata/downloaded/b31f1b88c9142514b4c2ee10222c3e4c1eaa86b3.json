He was fired Monday after a nearly lifeless 0-5 start to the season and replaced by Bill Callahan on an interim basis. Add Gruden to this list of Snyder\u2019s coaches who, to varying degrees, had unpleasant or downright embarrassing stints trying to right the franchise.\n\nNorv Turner, 1994-2000 (49-59-1)\n\nTurner was already entrenched when Snyder bought the team in 1999, but with the Redskins at 7-6 in 2000, the new owner fired him.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the opportunity that Dan Snyder gave me. I don\u2019t think anyone can question his passion, how badly he wants to win,\u201d Turner said at the time. Terry Robiskie finished out the final three games of 2000 in Turner\u2019s place, the last time Washington had an in-season firing and an interim coach until Gruden and Callahan.\n\nMarty Schottenheimer, 2001 (8-8)\n\nHis single year with the Redskins was the least illustrious stint in Schottenheimer\u2019s famous coaching career. This was the last time Washington started a season 0-5 before this year, but to Schottenheimer\u2019s credit, they followed the five straight losses with five straight wins. Still, Snyder fired him to make room for an even bigger name.\n\nSteve Spurrier, 2002-2003 (12-20)\n\nSpurrier signed what was the most expensive coaching contract in NFL history at the time \u2014 five years, $25 million. A Redskins coach lasting five years? Yes, it was too good to be true. Spurrier resigned after two. Earlier this year, Spurrier said in an interview that he \u201cdid a lousy job\u201d in Washington \u2014 but also that \u201cthe GM did a lousy job. He happened to be the owner, so who needed to go?\u201d\n\nJoe Gibbs, 2004-2007 (30-34)\n\nGibbs should be remembered by fans for coaching the Redskins to three Super Bowl titles with three different starting quarterbacks. His second stint in Washington started off well enough \u2014 his team went 10-6 in his second year and even won a playoff game, a remarkable concept. But after a second playoff appearance in 2007, Gibbs re-retired.\n\nJim Zorn, 2008-2009 (12-20)\n\nYes, the man who leaped from Seattle quarterbacks coach to Washington head coach and called the Redskins\u2018 colors \u201cmaroon, black and yellow\u201d at his introductory press conference ended up with a record identical to the two-year stint of the Ol\u2019 Ball Coach, a College Football Hall of Famer. After several years out of coaching, Zorn has taken over the XFL team in Seattle.\n\nMike Shanahan, 2010-2013 (24-40)\n\nRemove 2012 from the equation, and Shanahan\u2019s Redskins went a combined 14-34 and placed last in the NFC East every year. Robert Griffin III\u2019s sensational rookie season gave fans hope and made Shanahan look great, but the quarterback hurt his ACL and LCL, made it worse in the wild card game and \u2026 well, Washington fans don\u2019t need to be reminded of what happened next.\n\nJay Gruden, 2014-2019 (35-49-1)\n\nHired to \u201cfix\u201d Griffin\u2019s game, that plan was quickly abandoned and Gruden\u2019s Redskins found success with Kirk Cousins, including a playoff appearance in Gruden\u2019s second season on the job. Things have fallen apart in the years since, and while the team was beset by an unusual amount of injuries, Gruden also received criticism for deactivating Adrian Peterson in Week 1 and how he has handled rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins.\n\nGruden\u2019s .418 winning percentage is nothing to be proud of, but at five seasons plus five games, he was by far the longest-tenured coach under Snyder\u2019s rule, and perhaps that says all that needs to be said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
