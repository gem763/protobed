She can still drive \u2014 though she does worry about how she will take out her cash when the day comes when she can\u2019t.\n\nMick Mahon, 71, a retired fisherman from Grimsby, is already in that position.\n\nHe suffers from osteo-arthritis and finds it difficult to walk further than to the top of his street \u2014 let alone the two miles to his nearest bank branch.\n\nHe lives only a few yards from his local post office and dreads the day when he can no longer go there to take out his cash.\n\nBut in the eyes of Barclays\u2019 cold-hearted executives, heart-wrenching stories like these mean nothing.\n\nIndeed, they\u2019ve hardly bothered to play down the devastating impact of their new ban that comes into force in January, merely claiming that customers will still be able to request cashback from local businesses such as cafes and corner shops.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t what people like Sylvia want. And their views deserve to be heard.\n\nFor these are loyal customers who opened their accounts years before the invention of the cash machine. They even had savings and current accounts before credit cards were invented.\n\nFor those of us who have watched with dread how High Street banks have slowly abandoned the elderly and those in remote rural locations, Barclays\u2019 latest move, for all its heartlessness, hardly came as a surprise [File photo]\n\nMore importantly for Barclays, they have stuck with the bank despite its somewhat chequered past.\n\nWhen it came under fire in the 1980s from anti-racist campaigners over its continued operations in apartheid-ridden South Africa, they remained loyal.\n\nWhen Barclays was implicated in the Libor scandal \u2014 in which its traders were found guilty of rigging interest rates \u2014 they did not defect.\n\nAnd year after year, when its bosses have shamelessly continued to pay themselves eye-watering bonuses, Barclays\u2019 loyal customers have refused to jump ship.\n\nYet in return, they are being treated with breathtaking disregard \u2014 and all to save a relatively meagre amount.\n\nBut not only does Barclays\u2019 move seem incredibly callous. It also stinks of hypocrisy.\n\nFor while the bank bends over backwards to seem non-discriminatory and pander to millennials \u2014 it recently used an LGBT \u2018Pride\u2019 flag to illustrate its smartphone app \u2014 this policy has a strong whiff of ageism about it.\n\nOf course, many elderly people are perfectly comfortable using new technology and online banking. But there can be no doubt that those affected by this diktat are disproportionately elderly.\n\nAnd as a result, the bank is squandering the loyalty of some of its longest-standing customers.\n\nFor those of us who have watched with dread how High Street banks have slowly abandoned the elderly and those in remote rural locations, Barclays\u2019 latest move, for all its heartlessness, hardly came as a surprise.\n\nIn fact, it is symptomatic of a wider trend in banking that impinges on us all.\n\nAs well as being enfeebled by the financial crisis, the big High Street players have also been forced to shell out billions of pounds in fines and compensation for their misdeeds, ranging from enabling money-laundering for drugs kingpins to the PPI scandal.\n\nAnd in recent years a new threat has emerged in the form of glossy new internet-only operators.\n\nJeopardy\n\nConcerned by the rise of challenger banks such as Monzo and Revolut, Barclays and its traditional competitors are intent on shifting customers away from \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 branches, cheques and even cash.\n\nFor urban, tech-savvy customers, this is great. But for those like Sylvia, it is an act of blatant betrayal.\n\nFor while the bank bends over backwards to seem non-discriminatory and pander to millennials \u2014 it recently used an LGBT \u2018Pride\u2019 flag to illustrate its smartphone app \u2014 this policy has a strong whiff of ageism about it\n\nIn the past five years alone, Barclays has shut more than 480 branches \u2014 around a third of its network. For the bank then to prevent people using the post office to gain access to their cash simply adds insult to injury.\n\nNor is it just loyal customers who will bear the brunt of Barclays\u2019 ill-considered move.\n\nIt will also have calamitous consequences for post offices themselves, whose role at the heart of local communities is already in jeopardy.\n\nBanking services are a vital source of income for post-masters, the independent business people who run local post offices.\n\nMany are already struggling financially and this could be the last straw for some who are already on the edge. And yet, Barclays has shown no sign of contrition.\n\nThe bank\u2019s reputation is already deeply tarnished. Just this month, its former bosses appeared in court, accused of alleged fraud after Barclays attracted billions of pounds from Qatari investors.\n\nContempt\n\nMeanwhile, for all its grovelling apologies after the Libor scandal, nobody has forgotten Barclays\u2019 notorious culture of contempt for ordinary staff, customers and regulators during those dark years when it was found guilty of misdemeanour after misdemeanour.\n\nIt was driven by a bonus-hungry cabal of \u2018casino\u2019 investment bankers, who put their own interests ahead of anyone, or anything, else.\n\nNow, this dreadful decision risks plunging Barclays\u2019 name still deeper into the mire.\n\nBut it is not too late to turn back.\n\nDespite its past misdeeds, I do not for one moment think that the bank wants to be deliberately cruel to its own customers.\n\nBut I do believe the bank will never regain the trust it will lose if it turns its back on them now.\n\nJes Staley, Barclays\u2019 chief executive, should do the honourable thing and personally intervene to reverse the decision.\n\nThere is no shame in admitting a mistake. In fact, it would reflect well on the bank if it truly listened to people like Sylvia.\n\nForcing through a cash ban at post offices might save a small sum of money. But you can\u2019t put a price on customer loyalty.", "description": "RUTH SUNDERLAND:  Many elderly people are perfectly comfortable using new technology and online banking.
