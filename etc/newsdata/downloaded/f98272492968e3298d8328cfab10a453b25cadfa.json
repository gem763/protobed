However, having her daughter at the beginning of her professional soccer team, the Orlando Pride\u2019s, season wasn\u2019t always in her plan.\n\n\u201cThis year didn\u2019t really go as planned for me and my family,\u201d Leroux said. \u201cI was supposed to have a baby in March and then go on and be able to play most of the season, but we lost that baby last year.\u201d\n\nAfter her miscarriage, Leroux got pregnant again and would be due at the beginning of the Pride\u2019s season. While many said she would miss all of this season\u2019s games, Leroux knew she wanted to make it back to play this season -- at least a part of it -- like she had originally planned.\n\n\u201cMy plan was to be back this season regardless of what it looked like,\u201d Leroux said. \u201cI was going to make it happen.\u201d\n\nLeroux played while pregnant and began training again, with the blessing of her doctor, just five weeks after giving birth to her daughter.\n\n\u201cWhen you give birth your body is different,\u201d Leroux said. \u201cI still have baby weight from my pregnancy. You have to almost learn how to use your body again. It\u2019s like your mind works but your body doesn\u2019t keep up. I still feel like I have a ways to go but every day I feel stronger.\u201d\n\nAt Sunday\u2019s game Leroux walked onto the field for the first time that season with her daughter in her arms. Overwhelmed with emotion, Leroux burst into tears.\n\n\u201cIt was so emotional. It\u2019s been a hard year,\u201d Leroux said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what's so emotional for me because I went through that experience last year with my team and I was able to come back with that same group for the end of the season.\u201d\n\nNot only were her teammates supportive, Leroux said she felt the support of so many people during and after her comeback.\n\n\u201cWe had an away game and even fans from the other team were cheering for me and that was really special,\u201d Leroux said. \u201cThere\u2019s sports and then there\u2019s really life. I feel like I didn\u2019t necessarily see how hard it was because I was in it. There was a lot of support and people who read out who were really proud of me. That\u2019s always a good feeling.\u201d\n\nLeroux hopes her comeback will encourage other women who are striving for a balance between family and their careers.\n\n\u201cWe think when we have children and we start a family that we can't continue on with our dreams and our hopes and our aspirations,\u201d Leroux said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to see that life doesn\u2019t have to stop and you can have a family and have a career and be able to do them at the same time.\u201d", "description": "Professional soccer player Sydney Leroux promised herself that she would get back to the field after giving birth to her daughter no matter what it took.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/laroux-ap-er-191001_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
