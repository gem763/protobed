Artists are known for having very good and particular taste, which usually requires a bit more thought than shopping for your L.A.\u2013based aunt who will appreciate a culty back massager or your teen brother who explicitly told you he wants AirPods. And if you want to buy an artist a gift he will actually use, you\u2019ll probably have to be pretty familiar with his practice to know what supplies to get. To help keep you from wandering the aisles of Blick deliberating between that $80 tube of Michael Harding lapiz lazuli and a Kolinsky sable brush, we reached out to 13 artists \u2014 including painters, photographers, textile designers, and multimedia artists \u2014 about what sorts of gifts they\u2019d like to receive. Below, their 23 suggestions, which include something for practically every artist, whether she\u2019s hoping for supplies, an activity, shoes, or cannabis-infused snacks to \u201cinspire\u201d her creative process.\n\nArt supplies\n\nSilky Nevanon Scissors Artist Daniele Frazier recommended a gift that she received last year and loved: Teflon-coated scissors. \u201cI love them because not only do they look really beautiful but they\u2019re extremely sharp, and the Teflon coating allows you to cut tape, even gummy tape like duct tape, without the scissors getting sticky over time,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody really buys herself fancy scissors, but we all know the gross feeling of a pair of scissors that has been used too often on packing tape, which is what makes these a nice gift.\u201d These scissors are made in Japan and built to last, meaning their recipient can hold on to them for a while. \u201cI think giving someone something that will last a lifetime is not only thoughtful but responsible,\u201d says Frazier. $27 at Amazon Buy $27 at Amazon Buy\n\nHahnem\u00fchle FineArt Baryta Paper \u201cAs a photographer, I\u2019m always in need of photo paper to make tests and final prints with,\u201d says Elliott Jerome Brown Jr., who names Hahnem\u00fchle FineArt Baryta as his favorite. \u201cIt comes in a variety of sizes, in both sheets and rolls,\u201d he says. If you\u2019re confused about what size paper to buy, we suggest looking at the dimensions of recipient\u2019s past work as a starting point. $110 at Amazon Buy $110 at Amazon Buy\n\nKrink K-70 Permanent Ink Marker, Black \u201cPeople always ask me which pens I use, [and I tell them] I\u2019ve been using Krink for years,\u201d says Shantell Martin. \u201cThey\u2019re really smooth, the quality of their ink is amazing, and you can use them on anything from clothing and leather to walls for larger murals.\u201d Krink paint markers also happen to be on the desk of Sant Ambroeus creative director Alireza Niroomand, who likes them in blue and who told us that \u201cwhen I want to scribble, I have one on me.\u201d $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nBaron Fig Confidant Notebook Martin also suggested a Baron Fig notebook, a style we\u2019re very familiar with after our big test of 100 notebooks. \u201cI think Baron is doing a great job with both quality and a modern approach to the world of creative stationery,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir journals and notebooks always make me want to plan, create, and succeed.\u201d And if you need any further convincing, the Strategist also named Baron Fig notebooks as the best back in 2015, when it was a print-only operation. $18 at Baron Fig Buy\n\nFramebridge Providence Frame \u201cEvery artist always has a piece or two that needs to be framed,\u201d says Kent Monkman, whose work for the Met was recently featured on Vulture. \u201cFind a good local shop and get them a gift certificate for framing services they wouldn\u2019t spend themselves.\u201d You could also try ordering through Framebridge, a framing company that we tested and found to be one of the best online framing services out there. $85 at Framebridge Buy\n\nBooks\n\nThe Journal of Eugene Delacroix If you want to give your artist friend a gift that delves into the life of an artist of another era, Monkman recommends The Journal of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. \u201cDelacroix\u2019s personal journal offers an amazing insight into the artist\u2019s life and is an incredible resource for any painter,\u201d Monkman told us. \u201cIn his own words, Delacroix describes his insights on techniques such as color theory and his use of both live models and daguerreotypes as references.\u201d He says the journal also offers a \u201cjuicy look\u201d into the 19th-century painter\u2019s personal life, recounting affairs, opinions of other artists, and what life was like in the 19th-century Parisian artistic scene. \u201cI enjoy the moments where he offers his thoughts on art, like, \u2018The things that are most real to me are the illusions which I create with my painting. Everything else is quicksand,\u2019\u201d says Monkman. $7 at Amazon Buy $7 at Amazon Buy\n\nEarly Rubens Monkman also told us about this exhibition catalogue by Sasha Suda and Kirk Nickel, which would make a great gift for Rubens fans and those interested in the Old Masters. \u201cThe catalogue contains examples of the beautiful Baroque imagery for which this master is known but is also a good resource for those wanting a more in-depth look at Rubens\u2019s practice as an artist,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are descriptions of the particulars of his studio practice, such as his workshop techniques and collaboration with other artists.\u201d Monkman notes that the catalogue also offers insights into the artist\u2019s business and shows how Ruben created a brand for himself and branched out commercially. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to compare Rubens\u2019s historical precedent to modern artistic practices,\u201d he adds. $29 at Amazon Buy $29 at Amazon Buy\n\nAmerican Origami by Andres Gonzalez \u201cRecently I fell in love with the design of American Origami by Andres Gonzalez,\u201d says Brown. \u201cAt first, it appears to operate like a traditionally bound book, but at some point towards the middle I noticed that each of the pages folds back and out to reveal a different combination of information.\u201d Brown notes that the material used for the pages is similar to that of stationery folders and collapses into a pile the way a perforated tax document would. It\u2019s a serious gift: \u201cThe book itself is a compilation of information on various school shootings, which I learned when looking up the information for the book,\u201d Brown says. But for an artist, its appeal might lie in the construction of the book as an object: \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly thick book, so when I first picked it up, I sought to experience the design and would engage content later,\u201d he says. $75 at Light Work Buy\n\nTrinkets and gadgets\n\nCCKW Nugget Keychain \u201cA fun stocking stuffer that I give as a gift all the time are these little nuggets made by my old studio mates Chen Chen and Kai Williams,\u201d says ceramicist Helen Levi. \u201cEach one is completely different, and I love integrating a piece of art into the banal everyday.\u201d CCKW also makes stylish pens, bottle openers, and candleholders that would all make reasonably priced gifts for a design-minded recipient. You could try the stacked porcelain planter the pair designed that has since been licensed to and manufactured by Areaware \u2014 and named the next status planter by us. $28 at CCKW Buy\n\nArtist, filmmaker, and poet Himali Singh Soin told us that she regularly gives friends compasses and hourglasses as gifts. \u201cThe compass is for space, the hourglass is for time,\u201d she says. \u201cThese are the two fundamental qualities that any artist will encounter along the way.\u201d Soin loves these objects because they are \u201ccurious in their shape and form\u201d and can be a reminder to artists that time is arbitrary. \u201cWhole worlds may form in the span of one round of sand spilling in an hourglass \u2014 sometimes the compass can leave us asunder and in fact the spleen or the stars, our natural navigators, can point us in the right direction,\u201d she says. Soin suggests looking for these items at vintage markets (or on Etsy), but there are plenty of affordable ones online, too.\n\nTeenage Engineering Portable OP-1 Synthesizer For something more interactive, Martin suggests this portable synthesizer, which will let curious artists noodle around in a new medium. \u201cI love how the team at Teenage Engineering is creating amazing products that are super-modern but also strike some great emotional nostalgia chords,\u201d Martin says. \u201cAs an artist I love exploring other mediums that I can create my work with and venturing into music has been really fun for me, especially with my OP1.\u201d $1,299 at Teenage Engineering Buy\n\nClothing and accessories\n\nPhoto: Retailer Maryam Nassir Zadeh Isa Pumps $251 at Shopbop Buy\n\n\u201cI would say the best gift for an artist would be a pair of Maryam Nassir Zadeh shoes and a handbag,\u201d says fashion designer and artist Susan Cianciolo (who often models for the designer). \u201cSince all her shoes, bags, and makeup are so colorful and a very original color range, they remind me of an artist\u2019s palette and [the time I spend] painting in my studio.\u201d\n\nMAKE Celeste e Verde Palette Cianciolo also told us about the makeup palette the designer created with MAKE, which includes powder-blue and lemon-yellow shades that the artist calls \u201cfantastic.\u201d $40 at MAKE Beauty Buy\n\nOlivia Wendel Animal Kingdom Scarf Amna Asghar also suggests giving an artist art in the form of something that can be worn or admired every day. Asghar told us that she\u2019s had her eye on this hand-painted silk scarf by artist Olivia Wendel. \u201cWendel has a series of collections \u2014 Flora and Fauna being my favorite,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are vibrant and lush, dense with imagery from edge to edge. A great gift for an artist that can be worn in multiple ways as well as hung on the wall to live with every day.\u201d Wendel also makes blankets and pillows, should your artist be more into home goods than scarves. $95 at Olivia Wendel Buy\n\nFancy provisions\n\nUtopia California Cannabis Assorted Macaroons \u201cArtists really need cash or art supplies, but besides that, I recommend Utopia Cannabis\u2019s macaroons,\u201d says artist and poet Samuel Jablon. The macaroons are non-GMO, vegan, paleo, and gluten-free, and according to Jablon would be a much-appreciated way to help your artist friend chill out before a show. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unknowns preparing for shows that have no guarantees, everything is always on the line, you just have to live off belief and hard work,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing life, but these are delicious and a great way to cut through stress.\u201d $20 at Leafly Buy\n\nDomaine de la Romanee-Conti la Tache And if you really want to splurge, take a note from Ebecho Muslimova: \u201cWhile exposure and ideas are the best gifts you can give to an artist, I would also settle for a bottle of Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti la T\u00e2che,\u201d she says. $3,795 at Maison du Prix Buy\n\nExperiential gifts\n\nThe Criterion Channel Streaming Subscription Painter Cassi Namoda (who also gave us some tips about the best white button-downs) told us that she would gift another artist a subscription to the Criterion Collection\u2019s streaming service. \u201cI recently got it for my household,\u201d she says. \u201cMy partner and I are both artists, and it just opened another world for me. I watched Several Friends by Charles Burnett and it inspired me so profoundly.\u201d $99 at The Criterion Channel Buy\n\nPhoto: Retailer Metrograph Gift Card If the artist lives in New York, you can follow Jeanette Hayes\u2019s advice and gift them a membership or gift card to a theater. \u201cI believe that a huge part of being an artist is researching and learning and studying all forms of art,\u201d Hayes told us. \u201cThat being said, there are loads of fun gifts that any artist would appreciate. If you\u2019re in New York, a gift card to the Metrograph theater is a treat anyone would love, but especially an artist. Whether someone uses it to see some great films or uses it in the book shop, it\u2019s a win-win.\u201d From $50 at Metrograph Buy\n\nMono No Aware Film Workshop If your artist friend is interested in a more hands-on film experience, artist Yto Barrada suggests gifting a workshop session at Mono No Aware, which she calls one of her \u201ctreasured places\u201d in New York. \u201cMono No Aware in Brooklyn is one of the rare places left in the world to learn analogue moving-image techniques,\u201d she says. From $50 at Mono No Aware Buy\n\nMembership at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Another great option for New York\u2013based artists is a yearlong museum membership. \u201cMy pick would be the Met,\u201d says Hayes. \u201cThe Met is still pay whatever you like for New York residents, but when you\u2019re a member, you get to go during members-only hours, and that\u2019s pretty fun. And quiet! Any artist would appreciate this.\u201d If you\u2019re buying the membership for an artist who doesn\u2019t live in New York and you really like them, Hayes has a another suggestion: \u201cConsider buying them a ticket to New York City.\u201d Should you go this route, you might want to direct them toward a highly rated but affordable hotel \u2014 we dove into some of the best in Brooklyn. From $80 at Metropolitan Museum of Art Buy\n\nZeel Massage on Demand \u201cMy mother usually gives me a gift certificate for a massage around the holidays since the lead-up to Christmas is so crazy busy in my line of work,\u201d says Levi, who told us she looks forward to the massage gift card all year. Her favorite place to go locally is Melt in Fort Greene, but if you\u2019re buying for someone who lives farther afield and aren\u2019t sure about where to send them, Zeel\u2019s service allows you to book at-home massages no matter where you live. $50 at Zeel Buy $50 at Zeel Buy\n\nPhoto: Retailer Cameo Celebrity Greeting If you\u2019re looking for a truly personal experiential gift, artist Stewart Uoo suggests the one he says he\u2019s been giving recently. \u201cLately I\u2019ve been really into hiring celebrities to send unexpected personal messages to people on Cameo.com. I like to give gifts that are moments that don\u2019t last forever.\u201d This one could make a fun gift for just about anyone \u2014 for $100, you can send your friend a personalized greeting from Heidi Montag or, for a cool $52, Perez Hilton. From $20 at Cameo Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
