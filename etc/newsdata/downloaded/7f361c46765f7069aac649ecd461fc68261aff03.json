It would never have reached the surface of the Earth [intact from space].\n\n\"It's in good nick, the solar panels look a bit bent but it didn't land at high speeds.\"\n\nCara Delevingne is not the first person to capture a space selfie. Astronauts Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin have taken photographs of themselves in space - and the Curiosity Rover took photos of itself on the surface of Mars.", "description": "A device that crashed in the US was from a Samsung publicity campaign offering to send selfies into space.", "authors": ["Zoe Kleinman", "Technology Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16D8E/production/_109428539_samsung-spaceselfie_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
