Sometimes it came naturally; sometimes the knowledge was hard-won. Other times, it\u2019s because they asked, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d and I somehow figured out what to tell them.\n\nBut it\u2019s not always so easy for people in the midst of a crisis to say what they need \u2014 or to even know, for that matter.\n\n\u201cProbably every woman talks about this at some point over the course of her cancer treatment,\u201d says Mary Jane Massie, M.D., a psychiatrist with Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, where her focus is women with breast cancer. \u201cI think the offer to help is a statement of love and affection \u2014 so take the affection \u2014 and know it\u2019s OK to say, \u2018this is kind of way too much,\u2019 and \u2018I don\u2019t even know what I need.\u2019\u201d\n\nMassie adds that going through a crisis such as breast cancer is how many people learn what their friends are really made of. \u201cSometimes the people who we thought were peripheral to us turn out to be the kindest, most helpful and most thoughtful \u2014 and our so-called friends turn out to be the people who say, \u2018if you need anything, I am totally there for you, call me day or night,\u2019\u201d but are then never actually available when push comes to shove.\n\nSome women so dread that disappearing act that they opt to keep news of their diagnosis to themselves. \u201cThey say, \u2018I realize if I don\u2019t tell people I won\u2019t get support \u2014 but if I do, then I have to risk being very disappointed in them,\u2019\u201d Massie says.\n\nAccording to the book How to Be a Friend to a Friend Who\u2019s Sick, which longtime author and activist (and founding editor of Ms. magazine) Letty Cottin Pogrebin wrote following her own struggle with breast cancer, knowing how to be a good friend in tough times isn\u2019t always instinctual.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you already know how to \u2018be friends\u2019 when it means catching up over lunch, sitting side by side at a ball game, or texting each other about a movie,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut when a pal or loved one falters physically or mentally \u2014 when they\u2019re hobbled or hurting, when your role in the relationship is no longer easy or obvious, when your interests and exchanges are not entirely reciprocal, and your once-easy conversation tips jarringly toward matters of crisis and pain \u2014 you may have to find new ways of being together, new means for you to be helpful, and new words to keep things real.\u201d\n\nTo gather more specifics, in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I decided to take a page from Pogrebin\u2019s book, by crowdsourcing for some advice from women who have gone through it \u2014 both friends and acquaintances, as well as women in private Facebook support groups I belong to, about what to say and do (or not) when a friend tells you she has breast cancer.", "description": "Try to think of these nuggets of wisdom as suggestions \u2014 not as edicts or threats designed to freak you into silence. Most people just want to know that you\u2019re there, and that you care.", "authors": ["Beth Greenfield", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Peg8U7xCHP6GWhjPcuTdqA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/9b1df460-e6ed-11e9-bffa-711d022bae9e", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
