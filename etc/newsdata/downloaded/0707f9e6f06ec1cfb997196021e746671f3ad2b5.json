We don\u2019t want to go there and end up with another defeat.\n\n\u201cWe want to win and get us back on a winning streak. It\u2019s up to us to bounce back. If you can\u2019t get up for a game for your country, you\u2019re in the wrong game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll prepare as if it\u2019s a qualifier and it\u2019s up to us to go and get a win.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill will have an eye on next month\u2019s final qualifiers as he prepares his team. Northern Ireland will face Holland in Belfast before heading to Frankfurt for their final Group C fixtures.\n\nIf Northern Ireland win both of those games they could still qualify automatically, but March\u2019s play-offs look to be their best bet now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big ask,\u201d Dallas added. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really talked much about the play-offs.\n\n\u201cWe set out at the start of the group to give ourselves a chance to progress. We\u2019ve played so, so well in these last two games and haven\u2019t got anything out of it.\n\nMichael O\u00b4Neill\u00b4s side may have to battle through the play-offs (John Walton/PA)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cruel game at times and unfortunately we are on the wrong end of two results.\n\n\u201cAs for the group now, if we go and win our two games we give ourselves a great chance but you have to beat two of the best teams in the world to do that.\u201d\n\nThe full 23-man Northern Ireland squad flew to Prague on Saturday with no withdrawals from the original group, though a number of regulars will expect to have little or no involvement in the fixture.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Michael will rotate it a little bit, freshen things up,\u201d captain Steven Davis said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to give other members of the squad some experience of international football as well to try and build for the future.\u201d", "description": "Northern Ireland slipped to a 3-1 defeat to Holland on Thursday.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/11/wire-19623714-1570876438-872_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
