That\u2019s the ludicrous intended message of summoning parliament to sit on a Saturday, echoing the eve of battle in 1939. It also recalls the Suez crisis \u2013 and that\u2019s a more apt Brexit comparison, this maverick act of hubris, the last hurrah of empire, leading to national humiliation.\n\nThe Saturday theatrical show is meant to shine a spotlight on the scene where Boris Johnson is forced by traitors to sign a surrender letter to the EU enemy to beg for more time. But wait! In the last act the people will set our hero free from these parliamentary villains when a general election resoundingly acclaims him as the leader to take them out of the EU and into the promised land.\n\nBrexit: Boris Johnson to meet Leo Varadkar for last-ditch talks Read more\n\nBut while that election looks certain, a Johnson victory does not at all. The Labour shadow cabinet this week expressed rumbling nerves \u2013 low in the polls, their leader even lower \u2013 after a conference overshadowed by continuing left faction plotting. Despite all that, look to the other side and see a party in a far greater existential crisis.\n\nJohnson frames this as the Brexit showdown election, yet he has just boxed himself into a corner where his own policy is confusing, duplicitous and rightly untrusted by both sides of his Brexit-split party. He has just promised his 80 One Nation moderates that his manifesto will pledge a deal, with no deal only as a default. But there is no deal for him to sell, however much he blusters that the EU will yield to him once he is victorious. It won\u2019t, and it will be clear throughout the election if he tries to outline some fantasy settlement, while Nigel Farage shouts for a \u201cClean Brexit now\u201d \u2013 there can be no more flannelling. In fear of Farage, watch Johnson follow Dominic Cummings\u2019 lead, converting the Tories into a no-deal Brexit party. Do that and he faces instant schism, with walkouts not just by those 80 MPs but also propelling a large slice of his One Nation voters into the eager arms of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nAgainst these no dealers, Jeremy Corbyn and his party are united and authentically passionate, in a way they haven\u2019t been for years. Corbyn can convincingly admit he was never an EU enthusiast, but like many who saw the options unfold, he stands unequivocally against the great no-deal disaster. Vote for us, and we give you the final say: remain, or a deal that keeps us in the customs union \u2013 as near as damn it in the single market \u2013 with no border in Ireland. Vote Tory and it\u2019s no deal. Vote Liberal Democrat and it\u2019s an undemocratic revoke.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018On both Brexit and state-of-the-nation policies, Jeremy Corbyn has the strongest platform.\u2019 Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA\n\nThe danger is in splitting the remain vote. Everything depends on remainers and progressives voting tactically with rigid discipline in each of 150 target seats to keep Johnson out, opting for the best-chance Labour, Lib Dem, Green, SNP or Plaid Cymru candidate.\n\nLabour people may jibe at Jo Swinson\u2019s behaviour. Why is she so rudely adamant that she would never back a Corbyn-led government, not even as interim? For the good reason that grown-up Labour supporters need to understand: the seats she can win are virtually all Tory ones and the soft Tory remainers she needs to woo would be frightened off if voting Lib Dem looked like a proxy Corbyn vote. She needs to be as brutally aggressive towards Labour as possible \u2013 and Labour people just have to suck it up: the only hope of Labour being the bigger party is for Swinson to win every Tory seat she can.\n\nAny top-down deal between the parties in an election would be fatal \u2013 but local campaigners in both parties are already targeting their resources wisely: in places like St Ives and Lewes, Labour campaigns elsewhere. In Beaconsfield, the Lib Dems are preparing to stand down for Dominic Grieve\u2019s run as an independent. Swinson will surely never go into coalition with anyone again, but in a hung parliament, with Labour the biggest party, she would clearly agree to back Labour policies that the Lib Dems favour, and block those they oppose.\n\nJohnson and Cummings will have their grid plan for each day of the election \u2013 it will be Brexit, Brexit, Brexit all the way. But on strategy and tactics their record so far is 100% failure. In a five-week, 24/7 media campaign, stuff happens. Unwelcome subjects spring out unexpectedly. The public confronts candidates with real-life questions: Johnson, the supposed people-pleasing great campaigner, has proved awkward and alarmed when confronted with anyone but adorers seeking selfies. Will they try to keep him in bubblewrap, like Theresa May in 2017, scuttling in the back door to closed venues packed with party workers, with no questions from journalists?\n\nHe pretends to want to talk about the NHS, the police and hospitals \u2013 but so will the people and he won\u2019t like what he hears after a decade of stricken services. Nor will voters trust his airy promises of more money when all around everything appears to be getting worse \u2013 NHS waiting times lengthening as local authorities set their threadbare budgets for even deeper cuts.\n\nCorbyn, on the other hand, campaigns well. He needs a better speechwriter to frame the Brexit debate beyond repetitive mantras on environmental and workers rights. But on both Brexit and state-of-the-nation policies, he has the strongest platform.\n\nNo election has ever been so uncertain, says Professor Rob Ford, political scientist. The irony is that our first past the post system, supposed to deliver certainty, is the most destabilising possible in a four-party landscape. \u201cTiny shifts in votes can upset an avalanche of seats, with no relation between the national vote and number of seats won. It\u2019s a butterfly effect, a small flap of wings setting off chaos down the line,\u201d says Ford. Combine that with this week\u2019s British Election Study finding far a more volatile electorate and you get uncertainty that makes all current opinion polls almost meaningless.\n\nMay entered her 2017 election 20 points ahead and concluded it by losing her majority \u2013 so much for her \u201cstrong and stable\u201d campaign. Never underestimate Boris Johnson\u2019s ability to crash and burn whenever forced to confront the real world, the EU or the entire electorate.\n\n\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Across the country, opponents of a no-deal Brexit are marshalling forces to stymie the PM, says Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee", "authors": ["Polly Toynbee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42f41b03638e66734dbbe7994fb6b7b71052a8d6/0_104_2418_1451/master/2418.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b9ca353ab991ad00bbd8d57aed43d4a3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
