Ilhan Omar shared Wednesday where she was during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks after coming under scrutiny for referring to 9/11 as \u201csome people did something.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn September 11th we experienced one of the most horrific terrorist attacks that we have ever lived through as a nation,\u201d Ms. Omar, Minnesota Democrat, tweeted. \u201cToday, we remember the victims, the first responders and their loved ones. #Neverforget.\u201d\n\nIn the tweeted video, the congresswoman said, \u201cI was 18 years old when that happened. I was in a classroom in college, and I remember rushing home after being dismissed and getting home and seeing my father in complete horror as he sat in front of that TV. And I remember just feeling like the world was ending.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe events of 9/11 were life-changing, life-altering for all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cMy feeling around it is one of complete horror. None of us are ever going to forget that day and the trauma that we will always have to live with.\u201d\n\nMs. Omar\u2019s recollection comes a few months after she was scrutinized by conservatives earlier this year for referring to the terrorist attacks as \u201csome people did something.\u201d\n\nDuring a speech at the 9/11 memorial on Wednesday, a son of one of the nearly 3,000 killed wore a shirt with Ms. Omar\u2019s words and called out the Muslim congresswoman for her statement.\n\n\u201d \u2018Some people did something,\u2019 said a freshman congresswoman from Minnesota to support and justify the creation of CAIR,\u201d Nicholas Haros Jr. said. \u201cToday I am here to respond to you, exactly who did what to whom.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn that day, 19 Islamic terrorist members of al Qaeda killed over 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars of economic damage. Is that clear?\u201d he continued. \u201cBut as to whom, I was attacked. Your relatives and friends were attacked. Our constitutional freedoms were attacked. And our nation\u2019s founding on Judeo-Christian principles were attacked. That\u2019s what some people did. Got that now?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Jessica Chasmar contributed to this article.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
