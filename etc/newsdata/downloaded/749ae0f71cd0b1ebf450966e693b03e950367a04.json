The report was published on Wednesday.\n\nASIO last year had annual budget of A$533.4 million ($361.91 million) and employed more than 1,900 people.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, said that ASIO would get more money and that staffing would rise to more than 2,000 people.\n\n\u201cIt is getting unprecedented funding and we will continue to support it,\u201d Dutton told reporters in Canberra.\n\nIn September, Lewis, who led ASIO for more than five years, warned that foreign interference presented a greater threat than terrorism.\n\nCanberra last year introduced tough new laws to curtail foreign agents after noting that China was trying to interfere in Australian affairs.\n\nAustralia now requires lobbyists for foreign countries to register and makes them criminally liable if they are deemed to be meddling in domestic affairs.\n\nThe legislation damaged bilateral ties with China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner. And the relationship has been especially strained in recent months after a spate of cyber-attacks blamed on China.\n\nReuters reported this month that Australian intelligence had determined China was responsible for a cyber-attack on the national parliament and three largest political parties before a general election in May, according to five people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry denied involvement in any hacking attacks and said the internet was full of theories that were hard to trace.", "description": "Australia's national intelligence agency said in a report published this week that it does not have enough resources to collect intelligence on potential foreign agents and their efforts to interfere in Canberra's affairs.", "authors": ["Colin Packham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
