The foul language; the visceral hatred; the unbearable tensions; the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives \u2013 it was like watching my first Saw movie.\n\nThey say sunshine is the best disinfectant, and outside in the bright autumnal afternoon I felt cleansed, and I put together some thoughts about why this superb fly-on-the-wall documentary works as well as it does.\n\nFor a start, the access secured by filmmaker Patrick Forbes was breathtaking, and the lack of restraint among the Tory parliamentarians quite stunning to behold. Discipline and morale has utterly collapsed. From January until a few weeks ago the penultimate dramas of Brexit are played out. For example, we witness the inside of a Eurosceptic European Research Group meeting, not so much foam flecked as more consumed by a sort of grim group paranoia, a body of men and women all determined to believe that \u201cthey\u201d \u2013 ie their fellow Conservatives running the party and the country \u2013 are lying to them, conspiring against them, sneakily betraying Brexit. It was disturbing to watch, and very otherworldly.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the ERG, responding to yet another Commons calamity for Theresa May, mumbled something about \u201c\u2018it\u2019 doesn\u2019t always mean what \u2018it\u2019 means\u201d, like a pin-striped Bill Clinton talking about oral sex.\n\nAlmost all the filming took place indoors and the claustrophobia, literal and metaphorical, was overpowering. The incidental music \u2013 lots of Bizet \u2013 added a vibrantly satirical touch to the dismal proceedings. Everything is dark, in all senses.\n\nThen there is the swearing. I\u2019ve met a few politicians in my time and noted how they, like journalists, have an inventive capacity for fruity language. But there is something especially entertaining in watching, on camera, these usually tightly controlled, professionally spun, careful individuals just letting fly with the F-word. \u201cWho the f*** do they think they are?\u201d asks Alan Duncan MP of his opponents. Anna Soubry doesn\u2019t wish to speak to her \u201cf***ing chief whip\u201d. My favourite was probably the moment when Nicholas Soames just declared \u201cwe are completely buggered\u201d, his bulk subsiding on his desk like the fall of an empire. The rest of the rude words cannot be reprinted on a family website.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The best TV shows of 2019 (so far) Show all 34 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he\u2019s stray cat that\u2019s just wandered in.\" Channel 4 17/34 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC) \"A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando\u2019s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can\u2019t really add anything to that.\" PA 18/34 Derry Girls (Channel 4) \"It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man\u2019s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.\" Peter Marley 19/34 Fleabag (BBC) \"While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O\u2019Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.\" BBC/Two Brothers/Luke Varley 20/34 Road to Brexit (BBC) \"The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it\u2019s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don\u2019t understand. Rather, it\u2019s a very clever, very funny, very 'different' parcel of bollocks to Brexit.\" BBC 21/34 Our Planet (Netflix) \"The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough\u2019s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can\u2019t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.\" Netflix 22/34 Line of Duty (BBC) \"Plausibility is a spectrum; Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the individual. The shadowy government forces are elected; the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It\u2019s exhausting work, policing the police.\" BBC 23/34 The Virtues \"Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham\u2019s abilities.

And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.' Amazon Prime 25/34 Years and Years \"Years and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.\" BBC 26/34 Killing Eve \"As the series develops, it\u2019s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle\u2019s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle\u2019s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-they/won\u2019t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.\" BBC/BBC America 27/34 Chernobyl \"Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.\" HBO 28/34 The Handmaid's Tale \"Season three's knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.\" Hulu 29/34 This Way Up \"The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.\" Channel 4 30/34 Jade: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain \"A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.\" Channel 4 31/34 Succession \"Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won\u2019t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.\" HBO 32/34 Kathy Burke\u2019s All Woman \"In Kathy Burke\u2019s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women \u2013 from nuns to reality stars \u2013 to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.\" Channel 4 33/34 The Capture \"So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.\" BBC/Heyday Films/Nick Wall 34/34 Top Boy \"Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.\" Netflix 1/34 Doctor Who - New Year's Day special (BBC1) \u201cAs a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who \u2013 i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks \u2013 this is a New Year treat that more than delivers\u201d BBC 2/34 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2) \u201cBilly Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity \u2013 a \u201cProustian wander through Scotland\u201d.

Remember that these are, or were, people supposed to be in the same political movement. Anna Soubry, who really did seem to be losing it a bit, warned us Boris Johnson is \u201cthe great charlatan\u201d, which is unarguable. Alan Duncan, the dapper Foreign Office minister once described as a \u201cbonsai Michael Heseltine\u201d, did a passable and contemptuous impression of Rees-Mogg\u2019s plummy accent, and wrote off Priti Patel as \u201ca complete and utter disgrace\u201d and \u201cthe worst international development secretary we have ever had\u201d.\n\nNicky Morgan even managed to self-parody herself when she abandoned all previous principles and positions, and chucked her lot in with Boris and no deal: \u201cI am intensely pragmatic\u201d. Yes, Nicky, that\u2019s one way of describing monumental self-betrayal.\n\nAndrew Bridgen, a Hobbit-like Eurosceptic who made his money out of potatoes, is apparently known to colleagues as \u201cSpud-U-Hate\u201d. He is perfectly open about plotting with Nigel Farage for some sort of electoral pact over drinks in some bar called Lou Lou\u2019s. Just in case you were wondering where Britain\u2019s economic future is being charted.\n\nAnd on and on it goes, and will go. We see Farage, filmed many months ago, as he \u201cprivately\u201d confides a prediction, one of the few accurate ones: \u201cWe are not leaving on 31 October... if Boris wins we ain\u2019t leaving.\u201d Farage was, in fact, by far the shrewdest operator we see in the whole sorry s**tshow: credit where it\u2019s due.\n\nAlan Duncan sums up the documentary, and the state of the Conservatives thus: \u201cThe sadness is you are mapping the day-to-day slow death of the most successful political party in democratic history.\u201d Sad, yes, and horrific, but utterly, gut-wrenchingly compelling.", "description": "After an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air\u00a0and go for a walk.
