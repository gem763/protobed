A 270-foot construction crane - one of two still looming over the multistory building - also was dangerously unstable, fire officials said.\n\nThe hunt for the missing was suspended at nightfall over safety concerns. A statement from the project contractor said its representatives would work 'throughout the night' with emergency officials on a plan to stabilize the building.\n\n'I heard a huge noise and thought it was a plane crashing,' said Sue Hurley, a 68-year-old guest at a hostel across the street that shuddered with the force of the collapse. Hurley said she was reminded of news accounts of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nVideo shows the moment that the top floors of the Hard Rock Cafe came crashing down onto Basin Street at around 9am in New Orleans that left one dead\n\nThis aerial photo shows the Hard Rock Hotel, which was under construction, after a fatal partial collapse in New Orleans\n\nThe building mostly fell on Basin Street, located just outside of the French Quarter\n\nDramatic bystander video of upper floors falling on top of each other before one side of the building crashed to the street was aired on WWL-TV.\n\nAnother video on social media showed what looked like a metal structure - part of the building or a piece of construction equipment - tumbling to the ground and people running from the scene as clouds of dust billowed up, obscuring the view like a thick fog.\n\n'I'm not sure what happened, but they told us to get out of here,' said Michael Arbeiter, 30, from Munich, Germany, a hostel guest who said he was just getting out of the shower when his room shook. 'Thank God it was not another 9/11.'\n\nOfficials said 18 people were taken to the hospital and several others went to the hospital on their own. They said none of their injuries was believed to be life threatening.\n\nUrban search and rescue teams entered a section of the building Saturday in hopes of finding two missing people alive, said Fire Chief Tim McConnell. Authorities later said one of the missing was dead.\n\nIt is not exactly known how the building collapsed. At least 20 people were injured and two are confirmed dead\n\nThe development was expected to be open in the spring. Debris can be seen falling off the building\n\nMeanwhile, authorities were keeping a wary eye on the unstable crane looming over the building.\n\n'There is a very strong possibility of further collapse of this crane right now,' McConnell said.\n\nCitadel Builders LLC, the contractor on the project, said more than 100 workers were on site at the time of the collapse. An email from spokesman Brian Trascher said company officials were working with emergency workers on a plan to stabilize the building.\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards visited the site and took part in news briefings soon after the collapse. The Democrat was defending his seat in a primary election Saturday that forced him into a runoff next month.\n\nThe new Hard Rock Hotel was under construction at the corner of Rampart Street and Canal Street, a broad boulevard just outside the Quarter that is lined with restaurants hotels and retailers.\n\nCanal, which carries six lanes of traffic divided by a wide median where streetcars roll, separates the Quarter from the city's main business district.\n\nConstruction workers were said to have had to climb down ladders in order to get to safety\n\nThree people are said to be missing from the scene\n\nAs search and rescue efforts unfolded, police stood sentry around a group of people on the Canal Street median believed to be loved ones of the missing. A woman nearby said she was trying to find out the status of her brother, a worker at the site. She declined to give her name, wiping tears from her eyes as she walked away.\n\nRemoval of the damaged crane and cleanup of massive piles of debris promised to be an enormous undertaking in the days ahead, expected to tie up traffic and commerce. Among area buildings evacuated was the Saenger Theatre, where traveling companies perform Broadway Shows regularly.\n\nHard Rock International issued a statement expressing sympathy for victims and their families. The statement said the company had a licensing agreement with the building's owner, Kailas Companies, and Hard Rock had no involvement in the construction. It identified the contractor on the project as Citadel Builders LLC.\n\nCitadel issued a statement expressing its condolences for the death and injuries but did not comment on a possible cause of the collapse.\n\nA public relations firm issued a statement on behalf of 1031 Canal, a corporate entity identified as the developer of the project that lists the Kailas Companies' Chandra Kailas as a principal. The statement said the developer would work with authorities and the contractor to determine what caused the collapse.\n\nA rescued construction worker makes his way down a ladder\n\nConstruction workers film the wreckage left behind after the building collapsed\n\nConstruction workers are helped by emergency personnel", "description": "At least two people are dead and 20 more are injured after a large portion of the Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans collapsed on Saturday morning near the city's historic French Quarter.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/06/19646766-0-image-a-26_1570945644947.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
