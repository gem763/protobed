For example, it would be possible to target men living in Swindon, aged 45-55, who are interested in football.\n\nIn 2018, Facebook launched an ad library to increase transparency around political advertising on the platform.\n\nImage copyright Facebook\n\nThe library can be searched to find all political ads being run by a specific Facebook page. For each ad, it's possible to check who paid for it and who has been shown the ad broken down by gender, age bracket and nation.\n\nThis information doesn't directly show which groups are being targeted by the advertiser but it's possible to infer the target gender or age group by analysing whether more men, women, older or younger people have been shown the ad.\n\nThe library also gives approximate figures for how many people have been shown the ad and how much the ad cost.\n\nIn addition to the adverts funded by the central Conservative Party, some local Conservative associations have paid for and published ads accusing opposition leaders of \"plotting\" against Brexit.\n\nThese are being shown to older Facebook users at least 88% of the time, and mostly to men.\n\nImage copyright Conservative Party\n\nConservative adverts aimed at people under 45 appear to focus less on Brexit and more on policing and mental health.\n\nThis difference in content reflects the division between older and younger voters on the issue of Brexit.\n\nIn 2018, Prof John Curtice analysed how people would vote in a second referendum.\n\n\"The UK is divided into the under-45s , who, on balance, favour staying in the EU, and the over-45s, who want to leave,\" he wrote.\n\nContent for under-45s also appears to be targeted by gender - men in this age bracket see more ads about policing than any other issue.\n\nImage copyright Conservative Party\n\nThese show Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressing the camera with an informal \"Hi folks\" and include messages about reducing crime and hiring more police officers.\n\nWomen under 45 make up over 90% of the audience for videos promising better mental health support for new mothers.\n\nImage copyright Conservative Party\n\nTheir style and tone is very different to the party's Brexit-focused ads.\n\nA Conservative Party official said: \"Political parties run ads to a range of different audiences, including policy-specific ones. Advert targeting will also be affected by who has engaged most with a specific advert.\"\n\nLiberal Democrats\n\nThough running far fewer adverts than the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats are also targeting Brexit messages towards specific age groups.\n\nIn direct contrast to the Conservative Party's, the Liberal Democrats' ads are about stopping Brexit and are mostly being seen by people under the age of 45.\n\nImage copyright Liberal Democrats\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are running 66 ads about Brexit, which have been seen between 2.2 million and 5.3 million times in total. The party's other 20 active adverts on Facebook are aimed at increasing party membership.\n\nLabour\n\nThe Labour Party is running fewer ads than the Conservatives, with 276 active adverts.\n\nBrexit is one of the issues covered by Labour but as part of a wider mix including fox hunting and the environment.\n\nThe audience for these adverts leans towards older people, with over 68% of the party's messaging on the environment and the economy aimed at over-45s.\n\nHowever, the age-specific targeting by the Labour Party does not appear to be as polarised as it is for the Conservatives. And there are no issues that appear to be primarily aimed at younger audiences.\n\nSome of Labour's ads do appear to be targeted by gender.\n\nAt least 73% of adverts against fox hunting are being shown to women. And over 60% of the audience party's ads about an upcoming general election are being shown to men.\n\nImage copyright Labour Party\n\nOther parties\n\nThe other political parties have been running very few adverts - and many have no advertising currently live on Facebook.\n\nWith only a few sporadic adverts available to analyse, it is hard to draw any conclusions about whether they yet have a strategy to target specific audiences on Facebook.\n\nHow we collect and analyse the data\n\nWe used Facebook's ad library to analyse all currently active political ads funded by the major UK parties. Information about major UK party campaigns correct as of 16 September.\n\nThis includes ads run by parties' main Facebook pages, party leaders' pages, and national party pages for Scotland and Wales.\n\nAds are only included in the library if they have been flagged by the advertiser as being about social issues, politics or elections.\n\nAll political parties in the UK would be expected to flag their paid content.", "description": "Political parties\u2019 Facebook ad campaigns are gearing up ahead of any election, BBC News research reveals.", "authors": ["Maryam Ahmed", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4283/production/_108872071_topfacebook976-nc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
