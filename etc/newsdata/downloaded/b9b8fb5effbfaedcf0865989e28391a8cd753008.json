They operate mainly online and use coded language and memes that might seem innocuous, but if you drill down into them they have meaning.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League is very keen to stress that more often that not, the symbol means everything is OK.\n\n\"The overwhelming usage of the hand gesture today is still its traditional purpose.\n\n\"As a result, someone who uses the symbol cannot be assumed to be using the symbol in either a trolling or white supremacist context.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "An anti-hate group says the finger-and-thumb sign is being used as an \"expression of white supremacy\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EF37/production/_108993216_ok-hand.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
