Facebook said earlier this month that it removed hundreds of accounts and pages for engaging in \u201cdomestic-focused coordinated inauthentic behavior\u201d in Iraq and Ukraine, and Twitter said last week that it banned accounts originating in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Spain, Ecuador and China in connection with conducting prohibited \u201cinformation operations.\u201d\n\nTwitter trailed Facebook as the second-most popular platform for governments to try to manipulate public opinion, according to the Oxford report. The researchers found evidence of propaganda campaigns from 47 countries occurring on Twitter, compared to 12 on YouTube, 12 on WhatsApp and eight on Instagram.\n\nIncluding all platforms, political parties or governments in 70 counties have used social media as a means to shape attitudes domestically since 2017, the report said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed smarter tools, greater transparency, and stronger partnerships to better identify emerging threats, stop bad actors, and reduce the spread of misinformation on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp,\u201d said a Facebook spokesperson. \u201cWe also know that this work is never finished and we can\u2019t do this alone. That\u2019s why we are working with policymakers, academics, and outside experts to make sure we continue to improve.\u201d\n\nReached for comment, YouTube pointed to the platform\u2019s previous investments in policies, resources and products devoted to tackling misinformation, including existing systems in place meant to prevent abuse.\n\n\u201cPlatform manipulation, including spam and other attempts to undermine the integrity of our service, is a clear violation of the Twitter Rules. We\u2019ve significantly stepped up our efforts \u2014 investing in people, policies, and tech \u2014 to catch this behavior at scale,\u201d said a YouTube spokesperson. \u201cResearch like this is the reason we\u2019ve made this important choice. We believe that full transparency empowers public understanding of these critical issues.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
