This vote will cause some agony for some members, but it will be up to each member\u2019s conscience,\u201d they said.\n\nAnother said: \u201cWe have stood with the DUP for so long that for some members, it will be painful to choose.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper reports that Peter Bone and Andrew Bridgen had suggested they were going to vote for it and Owen Paterson had not ruled it out, either. ERG chief Steve Baker and his deputy Mark Francois were said to have made \u2018positive noises\u2019 about it during the meeting and that they only had \u201climited remaining concerns\u201d.\n\nLeading Think Tanks Call for MPs to Reject \u2018Defective\u2019 Brexit Deal https://t.co/PkcSbtZPFu \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 18, 2019\n\nLabour MPs from Leave-backing constituencies may also feel compelled to back the deal. Jim Fitzpatrick, the Labour MP for Limehouse and Poplar, said he would vote for the deal, adding that up to 20 Labour MPs could back it, as well.\n\nITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston believes there is \u201cgenuinely a chance\u201d the bill could pass tomorrow. \u201cI never ever said that about any of Theresa May\u2019s Meaningful Votes,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Peston believes that 18 or 19 of the Tory Rebels \u2014 Remainers and soft-Brexiters who were expelled from the party for voting against the government \u2014 could back the deal. He believes that whilst the DUP remains a \u201cchallenge\u201d, \u201cthe ERG Spartans will fear if they vote against the deal and the WAB, that Brexit delay and no Brexit will follow\u201d. Earlier this week, leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said that \u201cthe votes are now there\u201d for Mr Johnson to pass an exit deal through parliament.\n\nFormer Prime Minister David Cameron \u2014 who legislated the referendum, campaigned for Remain, and resigned the day after citizens delivered a Leave result \u2014 said he would vote for the deal if he were still an MP. Comparing the current prime minister to a \u201cgreased piglet\u201d, he said he believed Mr Johnson\u2019s bill would pass on Saturday \u2014 but only just.\n\n\u201cThe thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people\u2019s hands where mere mortals fail,\u201d he said during a talk to promote his book For the Record.\n\n\u201cThe country voted to leave the European Union, the best way to leave is with a deal, I think a no-deal Brexit would be bad for the economy and bad for the union.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s much better to leave with a deal, and I think Boris has done well to achieve that deal. I hope he\u2019ll get it through parliament, I suspect he will but it will be tight,\u201d Mr Cameron said in comments reported by The Guardian.", "description": "Tory Brexiteers, dubbed \"the Spartans\", are reportedly split on whether to support Prime Minister Boris Johnson's proposed exit treaty.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/ERG-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
