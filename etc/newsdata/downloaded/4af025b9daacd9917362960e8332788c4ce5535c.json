Source: Supplied\n\nSo where did this start?\n\nThe story actually started nearly 30 years ago, when Kristine and Michael\u2019s son Jacob arrived.\n\nHe was diagnosed with severe autism at age two \u2013 with doctors telling the shocked parents that he would likely grow up unable to communicate.\n\nBut he quickly proved everyone very wrong, publishing his first academic paper published at 12.\n\nKristine ended up publishing a book about her son\u2019s life, entitled 'The Spark: A Mother\u2019s Story of Nurturing, Genius, and Autism' and gaining fame as an autism advocate.\n\nMeanwhile, Natalia was allegedly placed in an orphanage in Ukraine as a baby in 2003.\n\nFrom an early age, it became apparent that Natalia suffered from dwarfism - she was reportedly adopted by an American couple in 2008.\n\nKristine became known as an autism advocate.

You couldn't go to sleep. We had to hid all the sharp objects.\n\n\u201cI saw her putting chemicals, bleach, Windex something like that, in my coffee and I asked her, 'what are you doing?' she said, \u2018I am trying to poison you.\u2019\u201d\n\nNatalia is said to be an adult posing as a child. Image: Kristine Barnett\n\n\"She wasn't a child\"\n\nBut even more disturbingly, the couple now say that they also realised Natalia wasn\u2019t the six-year-old girl that she claimed to be.\n\nThey claim that Natalia had periods, full pubic hair and adult teeth.\n\nIn 2010, the parents claim that Natalia had a bone density test which reportedly revealed her to be at least 14.\n\nTwo years later, the Barnett\u2019s filed a motion with the Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis in the US to change Natalia\u2019s birth year.\n\nIt was changed from 2003 to 1989 \u2013 making Natalia 22 years old at the time.\n\nThe next year, the Barnett\u2019s rented an apartment in Lafayette in Indiana for Natalia before moving to Canada, believing that she was a legal adult.\n\nThey moved so that Jacob could study at a school in Ontario \u2013 it was at this point that Kristine claims they lost contact with Natalia.\n\nShe said she felt concerned that Natalia would pretend to be a child again and put another family in harm\u2019s way.\n\nKristine also claimed that Natalia was actually a woman that had periods. Image: Kristine Barnett\n\nOr was she?\n\nBut back in the US, another version of the truth was brewing \u2013 with a different bone density test finding that Natalia was only 11 years old in 2012.\n\nJust two years later, police apparently found out that Natalia had been left by her adoptive parents.\n\nShe told them that they had moved to Canada \u2013 with police apparently believing that Natalia was still a legal child at the time.\n\nIt\u2019s not known why it took the police until 2019 to bring charges of child abandonment against Michael and Kristine \u2013 but the couple were charged late last month.\n\nDuring the intervening years, another family, The Mans family of Indiana, applied to become Natalia\u2019s legal guardian.\n\nAlthough the family dropped their guardianship petition in 2018 \u2013Natalia had remained in their lives.\n\nNatalia reportedly hasn\u2019t had any contact with Michael and Kristine since 2013.\n\nWilliam and Kristine Barnett are now facing child abandonment charges.
