We'll send her off in style,' Ms Corbett said.\n\nLittle Penguins, also known as Fairy Penguins, are common on the southern Australian coast", "description": "Tula the Maremma sheepdog, along with her sister Eudy, have been guarding Middle Island - just off the Victorian coast near Warrnambool - since they were two-year-old puppies.", "authors": ["Brett Lackey For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/15/19926902-0-image-a-32_1571495861167.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
