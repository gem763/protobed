For just as long, federal agencies\u2019 adherence has been a giant disappointment. But that\u2019s beginning to change due to several unprecedented steps taken by President Trump. Take the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which will soon release updated estimates of the cost savings achieved from the administration\u2019s deregulatory efforts. This reporting hasn\u2019t received much attention, but it could usher in a new era of evidence-based federal policy.\n\nIn 1981, Ronald Reagan issued a pivotal presidential executive order requiring cost-benefit analysis for major regulations. This was supposed to force agencies to assess the inherent and inevitable economic tradeoffs associated with regulating, rather than basing policy on fanciful hopes and aspirations. Federal agencies instead developed a series of ad hoc reporting practices to justify their regulations. They called the reports they produced \u201ccost-benefit analysis,\u201d but they were little more than marketing gimmicks designed to justify preordained policy conclusions.\n\nOne would have expected academic economists, who are trained to assess such things, to cry foul. Instead, perhaps drawn by the allure of power and influence, many economists became little more than rubber stamps for the government\u2019s nonsensical practices. Reagan\u2019s executive order did little to introduce economics into regulators\u2019 decision making. It did create new constituencies of bureaucrats and academics who made entire careers off of lending a veneer of academic respectability to the government\u2019s analytical charade.\n\nNowhere is that charade more evident than in an annual report on regulations that OMB \u2014 until recently \u2014 issued. Year after year, the report made the unsubstantiated claim that federal regulations produce more benefits than costs. But it was only able to make this claim by ignoring one of the most central concepts in all of economics: the opportunity cost of capital.\n\nFor example, if a regulation produced environmental benefits that individuals psychologically valued at $1 million, but displaced $500,000 worth of capital investment, the OMB report would claim that the rule improves Americans\u2019 welfare. But a $500,000 investment \u2014 what society gives up to implement the regulation \u2014 can eventually grow into much more than $1 million. These returns could be used to finance any number of valuable social investments, including those that protect public health or the environment.\n\nSuch a regulation should fail a cost-benefit test over the long term, because it is inefficient, but these unseen future opportunity costs were ignored by OMB.\n\nTo his credit, President Trump\u2019s OMB has put a stop to these reports. While they did include some useful information, their primary effect was to mislead journalists and the public into thinking the federal regulatory system is an unambiguous success.\n\nTrump also issued an executive order in 2017 requiring that on balance, new regulations produce no net cost increase. This meant that if a new rule added to the monumental compliance costs Americans already face, a deregulatory effort would have to be initiated to offset the additional cost. While compliance from regulators hasn\u2019t been perfect, the policy represents a huge step forward because it redirects agency attention towards economic efficiency. Perhaps as a result, it is being followed up with meaningful reporting of greater analytical rigor than in the past.\n\nCritics argue that under the new approach, the benefits of regulation go overlooked, but they misunderstand economic theory. Costs and benefits are mirror images of one another. If a regulation (or a deregulatory action) produces more in financial benefits than costs, it saves money on balance. Any such policy should be allowed under a regulatory cost cap system.\n\nIn fact, the Trump administration\u2019s approach to measuring costs and benefits is more comprehensive than what\u2019s been done in the past. It is homing in on the largest, most long-lasting impacts of rulemaking: those affecting investment over time. Previous administrations focused on feel-good intentions while ignoring the broader economic ramifications of regulating.\n\nThe approach appears to be bearing fruit. Most recently, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that EPA achieved annualized cost savings of $21.5 million in fiscal year 2017 and $75.1 million in FY 2018. A new-and-improved annual report from OMB includes similar figures, estimating that executive branch agencies achieved cumulative net cost savings of $23 billion in FY 2018.\n\nThese incremental improvements in efficiency may seem small relative to the size of the economy, but through investment and reinvestment, they have the potential to generate far greater gains for society than the short-sighted fashionable issues-of-the-day agencies usually prioritize.\n\nOMB\u2019s FY 2019 cost savings estimates should be out soon. While not all regulations will be accounted for, this nonetheless constitutes major progress. Agencies like the EPA are taking other proactive steps. Its offices plan to issue self-binding regulations that will force the agency to commit to cost-benefit principles going forward. Together, the new OMB report and EPA OIG report offer a roadmap for how this cost-benefit balancing could look in the future.\n\nPresidents from Reagan to Obama made good intentions, not results, the centerpiece of their regulatory agendas. While the implementation of Trump\u2019s reforms has been challenging, his changes represent a major milestone in the advancement of evidence-based regulating. Rolling back the new cost caps and cost savings reporting would turn the country back to the regulatory dark ages that preceded this administration.\n\nThere remains much progress to be made, but one president has done more to champion the cost-benefit state than any other in recent memory. His name is Donald Trump.\n\nJames Broughel is a senior research fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.", "description": "For decades, presidential executive orders have required economic analysis to accompany federal regulations.
