It also called for citizens to \u201ccarry forward the spirit of Lei Feng\u201d, a former soldier who has been heavily used in party propaganda campaigns since the 1960s.\n\n\n\nCarl Minzner, China scholar and professor of law at Fordham Law School in New York, said, \u201cThe general goal of these guidelines is to define \u2018good\u2019 behaviour, and that includes everything from the ethical lessons you might want your children to internalise, from reading Peppa Pig stories to more political concepts of civic virtue \u2013 such as how citizens should think of their relationship with respect to their leaders.\u201d\n\nReleased on Sunday ahead of a major leadership meeting, the Fourth Plenum, taking place in Beijing, the guidelines underline Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s focus at the meeting \u2013 shoring up political legitimacy during a time when Beijing faces severe challenges, from protests in Hong Kong to a slowing economy and a long trade war with the US.\n\nHong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act passes first vote in the US\n\n\u201cUnder the background of profound changes in the international and domestic situation and profound changes in China\u2019s economic and social development \u2026 policies and regulations, and social governance are still not enough\u201d the document says in its introduction. \u201cThere are still many problems.\u201d\n\nMost important among the guidelines is for citizens to treat Xi Jinping Thought as the \u201ccore\u201d of their civic moral compass. In contrast to a previous version, first released in 2001, several references to other leaders in the country\u2019s history, from Mao Zedong to Deng Xiaoping have been omitted.\n\nExperts say the document is a sign that propaganda work will be ramped up, with a focus on the CCP version of Chinese traditions, and a focus on ethics and culture.\n\n\u201cWhile Beijing still adheres to the revolutionary Marxist faith, it is steadily pivoting back to its own past in search of an ideological basis to ground its rule and inspire its citizens,\u201d said Minzner.", "description": "The rules call for people to be honest and polite, as well as to defend the country's honour while abroad.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/chineseflagraising.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
