(Leah Hansen/CBC)\n\n\"All that marginal stuff has been replaced with brand new rock solid stuff, so our infrastructure is better today than it was before the tornadoes hit,\" said Conrad.\n\nThe City of Ottawa, meanwhile, has tallied its tornado costs at $3.8 million \u2014 which included launching an emergency operations centre that existed for weeks, and paying social services and recreational staff who helped residents affected by the tornadoes.\n\nNew radios for execs\n\nCity staff wrapped up their debriefs about last September's challenges long ago, but Di Monte's team is only now finishing a package of recommendations on how to address those challenges, particularly how to communicate when cell towers are out and phone batteries die.\n\nAt the time of the storm, city manager Steve Kanellakos admitted the city's top issue had been communication. He urged residents to get battery-powered radios.\n\nKanellakos described how even he could not get a signal and had to drive in his pyjamas until his phone had a few bars so he could talk with his senior team.\n\nThat would no longer happen today, Di Monte says.\n\nSenior city staff now carry portable radios that are on a dedicated, encrypted channel and can be reached in an emergency.\n\nThe city has also explored three manufacturers offering an umbrella or dome-like product often used by the military to set up communications in remote areas.\n\nHydro Ottawa CEO Bryce Conrad speaks as Mayor Jim Watson, emergency services manager Anthony Di Monte, and former police chief Charles Bordeleau listen, during a post-tornado press conference in September 2018.

Keith Egli said he's been reflecting on the trauma the tornado inflicted on his ward's neighbourhoods of Arlington Woods and Craig Henry.\n\n\"My community is still rebuilding, very much so. But there's just been such a renewed sense of community as a result of the tornado,\" he told CBC News this week.\n\nFor instance, a new community association has sprung up in Craig Henry.\n\nThe Trend-Arlington area also has a full day of events planned Saturday, including tree-planting in Bruce Pit and a sold-out dinner.\n\nThe community will also unveil a new entryway to its community building, built out of wood from trees that came down during the tornadoes.", "description": "One year after tornadoes ripped through the\u00a0Dunrobin, Merivale and Greenboro\u00a0neighbourhoods, the City of Ottawa is only now summing up its\u00a0lessons learned.", "authors": ["Kate Porter Covers Municipal Affairs For Cbc Ottawa.
