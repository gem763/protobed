Such games can become fascinating to football geeks and countercultural sorts seeking variety in this century full of 45-38s and the like.\n\nAD\n\nThe connoisseur might revel in good, barren, throwback scraps, and in 2019, the Big Ten has become the place to hunt for those.\n\nAD\n\nWhile offense dominates national chitchat \u2014 and look at that LSU passing game! \u2014 the Big Ten has four of the top five teams nationally in total defense and four of the top seven in yards-per-play defense. No. 6 Wisconsin (6-0) stands atop both lists among its pile of absurd numbers, which includes four shutouts and then this monster stat: four touchdowns scored by its defense, four touchdowns \u00adallowed by its defense.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got some smart, tough, dependable people on this defense,\u201d safety Eric Burrell told Wisconsin reporters last week after the Badgers became the first major college team since 1967 to log four shutouts in its first six games. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of no-name guys on this team that people don\u2019t know about till they actually play them, and then after the game they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, damn.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe spoke brightly and chirpily in a country in which defenses have become generally sad, where it\u2019s possible to feel sympathy for sturdy defenders, where all of us extol an Oklahoma defense that winds up allowing Texas only 27 points.\n\nAD\n\nOh, damn: The top five total defenses include No. 1 Wisconsin (173.7 yards allowed per game), No. 2 Ohio State (234), No. 4 Penn State (259.7) and No. 5 Iowa (260.8). The Big Ten was gracious enough to let defending national champion Clemson slip in there at No. 3. In yards per play, it\u2019s No. 1 Wisconsin (3.06), No. 2 Ohio State (3.69), No. 3 Penn State (3.83) and No. 7 Michigan (4.2), not to mention No. 15 Indiana (4.51), No. 16 Iowa (4.58) and No. 23 Michigan State (4.74), which sits one notch ahead of that long-standing fashion, \u00adAlabama.\n\nThe past three games between Michigan and Penn State have wound up with final scores of 42-7, 42-13 and 49-10, with the 2013 game at 43-40 and the 2010 game at 41-31. Yet it looks as if their meeting Saturday night in State College, Pa., the nation\u2019s choicest matchup this week, could satisfy those who love variety and love a good 14-10 here or there (and maybe even a long-sought 11-10).\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs the game goes on, you definitely start to see the offensive line, you know, wearing down,\u201d Penn State defensive tackle PJ Mustipher said at a news conference this week. It has been a Big Ten season rich in \u00adwearings-down.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s an uptick from 2018, when the total-defense rankings ended with Michigan at No. 2, Iowa at No. 7, Michigan State at No. 10, Wisconsin at No. 29 and Penn State at No. 34, with the yards-per-play category holding Michigan State at No. 5, Iowa at No. 7 and Michigan at No. 8. It\u2019s also something of a tricky suss in one sense: Those seven Big Ten teams in the top 23 in yards-per-play defense have combined to play just three Power Five teams in nonconference games. Michigan State lost a 10-7 scrap for morsels to Arizona State; Iowa won an 18-17 backyard fistfight with Iowa State; and Northwestern, whose defense is not its problem, lost a 17-7 opener at Stanford, whose defense is seldom its problem.\n\n\u201cIn this game, doesn\u2019t matter what position, anytime you can make someone uncomfortable, that\u2019s another stress, right?\u201d Wisconsin Coach Paul Chryst said at his news conference this week, referring to stressing out quarterbacks and other beings. \u201cAnd I think the good players learn how to play through that, and the old adage, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be comfortable being uncomfortable,\u2019 there\u2019s some truth to that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBig Ten defenses seem to have caught offenses in the learning stage of being comfortable being uncomfortable, with the utmost discomfort occurring in that gem of a town, Madison.\n\nAD\n\nThere, the Wisconsin defense reveled in a late interception last week by one of the best names in college football, Rachad Wildgoose, which kept Michigan State\u2019s score at a telltale zero in a 38-0 finish, three weeks after Wisconsin saw its 35-0 lead on Michigan reduced so unthinkably to 35-14 by the end.\n\n\u201cI feel like [the shutout] just shows everybody how dominant our defense is,\u201d linebacker Chris Orr told reporters after that, saying of the zero, \u201cWe take pride in that for sure.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a land of odd slogans, the Badgers have the motto, \u201cno switch,\u201d which means they aim to refrain from being one of those off-and-on defenses, and in the ultimate vanguard compliment, Orr called the unit \u201c11 dogs on the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do a good job in terms of giving you different looks; they have good players coming off the edge and overwhelm you with some different types of blitzes,\u201d Michigan State Coach Mark \u00adDantonio said.\n\nAD\n\nMichigan\u2019s 10-3 win over Iowa, two weeks after its dire inconveniences at Wisconsin, seemed to restore the concept of Michigan as a merciless defender. The Wolverines outgained the Hawkeyes 267-261, totals that constitute a good half in some leagues. Michigan Coach Jim Harbaugh called it \u201ca defensive masterpiece,\u201d and Michigan needed it after Ohio State seemed to alter Michigan\u2019s idea of itself last \u00adNovember by a 62-39 score.\n\nAD\n\nMichigan then permitted only 256 yards last Saturday to Illinois, the team that welcomes Wisconsin this week. It set up the possibility of a Michigan-Penn State match ruled by defenses, with a weather forecast suggesting temperatures may hover in the high 40s during the game. Ahead of kickoff, it all sounds quite Big Ten-ish, not to \u00admention novel.\n\nRead more on college sports:\n\nAD", "description": "Led by Wisconsin, it has been difficult for anyone in the conference to make its points.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/V2fZpbn9C8RIrp6kQTbLGgtLfSs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7HS3BHXR34I6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
