But the state is home to a graveyard full of big project plans whose biggest headstones are owned by big corporations local and foreign and whose binding trait was supposed to be systemic risk management and fiscal caution.\n\nOn a railroad to nowhere\n\nOf the three greenfields mine-to-port developments, Oakajee always seemed to me to be the least likely to happen \u2013 if only because the resources targeted for development never seemed to hold hope of producing at the scale that might justify the capital cost of a 570-kilometre railway and port.\n\nMind you, there was a banquet of other reasons too, the most obvious being the problematic fact that through the most active phases of its state government-powered progress maybe a decade ago, the Mid West was so broadly owned by competitors public, private and state-owned \u2013 and competition invariably makes alignment around infrastructure development a Sisyphean task.\n\nThere have been at least three drawn-out plans to introduce coastal WA to a new iron ore mining export hub over the past decade. Two have been still-born and a third \u2013 the Balla Balla project presently supported by one of New Zealand\u2019s richest families \u2013 is well on the way to making that a threepeat.\n\nWork on the Oakajee project stopped in 2013 after depressed iron ore prices brought iron ore mining in the Mid West to a halt. And last week\u2019s transaction announced what we knew well before that: Mitsubishi had blown about $500 million and Sinosteel likely something similar on what, in the harsh light of day, were projects that were never going to stack up.\n\nNot more than a year after Oakajee hit the wall, Boasteel and Queensland\u2019s kings of the coal trains, Aurizon, ponied up $1.4 billion for Aquila Resources. It owned long-dated plans for an integrated mine-rail-port development that would open the West Pilbara to mining and result in a new port being built at Ankattell just south of Rio Tinto\u2019s Cape Lambert facility.\n\nThat never happened. Aurizon\u2019s share of the Aquila transaction came to $210 million. It ended up taking impairments of $251 million on the deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaying the price\n\nBHP\u2019s decision to go 100 per cent renewable to meet the power requirements of its Chilean mines means that since July our national resources champion has committed $1.18 billion to dealing with the climate challenge owned by its global operations and those of its customers.\n\nMonday\u2019s confirmation of the renewables promise hinted at during last week\u2019s annual general meeting in London landed with a bit of a sting. The need to account for cancelled contracts of fossil-fuel generated electricity will see BHP take a provision of $US780 million when it reports its first half results next February.\n\nBHP has two copper hubs in Chile and the biggest by far is Escondida.\n\nPower has recently become big business at Escondida. It accounts for a staggering 20 per cent of the copper complex\u2019s costs, which means it costs about $US1 billion to keep the lights and so much more on.\n\nThe reason electricity matters so much is that the copper monster\u2019s three processors will soon rely 100 per cent on desalinated water. To make that happen the miners have to force 4000 litres a second of newly fresh water from a desal plant at sea level through a pipeline to a mine that sits 3000m above sea level in an Andean desert.\n\nThe one-off hit to the P &L will be taken on contracts that will be unwound over a decade. That, to my mind, is indicative of the breadth of change that sits at the heart of BHP\u2019s decision making. And there is evidence enough to suggest this changed approach to energy supply, which will reduce BHP\u2019s scope II emissions footprint in Chile to zero, is likely to prove a template in the miner\u2019s other major constituencies.\n\nBHP Copper\u2019s material investment in emissions reduction was revealed just four months after chief executive Andrew Mackenzie announced plans to invest $US400 million over five years on schemes aimed at containing the climate toll that is released when BHP\u2019s customers transform the raw materials the company extracts and sells.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, to the manifest frustration of BHP\u2019s board and management, the reward for those emissions initiatives and so many more is that next week BHP will be drawn back into a rolling maul with an increasingly sophisticated climate lobby that is determined to undermine the public standing and financial muscle of the Minerals Council of Australia.\n\nThe London AGM saw shareholders in control of 22 per cent of BHP\u2019s UK listing vote in favour of a resolution that would end the company\u2019s membership of lobbies that are either politically active or fail tests of climate advocacy.\n\nThe resolution in question was presented for consideration at the Limited meeting on November 7 by the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR). It was presented to the UK meeting because that is what you have to do when you run a dual-listed structure.\n\nThe strength of the UK vote was the product of effective lobbying by the Church of England and the growing public sensitivity to climate of big investors such as Legal & General and Aberdeen Standard.\n\nThe force of that vote is unlikely to be repeated in Australia, mostly because it will take an unlikely constitutional reform to allow the vote to actually occur.\n\nBHP to stick with the MCA\n\nAs we have noted in the past, the MCA relies on the increasingly climate-conscious BHP and Rio Tinto for about 60 per cent of its funding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week\u2019s AGM bought broad but strong assertion from BHP of the value of its extant industry associations. The intent of that commentary was plain.\n\nWhile BHP is again actively reviewing its slate of memberships, there will be no retreat from the MCA or any of the other associations that passed muster first time round. Neither, just as importantly, will there be a move, public or private, to promote reformation of the council.\n\nThere are two logical pegs to a decision that pretty much means BHP will continue to follow its own path through the political theatre and physical realities of emissions, energy and climate.\n\nFirst, recent experience has demonstrated there is absolutely nothing practical to be gained by making concessions to the activists bent on neutering the MCA and its sometimes excessively exuberant associate, Coal21.\n\nThe second, for mine, is that another tilt by BHP at the MCA (remember, BHP has form there) would likely trigger aggressive response from a federal government whose electorally inspired affection for the coal has been made as consistently plain as its rare capacity for vengefulness.", "description": "The lure of very big iron ore projects in Western Australia has proved costly for Japan, China and Australia Inc alike.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3531%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_39/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4830999acc12a70699877bec2209763c0ceb5790", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
