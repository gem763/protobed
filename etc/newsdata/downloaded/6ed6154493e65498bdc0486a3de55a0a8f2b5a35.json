When Speaker Pelosi essentially accuses Trump of being a Russian stooge and someone like Rooney responds by saying, \u201cShe\u2019s got a point,\u201d it feels like there\u2019s a level of growing Republican frustration with Trump that will eventually find an outlet. Just seems like under any normal conditions, any GOP lawmaker would dismiss such a suggestion as absurd and offensive.\n\nMelanie: We\u2019ve seen some Republicans start to dip their toes in the impeachment waters \u2014 but no-one has jumped in just yet. Sen. Lisa Murkowksi (R-Alaska), who has been pretty careful with her responses to the Ukraine scandal, said: \u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative \u2014 period.\u201d And as Nancy and Josh mentioned, Rooney, who has been sitting in on the closed-door depositions, said he was stunned by Mulvaney\u2019s admission of a quid pro quo and hasn\u2019t ruled out supporting impeachment. \u201cI want to get the facts and do the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I\u2019ll be looking at my children a lot longer than I\u2019m looking at anybody in this building.\u201d\n\nDoes the White House seem closer or farther away from an actual impeachment strategy?\n\nDarren: Things are going about how you\u2019d expect they would for the Trump White House. There are too many conflicting messages coming out, and we have different power centers caught up in the scandal trying to save themselves. Chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s press conference this week, where he acknowledged the political reality of withholding military assistance to Ukraine, followed a pattern we saw during the Mueller and Stormy Daniels probes where Rudy Giuliani would blurt out damaging things that had been done but insist they were all perfectly appropriate. I can\u2019t really tell what the point is other than to limit the damage among Republicans who have to be taking everything in and wondering which way the wind will be blowing when it does come time to vote on impeachment.\n\nNatasha: Farther away, especially as Trump\u2019s allies, particularly in Congress, work for days to try to deny that something happened \u2014 i.e., a quid pro quo \u2014 only to have someone from the White House or Trump himself completely undermine it in a press conference or tweet, as we saw on Thursday with Mulvaney. The closest thing to a strategy that emerged this week was a concerted attack on Nancy Pelosi, which seemed to have backfired as Pelosi proudly displayed a photo of herself standing up to Trump as her Twitter banner.\n\nNancy: Strategy has never the strong suit of this particular White House. We\u2019re seeing the same pattern play out with impeachment, as everyone in the Trump orbit from lawyers to outside allies to top West Wing staffers vie for the opportunity to impress the president.\n\nJosh: Still seems more like improvisation than strategy to me. Whatever they\u2019re trying to do is poorly calibrated, even if there is a plan. I thought it was interesting that Mulvaney talked about the importance of having \u201cour P.R. people\u201d at the table, even as he made a confusing presentation that was entirely unhelpful to the president. There does seem to be some fairly consistent messaging about the process, but I suspect this may be because surrogates are too worried about being contradicted on the facts to attempt to defend Trump on those grounds.\n\nMelanie: It still looks like the Trump campaign is taking the lead on the president\u2019s impeachment defense strategy \u2014 and it\u2019s not always consistent with the White House, which is creating some headaches for the GOP. Case in point: Even after Mulvaney walked back his admission of a quid pro quo (and Republicans sought to distance themselves from the comments), the Trump campaign embraced one of his lines from the press conference \u2014 \u201cget over it\u201d \u2014 and turned it into a T-shirt.\n\nDo you think we will be seeing more or less of Rudy?\n\nDarren: I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m writing this, but I think there will be less Rudy going forward. By all accounts, federal prosecutors from the office in New York that he once led are giving Giuliani and his business dealings in Ukraine a thorough scrubbing. And Giuliani knows better than anyone what he\u2019s saying aloud on television and in print interviews can end up being used against him in an indictment. So, I expect Rudy to stop doing so many interviews but that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t still be working closely with the president to strategize on impeachment, 2020 politics and probably some policy, too. And of course, this being Rudy, I completely expect to eat everything I just wrote when he does a full Ginsburg on the Sunday shows.\n\nNatasha: Most experts believe it would be wise for Giuliani to lay low as federal prosecutors examine whether he violated any foreign agent registration laws or engaged in any financial improprieties related to his foreign clients, and indeed he\u2019s been less visible on cable news in the last week and seemingly harder to reach than in the past. But he also just lost his lawyer, Jon Sale, who he\u2019d been leaning on to deal with congressional subpoenas and documents requests. So it\u2019s possible Giuliani will re-emerge to defend himself publicly without a lawyer around advising him not to.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e4/e8/d060c5564d61be2e5e15ec6d1470/191018-mulvaney-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
