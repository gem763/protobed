We are on a flight path here but you never expect something like this to happen.\n\n\"It's a miracle that it landed in the garden on not on me in the house. I'm very lucky in that regard.\"\n\nAviation experts attended the scene and confirmed the debris was part of a giant B-52 bomber which had been based in the county at RAF Fairford, Glos.\n\nWarwickshire Police shared the details of the shocking incident on social media with a picture of the yellow metal casing from the US Air Force war plane.\n\nPCSO Emma Turner and PCSO Fin Moore, from Shipston Police Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: \"Yesterday around 5.30pm in Brailes a resident reported hearing a thud in her front garden on closer inspection she discovered what appeared to be a small part from an aircraft.\n\n\"We attended and Aviation and relevant Authorities were informed. (Thankfully no harm to persons/animals/property)\n\n\"Its a part from a US B52 Bomber from Fairford Glos. They have been in contact.\"\n\nIt is unclear which part of the plane it has come from, but it believed it could be part of the engine cowling, which covers and cools the engine during take-off and landing.\n\nWeb users reacted to the bizarre incident on social media and said it was a miracle nobody was hurt and no property was damaged.\n\nIan Bright said: \"Considering what could have fallen off a B52, think they got away lightly.\"\n\nMel Harris added: \"That is extremely dangerous. Its a miracle nobody was badly hurt or killed and so lucky it missed all the houses.\"\n\nRAF Fairford is a temporary military base for the B-52s, which were used by the USAF Air Force since 1955 and featured in the Cold War, Vietnam War and the Gulf War.\n\nThey are part of a deployment of four from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, a southeastern U.S. state on the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThey have been in Britain for the past few weeks as part of Bomber Task Force Europe, an American show of military strength and support in Europe.\n\nWhen they arrived in March it was the largest US bomber deployment to the UK since the Iraq war.\n\nThe Boeing B-52 is one of the largest war planes used by the USAF, it carries up to 70,000 pounds of weapons and cost around $14million each.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nEach plane can carry up to 70,000 lbs of weapons and has a combat range of around 8,800 miles without refuelling.\n\nThe USAF said the deployment of strategic bombers to the UK helps establish and develop RAF Fairford as their forward operating location for bombers.\n\nA statement said: \"Training with joint partners, allied nations and other U.S. Air Force units contributes to a lethal and ready force and enables us to build enduring and strategic relationships necessary to confront a broad range of global challenges.\n\n\"These Airmen will also train in a joint environment with partner and allied counterparts during the deployment \u2014 an opportunity that will greatly enhance global stability and security while enabling units to become familiar with operations in different regions.\"", "description": "A large metal chunk from an American B-52 bomber landed in the property's garden in Brailes, Warwickshire", "authors": ["Ed Chatterton", "Image", "Swns", "Warwickshire Police"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20750865.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_B52_BOMBER_001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
