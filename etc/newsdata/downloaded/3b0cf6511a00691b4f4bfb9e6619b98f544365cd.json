That\u2019s 1am BST on 23 September in the UK, where it won\u2019t be available to watch unless you purchase a VPN.\n\nThe evening will be broadcast live on Fox in the US, but The Independent\u2019s Culture team will be live-blogging the night on our site.\n\nAs ever, E! Online will be covering the red carpet arrivals, which UK audiences will be available to watch on TV as well as YouTube\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6013555446001\n\nKilling Eve Season 2: Official trailer\n\nWhat do we know about the ceremony?\n\nNot a huge amount is known about the event, but \u2013 in the same vein as the Oscars \u2013 it\u2019ll be presenter-less for the fourth time in history.\n\nInstead, a voiceover will offer a \u201crefreshing, lighthearted take on the traditional factoids that audiences typically learn as winners make their way to the podium mixed with jokes, commentary and unexpected anecdotes\u201d.\n\nSomething else that will be absent from proceedings is a live orchestra. This means that Halsey will perform during the \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d montage, while Adam Devine will introduced the Variety categories.\n\nWho will hand out the trophies?\n\nThe full list of guest presenters has now been announced. Tim Allen, James Corden, Kerry Washington, Regina King, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Bill Hader, Ben Stiller, Catherine O\u2019Hara and Marisa Tomei will be handing out the statuettes.\n\nAlso presenting will be the winners of last week\u2019s Emmys for guest roles in TV shows, Cherry Jones, Jane Lynch, Luke Kirby and Bradley Whitford.\n\nThere\u2019ll also be a Game of Thrones reunion on stage. Stars expected to attend include Alfie Allen, Gwendoline Christie, Emilia Clarke, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington, Lena Headey, Sophie Turner, Carice van Houten and Maisie Williams.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich TV shows have been nominated for the top prizes?\n\nGame of Thrones picked up a historic 32 nominations this year, winning a heap at last week\u2019s Creative Arts Emmys ceremony. It looks set to win even more tonight despite the eighth and final season proving divisive among fans. Could Better Call Saul, Pose or Succession pip it to the post? It seems very unlikely at this stage.\n\nAnother show nominated for its final season is Veep. The Emmys have made a habit of awarding shows for their final seasons, so expect awards galore for the Julia Louis-Dreyfus comedy series.\n\nIn terms of Limited Series, Chernobyl is the one to beat, but it\u2019ll face stiff competition in the form of Netflix\u2019s When They See Us and Fosse/Verdon, which looks set to pick up a trophy for Michelle Williams.\n\nThe acting awards are less certain. While voters could opt for the popular nominees \u2013 GoT stars Clarke and Harington \u2013 it does seem like an underdog could reign supreme. Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul) and Jodie Comer (Killing Eve) would both receive one hell of a cheer should either of them win.\n\nSaying this, it would be great to see Headey, Coster-Waldau and van Houten get recognised for their supporting work in Game of Thrones.\n\nThen there\u2019s Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Sian Clifford who could very well make UK headlines with several wins for Fleabag.\n\nYou can find the full nominations list below:\n\nLead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie:\n\nMahershala Ali, True Detective\n\nBenicio Del Toro, Escape at Dannemora\n\nHugh Grant, A Very English Scandal\n\nJared Harris, Chernobyl\n\nJharrel Jerome, When They See Us\n\nSam Rockwell, Fosse / Verdon\u200b\n\nLead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie:\n\nAmy Adams, Sharp Objects\n\nPatricia Arquette, Escape at Dannemora\n\nAunjanue Ellis, When They See Us\n\nJoey King, The Act\n\nNiecy Nash, When They See Us\n\nMichelle Williams, Fosse / Verdon\n\nLead Actor in a Comedy Series:\n\nDon Cheadle, Black Monday\n\nMichael Douglas, The Kominsky Method\n\nBill Hader, Barry\n\nEugene Levy, Schitt's Creek\n\nAnthony Anderson, black-ish\n\nTed Danson, The Good Place\n\nLead Actress in a Comedy Series:\n\nChristina Applegate, Dead To Me\n\nRachel Brosnahan, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel", "description": "Speculation is rife as to who will walk away with the top prizes at the Emmys tonight.The award ceremony never fails to provide talking points and tonight\u2019s event looks to be no different.", "authors": ["Jacob Stolworthy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ErgnwZv1_9fvoZFn0XRJUQ--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a7a5e44a57051ef18d79e9c40d5508a7", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
