General Assembly Trump threatens to overshadow U.N. climate push Here\u2019s what to watch at Monday\u2019s summit as governments, businesses and activists seek to move past a no-show United States.\n\nThe politics of climate change claim the main U.N. stage Monday in New York with appeals from world leaders (and notable absences) and some new proposals to tackle greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nSo who and what are worth watching?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAt this one-day climate summit that kicks off the annual U.N. General Assembly, the star attractions are Boris Johnson, Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Narendra Modi, joined by leaders of 60 countries and dozens of multinationals. Donald Trump will skip it \u2014 as will the Japanese and Australian prime ministers and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe host, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, says he \u201ctold leaders not to come with fancy speeches, but with concrete commitments\u201d that go beyond the 2015 Paris climate pact.\n\n\n\nWhat's the context here?\n\nNo one \u2014 neither the European nor Asian governments that are here, nor the U.S. that isn\u2019t \u2014 is cutting emissions fast enough to address many scientists\u2019 warnings of looming catastrophe in the coming decades. China\u2019s are still rising rapidly.\n\nMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Even before they started, the summit and its 10 days of related official events helped drive a global conversation about climate. Individual countries are expected to announce plans to exceed the nonbinding pledges they made in Paris. Big companies are offering ideas, too. Nestl\u00e9 is one of the latest to commit to a 2050 target to get to zero carbon emissions, while IKEA, Salesforce and L\u2019Oreal are among the companies making pledges to align with the Paris deal. Big banks and insurers backing climate finance include Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Japan\u2019s Government Pension Investment Fund.\n\nThese moves are driven by undeniably growing public anxiety. Recent scientific studies say nations may have as little as 12 years to cut their greenhouse gas emissions sharply enough to allow human civilization to avoid serious harm from rising seas, spreading illness, worsening storms and other effects of a warming planet. More bad news is expected Wednesday when the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports on oceans, following up on its negative assessment on land use in August. Public opinion is spurring politicians and companies to act \u2014 or at least look like they\u2019re acting. Ahead of her arrival in New York, Germany\u2019s Merkel on Friday announced a new \u20ac50 billion plan.\n\n\n\nBut without the U.S. on board, isn\u2019t any climate push hobbled from the start?\n\nYes and no.\n\nBy announcing his decision to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate pact ratified by 185 nations, Trump slowed the diplomatic and policy momentum behind a coordinated global response. At home, citing his claims of harm to the economy, the U.S. president rolled back the Obama administration\u2019s regulations on greenhouse gas limits for cars, trucks and power plants, and pushed the U.S. to burn a lot more coal. He\u2019s the spoiler at the global climate bash in New York this week.\n\nEven so, Trump may be the most important but, he isn\u2019t the only player able to drive the climate policy agenda in the United States. Hundreds of mayors, more than a dozen states and the biggest American philanthropists \u2014 including former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and most recently Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos \u2014 are throwing their weight behind activist laws, pollution targets and investments. They hope to have an impact beyond the Trump presidency. Companies that operate globally are embracing renewables for business reasons.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201908/2949/1155968404_6077354855001_6077358172001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nBut here\u2019s a reality check: For all their sincerity \u2014 or, depending where you fall politically, sanctimony \u2014 there\u2019s only so much that business or local leaders can do without the backing of the U.S. government.\n\nDon\u2019t expect any change in policy soon. Trump\u2019s climate politics enjoy significant Republican support. Twenty-two GOP senators urged him to leave the Paris accord in May 2017. You do hear some dissenting voices in the party, however. \u201cI wish America were in a leadership position, not watching others from the side,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), then-President Barack Obama\u2019s opponent in the 2012 election, tells POLITICO. He adds: \u201cIt reduces the prospect of us being a leader in the world.\u201d\n\nEuropean allies lament the United States' absence. \"It really makes the fight against climate change much more difficult and complex,\" says European Commission Vice President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d. \"What we have to do here is live by example and to develop the economic narrative that to go green it pays off.\"\n\n\n\nBut what are the practical implications of the U.S. approach?\n\nFor one thing, there\u2019s a lot less money for the Green Climate Fund, a U.N.-created pot meant to help developing nations adapt to climate change. Obama had promised to pay $3 billion into the fund by 2020; Trump has made no contributions to it.\n\nSome worry the U.S. could lose out financially. A 2016 study from the International Finance Corp. estimated the world will see about $23 trillion in potential climate-related investments in developing countries through 2030. Now, those opportunities may go to China and other countries aggressively pursuing them.\n\nSome politicians in the EU threatened to refuse to engage in trade talks with the U.S. if Trump follows through with his pledge to formally exit the Paris deal next year.\n\n\n\nBut isn\u2019t the focus on the U.S. misplaced? China is the biggest greenhouse gas polluter now, and regardless of the political optics, the U.S. has done as well as any major developed economy to reduce emissions.\n\nTrue, China became the largest producer of carbon dioxide in 2006, passing the United States. The Chinese counter that America has done far more damage to the atmosphere during its long reign as an industrial power \u2014 about twice as many tons of carbon pollution, according to the historical data. Be that as it may, as China works to catch up economically, Beijing is only promising to peak its carbon output no later than 2030. By then, according to current estimates, its emissions will be 33 to 47 percent above what they were in 2010.\n\nThe U.S. record on reductions certainly isn\u2019t anything that climate activists swoon over. Despite an overall downward trend during the past 12 years, the U.S. is nowhere near meeting Obama\u2019s climate targets: The country\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions are 10.4 percent below 2005 levels, making it practically impossible to achieve the Obama administration\u2019s goal of a 17 percent cut by 2020 and 26-28 percent by 2025. The Climate Action Tracker shows that U.S. emissions will probably get only halfway to the Obama goal.\n\n\n\nSurely then the Europeans, who are all on board behind Paris, are leading the way on government-mandated emissions reduction?\n\nWell, sorta. Europe is meeting its emissions goals. That\u2019s in large part because the EU has since the 1970s had stagnant population and relatively slow economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is [the goals] weren\u2019t tough enough,\u201d says Mauro Petriccione, the EU\u2019s top climate bureaucrat. And the bloc isn\u2019t coming to Monday\u2019s summit with any pledges of further reductions.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the European Commission president-elect, doesn\u2019t have the power to commit the Union to anything new before Nov. 1, and will need the support of EU national leaders and the European Parliament to make any pledges. But her intentions are clear, says Petriccione: cut emissions by up to half by 2030.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2144/1155968404_6088166441001_6088168345001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nFor this week, rather than focus on additional emissions cuts, Petriccione insists, it\u2019s more important for the EU to \u201ccreate a viable model for a modern clean economy\u201d that countries including China, India and the U.S. can eventually copy, because the rest of the world outside Europe is responsible for more than 90 percent of global emissions.\n\n\n\nSo what does business want from the pols on climate?\n\nMainly, predictability. Many companies are moving in a greener direction, but that\u2019s a long-term commitment of resources and business strategy. \u201cMarkets need full information on climate risks and opportunities,\u201d says Jen Austin of the We Mean Business coalition, along with \u201cclear pricing signals,\u201d a term that can include the kind of carbon tax or fee that for now is off the table politically in the United States.\n\nBut business leaders aren\u2019t immune to spinning on climate and not backing it up with action. Of 45 economic sectors assessed by the International Energy Agency, only seven are on track to live up to the Paris agreement\u2019s goals. Those not on track include the electric power, fuel supply and building sectors.\n\n\n\nTo close up here, what are the odds anyone will remember this summit a year from now?\n\nFifty-fifty. If China comes to the carbon pricing party this week in New York, that would be a real political turning point. Don\u2019t hold your breath, since Xi is missing from the action. This week is more likely to be remembered as the week that banks, other companies and teenagers took charge of the multilateral climate response \u2014 in the absence of united political action \u2014 egged on by Europe and small nations.\n\nKalina Oroschakoff, Matt Daily and Bob King contributed to this report.", "description": "Here's what to watch at Monday's summit as governments, businesses and activists seek to move past a no-show United States.", "authors": ["Anthony Adragna", "Helena Bottemiller Evich"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/04/f8/2f192d854549a2d993bf3f1982f1/20190922-un-hq-ny-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
