Rashida Tlaib\u2019s \u201cracist\u201d assertion this week that facial recognition analysts \u201cneed to be African-Americans, not people that are not.\u201d\n\nThe Michigan Democrat made the comment on Monday while visiting the city\u2019s \u201cReal Time Crime Center.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnalysts need to be African-Americans, not people that are not, because let me tell you \u2014 no, it happens all the time, it\u2019s true,\u201d she said while flanked by a reporter from The Detroit News. \u201cI think non-African-Americans think all African-Americans look the same.\u201d\n\nMr. Craig, who himself is African-American, attempted to tell the congresswoman, to no avail, that trained professionals of any race or ethnicity are perfectly capable of doing their job.\n\n\u201cBut it does make a huge difference,\u201d she countered after the police chief\u2019s correction.\n\n\u201cIf I had made a similar comment, people would be outraged. They\u2019d be calling for my resignation,\u201d Mr. Craig told a local ABC affiliate on Wednesday. \u201cI think they\u2019re racist.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a software. It\u2019s biometrics,\u201d he added Thursday morning during a \u201cFox & Friends: First\u201d interview. \u201cAnd, to put race in it \u2026 we\u2019re talking about trained professionals. My staff goes through intense training with the FBI, and so they\u2019re not looking at race but it\u2019s measurements. We were appalled when she made this statement.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
