People familiar with the matter told the news outlet that the purchases could rise to as high as $40-$50 billion in the second year of a possible final deal once all tariffs are lifted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials are currently working on hammering out the details of a limited trade agreement that both governments have hinted could be signed when President Trump Donald John TrumpSchedule for additional depositions in impeachment inquiry revealed Sondland attorney disputes key portions of Taylor testimony: report Impeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report MORE and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet in Chile next month.\n\nThe two sides reached an initial deal earlier this month that would postpone an upcoming increase of tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for Beijing drastically increasing imports of American crops. The agreement is meant to provide a brief economic reprieve for both nations as they seek out a broader deal.\n\nChina has already begun increasing its purchases of agricultural goods. It issued waivers for 10 million tons of soybean purchases this week and is mulling approving an additional 4-5 million tons of grains, including wheat, corn and sorghum, according to Bloomberg.\n\nTrump has been quick to hype the deal as a victory for farmers as negotiations continue.\n\n\u201cThe deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country. In fact, there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!\u201d he tweeted this month.\n\nThe deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country.
