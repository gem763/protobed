Here was the president, using charged language in a context that defied its actual meaning.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden: Trump 'an idiot' for saying Russian interference a 'hoax' Biden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike MORE quickly apologized for using that same term during the Clinton impeachment proceedings.

Following a review of the president\u2019s tweets, rallies and media remarks, here are new definitions for some key terms in the Trump lexicon:\n\nNepotism: (n.) Actions whereby powerful officials use their influence to obtain high-level positions for their children. (See: Biden, Hunter. Do not see: Trump, Eric; Trump, Donald Jr., et.al.).\n\nDOJ: (n.)

(See also: Stable)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStable: (adj.)

People with tremendous military training and incredible combat experience who are, in the end, just not that smart.\n\nAllies: (definition still evolving)\n\nActing: (adj.) Refers to a temporary government employee often hired because of skillfulness in taking dictation. (E.g. chief of staff, Homeland Security Secretary, Director of National Intelligence. Subject to change without prior notice.)\n\nChief of Staff: (n.) A government position typically filled by temporary employees on a rotating basis of anywhere from 192 days to 18 months, or until a press conference is held that should not have been held. (See: Acting)\n\nQuid Pro Quo: The president and members of his administration are not required to have a working knowledge of Latin.\n\nAs with many issues, the president may continue to shift, delete or add to these characterizations. New definitions for words such as \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d \u201cemoluments,\u201d \u201cambassador\u201d and \u201cforeign policy\u201d are still under review.\n\nMeanings are fluid.\n\nJoe Ferullo is an award-winning media executive, producer and journalist and former executive vice president of programming for CBS Television Distribution.
