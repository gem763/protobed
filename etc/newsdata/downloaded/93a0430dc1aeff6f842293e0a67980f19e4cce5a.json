When managers talk to me about new projects now, I feel I can work out what work needs to be done.\"\n\nHe business services graduate said university was focused on finishing assignments, whereas the corporate training offered by Infosys made him feel able to operate within the workplace and for clients.\n\nPwC senior associate Tilly Cooper credits the consulting powerhouse's apprenticeship program, in which recruits work full-time at PwC and gain a diploma qualification through the firm, as having more influence on her career success than university.\n\nThe program gives recruits both on-the-job and classroom training in the basics of consulting and dealing with clients, as well as information technology skills.\n\nMs Cooper started out on a traditional uni pathway, but grew frustrated that she learnt more on practical work placements than through the course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d stuck with uni, I think I would have lost motivation along the way,\" she said.\n\n\"I got discouraged by the parts of my degree that weren\u2019t relevant or practical.\"\n\nQuality is key\n\nBut Dawn Bennett, a professor of higher education at Curtin University, warned that the oft-cited solution of more practical experience would not solve concerns among students that they were not prepared for employment after university.\n\n\u201cThe placement piece is really important, but it\u2019s couched as a silver bullet [to employability concerns]. Students also need to understand how their work experience relates to their develop.\u201d\n\nShe said universities need to monitor the quality of the placement, as doing office coffee runs during internships was unlikely to make students more employable.\n\nThis comes as universities face pressure to improve the employability of their graduates. The government this month announced that from next year, graduate employment outcomes will count higher than other measures of success when determining university funding.", "description": "University graduates say their studies do not prepare them for the workplace and firms are stepping up to make up some of that training gap for new recruits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_88/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/092a62db3240fee14b0997608868727a937b9673", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
