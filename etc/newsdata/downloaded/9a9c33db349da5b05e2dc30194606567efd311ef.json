REUTERS/Andreas Gebert/File Photo\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Private equity groups Bain and Advent are doing thorough due diligence on Osram (OSRn.DE) in preparation for a potential takeover offer, Olaf Berlien, the Chief Executive of the German lighting maker said on Thursday.\n\nBain and Advent said in a letter on last month they were prepared to make an offer for Osram at a price \u201cmeaningfully\u201d above that of rival bidder Austrian sensor specialist AMS (AMS.VI).\n\n\u201cI hope it was not a joke\u201d, he said referring to the letter which effectively derailed AMS\u2019s offer.\n\n\u201cTo make it clear, I think there are huge teams in the data rooms. I\u2019m quite sure (of Bain and Advent being serious about this) if they spend the money,\u201d he said on a call with analysts.\n\nAMS\u2019s 4.5 billion euro ($5 billion) takeover offer for Osram fell through last week, but AMS said it would still explore strategic options to pursue an acquisition of the German lighting group after securing a 20% stake.\n\nAMS had sweetened its bid to 41 euros a share after Bain and Advent said that they were prepared to trump the Austrian group\u2019s original offer of 38.50 euros.\n\nBerlien said he was open to a potential new offer from AMS, adding that the terms needed to be right.\n\nHe also said he did not tender his shares in AMS\u2019 tender offer as some of Osram\u2019s concerns had not been addressed while the offer price was not the issue.", "description": "Private equity groups Bain and Advent are doing thorough due diligence on Osram in preparation for a potential takeover offer, Olaf Berlien, the Chief Executive of the German lighting maker said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439300902&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991GQ", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
