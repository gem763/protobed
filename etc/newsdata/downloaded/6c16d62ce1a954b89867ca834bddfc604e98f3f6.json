USA TODAY\n\nThe NCAA has a choice. It can get on board or risk getting run over. It can craft legislation that embraces change or invite change being thrust down its intransigent throats.\n\nThere is still time to get ahead of California\u2019s Fair Pay To Play Act and the like-minded legislation gaining traction in other states; still time to create a progressive national policy on the compensation of college athletes; still time to act before Congress asserts jurisdiction.\n\nThat time, however, is not unlimited. Though California Bill 206 does not take effect until 2023, other states and multiple U.S. Congressmen are contemplating similar legislation on faster tracks. With the most recent Seton Hall sports poll showing Americans favor college athletes being able to profit off their name, image and likeness by a 60-32 margin (with 8% undecided), the pace of change appears to be accelerating.\n\nThe NCAA logo is displayed at midcourt of an NCAA tournament game. (Photo: Matt Slocum, AP)\n\n\u201cI would hope that they would see the tea leaves; that this is coming in some form or fashion,\u201d said Ohio University professor David Ridpath, interim president of the Drake Group. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to stop this train. . .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fairness issue. We\u2019ve jumped the shark. We\u2019ve got coaches making millions of dollars, you\u2019ve got a (multi) billion-dollar TV contract with March Madness. With so much money coming in, to tell an individual that they don\u2019t have the right to own their own image is flat-out wrong.\u201d\n\nSEISMIC CHANGE: Recruiting will shift if endorsements come to college sports\n\nMAJOR VALUE: Elite college athletes could be worth millions if change happen\n\nLAW IMPACT: NCAA president says athletes could turn into employees\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice acknowledged the inequities of the status quo last spring in submitting the report of her Commission on College Basketball, but she resisted making specific recommendations on name, image and likeness (NIL) at that time in deference to pending court cases. Eighteen months later, the NCAA\u2019s Board of Governors is expected to hear proposals from a Federal and State Legislation Working Group on Oct. 29.\n\nTick, tock.\n\n\"While we have made significant progress in recent years, we have not always responded to the needs and rights of our players swiftly,\u201d Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said during the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s Operation Basketball media day. \u201cAnd frankly, we're playing catch-up after years of stagnant rules.\n\n\u201cI hope and trust that not only will there be a plan to put the student-athletes' best interests at the forefront, but that we'll also have a firm plan for implementation at the national level.\"\n\nWhat shape that might take is speculative. Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith, who co-chairs the working group, is on record that its recommendations \u201cwill not result in paying students as employees.\u201d Yet while NCAA President Mark Emmert has called the California bill an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the collegiate model, and has responded by raising the possibility of California schools being ineligible for NCAA championships, he has also said the vast majority of college presidents and athletic administrators, \u201crecognize this is an area where we need to continue to evolve out rules.\u201d\n\nEvolution, of course, can be unpredictable. To some, it means adaptation; to others, extinction. While Texas Tech athletic director Kirby Hocutt is a self-proclaimed \u201cstrong proponent of giving our student-athletes the same rights that any student on our campus has,\u201d Texas Christian AD Jeremiah Donati remains reluctant to abandon NCAA-style amateurism.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019d be a shame to throw it away so haphazardly. ...\u201d Donati told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram last month. \u201cIt has potential to be a wild, wild west situation, which is scary as an athletic director.\u201d\n\nUncertainties abound. While a handful of college athletes have built personal brands appealing to national advertisers \u2013 basketball star Zion Williamson had more than a million Instagram followers before he committed to Duke last year \u2013 the threat of local boosters turning recruiting battles into bidding wars is a widespread concern.\n\n\u201cElite athletes could get a couple hundred thousand a year; I think that\u2019s very reasonable to expect,\u201d said A.J. Maestas, CEO of Navigate Research, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in college and professional sports rights valuations. \u201cWhat\u2019s really difficult to tell is how much of that would be because of the actual economic value of their name, image, likeness as an endorser and how much of that would be just the local interest in attracting those athletes. So I\u2019m guessing that the part that is difficult to predict for us is how much of this would be above-the-table, legalized recruiting efforts.\u201d\n\nThe Drake Group, an organization formed to promote \u201cacademic integrity in collegiate sport,\u201d has issued a position paper proposing that boosters be prohibited from making endorsement deals with college athletes. South Dakota State AD Justin Snell, meanwhile, is not convinced there\u2019s a problem in need of solving.\n\n\u201cMedia covers this in a way that every student-athlete is like an Alabama football player or a Kentucky basketball player,\u201d Snell said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re involved in it, you know that 98 percent of the student-athletes never experience anything like that.\u201d\n\nFor the overwhelming majority of college athletes, a scholarship amounts to a windfall that can ease a family\u2019s financial burden and eliminate years of student debt. But as the salaries of coaches, administrators and conference commissioners have skyrocketed, athletes\u2019 share of the overall pie has shrunk while the perception of exploitation has grown.\n\nAccording to data submitted to the U.S. Department of Education for the 2017-18 fiscal year, the 10 schools that generated the most athletic revenue paid 762 coaches $256.6 million in salary while spending $101 million less on financial aid to their 6,804 athletes. Texas A&M and Florida State both spent more than $2.60 on coaches' salaries for every dollar spent on scholarships.\n\nUniversity financial reports submitted to the NCAA show an even greater gap: $292.7 million in coaches' compensation (including bonuses and benefits) against $161 million in financial aid for athletes.\n\nFrom disparity comes discontent.\n\n\u201cWhy does any kid have to pay to go to the University of Alabama?\u201d asked Diana Taurasi, the former University of Connecticut women\u2019s basketball star. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. Off one bowl game this year, they can cover everyone\u2019s tuition. Why shouldn\u2019t that be a free school to go to if you can get in and your academic standard and all that. Why should you pay $30,000 to go to a school that\u2019s making an abundant amount of money? That\u2019s ludicrous.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how things work in college athletics. Because university athletic departments operate on a not-for-profit basis, they generally spend what a bottom-line business might show as a surplus. Two of the three schools to report more than $200 million in athletic revenues for the 2017-18 fiscal year \u2013 Texas and Ohio State \u2013 both spent more than $200 million on their sports programs during the same period. Because of NCAA regulations and scholarship limitations, much of that spending is devoted to facilities and amenities that aid recruiting but add no cash to athletes\u2019 pockets.\n\n\u201cI do think there are a lot of things we can do for student-athletes to give them more opportunities and more money, but don\u2019t think (the California bill) is the right way to do it,\u201d New Mexico State football coach Doug Martin said. \u201cIn my opinion, this is going to destroy college athletics. States like New Mexico, you are not going to have college athletics. Only the power conference schools will be able to survive this in my opinion because they are going to have the money to do it. Nobody else is going to be able to sustain what they are doing.\u201d\n\nWith the benefit of his school\u2019s power conference affiliation, Florida State football coach Willie Taggart, sees California\u2019s Fair Pay To Play Act as \u201ca helluva bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they can profit from their likeness, I think that\u2019s fair,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a new time. We don\u2019t live where we used to live. We don\u2019t live there anymore. Times are different. You always hear people talk about doing what\u2019s best for the student-athlete. ... I think them profiting from their likeness is good. I do think they should get it when they graduate.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the ultimate goal when you go to school is to graduate, and I think personally \u2013 and I think we all know \u2013 we all graduated from school knowing that that\u2019s when you need the money the most.\u201d\n\nStill to be determined is how much and how soon money may be made available to college athletes, what rules the NCAA might enact to regulate that commerce, and whether change can be agreed upon before it is imposed by politicians.\n\n\u201cThey can be proactive or they can end up being reactive and it will be done for them,\u201d Ridpath said. \u201cI agree with the NCAA that it should be able to make its own rules, but the rules have to be constitutional. They have to be fair. And I think, honestly, from the federal perspective, they have to be forced. And this is eventually going to force them to do something.\u201d\n\nWith contributions from Evan Barnes, Memphis Commercial Appeal; Steve Berkowitz, USA Today; Charles Bryce, San Angelo Standard-Times; Jason Groves, Las Cruces Sun-News; Emily Horos, The Arizona Republic; Kelly Lyell, The Coloradoan; Wayne McGahee III, Tallahassee Democrat, Jeff Metcalfe, The Arizona Republic; Fletcher Page, Cincinnati Enquirer; Cameron Teague Robinson, Louisville Courier Journal; Orion Sang, Detroit Free Press; Adam Sparks, The Tennessean; Blake Toppmeyer, Knoxville News Sentinel; Josh Vitale, Montgomery Advertiser; Curt Weiler, Tallahassee Democrat; Mike Wilson, Knoxville News Sentinel; Matt Zimmer, Sioux Falls Argus-Leader.", "description": "California's Fair Pay To Play Act and pushes by other lawmakers are forcing the NCAA to pick up the pace of change to deal with the amateurism issues.", "authors": ["Tim Sullivan", "Published A.M.
