I felt I was getting old and ugly and I wanted to do something about it.\n\n\"I flew over to Istanbul and was taken to a lovely hotel. I then went over to the clinic for the hair translant. I was given some food, a drink and everything was spoken to me in English so I knew exactly what was going on.\n\n\"The transplant went really well and a week on it is coming along very nicely. The aftercare from the team in Turkey has also been very good and they have been checking up on me.\n\n(Image: Caters News)\n\n(Image: Caters News)\n\n\"The trouble is I have the urge to get something else done now.\"\n\nSpeaking about the mystery benefactor who paid for the procedure, he added: \"She is very successful and said she admires my bravery and honesty, then she offered to pay for it all.\"\n\n\"It was \u00a33,550 including flights and hotel. I am really grateful for her generosity. Many people will criticise me and question why I didn\u2019t pay for it myself but if someone offers then I am not going to say no.\"\n\n(Image: Caters News)\n\n(Image: Caters News)\n\nMr Barton first hit the headlines after revealing he had a free nose job on the NHS.\n\nHe later applied for free Botox treatment for life to combat the anxiety his \u2018new-found fame\u2019 had provoked.\n\nHe spent \u00a350,000 trying to achieve the perfect appearance which included \u00a320,000 on his teeth and \u00a35,000 on Botox.\n\nHe later revealed he was declaring himself bankrupt after racking up debts of \u00a335,000 living a Champagne lifestyle, blowing up to \u00a32,000 on a night out.\n\nThen last year he revealed how he was earning \u00a32,000-a-week appearing on sex webcams with former Big Brother contestant Bex Shiner.\n\nHe told BirminghamLive he was making a fortune dressing up as a woman under the alter-ego of Karen Katona.", "description": "The mystery benefactor told Sam Barton, from Sutton Coldfield, to 'stay ruthless' after he thanked her for covering the cost of his transplant", "authors": ["Andy Richardson", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Caters News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663184.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-STRANGER-PAID-FOR-HAIR-TRANSPLANT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
