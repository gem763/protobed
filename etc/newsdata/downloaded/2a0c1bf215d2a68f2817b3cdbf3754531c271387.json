This story is about the virtue of being boring, a perhaps underappreciated thing in our day and age. This is a story about not changing your life and how much better that can make it. That\u2019s what Tesla is selling in terms of renewable energy: your life, but with fewer fossil fuels. Your house, powered by solar.\n\nI wanted to know what that would be like in reality. That\u2019s how I find myself in an Australian mansion powered by Tesla\u2019s solar panels and Powerwall batteries, driving a Model X. I can tell you firsthand that renewable energy isn\u2019t exciting. That\u2019s what makes it so compelling.\n\nOn the drive to the mansion, signs warn me to be careful of wildlife, complete with a portrait of what I am guessing is a wombat. A representative from Tesla picked me up at the nearest airport to Byron Bay and sat next to me while I figured out how to drive on the left. (Lane tracking helped.) When I arrive, I count the bedrooms. There are five, decorated with a minimum of personality. The master bedroom is entirely white and approximately the size of my last studio apartment. Besides the walk-in closet and king-size bed, there\u2019s also an enormous sunken tub that looks out at what I am told is called the hinterland. Among my neighbors in the hinterland are some manner of Hemsworth brothers.\n\nThe tub is big enough that there\u2019s a bench you can sit on. So, naturally, I run a bath and then slide into it to watch the sunset. Here I am, at the very first Tesla Destination in Australia, a home just outside Byron Bay, a surfer / hippie town that\u2019s been overrun by rich people, possibly as a result of Hemsworthiness. The point of a Tesla Destination, as I understand it, is that it\u2019s a place with a charger for your electric car. In my case, this is a Tesla Model X, an SUV that Musk has described as a \u201cFaberg\u00e9 egg.\u201d\n\nBut best of all, you don\u2019t have to think about any of it\n\nTesla Destinations are mostly hospitality industry locations in the US; the mansion where I am staying is rented out by an Australian company for groups. It can sleep 10, according to the hospitality company, and \u201cstarts\u201d (?) at $1,670 AUD a night. It \u2014 this has to be said \u2014 has about the same aesthetic as a porn mansion: largely empty, echoey, vaguely \u201chigh end,\u201d and with a pervading sense that no one actually lives here.\n\nBesides the electric charger, the mansion is also fitted with solar panels and a Tesla Powerwall, a battery for storing the energy they generate. While I live for dumb thrills like driving an expensive car I don\u2019t own on the wrong side of the road, I am, in fact, at the mansion to experience the clean energy lifestyle Tesla is selling.\n\nThe Model X and mansion are, in some ways, emblematic of the Tesla lifestyle and approach. The dream of this lifestyle is that you can have everything you already have but without fossil fuels. You can keep on driving a car. You can live in your porn mansion entirely on renewable energy and sell any extra power you harvest to the grid. But best of all, you don\u2019t have to think about any of it.\n\nIt takes me a while to sort out the kitchen when it\u2019s time for dinner. Besides the \u201cactual\u201d kitchen, there\u2019s also what appears to be a butler\u2019s pantry, which is where all of the dishes are located. I turn on the stove and heat water for spaghetti.\n\nInstead of focusing on pure do-goodery, which has a kind of limited market, the electric car would be an aspirational good\n\nIt\u2019s true that this is a story about Tesla energy, but it\u2019s also true that we all use energy all the time. The mundane tasks I engage in as I settle into the mansion \u2014 the bath, cooking dinner \u2014 of course, require energy. I can watch the little jiggles of energy required on the Tesla app. All day long, the mansion has been running on solar energy, and it continues to do so right up until I plug in the Model X to charge. That battery draws so much energy that the house switches to the grid.\n\nSo I\u2019m running on the grid energy when I wake up the next day and make breakfast. The leather couch in the main room (what the marketing materials call an \u201copen concept living and lounge space\u201d) is sunken in a large rectangular depression called a conversation pit. I decide I\u2019d rather work there than at the table, so I settle in, plug in my laptop, and start working.\n\nDuring my three-day stay at the mansion, Tesla will abruptly reverse course on its abrupt decision to shutter all of its stores and move all of its sales online. Actually, I wind up writing that story shortly after I arrive at the mansion before I make dinner. The company will increase the price of its cars. Musk will accuse the US Securities and Exchange Commission of making an \u201cunconstitutional power grab\u201d over his tweets. (I will write this story while eating toast in the conversation pit.) Despite living and working for days in what is probably the best example I have seen of a luxury environmentalist lifestyle, I find myself wondering what the catch is.\n\nTesla\u2019s first \u201cmaster plan,\u201d dated to 2006, involved making a luxury electric car that focused on the fun rather than the environmental prospects of an electric car: a sports car with the kind of pickup that would make gearheads like Jay Leno excited. Instead of focusing on pure do-goodery, which has a kind of limited market, the electric car would be an aspirational good. Then, after proving that it was possible to make an electric car desirable, there would be cheaper versions, and the profits from those could be used by Tesla to provide solar power.\n\nThe second master plan, out a decade later, shifted Tesla\u2019s focus from cars to energy. \u201cThe point of all this was, and remains, accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, so that we can imagine far into the future and life is still good,\u201d Musk wrote in the document. Published in July, it preceded Tesla\u2019s August 1st, 2016, announcement that the company was acquiring SolarCity, which was then the largest maker of solar panels in the US. (SolarCity was founded by Lyndon and Peter Rive, Musk\u2019s cousins. Musk was chairman of both companies at the time and was SolarCity\u2019s largest shareholder.) By bringing the two companies together, Musk wrote, Tesla could \u201ccreate a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world.\u201d The acquisition was completed that November.\n\nIn 2017, Tesla began taking preorders for its solar roof. The pitch was pretty simple: tile-sized solar panels that could be used as a home\u2019s, well, roof. The tiles look the same as normal roof tiles, so it\u2019s not even visually obvious that there\u2019s anything harvesting energy up there. Using Tesla\u2019s calculator, if my landlord were to install the solar tiles on 40 percent of my apartment building\u2019s roof, it would cost $157,100, about five times more than conventional roofing. But, as the energy calculator points out, the high upfront cost can be amortized out \u2014 plus, there\u2019s a $27,000 tax credit to help sweeten the deal.\n\nI was staying in a mansion and driving a fancy car in a popular tourist town\n\nThough the mansion had solar panels rather than the tiles, it seems like a pretty good representation of what Tesla\u2019s second master plan hoped to achieve. Living in Tesla\u2019s imagined future, most of the activities of my life weren\u2019t especially changed by switching the source from which the house drew energy. The only thing that might have qualified as a difference was me checking the Tesla app to see what was going on with my energy usage.\n\nIt was luxurious, sure. I was also aware of how much shabbier my own lifestyle was by comparison. I was staying in a mansion and driving a fancy car in a popular tourist town. If I weren\u2019t so badly dressed, I would have looked impressive. Whenever I drove into Byron Bay, people asked about the Model X \u2014 not about the car\u2019s electric engine, but mostly about the falcon wing doors. I spent most of those days with a low-level growl of anxiety that I would break something worth more than I am.\n\nIt\u2019s undeniably seductive to be promised free energy without sacrificing any amenities. In my life, I have made some of those sacrifices because I like the environment and also because I\u2019m cheap. Unlike most Americans, I don\u2019t own a car; I bike or I take public transit. It takes me longer to get where I\u2019m going, and sometimes I arrive sweaty. But I\u2019m healthy, I don\u2019t have any disabilities, and I don\u2019t haul around any kids. Plus, I live in an area where public transit is possible. There are a lot of reasons Americans own cars, but the biggest one is necessity. The next biggest? Convenience. An electric car offers everything a gas car does but without the pollution.\n\n\u201cThe only thing stopping it from happening is us \u2014 the collective us.\u201d\n\nI am often surprised by the discussion among environmental activists of what people should do. It only rarely takes into account what people might want or what might limit their choices. Here, too, Tesla has suggested that very little needs to change: you can live in your home without pulling energy from the grid or by pulling minimal energy. Engaging in an environmentally friendly lifestyle doesn\u2019t require you, the consumer, to give up comfort or change your values, Tesla\u2019s home energy products promise. You don\u2019t even need to lobby your local government for better transit options.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving towards this world of energy abundance... for really, really low cost,\u201d says Drew Baglino, the vice president of technology at Tesla. \u201cThese technologies are ready ... The only thing stopping it from happening is us \u2014 the collective us.\u201d\n\nSolar and wind energy are basically free once you set up the infrastructure to take advantage of them. Over the last two decades, the cost of that infrastructure has come down. And batteries are a crucial part of that because you can\u2019t get solar energy on a cloudy day or wind energy on a still one. A battery, however, allows you to store energy from a sunny day to run your home on a cloudy one. After all, why should your lifestyle be altered by something as annoying as the weather? Why should your lifestyle change at all?\n\nFree \u2014 or at least cheap \u2014 energy isn\u2019t likely to make a difference to the people who stay in the mansion. They aren\u2019t paying the electric bills. But for Australians like Heidi Lovakovic, 57, who got fitted out with 17 solar panels and a Powerwall in May 2018, it\u2019s made a massive dent in her energy bill. She gets billed quarterly, and before the installation, her power bill was $800 AUD in the summer.\n\nI meet her in a suburb outside of Adelaide. The solar panels on her house\u2019s roof are immediately visible from the street. Unlike the mansion, her one-story cottage feels lived in from the moment I ring the bell and a small dog begins to bark. Lovakovic shows me in and offers me tea from her neat and unfussy kitchen. The general decor reminds me of the American Midwest \u2014 more specifically, Ohio, and even more specifically, my grandmother\u2019s house, right down to the lace table runner on the dining room table. The mansion is a kind of fancy hotel; this is a home.\n\nThe installation of the solar panels and the Powerwall eliminated her energy bill, she tells me. And because she sells electricity back to the grid, she sometimes gets a credit on her statements from the electric company. Obligingly, she gets out her bills to show me.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful. We haven\u2019t had a bill.\u201d\n\nLovakovic had previously tried to put solar panels on her home, but she wasn\u2019t able to get a line of credit. So when the South Australian government announced in early 2018 that 1,100 people who lived in South Australia Housing Trust properties \u2014 as she does \u2014 could apply to have Tesla\u2019s solar panels and Powerwall installed in their homes, she signed up. The network was up and running in July. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a bill.\u201d\n\nLovakovic\u2019s house is part of a larger-scale attempt to move to sustainable energy: a virtual power plant. Basically, a bunch of Tesla Powerwalls in a bunch of people\u2019s houses in the suburbs of Adelaide are linked together. They gather energy from the solar panels on the residences\u2019 roofs, and they can supply the neighborhood during a blackout. The first phase of 100 homes started in February 2018. When I visit, Tesla is scaling up to the second phase of 1,000 homes.\n\nOkay, sure. But why South Australia? The short answer is that the grid sucks there, and the slightly longer answer is that there\u2019s less energy regulation in Australia than there is in the US. (Though it should be said that there\u2019s a similar project in Vermont with Green Mountain Power.) The even longer answer is that South Australia has had trouble maintaining reliable power for years, and Australia deliberately made an effort to move to renewable energy, says Sam Crafter, 45, the executive director of energy implementation for the South Australian government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve ended up being the demonstration place for energy,\u201d he says.\n\nIn 2002, South Australia had very little renewable energy. Concerns about climate change prompted the Australian government to set up incentives for renewable energy in 2006. The state has set an ambitious goal of getting to 75 percent renewable energy in 2025 or 2030. South Australia, in particular, was an ideal place to integrate renewables into the infrastructure: in 2016 and 2017, huge weather events caused a statewide blackout. \u201cIt brought into focus how risky our situation is as a state,\u201d Crafter says.\n\nSo the state put out a call for renewable technology that might help alleviate the situation, and Tesla put in a bid for its linked system, called a virtual power plant or VPP, and suggested using Australia\u2019s housing trust to deploy it. That way, the government owns the batteries and solar panels as well as the homes where they\u2019re installed. Those customers, who are mostly low-income, are most likely to benefit from cheaper power bills directly, but any excess energy they draw can shore up their neighbors\u2019 homes as well.\n\nLower bills were a theme among the people I spoke to who\u2019d had Powerwalls installed in the first portion of the plan. Sherallee Andrews, 58, told me that her bills ranged from $300 to $400 AUD quarterly before her 17 panels and Powerwall were installed in April 2018. Now, she says, the bills average around $12. Another customer, Victoria Townsend, 45, had 20 panels and a Powerwall installed in April 2018. \u201cWe noticed the benefits quickly over the summer,\u201d she says. Her bills used to be $340 to $450 AUD quarterly, and now her statements appear as credits. The energy company owes her about $130 AUD, she says.\n\nThis is part of the selling point for VPPs. But there\u2019s another one to keep in mind, says Gerbrand Ceder, a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. Unlike the current electric grid, VPPs aren\u2019t centralized. That means they could potentially make the grid more secure.\n\n\u201cThe Powerwall is like power security,\u201d Ceder says. (He owns one.) \u201cAs long as your power comes from one centralized place, there are major security issues in stabilizing the grid. I see the benefit of highly distributed power as a security issue.\u201d A distributed grid has many vulnerabilities but no one large vulnerability, Ceder points out. That makes events like the US Northeast blackout in 2003, when an estimated 50 million people were left without power because of some rogue tree branches, less likely.\n\nWhen I ask Andrews if the battery made a difference for blackouts, she laughs. \u201cWith the battery, we hardly notice blackouts.\u201d Townsend tells me she hasn\u2019t really noticed blackouts, either. \u201cThe light flashes once.\u201d But you don\u2019t realize it\u2019s a blackout unless you check the app, Townsend says, because the lights stay on. I am reminded, again, that the strongest selling point for this technology is exactly how little it will change for the person who installs it.\n\nTesla still mostly sells and leases cars; revenue from automotive sales and rentals in the first quarter this year totaled $3.72 billion. Solar energy generation and storage \u2014 solar panels plus Powerwalls and Powerpacks \u2014 was $324 million, a fraction of what the company makes from its cars. It\u2019s also a drop from the first quarter last year when Tesla had energy sales of $410 million. (Tesla declined to say how much of that revenue was from energy storage specifically.)\n\nIn fact, Tesla\u2019s market share in solar energy has been shrinking. When Tesla first bought SolarCity, it was the biggest player in residential solar energy. Last year, Tesla slid to second place, behind Sunrun. In June 2018, the company stopped selling its solar panels at Home Depot. That tanked sales: energy generation and storage revenue sank in the fourth quarter last year to $371.5 million, a 7 percent decline. (A former Tesla employee told Reuters that Tesla \u201cdidn\u2019t appreciate the significance\u201d of the Home Depot deal.) Then, in February, the company announced that all solar and storage would be sold online.\n\nIn April, Tesla announced that it was cutting prices on its solar panels in response to its drop in market share. Though the price on Powerwalls hasn\u2019t dropped, Tesla says that it\u2019s simplified the process of putting a Powerwall in and lowered installation pricing so more Powerwalls are being put in homes daily.\n\nThe battery squeeze has gotten so intense\n\nTesla isn\u2019t the biggest player in consumer energy storage, either; that\u2019s likely Sonnen, which was bought in February by Shell. (Yes, the oil company.) Sonnen was founded in 2010, and has installed 40,000 battery packs worldwide to date, according to a Financial Times report. (Tesla says it\u2019s installed more than that worldwide, but declined to say how many.) Sonnen received permission to build its own version of a VPP in Germany. Vivint Solar, LG, Eos, Sunverge, and Nissan all dabble in the space, too. More companies have jumped in as the cost of lithium-ion batteries has come down.\n\nPart of what differentiates battery companies is the supply chain. Right now, Tesla is predominantly using Panasonic\u2019s supply chain, says Craig Irwin, an analyst for Roth Capital Partners. While Irwin doesn\u2019t see any problems with battery production in the next five to 10 years \u2014 \u201cnot on lithium, not on cobalt, not on separators, or electrolytes, I don\u2019t see it\u201d \u2014 Panasonic will always get the best price on things coming from its own supply chain. For Tesla to have an advantage on materials, the company would need to create its own supply chain, something Irwin doesn\u2019t see happening for at least the next 10 years.\n\nOn the residential storage side, Tesla isn\u2019t just using Panasonic cells; it\u2019s using Samsung and other suppliers. That\u2019s because not every supplier makes every kind of cell. Tesla\u2019s battery issues may make expansion tough and expensive, even though Tesla recently bought Maxwell Technologies, a battery company known for its dry electrode technology. If the new technology works out, that means a massive reduction in how much it costs to make each battery cell because no solvent is required, meaning it doesn\u2019t need to be recovered and recycled. Maxwell also has all-ceramic separators, which might make batteries last longer. (Tesla declined to comment on the Maxwell acquisition\u2019s purpose.) The battery squeeze has gotten so intense that Musk, in a June 2019 shareholder meeting, discussed the possibility of Tesla getting into mining.\n\nThere is also the cautionary example of Vieques, Puerto Rico. In September 2017, Hurricane Maria \u2014 the worst natural disaster ever to hit the island \u2014 knocked out the lights and power for all of Puerto Rico where 3.3 million Americans live. Tesla employees landed on the island a week later, offering a proposal to create \u201cmicrogrids\u201d to produce and supply power separately from the island\u2019s main grid. It wasn\u2019t the first time Tesla had done this: on Ta\u2018\u016b an island in American Samoa, all 600 residents were now using a solar battery power system. Tesla had also built a solar and battery farm on Kauai, a Hawaiian island. More recently, Tesla also helps manage energy in Samoa where the company helps balance the load of energy on the island using an 8MW Powerpack. (The software also controls a diesel generator, just in case.)\n\nWhile Tesla did successfully get electricity up and running at one project, larger changes didn\u2019t really happen. \u201cAt one water treatment facility, the battery sat dormant and, during HuffPost\u2019s visit to the site in late February, the field of solar panels was overgrown with weeds and brush,\u201d Alexander Kauffman wrote for HuffPost.\n\nThere were also regulatory hurdles in Puerto Rico that Tesla didn\u2019t face in Australia. Australia generally has more lax regulation around power than the US does. That\u2019s one reason why Tesla has projects there. Regulatory changes have happened in Puerto Rico that should make it easier for renewables, including rules that make it easier for microgrids to get started.\n\nBecause cars are so important to Tesla, they are likely to take priority\n\nAustralia may represent the high water mark of Tesla\u2019s power ambitions so far, with a favorable regulatory framework, a government investment in renewable energy, and plenty of money to spend on upkeep. It is the second-hottest renewable energy market for commercial energy products in the world, says Irwin. The hottest market in the world right now, Irwin says, is Germany.\n\nBut fundamentally, according to Irwin, the biggest thing pushing battery technology right now isn\u2019t energy storage systems for homes or utilities. It\u2019s electric cars. \u201cThe success of residential energy storage systems and utility energy storage systems will be derivative of the EV pull,\u201d he says. That makes the energy storage products a nice business adjacency for Tesla \u2014 the company certainly has plenty of engineering expertise \u2014 but it also suggests that it\u2019s unlikely to be the main driver for Tesla in the next several years, or ever.\n\nBecause cars are so important to Tesla, they are likely to take priority. Last year, there was a shortage of cells as Tesla began ramping up its Model 3 production. That slowed the production of energy products. The company pointed out in its fourth quarter letter to shareholders last year that new energy production lines have been built out at Gigafactory 1 where Tesla manufactures its energy products, including the Powerwall and Powerpack.\n\nTesla is about to launch another new car, the Model Y. In April, Musk tweeted that Panasonic\u2019s pace of battery production was constraining the production of the Model 3. \u201cBatteries will run out if Tesla starts to sell the Model Y and expands its business next year,\u201d Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga said in May, according to Bloomberg News. \u201cWhat will we do then?\u201d\n\nAs I write this in California, we are entering fire season, which, theoretically, starts in June and ends in December but is beginning to feel permanent. My local electric company, PG&E, has announced that there may be days-long outages for some of its customers this summer. They have also been responsible for more than 1,500 California fires since 2014. That means the energy company is likely to deactivate more power lines this summer, out of caution, UC Berkeley\u2019s Ceder says. So hot, dry, windy weather is power outage weather all summer long. And the outages have already started: already, Yuba and Butte counties had their power switched off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. \u201cWe\u2019re all worried about it for the elderly. We\u2019re worried about it because we could see people\u2019s power shut off not for a day or two but potentially a week.\u201d The city of Calistoga alone may lose power 15 times this season, the Bloomberg report said.\n\nMost people aren\u2019t prepared for this, and that includes me. About three weeks ago, my mother called to ask if I had bought a solar generator and a battery, just in case. I still haven\u2019t done it. Most Californians haven\u2019t, though the situation has boosted interest in home energy systems. According to BloombergNEF, almost 10,000 home battery systems were in place last year, up from just 400 in 2016. But the cost was steep, averaging $16,400 once incentives were factored in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to make the economics on that work.\u201d\n\nThat cost helps explain why some people believe the Powerwall and consumer solar panels aren\u2019t the real game for Tesla energy. \u201cI never would have imagined that: someone showing off a battery as a status symbol,\u201d says Sam Jaffe, an analyst with Cairn Energy Research Advisors. \u201cIt\u2019s neat, it\u2019s modern, it looks good, you look cool, I guess. It still puzzles me that a battery can be sexy.\u201d That might make it more like a \u201chalo\u201d car, a representation for the brand that isn\u2019t really affordable or practical for the vast majority of consumers.\n\nThe product Jaffe flags as being most significant to Tesla\u2019s energy business is the Powerpack. \u201cThe Powerpack is a very competitive and well-engineered product that\u2019s always going to be one of the primary choices to be used in a utility-scaled system,\u201d Jaffe says. He\u2019d also guess that it\u2019s probably a larger proportion of the business than the Powerwall.\n\nThe basic issue is economic: it costs more to make a lot of little things than a few big things. And Tesla\u2019s industrial-sized Powerpack battery makes more sense for businesses and utilities than a Powerwall or VPP might. There are places where VPPs consisting of Powerwalls are useful \u2014 near the edges of the grid, for instance, or on an unstable grid where there\u2019s enough wealth that people can afford it. But even with that taken into account, \u201cit\u2019s really hard to make the economics on that work,\u201d Jaffe says. \u201cYou\u2019d need to have such a dramatic drop in battery pricing for that to matter.\u201d\n\nThat means large-scale utility systems are going to dwarf whatever happens in our own homes, pretty much always. And so Tesla has installed 42 Powerpacks at an Osaka station for the Kintetsu Railway as a backup in case of emergency. But it\u2019s pretty small as backups go, with just enough juice to get a stranded train into the station. Tesla batteries also power mini-grids in Eritrea.\n\nBut an even larger-scale Powerpack installation is in Australia: the Hornsdale Power Reserve, a 147-mile drive north of Adelaide. The 100MW / 129MWh lithium-ion battery, the largest in the world, stores energy generated by a nearby wind farm.\n\nLike the VPP, Hornsdale exists to lower energy prices while increasing the stability of the grid. The battery, which cost about $90.6 million AUD, generated revenue of $13.1 million AUD in the first six months of 2018, according to The Guardian. About $2 million AUD came from the South Australian government\u2019s contract with Neoen, the French company that owns the battery. The rest came from trading on the energy market or from sales on stored electricity.\n\nThe Hornsdale battery dabbles in the \u201cfrequency or ancillary services market,\u201d which is a fancy way of saying that the battery does stuff to make sure there\u2019s enough energy to meet demand. In the first four months of its operation, the Hornsdale battery dropped prices on the market by 90 percent, according to a study presented by McKinsey in 2018.\n\nAgain, here, the goal is to allow South Australian residents to essentially live their ordinary lives, without any special awareness of the renewable energy that\u2019s making the market cheaper and more stable. A successful execution of the Hornsdale project is one that residents hardly think of. They just notice their energy bills have dropped.\n\nOne big hope for this kind of battery is that it can be used to replace power plants that are at the end of their lifespan. Last year, Tesla agreed to supply PG&E with a new Powerpack project that would be even larger than the one at Hornsdale. The project was approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, but there\u2019s been a hitch: PG&E\u2019s impending bankruptcy.\n\nIf Musk is to be believed, Tesla energy is where the action is this year\n\nThe utility company was found to be responsible for the Camp fire, a wildfire that burned a record 153,336 acres. PG&E may have to pay as much as $30 billion as a result of liability for fires in 2017 and 2018, according to Bloomberg. (That excludes fines or other punitive payments.) The specter of bankruptcy may scare the planned battery storage unit out of existence, but it hasn\u2019t yet. PG&E spokesman Paul Doherty told me that the company \u201ccontinues to move forward with this project.\u201d PG&E is aiming to have the battery online by December 31st, 2020, Doherty said.\n\nPG&E isn\u2019t the only company struggling. In February, Tesla announced that it was closing most of its stores and laying off some sales staff to save money. I had actually just arrived at the mansion two weeks later when Tesla reversed itself with an announcement that many of its stores would, in fact, stay open. I wrote about the announcement using the stored energy from the Powerwall battery. A more recent event suggests that Tesla, which is never especially financial stable at the best of times, was in real trouble: on May 16th, an email from Musk leaked. Though Tesla had just raised $2.7 billion this year to help the company stay afloat, Musk\u2019s email suggested that it would only last 10 months unless severe cost-cutting measures were introduced.\n\nStill, if Musk is to be believed, Tesla energy is where the action is this year. The Model Y unveiling event occurred in Los Angeles while I was in Adelaide interviewing Powerwall customers. I ended up watching it later in my hotel room. From the stage, I watched Musk declare, \u201cThis is the year of the solar roof and Powerwall.\u201d Model 3 production had pulled battery resources to the car. But now that production had smoothed out, Musk said, \u201cwe\u2019re excited about the solar roof, solar retrofit, and Powerwall.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcited\u201d struck me as the wrong word. The thing I appreciated the most about the battery-powered electricity I had seen firsthand was how boring it was. It was life as I knew it but powered almost exclusively by renewable energy without fossil fuels. The most promising thing about it was how little I\u2019d had to change at all.\n\nCorrection: This article originally misstated Sonnen\u2019s annual output; it has installed 40,000 battery packs worldwide to date, not annually.\n\nUpdate 7:11PM E.T.: Adds Tesla\u2019s claims about how many residential battery systems it has installed relative to Sonnen.", "description": "I stayed in a house in South Australia that was primarily powered by solar energy, which was made possible through Tesla\u2019s batteries. Then I saw a virtual power plant of homes like that one linked together. Tesla Energy is imagining a future that looks a lot like our present but with fewer fossil fuels. What does that mean for us?", "authors": ["Elizabeth Lopatto", "Jun"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ebC8DYfGnm8GupT9Ak1dhL_dHpI=/0x147:2040x1215/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16502116/VRG_ILLO_3296_001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-25"}
