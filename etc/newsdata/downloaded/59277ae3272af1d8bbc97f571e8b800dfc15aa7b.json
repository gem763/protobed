In the spirit of resistance and with great contempt for their system, I am choosing silence over freedom,\u201d Hammond said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI am opposed to all grand juries, but I am opposed to this one in particular because it is part of the government\u2019s ongoing war on free speech, journalists and whistleblowers,\u201d Hammond continued. \u201cAs an anarchist, I am not part of their social contract, and do not recognize the legitimacy of their laws and courts.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Alexandria confirmed Hammond was found in contempt but declined to comment further.\n\nHammond was arrested in 2012 and charged in connection with several computer crimes conducted by the hacktivist group Anonymous and an offshoot, AntiSec, including hacking Strategic Forecasting, also known as Stratfor, a Texas-based private intelligence firm. He pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy in 2013 and was nearing the end of his prison sentence when he was recently moved to Alexandria and asked to appear.\n\nData stolen in the Stratfor hack was later provided to WikiLeaks and released online.\n\nManning, 31, served nearly seven years in prison for supplying WikiLeaks with a separate cache of classified material for publication, including hundreds of thousands of State Department cables and sensitive military documents. She was summoned to testify in front of a grand jury in Alexandria earlier this year, but she similarly refused to answer questions, was found in contempt and jailed accordingly.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Alexandria have since unsealed criminal charges against WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange related to his solicitation and publication of documents provided by Manning. He has not been charged in connection with the Stratfor hack.\n\nIt was not immediate clear what sanctions Hammond may face for refusing to cooperate with grand jury proceedings. Manning is currently being fined $1,000 for not complying with a similar court order, translating to a combined total of upwards of $102,000 as of earlier this week, according to her supporters.\n\nAssange, a 48-year-old Australian, is currently jailed in London fighting a U.S. extradition request. A British judge ordered him to remain held Friday pending extradition proceedings currently slated to start Feb. 25.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
