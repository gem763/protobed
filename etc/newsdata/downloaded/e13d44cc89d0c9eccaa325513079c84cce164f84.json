He appears to enjoy exercising the pardon power\u2014an anonymous White House official once described it as Trump\u2019s \u201cfavorite thing\u201d to The Washington Post\u2014in part because the granting of clemency allows him to cut through the usual procedures that constrain him from doing as he likes. By declaring a person pardoned, that is, Trump can literally make it so.\n\nQuinta Jurecic: Impeachment, but without the moral clarity\n\nBut there are some things in the world that are not amenable to being reshaped at the president\u2019s whimsy. Among them is the weather. If it is raining, it is raining, whether or not Donald Trump tells you that he is getting wet.\n\nThe philosopher Hannah Arendt has been much quoted over the past several years on the matter of lying in politics, but it\u2019s her work on the nature of democracy\u2014in the sense of a shared political life among citizens\u2014that offers the greatest insight when it comes to Trump\u2019s authoritarianism and his falsehoods. The core of Arendt\u2019s argument is that, as she puts it, \u201cmen, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world\u201d\u2014in other words, that we exist buffeted by the actions of others and never entirely in control of our own fate. Democratic politics, in her view, requires an embrace of this unpredictability and an acceptance of the world as shared. She contrasts this with the desire of the monarch or the tyrant to maintain control and shape reality to their will. Trump is an atypical tyrant in that he is more interested in declaring the world to be a certain way than he is in actually putting in the work to shape it, but the control he demands over truth is absolute.\n\nArendt\u2019s point is that there is something undemocratic about the refusal to admit that one lives in a world in which not everything is under one\u2019s control\u2014that other people exist and will be able to determine independently if a hurricane is not coming when the president says it is. And because such a world is undemocratic, it is also lonely, cut off from the flow of life with other people. It has no room for conversation and debate, much less dissent. \u201cI am all alone (poor me) in the White House,\u201d Trump tweeted in December 2018, slamming congressional Democrats for refusing to follow his legislative agenda.\n\nWriting in The Atlantic, David Graham described Trump\u2019s effort to \u201cmake [Hurricane Dorian\u2019s presence in Alabama] real by sheer force of anger.\u201d Notably, the Times story on the political pressure placed on NOAA quotes a \u201csenior administration official\u201d suggesting that the Birmingham office, as the paper puts it, \u201chad been motivated by a desire to embarrass the president more than concern for the safety of people in Alabama.\u201d The suggestion, the Times notes, was offered \u201cwithout evidence.\u201d It is striking that the administration\u2019s instinct was to see NOAA Birmingham\u2019s actions as an affront to the president, rather than considering whether they might have been directed by a responsibility to the people of Alabama or an allegiance to the facts of the forecast. Everything orbits around Trump\u2014the only person whose experience of the world matters, and who can therefore dictate the terms of reality.", "description": "Trump insists on editing reality to conform to his own needs\u2014if necessary, with a Sharpie.", "authors": ["Quinta Jurecic", "Contributing Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19254560296334/facebook.jpg?1568219299", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
