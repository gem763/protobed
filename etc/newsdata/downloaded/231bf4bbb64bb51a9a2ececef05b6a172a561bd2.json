Below are all of the answers to all of the key questions as Britain braces for three weeks of Brexit chaos.\n\nWhat happened today?\n\nIn simple terms the Brexit negotiations went up in flames. Ms Merkel reportedly told Mr Johnson the only way for the two sides to agree a deal would be if the PM agreed for Northern Ireland to stay in the EU's customs union 'forever'.\n\nSuch an approach would avoid the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and would mean the Irish backstop could be scrapped.\n\nBut it would also mean Northern Ireland effectively being separated from the rest of the UK.\n\nMr Johnson apparently told Ms Merkel that her position meant a deal was 'essentially impossible, not just now but ever'.\n\nDonald Tusk, the president of the European Council, then upped the stakes as he publicly criticised Mr Johnson.\n\nMr Tusk claimed the PM was trying to win 'some stupid blame game' as he accused him of not actually wanting a deal.\n\nWhat does this mean for the Brexit talks?\n\nIt appears Mr Johnson's 'final offer' on Brexit - which he only submitted to the EU last Wednesday - is now officially dead with the bloc of the view that the PM's blueprint cannot act as the basis for a formal divorce agreement.\n\nWith just 23 days until the October 31 deadline that means the chances of a disorderly split from the bloc have gone up significantly.\n\nDowning Street is not willing to compromise any further and the EU does not believe Mr Johnson's ideas on how to delete the backstop are workable.\n\nIt is therefore hard, if not impossible, to see how the two sides could arrive at a deal within the next three weeks.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nMr Johnson will prorogue Parliament his evening as he prepares to set out his new domestic legislative agenda in a Queen's Speech next Monday.\n\nEnding the Parliamentary session today means that the PM will not face difficult Brexit questions in the Commons for the rest of this week.\n\nThat will in theory allow him to focus all of his energies on Brexit. Brussels had suggested the end of this week would be the moment when the two sides would know whether an agreement could be struck before a crunch EU summit on October 17.\n\nIf there is no agreement by close of play on Friday then the bloc's attentions will then switch to whether to offer the UK a Brexit delay.\n\nHowever, given the acrimony today following the PM's call with Ms Merkel, it looks likely that both sides already know that they will not agree a deal.\n\nThe effective collapse of the talks has prompted rumours that Mr Johnson could make a statement in Downing Street setting out his proposed next steps but nothing has been confirmed.\n\nWhy is this EU summit so important?\n\nThe scheduled European Council meeting in Brussels on October 17-18 is the last one due to take place before the Halloween Brexit deadline.\n\nIt had been earmarked as the last moment at which a deal could be agreed between Britain and the bloc.\n\nBut the chances of an accord being signed off at the summit now appear minuscule.\n\nIt is likely that instead of focusing on a deal the summit will now focus on whether a Brexit delay will be offered to the UK.\n\nIf a deal is off the table in the run up to the summit it is possible that Mr Johnson could choose to boycott the get together entirely.\n\nIf the PM's deal is dead, does that mean there will be a No Deal Brexit?\n\nIt is hard to answer this question definitively for a number of reasons.\n\nMPs have passed an anti-No Deal law - the so-called Benn Act - which will force the PM to ask Brussels to push back the Brexit date to January 31 next year if no agreement has been made by October 19.\n\nAssuming the EU agrees to such an extension then a No Deal Brexit will be avoided.\n\nBut the PM and the government remains adamant that the UK will leave the bloc with or without a deal on October 31.\n\nNumber 10 has conceded that it will have to comply with the Benn Act and ask for a delay.\n\nBoris Johnson and Angela Merkel, pictured in Berlin in September, today had a fiery phone call in which the German Chancellor reportedly told the PM Northern Ireland would need to stay in the EU customs union for a Brexit deal to be agreed\n\nBut Downing Street has also said it intends to make clear in public and private to the EU that the government does not actually want an extension in the hope that Brussels will refuse to offer one.\n\nSo it is possible that the government will ask the EU for a delay (as required by the law) while also telling the bloc not to grant one.\n\nIn those circumstances the UK's Brexit fate will rest entirely in the hands of the EU. If the bloc was to rule out an extension then the UK would leave without an agreement on Halloween.\n\nWhat is Boris Johnson's five-point plan to scrap the Irish backstop? Single market Northern Ireland would leave the Customs' Union with the rest of the UK but stay in the single market. This would constitute an 'all island regulatory zone' that covers trade of all goods. It would mean no checks between the two nations, because Northern Ireland would still have to follow EU rules. Goods from Britain to Northern Ireland would effectively be managed by a border in the Irish Sea, with checks only in that direction, not the reverse. Stormont Lock The 'all island regulatory zone' will have to be approved by the people of Northern Ireland. This means the Northern Ireland Assembly has the right to veto the zone and could hold a referendum on the matter. Customs checks Customs checks would have to be put in place on trade between Northern and the Republic of Ireland. Most checks would be made using technology, but some would still have to be physical. Cash for Northern Ireland A promise of a 'new deal for Northern Ireland' means ministers putting money aside for Belfast and Dublin to help aide economic development and ensure new measures work. Keeping to the Good Friday agreement Freedom of movement between two countries will remain. New deal would confirm commitment to collobaration between UK and Ireland.\n\nIf the EU does offer an extension the PM will be legally obliged to accept it. It could get very messy indeed.\n\nIf the EU agrees to an extension will there then be a general election?\n\nYes, almost certainly. Opposition leaders including Jeremy Corbyn have said that they will agree to an early election if and when a No Deal Brexit has been ruled out.\n\nIf the EU offer a delay at the summit then MPs could vote the next week to trigger a snap poll.\n\nThere are two mechanisms for holding an early election. The first is for the PM to be defeated on a confidence motion, and two weeks to pass without another confidence vote being won.\n\nThe second - and more likely route \u2013 is to have two-thirds of the Commons vote for an early election. If that motion was passed on October 22, the campaign legally has to be at least 25 working days later.\n\nElections are traditionally held on a Thursday. That gives a potential date of November 28.\n\nCould there still be a second referendum?\n\nA general election looks more likely but there are plenty of MPs who want a second referendum instead.\n\nFormer Tory Sir Oliver Letwin has warned that an election would not be a satisfactory way of settling the Brexit debate, as it would be clouded by a host of other political issues.\n\nSome senior Labour figures are also sympathetic to such concerns.\n\nThe route to a referendum would probably involve defeating Mr Johnson in a confidence vote, and then replacing him with a \u2018unity\u2019 candidate as PM such as Labour\u2019s Margaret Beckett or ex-chancellor Ken Clarke. They would then push through the legislation for a referendum.\n\nHowever, it looks like a very tricky proposition, with estimates that it could take up to six months to prepare a national ballot. There are also major questions about what the question would be, and whether No Deal would be on the ballot paper.\n\nWhat happens if Boris Johnson wins a majority at the early election?\n\nDowning Street has made clear that the PM is now planning to fight an election on a No Deal platform, as the EU will not compromise.\n\nThe pledge to make a 'clean break' is designed to absorb the votes that have flowed from the Tories, and indeed Labour in its northern heartlands, to the Brexit Party.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader pictured in London earlier this month, has said he will support an early general election if and when a No Deal Brexit has been ruled out\n\nVictory could require a fundamental realignment of the country\u2019s traditional political dividing lines, with the Conservatives needing seats like Bolsover \u2013 stronghold of hard-left veteran Dennis Skinner.\n\nWith a majority and a new mandate, Mr Johnson could then take the UK out of the EU without a deal \u2013 or have more leverage to extract concessions from Brussels.\n\nWhat happens if Jeremy Corbyn wins a majority at the early election?\n\nOn current polling, Labour looks unlikely to secure a majority by itself. But the SNP has signalled it could prop him up, in return for permission to hold a new independence referendum.\n\nLabour has vowed to renegotiate the existing Brexit deal and go into an election promising to hold a second Brexit referendum between a new divorce package and Remain.\n\nWhat if there is another hung Parliament?\n\nWith the polls highly volatile, it looks quite possible that an election could deliver broadly similar numbers to the current Parliament.\n\nThis would be possibly the most disconcerting outcome for the country \u2013 sending politicians straight back to the drawing board to try and final a way to break the deadlock.", "description": "Boris Johnson's hopes of striking a new Brexit deal with the EU were dashed this morning after a furious early morning phone call with Angela Merkel.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline", "James Tapsfield", "Mailonline Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19448572-0-image-a-51_1570549727770.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
