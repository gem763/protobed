And Rex looks a bit guilty to me??\u2019 the former Eastenders star wrote, as his wide-eyed son gasped at the accusation.\n\nWith that butter-wouldn\u2019t-melt look, we\u2019re not convinced the infant would do such a thing\u2026\n\nBecoming a father for the second time hasn\u2019t been the easiest ride for Joe, who has a 12-year-old son with former fiance Emma Sophocleus, with Stacey revealing that Rex\u2019s birth has brought up a lot of trauma for the dad surrounding the loss of his own father.\n\n\u2018It is a trauma and I am always surprised that people are surprised that you grieve forever,\u2019 30-year-old Stacey said on Loose Women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Joe lost his dad when he was 11 and it has had a fundamental impact on his life, especially when huge life events happen \u2013 even if they are positive.\n\n\u2018When we had Rex, [there] was trauma. At the same time as being the most wonderful thing in the world.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018He never got to show his dad his son, and he\u2019ll never get that chance and he thought about that a lot. It really impacted, and I think still impacts, his life.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
