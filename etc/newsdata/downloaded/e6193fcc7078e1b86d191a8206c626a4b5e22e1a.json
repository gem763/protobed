REUTERS/Stringer\n\nBut events in the states of Sinaloa, Michoacan and Guerrero this past week, including two mass killings and an all-out gun battle on Thursday that saw security forces overwhelmed by cartel gunmen, have raised questions about the effectiveness of his new security strategy.\n\n(Graphic: Bungled arrest of kingpin's son, click here)\n\nWHAT HAPPENED IN MEXICO THIS PAST WEEK?\n\nOn Monday, cartel hitmen shot dead at least 13 police in an ambush in Aguililla in the western state of Michoacan, long convulsed by turf wars between drug gangs, latterly the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and its enemies.\n\nThe following day, a gunfight left 14 civilians and one soldier dead in Tepochica, near Iguala, a city notorious for the 2014 disappearances of 43 student teachers. Tuesday\u2019s mass killing in Guerrero raised questions about whether the armed forces used excessive force, reviving the specter of past executions.\n\nThen came the bungled arrest on Thursday of the son of jailed kingpin Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman that turned the streets of Culiacan in Sinaloa into a scene of nightmarish urban warfare.\n\nCartel gunmen surrounded security forces in the northwestern city and made them free Ovidio Guzman after his brief capture.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THIS NEW SECURITY STRATEGY?\n\nVeteran leftist Lopez Obrador\u2019s new strategy for battling crime focuses on addressing the root causes of violence, in particular reducing poverty, stamping out entrenched corruption, and giving young adults job opportunities.\n\nHe has boosted wages along the U.S.-Mexico border, created thousands of apprenticeships, and is promoting investments in the impoverished south.\n\nHe says he believes in the inherent good of all Mexicans, and says \u201cyou can\u2019t fight fire with fire,\u201d and \u201chugs not bullets.\u201d\n\nAs well as his emphasis on combating the social ills that spark violence, he has created a new National Guard force that replaces the federal police and has absorbed thousands of soldiers.\n\nIS IT WORKING?\n\nNot so far. Homicides in 2019 are on track to surpass last year\u2019s record.\n\nAnalysts warn the government has not clearly explained how it will use the National Guard to outsmart the cartels. With no clear short term strategy, there is a sense on the ground that this government is less tough on gangs, said Falko Ernst, Mexico analyst with the International Crisis Group, who has done extensive fieldwork in crime-wracked states.\n\n\u201cThe inertia and lack of definition of a security strategy by the government has allowed regional armed conflicts to spin out of control,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cCriminal group members and commanders have told me in Michoacan and in Guerrero that this (inertia) has meant a looser leash.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, many of the National Guard have been rerouted to deal with a wave of illegal migration through Mexico at the behest of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nWHEN DID THIS START?\n\nLopez Obrador regularly heaps blame on previous governments for the delicate security situation in Mexico.\n\nMexico\u2019s \u2018War on Drugs\u2019 started in 2006 with former President Felipe Calderon, who sent in armed forces to tackle the increasingly powerful drug cartels, which had shifted gears from smuggling cocaine for the Colombian cartels to becoming full narcotrafficking operations themselves. Since then, more than 200,000 people have been killed in gang-fueled violence and over 40,000 are missing.\n\nThe crackdown led to the splintering of Mexico\u2019s cartels and some notable wins for the government, including the arrest of \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman. He escaped twice from jail in Mexico before being extradited to the United States, where he was found guilty in February of smuggling drugs and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nThe U.S. government says that under Guzman\u2019s leadership, the Sinaloa cartel imported and distributed tons of cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine and heroin in the United States over more than two decades.\n\nDIDN\u2019T JAILING EL CHAPO PUT AN END TO THE VIOLENCE?\n\nThe extradition of Guzman was a double-edged sword.\n\nIt \u201cappears to have led to violent competition from a competing cartel, the CJNG,\u201d according to an August report prepared by the U.S. Congressional Research Service. The CJNG had split from Sinaloa in 2010 and is considered by many analysts to now be the most dangerous and largest Mexican cartel.\n\nPhotos of Monday\u2019s police ambush published on social media showed shot-up and burning police vehicles, as well as the slain officers. They also showed large placards signed \u201cCJNG,\u201d left on police vehicles, which warned police not to support rival crime groups, including Michoacan-based Los Viagras.\n\nAnd even after Guzman was locked away for life in a Colorado prison known as \u201cthe Alcatraz of the Rockies,\u201d the cartel he founded has flourished.\n\nThe Sinaloa cartel \u201chas fought brutally for increased control of routes through the border states of Chihuahua and Baja California, with the goal of remaining the dominant drug trafficking organization,\u201d the Congressional Research Service report said.\n\nThe cartel\u2019s decentralized structure had allowed it to adapt, the report added.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nWithin this decentralized structure, Ovidio Guzman, one of \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman\u2019s at least 12 children, appears to have taken an active role. The U.S. Department of Justice unveiled an indictment against Ovidio and one of his brothers in February, charging them with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana in the United States.\n\nSecurity analyst Gladys McCormick at Syracuse University in the United States said Thursday\u2019s apparent capitulation to the Sinaloa Cartel was \u201csending a loud message to other organized crime networks... that if they show up with enough firepower to a fight, they will win and get their way because the government does not have the wherewithal to fight back.\u201d", "description": "Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in December, promising not to repeat the \"failed policies\" of past administrations that have done little to stem a tide of drug-related violence that cost some 29,000 lives last year.", "authors": ["Anthony Esposito", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442496685&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H269", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
