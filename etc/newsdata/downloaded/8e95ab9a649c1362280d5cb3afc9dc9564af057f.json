But the new dorms still weren\u2019t very nice. \u201cIf someone today were to go back in time, they would find the dormitories very spartan, even at the prestigious colleges,\u201d Thelin said. It was typical for these \u201clean and ascetic\u201d accommodations to have two or three students to a bedroom and to have communal bathrooms and showers shared by 20 or 30 students. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any place that thought in terms of student comfort,\u201d he said. \u201cAt most, they would add a common study area, or a house library, or something like that.\u201d\n\nRead: Has college gotten too easy?\n\nIn the mid-\u201980s, a confluence of factors led colleges to compete more intensely for enrollees, and they began orienting themselves more toward the desires of students. \u201cYou have upper-middle-class families visiting a campus, and parents are saying, \u2018My goodness, we\u2019re paying this amount of money for tuition for our son or daughter, and they\u2019re living in this nondescript place,\u2019 [one] that may not be well maintained,\u201d Thelin said.\n\nThe rationale for building fancier dorms and rolling out plush amenities is that doing so might entice prospective students\u2014especially those who can afford to pay full tuition\u2014in a competitive higher-education market. But it\u2019s not clear that this reliably pays off. Kevin McClure, a professor of higher education at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, calls this the \u201cIf you build it, will they come?\u201d question. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there is that much in the way of empirical evidence that directly says, \u2018By building new facilities, you necessarily attract more students,\u2019\u201d he told me. Arriving at such a determination, he said, would require clearly defining what counts as luxurious (granite countertops? nickel finishes?) and data that track the presence of those features in the nation\u2019s dorms. Neither a straightforward definition nor such a specific data set exists.\n\nThere is some evidence that prospective students discriminate between schools based on how nice their campuses are. The authors of a 2015 study looking at colleges\u2019 spending found that \u201cmany students do appear to value college consumption amenities,\u201d and in particular that wealthier students seemed to be \u201cmuch more willing to pay for consumption amenities.\u201d However, McClure said, there aren\u2019t conclusive\u2014or granular enough\u2014data pointing to a causal link between building fancy dorms and achieving enrollment goals.\n\nBesides, he articulated a bunch of reasons colleges build new dorms that don\u2019t have to do with wooing amenity-hungry students: Some schools need to accommodate growing student bodies. Some are trying to transition from commuter campuses to residential campuses. Some conclude that having students live on campus will increase retention and improve academic outcomes, so they may require, say, first-year students to do so\u2014which means increasing the number of beds.", "description": "Many of today\u2019s students are living in far better-appointed accommodations than now-graying alumni did.", "authors": ["Joe Pinsker"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/GettyImages_682091140/facebook.jpg?1567088634"}
