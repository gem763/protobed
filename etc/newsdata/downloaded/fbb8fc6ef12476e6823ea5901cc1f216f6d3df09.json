Sydneysiders and Melbournites won\u2019t even wait for the \u2018ane\u2019 after hearing \u2018Brisb\u2019 to launch into some sort of patronising diatribe about how much the beautiful city of Brisbane sucks. And that\u2019s fine. They can say it sucks as much they like because a) it rules here and their opinion doesn\u2019t matter and b) it\u2019s a little bit true. The normal response to hearing someone trash-talk to your home city, obviously, is to completely ignore it. This is not the course taken by at least one Adelaidian (Adelaidite?), whose complaint(s) forced SBS presenter Lucy Zeli\u0107 to apologise for calling the city a \u201cshithole\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on the The World Game podcast yesterday, Zeli\u0107 told Central Coast Mariners recruit Ziggy Gordon that there wasn\u2019t much to be enthusiastic about in the South Australia capital: \u201cYou won\u2019t see much in Adelaide, Adelaide\u2019s a shithole. No disrespect, no disrespect \u2014 I can say that because I\u2019ve travelled there multiple times and I didn\u2019t enjoy it. I found it to be incredibly dull and boring.\u201d\n\nWhether or not the claim had any truth to it, Zeli\u0107 apparently felt compelled to withdraw the comment, taking to Twitter to apologise:\n\nYesterday I made an off-handed comment about Adelaide on The World Game LIVE. I recognise these comments weren\u2019t okay and I\u2019m truly sorry for what I said. \u2014 Lucy Zeli\u0107 (@LucyZelic) September 24, 2019\n\nHopefully the people hurt by these comments can console themselves by looking at a church or whatever it is people in Adelaide do.", "description": "SBS presenter Lucy Zeli\u0107 has apologised for (maybe rightfully) calling Adelaide a boring shithole on an episode of The World Game LIVE.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-465334228.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
