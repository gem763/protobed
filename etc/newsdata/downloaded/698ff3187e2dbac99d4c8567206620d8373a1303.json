Some analysts attribute the killings to armed groups looking to gain territorial authority and the control of the illegal drugs trade. Those candidates who support the implementation of the peace process, including the eradication or substitution of coca crops, risk becoming targets.\n\nAmid the rising tide of violence, national women\u2019s organisations are voicing concerns that attacks on female political candidates are shaped by gender dynamics.\n\nCarolina Mosquera, researcher at feminist organisation Sisma Mujer, said women are being targeted both for running as candidates, and for disturbing the patriarchal order. \u201cMale candidates are being attacked, but not for gendered reasons \u2013 not because they are men.\u201d\n\nIrina Cuesta, a researcher at thinktank Fundaci\u00f3n Ideas para la Paz, told the Guardian: \u201cOur research has found that when women leaders are attacked, it\u2019s through threats to their family members, sexual violence, and generalised warnings against the work they do. The contents of the threats are openly sexist and question [women\u2019s] political processes more generally.\u201d\n\nShe describes a wave of femicides that took place in Puerto As\u00eds, Putumayo, earlier this year. Among victims were women who planned to register as candidates in the coming elections.\n\n\u201cThere is a political message behind these aggressions against women leaders and candidates, particularly in the territories where stereotypes and tolerance to gender-based violence are useful tools for illegal armed actors.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The remains of the armoured car in which mayoral candidate Karina Garc\u00eda and five others were shot and killed, in a rural area of Suarez, Cauca department.

The second time they came to me, it was much more vulgar, crueller,\u201d she says, in her campaign office in the centre of Tumaco.\n\n\u201cThey threatened me and told me that they know where my daughter is, where my husband is, that they know where we travel and how we move, and if something happened, it would be my fault.\u201d\n\nShe and her team decided to pull out of the running, but later surprised the community by officially registering again.\n\n\u201cWomen need to keep advancing to get access to the spaces that we still can\u2019t reach. There should be an equality when it comes to governing this country, there should be more women counsellors, representatives, governors, mayors.\u201d\n\nShe has hired private security, but remains fearful.\n\n\u201cWhen you launch a political campaign, you put your life at risk, your family at risk,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI feel that there are no guarantees for my safety. I want to do my job, but there are stronger interests out there.\u201d\n\nTen years ago, Laura Montoya nearly died after being attacked by a paramilitary group while in the office of her radio station. A journalist and activist for many years, she is now running for a seat in the departmental assembly of Putumayo, a southern province bordering Ecuador and Peru.\n\nIn 2018, Montoya received a death threat via an anonymous phone call, and earlier this year her name appeared on a menacing pamphlet signed by a paramilitary group. Despite ongoing fears for her safety, she decided to launch a political campaign.\n\n\u201cWomen are gaining ground, but we still have further to go, and this has to begin from above, with policies that can represent real changes,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThere is a gendered issue here. There is a deep-rooted machismo. I work alongside men who are involved in the same activism and they haven\u2019t received the threats that I have.\u201d\n\nHer department, Putumayo, continues to be one of the top coca-growing parts of the country, and armed groups are once again trying to gain control of the illicit trade.\n\nWhen it comes to women running for office in this context, Montoya is clear: \u201cWomen have become more empowered, but [participation] is still lacking because of the fear, the lack of guarantees for their security.\u201d\n\nAccording to 2011 law, each party\u2019s electoral list must include 30% women. Despite this, only 12% of all mayors in the country are women.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People gather in Suarez to honour mayoral candidate Karina Garc\u00eda.

The level of murders and extreme violence we have seen in Colombia is very worrying and requires a strengthened response from all of the institutions. It\u2019s the community leaders who face the biggest risks of threats and violence, which is why it\u2019s extremely important that what we saw happen in Cauca mobilises everyone to respond, investigate and sanction what happened.\u201d\n\nDuring her campaign, Karina Garc\u00eda\u2019s political slogan was: \u201cOne woman, one hope\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to bring a new sort of leadership to Su\u00e1rez [her municipality],\u201d says Mosquera, \u201cbut when so few women are willing to risk entering electoral politics and then they see events like this, the message becomes extremely clear: don\u2019t participate or this could happen to you too.\u201d", "description": "Killing of Karina Garc\u00eda reflects targeting of female contenders, amid mounting security concerns", "authors": ["Julia Zulver In Putumayo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f110543f3253eed2f8a7e8b6cc76d06437920040/0_0_2738_1643/master/2738.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=17a23fc3a55686b92cce15f736d784e5", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
