She quickly gathers a bright red rope from under a nearby desk and flings it out the window.\n\nA second security video, recorded from what appears to be a street-level parking garage, shows the red rope dangling from above. Eventually, Merlano drops to the ground. Passersby initially come to her aid, and she then can be seen hopping on the back of a motorbike; the driver hands her a helmet, and they both speed away.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, Interpol announced it was issuing an orange notice to the international law enforcement community warning that Merlano represented a serious and imminent threat to public safety.\n\nAuthorities confirmed Merlano\u2019s escape on Twitter on Tuesday and held a news conference to answer questions about how the former politician got away.\n\nEl @INPEC_Colombia se permite informar la fuga de la PPL Aida Merlano durante una cita m\u00e9dica odontol\u00f3gica en un centro m\u00e9dico del norte de la ciudad.

Justice Minister Margarita Cabello fired the women\u2019s prison head who authorized Merlano\u2019s dentist trip, reported Al Jazeera. Cabello also asked for the resignation of William Ruiz, who oversees Colombia\u2019s prison system. Eight additional prison staffers were suspended, according to Al Jazeera.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is an investigation underway for the mistake that may have occurred regarding the oversight of the mission, of taking her to the doctor\u2019s office and bringing her back to the women\u2019s prison,\u201d Ruiz said at a news conference.\n\nAD\n\nThe BBC reported that Merlano arrived at the Medical Center of La Sabana at 11:35 a.m. Tuesday, escorted by two female guards. A guard waited outside the room for three hours while Merlano saw the dentist. When the dentist left the room, the guard entered, only to find Merlano already gone, the BBC reported.\n\nIn a statement, the medical center said it was notified at 3 p.m. of Merlano\u2019s escape. The former politician has not been since the escape.\n\nAD\n\nMerlano, a former House representative in Colombia, won her Senate race last year but will not serve in the seat because of her criminal conviction. She was found guilty of buying people\u2019s votes and being in illegal possession of firearms, reported the local newspaper El Tiempo.\n\nRead more:\n\nFake-blood fail: Climate activists trying to spray a government building lost control of the hose\n\nToxic lead, scared parents and simmering anger: A month inside a city without clean water\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets are unstoppable, except when it comes to Nickelback\n\nAD", "description": "Aida Merlano, 43, has not been seen since, authorities said.", "authors": ["Katie Mettler", "Reporter Covering Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yS4048ZgtFlmuuZ-AMN2NmNHJSQ=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/5d9622804cedfd000941493a/2019-10-03T160953Z_1_OVAZJU0GV_RTRMADC_0_COLOMBIA-ESCAPE-ROUGH-CUT.jpg"}
