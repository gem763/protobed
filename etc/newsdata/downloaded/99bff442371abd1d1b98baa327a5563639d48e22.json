The point is, he looks like people.\n\n\u201cNori is a Toy Australian Shepard and Toy Poodle mix and he often looks like he\u2019s smiling,\u201d owner Kevin Hurless said.\n\n\u201cWe usually hear that it is his eyes that creates the human look, and I tend to agree.\u201d\n\nNori lives in Seattle with his parents Kevin Hurless, 33, and Tiffany Ngo, 34, where he has become quite the local celebrity for his gorgeous face. They\u2019ve even gone so far as to make him an Instagram account to keep his followers up to date with his life.\n\nHe has also gone viral on Twitter, thanks to a little help from the beloved WeRateDogs page that has changed my life.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m losing my mind over his big, almond-shaped eyes, pink lips and cute smile. This dog looks more like a human than some humans do.\n\nNori looks like that Snapchat face-swap filter IRL and I\u2019m living for it. Give this dog his own reality show. Give him the whole damn world.\n\n\u201cWhen he was a puppy, we couldn\u2019t go more than a block without someone stopping us to ask questions about him,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cIt has become less frequent as he\u2019s gotten older, but we still often hear about how human his face and eyes look.\u201d\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough to make you fall in love with this adorable pooch, he\u2019s also a friendly boy, according to his dog-parents Kevin and Tiffany.\n\n\u201cHe loves all people and dogs that he meets, and just wants to be friends with everyone.\u201d\n\nHE. JUST. WANTS. TO. BE. FRIENDS. WITH. EVERYONE.\n\nI cannot. I simply cannot with him. If anything bad ever happens to this dog I will need to take extended leave from work because I am deeply emotionally invested in him.\n\nGive him the keys to the city.
