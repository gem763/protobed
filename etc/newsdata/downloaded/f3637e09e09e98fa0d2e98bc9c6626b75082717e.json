Krishnamoorthi called the \u201cmystery illnesses\u201d and deaths shocking. Krishnamoorthi confirmed his committee has scheduled additional hearings to take place September 24 to investigate the outbreak, during which CDC principal deputy director, Anne Schuchat, will testify.\n\n\u2018They have very deep pockets\u2019\n\n\u201cI think that Congress has not acted fast enough. The administration has not acted fast enough, Krishnamoorthi said. \u201cThe e-cigarette industry is incredibly powerful. They have very deep pockets. They're spending a lot of money on lobbying, and now they have the power of Big Tobacco behind them...I think that the strength of Big Tobacco and the e-cigarette industry helps explain the slow action in Washington.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in December 2018 tobacco giant Altria (MO) acquired a 35% stake in JUUL for $12.8 billion. Juul is a key player in the e-cigarette business and sells pods with flavors like mint and mango.\n\nSignage for Juul vaping products is seen on a storefront in New York City, U.S., September 9, 2019. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly More\n\nThe Trump administration on Wednesday announced a forthcoming Food & Drug Administration (FDA) policy to end sales of non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes, and prioritize the agency\u2019s enforcement ability.\n\nJuul said in a statement: \"We strongly agree with the need for aggressive category-wide action on flavored products. We will fully comply with the final FDA policy when effective.\"\n\nThe move comes after Kansas state health officials confirmed a sixth U.S. death believed to be related to e-cigarette or vape product use, and after the FDA officially warned e-cigarette giant Juul on Monday that it violated law by marketing its products as safer alternatives to traditional cigarettes without FDA approval. The agency said it was particularly concerned because statements by Juul about lower risk levels were made directly to children in school.\n\nWhile federal agencies have been working to identify the link between use of the products and illness, so far the cause has alluded health experts. In addition to the reported deaths, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) last week issued a notice confirming 450 reported cases of lung illness possibly connected to e-cigarette use. Five other reported deaths, the agency said, occurred in California, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, and Oregon.\n\nMADRID, SPAIN - SEPTEMBER 06: A man vaping an e-cigarette on September 06, 2019 in Madrid, Spain.
