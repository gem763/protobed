Here's what they're discussing.", "language": "en", "text": "Presidential elections are decided by many things: media exposure, financial backing, personal chemistry, timing and luck. Policy positions often are just a way of signaling where a candidate stands on the political spectrum. But 2020 is shaping up to be different, the most ideas-driven election in recent American history. On the Democratic side, a robust debate about inequality has given rise to ambitious proposals to redress the imbalance in Americans\u2019 economic situations. Candidates are churning out positions on banking regulation, antitrust law and the future effects of artificial intelligence. The Green New Deal is spurring debate on the crucial issue of climate change, which could also play a role in a possible Republican challenge to Donald Trump.\n\nYahoo News will be examining these and other policy questions in \u201cThe Ideas Election\u201d \u2014 a series of articles on how candidates are defining and addressing the most important issues facing the United States as it prepares to enter a new decade.\n\nThe United States, the richest country in the world, also incarcerates more people than any other nation, almost 2.2 million as of the end of 2016. But the criminal justice system touches many more people than the number actually behind bars at any one time. According to the Prison Policy Initiative, \u201cover 600,000 people enter prison gates, but people go to jail 10.6 million times\u201d annually, and nearly half a million people are \u201clocked up on nonviolent drug offenses on any given day.\u201d\n\nAnd the effect of a prison sentence can last a lifetime.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Daryl Atkinson began a 10-year prison sentence at the Alabama Department of Corrections for drug trafficking. \u201cWhen I was released from incarceration, that was only the beginning of the punishment,\u201d Atkinson, who served a mandatory minimum of 40 months on his sentence, told Yahoo News in an interview. \u201cMy driver\u2019s license was automatically suspended because of my drug crime. I was denied federal financial student aid because of my drug crime. I was given an over $60,000 civil fine that I still have to pay back because of my drug crime. I couldn\u2019t and still can\u2019t vote in the state of Alabama because of my drug crime. I was denied admittance to several undergraduate schools and law schools because of my drug crime.\u201d\n\nThese \u201ccollateral consequences,\u201d as Atkinson referred to them, make it difficult to reenter society and more likely that an ex-convict will return to crime.\n\n\u201cFortunate enough for me, I returned home to a loving family that could provide me food, clothing and shelter,\u201d said Atkinson, now the executive director of Forward Justice, a law and policy advocacy group dedicated to civil rights, racial justice, and social and economic change.\n\n\u201cI went into prison with a high school diploma. I came out with a high school diploma. But I had that stability as far as a family system to return to. I was able to work out a plan. And I went back and I got my associate\u2019s degree, bachelor\u2019s degree and a law degree.\u201d\n\nBut many former prisoners aren\u2019t so lucky.\n\nPublic and political discourse on criminal justice has shifted dramatically in recent decades across the political spectrum.\n\nThe Constitution established protections for individuals in their interaction with three elements of the criminal justice system: law enforcement, courts and corrections. The Fourth through Eighth amendments established procedures for arrests, grand jury indictments, arraignments and trial.\n\nThey remain the basis of a criminal justice system that many nations have sought to copy, and remain, in principle, as fair as any in the world.\n\nBut the system was not always fair to the disadvantaged or oppressed. It wasn\u2019t until 1963, in Gideon v. Wainwright, that the U.S. Supreme Court would rule that states under the Sixth Amendment were required to provide an attorney to defendants in criminal cases who are unable to afford their own attorneys.\n\nThen, amid rising crime, a drug epidemic and fears about public safety in the 1980s, changes in the law led to more pretrial detention for suspects, mandatory minimum sentences, an increase in the use of solitary confinement to punish and control inmates \u2014 and an explosion of prison populations.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images; digitally enhanced by Yahoo News More\n\nThe Bail Reform Act of 1984 changed the practice, mandated by Congress in 1966, of releasing suspects on their own recognizance if their appearance for trial was assured. It allowed a judge in a federal court to detain suspects as potential flight risks or if considered a serious threat to public safety. Many states followed suit, adopting similar statutes. In 2016, 450,000 people were locked up without a conviction or sentencing, according to the Prison Policy Initiative.\n\nBy the time the crack epidemic began to ravage African-American communities, \u201claw and order\u201d had become a popular rhetoric among conservative politicians. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201ctough on crime\u201d stance merged with the \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d resulting in harsh penalties for drug offenses.\n\n\u201cWhen Reagan took office in 1980, the total prison population was 329,000, and when he left office eight years later, the prison population had essentially doubled, to 627,000. This staggering rise in incarceration hit communities of color the hardest,\u201d the Brennan Center for Justice points out.\n\nBut Republicans weren\u2019t alone in their crusade against crime. Democrats, afraid of being labeled \u201csoft on crime,\u201d also supported legislation such as the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which was signed by Reagan and introduced mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses.\n\nInfamously, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a bipartisan crime bill that then-Sen. Joe BIden helped write, stiffened penalties for drug crimes, especially those involving crack cocaine. The law has been blamed for putting hundreds of thousands of black men in prison. It wouldn't be until after 2010, when Barack Obama's administration passed the Fair Sentencing Act to reduce the disparity in sentences between crack (most prevalent in minority communities) and powder cocaine (more commonly used by whites), that the number of federal prosecutions of offenders decreased by half.\n\nBut even before America elected its first black president, public attitudes toward crime and punishment had begun to change. \u201cIncreasingly, Republicans are talking about helping ex-prisoners find housing, drug treatment, mental-health counseling, job training and education,\u201d reported the New York Times in 2006.\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s incarceration rate peaked at 1,000 inmates per 100,000 adults during the three-year period between 2006 and 2008,\u201d according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nIn his final year in office, President George W. Bush signed the Second Chance Act, allocating $362 million to prisons for various reentry programs, to \u201chelp give prisoners across America a second chance for a better life,\u201d he said before the signing.\n\nPresident George W. Bush signs the Second Chance Act in 2008.

It aims to reduce recidivism, shorten mandatory minimum sentences for some drug offenses, and support people currently in the criminal justice system. Over 3,100 people were released from federal prison as parts of the First Step Act went into effect. But the law benefits only a fraction of imprisoned people, since most of them aren\u2019t held in federal prisons, where nearly half of all inmates are locked up for drug charges, but held in state prisons and local jails. Additionally, those convicted of violent crimes and abortion-related offenses are ineligible for early release programs under the law, along with 11,000 prisoners convicted of violating immigration laws.\n\nThe past few years have seen additional progress for reform advocates, including the election of progressive prosecutors, an overhaul of cash bail for suspects awaiting trial and voting rights restoration to ex-felons. The prison population has been steadily, if slowly, declining from its peak in 2009, according to a recent Bureau of Justice Statistics report. And the disparity between African-Americans and whites in prison is shrinking.\n\nDemocratic candidates are now capitalizing on the rare bipartisan support on Capitol HIll and in the White House to propose major structural reform to the U.S. criminal justice system.\n\nDemocratic contenders, who along with Trump head to South Carolina this weekend for a criminal justice forum at the historically black Benedict College, have been touting ambitious plans that aim to end laws and practices that they say contribute to mass incarceration and threaten public safety.\n\nIn recent months, they have proposed big ideas \u2014 releasing prisoners who\u2019ve faced harsh sentencing, decriminalizing or legalizing marijuana, banning for-profit prisons and improving police-community relations, eliminating solitary confinement and capital punishment, ending money bail and mandatory minimum sentences, and restoring rights, including voting, to released inmates.\n\nThe leading progressives in the race unveiled comprehensive criminal justice proposals at about the same time in August. Bernie Sanders\u2019s plan includes all of the above points and an overall rethinking of criminal justice. His plan approaches disparities in the criminal justice system by addressing underlying societal issues that contribute to crime such as mental illness, addiction, underfunded schools, homelessness or poverty.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders speaks to supporters during a campaign rally.

That means implementing a set of bold, structural changes at all levels of government.\u201d\n\nWarren called for increased law enforcement oversight, improved resources for public defenders and holding prosecutors accountable for abuses, all elements Sanders addresses. She also called for repealing the 1994 crime bill.\n\nBiden has also unveiled a plan to remedy the negative impacts of the bill he helped pass, as a part of his decarceration initiative, which includes ending cash bail and addressing racial disparities in education spending, policing and sentencing.\n\nAs a senator, Cory Booker has championed criminal justice reform and has a long history of crafting and supporting bills that aim to reverse mass incarceration.\n\nEarlier this year, he introduced a Senate version of the Second Look Act of 2019, building on Trump\u2019s First Step Act to give more federal prisoners a chance at early release. The legislation would allow federal judges to consider petitions for sentence reduction after a person has served at least 10 years and is considered not to be a danger to public safety, regardless of the crime.\n\nBooker has also proposed using the president\u2019s clemency power to bypass Congress and provide early release to as many as tens of thousands of federal inmates serving excessive sentences.\n\nHis aggressive proposals call for scaling back mass incarceration, ending the war on drugs and, similar to Sanders, reinstating the right for formerly incarcerated individuals to vote in federal elections. Booker\u2019s stance on criminal justice reform has helped overcome doubts about his record as mayor of Newark, N.J., when he supported police \u201cstop and frisk\u201d tactics that targeted African-Americans.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris at a campaign stop in Des Moines, Iowa. (Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images; digitally enhanced by Yahoo News) More\n\nThe same hasn\u2019t been said for Sen. Kamala Harris, whose record as California\u2019s top cop continues to bring her under scrutiny from the progressive Democratic base.\n\nHarris, the self-proclaimed \u201cprogressive prosecutor,\u201d \u201cpushed for higher cash bails for certain crimes in 2004 as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, declined to support marijuana legalization in 2010 and, as California\u2019s attorney general, refused to back independent investigations for police shootings as recently as 2014,\u201d said the New York Times.\n\nBut as the Times reported, she backs a plan to \u201cfundamentally transform our criminal justice system.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was swimming against the current, and thankfully the currents have changed,\u201d she told the Times in defense of her new public stance on criminal justice reform. \u201cThe winds are in our sails. And I\u2019m riding that just like everybody else is \u2014 because it\u2019s long overdue.\u201d\n\nThe plan, which was crafted with the help of racial and social justice advocates, including black progressives who have criticized her record, mirrors the plans of Booker, Sanders and Warren in that it centers around disrupting a system that profits from a prison population, tackles social issues that lead to incarceration and ensures prisoners are treated humanely during and after their time served. But her plan also aims to create a national police systems review board and establish a National Criminal Justice Commission to study criminal justice systems and provide recommendations on major structural reforms.\n\nWhile there was a point when Democrats were hesitant to rally against the criminal justice system in fear of being considered \u201csoft on crime,\u201d today\u2019s political climate has a platform for ideas promoting big, structural reform.\n\nIncreasingly, research has unearthed inequities embedded in how America addresses issues of crime and punishment. Public opinion has followed. Polls have found that a majority of Americans, around 91 percent in 2017, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, support criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cThe conversation today is unrecognizable from where it was just 10 years ago, let alone 30,\u201d Adam Gelb, president of the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan research organization, told Yahoo News. \u201cWhat we have now is candidates competing to see who can be the most aggressively progressive, rather than who can thump their chest the loudest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere used to be almost an article of faith that to drive crime down, prisons had to go up,\u201d he continued, \u201cand starting about 10 years ago now, people started to see that it was possible to reduce crime and imprisonment at the same time.\u201d\n\nStill, Gelb pointed out that crime is not a priority issue among voters.\n\n\u201cCrime isn\u2019t the dominant issue that it was in the early \u201990s, and so there\u2019s a lot less pressure on political leaders to offer headline-grabbing solutions,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s not a top tier issue for the general public, but it is a top priority for a very vocal group of activists in the [Democratic] Party.\u201d\n\nTherefore, \u201cthe thrust of most of the proposals is to undo what are viewed as many of the excesses of criminal justice policy over the past quarter century,\u201d said Gelb. The far-reaching plans that focus on underlying issues like improving health care and education could have an effect on crime and incarceration rates, he acknowledged, but only over the long term, while \u201cstrategies in policing, pretrial detention and sentencing and reentry can have substantial impact now. We can\u2019t overlook those in favor of longer-term societal restructuring.\u201d\n\nBut as a formerly incarcerated American, Atkinson believes the best approach to fixing the criminal justice system is a \u201cvery holistic\u201d one.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice reform has in some ways become en vogue,\u201d he said, challenging \u201cDemocrats who want to curry people\u2019s vote and particularly communities of color\u201d to consider all the ways in which millions of Americans interact with the criminal justice system before they put forth \u201cpolicy prescriptions.\u201d\n\nA rally outside the U.S. Capitol in support of criminal justice reform . (Photo: Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images; digitally enhanced by Yahoo News) More\n\n\u201cThe 2.2 million people who are in a cage, the other 5 million folks that are on probation or parole and the over 70 million Americans in this country \u2014 one in three adults that have a criminal record or a criminal background in some kind of database \u2014 all of these people have families, many of them are voters, many of them are actively civically engaged. And as a result, candidates need to be responsive to that constituent base,\u201d Atkinson said.\n\nMichael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, told Yahoo News that across the board politically, approaches to criminal justice have changed not only \u201cbecause crime is down, the public doesn\u2019t feel like everybody needs to run for sheriff anymore,\u201d but also in part due to race.\n\n\u201cAfrican-Americans are a key constituency,\u201d Tanner told Yahoo News. \u201cAnd one way to appeal to that constituency has been on the criminal justice reform issue, so you\u2019re seeing even Kamala Harris, who was as strict a prosecutor as you could ever find in California, now suddenly championing criminal justice reform issues.\u201d\n\nConsidering that African-Americans make up about 12 percent of the U.S. population but 33 percent of the federal and state prison population, according to the Pew Research Center, proposals from Democratic candidates demonstrate the party\u2019s commitment to black voters.\n\nAs for Republicans, Tanner argues that on a state level, GOP governors like Rick Perry of Texas championed criminal justice issues in part because of cost.\n\n\u201cPrisons are expensive,\u201d he said, adding that Republican leaders may have seen criminal justice reform \u201cas a way to reach out to minority constituencies that didn\u2019t involve money.\u201d\n\nTanner added: \u201cThen there\u2019s just a reaction generally to government overreach. If you\u2019re kind of against big government and you don\u2019t trust the government, the criminal justice system is an obvious target.\u201d\n\nAs with many policy proposals by Democratic candidates, criminal justice reform platforms are aspirational, and the next president will be limited in what he or she can accomplish. Most criminal justice issues are at the state or local level, and any changes to the law have to go through Congress.\n\n\u201cNot only do these candidates need to get elected, but Congress also has to break down in the right way so that they can get a veto-proof majority, which is essentially what they\u2019re likely going to need to sort of push some of the proposals,\u201d said Rafael Mangual, a fellow and deputy director of legal policy at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research and a proponent for prioritizing public safety within criminal justice reform. \u201cWhile federal reforms may help move the needle a bit at the margins, the reality is that criminal justice is and always will be a state-based endeavor. The vast majority of prisoners are held at the state level, where the vast majority of enforcement happens.\u201d\n\nInmates in a classroom at the Orange County jail in Santa Ana, Calif., in 2011. (Photo: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters; digitally enhanced by Yahoo News) More\n\nMangual perceives the leftward shift in the debate around the criminal justice system as a result of a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d that \u201cbasically states that the U.S. can actually be described as a draconian carceral state in which millions of people are wrongfully in prison for low-level and nonviolent offenses for long stretches of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou start to feel invincible the further removed from a crime epidemic that you get,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes some of the lessons that were learned in fighting that crime get lost.\u201d\n\nMangual expressed concerns that vulnerable, low-income minority communities will face increased crime in light of ambitious decarceration plans, not communities made up of white, high-income citizens. He advises that candidates approach their reform proposals with caution to make sure \u201cwe\u2019re doing things incrementally so that we get it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause real people are going to have to pay the price for these things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that price is not going to be borne equally by people across the country. It is going to be disproportionately borne by people living in communities that are already vulnerable and likely already suffering from violent crime problems.\u201d\n\nBut Atkinson argued that the \u201cconversation around safety is always absent the people in communities who experience crime in violence at the highest levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we think about safety, we usually think about police, prosecution, probation. But when you look at the communities that produce the lowest indexes of rapes, robberies, murders per capita in the country, those communities have green space. They have thriving schools and economic opportunity and housing.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, he said, \u201cWhen you look at the least advantaged communities, the communities that produce the highest index with the rapes, robberies, homicides, those communities only have a police presence. They only have a prosecutorial presence. They don\u2019t have thriving schools and economic opportunity and safe and affordable housing \u2014 those other social economic indicators of health that produce safety.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCover thumbnail photo: Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker.
