It will come into effect from January 31, 2020.\n\nHowever, passing a joint to someone could still lead to an arrest as it would count as supplying narcotics, according to the ACT\u2019s chief police officer Ray Johnson.\n\n\"If there's evidence that someone is providing cannabis to someone else (even with no money involved), that's supply and that's an offence,\" he said.\n\nThe legislation was passed in spite of the fact it conflicts with Commonwealth laws prohibiting cannabis. In the event of contradictions between state or territory law and Commonwealth law, the latter prevails.\n\nThe Australian Capital Territory (ACT) government sought the advice of Commonwealth prosecutors and received two responses; the first confirming that the ACT\u2019s laws would provide a defence to anyone charged under Commonwealth law, and the second rescinding that advice and suggesting it was a matter with \u201clegal complexities that had not initially been appreciated\u201d.\n\nPeople attend a 420 pro-cannabis rally in Melbourne Credit: DAVID CROSLING/EPA-EFE/REX More\n\nMr Johnson said ACT police officers would support the government on the new laws.\n\nAs of Jan 31, cannabis users in the ACT could only face charges under Commonwealth law if Commonwealth officials chose to make an arrest, and would only be prosecuted if the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions thought it were appropriate to do so.\n\nAntonio Di Dio, president of the ACT branch of the Australian Medical Association, told The Telegraphthat legislating around cannabis was \u201ca vexed and complex issue\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that is it recognised first and foremost as a health issue. The inappropriate use of cannabis has significant negative health outcomes. I think the government have been quite sober and responsible in its efforts.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cWe also feel that in terms of cannabis possession or use in an appropriate context a system similar to traffic fines would be more appropriate\u2026 to say: \u2018We don\u2019t approve of this but it shouldn\u2019t go anywhere near the criminal justice system.\u2019\u201d\n\nDr Di Dio added that it would be \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that a Commonwealth prosecution for personal use of cannabis would take place.", "description": "Canberra will become the first place in Australia to legalise cannabis for personal recreational use after a landmark law was passed on Wednesday.\u00a0 The Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly passed legislation allowing possession of up to 50 grams per person and a maximum of four cannabis", "authors": ["Giovanni Torre"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xwczK.oWwNn4yrwf3CdqKw--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/f04481e2872dd0e26f2d49c004bda78e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
