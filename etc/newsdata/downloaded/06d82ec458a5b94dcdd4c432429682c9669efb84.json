If you choose to move, you won\u2019t be charged an exit fee for taking your custom elsewhere.\n\nPhilippa Pickford, at Ofgem, said: \"Toto Energy customers do not need to worry, as under our safety net we\u2019ll make sure your energy supplies are secure and customers\u2019 credit balances are protected.\n\n\"Ofgem will now choose a new supplier for you and whilst we\u2019re doing this our advice is to \u2018sit tight\u2019 and don\u2019t switch. You can rely on your energy supply as normal. We will update you when we have chosen a new supplier, who will then get in touch about your new tariff.\"\n\nToto is the eighth energy supplier to go bust this year, hot on the heels of Ofgem\u2019s announcement to toughen up the rules for existing providers, to minimise the risk of more of them going out of business.\n\nThis would include new checks for growing suppliers to make sure they can effectively serve their customers. If they fail the checks, they would be stopped from taking new customers on.\n\n\u201cThis latest supplier failure must raise serious questions for the regulator, which allowed it to acquire over 40,000 customers from another now-defunct energy company only three months ago,\" explained energy expert Cordelia Samson at Uswitch.\n\n\u201cToto were known to be struggling with customer service and running their operations efficiently. They also missed making their payments for renewable energy this year. While they had made improvements, clearly these weren\u2019t enough to keep them afloat.\n\n\u201cHouseholds affected by this news should now wait for a new supplier to be appointed by Ofgem. In the meantime, their energy supplies and credit balances will be protected, and they should take a meter reading ready for when the new supplier contacts them.\u201d\n\nHave you been affected by this news?
