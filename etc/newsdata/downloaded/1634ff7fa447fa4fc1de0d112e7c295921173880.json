Mostly because the Emmys audience started laughing at them.\n\nBASICALLY, it seems like people in the audience thought Kim was making a joke when she said \"Our family knows firsthand how truly compelling television comes from real people just being themselves.\" Ya know, because literally no one would describe Keeping Up with the Kardashians as \"real people just being themselves\" let alone describe the show as \"unfiltered and unscripted,\" which Kendall tried to claim.\n\nBut here's the deal: turns out this moment was meant to be tongue-and-cheek, and Kim and Kendall simply hadn't gotten a chance to be briefed on their teleprompter script before the show. In other words, they didn't realize that they were supposed to deliver those lines as a joke. At least that's what a source implied to Us Weekly, saying that Kim and Kendall \u201cwere not briefed\u201d about the the script being \u201ca joke\" and that \u201cit was definitely a bit awkward.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd while the sisters looked pretty pissed at the audience's laughter, apparently they weren't sweating it. \u201cKim and Kendall were good sports about it,\u201d another source told the magazine. \u201cThe line was supposed to be funny. They weren\u2019t bothered by people laughing.\u201d\n\nCool, I'll still be here all:\n\nDid everyone just laugh after The Kardashians after said something how they \u201care just being themselves?\u201d Haha\n\n\n\nSo awkward. #Emmys2019 pic.twitter.com/2bcWjZVVBl\n\n\n\n\u2014 \ud835\udd4b\ud835\udd59\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd44\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd64\ud835\udd64\ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd44\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd5f\ud835\udd55\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd57\ud835\udd44\ud835\udd56 (@MessyMindofMe) September 23, 2019\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "No words, just \ud83d\ude2c.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.F8vLGymYDs7r4ODBnkGSw--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9Mjg3ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/ad064025b045f9ee0e7f5215f562acf2", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
