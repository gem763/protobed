They have built up a thriving funds management business with offices in Sydney and Singapore.\n\nBut there is a certain mystery surrounding the Regal success story. Why has one of the best performing fund managers in Australia failed to attract the sort of fund flows enjoyed by rivals such as Magellan Financial Group?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegal has been operating for 15 years and now has $2.4 billion under management. Magellan has been operating for 13 years and has $92 billion under management.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Magellan co-founder Hamish Douglass was admitted into the Australian Fund Management Foundation Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nKing says the difference between the funds flow at Regal and Magellan is all about marketing.\n\nTo remedy that distribution weakness at Regal, King last week appointed Rebecca Fesq as global head of distribution and marketing. She previously worked as head of client service and direct at Pendal Group.\n\nChanticleer wonders if the yawning gap in fund flows between Regal and Magellan is because of factors other than lack of marketing.\n\nAre the asset consultants who act as gatekeepers to institutional funds flows worried about backing a fund manager that sells stocks short?\n\nAre the powerful wealth management platforms used by financial advisers giving Regal a fair go?\n\nAre financial advisers who hold the purse strings of so many self managed super funds uncomfortable recommending a fund manager who is not a household name?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne factor that has favoured Douglass at Magellan has been the surge in super fund investment in offshore markets.\n\nRegal has five separate strategies open for business: Absolute Return ($843 million funds under management), Market Neutral ($449 million FUM), Australian Long Short Equity ($191 million FUM), Small Companies ($264 million FUM) and Global Equity Income Fund ($7 million FUM).\n\nThe Global Equity Income Fund was started in March.\n\nIn a presentation to investors this month, King said one of the advantages Regal had over its competitors was its in 25 investment staff undertaking original research. The staff include two medical doctors covering healthcare.\n\nKing says in-house research has become crucial because of the decline in broker research coverage. He says the number of companies with fewer than five brokers covering them has more than doubled over the past decade.\n\nRegal focuses its research on 500 companies in Australia and more than 5000 in Asia.\n\nIn small caps, Regal has found the sort of growth that cannot be found in large caps. While the top 10 companies in the S &P ASX200 had forecast compound annual growth in earnings of 3 per cent between 2018 and 2022 a basket of 10 small cap stocks owned by Regal have forecast compound earnings growth of 43 per cent over the same period.\n\nKing\u2019s latest market presentation names two long positions and three short positions.\n\nThe two longs are Appen and Seven Group. The three shorts are Dominos Pizza, Ramsay Health Care and Celltrion Inc.\n\nOther members of the Hall of Fame are Chris Kourtis, Catherine Allfrey, Paul Taylor, John Sevior, Rob Patterson, Geoff Wilson, Peter Morgan, Anton Tagliaferro, Paul Xiradis, Robert Maple-Brown, Merv Peacock, Kerr Neilson, Warren McCullagh and Charles Macek.", "description": "Phil King from Regal Funds Management has emerged from the annual fund manager awards in Sydney as a member of the prestigious hall of fame.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5217%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_174%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3b6a57d3374ada95a598fd155174c4ece85096d3", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
