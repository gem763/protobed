Since the first novel in the series, Northern Lights, was published in 1995, the books have been revered for their capacity to plunge readers into a complex adult world that nevertheless foregrounds child characters. By the same token, Pullman\u2019s words resonated with both the young and culturally attuned adults, who appreciated his stock of grand literary influences from John Milton to William Blake and William Morris.\n\nMore like this\n\n- The best superhero show ever made\n\n- The Breaking Bad movie is a disaster\n\n- Is Game of Thrones the last great TV blockbuster?\n\nNow the BBC and HBO have created a new adaption of the series that features an array of international acting talent, including Ruth Wilson, James McAvoy and Lin Manuel-Miranda. It is written by British dramatist Jack Thorne, who also created the Harry Potter stage sequel The Cursed Child, and will attempt to bring Pullman\u2019s complex world to a new TV audience.\n\nBut why adapt this decades old trilogy now? Thorne has said that \u201cwe live in scary times and I think there\u2019s so much in Philip\u2019s book that\u2019s about now and where we\u2019re at now, even more than when he first wrote it\u201d.\n\nAnd he\u2019s right. His Dark Materials is a fantasy series that is pertinent for a time when there are grave fears worldwide that democratic processes and institutions are under threat, whether they be in Trump\u2019s US or in other countries where populist leaders and movements have won favour. However, adapting epic fantasy novels and trying to retain all their themes is fraught with difficulties as fans of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune, for example, can attest.\n\nIndeed there has been one unsuccessful attempt to adapt His Dark Materials before: the 2007 Hollywood film The Golden Compass, which omitted the books\u2019 darker themes and flopped at the box office. The creators of this version have evidently learnt the lessons of that failure. Thorne has worked closely with Pullman so that his vision is not diluted in any way. The pair had regular meetings so that Thorne could \u201cserve the books\u201d and bounce ideas off him.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the epic nature of the story suits a lavish slow-burn TV series more than it does a feature film format and will hopefully give Pullman\u2019s series the cultural reach of Game of Thrones. Like GoT, His Dark Materials features a huge cast of characters and a complex plot, which at first is a lot to take in.\n\nHis Dark Materials suggests that it is important each individual person questions what they experience \u2013 Dr Philippa Semper\n\nAt its heart is 11-year-old heroine, Lyra who travels through parallel worlds with a daemon and a truth-telling alethiometer (or golden compass). All humans have a daemon (Lyra\u2019s is called Pantalaimon) and they represent a part of their personality, like alter-egos. The daemons shapeshift into different animals until their \u2018owner\u2019 reaches puberty. Lyra embarks on a multi-universe odyssey that begins at a quintessentially British location \u2013 a Victorian-inspired Oxford containing colleges where elderly masters argue over archaic laws.\n\nThis is a recognisable, naturalistic world in one respect, yet filled with fantastical detail, with the scholastic setting coloured by airships, nomadic river dwellers and child abductions conducted by a mysterious group, which locals call the \u2018Gobblers\u2019. Lyra\u2019s journey begins here but soon she embarks on a quest north to find a kidnapped friend, where she encounters armoured bears, the mysterious Dust (elementary particles that rain down from time to time and some characters interpret as being triggered by sinfulness) and the truth about the Gobblers.\n\nA study of unchecked power\n\nMeanwhile, all these lands are controlled by a sinister religious order called the Magisterium. In the adaptation\u2019s opening episode, the Master of the college where the orphaned Lyra lives and studies, says \u201cmen and women are moved by tides much fiercer than you can imagine\u201d. The Master may be talking about the Magisterium but he is also articulating a very prescient fear \u2013 of unknown, unchecked power.\n\nWith the Magisterium, Pullman has created a totalitarian governing church who act clandestinely and without recognisable religious clothing. Instead, as shown in the series, they have sombre black suits, and are steeped in the modern-day language of power. The Magisterium are not discussing religious doctrine. They are discussing something rather less abstract: how to keep controlling their citizens.\n\nThe supremacy of a religious establishment is something that cultural historian and novelist Professor Dame Marina Warner says has the upmost relevance today.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s religious leaders are beginning to have more influence than they used to,\u201d she tells BBC Culture.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing fundamentalism being a real problem with [US President] Trump playing to that very virulent brand of Christian fundamentalism.\u201d\n\nIf the Magisterium may especially resonate with 2019 audiences, then so, too, will young heroine Lyra, who unknowingly, at first, challenges their fundamentalism via her mission to find her friend and the other abducted children. She is a passionate fighter for a cause she believes in and won\u2019t stop her voyage, despite adult protestations.\n\nIn the series, she is played with convincing energy by 14-year-old British-Spanish actress Dafne Keen, as at once vulnerable and unstoppable, fiercely loyal to her friends but suspicious of adults. She is also yearning for parental love \u2013 something her uncle, Lord Asriel, played by James McAvoy, is not in a position to provide. He, like Lyra, has a higher calling and wants to find evidence of The Magisterium\u2019s conspiracies. But because of this he rejects any attachment with his niece.\n\nThorne has compared Lyra to Greta Thunberg, another child who is on a quest to the save the world, and recently crossed the Atlantic in a sailboat to highlight adult folly. Both are free-thinkers and willing to challenge the status quo \u2013 one of Pullman\u2019s leitmotifs.\n\n\u201cHis Dark Materials suggests that it is important each individual person questions what they experience,\u201d says Dr Philippa Semper, a lecturer of English literature in University of Birmingham.\n\nIt\u2019s very important that our writers take us to places [where] we confront what we don\u2019t understand. Easy answers are the fodder of snake oil merchants \u2013 Marina Warner\n\n\u201cAnd to develop their knowledge and have this sense of inquiry, that means that they find things out for their selves and that they are not merely handed down information from a dictatorial church or an authoritarian state.\u201d\n\nSo forceful is His Dark Material\u2019s worldview that religious groups have long criticised the books and even tried to ban them in schools in the US a decade ago. It was news that former teacher Pullman greeted with amusement at the time, especially because it goes against the very free-thinking his trilogy champions. This attempt at censorship became a badge of honour for him \u2013 and Warner notes that after this, his \u201cmilitary atheism became more pronounced\u201d.\n\nThe mysteries it holds\n\nIf Pullman\u2019s work can be seen at times as anti-establishment, though, is it therefore, ironically and inadvertently, populist in outlook, supporting those who would gain political capital by criticising \u2018elites\u2019? While the Magisterium is definitely an elite, it\u2019s a push to claim he is on any side, especially because populist ideas are often criticised for offering easy answers, and such simple solutions are the antithesis of Pullman\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cThe world is mysterious,\u201d as Warner puts it. \u201cIt\u2019s not fully understood at all. It\u2019s very important that our writers take us to places [where] we confront what we don\u2019t understand and continue to realise that we don\u2019t understand it. Easy answers, glib solutions are the fodder of snake oil merchants\u201d.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s arguable that His Dark Materials is actually the very antidote to populism, offering colour and shade instead of easy answers.\n\nIf there is one disappointing thing in the otherwise excellent first episode of the new TV adaptation, it is that it opens with a rather reductive explanation of the all-important daemons \u2013 \u201chere, a human soul takes the physical form of an animal, known as a daemon\u201d which is something the books never explicitly stated, allowing the reader to think for themselves. In fact, Semper tells me, there has been a lot of debate about what the daemons represent \u2013 and whether in fact, in a reversal of the above, the human \u2018owners\u2019 are the daemons' souls made physical. She also adds that some academics have speculated that they could be two beings with a shared consciousness.\n\nSuch complexities place Pullman\u2019s work high in the fantasy canon. \u201cIt breaks away dramatically from the tropes established by some of the giants of fantasy literature before Pullman,\u201d says Dr Dimitra Fimi, lecturer in Fantasy and Children's Literature at the University of Glasgow.\n\nPullman is also a great champion of the underdog as evidenced by the Gyptians, who live humbly on canal barges, but are no lumpen proletariat\n\nIt does this by offering a more nuanced universe where every player is capable of good and bad. Unlike in The Lord of the Rings, for example, this isn\u2019t a fight between armies of good versus evil, the latter seeking total destruction, but a more realistic exploration of how good and evil are behaviours rather than defining labels.\n\nPullman is also a great champion of the underdog as evidenced by the Gyptians, who live humbly on canal barges, but are no lumpen proletariat. They are a group of people who, although they live on the fringes of life, are not willing to be sidelined when their children are kidnapped. They are capable of brutality, but also tenderness, and show Pullman\u2019s optimism in the human spirit. The Gyptians could be seen to be a riposte to the way the working class are often depicted \u2013 they demonstrate the power to affect change through collective action \u2013 while equally, their depiction as itinerant outsiders could be viewed as a redress to the kind of rhetoric that views migrant communities with suspicion. The series brings these characters to the forefront from the start and makes their plight gripping. Their golden-sun-lit canal setting also provides a vivid visual contrast to the bleak snowscapes of the north.\n\nCertainly, on evidence of the opening episode, all the omens for a successful adaptation look good \u2013one that respects Pullman\u2019s deft characterisation, readiness to discuss uncomfortable themes and rich settings.\n\n\u201cHe is a sort of moralist,\u201d Warner says. \u201cLike Charles Dickens was. But he\u2019s clever enough to disguise it. Pullman is too skilful a storyteller to let it show all the time.\u201d\n\nDickens was the ultimate chronicler of Victorian times. His Dark Materials, and its new small-screen incarnation, shows that Pullman is worthy of being considered as the modern-day equivalent.\n\nHis Dark Materials begins on BBC1 in the UK on November 3 and HBO in the US on November 4\n\nLove TV?
