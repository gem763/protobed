(Alex Brandon)\n\nColumnist\n\nThe story of the Washington Mystics\u2019 championship should be about nothing more than a team of fierce ballers who simply out-balled everyone else.\n\nThey made history, winning the WNBA title for the first time in the franchise\u2019s 22 seasons, beating the Connecticut Sun, 89-78, in the fifth and final game of theWNBA Finals on Thursday night.\n\nAnd, like any other championship team, it was that delicious combination of coaching, chemistry and insane work ethic that gave them the crackling electricity you can feel from a team that\u2019s winning and winning.\n\n[Mystics cap an emotional year with the title]\n\nHere\u2019s what their championship basketball win story should not be about:\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t have to talk about the long-awaited arena they finally got after decades of sharing the downtown stage with the NBA Wizards or vagabonding around in college gyms.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be smirking just a little when we mention that this arena stands on the grounds of the old St. Elizabeths Hospital, once the nation\u2019s largest psychiatric facility and in the city\u2019s most impoverished, underemployed, violent and neglected ward.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be congratulating them for their genuine bonding with their Ward 8 neighborhood and fan base, for being on the bow-wave of a new age of investment and development in the part of the city that usually doesn\u2019t get this kind of attention. We won\u2019t dare call it maternal.\n\nAnd do we need to remind D.C. that the Mystics are part of the narrative that makes the city a sports town? To stop pining away for the football team and the baseball boys?\n\nAnd maybe we shouldn\u2019t have to use this as a time to mention the consistent and staggering pay gap in women\u2019s professional sports.\n\nThe WNBA players pay is disgraceful. The highest-paid player in the league, Phoenix\u2019s DeWanna Bonner, makes just $127,500 a year, according to High Post Hoops.\n\nMystics star and league MVP Elena Delle Donne spoke out last year about the pay disparities, when she was making $107,000 and was tired of the trope that women\u2019s sports can\u2019t hold fans.\n\nShe began speaking out \u201cbecause I want it to be better for the next generation coming through,\u201d she told the Philadelphia Inquirer\u2019s Ben Pope. \u201cKnowing how hard we all work and how talented we all are, and just not getting the props and the pay that we deserve.\u201d\n\nAnd no, it\u2019s not only about ticket sales. It\u2019s about the value the league places on these players. NBA players get 50 percent of league revenue, while the WNBA players get just 20 percent, according to Forbes.\n\nDo we also have to use a championship win to extol the players\u2019 bravery and their honest, social activism? The out-and-proud, same-sex marriage of Delle Donne. The Athletes + Activism events that explore social justice issues. The special section for victims of gun violence and the backpacks for neighborhood children organized by point guard Natasha Cloud.\n\n[Delle Donne had to work to love basketball again]\n\nAnd just because they\u2019re female, do we have to linger on the raw pioneer-woman persistence and pain they muscle through? The back problems that sidelined Delle Donne and Ariel Atkins just days ago seemed like a memory as they dominated the court Thursday night. How is it possible that the towering Goddess statue come to life, Delle Donne, struggles with chronic Lyme disease?\n\nThere are female champions every year in the WNBA, so do we still have to dwell on the importance of seeing a woman hoisting a trophy above her head in a flurry of confetti as a common sight? Do those girls really need to see one to be one, or is it just okay that men are the usual default in that victory montage?\n\nWhen women win the same way men win, we tend to give it all a greater mission, to make it a movement and a moment, to put it all in some greater, historical context.\n\nCan\u2019t they just be the best ballers that day?\n\nYes and no.\n\nThe fact is, these women aren\u2019t making the NBA minimum of over $800,000 a year; they can\u2019t really take the summer off; and their games aren\u2019t broadcast during prime time. Heck, their historic win wasn\u2019t even on the top of The Washington Post\u2019s home page the morning after. Their win is still different. Their hills remain steeper. Their barricades are still higher.\n\nTrue equality will happen when their win is just a win.\n\nBut for now, the women of the Washington Mystics will have to be celebrated for being social justice warriors, neighborhood advocates and brave individualists who also happen to the best damn ballers in the country.\n\nTwitter: @petulad", "description": "Because true equality means it\u2019s basketball, not women\u2019s basketball.
