The months between August and November, when the farmers gathered their crops for winter storage, were referred to simply as harvest. But, as more of the population swapped working the land for living in towns, the word lost its reference to the time of year and came to refer solely to the act of reaping crops.", "description": "Other parts of the world have their own wonderful ways of referring to the season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p05j6t1t.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
