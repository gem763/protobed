As he took the podium, before introducing his wife, he stated, \u201cWe\u2019re going to win, we\u2019re going to win so big.\u201d And it is, perhaps, because Trump has, as the song goes, \u201cno time for losers,\u201d that his campaign never bothered to ask permission for the use of the stadium classic.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump walked out to introduce Melania Trump to \"We Are The Champions\" #RNCinCLEhttps://t.co/wuR94E1yid \u2014 BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) July 19, 2016\n\n\u201cI can confirm that permission to use the track was neither sought nor given,\u201d Brian May, a founding member of Queen, wrote in an open letter reassuring upset fans. \u201cRegardless of our views on Mr. Trump\u2019s platform, it has always been against our policy to allow Queen music to be used as a political campaigning tool.\u201d\n\n\n\nShortly after his appearance, the band\u2019s deceased front man Freddie Mercury, under the incorrect spelling \u201cFreddy Mercury,\u201d began trending on Twitter. Many users believed that the British vocalist, who was gay, would not have approved of the use of his song for Republican purposes.
