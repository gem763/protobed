But as the trio crossed in front of an open window repeatedly saying the n-word louder and louder, a person inside wasn\u2019t just observing \u2014 they were recording.\n\nNow, university officials say an investigation into the 11-second video, which started to widely circulate on social media earlier this month, has prompted campus police to arrest and charge two students Monday night with violating a Connecticut hate crime statute.\n\nJarred Karal and Ryan Mucaj, both 21 and described by police as white, were charged with ridicule on account of creed, religion, color, denomination, nationality or race. The misdemeanor charge is punishable by a maximum of 30 days in jail, a fine of up to $50, or both, according to state law.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Nation Uconn-Video-White-Students-Arrested-Yelling-N-Word"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
