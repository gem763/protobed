Cyrus seemed to have a gay old time at said hospy. Her mother Tish brushed her hair, she redesigned her hospital gown into a \u201c#punkrockbabydollhalter\u201d with \"kinda @ysl @courtneylove / @skyferreira vibes\u201d (an apt descriptor); photographer Vijat Mohindra and designer Bradley Kenneth came to visit and covered her hospital bed in rose petals, leading to an iconic Instagram stories post captioned with \"I \u2764\ufe0fMY MAIN GAYS!\"\n\nLongtime friend and new, very public boyfriend Cody Simpson serenaded Cyrus from her sickbed (he also brought roses). And now that Cyrus is home and well, she and Simpson are still having the time of their lives. She posted a photo of the two to her Instagram stories, writing that \u201cshe made it home Recovering from surgery send all the vibe$.\u201d Cyrus also posted a video in which she brushes her teeth while Simpson chuckles and poses in the mirror.\n\nMore\n\nAs we must unfortunately point out, Simpson is shirtless in both posts. The other day Cyrus wrote on her Instagram story that the singer is very much up her alley: \u201c22 [check] Australian (my type) [check] Abs [check].\u201d\n\nCyrus\u2019s romantic life has been a wild ride lately. Following her divorce from Liam Hemsworth (also Australian), her on-and-off partner of a decade, Cyrus dated The Hills star Kaitlynn Carter for about six weeks. Less than two weeks after their breakup, Cyrus was spotting kissing Simpson over acai bowls in LA. \u201cI am just trying to THRIVE/survive in a \u2018mans\u2019 world,\u201d Cyrus tweeted. \u201cIf our president can \u2018grab em by the pussy\u2026,\u2019 can\u2019t I have a kiss and a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl?\u201d\n\nOriginally Appeared on W\n\n", "description": "Be sure to send her \"all the vibe$\" as she recovers from surgery.", "authors": ["Jocelyn Silver"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IhAYsFFNbbFjUZ_N0VXQ_w--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9NzUwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/w_988/66675106e51529cac33cb2a6eeacf698", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
