The man has said openly on national television that he\u2019d \u201cprobably\u201d accept dirt on a political rival from foreign sources. He knew the Ukrainians had an investigation on the backburner that might eventually reach Hunter Biden and, more importantly, efforts by Joe Biden to pressure Ukraine into removing the prosecutor in charge. No personal ethic was going to restrain him from pursuing it, especially if he had Biden\u2019s actions to cite as precedent if he was caught.\n\nThe surprise in this story is that he supposedly didn\u2019t threaten to withhold the $250 million in military aid that Ukraine had been promised if President Zelensky refused to reopen the Biden probe, at least as far as the Journal\u2019s sources know. But of course Zelensky knew that that money hadn\u2019t been approved yet by the White House when he and Trump had their phone call. And Trump knew that he knew. If you\u2019re waiting on a life-and-death loan from the bank and the head of the bank calls you up asking for a personal favor, does he need to literally say the words \u201cdo it or you won\u2019t get your loan\u201d for you to understand the consequences if you decline?\n\nI can\u2019t believe how much alcohol I\u2019m going to need to consume to cope with a 13-month debate about whether an implicit demand for a quid pro quo is meaningfully different from an explicit one.\n\nPresident Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden \u2019s son, urging Volodymyr Zelensky about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, on a probe, according to people familiar with the matter. \u201cHe told him that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know\u201d whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said. Mr. Trump didn\u2019t mention a provision of foreign aid to Ukraine on the call, said this person, who didn\u2019t believe Mr. Trump offered the Ukrainian president any quid-pro-quo for his cooperation on an investigation\u2026 The August meeting [between Giuliani and a Ukrainian official] came weeks before the Trump administration began reviewing the status of $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine, which the administration released earlier this month. Mr. Giuliani said he wasn\u2019t aware of the issue with the funds to Ukraine at the time of the meeting.\n\nAn interesting theory:\n\nMSNBC's @jheil speculating the @wsj got fed the story by the White House to shape narrative that Trump made no promises to Ukraine in exchange for investigating Hunter Biden. \u2014 David Rutz (@DavidRutz) September 20, 2019\n\nThe Journal story *is* favorable to the White House in that it claims there was no explicit demand for a quid pro quo. Maybe it\u2019s a limited hangout, with Team Trump omitting some key details of the conversation but admitting that the president pressured Zelensky on Biden because they assume that detail is destined to come out somehow anyway. Remember that the reporting this week has claimed that there was a \u201cpromise\u201d of some sort made by Trump to an unnamed foreign leader. There\u2019s nothing about that in this new Journal piece. How to square the two?\n\nWhat if Trump said, \u201cZelensky, you really should investigate Biden,\u201d and then later in their chat, after Zelensky sounded receptive about Biden, Trump had also said, \u201cI promise, you\u2019ll get your military aid\u201d? There\u2019s no explicit quid pro quo there, i.e. \u201cdo this for me and I\u2019ll do that for you.\u201d But it would have been clear to both parties what was being discussed.\n\nPelosi is talking tough this afternoon, but whatever. No one takes her seriously anymore on oversight given her adamant resistance to impeachment.\n\nPelosi issues lengthy statement on the whistleblower complaint: \u201cIf the President has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his Administration and our democracy.\u201d pic.twitter.com/JMZJs0E2Aq \u2014 Andrew Desiderio (@AndrewDesiderio) September 20, 2019\n\nHillary\u2019s doing her part to goose the story too:\n\nThe president asked a foreign power to help him win an election. Again.https://t.co/EjkE84oCCF \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 20, 2019\n\nThe president wasn\u2019t the only candidate to receive help from a foreign power in 2016. And he didn\u2019t commission a dossier on his opponent consisting of innuendo from foreign sources. But I digress.\n\nMost interesting of all among the Democratic reactions is that of Team Biden, which is curiously quiet about this alleged U.S./Ukraine conspiracy to wreck his presidential chances:\n\nJoe Biden, leaving an event just now in Cedar Rapids, was asked by reporters about the Ukraine reports. \u201cNo comment,\u201d he said while adding the country \u201cneeds the president to start being president.\u201d \u2014 Henry J. Gomez (@HenryJGomez) September 20, 2019\n\n\u201cNo comment other than the president should start to be president,\u201d Biden concludes. (This is the precise wording of the quote in the first tweet of this thread.) \u2014 Henry J. Gomez (@HenryJGomez) September 20, 2019\n\nMaybe Biden\u2019s doing what he can to downplay this since he\u2019s worried what reporters will find once they start sniffing around his communications as VP with Ukraine. Or, more charitably, maybe he senses that nothing good can come from added media attention to this subject no matter how it shakes out. Even if his interest in pressuring Ukraine several years ago was an earnest anti-corruption pitch, not a favor he did for his son, Warren would be a fool not to try to make hay of it. She doesn\u2019t even need to claim that she believes Biden was corrupt. She can make an electability argument instead: \u201cI don\u2019t think you were behaving unethically, Joe, but Republicans are going to blast you with this every day for the next year if you\u2019re the nominee. By the time they\u2019re done, the election will be a coin flip. We need a candidate who doesn\u2019t have this baggage.\u201d What will swing voters say to that?\n\nUpdate: A good question. If this is all just hardball diplomacy, why is the president\u2019s personal lawyer involved?", "description": "Demands.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-12.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
