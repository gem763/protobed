While he was pondering a new exhibit about political prisoners, Ai was contacted by the San Francisco gallerist and curator Cheryl Haines with a proposal: she had the connections to provide him with a sensational site for the event \u2013 Alcatraz prison, the former US federal penitentiary, closed since 1963 and now a tourist destination.\n\nThey agreed that this would be a dramatic showcase, and would relate to Alcatraz\u2019s shabby 19th-century record of imprisoning Hopi Native Americans who refused to be \u201cAmericanised\u201d in their education, and also honour the Native American protest-occupation of Alcatraz Island in 1969. Haines has now directed a very absorbing and valuable documentary about the creation of this artwork, which relates to Ai\u2019s honourable record of using art as memorialist-activism.\n\nIt includes powerful interviews with Ai\u2019s mother Gao Ying and brother Ai Xuan, and movingly puts Ai\u2019s work into personal context \u2013 that is, the Chinese government\u2019s treatment in the 1950s of Ai\u2019s late father, the dissident poet Ai Qing, transported to a remote labour camp with his wife and two young sons who were the intimate witnesses to Ai\u2019s brutalisation and humiliation. This was the horrendous experience that drove this event, and perhaps Ai\u2019s career.\n\nAi effectively created the installation \u2013 entitled @Large \u2013 at long distance, with Haines travelling back and forth between China and the US to discuss it. The centrepiece would be a gallery of political prisoners from countries around the world, rendered with Lego bricks in a kind of analogue-pixellation, with visitors encouraged to write morale-boosting prepaid postcards to the prisoner of their choice, inspired by a postcard of support that Ai Qing himself received. The exhibit was a huge success, with 900,000 visitors and 92,829 cards sent, including to Americans such as Chelsea Manning, the former US soldier imprisoned for disclosing documents to Wikileaks, and John Kiriakou, the former CIA analyst and anti-waterboarding campaigner, imprisoned for disclosing information to a reporter.\n\nAfter the exhibit, dozens of the people featured in it were released, including Manning, Kiriakou and indeed Ai himself, who had his passport restored to him in 2015, and it may well have been this artwork that helped create the circumstances in which this was possible.\n\nThe events under discussion in this film are not exactly recent, and things have moved on a little. Manning is interviewed in the post-release situation created by the Obama pardon, although she was sent back to jail for refusing to comply with a grand jury investigation of Julian Assange. And there is a difficult moment when Haines\u2019s camera glimpses a Lego portrait of Aung San Suu Kyi, released since 2010, but at that stage still honoured as a human rights heroine. In 2019, the view of Suu Kyi is different.\n\nThe Chinese government may well have been embarrassed by Ai\u2019s new exhibit and by his growing international prestige \u2013 but also, perhaps, mollified by the fact that it was not simply directed at China but so many other countries, very prominently the US. So it may have been a cool piece of political diplomacy on Ai\u2019s part. But it was a tough, shrewd, persistent kind of campaigning, like the kind of old-fashioned letter-writing once encouraged by Amnesty International, and like Ai\u2019s investigative artistry in discovering and memorialising the names of children killed in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when the government were censoring the details. Haines\u2019s brief, well-made documentary is a very worthwhile guide to this venture, and to Ai Weiwei\u2019s own tragic family history.", "description": "A documentary about the making of the Chinese artist\u2019s @Large, a 2014 project set in the former penitentiary, reveals his family\u2019s own tragedy", "authors": ["Peter Bradshaw"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9f79c9e9a943ebe5c75213d7201e293ba31545e/26_0_1799_1080/master/1799.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=876b44e6576b7cec9ccea354255f06c8", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
