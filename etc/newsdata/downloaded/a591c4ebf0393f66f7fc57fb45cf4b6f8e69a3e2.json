The only other player to reach those marks was former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the 2012-13 postseason, when he tallied 263 passing yards and 181 rushing yards against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nJackson\u2019s rushing yardage total fell 14 yards shy of the single-game, regular-season record for an NFL quarterback. Former Atlanta Falcons dual-threat star Michael Vick had 166 rushing yards in the 2006 season against the New Orleans Saints.\n\nAfter the team\u2019s victory over the Bengals, Jackson said it was \u201cdope\u201d to be mentioned with Vick following his record-setting performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely dope, the guy you grew up watching all the time doing all this spectacular stuff, having my name mixed with his is pretty cool,\u201d Jackson told reporters Sunday.\n\nWith the win, the Ravens (4-2) remain atop the AFC North. Baltimore will play the Seattle Seahawks on Oct. 20.", "description": "Oct. 13 (UPI) \u2014 Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson established a new record for dual-threat quarterbacks in the team\u2019s 23-17 win over", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
