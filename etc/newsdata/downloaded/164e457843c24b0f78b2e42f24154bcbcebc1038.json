He was in Monaco and I wanted to sign him for Paris Saint-Germain.\n\n\"When I arrived here, also his name was on the table to achieve to sign him, but he signed for Liverpool.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"The first six months he didn't play, it was adaptation. But now he is amazing and I want the same with (Dani) Ceballos, with Pepe.\n\n\"We need patience, but Pepe is improving. On Monday, the key to win was with him. If he scores the first goal, it's different.\n\n\"But it's one process and I believe in him and I know we need time and patience. The supporters have patience, some more than others.\"\n\nPepe is likely to sit out Thursday night's Europa League Group F clash at home to Vitoria Guimaraes - but Emery could yet opt to include him in his side to give him another chance to impress and win over the early doubters.", "description": "Arsenal splashed out a fee in excess of \u00a370million to recruit Pepe in the summer but he has yet to make the desired impact", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20714379.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Sheffield-United-v-Arsenal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
