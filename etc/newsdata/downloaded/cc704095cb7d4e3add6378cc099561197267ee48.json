As the investigation into the man continues, more troubling facts have been revealed which show a major lapse in security.\n\nHis job gave Harpon a top security clearance and access to computers in a police department tasked with monitoring suspected radical Islamists in France, and he was found to be in possession of sensitive data. When they searched his home, investigators discovered the personal details of police officers who had infiltrated a number of mosques in Paris frequented by suspected radicals. The information was next to propaganda videos of the terrorist group Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS), which is worrisome, to say the least.\n\nAlso on rt.com Paris police knifeman \u2018heard voices\u2019 before deadly rampage\n\n\u201cIt's staggering as well as maddening. How was this person able to get through the net? This is amateurism that needs to be sorted out,\u201d Yves Lefebvre, a police union spokesman, commented on the discovery.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Harpon kept the information to himself or used it to warn fellow Islamists. The French government hopes he didn\u2019t share the data.\n\n\u201cI cannot guarantee he did not use his access to give information. For the time being, nothing indicates that he did,\u201d French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said in a radio interview.\n\nThe minister is on the defensive now that the French opposition and some media have accused him of negligence which, as Le Figaro\u2019s front-page editorial put it, allowed \u201cthe poison of radical Islam\u201d to penetrate \u201cthe heart of the state apparatus.\u201d\n\nHarpon is said to have converted to Islam around ten years ago, with his religious convictions becoming more extreme as the years went by. It has been revealed that he had had contact with suspicious individuals, including a suspected Salafist preacher. Salafism is a fundamentalist branch of Islam strongly associated with extremism.\n\nAlso on rt.com Paris police knifeman had \u2018radical vision of Islam,\u2019 anti-terrorism prosecutors say\n\nOfficials initially said Harpon\u2019s behavior at work sparked no suspicions, but according to fresh media reports, a number of red flags concerning him actually went unaddressed. He wouldn\u2019t kiss female colleagues on the cheeks, as is customary in France but forbidden under strict gender separation rules of Salafist Islam. In 2015, he purportedly defended the Charlie Hedbo shooting in an argument with a colleague, claiming the victims \u201chad it coming.\u201d A probe was launched at the time, but none of his coworkers would officially report Harpon.\n\nThe news that French police ranks had such a dangerous individual in a position of high trust is sending shockwaves across the force already struggling with plethora of problems, including dwindling salaries and uncertainty around pensions, a lack of manpower and skyrocketing suicide rates.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
