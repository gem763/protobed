Both times, he immortalized his observations in the book \"Irrational Exuberance.\"\n\nShiller is not done trying to understand what makes certain assets go viral among investors. And in an exclusive interview with Business Insider, the Yale University professor pinpointed one area of the markets of concern right now: long-term US government bonds.\n\nTreasurys have received a flood of inflows this year from investors who are worried about a global economic slowdown. While the US remains above water \u2014 largely thanks to consumer spending \u2014 major economies from the United Kingdom to Brazil and Germany have cascaded toward recessions.\n\nThe fervent purchases of long-term Treasurys has sent their yields to multiyear lows over the past few months; bond yields fall when their prices rise. In August, the 30-year yield touched an all-time low of 2.09%, while the 10-year fell below 1.5% to its lowest since 2016.\n\n\"Something very strange is going on,\" Shiller told Business Insider by phone. \"It seems unlikely that interest rates will stay so low for 30 years.\"\n\nRead more: The world's most accurate economic forecaster sees a 'prolonged global slowdown' on the horizon \u2014 and warns it can only be narrowly avoided\n\nWith yields at these historically low levels, investors are staring down the barrel of negative inflation-adjusted returns from an asset that has historically provided safe and steady income. The situation is even worse in several European countries where nominal interest rates have long been below zero.\n\nThe narratives driving markets\n\nIn making sense of the downtrend in Treasury yields and what caused them, recession fears are the clear culprits.\n\nBut Shiller identified at least two other narratives at play \u2014 and he explores several more that drive markets exuberance in a new book titled \"Narrative Economics.\"\n\nFirst, Shiller noted that demographic changes had been a factor in the decline in yields. The aging of baby boomers has sustained the demand for steady income that Treasurys offer.\n\nBut if you looked at this year's market action out of context, the trade war appears to be the only driver of demand.\n\nBesides demographics, Shiller said inequality was another narrative behind the precipitous drop in interest rates.\n\nHe was not referring to income imbalances on their own. Rather, inequality has spurred concerns about the social and policy implications of a more equal society.\n\nFor recent proof that Wall Street is stressed about inequality, look no further than the flurry of research being done to answer questions about what a 2020 win by Elizabeth Warren would mean for markets. The Massachusetts senator's presidential aspirations include higher taxes on the wealthy and breaking up the big banks.\n\nThis inequality narrative is adding to investor angst, along with more immediate challenges like the trade war. And safe-haven assets, including Treasurys, thrive on anxiety.\n\nAccording to Shiller, there's no easy way to add up all these narratives \u2014 recession fears, demographics, and inequality \u2014 and arrive at a forecast for what happens next in the Treasurys market.\n\nBut for now, he can firmly conclude that something in there is wrong.", "description": "In an exclusive interview, the Yale professor discussed what is \"very strange\" about an asset that's been extremely popular with investors this year.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9f90194af90911283ba807?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
