(Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters)\n\nThis major financial hub and usually vibrant city of 7 million was reduced to confusion and quiet on Saturday morning, as Hong Kong woke to find its entire subway system shut down, buses disrupted and supermarkets and malls shuttered in anticipation of more protests.\n\nThe semiautonomous Chinese territory is on edge after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced she would invoke rarely used emergency powers to ban masks at protests, a decision that immediately intensified anger and unrest on city streets. On Friday night, a peaceful march through the city spiraled into pockets of riots, as protesters torched subway stations and businesses linked to pro-Beijing tycoons.\n\nGlass shards remained scattered across pavements the next day from shops that had been vandalized and smashed up. The MTR Corporation, which operates the city\u2019s rail network, said it had to shut the entire network after \u201cthe outbreak of violence and multiple districts\u201d and had to ensure the safety of their staff. The unprecedented move was in effect for all of Saturday.\n\nEven always-reliable 7-Eleven convenience stores would be closed at of 5 p.m., the operator announced on its Facebook page.\n\nAmong the nearly three dozen hospitalized in the protests on Friday night was a 14-year old boy, shot in the left thigh by an undercover police officer. After he fired the shot, a group threw a petrol bomb at him, briefly setting him on fire.\n\n[Hong Kong leader invokes colonial-era emergency powers to ban masks, sparking more protests]\n\nThe police force characterized the shooting as justified, as did Lam, who addressed the city in a five-minute pretaped video released on Saturday afternoon. As she spoke in the recorded tape, she was flanked by over a dozen of her ministers.\n\n\u201cTo all citizens, extreme acts of rioters has brought a very dark night upon Hong Kong yesterday. The city is half paralyzed today,\u201d Lam said. \u201cWe encourage all citizens come out to condemn the violence, support the Hong Kong government, and to put a resolute end to the riots.\u201d\n\nProtesters on Saturday morning debated on online forums and secure messaging apps on the merits of \u201ctaking a rest\u201d amid the city shutdown, but others did not want to deliver the government a victory after the new government restriction. By 3 p.m. in the afternoon, a group of a few hundred had begun marching peacefully from the shopping district of Causeway Bay \u2014 many of them still wearing surgical masks.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to implement the mask ban and the use of emergency powers to do so came at a time of already heightened emotions in the city, after an 18-year old boy was shot in the chest by police in one of several chaotic protests in the city on Oct. 1 \u2014 the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The emergency powers, which date back to Hong Kong\u2019s time under British colonial rule in 1922, were last used during leftist riots in 1967 which left more than 50 dead.\n\nCritics have accused Hong Kong\u2019s government of once again being wholly out of touch with the population, as they were when they proposed legislation that would allow extradition to mainland China \u2014 the spark of the protest movement back in June. Demands have now swelled to include direct elections for Hong Kong, and \u2014 crucially \u2014 an independent investigation of a police force many fear is operating with impunity.\n\n[For many in Hong Kong, Beijing\u2019s troops are already here: The Hong Kong Police Force]\n\n\u201cThis is the really one very sad day for Hong Kong,\u201d said Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker, who said the government has not learned lessons over the unrest in recent months. \u201cThe reason why the people were out there protesting against the extradition bill is because they feared that their freedoms will be taken away.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNow, [the government has] demonstrated that the fears are justified, that the Hong Kong government will do anything to take away the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people.\u201d\n\nTiffany Liang and Timothy McLaughlin contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nThe evolution of Hong Kong\u2019s protests\n\nHong Kong leader fully withdraws extradition bill, but protesters say it's not enough\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Amid fears of fresh violence, supermarkets, convenience stores and the entire subway network were shut in the normally thronging city of 7 million.", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KrKECyEcen32aIQCfXWo_flgGY0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RP4YRFHHIQI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
