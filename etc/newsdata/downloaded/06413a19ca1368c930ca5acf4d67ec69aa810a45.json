And they\u2019ve snapped up tickets to four sold-out, high-dollar fundraisers for the president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe events are shrouded in secrecy to a large extent, necessitated by the deep hostility many in the state feel toward the president.\n\nStill, the tickets have sold \u201cfaster than Mick Jagger,\u2019\u2019 laughs former state party chair Shawn Steel, a Republican National Committee member and a Trump bundler.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of love here for him,\u201d says Steel, pointing to more than 1,000 Republicans, \u201cdonors at every level,\u201d who have clamored for tickets to four events within the next 24 hours including a lunch in Silicon Valley, two events in the Los Angeles/Beverly Hills area \u2014 a dinner Wednesday and a breakfast Thursday \u2014 and another lunch in San Diego on Thursday.\n\nAlready, state donors have given generously to his re-election campaign and the joint fundraising committee with the RNC, ponying up $6.5 million in checks from January to June of this year alone. At the Sept. 17 luncheon stop in the Bay Area, ticket prices range from $1,000 to $100,000.\n\nThis week, Trump\u2019s California fundraisers have attracted a new set of Republican donors and bundlers eager to be in the room with him in Northern and Southern California events, which could raise upward of $15 million, party insiders say.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I have maxed out \u2014 and I\u2019ve never maxed out for anybody, ever,\u2019\u2019 said San Francisco attorney Harmeet Dhillon, a former vice-chair of the party, who is hosting two tables at the Silicon Valley event. She says she has been deluged by requests for tickets from Republicans \u2014 big and small donors \u2014 who are desperate to be part of the scene.\n\nCalifornia Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.

Demonstrators have been trying to ferret out locations of the fundraisers, promising to stage protests and appearances by the giant \u201cbaby Trump\u201d balloon. The president\u2019s last campaign foray to the Bay Area, at an April 2016 GOP convention in Burlingame, didn\u2019t go so well \u2014 it featured the sight of Trump climbing a highway median to avoid protesters who blocked his hotel entry.\n\nDhillon said the Trump team is \u201ctaking no chances after the San Jose situation,\u2019\u2019 a reference to a different 2016 incident when Trump supporters were attacked outside of his rally at the San Jose Convention Center prior to the election. Tuesday\u2019s Bay Area lunch, originally scheduled for tony Atherton, apparently changed venues.\n\n\u201cWe originally got word he was coming [to Atherton], and the last update I got was that he was not coming,\u201d Dan Larsen, a sergeant with the Atherton Police Department, told the Mercury News Friday.\n\nWhile the White House and Trump re-election campaign declined to confirm the actual location, sources familiar with the event say the Bay Area fundraiser will be held at the Woodside estate of private equity firm CEO Saul Fox, who hosted Trump at his home for a 2016 fundraiser. Fox, who heads the firm Fox & Paine, is the GOP mega-donor behind Children of Israel LLC, whose $884,000 in contributions has made it \u201cthe second-most generous \u2018ghost corporation\u2019 in the 2016 cycle,\u2019\u2019 according to The Intercept.\n\nThe wealthy Peninsula community that\u2019s home to Fox\u2019s estate is also home to tech giants like Larry Ellison and Democratic venture capital star John Doerr, who famously hosted President Obama and tech titans \u2014 including Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 at a 2011 dinner in his nearby Woodside mansion.\n\nThe San Mateo County Sheriff\u2019s Department referred calls on the matter to the White House press office.\n\nAfter his Bay Area stop, the president will fly to Southern California for an evening event in the Beverly Hills-Bel Air 90210 area code. The fundraiser, held during Emmy Week \u2014 when awards celebrating the television industry, a favorite target of Trump\u2019s commentary, are handed out \u2014 is hosted by a longtime supporter, billionaire real estate mogul Geoffrey Palmer.\n\nPalmer, who donated more than $4 million to GOP causes in the 2018 cycle, is one of the early donors to Rebuilding America Now, the pro-Trump SuperPAC founded by former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort \u2014 now serving time for fraud \u2014 and Trump business ally Tom Barrack.\n\nTickets go from $1,000 to $10,000 per couple for a photo op at the event which, according to an invite, is also hosted RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, RNC co-chairman Tommy Hicks Jr., campaign manager Brad Parscale and Trump Victory finance chairman Todd Ricketts.\n\nLanhee Chen, a former adviser to presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, says California Republicans of all stripes are eager to get in on the president\u2019s first big fundraising foray here. One reason is their support for his contentious relationship with the state\u2019s Democratic leaders, who have filed more than 50 lawsuits against his administration.\n\n\u201dThey\u2019re energized by these fights between him and the left-leaning Democrats,''' Chen said, \"and they think he\u2019s taking it to them.\u201d\n\nAmong those eager Republicans ready to write checks to Trump\u2019s campaign are Celeste Grieg, a former head of the California Republican Assembly \u2014 one of the most conservative grassroots groups in the GOP \u2014 who will be at his event in Bel Air.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going because he\u2019s done a great job, maybe not perfect \u2014 but a great job,\u2019\u2019 said Grieg. \u201cYes, he\u2019s pissed some people off, but that\u2019s what he is...people have to get over that.\u2019\u2019\n\nGrieg says attendees have been promised appearances by Clint Eastwood \u2014 a movie icon who also served as the former mayor of Carmel, California \u2014 and Mel Gibson, another conservative Hollywood voice. And that, she says, is a welcome counter to high-profile Democratic Hollywood voices like Messing.\n\nThe next day, the president hits the San Diego area for another sold out fundraiser that insiders say is slated to raise $4 million for the Trump re-election campaign.\n\nCalifornia GOP chair Jessica Millan Patterson says that Trump\u2019s successful fundraising here underscores how Republicans in solidly blue California are clearly uniting behind the president as 2020 approaches \u2014 and how Trump\u2019s popularity has translated into more money for the state party as well.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Among all likely voters, his approvals are just 38 percent.\n\n\u201cWe certainly are on the right track. We were obviously outspent in 2018 by $100 million,\u2019\u2019 she said in regards to fundraising. \u201c[But] so far, there\u2019s 6,400 new donors on the smaller level, and 72 large scale major donors...so we\u2019re on the right track. And \u201cwe\u2019re $1.3 million ahead in commitments than we were in 2017,\u2019\u2019 she says.\n\nBill Whalen, a Hoover Institution fellow who advised former GOP Gov. Pete Wilson, says that despite California\u2019s solidly blue status and the state GOP\u2019s collapse here, \u201cpeople tend to forget that nearly 4 million voted for him in California in 2016..so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s without friends here.\u2019\u2019\n\n\"No sane political consultant thinks that Trump has a chance to win in California in 2020,\u2019\u2019 Whalen says. But the sold-out fundraisers reveal GOP appreciation of the president\u2019s engagement on California issues that matter to them such as homelessness, energy or auto emissions standards.\n\nThe question coming out of these event for Trump, he said, will be: \u201cIs this a one-off, or will there be any lingering presence in California?\"\n\nSteele predicts that the demand for tickets, and the size of Trump re-election multi-million dollar campaign haul from California this week is \u201cgoing to be enough to encourage him to keep coming back.\u201d", "description": "Donors are snapping up tickets, even if they don\u2019t know exactly where the events are being held.", "authors": ["Carla Marinucci"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a9/3e/d606c5a744ca80cfd4dd901d088c/190916-trump-hand-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
