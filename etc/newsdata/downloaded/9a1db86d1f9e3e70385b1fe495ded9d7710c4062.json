It was meant to playfully introduce a new character voiced by Ali Wong, but when this new kid in school boldly delivered an explanation of her sexuality to her new classmates, it ended up being a rather regressive summation of bisexuality versus pansexuality. \u201cBisexuality is so binary,\u201d says Wong\u2019s character. \u201cBeing pansexual means my sexual preference isn\u2019t limited by gender identity \u2026 It\u2019s like, some of you borings like tacos, and some of you like burritos. And if you\u2019re bisexual, you like tacos and burritos. But I\u2019m saying I like tacos and burritos, and I could be into a taco that was born a burrito, or a burrito that is transitioning into a taco, comprende? And honey, anything else on the fucking menu.\u201d\n\nGuys, @aliwong is now on @bigmouth.

Well, Big Mouth co-creator Andrew Goldberg has seen the reactions, and he would like to apologize. In a note posted to Twitter, Goldberg thanked the queer community for speaking up and said, \u201cThis time we could have done better.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s to lessons learned.", "description": "Andrew Goldberg, the co-creator of Netflix\u2019s Big Mouth, apologizes for the bad explanation of pansexuality in a recently posted clip from the show.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/07/7-bigmouth.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
