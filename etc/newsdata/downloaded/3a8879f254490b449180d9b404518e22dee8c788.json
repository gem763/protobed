Then he was off to Virginia on a brisk fall Saturday for a round at one of his golf courses.\n\nHe teed off with Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, in town for the World Series, and Sens. Lindsey Graham and David Perdue.\n\nTrump got back to the White House at 4:18 p.m. By 5 p.m., he was in a suit in the Situation Room in the basement of the West Wing to monitor the raid. They named it after Kayla Mueller, an American humanitarian worker abused and killed by al-Baghdadi.\n\nThe rest of Washington had its focus on Game 4 of the World Series about to get underway a few miles away at Nationals Park.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
