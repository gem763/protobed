Licence plates are already publicly-viewable things, so what\u2019s the point in obscuring them, right?\n\nWell, now I think there actually is a good reason to obscure your licence plates in photos because it appears that Google and Facebook are actually reading the plates in photos, and then making the actual licence plate alphanumeric sequence searchable. I tested it. It works.\n\nStarting with Google, the way this works is to search for the licence plate number using Google Images. That\u2019s it.\n\nIn my testing, I started with my own cars that I know have had images of their licence plates in their articles. For my Nissan Pao, a search of my licence plate number brings up an image of my car, from one of my articles, as the first result:\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the image search results aren\u2019t even trying to differentiate the search term as a licence plate; the number sequence has just been tagged to the photo automatically after whatever hidden Google OCR system reads the licence plate. This can mean that someone searching a similar sequence of characters could likely end up with a result for your car if enough of those characters match your licence plate.\n\nI tried again with the licence number for the Yugo fellow Jalop Mike Ballaban gave me, and was greeted with an even more impressive display of results:\n\nWoah, damn! Because this car has been photographed and written about a good bit, there\u2019s a lot of results here, and my name and other employees\u2019 names show up in those top links, too. Of course, I should mention that at no point did we tag the Yugo\u2019s licence plate number to any of these photos \u2014 that\u2019s all behind-the-scenes Google black magic.\n\nThe licence plate reader does not differentiate based on the national origin of plate \u2014 whatever that AI is doing, it seems to identify a car and a licence plate, and then reads the characters and tags the image with them. Here\u2019s a European plate used on a Mercedes press car:\n\nI also was able to learn that Volkswagen must be re-using plates on their press vehicles, because the VW California camper I just tested had a plate with the number HCA 187:\n\n...and that same plate shows up on a red camper from the previous year:\n\nSince it treats all countries equally, sometimes you can use it to find a car\u2019s foreign licence plate-twin, as I did with this V8-swapped Karmann Ghia I spotted on the road, which has an unexpected Eastern Bloc licence plate-twin:\n\nI obscured those plates because the Ghia didn\u2019t show up online. Yet.\n\nBack to company-owned press vehicles, here\u2019s the Jeep Gladiator I took on the Rubicon Trail, by licence plate:\n\nNow, many plates I searched for from other sources online didn\u2019t come up, but many did. It\u2019s safe to say that if there\u2019s a photo of your car online and the licence plate is visible, it will be read and tagged to the photo.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really all that much you can do about it. There are some ways you can maintain a bit more privacy, though, if you don\u2019t want your cars, like mine, to pop up immediately when their licence number is entered into a Google Image Search.\n\nOne way is to get an all-numeric licence plate. Because numbers show up in so many contexts, an all-numeric plate search will likely be diluted by other results, making your car harder \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to find.\n\nCounterintuitively, the same goes for personalised licence plates, too.\n\nFor example, I tried to search for this car\u2019s plate, which was a personalised plate that used a normal, English word with a number replacing a letter. This alternate version of the word was common enough that a search was flooded with other, unrelated examples, making any possible images of this Viper very difficult to find.\n\nLook, here\u2019s a DKW from the Lane Museum, found via its licence plate.\n\nAnecdotal reports have suggested that Facebook and Instagram do this as well, and we may as well go ahead and accept this as true. If Google is doing it, there\u2019s little reason to assume others aren\u2019t.\n\nI just checked a test I did on Facebook earlier today to see if they\u2019re reading and tagging licence plates, and, yep, it appears they are:\n\nSo, people can type your licence plate into Facebook and, if it\u2019s visible in any of your photos, it seems like it\u2019ll show up! Great for you budding stalkers out there!\n\nThe takeaway here is that you should just assume your licence plate is known and tagged to pictures of your car. Even if you obscure your plate in every image you yourself post, there\u2019s no way to know what images your car and its licence plate may be in the background of, meaning if it\u2019s not searchable yet, it likely will be.\n\nI suppose the positive side is that if you see a hit and run or someone\u2019s blocking you in, it\u2019s a lot easier to find out who\u2019s being the jerk. On the negative side, it\u2019s just a reminder that privacy in so many ways is eroding away, and there\u2019s damn little we can do about it.\n\nOh well. It\u2019s not like I was being particularly sneaky in my Pao, anyway.\n\nThis story first appeared on Jalopnik.", "description": "For years I\u2019ve gone back and forth over the practice of obscuring licence plates on photos on the internet.
