So if you haven\u2019t been feeling the love at your therapy sessions lately, it may be time to move on.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to leave someone who knows your deepest, darkest secrets. So, how do you let them go? And isn\u2019t it a pain to find someone new and catch them up to speed?\n\nThankfully, experts assure us that the process is doable. HuffPost chatted with a few mental health professionals on how to break up with your current therapist \u2015 and, most important, how to start over with someone new. Check out their tips below:\n\nTo start, figure out if your current therapist is a good match.\n\nVinodha Joly, a licensed psychotherapist with a private practice in Pleasanton, California, suggested asking yourself the following questions when assessing your current therapist: \u201cDo I feel understood?\u201d \u201cDo I experience the therapist as empathic, present, competent and nonjudgmental?\u201d \u201cAre there clearly stated goals in therapy and do I see positive movement towards these goals?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you answer any of the above questions in the negative, then it is a good idea to bring it up with the therapist directly, and if [you\u2019re] still not satisfied, then consider finding a new therapist,\u201d Joly said.\n\n\u201cIf you find that you are leaving most sessions feeling uncomfortable, dissatisfied, unseen or unheard, that\u2019s an indication that there\u2019s not a good fit.\u201d - Sharon Saline, licensed clinical psychologist\n\n\u201cIf you find that you are leaving most sessions feeling uncomfortable, dissatisfied, unseen or unheard, that\u2019s an indication that there\u2019s not a good fit,\u201d added Sharon Saline, a licensed clinical psychologist and author of What Your ADHD Child Wishes You Knew.\n\nAt end of the day, it\u2019s best to trust your gut. If you\u2019ve been attending regular sessions and aren\u2019t feeling it for whatever reason, it\u2019s likely time to move on.\n\n\u201cSometimes you simply know it\u2019s a bad match,\u201d explained Michele Blume, a clinical psychologist in Hermosa Beach, California.\n\nBreak up with your therapist if you feel he or she isn\u2019t the right fit.\n\nThe best way to end therapy is by being direct, according to Saline.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point to beating around the bush if you\u2019re not satisfied with what you\u2019re receiving from him or her,\u201d she said, noting that you don\u2019t have be confrontational but should aim to be clear about why things aren\u2019t working and your desire to move on.\n\nSaline said that most therapists will want to discuss this decision with you and try to make the changes you\u2019d like to see. But if that\u2019s not what you want, it\u2019s OK to politely decline sticking it out.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point to beating around the bush if you\u2019re not satisfied with what you\u2019re receiving from him or her.\u201d - Saline\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t just disappear on your therapist without warning. Give them some sort of notice before moving on.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ghost them. It would be a disservice to the therapist and to you,\u201d said Dori Gatter, a psychotherapist and relationship expert in West Hartford, Connecticut. She stressed that directly communicating to your therapist that you want to try someone new is \u201ca step into your own personal power\u201d and a means of achieving a healthy sense of closure.\n\nIn an ideal world, your therapist would probably like to have a final exit session before parting ways, according to Ramani Durvasula, a licensed clinical psychologist in Los Angeles and professor of psychology at California State University.\n\n\u201cIf you just want out, then get out, but if you just want a change in direction, then you can at least have a final session, re-cap some of your work and perhaps walk away with some recommendations,\u201d Durvasula explained.\n\njacoblund via Getty Images\n\nTake some time out in between therapists, then do a trial run.\n\n\u201dWhen a client leaves one therapist and considers going to work with another, it might be a good idea to consider taking a few weeks off from counseling to recharge the battery,\u201d said Patrick Di Vietri, director of therapy services at Hope Therapy and Wellness Center.\n\nHe explained that therapy can be a very draining process. When you transition from one therapist to another, he said, \u201cit can feel a lot like writing a 10-page paper, losing it and having to write it all over again.\u201d A break in between may help you enter into a new therapeutic alliance with a refreshed outlook.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to take your time when finding a replacement mental health professional. Blume suggested asking for a referral from friends or family members and really seeking out an expert that addresses your specific needs.\n\n\u201cYou want to leave your first session feeling as though you have a general understanding of how this new therapist works as well as having had the opportunity to communicate your needs.\u201d - Michele Blume, clinical psychologist\n\n\u201cYou want to leave your first session feeling as though you have a general understanding of how this new therapist works as well as having had the opportunity to communicate your needs. But just as important, you want to leave feeling that this is a safe person with whom [you] can share [your] deepest wounds and darkest parts,\u201d Blume said.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be afraid to try out several new therapists before committing to a standing weekly appointment.\n\n\u201cI encourage all of my first appointments to let me know that in the first session they are checking me out to see if I am a good fit for them,\u201d Gatter said. She added that finding a new therapist is a little like dating in that \u201cyou need to trust your gut and you will know when you have found \u2018the one.\u2019\u201d\n\nLook into \u2018shortcuts\u2019 that will catch your new therapist up to speed.\n\nStarting over with a new therapist generally involves reiterating your backstory. One way to avoid having to go all the way back in time is to sign a release of information, which allows your previous therapist to share his or her notes with your new therapist, according to Matt Smith, a therapist with Charlotte Counseling & Wellness.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one way at to pick up where you left off in your previous work,\u201d he explained, noting that this can save you from the hassle of having to dedicate several sessions to providing your background information to your new practitioner.\n\nThe downside to this option, Smith warned, is that your former therapist\u2019s notes may color your new therapist\u2019s impressions of your situation, which is not always ideal, especially if you\u2019re looking for a fresh start with a new therapist. But while giving your new therapist information on your family dynamic, career and background can be helpful, you don\u2019t always have to start at the beginning.\n\n\u201cI give my new clients the option of how they want to start,\u201d Blume said. \u201cIf they want to jump right in, great. If they want to start from the beginning, I can do that, too.\u201d\n\nBlume stressed that therapy is an organic unfolding and the client\u2019s needs determine this. So whatever you want to talk about with your new therapist is perfectly acceptable. And if your new therapist has information that they\u2019d like to know, they will eventually ask.\n\nCaiaimage/Rafal Rodzoch via Getty Images\n\nTell your new therapist what you want to get out of your sessions.\n\nOne thing that you should make clear in your first meeting is your treatment goals, Gatter said.\n\n\u201cTake a lead by letting the therapist know what you are looking for in a therapist, what issues you are looking to get help with, and asking any questions you may have of the therapist,\u201d Gatter explained. \u201cAs a therapist, I really like it when new clients come in and share all of this.\u201d\n\nWhen starting out with a new therapist, it\u2019s also a good idea to share specific previous therapy experiences, Smith added. This includes communicating what you liked and didn\u2019t like about your other sessions.\n\n\u201cAs a therapist, I always ask my clients about what\u2019s been helpful for them and what hasn\u2019t been so helpful in their work with other therapists so that I can I build on what\u2019s worked well for them in the past,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAdditionally, if your previous practitioner put you on any medications, you\u2019ll want to bring that up immediately to your new therapist. It\u2019s important to have the psychiatrist who prescribed your medication sign a release of information document to talk with your new therapist so they can coordinate your care, Gatter said.\n\n\u201cRelationships don\u2019t build over night and change takes awhile.\u201d - Blume\n\nMost important, be patient as your journey with a new professional begins. Success in therapy doesn\u2019t happen in one session.\n\n\u201cRelationships don\u2019t build over night and change takes awhile,\u201d Blume said. \u201cYou won\u2019t pick up with your new therapist where you left off with your last one. You will need some time to adjust and for your new therapist to get a handle on how you communicate and what your needs are.\u201d", "description": "Good news: You don't have to share your life story from the beginning.", "authors": ["Nicole Pajer", "On Assignment For Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d71705b2500001c13056458.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2018-07-24"}
