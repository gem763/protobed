And that certainly influences people\u2019s decision [to retire], whether they think they can regain the majority or not,\u201d said former Rep.

Tom Davis (R-Va.) said the notion of remaining in the minority is one factor driving the wave of GOP retirements, but it's hardly the only one.\n\nThe GOP base has shifted, he said, creating new power centers that are forcing once-comfortable lawmakers \u201cto have to hustle a little bit.\"\n\nHe also pointed to the simple question of finances, considering members of Congress have not received a pay increase in more than a decade.\n\nBut perhaps the most significant factor, Davis said, are the \"changing electoral patterns\" brought on by the rise of the populist movement that propelled Trump to the White House \u2014 an environment that is hardly unique to the United States.\n\n\u201cThe overall atmosphere in Washington is not very pleasant,\u201d said Davis, who previously led the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm. \"This is a global phenomenon caused by the rapidity of change, the instant communications, the rising expectations of those people who are unhappy with the change, who don't see [government] helping fast enough and who feel their status threatened.\"\n\nWhatever the cause, the number of retirements are piling up quickly.\n\nThis week, GOP Reps.

And as the retirement list has grown this summer, GOP lawmakers and aides are anxiously asking each other who might be next to go.\n\nAmong the names being floated around Washington are veteran establishment Republicans like Reps.

This is not meant to be a lifetime job.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s some disagreement about President Trump Donald John TrumpPompeo pressed on possible Senate run by Kansas media The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump digs in on Hurricane Dorian projection Trump's mental decline is perfectly clear for those with eyes to see and ears to hear MORE\u2019s role in the wave of retirements.\n\nPrivately, Republicans frequently grumble about having to respond to the latest presidential tweet, scandal or attack on sitting lawmakers. And outside observers say the chaos surrounding the White House is likely contributing to the departures.\n\n\u201cI don't think Republicans envision flipping the House in the near future and being in the minority is not fun,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, an expert in congressional history at Princeton University. \u201cSome are also tired of having to defend the party, not just in the era of Trump but in the era of the Tea Party. So the incentives increase to do something else.\"\n\nCurbelo, who represented a heavily Hispanic swing district in the Miami area, said Trump specifically played a role in his defeat to Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell Debbie Mucarsel-PowellSwing-seat Democrats oppose impeachment, handing Pelosi leverage Second Democrat representing Trump district backs impeachment The House Democrats who voted to kill impeachment effort MORE last year. And the controversial, all-consuming president may be why some of his old colleagues are calling it quits.\n\n\u201cTrump is a big part of it. Something Trump has done is take away Republicans\u2019 ability to have their own identity, so you\u2019re asked to compete every two years, and your record and your work have little to do with how people are going to vote. That has frustrated a lot of members as well,\u201d Curbelo told The Hill on Friday.\n\n\u201cMy work, my record was not really a relevant factor in 2018.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYet a number of Republicans eyeing the exits insist the president was not a factor in their decision.\n\nFlores, a former oil company executive elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave election, said he never intended to have a lifelong career in Washington. And with his parents now in their 80s and a newly-married son, Flores said his \u201cfamily situation\u201d made it a good time to leave Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic about opportunities for [the GOP] in 2020,\u201d Flores said in a phone interview Friday. \u201cWhen you boil down all the noise, you come up with a couple of key issues: Are people better off than they were four years ago? Most people would say yes. And do we want to go socialist? Most people would say no.\u201d\n\nStill, the departures mark a new challenge for GOP leaders and campaign operatives, who are fighting to flip the chamber but face a growing battlefield as their incumbency shrinks.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 campaign arm is cheering the trend, with 19 Republicans on its retirement watchlist.\n\nFormer Rep. Dennis Ross Dennis Alan RossIsrael should resist Trump's efforts to politicize support Pro-Saudi Arabia think tank abruptly closes in Washington The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by JUUL Labs - Trump attack on progressive Dems draws sharp rebuke MORE (R-Fla.), a senior member of the GOP whip team who retired last cycle, said another driver of the flurry of retirements is the grueling campaigning required to take back the majority.\n\nGOP leaders are pressing their members to raise money for the House GOP campaign operation and stump for candidates around the country, translating to more time away from home.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of work to get back to the majority,\u201d Ross told The Hill. \u201cIf they can\u2019t be everything the team wants them to to be, then they start thinking maybe it's time for someone else to do it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bad for the process to get fresh new people and fresh ideas in there.\u201d\n\n-- Jonathan Easley contributed from Austin, Texas.", "description": "A wave of House GOP retirements has created fresh headaches for party leaders, suggesting Republicans see little chance of winning back the chamber in 2020.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/retirements_floresbill_marchantkenny_olsonpete_conawaymichael_hurdwill_090619gn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
