The pizza will also be served in a round pizza box, which is industrially compostable and interlocks with other boxes for stability. After the event, the company says it\u2019ll look for more ways to roll out the box more widely in the future.\n\nThe round box was developed in partnership with Zume, an automated pizza delivery startup with a focus in sustainable practices. Compared to a normal, square pizza box, the round box uses less overall packaging. \u201cThis revolutionary round box\u2014the result of a two-year journey\u2014is the most innovative packaging we\u2019ve rolled out to date,\u201d said Pizza Hut chief customer and operations officer Nicolas Burquier. \u201cThe round box was engineered to make our products taste even better\u2014by delivering hotter, crispier pizzas.\u201d\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPizza boxes have always been square since it\u2019s cheaper to produce, as they can be made from a single sheet of cardboard. But that hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying to innovate. In 2004, an inventor named John Harvey created a round pizza box called the Presseal, which never quite caught on. And in 2010, Apple patented a round pizza box, which has been used in its employee cafeteria since.\n\nFast food companies like Burger King and KFC have been working with startups like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods to roll out fake meat versions of popular menu items, like the Beyond Fried Chicken and Impossible Whopper. Pizza Hut\u2019s Garden Specialty Pizza uses MorningStar Farms\u2019 Incogmeato Italian sausage, which parent company Kellogg launched just last month. Made from non-GMO soy, it too, bleeds like real meat like its competitors\u2019 products.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in trying out the limited-edition Incogmeato pizza, you can head over to the Phoenix Pizza Hut at 3602 E. Thomas Rd. on October 23rd at 11AM MT. The Garden Specialty Pizza and round pizza box will cost $10, and all proceeds will go to Arizona Forward, a Phoenix-based sustainability nonprofit.", "description": "Pizza hut is partnering with Zume, an automated pizza delivery startup, to develop compostable round pizza boxes.
