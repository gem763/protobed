Greg at the garage outside his house. Photo: Michelle Groskopf\n\nSince February, the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration has given 130 individuals \u2014 randomly selected from neighborhoods with a median household income at or below Stockton\u2019s of $46,033 \u2014 monthly payments of $500, no strings attached. The disbursements are part of an 18-month pilot program studying the effects of a universal basic income (UBI). Since February, I have followed five of the recipients to watch how this unexpected windfall has changed their lives.\n\nMonth One \u201c I h a v e n \u2019 t b e e n r e a l l y g e t t i n g a n y w h e r e . J u s t b e e n w o r k i n g . T r y i n g t o m a k e p l a n s b u t n e v e r f o l l o w t h r o u g h w i t h t h e p l a n . \u201d\n\nThe day before the first $500 installment hits, I meet Greg at his house on the north side of Stockton. Small ranch homes with three-car garages line the street. Cars pack the driveways, one behind the other, suggesting households with too many adults in them. We were supposed to meet elsewhere, but Greg\u2019s car is leaking brake fluid and he barely made it home from work. When I arrive, the 1999 white Integra is sitting in the driveway with its hood up.\n\nGreg comes out in jeans and a dark T-shirt. He has a short goatee, and his face is covered in freckles, which make him look younger than his 30 years. His head is shaved, and he rubs it a lot when he talks. Later, he\u2019ll tell me he has gray hairs from stressing too much. Greg has four kids, two girls and two boys, who range in age from 2 to 8.\n\nWe drive to a park and talk in my rental car. Greg tells me he\u2019s going to try to sell the Integra tonight because he doesn\u2019t want to bother fixing it. He has been saving up for a new car, an older BMW for $1,100. \u201cIt\u2019s tagged and smogged and good to go,\u201d he says. He just needs his $500 tomorrow morning and somebody to drive him. Greg plans to use future SEED disbursements to pay off his debts. \u201cSo by next year, I\u2019ll be able to possibly get me and my kids a house or something like that. Get us going instead of just the same cycle going over and over again.\u201d\n\nHe and the two older kids have lived at his mom\u2019s for the past five years. She takes them to school and helps with their homework. He sees his other two kids, born to two different girlfriends, on the weekends. He has been working full time at a salvage lot, where he makes a bit more than minimum wage and even gets four paid holidays. \u201cIt\u2019s a job I\u2019ve been trying to get for years,\u201d he says. He can get a discount for any car parts he needs. He can also buy really cheaply any of the stuff that comes inside the cars \u2014 gaming systems, laptops, cameras \u2014 people\u2019s whole lives sometimes, before their vehicle got repossessed or they sold it with everything inside. His job is to clean the cars and drain all the fluids before the customers pick them for parts. The hardest job is cleaning out cars that people have been living in. \u201cThere\u2019s urine on clothes, feces.\u201d\n\nCompared with what he\u2019s been through, Greg\u2019s life now is relatively stable. When he was growing up, both his parents worked, but his father kept blowing their money buying fixer-upper cars that he never got around to fixing up. They divorced when Greg was in fifth grade, but even before the split was official, his dad had drifted in and out of his life, upsetting any stability his mom managed to achieve. There were stints on welfare and living in hotels that catered to residents who couldn\u2019t afford a security deposit, and even a spell in a homeless shelter. When I suggest that this upbringing sounds pretty rough, Greg shrugs. \u201cWhen you\u2019re used to stuff, you\u2019re used to stuff, you know.\u201d\n\nHe started working his senior year in high school, mostly part-time minimum-wage jobs with no benefits. When he married in 2009, he and his wife moved with his brother and mom into a place their dad had found. Before long, Greg\u2019s wife was pregnant. He started taking college classes online through Everest College, working toward an associate\u2019s degree in crime-scene investigation. The ads practically guaranteed a job with starting salaries at $30,000. \u201cI was shocked that I passed my classes with C\u2019s,\u201d Greg says. \u201cFor my first time going to college, I was like, That\u2019s pretty good.\u201d\n\nHe and his brother had been paying their father the rent every month, but their dad wasn\u2019t passing the money along to the landlord. They got kicked out. \u201cEverything just collapsed,\u201d Greg says, \u201cand there was no time to do school at all.\u201d They ended up at the same hotel where he\u2019d lived as a kid. That one semester of college left him with nearly $9,000 of student-loan debt. Three years later, California brought a suit against the network of for-profit colleges of which Everest was a part for deceiving students with inflated job-\u00adplacement promises and degrees of little value, winning a $1.2 billion settlement. But Greg still owes the amount he borrowed. Loan-relief programs don\u2019t apply to him because he never graduated.\n\nThe lowest point came a year later. Greg\u2019s housing fell apart yet again. His father was fixing vehicles on a ranch and said he could get Greg on the payroll. Greg packed up his young family and moved out there, but there wasn\u2019t much work. \u201cI had to wait a month just to get paid one check.\u201d He had his daughter to feed and a brand-new baby boy to take care of. They applied for welfare. When it came through, his wife took off. \u201cShe left me and the kids without nothing, the cash or the food stamps. We were starving.\u201d\n\nEventually, he made his way back to Stockton, divorced his wife, and gained custody of their kids. He\u2019s done with his dad, too. His last words for Greg, sent in a text, were: \u201cIt\u2019s every man for himself.\u201d Greg laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s literally what he wrote.\u201d\n\nHe hopes the SEED program can help get him and his kids more established. \u201cI haven\u2019t been really getting anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cJust been working. Trying to make plans but never follow through with the plan.\u201d He says he just tries to keep his head clear. \u201cAnd take care of my kids the best that I can. Show them that I\u2019m here at least.\u201d\n\nThe next day, I go with Greg to buy the BMW from a guy about his father\u2019s age. He takes it for a test-drive, speeding down the empty streets, remarking at how well it hugs the curves. When he brings it back, he and the seller trade compliments about the German engineering, then Greg counts out the hundred-dollar bills into the man\u2019s hand. \u201cGreenbacks,\u201d the man says. \u201cIt feels good.\u201d\n\nMonth Two G r e g h a d t o l d m e t h a t h e s t a y s a w a y f r o m c a r n o t e s , b u t h e d e c i d e d t o u s e t h e $ 5 0 0 f r o m S E E D t o c o v e r t h e m o n t h l y a u t o p a y m e n t .\n\nI talk to Greg on the phone a week after he receives his second installment. The BMW is gone, sold for $700 less than he paid for it, because the car\u2019s paperwork wasn\u2019t in order. \u201cNobody wants to deal with it,\u201d he says sheepishly. He got the Integra running again, but then he got into an accident. Everyone was all right, but the car was wrecked. Luckily, he\u2019d just picked out a 2011 Camaro from a used-car lot, which he is planning on getting tomorrow.\n\nGreg had told me that he stays away from car notes, but after talking with his girlfriend, he decided to use the $500 from SEED to cover the monthly auto payment of $415. \u201cI don\u2019t want no more projects,\u201d he says. The Camaro will be the nicest car he has ever owned. He thinks it might open some doors for him. His friend\u2019s sister knows about a job as an orderly at a hospital, and the right candidate would have to have a reliable car. And paying on the car note should help improve his credit.\n\nMonth Four \u201c M y m i n d r u n s w i l d w i t h i t . I t \u2019 s j u s t s h o o t i n g s t r a i g h t u p t i l l i t \u2019 s g o n e . I t \u2019 s l i k e , \u2018 O h , y o u c o u l d e n d u p w i t h n o t h i n g . \u2019 \u2019\n\nI wait in my rental car in a park. Greg pulls up in the Camaro. It\u2019s gray and muscly, and he revs it a second before he turns it off. When he gets out, I\u2019m taken aback by his appearance. He has lost about 25 pounds, and his face looks lined and haggard. He\u2019s just come from the doctor\u2019s office, where he had an X-ray done of his neck. He\u2019s been experiencing a strange tingling down it lately.\n\nTwo months ago, he started feeling nauseated, and since then he\u2019s been in and out of the doctor\u2019s, trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with him. As we talk, we walk on the path running along the perimeter of the park. Greg is walking fast, and I have to jog every few steps to keep up with him. He tells me he has been having aches and pains, headaches. \u201cNot in the mood to eat anything,\u201d he says. When he gets home from work, he just sits on his bed and watches YouTube or does nothing at all.\n\nI wonder if anyone has suggested he might be depressed. \u201cIt could be that. Depression and anxiety. It all weighs down on me,\u201d he says. He\u2019ll typically start thinking about a bill and what will happen if he doesn\u2019t pay it. \u201cMy mind runs wild with it. It\u2019s just shooting straight up till it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you could end up with nothing.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still trying to get out of that cycle,\u201d he says, running his hand up the back of his head. \u201cI\u2019ve got to stop buying so many cars.\u201d It\u2019s been a pattern for years. He\u2019ll buy a car he likes or thinks is a good price, then once he drives it a few times, he starts to lose interest. But he\u2019s not like his father. \u201cHe was an idiot,\u201d says Greg. \u201cHe didn\u2019t take care of his bills first.\u201d Besides the Camaro, Greg has bought another BMW and a Honda Civic. He shares that he\u2019s been regretting buying the Camaro, because he thinks it was overpriced. \u201cBut my girl talked me into it, and I talked myself into it. So it\u2019s either deal with it or take it back in and deal with the bad credit.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI already got bad credit. It\u2019s gonna be worse.\u201d\n\nDoes he think he would have found financial-literacy classes helpful? It\u2019s a suggestion many people make when discussing giving money to those who don\u2019t have a lot of it. \u201cI know how to handle my money,\u201d Greg says, sounding indignant. He just does stupid things sometimes. \u201cAnd I try to have a little fun.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t believe the SEED money led him to buy more cars. It has given him more stability, he says. \u201cI mean, shoot, if I didn\u2019t have it, I\u2019d be coming out of pocket and wouldn\u2019t have \u2014 \u201d He pauses for a minute. \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t have a Camaro, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d The way he says this, I don\u2019t know if he thinks that would have been a good thing or a bad thing.\n\nMonth Seven P a r t o f t h e p o i n t o f m a k i n g b a s i c i n c o m e u n i v e r s a l i s f o r t h e g o v e r n m e n t t o g e t o u t o f t h e b u s i n e s s o f s o r t i n g t h e p o p u l a t i o n i n t o t h e d e s e r v i n g a n d t h e u n d e s e r v i n g .\n\nI stand in Greg\u2019s driveway, watching over his shoulder as he leans under the dashboard of his new 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse to install a stereo he just bought from his friend. There\u2019s a 1994 Civic in the driveway that he\u2019s fixing up to sell. He has bought and sold a couple more Integras and another Civic or two, probably ten cars in all since the beginning of the year. But the Camaro\u2019s gone. He had to eat his $2,500 deposit and the two months of payments he made. If they can\u2019t sell the car for his outstanding loan amount, he\u2019ll have to pay the difference for that, too.\n\nBut he\u2019s happy to have gotten rid of the payment. He\u2019s eating again and has regained the weight he lost and then some. \u201cAs soon as I can make some space in the garage, I want to get back to lifting weights like I did in high school,\u201d he says.\n\nHe looks up and smiles. His expression no longer looks as if he\u2019s staring down the edge of a cliff. \u201cI stopped thinking about things all the time,\u201d he explains when I ask what changed. \u201cWhen I do think about stuff, I try not to let it get to me.\u201d He\u2019ll put on music or watch a funny video. Or he\u2019ll go outside and tinker with one of his cars. \u201cI just went back to doing what I was doing, focusing on work.\u201d\n\nAt the salvage lot, he has almost made it through the worst of the summer heat. The temperature has been hovering around 110 degrees for the past few days. He labors in the direct sun in long-sleeved protective gear and has to drink water every half-hour. I ask if he ever looks at the weather report and thinks he doesn\u2019t want to go to work the next morning. \u201cEvery damn day,\u201d he says. But he got a raise of $3 an hour, so now he\u2019s making $16. Between the extra income and the SEED money, he can get his kids clothes, tablets, shoes, and games. Whatever they might need.\n\nHe twists the radio\u2019s wires and shoves it back into the cavity, then turns the knob. Nothing. \u201cOh man,\u201d he says, sitting back onto the Mitsubishi\u2019s black leather seats. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot to do this now anyway.\u201d\n\nWe drive over to the park across the avenue and sit on a bench in the shade, and I ask every question I can think of to try to understand what buying and selling all these cars means to him. \u201cIs it fun when you buy a car?\u201d I ask. \u201cDo you get a little excited?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt depends on what it is. If it\u2019s gonna be like a commuter, I\u2019m not tripping. But, like, this car here\u201d \u2014 he nods over to the Eclipse \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m excited by this one.\u201d It didn\u2019t look like that when he got it. \u201cThe light was busted, and it was sitting on a donut.\u201d He got new tires and fixed the headlight. \u201cI want to get it finished\u2014painting, everything 100 percent.\u201d He\u2019s planning on keeping this one for a long time, he says.\n\nI ask Greg if he\u2019s up or down this year from his car sales. He thinks for a minute. \u201cI might have made a little bit more or broke even,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d I say, reminding him about the Camaro and the BMW. \u201cShoot, I take that back now.\u201d He pauses a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s how it is,\u201d he says, looking across the park and then back at me. \u201cYeah, so I lost.\u201d\n\nI tell Greg how much I appreciate his willingness to spend hours with a total stranger, sharing every last detail of his personal business. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the program.\u201d\n\nLike all the other recipients I talk to, Greg wants the program to succeed. And SEED\u2019s success will depend to some degree on whether the general public thinks Greg and the other recipients did \u201cgood things\u201d with their money. But part of the point of making basic income universal is for the government to get out of the business of sorting the population into the deserving and the undeserving, categories that have been wrought and cast by racism. Greg has his own qualms about just giving money to people who don\u2019t want to work. In the park, he tells me, \u201cNobody can say that I\u2019m lazy. Nobody can say that I\u2019m not providing for my kids. Nobody can say anything to me about anything. I might have like ten different cars a month, but I still take care of my business, so nobody can take none of that from me.\u201d\n\nThis project was supported by a grant from the investigative news site Capital & Main.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the October 14, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
