The call shows Trump asking Zelenskiy to look into alleged corruption in Ukraine by Biden and his son Hunter, setting off a Democratic-led House impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nTrump reacted Sunday to news of a second whistleblower with a flurry of tweets, repeating unproven claims of corruption by the Bidens. \"The Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple. The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable,\" Trump said.\n\nHe has alleged that when Joe Biden was vice president, he threatened to hold up loan guarantees to Ukraine unless it fired a prosecutor investigating a gas company on which Hunter Biden had a seat.\n\nTrump also accuses Hunter Biden of taking $1.5 billion from China \"for no apparent reason\" and has publically called on China to investigate the Bidens. \"There is NO WAY these can be legitimate transactions? As lawyers & others have stated as President I have an OBLIGATION to look into possible or probable CORRUPTION,\" he tweeted.\n\nNo evidence of corruption by the Bidens in Ukraine or China has been found.\n\n", "description": "2nd Whistleblower Comes Forward in Trump-Ukraine Scandal", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/07/2019100700552_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
