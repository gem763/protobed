REUTERS/Arnd WIegmann/File Photo\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has urged Bern to wrap up the accord before his term ends on Oct. 31, when German politician Ursula von der Leyen is set to replace him.\n\nThe Swiss government has also said it would like to clinch a deal by then if three final points can be clarified.\n\nEconomy Minister Guy Parmelin, however, told the SonntagsZeitung newspaper that he was pessimistic, given that representatives of Swiss labor, employers and cantons had been unable to find common ground Switzerland could use in the talks.\n\n\u201cWe want a good solution that can win majority support, and that is not the case at the moment,\u201d said Parmelin, a member of the right-wing and euroskeptic Swiss People\u2019s Party.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can wrap up this year. Our agenda and that of the EU allow a conclusion only next year at the earliest,\u201d he said, citing Swiss elections in October, the creation of a new European Commission team and a Swiss referendum due next year on abolishing free movement of EU citizens.\n\nBrussels blocked EU-based investors from trading on Swiss exchanges from July 1 as the row escalated over the treaty under which non-member Switzerland would routinely adopt the EU single market rules. The Swiss retaliated by banning EU venues from hosting Swiss stock trading.\n\nIn Bern, resistance to the treaty \u2014 negotiated over 4-1/2 years and Switzerland\u2019s top foreign policy issue \u2014 encompasses the normally pro-Europe center-left to the anti-EU far right, which both see the pact infringing Swiss sovereignty.\n\nFailure to secure a treaty deal with its biggest trading partner means Switzerland gets no new access to the single market, its crucial export outlet. The partners have 120 bilateral economic accords that would stay in place but erode over time when they are not updated. Research cooperation could also stop.\n\n\u201cI think the EU would weaken itself if it no longer cooperated with Switzerland on research,\u201d Parmelin said.\n\n\u201cWe are then forced to seek alternatives, perhaps along with Britain, if the EU remains dogmatic.\u201d\n\nParmelin played down a Swiss media report that he would urge post-Brexit Britain to join the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which groups together Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. He said some Swiss politicians liked the idea but the Swiss cabinet had not discussed it.\n\n\u201cI have not heard that this is needed by Britain. If Britons want that, we will review it, but I believe it would be risky,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven its size, Britain would dominate the rest of EFTA.\u201d", "description": "Switzerland is unlikely to strike a deal with the European Union this year over a stalled partnership treaty, its economy minister said, extending an impasse that has hurt bilateral ties and disrupted cross-border share trading.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190901&t=2&i=1425048313&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF801JP-OCABS"}
