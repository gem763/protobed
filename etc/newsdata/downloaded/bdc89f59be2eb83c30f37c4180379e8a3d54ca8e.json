(Photo: HBO)\n\nHBO\u2019s His Dark Materials, based on the Philip Pullman books, may be a high-concept fantasy series about a mysterious dust that connects all realities, but it\u2019s not without its own connection to our world. As explained by star Lin-Manuel Miranda, it\u2019s about people in authority abusing their power to control others... including taking children away from their parents.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Miranda (who plays Lee Scoresby) shared more about his personal fandom of His Dark Materials \u2014 something he previously mentioned during the show\u2019s San Diego Comic-Con panel \u2014 having read the series \u201cmany times\u201d and shared them with his wife while he was filming Mary Poppins Returns.\n\nBut here, the interviewer asked him about something different: how the books may have a \u201cdifferent impact\u201d now than they did back then. Miranda\u2019s response was stark and distressing.\n\n\u201cI wish that the images of children being separated from their parents didn\u2019t echo what is currently happening in our country,\u201d he said.\n\nHis Dark Materials has a timeless quality, taking place across countless strange worlds (with only one of them being our own), but that doesn\u2019t mean its subject material doesn\u2019t reflect what we\u2019re going through in 2019.\n\nThe first book focuses on \u201cThe Gobblers,\u201d boogeymen blamed for the disappearance of dozens of kids \u2014 namely orphans, gypsies and other children from disenfranchised groups. The gypsies take it upon themselves to find their lost children, because the theocratic and authoritarian government isn\u2019t doing anything to stop it. Without giving too much away, let\u2019s just say there\u2019s a reason why.\n\nEvery parent fears having their child taken from them \u2014 it\u2019s a universal horror. But it\u2019s especially pertinent in the United States right now as reports continue to surface of immigrant children being forcibly separated from their parents at the border and placed with others without the parents\u2019 consent.\n\nThere are still thousands of separated children and it\u2019s having lasting impacts on these families. For example, a report from the Associated Press showed that the Trump administration is not prioritising reuniting parents with their children who\u2019ve been given to \u201csponsors,\u201d meaning foster or adoptive services.\n\nMiranda also discussed the book\u2019s message about the dangers of trying to control people\u2019s bodies, another situation that continues to play out in our own government with the array of anti-abortion laws and other regulations designed to limit body autonomy. In short: It doesn\u2019t matter what world or reality we\u2019re in, it still manages to suck really bad.\n\nHis Dark Materials debuts on BBC November 4, and is set to appear on FOX Showcase in Australia.", "description": "HBO\u2019s His Dark Materials, based on the Philip Pullman books, may be a high-concept fantasy series about a mysterious dust that connects all realities, but it\u2019s not without its own connection to our world.
