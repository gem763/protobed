Otherwise, Baig recommended waiting \u201canother cycle or two, when Apple will perhaps cook up something to truly blow you away.\u201d\n\nUSA Today wasn\u2019t the only one to rave about the iPhone 11\u2019s battery life: The Wall Street Journal praised the new phone\u2019s ability to last through a whole day of heavy usage.\n\nsource Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe Journal\u2019s Joanna Stern commended Apple for finally making its latest iPhones \u201cwork when we damn well need them to\u201d by giving the iPhone 11 longer battery life. Stern said that after a full day of using the iPhone pretty heavily, it was at 15% by 11:30 p.m.\n\nAdditionally, Stern wrote a second review in which she recommended the new iPhone 11 for anyone who has been putting off upgrading their iPhone for a while, especially those still holding on to an iPhone 6.\n\nMeanwhile, TechCrunch focused on the iPhone 11\u2019s cameras, especially the new night-mode feature designed to take vivid, high-quality pictures at night.\n\nsource Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nIn a now customary move in reviewing new iPhone models, TechCrunch\u2019s editor-in-chief, Matthew Panzarino, took the new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland for his review.\n\nAbove all, he praised the iPhone 11\u2019s night mode, an automatic feature that kicks in to change low-light pictures \u201cfrom throw away images to something well worth keeping.\u201d\n\nPanzarino also talked up the new iPhone 11 cameras, saying they \u201copened up possibilities for shooting that haven\u2019t been on iPhone before,\u201d especially when it came to taking wide-angle portraits and improved portrait-mode shots.\n\nLauren Goode at Wired concluded that although the iPhone 11 \u201cis not the most innovative smartphone available\u201d on the market, it\u2019s the best option for anyone putting off an iPhone upgrade.\n\nGoode argued that the iPhone 11 was \u201cplaying catch-up\u201d with a two-lens rear camera on par with its Android competitors.\n\nGoode also said the iPhone 11 felt faster in its actions and touches than previous models.\n\nAnd like other reviewers, Goode found that battery life was a key component of the new iPhone 11.\n\nCNET summed up its review by calling the iPhone 11 the best \u201cmidtier\u201d phone out there, with Apple prioritizing key components like speed and battery over flashier features.\n\nCNET\u2019s Scott Stein said in his review that the iPhone 11 was made for \u201ceveryday function,\u201d acting as a more solid choice than futuristic devices like 5G-enabled or foldable phones.\n\nStein focused on the increased battery life and better-quality cameras, and night mode in particular.", "description": "Business Insider - Apple will start shipping its new iPhone 11 on Friday, but the phones have already been in the hands of tech reviewers..
