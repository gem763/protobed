Kelly,\" which documented several sexual abuse accusations against the 52-year-old singer, Gaga took a stand against him.\n\n\"I stand behind these women 1000%, believe them, know they are suffering and in pain, and feel strongly that their voices should be heard and taken seriously,\" the 33-year-old wrote in a statement posted to her Twitter account. \"What I am hearing about the allegations against R Kelly is absolutely horrifying and indefensible.x\n\nMore: Lady Gaga pulls R.
