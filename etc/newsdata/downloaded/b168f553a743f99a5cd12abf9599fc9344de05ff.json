She came to me, as many people do, because conventional medicine failed her. You see, four years ago at the age of 55, she started experiencing pain, soreness, and stiffness in her joints\u2014especially in her knees and fingers. All hallmark signs of osteoarthritis, her doctor suggested that she take over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Of course they didn\u2019t provide much relief at all, so she got a stronger, prescription-strength\n\nJoints 101\n\nNSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) . It worked for a while and Terry returned to life as normal. But after a few years, another problem struck. She developed an ulcer. Not surprising at all, considering gastrointestinal issues (along with heart attack and stroke) are common side effects of long-term NSAID use. She found herself back at her doctor\u2019s office yet again, but this time, she received less-than-stellar service from him: \u201cWell, you could try some supplements, but those probably won\u2019t work. Other than that, there\u2019s not much more I can do for you.\u201d Terry was at her wit\u2019s end. She was upset with her doctor, who blew off her arthritis as just another \u201cannoying problem\u201d you have to live with as you get older. And because she stopped taking painkillers due to her ulcer , she was in a lot of discomfort. I convinced Terry that her situation was not as hopeless as she thought. Contrary to what her doctor told her, supplementswork. Unlike pain meds, which simply cover up symptoms, targeted nutrients can actually repair joints. To understand how this happens, let me give you a quick anatomy lesson.Cartilage is the rubbery tissue the covers the ends of your bones. It acts much like a shock absorber, preventing your bones from grinding against each other. Joint cartilage is made of mostly water and chondrocytes. Chondrocytes are specialized cells that produce collagen and elastin fibers (which give cartilage its strength and structural integrity), and proteoglycans (proteins involved in keeping the joints lubricated and nourished). As we age, our chondrocytes don\u2019t function as efficiently. As a result, old or damaged cartilage breaks down faster than it can be replaced with fresh, new cartilage. (Injuries and excess weight also put a tremendous amount of stress on cartilage, causing quick deterioration as well.) With less of this spongy cushioning between the joints, bones press against each other and pain follows. NSAIDs and other medications will never treat or cure arthritis. They simply relieve the aches and pains so that you can get through your day. (And as Terry can attest, the side effects can be terrible.) But there are extremely safe and effective drug-free approaches to healing your aching joints.\n\nJoint-Friendly Nutrients\n\nGlucosamine and chondroitin is the \u201cgold standard\u201d combination when it comes to joint repair. Glucosamine sulfate helps boost the production of complex carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), the building blocks of cartilage. Glucosamine also keeps collagen and elastin fibers moist and lubricated so that nutrients can be delivered to cartilage. Chondroitin sulfate works much the same way, but it has the added benefit of inhibiting the enzymes that degrade cartilage.\n\nis the \u201cgold standard\u201d combination when it comes to joint repair.

Curcumin, the medicinal component in the herb turmeric, has been found to prevent the breakdown of cartilage. Additional research also has shown that curcumin provides potent pain relief without the gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nthe medicinal component in the herb turmeric, has been found to prevent the breakdown of cartilage.

MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) is a naturally occurring sulfur compound and a component of connective tissue. Studies reveal that it can improve pain, mobility, and inflammation\u2014with even stronger benefits if taken along with glucosamine.\n\nis a naturally occurring sulfur compound and a component of connective tissue.

Vitamin D , believe it or not,plays a pretty big role in joint health. A deficiency has been linked to the progression of arthritis, especially of the knee.\n\n, believe it or not,plays a pretty big role in joint health. A deficiency has been linked to the progression of arthritis, especially of the knee. Boswellia (also known as Indian Frankincense) is an herbal extract that can alleviate inflammation related to arthritis. It also has been shown to improve pain and function within as little as five days of use.\n\nSome nutritional supplements work by giving your body the raw materials it needs to rebuild cartilage. Others either stop its breakdown, or preserve the cartilage you already have. Either way, the long-term result is less pain and healthier joints.\n\nCollagen Boosters\n\nFinally, a very recent study revealed that a powerful anti-inflammatory threesome\u2014Devil\u2019s claw, turmeric (whose active component is curcumin), and bromelain\u2014can provide significant immediate and long-term relief from arthritis pain\u2014with little to no worries about side effects. The authors even said that these nutrients \u201cmay be a valuable and safe alternative to NSAIDs in patients suffering from degenerative joint diseases.\u201dOne of the cheapest and easiest ways to boost collagen around your joints is to make your own bone broth using animal bones and crustacean/egg shells. These dinner scraps happen to be some of the best sources of glucosamine, chondroitin, various amino acids, and hyaluronic acid\u2014which acts as a joint cushion and lubricant. Making homemade bone broth could not be any easier. Simply place the bones and shells in a pot and cover with water. Add one to two tablespoons of lemon juice or vinegar of your choice for every quart of water. Simmer for up to 12 hours, then cool and strain the liquid. An alternative to bone broth is a supplement called UC-II (undenatured type II collagen), which is derived from chicken bones. A solid body of research reveals that it can rebuild cartilage, relieve arthritic pain, improve mobility and extension, and enhance quality of life. A final option is gelatin. I\u2019m not talking about the sugar-laden, artificially flavored product you find in the dessert aisle of the grocery store. Rather, unflavored, unmodified gelatin is nothing more than collagen processed from animals\u2019 bones, hides, and connective tissues. I highly recommend a brand called Great Lakes Gelatin, which you can find online. If you\u2019re a frustrated arthritis sufferer like Terry, please try these natural treatments. They\u2019re your best options for long-lasting relief from pain and inflammation.", "description": "A few weeks ago, I met with a new patient .09/02/2019 3:14:41AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
