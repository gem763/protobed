I said they\u2019re going to have to fight a little while,\u201d Trump told a rally of supporters in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\u201cLike two kids in a lot, you have got to let them fight and then you pull them apart.\n\n\u201cThey fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious.\u201d\n\nTrump triggered the week-long Turkish offensive against the Kurds by withdrawing US troops from northeast Syria.\n\nMore than 500 people have been killed, including dozens of civilians, mostly on the Kurdish side, and 300,000 civilians have been displaced within Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.\n\nTrump stressed that \u201cnot one drop of American blood\u201d was shed.\n\nEarlier he hailed the announcement that Turkey had agreed to suspend its offensive, calling it a \u201cgreat day\u201d for the Turks and the Kurds.\n\n\u201cWe have a five-day ceasefire,\u201d Trump told reporters, after Vice President Mike Pence said Ankara had agreed to suspend its military operation, and end it entirely once Kurdish fighters withdraw from a safe zone along the Turkey-Syria border.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the United States,\u201d the president said in Fort Worth, Texas, ahead of a re-election rally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great day for Turkey,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the Kurds. It\u2019s a great day for civilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where everybody\u2019s happy,\u201d he declared.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Obscene and ignorant\u2019 \u2013\n\nTrump also heaped praise on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and said it would no longer be necessary to impose US sanctions on Turkey.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a hell of a leader,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe did the right thing.\u201d\n\nTrump has come under bipartisan fire in Washington for abruptly pulling US troops in Syria near the Turkish border, paving the way for Ankara\u2019s operation against the Kurds, who have been US allies in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nBrett McGurk, former presidential special envoy for the anti-IS coalition, described Trump\u2019s remarks about \u201ctwo kids\u201d fighting as \u201cobscene and ignorant.\u201d\n\n\u201c200k innocent people displaced. Hundreds dead. Credible reports of war crimes. ISIS prisoners escaping. US evacuating and bombing its own positions or handing them to Russia. Two kids in a lot?\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nThe agreement struck by Pence also left some lawmakers in Washington, including in Trump\u2019s Republican Party, unimpressed.\n\n\u201cOther than giving Kurds a chance to leave so they don\u2019t get slaughtered, it doesn\u2019t sound like a change of any of the other dynamics I\u2019m concerned about,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, who hours earlier unveiled legislation that would impose sharp sanctions on Turkey, said that while he was encouraged by the recent developments between Pence and Erdogan, \u201cwe\u2019re going to keep working\u201d to get the sanctions bill to the Senate floor for a vote.\n\nTurkey and Syrian rebel proxies began an offensive in northern Syria last week against Kurdish fighters who Ankara brands terrorists, despite international concern over regional stability and civilian deaths.\n\nAnkara considers Syrian Kurdish YPG militants to be an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) \u2014 a group that has fought a bloody insurgency inside Turkey for 35 years.", "description": "Dallas (AFP) \u2013 US President Donald Trump Thursday welcomed the temporary ceasefire in northern Syria and said he allowed Turkish and Kurdish forces", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/202755_donald-trump-turkey-kurds-needed-fight-two-kids-in-lot-you-got-let-fight-you-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
