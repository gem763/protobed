Those outages followed a similar pattern: social media was unavailable at first before a wider internet blackout across the entire country.\n\nIraqi authorities have not commented on the blackout.", "description": "Monitor says \u2018intentional restrictions\u2019 by major providers have caused near-blackout", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Baghdad"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44ade73b932736f4658740d584c21dd88488c240/0_250_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=17b3dfd245cfb7f1517fbd7f55f30c42"}
