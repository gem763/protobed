But this is not true. They are already present in America. Can\u2019t believe it? Please take a look at the chart below.\n\nChart 1: Yields on the US 10-Year Inflation-Indexed Treasury in 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one can see, the yield on the U.S. 10-year inflation-indexed Treasury has dived below zero at the turn of August and September. Hence, although nominal interest rates are still positive in America, the real interest rates have turned negative for a while recently. By the way, the chart also shows that the real bond yields have been gradually declining in 2019 until September, which boosted the gold prices.\n\nBut why is the fall of real interest rates into negative territory so important? Well, more generally, everything that relates to the real interest rates should be of great interest to precious metals investors. This is because of the very strong negative correlation between the real interest rates and gold. It means that the gold prices tend to move in the opposite direction to real interest rates, as it is illustrated by the chart below.\n\nChart 2: Gold prices (yellow line, right axis, London P.M. Fix, in $) and yields on the US 10-Year Inflation-Indexed Treasury (green line, left axis, in %) from January 2003 to September 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nMore specifically, the previous two times when the 10-year TIPS yield went negative, the price of the yellow metal peaked. Just take one more look at the chart above. Last time when the real interest rates proxy went negative was in July 2016, which coincided with a medium-term peak in the gold prices. This is because the TIPS bottomed and reversed their trend soon after they dipped into negative territory. As real interest rates rallied, the yellow metal struggled.\n\nThe second case of the TIPS going negative occurred in August 2011, which coincided with a historical peak in gold prices. Interestingly, the real interest rate continued to trend downward for several months after the gold price peaked. It indicates that either other (perhaps technical) factors prevented the yellow metal from rallying further or that the following slide in the real interest rates was already factored into the gold prices.", "description": "Many believe that negative interest rates will never arrive to the United States.
