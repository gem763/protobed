It was the most avoidable mass murder in American history. And last week, Governor Gavin Newsom just forced into every school in California the policies that made it inevitable.\n\nThe Parkland shooter was a known-wolf. Before the massacre was over, students knew who did it. He was considered so dangerous when he attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that school administrators banned him from bringing a backpack and frisked him every day for fear that he\u2019d bring a deadly weapon.\n\nEven though security staff brought him to the principal\u2019s office all the time, his disciplinary record looked pretty clean on paper. If he had been arrested at school for his crimes, maybe the FBI could have followed through on tips that he would shoot up the school. And if he\u2019d been disciplined for his sub-criminal misbehavior, maybe school administrators could have made a strong case for sending him back to a specialized school for disturbed students, where he so badly needed to be.\n\nBut the Broward County school district had embarked on a quest to fight the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d by lowering suspensions, expulsions, and arrests. And school principals responded by systematically sweeping disturbing behavior under the rug. If one individual in the Broward school district made one responsible decision about the killer, the tragedy could have been averted. But you can\u2019t even call what happened a \u201cfailure,\u201d because each obviously irresponsible decision makes perfect sense given the policies.\n\nThe state of California has just lurched far harder on leniency than Broward, by banning suspensions and expulsions for nonviolent offenses.\n\nDon\u2019t you dare think that in practice this leniency won\u2019t extend to violence, though. In Broward, 52 percent of teachers fear for their safety. Twenty-four percent have been threatened. Thirteen percent have been assaulted. And only 39 percent think that a student would be suspended if he assaulted them.\n\nBeyond leading to an increase in school violence and risk of deadly catastrophe, these leniency policies are profoundly bad for learning and for character. We know what happens when schools ban suspension.\n\nIn Philadelphia, math proficiency declined by three percentage points, and reading proficiency by seven. Truancy skyrocketed from about 25 percent to over 40 percent, perhaps because even as suspensions for nonviolent offenses fell, suspensions for serious offenses rose.\n\nEducation researcher Dominic Zarecki studied the effects of suspension bans in several California districts: Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco, and Pasadena. The harm to math achievement was large enough to take a student from the 50th percentile to the 39th percentile after three years.\n\nAnti-discipline advocates claim that suspensions can be replaced by \u201crestorative justice\u201d and \u201chealing circles.\u201d In reality, that does further damage. A gold-standard study from the RAND corporation found that in Pittsburgh, \u201crestorative justice\u201d harmed academic achievement among black students.\n\nAnti-discipline advocates claim that they are fighting the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline.\u201d In reality, their policies increase the flow. The idea that not holding kids accountable for their actions will make them more law-abiding as adults is idiotic. If we tell juveniles there are no consequences for misbehavior, we set them up for failure in the workplace. And we put them at risk for a hard reckoning when they find that behavior that didn\u2019t even get them suspended in school gets them a felony charge when they hit age 18.\n\nFor evidence, look no further than Los Angeles. As the school board banned suspensions, referrals to law enforcement increased 145 percent. And last year, threats of violence in Los Angeles schools increased by 70 percent.\n\nI sent my daughter to public school thinking she was safe. I had no idea there was a kid there so dangerous that they frisked him every day. I had no idea that the school was systematically covering up threats and violence. I didn\u2019t know.\n\nI can\u2019t let any other parent make that excuse. That\u2019s why I wrote a book to tell the true story of Parkland. I don\u2019t expect that this article or that book, or that anything, really, will convince the Democratic politicians who run California to think twice about this terrible mistake. My whole life\u2019s mission now is to inform parents.\n\nChances are, your kid won\u2019t get murdered at school. But you have to know about the type of environment you\u2019re putting your child in. Public school in California is now a place where disruption, threats, and even violence can\u2019t even be punished.\n\nMy advice to California parents: Stretch your wallet to send them to private school. Or keep them in public school and roll the dice.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "My daughter Meadow was murdered in the Parkland school shooting in Florida last year.
