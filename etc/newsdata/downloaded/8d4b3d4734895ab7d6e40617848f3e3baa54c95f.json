He is awaiting trial in Japan on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies.\n\nNissan recorded some 150 million yen ($1.4 million) as secretary\u2019s office expenses for three years through March 2014. But the agency ordered Nissan to pay tax on the amount after judging the expenditure was for private use and should not have been deducted as expenses from corporate income, the Yomiuri reported.\n\nWhile the finding has not led to a criminal case, it backs up Nissan\u2019s claim that Ghosn improperly used the company\u2019s money, the newspaper said.\n\nA tax official told Reuters that the agency could not comment on individual cases. A Nissan spokeswoman said the automaker was checking the newspaper report. Lawyers for Ghosn did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.\n\nSince his first arrest in November last year, Ghosn has been charged four times on allegations he underreported his Nissan salary, temporarily transferred personal financial losses to Nissan\u2019s books, and authorized payments to car dealers with the purpose of enriching himself.\n\nOn Thursday, Ghosn\u2019s lawyers said they had asked the Tokyo District Court to dismiss all charges against their client, saying prosecutors had colluded with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him from his post.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Ghosn was working to strengthen Nissan\u2019s relationship with Renault SA (RENA.PA), which he also chaired and which is part-owned by the French government. The effort was unpopular among Nissan management, people close to the Japanese automaker previously told Reuters.\n\nThe Yomiuri said Nissan had already filed a correction and paid additional tax of around several tens of millions of yen (several hundred thousand dollars).\n\nThe tax agency is investigating additional years, the newspaper said.", "description": "Japan's tax authorities have determined former Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> boss Carlos Ghosn used company money for private use, bolstering the automaker's case that he diverted corporate funds for personal gain, the Yomiuri reported on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446044786&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S04R", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
