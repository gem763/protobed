They\u2019ve launched a Japanese-language team site and a Japanese Twitter feed, and they hired a bilingual correspondent who will host a targeted podcast while reporting on all things Hachimura and all things Wizards for an audience nearly 7,000 miles away.\n\nWhile multiple U.S. professional sports teams have embraced foreign-born superstars \u2014 China\u2019s Yao Ming, Japan\u2019s Ichiro Suzuki and Russia\u2019s Alex Ovechkin among them \u2014 teams don\u2019t typically deploy the resources needed to amplify their presence in the player\u2019s home country to cultivate a foreign fan base.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of momentum and excitement,\u201d said Jim Van Stone, president of business operations for Monumental Sports and Entertainment, which owns the Wizards. \u201cI think the Japanese market is potentially a booming market for basketball. It\u2019s traditionally been a baseball marketplace, but we think with the globalness that basketball provides, Japan is really a great opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe NBA has made it a priority to make inroads around the globe, and it identified Japan as a market ripe for growth. This month, the league staged its first preseason game there in 16 years, and Wizards officials said they\u2019ll push to play an exhibition game there, too, either next year or in 2021.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cToday, our business in Japan is in great shape,\u201d said Scott Levy, the NBA\u2019s Asia managing director, \u201cand I believe the game of basketball and the NBA are well-positioned for growth in Japan.\u201d\n\nLevy said Japan is one of the top nations for NBA League Pass subscribers, and more than 1.3 million fans from Japan follow the NBA on social media. This season, fans will be able to access every NBA game, including as many as 15 per week with local commentary. The league believes the sport is poised for a big boost with the rise of Japan\u2019s professional B.League, next year\u2019s Summer Olympics in Tokyo and of course, all the interest tied to Hachimura\u2019s rookie season in the NBA.\n\nHachimura was born and raised in Japan, moving to the United States for college at Gonzaga. Next week, the 21-year-old will become just the third Japanese player to appear in a regular season NBA game and the first to enter the league with any sort of expectations or acclaim. (Yuta Tabuse broke through with the Phoenix Suns in 2004, playing four games in the NBA; Yuta Watanabe, who also went undrafted, logged 15 games for the Memphis Grizzlies last season and is currently on a two-way contract.) Even if Hachimura is not an instant star, he\u2019ll surely be a boon for the Wizards in merchandising and corporate sponsorships.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn April, the NBA launched a new international marketing program allowing each team to sell global rights to two sponsors from outside the United States. The Wizards will announce a new partnership with NEC, a 120-year-old technology company based in Tokyo that will give the team a bigger footprint in Japan and NEC more visibility around Washington.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a really unique opportunity for us to really grow our brand in Japan,\u201d Van Stone said. \u201cWe\u2019ve really taken an aggressive thought process to it and making sure we\u2019re authentic in the process.\u201d\n\nThe team is pleased with the early returns. The new initiatives launched at the start of training camp last month. Within two days, the Japanese Twitter account \u2014 @washwizardsjp \u2014 had amassed 10,000 followers and is now over 13,000. It regularly includes practice updates, game previews and recaps, news conference snippets and short videos. A 10-second clip of Hachimura putting up shots in the paint last week garnered 80,000 views and 2,000 likes. A 15-second video of him shooting three-pointers had nearly 65,000 views and more than 2,500 likes. And a selfie video from media day that featured Hachimura holding the camera and greeting fans in Japanese had more than 129,000 views.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSeeing that huge immediate response, it was like, \u2018Okay, there\u2019s a big demand for this,\u2019 \u201d said Zac Ikuma, the team\u2019s newly hired Japanese-speaking correspondent.\n\nThe team has been working with 24 journalists from Japanese media outlets and expects a large contingent to attend all Wizards games. Fans in Japan can also live-stream every Wizards game \u2014 all NBA games, actually \u2014 using Rakuten\u2019s over-the-top service. But the team feels Ikuma is perfectly situated to tell the Wizards\u2019 story to the Japanese market.\n\nNo other professional sports team in the United States has a position quite like his, and even Ikuma didn\u2019t quite believe it when he heard about the opening over the summer.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor me, I was blown away this kind of opportunity was actually out there,\u201d said Ikuma, who has been in sports media for 14 years, including the past several covering Japan\u2019s Nippon Professional Baseball league. \u201cUsually for bilingual people, the only positions around are interpreters. As important as that job is, I\u2019m really more interested in the storytelling side of things.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWin or lose, his coverage will often revolve around Hachimura. The organization will keep the player\u2019s focus on the court, but Hachimura will often be the featured attraction in its content focused on a Japanese market. The hope is that the Japanese audience will tune in for its homegrown star and fall in love with both the sport and the Washington team in the process.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t assume that Japanese fans are all going to be Wizards fans,\u201d Ikuma said, \u201cbut having the biggest Japanese star on the Wizards is definitely going to help.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Washington has an aggressive plan in place to cater to a Japanese audience, with its first-round draft pick at the center of it.", "authors": ["Rick Maese", "Reporter Covering A Variety Of Subjects", "Including Health", "Safety", "Olympics", "Legal", "Political Issues In Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ENLXGTqWSbx7fgFEtSGPASb3prg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GU4SGIHKZUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
