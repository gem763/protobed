He lived up to his name and he is a great fighter.\n\n\u201cI knew I could beat him with the jab alone, but he had me himself so respect to him.\u201d\n\nThe previously unbeaten Prograis vowed to return after suffering the first defeat of his career.\n\n\u201cThe better man won on the night,\u201d Prograis said. \u201cNo excuses, but I will be back. I am pretty sure Josh enjoyed it, hopefully we can do part two.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Scotland\u2019s Josh Taylor became the unified world champion of the super-lightweight division with a majority decision win over US", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/40de19_scotland-josh-taylor-pictured-2017-now-holds-wba-ibf-titles-an-dis-world-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
