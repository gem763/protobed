But it marked a first when Brits were invited by politicians to quiz Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney as he was giving evidence in front of a panel of lawmakers in Britain\u2019s House of Commons.\n\nForget inflation, monetary policy or the impending doom of a possible recession; this is what the public wanted to know: Who\u2019s your favorite band? How tall are you? And can you lend me a tenner?\n\nThe Treasury Committee allowed the general public to email or tweet their burning questions, which it would relay to the central banker as part of an effort to improve engagement.\n\nUnfortunately, only a selection of the questions were ultimately asked of Carney, so those seeking responses to some of the more left-field inquiries were left in the dark. And, thankfully, most of the 150 responses did strike a weightier tone.\n\n\u201cIf banks and top-rated funds can do it, why can\u2019t the MPC [the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates] be replaced with an algorithm?\u201d asked one individual, while another inquired: \u201cHow do you feel about so many noneconomists leading central banks?\u201d\n\nBekah from London\n\nHow do you feel about so many non economists leading central banks?#askthegovernor \u2014 Superfreak (@SuperFreak1100) October 5, 2019\n\nDale in Chicago mooted, \u201cDo you think the U.S.A.
