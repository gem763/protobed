And while the bank has so far struggled to actually adopt the technology, citing scaling issues, it at least boasts a solid reserve of intellectual property it can develop and try to bring to market.\n\nIt's been building out its virtual assistant Erica with a slew of new features. The voice assistant surpassed 6 million users earlier this year, and BofA has given it several new capabilities since its launch in May 2018, including the ability to flag recurring charges and alert users about upcoming bills. These kinds of value-added features can help drive both higher usage of Erica and deeper digital engagement overall.\n\nThe bank debuted a digital debit card feature in its mobile app in June. The card can be used for in-store, in-app, and online payments as well as to make deposits or withdrawals at BofA's cardless ATMs. Providing a virtual card can be hugely useful for clients currently without a physical debit card \u2014 because they had to cancel a card due to fraud and are waiting for a new one, for example \u2014 as it helps give them less interrupted access to their finances in the interim.\n\nBut developing new technology in-house can also have its risks: Crafting new proprietary tools and features takes time and resources, and the results are not always guaranteed. Chase, for example, ended up shuttering its digital-only bank Finn, citing poor adoption because of a failure to differentiate from Chase's other options.\n\nSo, as BofA or other banks seek to develop new technologies, it's important to have specified goals and use cases for that tech to avoid expending time and money on what turns out to be a dead end.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
