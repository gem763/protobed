Trump and his family have shown themselves perfectly willing to use his position to promote their financial interests, either by directly receiving money from entities seeking favor or benefitting from the incalculable value of publicity that comes every time they visit one of their properties, or both.\n\nSome have said that since Donald Trump came from show business \u2013 where appearances are the coin of the realm \u2013 he would do everything he could to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. But it\u2019s apparent he doesn\u2019t care how it looks. If he did, he wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNor, apparently, do his children. To start with, there is the unprecedented nepotism of his daughter and son-in-law serving as members of the White House staff. And let\u2019s not forget the questions surrounding how Ivanka managed to get approval for more than a dozen Chinese trademarks, or how the \u201ccharity\u201d his son Eric runs spends its money.\n\nAh, ethics.\n\nHarry S Truman, whose ethics were never questioned, famously kept a sign on his desk in the Oval Office that read \u201cThe Buck Stops Here.\u201d I have not been in the Oval Office recently, but I would not be the least bit surprised if Trump has a sign on his desk that reads \u201cThe Buck Is Made Here.\u201d\n\nThe most recent example came just a few days ago when Donald Trump, Jr. was paid big bucks by the University of Florida to speak to students. Lining his custom-made suit pockets with $50,000 from the students\u2019 activities fees shows a startling arrogance, appalling sense of entitlement and deeply disturbing contempt for anything approaching decency. How dare he \u2013 the son of a billionaire \u2013 take money from a non-profit educational organization to advocate for his father\u2019s divisive political agenda?\n\nWhen I served on Ronald Reagan\u2019s White House staff, I was often part of the team that helped select sites for major presidential events. It went without saying that any situation that could in any way suggest even the slightest conflict of interest in terms of real or perceived benefit to the Reagans, their family or any personal friends, was off limits.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Reagans cared deeply about the sacred trust they had been given as occupants of the White House and would not tolerate anything that seemed as though they or people close to them were benefitting from the presidency. That rule was kept in place after they left the White House, too.\n\nI was director of public affairs in Ronald Reagan\u2019s post-presidency office in Los Angeles. A few days after we settled in, the senior staff met with him to discuss upcoming public appearances. Before we began to review the list of invitations that had come in, Reagan told us that he was looking forward to being back on what he called \u201cthe mashed potato circuit.\u201d\n\nHe wanted us to know that he and Nancy had decided they would not accept any money from colleges or charities \u2014 only from for-profit businesses. We faithfully implemented his marching orders.\n\nMaybe too faithfully. In 1989 Nancy and Ronald Reagan were hired by the Japanese media conglomerate Fujisankei Communications Group to make multiple appearances and speeches in Japan over more than a week\u2019s time, for which they were paid $2 million.\n\nCompared to what more recent former presidents and their families have earned and continue to earn for speeches and books, that sum seems quaint today. But back then, it was enough to cause a lot of negative publicity for the Reagans, who were criticized for what some saw as \u201ccashing in\u201d on the presidency. That bothered them a lot, so we on his staff mounted a vigorous defense, saying that while the Reagans were \u201ccomfortable\u201d they were nowhere near rich.\n\nWe pointed out that when they were making movies as studio contract players in the 1930s, '40s and '50s, they did not earn anything near the eye-popping Hollywood salaries that were commonplace in the late 1980s, and that as senior citizens who had just purchased a modest ranch-style home in Los Angeles, it was unwise to assume a 30-year mortgage.\n\nThe facts may have been on our side, but we had limited success in swaying public opinion. To this day, I wish I had tried harder to talk him out of going to Japan.\n\nI failed, but at least the funds he collected came from a for-profit entity, rather than from students, many of whose families sacrifice and struggle to afford tuition, room and board. That stands in sharp contrast to Donald Trump, Jr., who seemingly has no problem taking money from people who need it much more than he does.\n\nThe idea that money that could be used to buy books, housing or food for deserving college students would be used to swell the already grossly large bank account of someone who has never wanted for anything is, to borrow a phrase from Donald Trump, Sr., a disgrace.\n\nMark Weinberg is a communications consultant and executive speechwriter who served as special assistant to the president and assistant press secretary in the Reagan White House and director of public affairs in the office of former President Ronald Reagan.
