According to the Times, Jeong made the decision to leave in August:\n\nOliver Darcy emails: Sarah Jeong is no longer a member of the NYT editorial board. A spokesperson for NYT told me Jeong is no longer an employee, but has shifted to being a contracted contributor for NYT Opinion. \u201cSarah decided to leave the editorial board in August,\u201d said Kate Kingsbury, deputy editorial page editor, \u201cbut we\u2019re glad to still have her journalism and insights around technology in our pages through her work as a contributor.\u201d In an emailed statement, Jeong said the change in role will allow her to \u201cgo back to reporting and writing long features while still being involved with NYT Opinion section on tech issues.\u201d Jeong added, \u201cThe decision was hard because of the many wonderful colleagues I would have to leave behind, but I made the change so I can work on what I want to work on in the immediate moment.\u201d\n\nIf that timeline is accurate, then the comments Jeong made on Twitter a couple of days ago about canceling subscriptions didn\u2019t prompt her firing but may have included a reference to her freedom to say whatever she wants. Jeong was reacting to a surge of cancellations after the Times published details about the whistleblower who is the focus of Democrats\u2019 current impeachment push:\n\nI\u2019ve eschewed children and a mortgage exactly so I can have the freedom to follow my conscience. I will not dissuade anyone else from following their conscience as well. \u2014 sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) September 27, 2019\n\nI guess another thing Jeong has eschewed is a job at the NY Times editorial board. She must have a really high opinion of her own work to think it\u2019s so important that she can\u2019t buy a house or start a family. I mean, there may be some people whose work is too important for any compromise or distraction, I just wouldn\u2019t have put her in that category. She\u2019s basically a writer with an opinion about social media (she thinks it\u2019s bad). For the record, Jeong claims she wasn\u2019t encouraging people to cancel subscriptions in those tweets:\n\nJeong said it was not a \u201ccall to unsubscribe.\u201d She told me, \u201cI\u2019m just weary of having my name and my work invoked as a reason to not boycott. A lot of people have done and continue to do great work at the Times. But if a reader has real, good-faith objections to certain editorial decisions, the fact that the paper has done great work doesn\u2019t negate those objections.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like to me she\u2019s encouraging people to cancel or at least not to not cancel on her account.\n\nJeong has been controversial since she was hired last year. Even a surprising number of NY Times readers thought her anti-white people tweets should have disqualified from a position on the editorial board. I suspect there\u2019s a lot more to this story but we won\u2019t be hearing it until Jeong writes her memoirs.", "description": "\"I made the change so I can work on what I want to work on...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sarah-Jeong.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
