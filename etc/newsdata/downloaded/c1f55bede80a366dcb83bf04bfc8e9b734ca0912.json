Getting a response took almost a year and then the pair exchanged five or six letters to each other every year from that point on.\n\nFriendship forged through pen and paper\n\nWoodall was only 17 when the letter writing began.\n\n\"I just introduced myself and told her about Canada. She toured Japan and told me all about the cherry blossoms and gathering chestnuts,\" she said. \"It was just ordinary teenage girl talk.\"\n\nA selection of early letters written to Shirley Woodall from Michiyo Sekido, 70-year pen pals. (Robin De Angelis)\n\nBoth went on to get married and the depth of their friendship grew. They would confide in each other and share all the details of their lives.\n\n\"We were like sisters,\" said Woodall.\n\nThe two women never met or even spoke on the phone. They did exchange pictures.\n\n\"It was just like today, what the young people do on their computers; we just wrote letters,\" she said.\n\nAn empty mailbox\n\nWoodall is concerned she hasn't heard from Mickey recently. She doesn't even know if her long-time pen pal is still alive. Mickey has suffered health problems and, after her husband died, she moved in with her sister.\n\n\"I sent her a birthday gift and card. If I don't hear anything then I will write to her sister and see if I can find out what happened.\"\n\n(Robin De Angelis)\n\nFor now, Woodall is excited, if not a little surprised, by the Woodstock Museum's interest in their correspondence.\n\n\"I don't know what all the excitement is about,\" said Woodall. \"A lot of people had pen pals. It was jut an ordinary experience as far as I was concerned.\"\n\nVisitors can see the exhibit and experience the friendship of these two women at the Woodstock Museum National Historic Site in downtown Woodstock between Sept. 7, 2019 and Feb. 17, 2020.
