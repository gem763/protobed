Col. Alexander S. Vindman of the Army, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, twice registered internal objections about how Mr. Trump and his inner circle were treating Ukraine, out of what he called a \u201csense of duty,\u201d he plans to tell the inquiry, according to a draft of his opening statement obtained by The New York Times.\n\nHe will be the first White House official to testify who listened in on the July 25 telephone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry, in which Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine , \u201d Colonel Vindman said in his statement. \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. \u201d", "description": "The top Ukraine expert at the White House will tell impeachment investigators he twice reported concerns about President Trump\u2019s pressure tactics on Ukraine, acting out of a \u201csense of duty.\u201d", "authors": ["Danny Hakim"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/us/politics/28dc-testimony1/28dc-testimony1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
