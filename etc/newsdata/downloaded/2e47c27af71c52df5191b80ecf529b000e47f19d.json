People I was following on Twitter were groaning all night.\n\nOh, maybe there were worse ones, I don\u2019t know. But as I think back over the years, there was always one really interesting human being on the stage. Ted Kennedy (all that history). Jesse Jackson (first major African American candidate, and could always turn an unexpected phrase). Bill Clinton (that weird, cagey charisma). Okay, 2000 was a little bit of a black hole, but there were only two candidates. Howard Dean (fun to watch). Barack Obama (Barack Obama).\n\nYou might like their politics or not, but everybody I named above had the ability, sometimes, to transcend politics. What do I mean? I mean they could occasionally find the words to reveal not just a political truth, but a human truth. They could make you stop what you were doing and watch.", "description": "None of them are top-drawer presidential candidates. I don\u2019t say that with pleasure. Quite the opposite.
