That\u2019s a big question mark right now,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nPrimary dealers are banks and other financial institutions approved to trade with the Federal Reserve. In return for that privilege, they are obligated to place bids at the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s debt auctions.\n\nWith the federal fiscal deficit widening, dealers have bought up an increasing amount of government debt, constraining their ability to provide liquidity to funding markets when needed, but only a small proportion of those holdings are in shorter-term Treasury bills.\n\nU.S. Treasurys held by primary dealers stood at $206 billion in the week ending Sept. 25. This compared with their holdings of Treasurys bills which averaged $22.9 billion over the last six months, according to Fed data.\n\nThat\u2019s why analysts say the central bank will most likely have to open up the range of bonds for consideration, such as shorter-term bonds with maturities as much as three years.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated the central bank would only be able to buy $25 billion a month from the bills market, but if it wanted to carry out more substantial purchases to increase the balance sheet, by some estimates as much as $300 billion in the next few months, the Fed would have to look to longer-term bonds.\n\n\u201cWe think the Fed should aim to purchase both bills and short coupons in order to speed the pace of reserve additions,\u201d wrote Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy for BAML.\n\nJohnson suggests, however, Powell\u2019s emphasis on bills may be more about the central bank\u2019s communication strategy as it looks to avoid giving its balance sheet expansion plans any semblance of quantitative easing, which focuses mostly on purchases of longer-term government bonds. How the central bank\u2019s portfolio grows could be more flexible than Powell indicated.\n\n\u201cHe may be erring on the side of over-communicating\u201d that the Fed is not conducting QE, said Johnson.\n\nSince Powell\u2019s speech on Tuesday, the yield for the 3-month Treasury bill TMUBMUSD03M, -0.62% has fallen a few basis points, last seen trading at 1.690%. The 10-year note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.77% finished at 1.649% on Thursday.", "description": "Investors say Powell\u2019s plan to boost the balance sheet has a supply problem.", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT096_fed_ZG_20191010151622.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
