The paperwork was organized in folders from Trump hotels and included together in an envelope labeled \"White House.\"\n\n\"Those folders contained notes from interviews that took place at Rudy Giuliani\u2019s NYC office with various Ukrainians about debunked conspiracies related to Ukraine. This was just another attempt by the White House to peddle Rudy Giuliani conspiracy theories,\" the source added.\n\nRepublicans have doubled down on calls for an investigation into Biden's role in the ouster of a Ukraine prosecutor in 2016, despite no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nThe material shared with staffers and Raskin, the only lawmaker in the meeting, arrived at the State Department in May addressed to Pompeo. It's unclear who beyond the inspector general that Pompeo shared it with.\n\nSchiff, Engel and Cummings said in their joint statement that the inspector general told lawmakers that he interviewed Thomas Ulrich Brechbuhl, Pompeo's counselor. Brechbuhl told the watchdog that \"the packet \u2018came over,\u2019 and that Brechbuhl presumed it was from the White House.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the State Department watchdog didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"We also need to understand Secretary Pompeo\u2019s role, given that it appears that he discussed these documents with at least one of his top aides and that the documents were distributed at the highest levels of the State Department,\" Menendez said.\n\nRaskin noted that the materials came in an envelope addressed to Pompeo with \"White House\" written on the front, but the lawmaker said it was unclear if it was actually from the White House.\n\n\"The real question is, where did it come from?\" Raskin asked. \"It's clear that whoever put it together was attempting to advance exactly the storyline that Mr. Giuliani would like to be advancing.\"\n\nRaskin said that if the documents did not come directly from the White House, he thought they might have come from Giuliani. He stressed that he was making a guess and that the State Department watchdog did not mention Giuliani.\n\n\"If it really did not come directly from the White House, I would guess that it was Giuliani. ...
