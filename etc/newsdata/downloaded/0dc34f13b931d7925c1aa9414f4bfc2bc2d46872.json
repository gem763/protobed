All of the things you associate with a United team simply aren\u2019t there.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to call for any manager to be sacked \u2013 I\u2019ve been there, and it\u2019s not a nice feeling \u2013 but I will reiterate what I said before and say that the board should never have made the decision with Ole as quickly as they did.\n\n\u201cIn my eyes, what had he achieved to deserve that job?\n\n\u201cHe went to Cardiff and took them down, then he went to Molde. So, what on earth makes the board think that he\u2019s the right man for one of, if not the, biggest jobs in football?\u201d\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nDavid de Gea gave an emotional interview to Sky Sports after the defeat at St James' Park in which he insisted this was the worst period of his time at United.\n\nAnd Ince has picked up on the Spaniard's words and hit out at de Gea, who signed a fresh five year contract last month, as clueless and an inspirational leader.\n\n\u201cI watched David De Gea\u2019s post-match interview and I was at a loss,\" Ince said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s meant to be one of the leaders, if that was Peter Schmeichel standing there, there\u2019s no chance you\u2019d have seen that interview.\n\n\u201cRather than him addressing and recognising where the team were going wrong, it just felt like \u2018I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is one of the top players, the leaders at Manchester United, who has just signed a five-year contract!\n\n\u201cAnd he looks like he doesn\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on. If you\u2019re a United fan listening to your goalkeeper, one of the main leaders in the team, and that\u2019s the interview you here you\u2019d be right to be disgraced.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be looking thinking, Jesus, he doesn\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on \u2013 I bet he\u2019s regretting signing that contract.\u201d\n\nPaul Ince was speaking exclusively to Paddy Power News.
