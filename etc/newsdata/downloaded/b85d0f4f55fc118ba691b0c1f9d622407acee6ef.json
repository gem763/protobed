The congressman said he does not know if reports by The Washington Post and other media outlets about its contents are accurate or not.\n\nMr Maguire\u2019s refusal to share the complaint has touched off a legal and political dispute that has spilled into public view and prompted speculation that the spy chief may be improperly protecting the president.\n\n\u201cWe are exploring with the House general counsel what our options are,\u201d Mr Schiff said. \u201cI would imagine if it comes down that we have to go to court to get this that we will have a very good case to seek a temporary restraining order or a mandamus or some urgent form of relief because the inspector general has said this cannot wait. ... There\u2019s an urgency here that I think the courts will recognize.\u201d\n\nMr Schiff said that Mr Maguire is scheduled to appear before his committee in a public session next week \u201cwhere he can explain why this urgent concern should not be shared with the Congress.\u201d\n\nAdam Schiff spoke to reporters about two hours after Mr Trump disputed the report that his interaction with a foreign leader had prompted an official in the US intelligence community to file a whistleblower complaint, saying it was inconceivable that he would say anything inappropriate on a heavily monitored phone call.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\u201d\n\nMr Trump dismissed the report as \u201cFake News\u201d and said in another tweet that he was subject to \u201cPresidential Harassment!\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s interaction with the foreign leader included a \u201cpromise\u201d that was regarded as so troubling that it prompted the intelligence official to file a whistleblower complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence community, according to two former U.S. officials familiar with the matter. The former officials spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nOne former official said the communication was a phone call.\n\nIt was not immediately clear which foreign leader Trump was speaking with or what he pledged to deliver, but his direct involvement in the matter had not been previously disclosed. It raises new questions about the president\u2019s handling of sensitive information and may further strain his relationship with U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nThe White House declined to comment late Wednesday night. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and a lawyer representing the whistleblower declined to comment.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u00a0warned of possible legal action Thursday if intelligence officials did not share a potentially explosive whistleblower complaint prompted by President Donald Trump\u2019s interactions with a foreign leader.
