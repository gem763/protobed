The first season told its own story but incorporated familiar places like Shawshank Penitentiary and familiar names like Alan Pangborn. Season two, which launched on October 23, gives us its own version of Annie Wilkes, one of King\u2019s most iconic characters, but it once again contains references to much more than just one book or film. We\u2019re here to break it down, episode by episode, week by week. Major spoilers follow, of course.\n\n\u201cLet the River Run\u201d (Episode 1)\n\nAnnie Wilkes\n\nPhoto: Hulu/Hulu\n\nWell, this is the big one, of course. In season two of Castle Rock, Lizzy Caplan plays Annie Wilkes, a version of the same character from Stephen King\u2019s 1987 novel Misery and the 1990 Rob Reiner film of the same name, which won Kathy Bates an Oscar. This version of Wilkes isn\u2019t keeping her favorite writer hostage (at least not yet), but the nurse is on the run from her past and her addictions, both of which push her into the town of Castle Rock with her daughter, Joy, played by Elsie Fisher. The Castle Rock Annie uses some of the same cheesy phrases as the King version (\u201cdirty birds\u201d) and seems dangerously overprotective of her daughter. As the end of the season premiere makes clear, she\u2019s willing to do anything to keep her safe.\n\nJerusalem\u2019s Lot\n\nPhoto: Hulu\n\nIn the premiere, a Somali Community and Business Center is being built in the neighboring town of Jerusalem\u2019s Lot, a very familiar name for King fans. It has been either a setting or a place mentioned in a dozen King books, most notably Salem\u2019s Lot, which feels early on like it could be the second biggest reference point for this season of Castle Rock, especially with all the talk of witches buried under the ground (a main thrust of that book). The place first appeared in the short story \u201cJerusalem\u2019s Lot,\u201d collected in Night Shift, in which it is revealed that a cult of witches founded the town. It\u2019s a prequel to the novel Salem\u2019s Lot and the short story \u201cOne for the Road,\u201d also included in Night Shift.\n\nAlso, the title of the episode is a reference to Carly Simon\u2019s Oscar-winning song from Working Girl, which features a line about a \u201cNew Jerusalem.\u201d That\u2019s not a coincidence.\n\nShawshank Penitentiary\n\nPhoto: Hulu\n\nJust as in season one, the legendary prison is one of the first reference points for the second year of Castle Rock. It\u2019s unlikely to be as prominent as the first year, in which the iconic institution from The Shawshank Redemption was a major setting, but it\u2019s clever of the writers to include a shot of a sign that says \u201cShawshank State Prison 18 Miles\u201d as Annie Wilkes drives into town. It lets viewers know that we\u2019ve returned to the King multiverse.\n\nThe Opening Credits\n\nPhoto: Hulu\n\nOnce again, Castle Rock drops a few references into its opening credits, a new one for season two that focuses more on Misery, of course, but drops in a few more sources that will clearly influence this season. We see a chapter page from Salem\u2019s Lot; actual text from Misery; a ripped page from Dolores Claiborne; a shot of the words Misery\u2019s Return, which is a book within the book Misery by fictional author Paul Sheldon; a blueprint of Shawshank; finally, a shot of the iconic words \u201cThey float, Georgie\u201d from It.\n\nPop Merrill and the Emporium Galorium\n\nPhoto: Hulu\n\nThe creators of Castle Rock used \u201cThe Sun Dog,\u201d which was featured in the 1990 collection Four Past Midnight, for some of season one, and return to it this year for the characters of Pop Merrill (Tim Robbins) and his slimy nephew Ace (Paul Sparks). In \u201cThe Sun Dog,\u201d Pop owned a shop called the Emporium Galorium, which has been reimagined for the show, along with an auto-body shop next door. Although Ace Merrill existed before his uncle \u2026\n\nAce Merrill\n\nPhoto: Hulu/Hulu\n\nPaul Sparks\u2019s sociopath in Castle Rock is a variation on the character played by Kiefer Sutherland in Stand by Me, based on King\u2019s \u201cThe Body,\u201d and also a character in Needful Things. In the literary world, Ace died in 1991 after doing a stint at Shawshank. In the TV one, he died after Annie Wilkes shoved an ice-cream scooper down his throat. Well, at least for a little while.\n\nCastle Rock Season One\n\nAt one point, Annie says to her daughter, \u201cI\u2019ve heard things. Massacres, kids vanishing into thin air.\u201d Clearly this is a reference to season one of Castle Rock, which was about a kid who vanished into thin air, although it could also be a shout-out to a number of disappearing kids from the King multiverse.\n\nTim Robbins\n\nPhoto: Hulu/Hulu\n\nJust as the creators of Castle Rock called back to King lore simply by casting Sissy Spacek and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd (a.k.a. Carrie and Pennywise) in season one, it feels like a definite nod to King history to even include Tim Robbins on this show. He may not be playing Andy Dufresne, but it\u2019s impossible not to think of arguably his most iconic role from The Shawshank Redemption, especially in this universe.\n\nThe Mellow Tiger\n\nAs Annie drives through town, there\u2019s a shot of this bar, a central location from season one that comes straight out of King\u2019s 1991 novel Needful Things, one of the strongest reference points of season one.\n\n\u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d (Episode 2)\n\nMarsten House\n\nPhoto: Hulu\n\nWhile the news that season two would feature Annie Wilkes as the protagonist led many people to presume that Misery would be the main touchstone for Castle Rock this year, it would appear that the world of Salem\u2019s Lot is going to take that prize. After Annie finds her way out of the hole in which she fell at the end of the premiere, she ends up in a creepy, rundown mansion called Marsten House, a direct reference to the central location of King\u2019s second novel, published in 1975. Sitting on a hill overlooking the city of Jerusalem\u2019s Lot just as it did in King\u2019s book, Marsten House feels like one of the most direct riffs on King lore that the series has yet produced. Later, when Pop refers to the history of the region and says, \u201cSatanists made a bad deal with the wrong hombre and they burned for it,\u201d he\u2019s directly referencing the plot of the prequel, \u201cJerusalem\u2019s Lot.\u201d\n\nNan\u2019s Luncheonette\n\nIn the flashback to when Pop adopted Abdi and Nadia, he gives them food and milkshakes from this classic King location, featured in The Dark Half, Needful Things, It, and \u201cThe Sun Dog,\u201d as well as being name-dropped in season one of Castle Rock.\n\n\u201cTies That Bind\u201d (Episode 3)\n\n\u201cThe Body\u201d/Stand by Me\n\nPhoto: Hulu/Hulu\n\nWhen Chance and two other friends go with Joy to find the body of Ace Merrill in Castle Lake, it\u2019s very clearly a riff on the quartet that goes searching for a corpse in the short story famously turned into Stand by Me. There\u2019s even some playfulness here with names, as one of the kids in the short story was named Gordon LaChance (turned into just Chance here) and another was named Vern (adapted into Vera here).\n\nCastle Rock Season One\n\nWhen the kids get to the lake, they reference the fact that the warden of Shawshank killed himself there, but \u201cthey found the body but not the head.\u201d Of course, this is a reference to a subplot in season one.\n\nDerry, Maine\n\nWhen Ace returns from the dead to see Pop, he says he was in Derry, a common setting for King\u2019s fiction. It appears in several of his most famous works, including Pet Sematary, 11/22/63, Needful Things, The Tommyknockers, and many more. It\u2019s perhaps most famously known for being the place where things get intense every 27 years in a little story called It.\n\nMisery\n\nPhoto: Hulu/Hulu\n\nWith Annie Wilkes being this year\u2019s protagonist, the assumption was that she would kidnap someone and tie them to a bed \u00e0 la her iteration in Misery. As they so often do, the writers subvert that a bit when they have Joy, Annie\u2019s daughter, tie her mother to the bed in a way that\u2019s very reminiscent of Paul Sheldon\u2019s captivity in the King book and hit film.", "description": "The Hulu series brings Lizzie Caplan\u2019s Annie Wilkes (Misery) to the town of Castle Rock, but the second season\u2019s shout-outs to Stephen King go far beyond that, with nods to Salem\u2019s Lot, Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, etc. How many can you spot?", "authors": ["Brian Tallerico"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/24/castle-rock/24-castle-rock-easter-eggs.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
