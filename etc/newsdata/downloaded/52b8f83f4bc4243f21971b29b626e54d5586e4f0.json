A Sunni Arab insider provided the key to unlock an operation to capture or kill ISIS \u201ccaliph\u201d Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Washington Post reported last night, adding to a legend that includes a panty raid and plenty of other intrigue. Not only did this man finger Baghdadi, he remained in place during the raid so as not to tip off the already-paranoid ISIS leader:\n\nOne official knowledgeable about the informant said the man was a trusted facilitator and logistics aide who was involved in helping Baghdadi move among safe houses in the Idlib area before relocating to the compound where he met his end. The informant, who was described as a committed and even enthusiastic participant in the mission, provided essential personal details about the reclusive terrorist leader, including the fact that he always traveled with a suicide belt so he could kill himself if cornered. The informant was so trusted that at times he escorted members of Baghdadi\u2019s family to get medical care. \u2026 The mole\u2019s detailed knowledge of Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts as well as the room-by-room layout of his sanctuary proved to be critical in the Oct. 26 raid that ended with the death of the world\u2019s most-wanted terrorist, the officials said. The informant was present during the assault on Baghdadi\u2019s compound in the Syrian province of Idlib, and he was exfiltrated from the region two days later with his family. The man, whose nationality had not been revealed, is expected to receive some or all of the $25 million U.S. bounty that had been placed on Baghdadi\u2019s head, according to the officials. One official said he was a Sunni Arab who turned against the Islamic State because one of his relatives had been killed by the group.\n\nPay him the money! I\u2019d say he earned it. Granted, his backstory is a little self-serving \u2014 ISIS was just fine and dandy, it seems, until his family paid the price \u2014 but the informant served up Baghdadi as the reward requested. And we even got Abu Hassan al-Muhajir as a two-fer, plus whomever else we roll up with the intel we\u2019re gathering from these raids. Twenty-five million is cheap in comparison to the lives that won\u2019t be lost to these psychopaths.\n\nBut maybe keep an eye on the money and the informant for a while, too.\n\nThe US military has dumped Baghdadi\u2019s remains at sea already, but not before parsing through them carefully to ensure they had the right man. Although special forces got a DNA sample to confirm the identity of the corpse, the Post\u2019s grim recounting of the aftermath notes that the test was unnecessary. Baghdadi\u2019s head was, um \u2026\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s head was apparently intact after the explosion, and U.S. operators were convinced of his identity even before a field DNA test was conducted for confirmation, the official said. One of the commandos radioed his impressions. \u201cLooking at him. This is Baghdadi,\u201d the operator said, according to the official. \u201cJackpot.\u201d\n\nJackpot is right, and not just for the commandoes or for the informant. Let\u2019s remember the families of the victims of ISIS\u2019 brutality, from journalists like James Foley and Steven Sotloff to aid workers like Peter Kassig and especially Kayla Mueller, who got brutalized by Baghdadi himself before reportedly getting killed in a US airstrike. Her parents again expressed their appreciation for the efforts of the US military on this morning\u2019s Today show on NBC, and also their happiness at seeing Baghdadi\u2019s end at their hands. \u201cI\u2019m glad this evil person is gone,\u201d said her father. \u201cHow would you feel?\u201d Exactly the same, Mr. Mueller.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that evil person is gone. \u2026 If you were a parent and this man did what he did to Kayla to your child, and then they got him, how would you feel?\u201d \u2014 Kayla Mueller\u2019s father on the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. pic.twitter.com/FdIQ1TKkx9 \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) October 30, 2019\n\nNow they want to find out where their daughter\u2019s remains are buried so that they can bring her home \u2014 if she\u2019s actually dead:\n\nThe Muellers also spoke of their sliver of hope that their daughter might still be alive, which they called a \u201cone percent chance.\u201d Carl Mueller said authorities based confirmation of her death on an announcement from ISIS and from photographs. \u201cWe just decided it was our mission \u2026 until she\u2019s home, we\u2019ve got to find her,\u201d and find out what happened to her, Marsha Mueller said.\n\nHeartbreaking. At least the Muellers have the comfort of knowing their daughter\u2019s tormentor died like a coward in a mission dedicated to her.", "description": "Plus: Kayla Mueller parents \"glad that evil person is gone.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/carl-mueller.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
