I think that really does devalue the people in Wisconsin and Michigan and others who decided to vote for President Trump. Whether you like this President or not, whether you believe that he should have been President or not, let\u2019s give the credit to the Americans who went out and voted for somebody who they thought would bring change. And the question is, are we going to be responsive to some of the messages that were out there and do you hear me now? People who felt that they were disadvantaged by globalization, the unemployed coalminers in West Virginia, the opioid addict in Pennsylvania, are we going to be responsive to those people? That\u2019s really the question we should be asking.\n\nGuthrie is in a state of shock because she has just been so completely, yet so diplomatically, shut down. There is really nothing she can say. She immediately shifts back to the new book (about the Cold War) that Rice appeared on the show to promote.\n\nGuthrie says, \u201cWell, the book of course is called \u201cTo Build A Better World.\u201d It\u2019s got a lot of thought provoking issues in it. Thank you so much for being here this morning.\u201d\n\nAnd that was the end of that.", "description": "MSNBC Anchor Asks Condoleezza Rice If Russia\u2019s Interference Elected Trump; Rice Leaves Her Speechless", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Sarah Lee", "Alex Parker", "Amelia Hamilton", "Posted At Am On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/AP_778644373816-e1568273153639.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
