They provoked and obstructed the police repeatedly but generally retreated once riot officers moved in, avoiding some of the direct clashes that characterized earlier protests.\n\nLate at night, though, video from Hong Kong broadcaster TVB showed police using batons while on the platform of Prince Edward subway station and swinging batons at passengers who backed into one end of a train car behind umbrellas. The video also shows pepper spray being shot through an open door at a group seated on the floor while one man holds up his hands.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear if all the passengers were protesters or what precipitated the incident, which was widely shared on social media as another example of police brutality during the protests. Angry crowds gathered outside Prince Edward and nearby Mongkok station, where police also rushed in and made arrests.\n\nA protester stands under a bridge as police fire water cannon outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong on August 31, 2019, in the latest opposition to a planned extradition law that has since morphed into a wider call for democratic rights in the semi-autonomous city.

A now-shelved extradition bill brought to the fore simmering concerns about what many in the city see as an erosion of the rights and freedoms that residents are supposed to have under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework.\n\nThe mostly young, black-shirted protesters took over roads and major intersections in shopping districts on Saturday as they rallied and marched with no obvious destination in mind.\n\nAuthorities closed streets and a subway stop near the Chinese government office and parked water cannon trucks and erected additional barriers nearby, fearing protesters might target the building. The office would have been the endpoint of the march that police did not allow.\n\nInstead, a group of hard-line protesters decided to take on police guarding government headquarters from behind large barriers that ring the building to keep demonstrators at bay.\n\nWhile others marched back and forth nearby, a large crowd wearing helmets and gas masks gathered outside. They pointed laser beams at the officers\u2019 heads and threw objects over the barriers and at them. Police responded with tear gas, and protesters threw gasoline bombs into the compound.\n\nThen came the blue water. A water cannon truck fired regular water, followed by repeated bursts of colored water, staining protesters and nearby journalists and leaving blue puddles in the street.\n\nRiot police fire blue dye water canon at demonstrators during a protest in the central district of Hong Kong, China, on Saturday, Aug. 31, 2019.

A few front-line protesters hurled gasoline bombs at the officers in formation, but there were no major clashes as police cleared the area.\n\nProtesters regrouped and blocked a major commercial street by piling up barricades and setting a large fire. Smoke billowed into the air as hundreds of protesters waited on the other side of the makeshift barrier, many pointing laser beams that streaked the night sky above them.\n\nFirefighters made their way into the congested area on foot to put out the fire. Police in riot gear removed the barricades and moved in quickly. They could be seen detaining a few protesters, but by then, most had already left. As police advanced east down Hennessey Road, protesters made another stand in the Causeway Bay shopping district. They threw gasoline bombs at police, who fired tear gas and water cannons.\n\nProtesters built another fire, a smaller one, in front of Sogo department store. Police waited behind their riot shields while firefighters put out the smoldering fire with extinguishers. When police moved in, the protesters had again retreated. Other groups crossed Hong Kong\u2019s harbor to the Tsim Sha Tsui district, where police said they set fires and threw gasoline bombs on Nathan Road.\n\nDemocratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting said Hong Kong citizens would keep fighting for their rights and freedoms despite the arrests of several prominent activists and lawmakers in the past two days, including activist Joshua Wong.\n\nProtesters are demanding the full withdrawal of the extradition bill \u2014 which would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China to stand trial \u2014 as well as democratic elections and an investigation into alleged police brutality in past battles with hard-line demonstrators.\n\n\u201cI do believe the government deliberately arrested several leaders of the democratic camp to try to threaten Hong Kong people not to come out to fight against the evil law,\u201d Lam said at what was advertised as a Christian march earlier Saturday.\n\nAbout 1,000 people marched to a Methodist church and police headquarters. They alternated between singing hymns and chanting slogans of the pro-democracy movement. An online flyer for the demonstration called it a \u201cprayer for sinners\u201d and featured images of a Christian cross and embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who had proposed the extradition bill.\n\nProtesters standoff with police in cloud of tear gas during a clash at an anti-government rally outside of Central Government Complex on August 31, 2019 in Hong Kong, China.

Police said that while previous marches have started peacefully, they have increasingly degenerated into violence in the end.\n\nThe standing committee of China\u2019s legislature ruled on Aug. 31, 2014, that Hong Kong residents could elect their leader directly, but that the candidates would have to be approved by a nominating committee.\n\nThe decision failed to satisfy democracy advocates in Hong Kong and led to the 79-day long Occupy Central protests that fall, in which demonstrators camped out on major streets in the financial district and other parts of the city.\n\nThe participants in the religious march Saturday were peaceful and mostly older than the younger protesters who have led this summer\u2019s movement and, in some cases, blocked streets and battled police with bricks, sticks and gasoline bombs Religious meetings do not require police approval, though authorities said late Friday that organizers of a procession with more than 30 people must notify police.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Activists, meanwhile, threw gasoline bombs at government headquarters and set fires in the streets on the thirteenth weekend of protests", "authors": ["Ken Moritsugu", "Raf Wober"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/hong-kong-protests.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
