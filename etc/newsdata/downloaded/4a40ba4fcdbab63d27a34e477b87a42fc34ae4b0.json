We've so far received eight children and four of those by air ambulance, two by ground ambulance, and two by private vehicle that were brought in by their parents. They have all been seen, assessed and examined, and we're currently treating their injuries,\" said trauma medical director Regan Williams at a news conference Tuesday at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital.\n\nThomas Wells/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal via AP\n\nWilliams said that four were going to require admission to the hospital and were considered serious but not critical.\n\n\"The other four have very minor or no injuries and will likely go home today,\" Williams said.\n\nMississippi Highway Patrol said the eight students ranged in age from 7-13.\n\n\"The driver was pronounced dead at the scene,\" Cpl. Jason Roe said during a news conference.\n\nBenton County coroner Larry Hobson told ABC News the official cause of death of the bus driver is \"sudden cardiac death.\" Hobson said the driver \"clutched his chest and slumped over,\" according to the students on the bus.\n\nHobson and Mississippi Highway Patrol identified the bus driver as 63-year-old William Chester Cole. No autopsy will be performed, according to Hobson.\n\nThomas Wells/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal via AP\n\nWilliams said that none of the children had been ejected from the bus but that they'd sustained their injuries from being bounced around the vehicle during the crash.\n\nDavid Lloyd said that his daughter, an eighth-grade student, had a broken ankle, leg and jaw but would still survive.\n\n\"Just a little devastated but at least the good Lord was with everybody and had their hands on everybody,\" Lloyd told ABC News affiliate WATN-TV. \"Just keep everybody in thoughts and prayers.\"\n\nSuperintendent Steve Bostick said that Cole had worked for the school district for about five years.\n\n\"He's one of the most dependable drivers we have in the district and like I said, he's a very hard-working man,\" Bostick told WATV-TV. \"I'm sorry that this happened. I give my regards to the family.\"", "description": "A coroner said the driver", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/mississippi-bus-crash-01-ap-jef-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
