Often precarious, it now seems to be unravelling altogether, collapsing under the weight of its own contradictions, flawed assumptions, and lack of willing partners. During the past few weeks, Trump\u2019s Afghanistan peace talks fell apart after he withdrew an ill-advised invitation to the Taliban to Camp David; his North Korea nuclear talks appear all but dead, and Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear arsenal is now reported to have grown significantly during Trump\u2019s tenure; and his on-again, off-again trade talks with China have so far resulted only in escalating tariffs that are now unnerving businesses worldwide\u2026\n\nI asked a Republican who knows O\u2019Brien from both the Bush and Trump Administrations whether he was ready for such an enormous challenge. \u201cNice guy, but in way, way over his head,\u201d the Republican, a former senior Bush Administration official, told me. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with a series of national-security advisers, and he\u2019s not qualified to be national-security adviser,\u201d he added, pointing out that \u201che has no experience on Russia or arms control or intelligence or covert action or Latin America. Now he\u2019s got the whole world.\u201d The Republican said that he liked O\u2019Brien and just wished that he had said no to the President, predicting, \u201cI don\u2019t think this will end well.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Susan Glasser", "Newyorker.Com News Letter-From-Trumps-Washington It-Wont-End-Well-Trump-And-His-Obscure-New-National-Security-Chief"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
