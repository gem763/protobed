Now we\u2019re turning our Art Club into an interview series in which we catch up with the artists and designers we admire and find out what drives them.\n\nThere\u2019s a special type of anxiety that comes from taking apart a piece of tech. Whether you\u2019re opening up a red-ringed Xbox 360 or replacing the RAM on your MacBook Pro, you can\u2019t escape it. There\u2019s always a fear of bending a pin, shocking a board, or putting it all back together only to realize you have one tiny screw left over.\n\nAuckland, New Zealand-based photographer Richard Parry channels this fear in his beautifully shocking Some Assembly Required photo series. Parry tears apart the most iconic tech from the past few decades and displays it in an awe-inspiring matrix of nuts and bolts, each piece marking the evolution of consumer tech from the inside out.\n\nI spoke with Parry about the process behind exploding a piece of tech, balancing the line between the real and artificial, and what devices gave him the most trouble.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nTell me about your background. How did you first get into photography?\n\nI was born in Auckland, New Zealand, and I\u2019ve spent my entire life here. I think I\u2019ve always been quite creative, but it took me a long time to find a medium to express it in. I didn\u2019t buy a camera until I was in my mid-20s, but by then, I had a really firm working knowledge of photo editing software. I just needed images to edit at that point.\n\nDid you go to school for this?\n\nNope. I learned everything I know from the YouTube community. It\u2019s really incredible what you can achieve for free from your home. Shoutout to Aaron Nace from Phlearn. Their work is so valuable.\n\nHow did Some Assembly Required come together? What inspired it?\n\nI\u2019d just finished another series where I\u2019d make huge, ridiculous food monstrosities, and I was looking for the next series. Following on with more food, I \u201cdisassembled\u201d a PopTart and some pizza. I had an old film camera laying around, and I thought I\u2019d try that, too. I got a lot of positive feedback on that, and I set out to find culturally relevant objects to feature and settled on video games consoles and handhelds. I think people were excited to see what was inside these items they\u2019d spent so much time with.\n\nWhat\u2019s the process behind these?\n\nFirst, I\u2019ve got to strip them all down to their parts and clean all the years of dirt and dust out. (There\u2019s heaps.) I lay everything out in order of what level they\u2019ll be on. To achieve the floating in midair look, I separate everything with clear sheets of plastic on a rig I made out of PVC piping.\n\nHow long does each piece take to create?\n\nDepending on the complexity of the item, it can range. Roughly 15 hours per piece, I\u2019d say.\n\nWas there a particular device that was noticeably more annoying to dissect than another? On the flip side, which one was your favorite to work on?\n\nModern items are much more annoying to work with. There\u2019s a lot more glue and plastic clips holding everything down, which can be impossible to remove without damaging something else. Older consoles are a breeze. Everything is held in with screws, and all the components have room to breathe inside the case. That being said, older items tended to be permanently soldered, which you don\u2019t see so much in modern products.\n\nDo you try to put these items back together, or is that an exercise in futility? Have you ever lost a small piece and failed to put something back together? Did you buy these items with the full intent of destroying them?\n\nI\u2019ve tried my hardest to buy already broken secondhand items online. So typically, I don\u2019t have to worry about breaking it any further because they\u2019re already trash. All of the Nintendo handhelds, though, went back together, and I upcycled them and sold them on their way. A couple of times, I was even able to find what had failed in them and get them working again.\n\nMany people are shocked when they find out these images aren\u2019t renders. Do you walk the line between real and artificial purposefully?\n\nIt\u2019s a careful tightrope. People often assume they\u2019re rendered. I\u2019m told that to render them at this level of detail would be even more work than photographing them. I really have a lot of respect for 3D artists. I don\u2019t have the patience for it at all. I think people connect with the work more when they know it\u2019s a real item.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite creative tools and resources? What software do you use on a daily basis?\n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned before, the YouTube creative learning community is such a wealth of knowledge, and I owe a lot to them. I work in Adobe Creative Suite \u2014 and love them or hate them, it\u2019s the best creative software on the planet.\n\nHow do you rest and recharge yourself when you\u2019re out of ideas?\n\nMy day job as an electrician kind of holds me back from doing as much creative work as I\u2019d like. I\u2019ve got pages and pages of ideas that I just can\u2019t get to. I\u2019m definitely set with ideas for a long time. I mostly do this on my days off, and I count my creative work as my rest and recharging state.\n\nWhat\u2019s your dream project, something you\u2019d love to work on in the future?\n\nOh man, I\u2019d love to work on something massive like a car. I\u2019d need like an airplane hangar to get it to look right, though. Maybe one day.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for you?\n\nI\u2019m sticking with this until I run out of interesting items to take apart. I think I will probably circle back to working with food again.", "description": "New Zealand-based photographer Richard Parry channels the fear of taking tech apart in his beautiful Some Assembly Required photo series.
