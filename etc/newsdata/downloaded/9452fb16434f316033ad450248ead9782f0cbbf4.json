Leland Keyser \u2014 Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s friend, and the person Ford herself testified was also at the party where Ford claims Kavanaugh assaulted her \u2014 has stated on the record that she doesn\u2019t have \u201cany confidence\u201d in Ford\u2019s story. Not only does she not recall the specific party at issue, she doesn\u2019t recall \u201cany others like it.\u201d Moreover, Keyser maintains this recollection in spite of a determined effort by old friends to get her to change her testimony: a pressure campaign that Keyser admirably resisted. The Times didn\u2019t highlight this story. Instead the reporters made a new allegation against Kavanaugh in the paper. They claimed that a man named Max Stier alleged that at a drunken college party, \u201cfriends\u201d pushed Kavanaugh\u2019s penis into the hand of a female student. Democrats furiously denounced Kavanaugh. Only later did the Times add that the female student \u201cdeclined to be interviewed,\u201d and her \u201cfriends say that she does not recall the incident.\u201d The Times went into full spin mode. One had not thought the newspaper would be able to top its partisan and inaccurate coverage of Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings. But it seems determined to continue disgracing itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Elizabeth Warren is rising fast in the Democratic primaries. She\u2019s capitalizing on doubts about Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, and benefiting from great press about her allegedly thoughtful policy proposals (about which, see this issue). Still to be determined is whether she can appeal to black voters. But she is already slightly ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire, where they don\u2019t exist in any numbers. That embarrassing DNA test is just a distant memory \u2014 until she wins the nomination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 For a few days, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., had nothing to say. Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg finally called the news \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d and said he hoped it would not become political. Ulrich Klopfer, who operated an abortion clinic in town before losing his license for legal and ethical violations, had recently died in Illinois, whereupon it had been discovered that his garage contained 2,246 \u201cfetal remains,\u201d as the news accounts put it. It is indeed disturbing that Klopfer kept the corpses of his victims. It ought to disturb us more that politics enabled him to rack up so many.\n\n\u2022 New numbers from the Guttmacher Institute confirm that the long-running decline in the abortion rate continued through 2017. At that point it was lower than in 1973, the year of Roe v. Wade. The institute cautions that the decline may be overstated, as an increasing number of pregnant women may be using abortion pills and not reporting it. Because the institute is firmly ensconced inside the abortion lobby, it takes pains to deny that the decline has much to do with pro-life legislation or a shift in attitudes. It prefers to credit reduced pregnancy rates, which it then links to increased contraceptive use and finally to Obamacare\u2019s subsidies and mandates. But the institute\u2019s own numbers show that the abortion ratio \u2014 the percentage of pregnancies that end in abortion \u2014 has also declined, and that this decline too predates Obamacare. The movement against abortion is making some progress. As the number is at least 862,000 per year, none of its members will take it as a reason to rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Democrats called for the resignation of the housing and urban-development secretary, Ben Carson, after supposedly \u201ctransphobic\u201d comments he made during a recent visit to San Francisco. In an internal meeting, Carson explained to around 50 HUD staffers the dangers of \u201cbig, hairy men\u201d trying to infiltrate women\u2019s shelters, which had been brought to his attention by various women\u2019s groups that had told him that the abused women they serve feel \u201cunsafe.\u201d After some HUD staffers were offended by Carson\u2019s statement, it became a national news story. Carson kept his nerve, a sufficiently rare occasion these days to be worth commending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Cory Booker is not right about much, but he was right to suggest that Democrats have an \u201cobligation to listen to scientists\u201d on nuclear power, lest they resemble the so-called climate deniers in the GOP. If the Democrats believe their own increasingly hysterical invocations of looming climate cataclysm, they should acknowledge that nuclear power is the most efficient and effective alternative to fossil fuels. Nuclear power emits no greenhouse gases and, despite high startup costs, is cheaper than almost any alternative energy source on a per-unit basis. Booker is one of a vanishingly small number of Democratic candidates willing to say so, and for that we give Spartacus a momentary salute.\n\n\u2022 Thirteen and a half years ago Al Gore warned us, in the course of promoting a movie, that we were in a \u201ctrue planetary emergency\u201d and that \u201cunless drastic measures to reduce greenhouse gases [were] taken within the next 10 years, the world [would] reach a point of no return.\u201d Connoisseurs of catastrophism will note that it is always about ten years until the true nightmare begins: just close enough that immediate action is needed, just far enough to persuade us that we can swerve to avoid the looming threat. Like the sweaty gambler who swears that this time his tip will pay off, global-warming alarmists never acknowledge error in the past, which is why their predictions of future trends tend to be treated with skepticism. Sometimes the alarmists undercut their own warnings. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told us last winter, \u201cThe world is going to end in twelve years if we don\u2019t address climate change,\u201d but added a few weeks later that this remark was \u201cdry humor and sarcasm.\u201d The joke is lost on the likes of the bitter 16-year-old Swedish girl Greta Thunberg, who led a global strike of children to persuade the world to \u201ctake action\u201d on climate change. Thunberg\u2019s demented address to a delighted United Nations Climate Summit on September 23 (\u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. . . . We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!\u201d) was a new high-water mark in hysteria, breathlessly hyped by media that have become convinced that using hyperbolic terms such as \u201cclimate crisis\u201d or \u201cclimate emergency\u201d will finally convince us to \u201cdo something.\u201d Climate change is a problem that should be dealt with, but the media\u2019s unhinged rants and slavering coverage of Thunberg\u2019s paranoia are needlessly terrifying impressionable children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Andrew Yang, the Democratic Silicon Valley presidential hopeful, can surprise, pleasantly. Like Cory Booker, he has good words for nuclear power, which his website calls \u201ca crucial component\u201d of a \u201csustainable, carbon-free energy\u201d policy. After Saturday Night Live dropped Shane Gillis, a new hire who turned out to have told some dodgy Chinese jokes in his time, Yang said that, after watching videos of Gillis\u2019s routines, he did not find him \u201cmalignant or evil\u201d and agreed to meet him. But then Yang will come out with a proposal to raise the price of beef in order to \u201cmodify Americans\u2019 diets over time\u201d (since cattle are \u201cvery energy-consuming\u201d), or speculate about the future of the car: President Yang would offer to buy back gas guzzlers, while futurist Yang hopes that by 2050 privately owned cars will be replaced by fleets of roving electric vehicles. Sounds like Yang should be running for a consultancy at the Energy Department, or possibly a slot on the White House staff instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Farmers, according to President Trump, \u201ccan\u2019t be too upset, because I gave them $12 billion, and I gave them $16 billion this year.\u201d Pardon us \u2014 who gave them all that money? President Trump is here giving a lesson in swampology \u2014 it is easy, painless, and rewarding to give away other people\u2019s money. At issue here are the president\u2019s ill-advised tariffs on China. While disagreeing with his strategy, we have held out hope that it would yet lead to a good deal. But the costs are mounting. The aid given to farmers hurt by Chinese trade retaliation has now cost more than twice what was paid out in the auto-company bailouts of 2008\u201309: cost American taxpayers, that is, not the president.\n\n\u2022 The Trump administration has allowed itself to be buffaloed into a panic over \u201cvaping,\u201d in which electronic devices are used to produce a nicotine-laced vapor that is inhaled, often as a substitute for cigarette smoking. The media-bred panic follows an outbreak of lung trouble among vapers, with about 500 cases and eight deaths reported to the Centers for Disease Control. The vast majority of those cases involved the use of illegal black-market vaping cartridges containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. One of the cases involved marijuana oil bought from a legal dispensary. The exact cause of the lung damage remains unclear. The most popular vaping product, Juul, is marketed as an alternative to smoking cigarettes, and studies have suggested that using nicotine vapor, which involves no combustion of tobacco, is much less harmful than smoking cigarettes. (It isn\u2019t the nicotine that gives smokers cancer \u2014 it\u2019s the smoke.) The Trump administration plans to prohibit certain flavors of vaping products on the theory that these appeal to underage users; a far better approach would be to punish those who illegally sell these products to children with heavy fines, revocation of business licenses, and, if warranted, jail time. Done properly, vaping is a way to reduce the harm of nicotine use. But vaping garbage cooked up in some drug dealer\u2019s garage may be \u2014 surprise \u2014 hazardous to your health.\n\n\u2022 The Environmental Protection Agency plans to repeal the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, an overreaching piece of late-Obama-era regulation that extended the federal government\u2019s oversight of the country\u2019s navigable waters to every irrigation ditch and cow pond from sea to shining sea. The regulatory sleight-of-hand at work involved the concept of \u201csignificant nexus,\u201d here interpreted to mean that the federal government can manage any body of water that ultimately drains into the bodies of water under federal oversight \u2014 meaning, in effect, every body of water. It was a nightmare for farmers and ranchers, who suddenly found themselves under EPA scrutiny over ponds and ditches and other bodies of water that are not only insignificant but temporary. Thirty states, most of them Republican-led, were joined by agribusiness groups in a lawsuit against the rule, while most Democratic-run states sided with the Obama administration and WOTUS. As an editorial in the Capital Press points out, WOTUS was a boon for lawyers, though it did nothing significant for the cause of clean water. If there is a Democratic administration in 2021, it will nonetheless likely be reinstated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Trump is right to end the waiver given to California so that it may set its own carbon-emission rules for motor vehicles. For one thing, the statute creating the waiver was designed to let California deal with its smog problem, not to address global issues such as climate change. And for another, despite its pretensions to federalism, the waiver has served to give California an outsized influence over national policy: Under the Obama administration, the state leveraged the car industry\u2019s desire for a single national standard into an agreement with the federal government under which the nationwide regulations would reflect California\u2019s priorities and car buyers throughout the country would pay the price. Congress has generally preempted state laws in this area so that automakers don\u2019t have to follow 50 different regulatory regimes, and there is no reason California and California alone should have the right to set up a second one.\n\n\u2022 Bad news for our California readers with school-age kids: Effective next year, the state has banned suspensions for \u201cwillful defiance\u201d of teachers in public elementary and middle schools, so the disruptive hellion in your seventh-grader\u2019s classroom is there to stay. Unsurprisingly, a study of earlier suspension bans in California found a detrimental impact on reading and especially math scores \u2014 but the state was clearly undeterred. This is part of a broader trend in the country away from disciplining students out of a fear of racially disparate outcomes; as Parkland dad Andrew Pollack and think-tanker Max Eden explain in their book Why Meadow Died, such fears contributed to the atrocity at Marjory Stoneman Douglas by prompting authorities to look the other way as the future shooter waved one red flag after another. Willful defiance of common sense has unfortunately become a California specialty.\n\n\u2022 The United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany all agree: Iran was responsible for attacks on two important Saudi oil facilities. These strikes resulted in the temporary shutdown of roughly half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production and represented a significant escalation in tensions not just between Saudi Arabia and Iran, but between Iran and the United States as well. The strikes were also a demonstration of Iran\u2019s improved capacity to inflict real harm on its enemies and impede the flow of oil from the Middle East. It\u2019s crystal-clear that the stakes of any conflict in the Persian Gulf are very high. So far the Trump administration is wisely refusing to retaliate on Saudi Arabia\u2019s behalf, and Saudi Arabia has wisely chosen to refuse to respond in kind. Iran is under immense economic pressure from American sanctions, and time is on America\u2019s side. It\u2019s incumbent on the Trump administration to stay the course, continuing to inflict economic pain on the Iranian regime until it\u2019s willing to renegotiate Obama\u2019s dreadful deal. There is no easy path forward, but for now \u2014 in spite of Iran\u2019s obvious and egregious provocations \u2014 war is the least-best course.\n\n\u2022 Mao Zedong set up Communist China in October 1949, and if he were to come back to life he would find that his successors these past 70 years have been as loyal as they could be to his legacy. The structure of Leader for Life, Politburo, and Central Committee remains intact, dictating policy from the top to the bottom. The Party has 90 million members. Mao would certainly approve the senior official who has just explained the anniversary celebrations: \u201cThe purpose is to motivate and mobilize the whole Party, the whole military, and all of the people to unite clearly around the CCP Central Committee with Xi at the core.\u201d The military are expanding throughout the Indo-Pacific region, claiming territory and building harbors and fleets. Dissidence on the part of minorities, the Uighur Muslims or Tibetans, is crushed, and any potential reformer or artist with public appeal must expect a spell in laogai, \u201creform through labor,\u201d the Chinese gulag. Beijing explicitly threatens to use force against the mass protests for human and political rights in Hong Kong. What alone might baffle Mao, though, is the separation of economics from politics, an anti-Marxist-Leninist feature that has somehow developed in China uniquely. Whoever makes a fortune has to be sure to play no part in political life. A recent Beijing University survey found that 1 percent of households hold a third of the country\u2019s wealth while the poorest 25 percent own only 1 percent of it. This corruption is systemic, and let\u2019s hope that before another 70 years it will bring the system down.\n\n\u2022 Beijing has a rule: A foreign government can have relations with it (the PRC) or with Taiwan, but not both. You have to choose. The United States chose the PRC a full 40 years ago, in 1979. Today, Taiwan is recognized by just 15 governments. Taiwan has lost seven since 2016. What happens, as a rule, is that Beijing outbids Taipei when it comes to aid: development money, inducements, or bribes, if you like. The latest governments to switch to the PRC are those of Kiribati, in Micronesia, and the Solomon Islands, in Oceania. The 15 that remain are similarly modest. Will Taiwan \u2014 free, democratic \u2014 be able to remain separate from Communist China? That depends, in significant measure, on the willingness of the United States to make China think that swallowing the island would be more trouble than it is worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Turkey is an ever-tightening dictatorship under Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A man named Burhan Borak has now received the longest sentence ever handed out for insulting the dictator on social media: twelve years and three months. This is for seven posts written in 2014. News reports do not indicate what the posts said. But Turks have been prosecuted for asking such questions as, \u201cWhy does our government fear a play in a theater?\u201d The prosecution, and persecution, of Mr. Borak reminds us of the nature of today\u2019s Turkey \u2014 and of the good fortune that we in free countries enjoy.\n\n\u2022 Israelis either love Bibi Netanyahu, their prime minister this past decade and more, or they loathe him. Either way, he\u2019s conservative. What\u2019s kept him in office so fixedly is the peculiarity of the Israeli parliamentary process. The Knesset, or parliament, has 120 seats, so the prime minister needs a majority of 61 to be able to govern. A two-party system would throw up a winner and a loser, but Israel has proportional representation, an ingenious method of distributing votes so that a majority almost inevitably depends on horse-trading to form a coalition. In elections in April, Netanyahu and his main rival, Benny Gantz, a big-tent liberal, failed to get the numbers. Nine parties ran in this second attempt in September. In an unprecedented move, four Arab parties backed Gantz, but proportional representation still got the better of them. The one and only way out is for Netanyahu and Gantz to fuse the love and the loathing in a government of national unity. Failing that, it\u2019s a third general election in the same year, and perhaps ad infinitum.\n\n\u2022 Russia\u2019s foreign ministry, along with Russian embassies throughout the world, likes to repeat Soviet propaganda on Twitter. These tweets make hilarious reading, but they are serious, too. Recently, the foreign ministry was tweeting about the Nazi\u2013Soviet Pact \u2014 a.k.a. the Hitler\u2013Stalin Pact or the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact \u2014 signed 80 years ago this year. The pact, said the ministry, was an act of mercy on the part of Moscow, protecting vulnerable populations and saving \u201chundreds of thousands of lives.\u201d Timothy Garton Ash, the historian, commented archly, \u201cMolotov would be proud of his old department.\u201d Today\u2019s Russia is not the Soviet Union. But does the Kremlin know it?\n\n\u2022 Gleb Garanich is a veteran Ukrainian photographer. As Radio Free Europe noted recently, \u201che was famously photographed soaked with blood after being struck by a riot policeman during Ukraine\u2019s 2013\u201314 Euromaidan protests.\u201d He continued working that day. In September of this year, he put his camera down to save someone\u2019s life. There had been a gay-pride march in Kharkov, the city in northeastern Ukraine. \u201cWhen the march ended, most of the participants left safely through a nearby subway station,\u201d reported RFE, \u201cbut a crowd of far-right counterdemonstrators had gathered in a neighboring park, apparently on the hunt for LGBT activists attempting to leave on foot.\u201d One of these activists was a \u201cslightly built teenager with a streak of dyed hair,\u201d who tried to \u201cmove through the burly opposition group.\u201d They set upon him \u201camid chants and cheers.\u201d Garanich \u201cshot several photographs of the shocking scene that unfolded in front of him.\u201d Then he stepped in to rescue the victim and, \u201cwithout addressing the mob, simply walked the teen out of the situation.\u201d Hail this name, Gleb Garanich.\n\n\u2022 In 2016, a geriatric specialist at a nursing home in the Netherlands laced the coffee of a 74-year-old woman. The sedative didn\u2019t stop her from struggling as the doctor gave her a lethal injection while relatives held her down. A year earlier she had renewed an advance directive approving euthanasia \u201cwhenever I think the time is right.\u201d At the nursing home she was asked several times about euthanasia. She said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d until her dementia rendered her unable to answer, at which point the doctor and family members answered for her. The public prosecutor took the case to The Hague district court, where judges have acquitted the doctor, ruling that she acted in accord with the \u201cexplicit and serious desire\u201d of the patient, whose last communication on the question, however, was clearly No. Two years ago, more than 200 Dutch doctors signed an open statement against the practice of relying on advance directives to euthanize dementia patients who could not confirm that they wanted to die. Critics say that the doctor crossed a line in this case. It was crossed when the Dutch senate legalized euthanasia in 2001.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Blackface, and minstrelsy, the performance tradition that featured it, bear a freight of white condescension and contempt. They also carried an undercurrent of mimicry and mockery of white culture. Who was laughing at whom? These days, blackface means racism, pure and simple. So when pictures of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau wearing blackface in his twenties surfaced in the homestretch of Canada\u2019s election, they swallowed the news cycle. Objectively, what Trudeau did is trivial; PC rigidly applied would ban an awful lot of costumes, including Halloween ones (one of his dark appearances was as a turbaned Aladdin). At the same time, it is satisfying to see a purebred liberal behaving as liberals imagine only yahoos do. It is, finally, amusing to see Canadians agonizing about blackface, not a significant issue in Canadian history \u2014 the small country trying, yet again, to acquire attention and importance by emulating the problems of its troubled neighbor to the south.\n\n\u2022 Sam Smith, an English singer-songwriter, has declared himself \u201cnonbinary,\u201d meaning that he \u201cidentifies\u201d as neither male nor female. He also announced that he has new pronouns: He wishes to be referred to as \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d In related news, Merriam-Webster added a definition of \u201cthey\u201d: \u201cused to refer to a single person whose gender identity is nonbinary.\u201d Peter Sokolowski, an editor and lexicographer with the company, said, \u201cIf we see that a term is used frequently, then it\u2019s going to get into the dictionary. We wouldn\u2019t be doing our jobs if it weren\u2019t reflecting the truth of the way language is used.\u201d And we wouldn\u2019t be doing our job if we didn\u2019t stand athwart history, yelling Stop.\n\n\u2022 The gender fad is now being extended to the animal kingdom . . . sorry, we mean the animal monarchy. At a London aquarium, the staff somehow deduced that two of their female penguins had formed a couple, so in a fit of wokeness, they gave the pair an egg to hatch and decided that when the baby was born, it would not be assigned a gender. What does that mean, exactly, in the penguin-development context? Will it wear a ball gown every other day instead of a tuxedo? Nope. In fact, it turns out not to mean much at all. The baby bird will not be given a gendered name, and instead of a red or blue tag to identify it as male or female, it will wear a neutral purple one. That\u2019s it. According to the Washington Examiner, aquarium staff admit that the penguins probably don\u2019t know that they are deconstructing gender norms, and that \u201cany future breeding of the [baby] penguin will be determined based on \u2018the gender its biology determines.\u2019\u201d Hmm, biology determining gender? Time for this aquarium to be canceled.\n\n\u2022 Iowa State was hosting the University of Iowa in their annual football showdown, and during the pre-game broadcast, a fan named Carson King held up a sign with his username from Venmo (a cash-transfer website), soliciting contributions so he could buy beer. Within a few minutes, he had $400, and by the end of the game, the total was more than $1,000. King announced that after deducting the price of a case of Busch Light, he would donate all the money he collected to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital. Then the donations really started pouring in. Busch made a generous contribution, as did Venmo; the news coverage spread; more companies and individuals kicked in; and within a week King had raised more than a million dollars for the hospital. Who knew so much good could start with asking for beer money?\n\n\u2022 One of NR\u2019s strengths is the long tenure of many colleagues. Such comes with a downside: When one moves on, it comes as a blow. Kevin Longstreet, longtime ad salesman, life of any party, joy of any office scrum, leaves us after 30-plus years to seek new ventures. He was a favorite of Bill Buckley, who had competition from his wife. Scene from an NR cruise: At the port in Harwich (U.K.), Pat Buckley \u2014 steamed that WFB had gotten them onto the wrong bus (to the Tower of London) \u2014 emerged from a frustrating sojourn and, before scores of gang-planking subscribers, loudly faux-raged that she would seek a divorce . . . to be followed by marriage to Young Kevin. Never refusing a company task, Kevin expressed his willingness. There was always a new NR duty for him: Over the decades, the former NR mailroom jockey and colorful, caper-pulling, street-smart, ready-to-rumble Yankee fan had roles as the right hand to publisher Ed Capano, first mate on scores of NR cruises, successful ad salesman, friend to all. No matter the station of those he encountered, Kevin shared his nature and rogue\u2019s humor, generously and equally, and got the same in return. The anecdotes are legend. Another from an NR sailing: Kevin picked up cruise speaker Karl Rove from a Mexican airport, after which gun-toting cops surrounded and stopped their car, from which sprang Kevin, firing expletives and brandishing intimidation and threats. The federales backed down. On the ship, an admiring Rove regaled the crowd about his new BFF with a talent for getting things done. Deep friendships remain, as do heavy hearts. We wish him godspeed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Cokie Roberts was a fixture in the Washington media for more than 40 years. She grew up there: a daughter of Hale Boggs, the House member from New Orleans (Democrat) who served as majority leader. He died in a plane crash in 1972. He was succeeded in Congress by his wife, Cokie\u2019s mother, Lindy Boggs \u2014 who later, under Clinton, became ambassador to the Holy See. Cokie worked for NPR, ABC, and other outlets. She is looked up to by many political journalists as a \u201cfounding mother.\u201d She was distinguished by her unique first name, professional competence, good cheer, and good looks. One of the raps against her was that she represented the establishment view and the conventional wisdom. In her case, those things weren\u2019t always bad. Cokie Roberts has died at 75. R.I.P.\n\n\u2022 T. Boone Pickens pursued several distinct careers: He began as an oilman, spent the Eighties as what we used to call a \u201ccorporate raider,\u201d launched a hedge fund, and spent the last years of his career as an outright crony capitalist looking to have his businesses subsidized by the federal government in the name of \u201cenergy independence.\u201d His record of achievement was rich if mixed: Most of his high-profile corporate-takeover attempts failed, but they did make him and his investors a pile of money, and the notoriety landed him on magazine covers. He was a generous philanthropist, a sometime advocate of \u201cpeak oil\u201d theory, and a political dilettante \u2014 after toying with a Trump-style run for the presidency in 1988, he grew close to both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and endorsed Rudy Giuliani for president in a 2007 article for National Review. His relations with this magazine were not always friendly: During a visit to our Manhattan offices, he descended into pique when an editor described his \u201cPickens Plan\u201d as a trillion-dollar subsidy for his wind-power and natural-gas businesses being sold under the label of \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d \u2014 which it was. Even the arch-capitalist is vulnerable to the lure of central planning. Dead at 91. R.I.P.\n\n\u2022 \u201cI always say that if you had been there you would have done exactly the same,\u201d Diet Eman told an American audience in 2012, referring to her rescue of Dutch Jews during the Second World War, downplaying her heroism. After Germany invaded the Netherlands in May 1940 and enacted anti-Semitic laws, Eman, 20 years old, secured hiding for a friend who had been designated for \u201crelocation\u201d to a concentration camp. Before long, she had found refuge for another 60, traveling by train and bicycle to sneak ration cards and false ID papers to those attempting to evade Nazi authorities. Arrested by the Gestapo, she spent three months at the Vught concentration camp; her fianc\u00e9 died at Dachau. A serious Christian, she explained in her memoir that she had no patience for the pious claim that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t interfere with what went on because the Occupation itself was God\u2019s will.\u201d President Reagan thanked her for her courage, in 1982. In 1998, Yad Vashem in Jerusalem granted her the title \u201cRighteous among the Gentiles.\u201d Dead at 99. Rest in well-deserved peace.\n\nPOLITICS\n\nThe Ukraine Mess\n\nAfter a year of tap-dancing along the river\u2019s edge, Nancy Pelosi may have crossed the Rubicon. She endorsed a formal impeachment inquiry into the president that will likely lead to House Democrats\u2019 impeaching him.\n\nThe proximate cause is the fact that Trump urged Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who had a lucrative gig on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The political backdrop, of course, is the Biden presidential candidacy.\n\nTrump shouldn\u2019t have raised this with his Ukrainian counterpart. American political campaigns should be American affairs. Yet a presidential act can be wrong, even blatantly wrong, without justifying impeachment. Democrats in the grip of an anti-Trump fever currently are ignoring that distinction.\n\nBut whatever the vulnerabilities of the Bidens, pursuing them is obviously not an appropriate goal of U.S. foreign policy. It would be even worse if Ukraine were presented with a quid pro quo, an investigation of Biden in exchange for U.S. defense aid.\n\nAs we went to press, the White House released a transcript of a key call between Trump and Zelensky that contained no explicit quid pro quo, although Trump did raise the Bidens. The White House is also preparing to give Congress a whistleblower complaint from an intelligence official that got the story going.\n\nThe brewing impeachment fight will inevitably involve questions about the analogous behavior of past presidents. We would want to learn, for example, about the Obama administration\u2019s dealings with Kyiv in 2016, when a Ukrainian investigation involving Trump-campaign official Paul Manafort was suddenly revived, and a leak of documents \u2014 sourced to a Ukrainian legislator tied to the Clinton campaign \u2014 resulted in Manafort\u2019s ouster as campaign chairman. We would also want to learn more about the investigation of alleged Trump\u2013Russia \u201ccollusion,\u201d which appears to have been encouraged by the Obama administration and whose origins are currently being probed by the Trump Justice Department.\n\nWe mention this not to excuse anything Trump has done, or the politicization of American foreign relations. They should be conducted solely on the basis of America\u2019s interests, not those of the president. But Donald Trump would not be the first president to commingle these as if they were one and the same. Now, whether the public considers his conduct truly impeachable will be one of the crucial questions laying the groundwork for the 2020 election.", "description": "Amazingly, Bill de Blasio turned out to be almost as unpopular in Iowa as he is in New York.", "authors": ["Nr Editors", "Kyle Smith", "Kevin D.
