As good as our relationship has been, I think it\u2019s time we start seeing other people. It\u2019s not you. It\u2019s me. No, actually, it IS you.\n\nIn the beginning, you seemed to appreciate me. You always said, \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cGoodbye\u201d when we met or departed. You were always friendly to me and seemed to appreciate my equal part of our relationship. Now, I don\u2019t feel like an equal. You promised me that when you moved in that it wouldn\u2019t affect relationships I had with others. Those days are gone. It seems that lately, you have become cold to me. You no longer greet me with a friendly smile and upon my departure, you are cold and calculated. Once you ran off the other competitors in town, your demeanor changed. I ignored it for a decade or more, but with each passing year, you seem to take advantage of my dedication to you.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that you were kind of like a drug. You provided me most of the things I needed. Early on, I ignored the pleas of your suppliers who claimed you took advantage of them. I ignored the fact that you put many of them out of business by purchasing your products from foreign manufacturers. Some of my friends lost their jobs because of you, but I stayed true to our relationship. I\u2019ll admit some fault there. I hope they forgive me. After all, I was addicted to saving a buck. It was for the family. Now, there aren\u2019t any others because you ran them all off. I was dedicated to you despite how you treated me. Some days, it bordered on being an abusive relationship when you would make me wait forever to get what I needed. I feel like our relationship has become simply transactional.\n\nAll the money you make never seems to get back to our home. Sure, you give the kids a token allowance, but beyond that, you keep all the money for yourself and spend it on your own selfish desires. It seems like everything you do anymore is for your own convenience and not for mine.\n\nYou used to provide me with what I needed but now, I\u2019m not so sure. It seems like more and more, you just want me to have the things YOU want me to have and not just the things I need. You\u2019re so controlling. Time and again, I ask you for things and you are indifferent to my needs. It feels like you just want one thing from me. And now, you\u2019re taking away one of the things necessary for my safety.\n\nIt\u2019s all beyond that now. What matters most is your failure to appreciate my basic need to protect myself and the family. In your arrogance, you fail to provide for my safety buy making irrational decisions with input from your new friends. You think I won\u2019t leave you but you\u2019re wrong. You can\u2019t control me anymore. It may take some time, but I\u2019ll find someone else who appreciates me for who I am.\n\nOnce your dad died, everything changed. You started hanging out with new friends who didn\u2019t share our same values. These are the same friends who won\u2019t be seen with me and my family but yet, you bow to their demands and ignore my needs. Who do you really care about? Your dad would have never allowed you to make the decisions you have nor would he have listened to people like your new friends. The very things he stood for are now the opposite of what you used to believe or so I thought. Sadly, his integrity died with him and apparently was not instilled in you.\n\nYou can have your friends and I\u2019ll take mine. Your new friends think we\u2019re scum, but we\u2019re the very people who made you what you are and now you thumb your nose at us. I thought you were one of us. Maybe you were, but not anymore. We are the heart and soul of your prosperity and you have taken advantage of our goodwill for the last time. We\u2019ll get over you, but it may take some time. Today is the first step. I\u2019m packing my bags and moving out.\n\nI\u2019ll be cordial. I might even be seen with you on occasion when I need something that I can\u2019t get anywhere else. Beyond that though, we\u2019re through. It\u2019s been a nice run. It could have been good, but it\u2019s time we see other people.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised when you see me out with others. They never stopped being who they were. They\u2019ve always been my friends even though I abandoned them for you. Maybe I never really knew you all along but I can say for certain that the person you have become, I don\u2019t like. We\u2019re through.\n\nGoodbye Walmart. It\u2019s over.\n\nSincerely, A Deplorable", "description": "Dear Walmart, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve .09/05/2019 0:09:14AM EST.", "authors": ["Steve", "Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/303/dcab0d07-abc7-42f0-849c-e0504c89dc62.jpg"}
