He asked a judge to decide whether he should accede to House demands for his testimony or to assert \u201cimmunity from congressional process\u201d as directed by Trump.\n\nThe lawsuit came as Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry continued at full speed with a rare Saturday session. Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for Europe, took questions behind closed doors for more than eight hours about Trump\u2019s ouster of the ambassador of Ukraine in May and whether he had knowledge about efforts to persuade Ukraine to pursue politically motivated investigations. Reeker told the lawmakers that he was disturbed by a campaign \u2013 led by Trump \u2013 to oust ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in May and had supported efforts to publicly back her, even though those statements were ultimately never issued by the department.\n\nKupperman, who provided foreign policy advice to the president, was scheduled to testify in a similar session on Monday. In the lawsuit, Kupperman said he \u201ccannot satisfy the competing demands of both the legislative and executive branches.\u201d Without the court\u2019s help, he said, he would have to make the decision himself \u2013 one that could \u201cinflict grave constitutional injury\u201d on either Congress or the presidency.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is rooted in a July 25 phone call Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. During the call, Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to pursue investigations of Democratic political rival Joe Biden\u2019s family and Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election that propelled Trump into the White House.\n\nAt the time of the call, Trump was withholding congressionally approved military aid for Ukraine. He has repeatedly said there was no quid pro quo for the Ukraine investigations he was seeking, though witness testimony has contradicted that claim.\n\nKupperman\u2019s filing says \u201can erroneous judgment to abide by the President\u2019s assertion of testimonial immunity would unlawfully impede the House from carrying out one of its most important core Constitutional responsibilities\u201d \u2013 the power of impeachment \u2013 and subject Kupperman to \u201cpotential criminal liability for contempt of Congress.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, \u201can erroneous judgment to appear and testify in obedience to the House Defendants\u2019 subpoena would unlawfully impair the President in the exercise of his core national security responsibilities \u2026 by revealing confidential communications\u201d from advisers, according to the filing.\n\nHe has asked the court to expedite a decision, but unless the judge issues an opinion by Monday, Kupperman\u2019s testimony might not occur as scheduled.\n\nRejecting his arguments, the three chairmen of the House committees overseeing the inquiry told Kupperman\u2019s lawyers in a letter that the suit was without merit and appeared to be coordinated with the White House. They called the suit \u201can obvious and desperate tactic by the President to delay and obstruct the lawful constitutional functions of Congress and conceal evidence about his conduct from the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe chairmen also said Kupperman\u2019s defiance of the subpoena would constitute evidence in a contempt proceeding as well as additional evidence of Trump\u2019s obstruction of the inquiry. They said they planned to proceed with the Monday session as scheduled.\n\nThe lawsuit came as Democrats investigating the president won a victory in a separate case. A federal judge ordered the Justice Department on Friday to give the House secret grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and affirmed the legality of the Democrats impeachment inquiry. That decision could inform Kupperman\u2019s suit.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump tweeted that he\u2019s \u201cnot concerned with the impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nIn the House deposition, according to a person familiar with the testimony, Reeker told the lawmakers he was disturbed by the effort to oust Yovanovitch, and had supported efforts by some officials in the department to put out statements of support for her in both March, right before she was ousted, and in September, after the effort became public. The person, like others, requested anonymity to discuss the confidential testimony.\n\nIn both cases, Reeker testified that the officials were told by Undersecretary for Political Affairs David Hale that there would not be a statement, according to the person.\n\nReeker also told the lawmakers that he knew the military aid for Ukraine was being delayed and that a White House meeting between Trump and Zelinskiy was being delayed, but in both cases, didn\u2019t know why, according to two people familiar with the testimony.\n\nWhile Reeker had some visibility into the matter, Ukraine is only one country in his portfolio of 50, he told investigators.\n\nLawmakers leaving the meeting with Reeker said he was backing up testimony from previous witnesses, most all of whom have detailed concerns with Trump\u2019s efforts to oust Yovanovitch and said they were wary of Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer who was driving the push for the Ukrainian probes.\n\nWashington Rep. Denny Heck, a member of the House intelligence panel, would not give details about the closed-door interview but said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost startling how much in alignment all of the witnesses to date have been, in terms of their affirmation of the fact pattern. I\u2019m almost taken aback by it.\u201d\n\nAs was the case with other witnesses, the Trump administration directed Reeker not to testify, according to two people familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the interaction. But Reeker appeared anyway after receiving his subpoena from the House, the people said.\n\nAlthough he is currently the top U.S. diplomat for Europe and has been since Yovanovich was recalled earlier this year, Reeker was not directly involved in debate over aid to Ukraine, which other current and former officials have said was delegated to Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and special envoy Kurt Volker.\n\nVolker testified and released text messages that detailed conversations between him, Sondland and William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine. In the messages, Taylor wrote that he thought it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to withhold aid from Ukraine for help with a political campaign. Sondland and Taylor, who still work for the government, have already testified and detailed their concerns about the influence of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukraine. Giuliani was leading the push for the investigations.\n\nTaylor testified that he was told the aid would be withheld until Ukraine conducted the investigations that Trump had requested.\n\n\u2022 Associated Press writers Alan Fram and Eric Tucker contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An ex-White House adviser scheduled to testify before House impeachment investigators on Monday has asked a federal court whether he should comply with a subpoena or follow President Donald Trump's directive against cooperating in what the president dubs a \"scam.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Deb Reichmann", "Mary Clare Jalonick", "Matthew Lee"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/Trump_Impeachment_02898.jpg-af5ee_c0-406-4865-3243_s1200x700.jpg?48c91cdd3c008596a696654b3e314264e47e0a37", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
