Scroll down to walkthrough this unique urban farm.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with airplane food?\n\nIf Singapore Airlines has anything to say about it, that classic stand-up joke will soon be a thing of the past.\n\nThe airline made headlines in 2017 when it announced a new \u201cfarm-to-plane\u201d dining service coming to its long-haul flights, and again this spring when it announced its first sourcing partner.\n\nNow, the locally-sourced, fine-dining initiative is about to launch on the world\u2019s longest flight.\n\nAfter months of planning and preparation, the farm-to-plane service is kicking off next month on the airline\u2019s flight between the New York City-area Newark airport and Singapore.\n\nThe airline will work with AeroFarms, a unique indoor vertical farming company based in Newark, New Jersey, to source leafy greens and vegetables for several of the appetizers in its business class cabin starting in October. Meals made with the local greens will eventually be expanded to other courses and other cabins \u2013 the plane operating the flight is entirely business class and premium economy.\n\nWhile the novelty of the \u201cfarm-to-table\u201d concept in the sky, coupled with the fresh taste of the meals has an obvious appeal, the airline also touts the sustainability of both sourcing ingredients locally, and supporting eco-efficient businesses like AeroFarms with its business. It could be easy to dismiss that \u2013 the airline, after all, is an airline, and relies on fossil fuels to fly emission-generating planes around the world \u2013 but there\u2019s a twofold benefit that sourcing crops from a company like AeroFarms can provide.\n\nNormally, while catering in the winter, \u201cthe greens for our flights from Newark had to be flown in from 3,000 miles away, from California, Mexico, or Florida,\u201d said James Boyd, Singapore\u2019s head of US communications. \u201cThis allows us to instead source our greens from less than five miles away, cutting down on shipping waste.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Singapore is looking to expand the farm-to-plane initiative with similar sustainable urban farms around the world, giving a boost to growing eco-friendly businesses \u2013 for instance, AeroFarms, which said it plans to add more facilities, is a certified B-Corp, a designation given to businesses that meet certain environmental and ethical standards.\n\nBusiness Insider recently toured the AeroFarms facility at Newark to see how everything works. Take a look below for our walkthrough of the facility, and the process of getting the greens from the farm to the skies.\n\nWelcome to AeroFarms.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThis high-tech, one-acre vertical farm can be found at an old steel plant in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThe farm grows a variety of leafy greens and vegetables that will be used in dishes prepared by Singapore Airlines for its flight from Newark Airport to Singapore \u2014 the longest flight in the world.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nDespite its small one-acre footprint, the farm can grow roughly 390 times as much output as a normal farm with the same acreage.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThat incredible output isn\u2019t just because the crops are grown on trays stacked to the ceiling \u2014 it\u2019s because of a unique and proprietary method that AeroFarms uses, based off a technology called \u201caeroponics.\u201d\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nAeroponics is a seemingly simple but cutting-edge growing process.\n\nsource AeroFarms\n\nIt uses a mist of water and air to help crops grow in an environment without soil, pesticides, sunlight, or weeds. Aeroponics farms can grow crops year-round, regardless of season.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nIt starts with a cloth-like material on which seeds are placed, and where the roots will eventually take hold. The material is laid across trays, which are placed into the farm\u2019s growing racks.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nFrom there, the farm uses a mist of water, coupled with nutrients, to start the seeds\u2019 growth.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nInstead of sunlight, the farm uses LED bulbs emitting specific light spectrums, designed to discourage pests, optimize the nutrients the plants get, and even control the flavor of the plants.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nWith this method, AeroFarms can grow mature, ready-to-harvest plants in a fraction of the time of a normal farm.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nWhile baby leafy greens would normally take 30\u201345 days to reach maturity, AeroFarms said that it only takes AeroFarms 12\u201314 days.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThat faster growth means that food can be supplied faster, keeping up with demand while using just a fraction of the energy.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nWithin just a few days, the farm will see its seeds begin to germinate\u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026Begin to grow\u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 Take hold in the cloth medium \u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 And grow \u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 And grow \u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 And grow.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThe farm has a variety of high-tech solutions to optimize plant growth, including computer-controlled misting\u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 Temperature controls \u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 And systems that help manage the growth environment, ranging from fans, controlled air pressure between different rooms, and more.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThe racks of trays resembled a server room in an office, except that each row had plants growing on it \u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 Something you typically wouldn\u2019t see around computer servers.\n\nsource Singapore Airlines\n\nSensors, controls, and backups help ensure that the plants can grow in the best conditions possible \u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 And make it easier to keep track of different crops and growing cycles.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nEmployees and visitors take a number of precautions to avoid accidentally interfering with the growth or contaminating the food-bound plants \u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 Including removing jewelry, entering through a series of pressurized rooms and doorways, and wearing hair nets, gowns, gloves, and more.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThe farm employs about 150 people.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nOnce plants reach a certain point\u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 They\u2019re ready to go into the food supply \u2014 including in Singapore Airlines\u2019 dishes.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nGrowing trays can be taken individually to the harvest room, whenever they\u2019re ready \u2014 unfortunately, we weren\u2019t able to take photos of the process \u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 And then to the packaging room \u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 Where they\u2019re packaged either for bulk delivery to clients like Singapore Airlines, or for retail.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThe growing, harvesting, and packaging operation may be unique \u2026\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 But AeroFarms is planning to expand, hoping to open additional locations.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nBusiness Insider sampled a few different harvested greens, including baby kale, and spicy watercress.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nAfter being packaged, the sky-bound greens are trucked to nearby Flying Food Group \u2014 the caterer that supplies Singapore\u2019s Newark flight, which is about four miles away \u2014 where they\u2019re used for the day\u2019s dishes. The airline said it would start with three appetizers, including a garden green salad, heirloom tomato ceviche, and a soy poached chicken, pictured here.\n\nsource Singapore Airlines\n\nThen, the dishes are brought from Flying Food Group just down the road to Newark Airport, where they\u2019re loaded onto the plane.\n\nsource Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in trying AeroFarms\u2019 produce and you\u2019re located in the New York City metropolitan area, the farm sells packaged goods in local grocery stores under the brand name Dream Greens.", "description": "Business Insider - Singapore Airlines partnered with AeroFarms, an urban farm in Newark that uses \"aeroponic\" farming to grow crops for farm-to-plane dining..
