Most of the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest was declared a national park on August 11th, 1932 during the Second Polish Republic and in 1944 part of the reserve was given to neighbouring Poland.\n\nThe border between the two countries runs through the forest with the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca National Park on the Polish side of the border. Since May 2015 there has been a visa-free regime within the forest for hikers and cyclists.\n\nIn 1992 it was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site and in 1993 it was granted UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status.\n\nIn 2009 the Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park celebrated the 600th anniversary of its reserve status.", "description": "The once immense primeval forest is home to the European bison, the heaviest surviving wild land animal in Europe.", "authors": ["Katy Dartford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/89/26/10/1000x563_cmsv2_8230cbed-7746-587e-bbf4-bf34b3f8f789-3892610.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-24"}
