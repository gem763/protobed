He asks Rudd\u2019s character if it was the first time he\u2019s visited the business. Rudd asks whether if it was his first and Brady responds that it was his sixth.\n\nCOWBOYS' EZEKIEL ELLIOTT AFTER VICTORY OVER EAGLES: 'WE DON'T GIVE A F---K WHAT DOUG PEDERSON SAYS'\n\nHowever, viewers saw the scene as a possible shot at Patriots owner Robert Kraft who was arrested earlier this year and charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution at Orchids of Asia Day Spa & Massage in Jupiter, Fla. He's been in a legal battle over video evidence and police records involving the case.\n\nBrady on Saturday vehemently denied the scene was supposed to be about Kraft and his legal troubles.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what that was about,\u201d Brady told reporters, according to ESPN. \u201cI think that was taken out of context, just like you\u2019re taking it out of context and trying to make it a story for yourself, which has a negative connotation to it, which I don\u2019t appreciate. It was meant to be something different than that. The fact it\u2019s a distraction or you\u2019re bringing it up is not something I want to be talking about.\u201d\n\nCHICAGO BEARS' TARIK COHEN MOCKED OVER HEIGHT DURING GAME VS. NEW ORLEANS SAINTS\n\nBrady said he would never take a shot at Kraft and blamed the media for whipping up a story.\n\n\u201cI think everybody knows what our relationship is about. For 20 years, it\u2019s nothing but love and respect,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot of tough things with him. I love him dearly. I sympathize with a lot of things that he\u2019s gone through in his life. I empathize with a lot of people that get taken advantage of and get used and understand that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re living in.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think it\u2019s this type of media atmosphere that you create. The blame-and-shame media atmosphere that has kind of percolated for a while. I think there's a lot of things that are said that are taken out of context that you choose to make a headline with as opposed to understanding what it's actually about.\u201d\n\nApparently, the cameo by Brady had been organized long before Kraft's massage parlor scandal was uncovered. Timothy Greenberg, the show's creator, believed they would have to scrap the video once the news broke involving Kraft, according to Refinery 29.\n\nMIAMI DOLPHINS' CHRISTIAN WILKINS EJECTED 33 SECONDS INTO GAME VS.

Like, I would have used it as a reference photo,\u201d Greenberg told the outlet. \u201cSo we\u2019re like, \u2018Alright, this is clearly not going to happen now.\u201d\n\nTo their surprise, Brady decided to go ahead with the project anyway.\n\nGreenberg described his feelings on actually having the six-time Super Bowl winner on his show, especially with it being so eerily similar to Kraft's scandal.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"Like, really, something is wrong here.
