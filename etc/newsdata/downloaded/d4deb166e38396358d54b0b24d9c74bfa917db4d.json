Today in a company blog post, the company announced it was shedding Oracle for AWS databases, and had effectively turned off its final Oracle database.\n\nThe move involved 75 petabytes of internal data stored in nearly 7,500 Oracle databases, according to the company. \u201cI am happy to report that this database migration effort is now complete. Amazon\u2019s Consumer business just turned off its final Oracle database (some third-party applications are tightly bound to Oracle and were not migrated),\u201d AWS\u2019s Jeff Barr wrote in the company blog post announcing the migration.\n\nOver the last several years, the company has been working to move off of Oracle databases, but it\u2019s not an easy task to move projects on Amazon scale. Barr wrote there were lots of reasons the company wanted to make the move. \u201cOver the years we realized that we were spending too much time managing and scaling thousands of legacy Oracle databases. Instead of focusing on high-value differentiated work, our database administrators (DBAs) spent a lot of time simply keeping the lights on while transaction rates climbed and the overall amount of stored data mounted,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMore than 100 consumer services have been moved to AWS databases including customer-facing tools like Alexa, Amazon Prime and Twitch among others. It also moved internal tools like AdTech, its fulfillment system, external payments and ordering. These are not minor matters. They are the heart and soul of Amazon\u2019s operations.\n\nEach team moved the Oracle database to an AWS database service like Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), and Amazon Redshift. Each group was allowed to choose the service they wanted, based on its individual needs and requirements.", "description": "AWS and Oracle love to take shots at each other, but as much as Amazon has knocked Oracle over the years, it was forced to admit that it was in fact a customer.
