Don't miss out on that cheeseburger goodness,\" Grey Lines commented.\n\nOne fan gushed: \"OH MY MACCAS!!! Yes, oh man this is probably the best gift ever... does it come with the matching fries scent too?'\"\n\nAnother added: \"When cheeseburgers are life. If I can't eat them, might as well smell them.\"\n\n(Image: McDonalds)\n\nNever a truer word spoken.\n\nIf McDonald's cheeseburgers don't quite do it for you, then Grey Lines have a range of other scents to tantalise your nostrils with.\n\nThese include 'Girls Night In Buttered Popcorn', garlic bread and bacon.", "description": "Your home can now smell of the aroma of McDonald's thanks to a candle with a 30 hour burn time", "authors": ["Zahra Mulroy", "Image", "Bloomberg", "Mcdonalds", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11932408.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Inside-McDonalds-Corp-Newest-Fast-Food-Outlet-In-Russia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-07"}
