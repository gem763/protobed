A couple of Cambridge professors: Mary Beard (classics), Rae Langton (philosophy), plus a lecturer in modern languages, Andy Martin, as chair.

Plus me.\n\nOne of scores of short sessions on big issues, our agenda was \u201cHate Speech, Xenophobia and Trolls\u201d and it is fair to say that we didn\u2019t sort everything out in the 90 minutes or so we were gathered together with a lively and thoughtful audience. A video if the event will be online, so you may judge for yourself, but for myself I felt I learned a few things. Or rather, I learned what I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever understand.\n\nFor example, I got a better insight into the cruel and irrational trolling Mary Beard has been subjected to, and how she has been more concerned for the safety of her students than herself after the death threats she has been subjected to for the crime for having an original mind as well as an incredibly intelligent one.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nShe also reminded the rest of us that \u201cxenophobia\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the hatred of foreigners, but rather fear of foreigners. And thus it turned out was key to the one single question that remained stubbornly unanswered through all our arguments: why?\n\nWhy, as one person in the room asked aloud, is it that people fear \u201cthe other\u201d \u2013 those different to themselves? I guess there are some sociological, anthropological and cultural explanations \u2013 or at least descriptions and accounts \u2013 that shed light on xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia and all the other phobias humankind has been so prey to for so long. There are also examples of societies in which such phobias are far rarer \u2013 though you hear less about those.\n\nIt remains odd \u2013 given the immediate human suffering that these giant phobias have inflicted \u2013 that there is such little understanding of why they are resilient and virulent, and why they so easily infect humanity from one generation to the next.\n\nAfter all, you might think, they are only ideas \u2013 but of course that fact is the key to their very (in this case destructive) power.\n\nWestern societies are often said to be currently engaged in a culture battle rather than a political one based on class, but it might be better thought of as an evolving battle of ideas.\n\nAt the moment, we might agree, the wrong side is making too much of the running.\n\nYours,\n\nSean O\u2019Grady\n\nAssociate editor", "description": "The panel I joined at the Cambridge Festival of Ideas was a distinguished one.
