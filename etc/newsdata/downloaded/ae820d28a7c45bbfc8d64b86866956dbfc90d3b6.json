While fewer people recognized Yang than Biden or Buttigieg, a far greater proportion of them expressed support for him.\n\nYang is possibly the most unique major Democratic candidate in recent history, and his eccentric political brand could provide crossover appeal to any ticket.\n\nAndrew Yang More\n\nScott Morgan/Reuters\n\nYang's message appeals to all types of voters, many of whom are part of his die-hard online base of supporters\n\nWhile Yang is running as a Democrat, his never having held elected office or being formally attached to a political party has given him remarkable latitude to carve out his own distinct political brand.\n\nHis signature policy proposal, the Freedom Dividend, would give $1,000 a month to every American adult in order to help the American economy adapt to the rise of automation and the decline of manufacturing, trucking, and brick-and-mortar retail jobs.\n\nYang's extensive policy platform proposes big expansions in the size and scope of the welfare state, including a \"Medicare for All\" health-insurance system, and he doesn't speak like a typical Democrat \u2014 or even like a politician.\n\nHe frames his policy positions not in the language of politics but by building an economic system based on \"humane capitalism\" \u2014 and welcoming everyone from Democrats to disaffected nonvoters and Trump voters into this campaign with open arms.\n\nOne of his many unofficial campaign slogans is \"not right, not left, but forward,\" indicating how his supporters see his movement as transcending politics itself.", "description": "If Andrew Yang doesn't end up winning the nomination, whoever does should seriously consider tapping him as their running mate.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QR.EapLr0GopPp2QqFcVFQ--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/1b51457295eabeba6f317252080a188e", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
