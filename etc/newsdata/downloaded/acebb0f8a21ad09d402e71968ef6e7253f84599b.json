But to the trucking industry it\u2019s a full-frontal attack, coming as the sector is already dealing with threats ranging from driver shortages, tough new EU labor regulations and self-driving technology that could soon make the trucker an endangered species.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard to survive in the transport sector,\u201d said Yves Haud'huyze, the chief operating officer of Transport Joosen, which dispatches around 200 trucks every day from its base in Antwerp.\n\nHis job is about to get tougher thanks to Ursula von der Leyen and her European Green Deal. The Commission president-elect has vowed to slash the bloc's emissions by 2030 and for the EU to become carbon-neutral by 2050. That means a revolution for trucks.\n\n\u201cThe modal shift implies trucking is bad, and we don\u2019t need it\" \u2014 Matthias Maedge, from the International Road Transport Organisation\n\nRoad freight is responsible for 6 percent of total EU carbon dioxide emissions, and about one-fourth of road transport emissions. The EU's aim is to shift a 30 percent share of long-distance freight transport away from the road and to rail and water by 2030, and more than 50 percent by 2050.\n\n\u201cThe modal shift implies trucking is bad, and we don\u2019t need it,\" said Matthias Maedge, who works on the issue at the International Road Transport Organisation (IRU).\n\nThe goal has been spelled out by the EU since 2011, but so far Brussels hasn't had much success \u2014 the share of road in total inland freight transport has remained stable since the early 2000s, around 75 percent. It is even projected to grow by around 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050, compared with 2005 levels, according to a Commission study.\n\nVon der Leyen\u2019s plans, coupled with growing political and scientific pressure to take more radical action to deal with climate change, is likely to change those assumptions.\n\nTroubled truckers\n\nWith the Green Deal a \u201challmark\u201d of the upcoming Commission, the man given the job of bringing the project to life \u2014 incoming Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans \u2014 is promising legislation within 100 days of the Commission taking office.\n\n\u201cAll sectors of the economy must make a fair contribution to the EU\u2019s climate objectives and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d Timmermans wrote to the European Parliament following questions on the policy agenda. \u201cWe will need to pay specific attention to the transport sector, whose emissions are significant and still rising, and ensure that it is firmly anchored in the European Green Deal.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Brussels making life difficult for road freight.\n\nFrench Ecology (and at the time Transport) Minister Elisabeth Borne announced a plan earlier this year to reduce truckers' tax break on gasoline by 2 cents per liter, and pour the earnings into infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice that\u2019s both ecological and fair,\u201d Borne said.\n\nHer announcement outraged the transport industry. \"This is all a terrible blow to small- and medium-sized road transport enterprises,\" said Catherine Pons, general delegate of the road freight transport federation, UNOSTRA.\n\nFuel tax breaks for truckers also hang in the balance in Italy, as the country's new coalition government mulls phasing out subsidies that run counter to climate goals \u2014 part of its very own Green New Deal.\n\n\"We're paying a road tax, but we're getting nothing, nothing in return\" \u2014 Yves Haud'huyze, chief operating officer of Transport Joosen\n\nBut that would be a \u201cresounding own-goal for the state,\u201d according to Paolo Ugg\u00e8, vice president of the Conftrasporto transport federation, as it would indiscriminately target both polluting and cleaner trucks.\n\nA road charge for truckers that Belgium rolled out in 2016 also met with criticism. Making trucks pay while passenger cars don't amounts to \"no more and no less than a covert tax,\" Transport Joosen\u2019s Haud'huyze said. To circumvent traffic jams and save on fuel, his firm has taken to driving at night.\n\n\"We're paying a road tax, but we're getting nothing, nothing in return,\" he said.\n\nThe push to clean up trucks comes as the industry is already dealing with a host of existential challenges.\n\nDearth of drivers\n\nLong hours, low pay, tough regulations and traffic congestion make trucking an unattractive career.\n\nIndustry groups launched a call for action in September to fill the increasing number of vacancies in the sector. The problem is set to worsen, as the average driver is a 44-year-old man. Attracting young people and women to the job has proved difficult.\n\n\"No one is currently still happy to take to the road,\u201d said Haud'huyze.\n\nThe acute shortage of drivers has brought Germany\u2019s transport industry to \"the brink of supply collapse,\" lobby groups warned earlier this year in a joint call asking politicians not to reduce their funding. \u201cReducing subsidy programs in such a situation ... would be fatal.\u201d\n\nThe sector\u2019s alarm comes as the EU is preparing measures to curb cross-border trucking operations and improve working conditions some say are under attack from cheap competition from the bloc's east. Opponents of the reform say the rules will further reduce the EU\u2019s dwindling trucker numbers by making it tougher for Poles and Romanians to ply their trade across the Continent.\n\nAs trucking companies look to meet the challenges, many have pinned their greening hopes on \u201cmega-trucks\u201d \u2014 longer and heavier vehicles that transport the same loads with fewer vehicles. They are already in service in some EU countries, including Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany and Spain.\n\nBut the spread of higher-volume trucks has been slowed by safety concerns and doubts about their climate benefits, as well as fears that they'd slow down the transition to barges and trains by boosting road freight volumes.\n\nThere\u2019s also self-driving technology and the idea of allowing autonomous vehicles to fall in line behind a manned lead truck. Germany has been trialing so-called platooning convoys along a 150-kilometer stretch of Bavarian highway since last year.\n\nHowever, the industry fears a push by the EU and national governments to make trucking more expensive as a way to shift freight to water and rail could undermine the economics, preventing it from adopting greener technologies.\n\nHaud'huyze, who calls himself a \u201ctransporter through and through,\u201d is the first to admit he didn\u2019t pick an easy profession.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re better off starting a sandwich shop,\u201d he said.\n\nJoshua Posaner contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
