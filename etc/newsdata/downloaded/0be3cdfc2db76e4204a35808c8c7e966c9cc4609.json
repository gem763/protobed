How prepared are cities to serve their older residents? Based on a report released today, Age-Forward Cities for 2030, the answer seems to be: not very.\n\nBut, according to the report\u2019s authors, Nora Super and Caroline Servat at the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging, a few large and small U.S. cities get it and have launched practical initiatives to become more age-friendly. They include New York City, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, West Sacramento, Calif., Louisville, Kansas City, Mo., Washington, D.C., Chicago and Tampa, Fla.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some progress, but many cities aren\u2019t paying attention to aging,\u201d said Super, senior director of the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging. Successful aging in America\u2019s cities has been a major focus for the Center for the Future of Aging in recent years.\n\nAdded Servat, the Center\u2019s associate director: \u201cWe found mayors rarely mentioned older adults in connection with the economic growth of their communities. That\u2019s a missed opportunity.\u201d\n\nWhy aren\u2019t there more age-forward cities?\n\nWhy are so few cities and their leaders working to be age-forward? As my earlier article on the paucity of age-friendly cities noted, it typically doesn\u2019t seem urgent to them. \u201cPopulation aging is a slow moving challenge,\u201d said Servat.\n\nThe Center\u2019s challenge to cities and their leaders: getting them to move aging to the top of their policy agendas.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Have you started saving for your parents\u2019 old age?\n\nBecoming age-forward isn\u2019t just a nice idea for cities and their older residents. It\u2019s a necessity.\n\nAlready, eight in 10 U.S. residents 65 and older live in metropolitan areas; the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging calls cities \u201cground zero for the demographic shift.\u201d But, the report says, \u201crealizing the benefits of an older population \u2014 while addressing the difficulties and realities \u2014 will be one of the great human challenges of the 21st century.\u201d\n\nThe urgency of becoming age-forward is why the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging made 2030 a goal for cities. \u201cWe see this as a call for action to invest in solutions to employ the human and social capital of older adults,\u201d noted Servat.\n\nKey priorities according to urban experts\n\nFor its report, the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging asked 146 experts on aging, public health, urban planning and related issues to rank in importance age-forward priorities and strategies. Among their conclusions:\n\nThe most critical policy intervention for city leaders to better prepare for the future of aging by 2030: housing that is safe and affordable.\n\nThe best ways to shape employment opportunities for older people: flexible work arrangements, skills training and broader access to employment programs.\n\nThe economic development strategy most critical to address the challenges of population aging in cities: expanding age-friendly commercial districts and housing developments.\n\nThe home-health and home-care field is unlikely to find enough workers to fill the coming need by 2030.\n\nWhat some age-forward cities are doing\n\nA few examples of age-forward cities featured in the report, and insights shared exclusively with Next Avenue by some of their initiatives\u2019 leaders:\n\nLos Angeles: The city and county have embarked on an ambitious regional Purposeful Aging project to make the area the \u201cbest place to grow old in the world,\u201d said Laura Trejo, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Aging. It will include more affordable and accessible transportation; safer streets and sidewalks; preparing the health care industry\u2019s workforce for the aging population; prevention and responses to wandering among people with dementia.\n\nRelated: Governor Gavin Newsom has big plans for aging Californians\n\nWashington, D.C.: Its seven-year-old Age-Friendly DC initiative includes a Safe-at-Home program with home adaptation grants to help residents age in place; zoning revisions allowing Accessory Dwelling Units (where, say, parents can live in small homes on the property of their adult children); construction of more than 500 units of below-market-rate housing for older residents including ones for those raising grandchildren.\n\nTampa, Fla.: The city is partnering with the Florida Department of Health create the nation\u2019s first Age-Friendly Public Health System. \u201cAs the state with the largest proportion of older adults, it is no wonder that Florida was selected to pilot\u201d that initiative,\u201d said South Florida gerontologist Kathy Black.\n\nAlso read; An analysis of the Social Security COLA for 2020\n\nAnd Tampa is working with Humana to test out the Miami-based \u201cGrandkids on-demand\u201d startup, Papa, pairing young adults with Medicare beneficiaries to help with household tasks.\n\nKansas City, Mo.: The older adult population is growing faster than any age group here, but Kansas City is losing boomers and preretirees. So, the Mid-America Regional Council has been working on ways to make the metro more age-friendly, including applying an \u201cage-lens\u201d to city, parks and strategic plans. \u201cOlder adults still have a lot to contribute as workers and volunteers,\u201d said Cathy Boyer-Shesol, project manager for KC Communities for All Ages of the Mid-America Regional Council.\n\nThe BoomTown idea for intergenerational neighborhoods\n\nThe report also featured the Gensler Research Institute\u2019s \u201cBoomTown\u201d holistic, intergenerational communities model, showing how the Macarthur Park and Ivy City neighborhoods of Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., respectively, could be transformed to support all age groups.\n\nThe D.C. proposal, for instance, would create hubs for health care, work, public space, residences and education; improve transportation for access to hospitals, colleges and recreation; and provide affordable housing embracing inclusivity and diversity.\n\nTama Duffy Day, a principal at the Gensler architectural firm, told me \u201cat the moment there is no plan for these ideas to become reality,\u201d but that her firm would \u201cwelcome any opportunities to expand our thinking into any community and/or neighborhood.\n\nAlso see: The 401(k) retirement is coming \u2014 are you prepared?\n\nOf course, money can help make a city age-forward. But, the Milken Institute researchers found, serving older residents requires more than that.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t just take capital. It takes an all-hands-on-deck approach,\u201d said Servat. \u201cThe first step is for cities to realize there is value in approaching their aging population as part of the solution to the many challenges they\u2019re already looking it.\u201d", "description": "How prepared are cities to serve their older residents?
