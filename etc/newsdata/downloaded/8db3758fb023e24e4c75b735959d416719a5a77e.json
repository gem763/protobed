WeWork's wide losses and other details in the filing prompted NYU professor Scott Galloway to nickname the company \"WeWTF.\" The real-estate billionaire Sam Zell told CNBC on Wednesday that \"every single company in this space has gone broke.\"\n\nSimonetti is concerned that the focus on WeWork's model will taint the public's perception of the space as a whole.\n\n\"Bill Clinton has a great quote that says, 'Don't focus on the headline, focus on the trend line,'\" he added.\n\nThe headline is WeWork and its S-1, he said, but the trend line should be that how companies use real estate is fundamentally changing to an outsourcing model.\n\n\"I think all of us are now strategically seeing that and then saying, for us and our core customers, what's the best way for us to build a business,\" he said, referring to how companies could be reassessing long-term commitments to real estate.\n\nConvene paints itself as \"commercial real estate's first workplace-as-a-service platform.\" (\"Platform\" is a word WeWork likes too \u2014 it mentioned it 170 times in the S-1.) It was founded in 2009 by Simonetti and Chris Kelly, who wanted to bring their experiences investing in hospitality and real estate to office space.\n\n\"The thesis was really: What if you ran an office building like a hotel?\" Simonetti said.\n\nConvene started with event space and conference offerings, and has now grown to flexible workspace, culinary, and health and wellness offerings. Convene recently announced that it would be partnering with the primary-healthcare startup Eden Health, with one clinic already open in a Convene space in midtown Manhattan.\n\nSimonetti sees Convene as a plug-and-play option for landlords who are looking to provide more amenities in their space.\n\nRead more: Industrious' CEO tells us why the coworking startup is ditching leases and managing property instead. Bigger rival WeWork is eyeing a similar pivot to help erase losses\n\nConvene's 2018 fundraise brought the company's valuation to more than $500 million, according to Bloomberg. Convene is still dwarfed by WeWork, but Simonetti hopes that the focus on the bigger company won't distract away from the larger story of a change in the workplace.\n\n\"This industry doesn't start and end with WeWork (or coworking) nor does it change the trendline,\" Simonetti wrote over email on Thursday after the media reports of WeWork possibly taking a massive valuation hit.\n\nRoughly a quarter of Convene's locations are management partnerships with landlords, where the company is paid a fee to operate space but doesn't actually pay a lease to a landlord. This is similar to how established hotel brands operate.\n\nSimonetti says that three quarters of Convene locations are leased but that the leases are partnership leases where the landlord puts up capital for renovations. While this model reduces risk by taking the lease off of Convene's balance sheet, it can be less profitable.\n\n\"At scale, I think the multiple is higher for a more asset-light, capital-light business, but it doesn't necessarily mean that your valuation is going to be higher,\" he said.\n\nWhile Convene may be touting a partnership strategy, it is not alone. Industrious, which recently raised $80 million, is attempting to make management partnerships a majority of their business by 2020. WeWork is also looking to increase the proportion of their spaces under management partnerships.", "description": "Ryan Simonetti talked about the public reaction and \"negative price cycle\" around WeWork's financials.", "authors": ["Alex Nicoll"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d714dce2e22af7e2969b9c3-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
