Former Obama administration officials, for instance, are now desperately urging their Party's presidential candidates to stop advocating for controversial open-borders immigration policies.\n\nDuring a recent interview with CNN\u2019s David Axelrod \u2014 who himself served as a senior advisor to Obama \u2014 former Attorney General Eric Holder emphasized the importance of enforcing America\u2019s immigration laws, arguing that the Democrats \u201chave to understand that we do have to have borders,\u201d because \u201cborders mean something.\u201d\n\nBut Holder wasn\u2019t finished. When asked if he supports \u201cdecriminalizing\u201d unlawful border crossings \u2014 an outrageous proposal that is rapidly gaining traction on the left \u2014 Obama\u2019s former attorney general promptly replied, \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, the law that is on the books has been there for about 100 years now or so,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt might send the wrong signal, but it would certainly take a tool away from the Justice Department that it might want to use for an individual case and for some reason.\u201d\n\nHolder isn\u2019t the only seasoned Democrat to criticize the progressive stance on immigration in recent weeks. John Sandweg, a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the Obama administration, told BuzzFeed News last month that he objected to the liberal attacks on President Obama\u2019s deportation practices, pointing out that Obama tried only to deport convicted criminals and people apprehended in the act of crossing the border illegally. Sound familiar? It\u2019s just that when President Trump enforces existing laws, it represents an opportunity for the 2020 Democrats to score political points.\n\nFormer Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also recently admitted that decriminalizing border crossings is a horrible idea \u2014 especially when it comes to the Democrats\u2019 electoral prospects.\n\n\u201cThere are so many more important things to do,\u201d Reid told VICE News. \u201cDecriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list. It should be way, way down at the bottom of the list. People want a fair immigration system. They don\u2019t want an open-door invitation for everybody to come at once.\u201d\n\nOld-school Democrats such as Holder, Sandweg, and Reid \u2014 as well as former Obama DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, who was among the first to challenge his Party\u2019s increasingly radical stance on immigration \u2014 are now distinctly in the minority within the contemporary left, though. Radical progressives and so-called \u201cdemocratic-socialists\u201d have taken control of the Democratic Party, and they\u2019re steering it away from the political center and straight towards the rocky shoals of political extremism. Former Vice President Joe Biden was even forced to defend Obama\u2019s immigration agenda from a relentless blitzkrieg of liberal outrage, despite the fact that Obama was further to the left on immigration than any president in American history.\n\nThe full-throated embrace of open borders by Democrat presidential candidates will prove to be its downfall in the 2020 presidential election \u2014 and long-time Obama allies know it.\n\nPolling has consistently shown that open-borders policies, such as decriminalizing illegal border crossings and granting amnesty to illegal immigrants, are deeply unpopular \u2014 even among Democratic voters. Republicans, of course, are almost unanimously in favor of securing America\u2019s borders, but perhaps the most worrying revelation of all for the Democrats is that independent voters tend to agree with the GOP on this issue.\n\nThe Democrat candidates are staking the outcome of the 2020 election on their radical open-borders immigration policies. That approach might be popular on the far-left fringe of the electorate that dominates the primary contests, but the only Democrats with any experience winning national elections \u2014 and with managing a border crisis \u2014 know that it will be political suicide for their nominee to defend such a deeply-reviled proposal during the general election.\n\nArt Del Cueto is Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council.", "description": "The 2020 Democrats have lurched so far left that even .09/20/2019 1:06:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Art", "Del Cueto", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/113/09637b18-204b-4cde-9f11-d124417b0497.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
