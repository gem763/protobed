While it has only just recently become everyone\u2019s favorite \u201ctrendy\u201d health drink, kombucha has been around for millennia.\n\nKombucha originated in the Far East, with the first recorded use coming from China in 221 BC. Back then, it was called the Tea of Immortality. For centuries afterward, it was enjoyed throughout Eastern Europe and Asia, but it wasn\u2019t until around the year 415 that it became known as \u201ckombucha,\u201d named after a doctor named Kombu (Kombu + \u201ccha,\u201d which means \u201ctea\u201d).\n\nHeading into the 20th century, kombucha fell out of favor until after World War II, when a physician in Germany gave it to his patients to treat various conditions, including high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nToday, you can\u2019t enter a grocery or health food store, or even convenience market, without seeing kombucha in the refrigerated section.\n\nWhy the surge in popularity?\n\nWell, for one, its fizzy, tangy, slightly sweet and sometimes fruity flavor is a light and refreshing alternative to many of the other trendy beverages out there.\n\nBut, it could very well go hand-in-hand with the newfound awareness and appreciation of the microbiome\u2014the diverse array of bacteria that inhabit the gut and play a key role in good health, digestion and immunity.\n\nOver the past decade or so, in an effort to support a healthy and robust microbiome, the use of probiotics has surged. Not only are Americans taking probiotic supplements, they\u2019re eating more and more fermented foods, which are naturally very rich in probiotics. Kombucha, a fermented beverage, is packed with these beneficial bacteria. When consumed, the microbes line the digestive tract, support the immune system, and fight illness, infection, and disease.\n\nHealth Benefits of Kombucha\n\nPreliminary research on kombucha\u2019s health benefits is impressive. While more human studies need to be done, here is where some of the strongest potential lies\u2026\n\nGut Health: Obviously, the greatest advantage to drinking kombucha is improved gut health due to the robust presence of friendly bacteria. Studies show that kombucha contains high levels of probiotics ranging from Gluconacetobacter and Lactobacillus to Acetobacter.1\n\nLactobacillus, in particular, is associated with reduction of gastrointestinal conditions (C. difficile infections, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, etc.) and vaginal infections. Gluconacetobacter, on the other hand, is known to produce glucaric acid and saccharic acid, which have detoxification and anti-cancer properties.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nHeart Health: Kombucha can decrease levels of cholesterol that are linked to heart disease. In a 16-week study on rats that were fed cholesterol-rich diets, those that were also given kombucha had significantly lower total, LDL, and VLDL cholesterol, and higher HDL. Liver and kidney function also improved.2\n\nLiver Protection: Antioxidants in kombucha help fight free radicals that cause cellular damage. The liver is one organ easily affected by free radicals. But research shows that the antioxidants in kombucha can lessen oxidative stress and liver toxicity and could be beneficial against liver diseases.3\n\nBlood Sugar Control: Findings of an animal study revealed that kombucha tea was a better suppressor of blood glucose than black tea. The researchers wrote that, \u201cKombucha tea can be considered as a potential strong candidate for future application as a functional supplement for the treatment and prevention of diabetes.\u201d4\n\nOther Benefits: Other possible benefits of kombucha include antimicrobial and antibacterial properties, weight loss, enhanced immune function, treatment of the lung disease silicosis, and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases and cancers.5\n\nTo Make or To Buy?\n\nFor all its potential health benefits, there is one drawback to kombucha: Many store-bought varieties contain unnecessary additives. Sugar is an essential ingredient in the creation of this beverage. But the fermentation process reduces the sugar content to almost nothing\u2014it\u2019s a naturally low calorie, low carb and low sugar beverage. But a lot of kombuchas have added sugar and other additives to enhance or sweeten the flavor.\n\nIf you buy a brand off the shelves, be sure to check the label and choose a kombucha that has limited ingredients. Better yet, make your own kombucha. This allows you to fully control the ingredients and sugar content.\n\nThe process is surprisingly easy, though it does require a bit of patience. Here\u2019s how you do it.\n\nWhat You Need\u2026\n\n1 large glass jar (at least one gallon) with a wide opening\n\n1 thin dish towel or cheese cloth\n\n1 rubber band\n\n8 cups filtered or distilled water\n\n\u00bd cup organic cane sugar (most of it gets \u201ceaten up\u201d by the bacteria)\n\n4-6 bags of organic black or green tea (you don\u2019t want to use anything flavored or herbal\u2014it can damage the SCOBY)\n\n1 SCOBY \u201cmushroom\u201d (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast) A SCOBY is a biofilm of microogranisms that resembles a mushroom cap. It is made of acetic acid and various bacteria and yeasts and is an essential starter for brewing kombucha. You can buy a SCOBY online in kombucha starter kits and in many health food stores. But often times people will give them away for free. Because, with each new batch of kombucha the SCOBY replicates itself, active brewers will typically have more SCOBYs than they need.\n\n1 cup of premade or store-bought organic, unpasteurized kombucha\n\nDirections\u2026\n\nBoil water in a pot. Once boiling, turn off heat and add sugar (1 \u2013 1\u00bc Cups per gallon). Stir until the sugar dissolves then add your tea bags (4-6 tea bags per gallon of water). Steep the tea for 15-20 minutes, then discard the tea bags. Allow the tea to cool to room temperature. Once cool, pour the tea into the jar. Add the SCOBY disk as well as the pre-made kombucha. (Note: you only need the pre-made kombucha for your very first batch\u2026thereafter, you\u2019ll just leave a little kombucha from the last batch in your jar when you add your brewed tea for the next batch) Cover the jar with the towel or cheese cloth and secure with a rubber band. Allow to sit and ferment on your counter for about seven days (and up to a month). After about a week, taste your brew \u2013 once it\u2019s slightly sour but still slightly sweet, it\u2019s time to bottle it for the \u201csecond fermentation\u201d. Pour your kombucha into (preferably) glass jars or bottles with a tightly sealed lid or cap. As the fermentation process continues in the sealed container, the carbon dioxide produced will get dissolved into the kombucha producing the delightful trademark effervescence.\n\nSave one cup of this kombucha to use for future batches, and refrigerate and enjoy the rest.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
