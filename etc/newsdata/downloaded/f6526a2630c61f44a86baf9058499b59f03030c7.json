A pharmacist is a man or woman who, first of all, can read a doctor\u2019s handwriting (a rare skill!) \u2013 and a man or woman who gives you the medicine that\u2019s been prescribed to you. Nothing more to it right? Wrong.\n\nThe role of a pharmacist\n\nPharmacists are more than just \u201cmedicine cashiers\u201d \u2013 they are qualified health professionals that play an important role in the medical ecosystem.\n\n\u201cOnce a patient has been to a doctor or specialist and has received a diagnosis and treatment plan, pharmacists are the last healthcare professionals to have contact with the patient,\u201d Boipelo Modise, a registered pharmacist at Medipost Pharmacy, tells us.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our duty to ensure that each patient has the correct treatment for the right condition and the right dose for the correct duration.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions that exist about pharmacists is that they simply issue whatever medicine a doctor prescribes.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to assess the prescription to make sure that they get the correct treatment for their condition and that the prescribed medicine is safe for use for each specific patient,\u201d he explains.\n\nREAD MORE: Essential Items Every Woman Needs To Have In Her Medicine Cupboard\n\nWhat can you ask?\n\nSo then, what are some of the questions that we can ask a pharmacist that we don\u2019t necessarily need a doctor for? Well, pharmacists can answer any medicine-related questions. A pharmacist can also advise on ailments and whether over-the-counter medication can provide relief or if the patient needs to consult with a doctor.\n\nWith that said, here are the questions you can ask a pharmacist exclusively:\n\nCan I take this medication if I suspect I could be pregnant?\n\nIs it safe to drive while taking this medicine?\n\nCan I share my medication with my friend or neighbour?\n\nWhat time of day should I take my medicine?\n\nDo I need to eat before taking medicine?\n\nIs this medicine safe to use with alcohol?\n\nCan I throw my expired medication in the municipal rubbish?\n\nWhere should I keep my medicine?\n\nREAD MORE: 7 Lies You Really Need To Stop Telling Your Doctor\n\n\u201cThe pharmacist can also inform patients of any new treatments available in the market, and advise the patient about cost-effective generic medicine options,\u201d Modise explains.\n\nOver and above that, pharmacists can also tell you if your condition is self-limiting (the condition will resolve itself without the need for treatment). And they are also able to refer you to other health professionals.\n\n\u201cIn short, you can ask your pharmacist anything and we will assist as far as we can because ultimately, we are here to help you.\u201d\n\nThe best part about it is that it\u2019s completely free. The next time you\u2019re at a Dis-Chem counter fetching your medicine, maximise the time you have with your pharmacist and ask all your burning questions \u2013 you will get answers!\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Best part?
