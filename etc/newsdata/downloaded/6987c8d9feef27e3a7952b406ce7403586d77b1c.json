I used their cars to transport stuff to the venue in Leeds, my grandma helped out with sewing material for me to have on the floor.\n\n\u2018The feedback was amazing. I thought, \u201cIf I can sell this many tickets in a week how many will I sell in a month?\u201d\u2018\n\nFaye uses clubs across Leeds, hiring them during the day when they are usually empty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then creates themed raves for parents to enjoy as much as the children.\n\nAt first, she hired the sound system and lights but as the company grew, she reinvested the money to buy the equipment.\n\nFaye and Ziah (Picture: PA Real Life)\n\nNow they have a snow machine, bubble machine and disco lights to create the ultimate party atmosphere and charge on average \u00a36 for an adult and child, and \u00a32 for additional children to take part.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had a Take That versus a Spice Girls rave, and reggae, rock, old school, trap, metal, RnB themes. We\u2019ll do a Halloween remix and in August we held a Pride rave, where everybody came dressed in rainbow colours,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a question of working out what people want and adapting it.\n\n\u2018We react to the crowd and change things up if we need to, which is why it\u2019s so good. They last between one to three hours.\n\n\u2018The kids get a real confidence boost from it. It\u2019s good to help bring children out of their shells.\n\n\u2018We cater for the child\u2019s development, but also tap into what the adults like. It could be that they recognise the songs, which gives them a bit of who they were back before they became Mum and Dad.\u2019\n\nAfter a friend suggested she could do with a more permanent base, especially as she was acquiring more equipment, in April, Faye took over a unit in a warehouse in Leeds after raising \u00a37,000 using crowdfunding to get it off the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs well as hosting baby raves at festivals, BoomChikkaBoom holds mini raves and activity days in shopping centres, drama classes, messy play sessions, cinema screenings for parents and children, and themed events for Halloween, Mother\u2019s Day and Christmas.\n\nAnd, after a suggestion from one of the parents, they now host raves at care homes and respite centres for adults with learning disabilities.\n\nFaye has also branched into high end children\u2019s birthday parties, hosting one for Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy\u2019s daughter at their Surrey home.\n\n\u2018We did a rave in their back garden, with an inflatable igloo,\u2019 Faye recalled.\n\nNow Faye employes 10 members of staff and is booked out until January.\n\nShe added: \u2018We are still investing in the company so having our own venue is stepping it up a notch.\n\n\u2018I never had a business plan for this, I never set out to do this and really make money from it. It was something to do while I had a baby because there was nothing else like it.\n\n\u2018As a parent, I still go to the events the company hosts when I\u2019m not running them, because I know I will like it.\n\n\u2018I thought it would be for a short time while I had my son, but I\u2019ve built it up and now I\u2019m so passionate about it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Irn Bru relaunches original 1901 recipe with extra sugar\n\nMORE: Boohoo and CoppaFeel! team up to launch bras that show how to check your boobs\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Faye Kenny, 32, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, created BoomChikkaBoom after giving birth to her son Ziah.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91413548_1571824517.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
