Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). For more than two years, she had been a loud and lonely voice in that effort. She told me during a \u201cCape Up\u201d interview in 2017, \u201cWhy would we let somebody like Trump, a con man, come in here and turn it all upside down with his lies and his disrespect? And so, I personally feel very strongly about this and I\u2019m going to keep working until he\u2019s impeached.\u201d\n\nWell, on Sept. 24, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) put the wheels in motion for an impeachment inquiry after revelations that Trump pressured the new president of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election by investigating former vice president Joe Biden. The notes on the phone call between the two leaders in July combined with a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about that conversation and other actions guaranteed such a constitutional remedy.\n\n[Nancy Pelosi has a responsibility. With impeachment, she intends to fulfill it.]\n\n\u201cThe Constitution never envisioned anything like this,\u201d Waters told me in the latest episode of \u201cCape Up.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t envision everything, but who would have thought that a president of the United States would use his personal lawyer, disregard all of his Cabinet, all of his staff, disregard all of his foreign advisers, and cut deals.\u201d As the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Waters is one of what I call \u201cThe Impeachment Six,\u201d the six chairs of the six committees already investigating the president that will now be involved in the impeachment inquiry. She explained how things are going to work.\n\n\u201cIt is not six separate committees doing this work, it is six committees who have been involved in investigations for some period of time, who were going to put all of their information on the table with the speaker and come out with the articles of impeachment that will be turned over to the judiciary committee,\u201d Waters noted. \u201cAnd then the judiciary committee will do what the Constitution says they should do. They\u2019re the ones who will go through the articles of impeachment and vote on it and decide whether or not it should be voted out of their committee.\u201d\n\n\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) speaks with The Post's Jonathan Capehart on Capitol Hill on Sept. 26. (Jonathan Capehart/The Washington Post)\n\nAs for specific articles of impeachment, \u201cwe\u2019re going to honestly evaluate what we have, where the facts are the hardest,\u201d Waters said. \u201cWe want the strongest articles of impeachment that we could possibly put together.\u201d But don\u2019t expect this inquiry to drag into the 2020 election. \u201cWe are all committed to moving this process very quickly, and the further away from the election it is, the better it is,\u201d Waters insisted. \u201cGetting into the elections at the same time that you\u2019re doing the impeachment is confusing, and we don\u2019t want that kind of confusion.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t think Waters and the Democrats are alone in wanting Trump impeached. \u201cA Republican member whispered in my ear, \u2018Don\u2019t stop, you go ahead and you get him,\u2019\u201d said Waters about a conversation she had on the House floor moments before sitting down with me in her Capitol Hill office last Thursday. About an hour earlier, at the 2019 Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, former Arizona senator Jeff Flake, a Republican, told the audience, \u201cI heard someone say if there were a private vote [on impeachment in the Senate] there would be 30 Republican votes. That\u2019s not true. There would be at least 35.\u201d\n\n[Maxine Waters: \u201cI'm so offended by this president that I think it requires me to speak truth to power.\u201d]\n\nListen to the podcast to hear Waters discuss Trump\u2019s pernicious impact on the presidency and the Republican Party. And listen to her discuss to my and her utter amazement the people who most want to take a photo with her these days.\n\n\"I get stopped by white men more than anybody else. I just came out of South Carolina. I took pictures with white men in the airport, on the airplane,\u201d Waters shared. \u201cWhite men have normally been the ones who just couldn\u2019t take me. . . . They have threatened to kill me, and all of that. So I am surprised, I\u2019m very surprised.\u201d\n\n\u201cCape Up\u201d is Jonathan\u2019s weekly podcast talking to key figures behind the news and our culture.
