It's a company-wide problem, and it's one that Comcast NBC needs to take seriously and demonstrate that they're taking seriously,\" Thomas said outside NBC\u2019s famed 30 Rock.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEight Democrats have qualified for the November debate so far: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen.
