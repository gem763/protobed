Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Thursday night, and declared that humankind needed to eat babies to prevent climate change.\n\nSpeaking with an accent reminiscent of Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s Borat character, the woman said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be here much longer, because of a climate crisis. We only have a few months left. I love that you support the Green [New] Deal, but it\u2019s not going to get rid of fossil fuel. It\u2019s not going to solve the problem fast enough.\u201d She added that Americans should \u201cstart eating babies\u201d and \u201cbomb Russia\u201d as preliminary steps to save the planet.\n\nOcasio-Cortez reacted passively, and later tweeted that the woman may suffer from a mental condition. But it was a prank, which might have been obvious to anyone familiar with Jonathan Swift\u2019s famous 1729 satirical essay, A Modest Proposal\u2014in which he argued that the problem of poverty in Ireland might be alleviated if the poor sold their children to the rich for food. \u201cA young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee, or a ragout.\u201d\n\nProgressives and environmentalists are dismissing the prank, noting that it appears to have been carried out by a pro-Trump political action committee dedicated to the rehabilitation of eight-time presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche, who has promoted the view that 9/11 was an \u201cinside job,\u201d that global warming isn\u2019t real, that black people didn\u2019t really create Jazz music, that the Beatles were created by the \u201cBritish Psychological Warfare Division,\u201d and dozens of other conspiracy theories.\n\nBut whatever the discredited nature of the source, the substance of prank itself was a brilliant send-up of the apocalyptic and Malthusian character of today\u2019s environmental extremism, and the hypocritical nature of those who advocate for it.\n\nEnvironmentalists insist that developing nations adopt renewable energy sources, enhance energy efficiency, and adopt a low-energy lifestyle\u2014even though no poor nation can develop without high levels of energy consumption. So while the Norwegian government produces natural gas in Mozambique and Tanzania, it is simultaneously participating in a European push to prevent those same countries from building their own natural gas power plants.\n\nClimate extremists also have successfully pressured the World Bank and other financial institutions to reduce financing for poor countries seeking to expand their energy production. In 2014, for instance, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, sought to cut off U.S. development funding to poor nations seeking to build hydroelectric dams, on the basis that such dams have a \u201cnegative impact\u201d on river ecosystems. \u201cIf Senator Leahy is so adamantly against hydropower,\u201d wrote a development specialist, \u201clet him show his commitment by first turning out the lights of Vermont.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a report that rests heavily on the idea that poor nations can grow rich while using radically less energy. \u201cPathways compatible with 1.5\u00b0C that feature low energy demand,\u201d IPCC officials said, \u201cshow the most pronounced synergies and the lowest number of trade-offs.\u201d The IPCC also repeated a debunked claim that poor nations can \u201cleap-frog\u201d rich nations with solar panels, batteries and energy efficiency, and promoted \u201cbio-energy\u201d\u2014the use of wood, dung and ethanol\u2014fuels that are not only uneconomical, but also happen to come with their own hugely negative environmental impacts. In truth, energy consumption is as tightly coupled to per capita GDP today as it was when today\u2019s rich nations were themselves poor.\n\nPerhaps the greatest hypocrisy is for people like Rep. Ocasio-Cortez and Swedish student climate activist Greta Thunberg to seek to shut down nuclear power plants while claiming the end is coming from climate change. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez has endorsed the closure of Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York, which will be replaced with natural gas, while Thunberg attacked nuclear energy on Facebook as \u201cdangerous.\u201d And yet nuclear energy provides the majority of carbon-free electricity in the United States and over 40% of total electricity in Sweden.\n\nThe most doctrinaire and apocalyptic forms of modern \u201cenvironmentalism\u201d are simply a repackaging of the ideas of Thomas Malthus, the 19th-century British economist who thought that there were too many poor people out there\u2014particularly poor Irish people\u2014and that the ethical thing to do was let them die. \u201cInstead of recommending cleanliness to the poor, we should encourage contrary habits,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand court the return of the plague.\u201d\n\nUnlike Swift, Malthus was no satirist. He was making a utilitarian argument: If we let the poor reproduce they would just end up creating more suffering in the future. (Indeed, the British government and media used Malthus\u2019 ideas to justify the policies that led to mass starvation in Ireland from 1845 to 1849.) The LaRouchian protestor who spoke at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s thursday event channeled Malthus\u2019 horrifying logic faithfully. And in a more polite form, environmentalists channel it themselves when they urge that poor countries shoot themselves in the foot economically so that the world might be a greener place.\n\nAfter World War II, prominent American progressives drew on Malthus\u2019 ideas to oppose development aid and nuclear energy, and promote coerced sterilization. Cheap energy, prominent scientists feared, would lead to overpopulation, deplete scarce resources, and destroy the environment. Humankind \u201cwould not rest content until the earth is covered completely, and to a considerable depth, with a writhing mass of human beings, much as a dead cow is covered with a pulsating mass of maggots,\u201d the chemist Harrison Brown wrote in his 1954 book, The Challenge of Man\u2019s Future.\n\nAnti-humanist ideas came full bloom in Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich\u2019s 1969 Sierra Club book, The Population Bomb, which depicted poor people in India as animals \u201cscreaming\u2026begging\u2026defecating and urinating.\u201d Two decades later, the United Nations seemed to embrace elements of neo-Malthusianism in a report called Our Common Future. Rather than move to fossil fuels and nuclear, the UN experts opined, poor nations should instead use wood fuel more sustainably. And \u201cwood-poor nations must organize their agricultural sectors to produce large amounts of wood and other plant fuels.\u201d (Ironically, the lead author of Our Common Future was Gro Brundtland, former Prime Minister of Norway, a nation which just a decade earlier had become fabulously wealthy thanks to its abundant oil and gas reserves.)\n\nMalthusian hysteria has become embedded in all sorts of extremist sects. Indeed, two recent mass shooters\u2014one in El Paso, Texas, and the other in Christchurch, NZ\u2014echoed some version of the apocalyptic rhetoric of Malthusian environmentalists. Yet Malthusian environmentalists are preaching a debunked creed, for their prophet wrongly predicted that famines and resource scarcity would become common features of a densely populated world. Instead, technology has outpaced increases in population and consumption\u2014so that today we face the prospect of reducing the total amount of natural resources (including land) required to sustain us.\n\nThe power of Swift\u2019s original parody was that it motivated readers to consider the values of the person proposing such schemes. This week\u2019s hoax may have a similar effect when it comes to the most extreme forms of environmentalist rhetoric. Indeed, the hoaxer wasn\u2019t wrong when she said that a Swedish scientist really had floated the idea of eating the human dead as a means to help save the planet.\n\nIf we are to believe Rep. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s claim that humankind has only 12 years left to save civilization from climate change, then surely the truly more modest proposal of operating today\u2019s nuclear plants while pursuing the French and Swedish model of building standardized nuclear power plants, would be warranted.\n\nIn seeking to calm the woman, Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cOne of the things that is very important to us is that we need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present\u2026Luckily, we have more than a few months.\u201d For once, she sounded like a voice of reason. It would be nice if she\u2014and her fellow environmentalists\u2014made it a habit.\n\nMichael Shellenberger is a Time Magazine \u201cHero of the Environment,\u201d and president of Environmental Progress, an independent research and policy organization.
