The lawsuit was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nWalmart alleges that \u201cyears of gross negligence\u201d and \u201cfailure to live up to industry standards by Tesla\u201d sparked the blazes and led at least seven locations to close temporarily over the last seven years. Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cthe occurrence of multiple fires involving Tesla\u2019s solar systems is but one unmistakable sign of negligence\u201d\n\nTesla has installed solar panels at more than 240 Walmart locations, but lawyers for the retailer write in the complaint that \u201cthe occurrence of multiple fires involving Tesla\u2019s solar systems is but one unmistakable sign of negligence.\u201d Walmart alleges in the suit that Tesla didn\u2019t ground its systems properly, that the solar panels installed at Walmart sites were defective, and that Tesla didn\u2019t keep proper documentation of the systems.\n\nAccording to Walmart\u2019s suit, the problems started with SolarCity before Tesla acquired the solar panel company in 2016. SolarCity had \u201cadopted an ill-considered business model that required it to install solar panel systems haphazardly and as quickly as possible in order to turn a profit, and the contractors and subcontractors who performed the initial installation work had not been properly hired, trained, and supervised.\u201d\n\nWalmart claims that Tesla has failed to provide a complete set of \u201cfinal \u2018root cause\u2019 analyses needed to identify the precise defects in its systems that caused all of the fires.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe number of defects, however, is overwhelming and plainly indicative of systemic, widespread failures by Tesla to meet the standard of care, as set forth in the governing contracts, as to the solar systems installed at Walmart\u2019s stores,\u201d lawyers for Walmart write.\n\nWalmart says it \u201cdemanded\u201d that Tesla disconnect all of its solar panels after three fires broke out in 2018 in Ohio, Maryland, and California. Tesla complied, according to the complaint, but Walmart says another fire broke out anyway at a second California store.\n\nThe news comes just a few days after Tesla relaunched the website for its residential solar program and announced a new rental option.", "description": "The retail giant filed a lawsuit in New York state against Tesla, alleging that the energy company\u2019s solar panels caused fires in at least seven stores dating back to 2012.
