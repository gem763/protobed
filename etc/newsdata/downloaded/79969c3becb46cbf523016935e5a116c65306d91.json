However, she was one of the thousands of Thomas Cook employees to lose her job last month and the family are worried about paying for any investigation. The fundraising page set up to repatriate Spray\u2019s body has now passed \u00a320,000 and any remaining money will go to his father\u2019s battle against prostate cancer.\n\nSpray\u2019s family want an independent inquiry following his death last Monday, ahead of England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifying game against Bulgaria.", "description": "Pressure is growing on the Foreign Office and Bulgarian police to launch an investigation into how Rob Spray, a 32-year-old England football supporter, died in custody, as his family wait to find out when his body will be returned home.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Tom Morgan", "Football News Correspondent", "Sports News Correspondent", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/17/213315133-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqp9No3JumEPlXhPROJZWLgtb665IFwaUATzvW0IUud4I.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
