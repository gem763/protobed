But D.C. people don't care because they want mass migration. https://t.co/8kqHk86XTB \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 29, 2019\n\nThe amnesty legislation will likely be welcomed by progressives even though it will cut the marketplace wages for Americans and for H-2A farmworkers and will also reduce the economic incentives for investing in new labor-saving machinery or techniques, such as vertical farms.\n\nBut the amnesty side of the bill would help Democrats by creating a new immigration path for at least 150,000 workers and their families each year. The new inflow will add to the current inflow of 1.1 million legal immigrants who help suppress wages and raise real-estate prices, and it will help turn more GOP-held districts in Democratic blue.\n\nThe lead GOP legislator backing the bill is Washington state Rep. Dan Newhouse, who owns fruit orchards in Washington state. The bill is likely to be backed by a small number of GOP legislators from dairy districts. The farmers in their districts want cheap migrant labor because milk prices are low, robotic cow-milkers are expensive, and the cost of migrant labor is rising in President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d economy.\n\nThe bill mandates the use of the \u201cE-Verify\u201d program to exclude illegal aliens from the agriculture sector. That mandate gives legislators a talking point to be used against voters who oppose the amnesty. But Section 303 of the bill effectively kills the existing E-Verify program before the promised rollout of a to-be-designed replacement program.\n\nThe bill does not include any compensation for Americans who will face lower wages \u2014 and receive less workplace investment in machines \u2014 once the agriculture industry can import a replacement army of lower-wage labor.\n\nThe bill does not include subsidies for the robots or other labor-saving technology that could reduce the incentives for farm companies to hire many illegal aliens or H-2A visa workers.\n\nThe farmworker bill mimics Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee\u2019s \u201cFairness for High-Skilled Immigrants\u201d legislation. Lee\u2019s bill has already been passed by the House as H.R.1044, and it offers a green card subsidy to an industry that uses cheap imported labor to bypass American graduates. Lee\u2019s S.385 legislation, however, has been stopped in the Senate by Sen. Dick Durbin, who wants a bigger increase in immigration.\n\nMany American farms still rely on stoop labor, long after the industrial revolution of the 1800s.\n\nNext time you enjoy radishes in your salad, remember the farmworkers like these Oxnard workers, who harvest the food that we eat. #WeFeedYou #Calor #Ovetime4FarmWorkers pic.twitter.com/mjICn0nnta \u2014 United Farm Workers (@UFWupdates) September 9, 2018\n\nThe U.S. farmers\u2019 reliance on cheap labor has reduced their incentive for the use of machines, while farm companies in many other countries are increasing their competitive advantage by investing in machines:\n\nSo far, the White House has shown little interest in the amnesty bill, partly because it does not want to trade away unpopular concessions before a major workforce deal in 2021. The McClatchy news service reported October 28:\n\nLast week, Theo Wold, a special assistant to President Donald Trump for domestic policy, came to Capitol Hill to meet with members and senior aides involved in negotiations. Wold is an ally of Jared Kushner, a senior adviser and son-in-law to Trump who has tried to be a bipartisan dealmaker on immigration overhaul legislation in the past. Congressional sources familiar with the meeting said they saw Wold\u2019s participation as a positive sign there could be some openness to support for the bill within the White House \u2014 or at least no active effort to try and thwart it. A senior administration official confirmed Wold\u2019s attendance but said the White House is unlikely to back the legislation.\n\nThe Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) is opposing the bill. \u201cThe name of this mass amnesty bill name should be changed to the Mandatory Farm Labor Act of 2019,\u201d FAIR said.\n\nIf the Farm Workforce Modernization Act was true to its name, it would focus on automation (mechanization loan guarantees, perhaps?) This would be an important step in eliminating industry dependence on cheap foreign labor. #aglaborflyin19 \u2014 FAIR (@FAIRImmigration) October 29, 2019\n\nFarm groups are welcoming the subsidy of cheap labor:\n\nCORRECTION: America's farmers, ranchers, and growers urge their congressional members to give them an endless supply of cheap foreign labor. #aglaborflyin19 https://t.co/9EIYPltNz4 \u2014 FAIR (@FAIRImmigration) October 29, 2019\n\nThe bill is backed by companies in the fruit and berry business:\n\nFarmers, ranchers and growers urge congressional members to support the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, which provides meaningful #aglabor reforms that will help the U.S. agriculture industry. #aglaborflyin19 pic.twitter.com/ILuZqaKtLU \u2014 USApple (@usapples) October 29, 2019\n\nApple harvesters rely on migrants to pick the fruit by hand:\n\nLike apples?
