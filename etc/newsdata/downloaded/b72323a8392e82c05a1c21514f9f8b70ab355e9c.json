Seems like a simple question. Constitutionally speaking, it also appears to have a simple answer: to cite and remove from power a president guilty of wrongdoing.\n\nAye, there\u2019s the rub. What sort of wrongdoing warrants removal from power?\n\nI\u2019d wager that the flames of impeachment were stoked more this week by President Trump\u2019s foreign policy than they have been by any purported impeachable offense his opponents have conjured up over the last three years.\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: RECORD SUPPORT FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT\n\nBy redeploying a few dozen American troops in Syria, the president acceded to a Turkish invasion of territory occupied by the Kurds. Ostensibly, that has nothing to do with the impeachment frenzy over Ukraine, whose government Democrats accuse the president of pressuring to dig up dirt on a political rival. But Turkey\u2019s aggression could crack the president\u2019s impeachment firewall.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThere is rage over Trump\u2019s decision. It is rage over a policy choice, not over high crimes and misdemeanors.

Nor does it matter much that, while excruciating, the president\u2019s decision is defensible and will be applauded by Americans weary of entanglement in the Muslim Middle East\u2019s wars (as I discussed in a column on Thursday).\n\nWhat matters is that President Trump has damaged his support among Senate Republicans. How badly remains to be seen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY", "description": "By redeploying a few dozen American troops in Syria, the president acceded to a Turkish invasion of territory occupied by the Kurds.
