Then they started to say the opposite: \u2018no, we still believe in you,\u2019 [some] were saying that my time has already gone. It\u2019s normal. When you lose, everybody says his career is almost over, he will never come back. When you start to win everybody starts saying \u2018we have been believing in you since the beginning.\u2019 So it\u2019s a normal part of any sport.\u201d\n\nThe player who has managed to beat several top players this year, including Roger Federer, stressed that he hasn\u2019t set any particular goals for the season, except for demonstrating a stable game at every tournament.\n\nAlso on rt.com Andrey Rublev & Swiss tennis icon: Who clobbered Roger Federer in Cincinnati?\n\n\u201cThere were no goals and like I said many times before, I don\u2019t really have goals,\u201d the player said. \u201cMy main goal is to do my best every day especially outside the court, [during] practices. Every day to try to improve the things that I need to improve. Because if I do it well and I improve I will do better at tournaments. If I do better at tournaments I will win more matches. If I win more matches my ranking would be higher. Everything comes together,\u201d he added.\n\nRublev also praised his compatriot Daniil Medvedev for his phenomenal run to world number three, admitting that the US Open finalist is in a better shape right now.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Unstoppable\u2019 Medvedev seems destined for even greater heights \u2013 and that means taking down Djokovic, Nadal & Federer\n\n\u201cEverybody knows his [Medvedev\u2019s] style. He is a really good player who doesn\u2019t really miss the ball, who can play in a good rhythm and [move] with a good speed. He can play without missing, without giving you many opportunities to attack. He defends and serves very well. So basically he does many things very good,\u201d Rublev told RT.\u201cNow he is much better than me, he has beaten me this year a couple of times. I have to work hard to do my best [to beat him]\u201d he added.", "description": "Russian tennis ace Andrey Rublev has opened up about his sensational return to professional sport revealing that many fans almost \u2018buried\u2019 his career when he was forced to sit out the entire season due to a back injury.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da8660c20302714784c31cd.png", "published_at": "2019-09-01"}
