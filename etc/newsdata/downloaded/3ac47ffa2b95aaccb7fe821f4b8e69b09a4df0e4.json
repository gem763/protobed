The issue led to the resignation of TSB's CEO Paul Pester.\n\nMany market infrastructure services and technology that banks use are outsourced and the review said firms cannot use third party failures as an excuse when incidents occur, drawing attention to suppliers of cloud computing.\n\n\"The consequences of a major operational incident at a large cloud service provider, such as Microsoft, Google or Amazon, could be significant,\" the review said. There is a considerable case to regulate cloud service providers.\n\nWith bank branches and cash machines disappearing, more than 70% of adults rely on digital services, leaving them vulnerable to IT glitches such as those also seen at Barclays and Visa last year, parliament's Treasury Select Committee (TSC) said in its review.\n\nLawmakers said they accept that completely uninterrupted access to banking services is not achievable, but that prolonged or regular IT failures are unacceptable.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England must take action, said Steve Baker, the lawmaker that led the review.\n\n\"They should increase the financial sector levies if greater resources are required, ensure individuals and firms are held to account for their role in IT failures, and ensure that firms resolve customer complaints and award compensation quickly,\" Baker said.", "description": "Many market infrastructure services and technology that banks use are outsourced and the review, by the United Kingdom parliament's Treasury Select Committee, says firms cannot use third party failures as an excuse when incidents occur.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105727580-1549615532232gettyimages-923317900.jpeg?v=1572229187", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
