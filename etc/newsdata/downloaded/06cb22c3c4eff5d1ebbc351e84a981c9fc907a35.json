General Assembly were denied visas by the U.S., effectively preventing them from traveling this week to the international organization\u2019s headquarters in New York.\n\n\u201cThis is an outrageous example of disrespect by the United States of America for UN members, as well as failure to fulfill its obligations as a country hosting the world organization,\u201d Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a Facebook post.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would likely discuss the issue with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York, Ms. Zakharova added.\n\nA spokesperson for Department of State told The Washington Times that visa records are confidential under U.S. law and that the agency is thus unable to discuss individual cases.\n\n\u201cWe evaluate each visa application on a case-by-case basis, consistent with existing laws and obligations,\u201d said the State Department spokesperson.\n\nReports of the U.S. denying visas to the delegation emerged nearly a month since two American lawmakers critical of Mr. Putin\u2019s policies \u2014 Sens. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, and Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat \u2014 similarly complained about being unable to participate in a recent trip to Russia organized by members of Congress.\n\nMs. Zakharova subsequently told reporters that both senators were barred from entering Russia because their name appears on a blacklist established in response to similar travel sanctions imposed by the U.S.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
