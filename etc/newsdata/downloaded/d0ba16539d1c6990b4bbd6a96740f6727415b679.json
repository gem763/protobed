Rasky, currently the CEO of lobbying firm Rasky Partners, served as a spokesman for Biden\u2019s two prior presidential campaigns. He had been among the allies of the former vice president who recently had discussed creating a pro-Biden super PAC.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden\u2019s 2020 team said it would no longer consider super PACs unwelcome, with campaign officials tying the reversal to Republicans spending millions of dollars in an attempt to derail the ex-veep. Super PACs are controversial, as critics say they subvert limits on campaign donations. Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals have blasted his campaign\u2019s shift on these groups, with Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign saying it\u2019s \u201can effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations.\u201d\n\nThe reversal on super PACs comes after Biden only ranked fourth in the 2020 Democratic field in third-quarter fundraising, even as he generally leads in national polls. His relatively low Q3 haul of $15 million has left him with less money in the bank than other top-tier candidates.\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC, Biden portrayed the push for a super PAC as a \u201cgrassroots response\u201d to President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on him. \u201cThis is an understandable response from Democrats who desperately do not want to see him re-elected president. My guess is they would have done the same thing for anybody who was attacked in the Democratic primary if they were leading,\u201d Biden told the cable news channel.", "description": "A former aide to Joe Biden has signed paperwork to form an independent fundraising group to support Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, with the move coming...", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU262_biden__ZG_20191029161544.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
