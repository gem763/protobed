Some thought she was attractive. She was running for Congress, and she got elected, and some tweets came out. She posed nude when she was 14 or 15,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe was outraged. \u2018How dare you!\u2019 I said, \u2018What do you expect to happen? You put a picture of yourself nude on Facebook or MySpace or, you know, my butt, whatever it is. Somebody\u2019s gonna find that stuff,\u2019\u201d he continued.\n\nLimbaugh\u2019s claims were incorrect in a few ways. For one, Ball didn\u2019t get elected. And there was no controversy about nude photos. Likely what Limbaugh was recalling were some saucy, but clothed, party photos of an adult Ball and her then-husband that made the rounds online during the 2010 campaign.\n\nThe conservative commentator went on to contend that the Ball incident led to others using \u201cblackmail\u201d against members of Congress. He added that \u201cRepublicans can do this too\u201d \u2015 apparently referring to threatening people \u2015 and may be doing it in \u201ccertain places.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Ball addressed Limbaugh\u2019s allegations during her Hill TV show, \u201cRising,\u201d as well as on Twitter.\n\nThe MSNBC alum said she \u201cdid not pose nude when I was 14 or 15,\u201d adding that \u201cFacebook and MySpace did not even exist when I was 14 or 15. I didn\u2019t tweet about anything related to that.\u201d\n\nIn his \u201cvery bizarre way,\u201d Ball suggested, Limbaugh was probably alluding to those party photos.\n\n\u201cIn the Trump era, this was so minimal that it was party photos that he felt the need to make this much more salacious in order to titillate his audience,\u201d said Ball, who is now 37.\n\nShe emphasized that because Limbaugh has an audience of millions, she decided to use her own platform to set the record straight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like he can just slime whoever he wants and get away with it with no accountability. But if I did have some naked photos from when I was 14 or 15 or whenever, who frickin\u2019 cares?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your job to be the moral police or to shame me or any other young woman who is out there who may have nude photos that come out. If they want to run for office, if they want to be political leaders, they still can,\u201d said Ball. \u201cI wanted to make sure that I was able to put that out there.\u201d\n\nBall\u2019s Twitter thread explained the chain of events and included a video of her broadcast.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want this slut-shaming smear just hanging out there,\u201d she wrote in one post.\n\nSo I have some sort of weird personal/public news. The other day on his show, Rush Limbaugh went on at length about how I posed nude when I was 14 or 15 (I did not.) I've been thinking for a few days about how to deal with this. Partly I didn't really want to call more attention. \u2014 Krystal Ball (@krystalball) September 12, 2019\n\nMaybe just ignore it and move on. But the reality is, his show has millions of listeners and the transcript is readily available online. I didn't want this slut-shaming smear just hanging out there. I'm also lucky enough to have a platform to set the record straight. \u2014 Krystal Ball (@krystalball) September 12, 2019\n\nBut maybe the next person who get's smeared will not. I didn't want him to think he could just slime anyone with impunity. Most importantly though, if I did \"pose nude\" at 14, so fucking what? Should women be barred from public service because they have bodies and sexuality? \u2014 Krystal Ball (@krystalball) September 12, 2019\n\nLimbaugh doesn't get to be the morality police and I won't stand by when slut-shaming is being used to undermine yet another woman, even when that woman is me. Here are his full comments and my full response. Also for the record @esaagar is the greatest. https://t.co/uV3jU9MjDu \u2014 Krystal Ball (@krystalball) September 12, 2019\n\nBall\u2019s \u201cRising\u201d co-host, Saagar Enjeti, backed her completely and even suggested she could pursue legal action against Limbaugh.\n\n\u201cHe should know about America\u2019s libel laws and that you would be fully within your rights in order to go after him,\u201d said Enjeti.\n\nOn Twitter, many others rallied to show their support for Ball:\n\nThis is incredible and important. Good for you @krystalball https://t.co/yP0frRAkn1 \u2014 andy lassner (@andylassner) September 12, 2019\n\nProud to work on a show with a strong woman like Krystal who is not afraid to stand up to assholes like Rush Limbaugh. It's 2019, we're far past the point where slut-shaming should be tolerated. https://t.co/6RnjYGrqL9 \u2014 Tiffany Hudson (@TiffanyRHudson) September 12, 2019\n\nKrystal you\u2019ve got what Limbaugh never will: class, depth, & integrity.\n\n\n\nHe admitted to a crime. If confronted by law enforcement his smartest defense would be that he made it up.\n\n\n\nShame on the radio stations airing a man who says he looks at nude pix of kids. \u2014 David Cay Johnston (@DavidCayJ) September 12, 2019\n\nSending support and love. https://t.co/kzsOMnOFkv \u2014 Marc Lamont Hill (@marclamonthill) September 12, 2019\n\nThank you for speaking out and Fuck that guy. https://t.co/h1qxvsKYki \u2014 Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) September 12, 2019\n\nAfter Ball\u2019s public statements, Limbaugh backtracked slightly on what he\u2019d said.\n\n\u201cI was under the impression that when she ran for Congress ... some nude photos of her from social media had surfaced. Well, it turns out that that wasn\u2019t quite true,\u201d he said on his Thursday broadcast.\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cI honestly thought it was \u2015 \u2019cause I remember she got very upset that these pictures, she was very mad, and you, I remember, well, what do you expect? You know, you go on social media, you do whatever, somebody\u2019s gonna find it and it\u2019s gonna surface. It turns out they were party photos. Whatever it was, she was upset about.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh reiterated his point that \u201cthere isn\u2019t any privacy on social media, particularly if you run for office, people are gonna dive into it\u201d and argued that he wasn\u2019t slut-shaming Ball.\n\n\u201cPeople who engage in social media, who desperately want to be famous, you\u2019re gonna get it. You want to be famous, people are gonna find a way to find out what you did. I was \u2015 no moralizing at all. You think I\u2019m gonna be upset about some woman appearing nude somewhere? No! That\u2019s not gonna bother me,\u201d he said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Ball and Limbaugh have been at odds. In 2012, Ball launched a website, Boycott Rush, that called for a boycott of advertisers on Limbaugh\u2019s show following his incendiary comments about Sandra Fluke.\n\nFluke, then a law student at Georgetown University, was invited by Democrats to speak at a hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on so-called conscience clause exceptions for birth control coverage in health insurance plans.\n\nLimbaugh talked about the hearing and Fluke in a broadcast afterward, calling her a \u201cslut\u201d and a \u201cprostitute.\u201d He was condemned by public figures on both sides of the aisle and later issued an apology, but not before nearly 100 advertisers dropped out of his show.\n\nHuffPost has reached out to Ball, Limbaugh and Hill TV for comment on Limbaugh\u2019s recent claims.\n\nThis story has been updated with Limbaugh\u2019s comments following Hall\u2019s criticism of him.", "description": "Krystal Ball spoke out on her Hill TV show and Twitter about the conservative radio host's sexist and false accusations.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7a7d453b0000c49fd19d91.png?cache=0zjnxenyix&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
