One lawmaker thinks that the committee could be compromising its mission.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re clearly looking to ram this thing through as quickly as possibly. The calculation is that this will be better for them politically and they want to get it done in time to hurt the president as we approach the 2020 election,\u201d Rep. Michael Waltz told Fox News.\n\nThe Florida Republican said he agrees with other Republicans that the committee\u2019s chairman Adam B. Schiff is politically biased and his appointment to lead the impeachment inquiry should be called into question.\n\n\u201cRep. Schiff has made his agenda clear and that is to impeach the president. This is the same person who pounded the table that he had beyond-circumstantial evidence that the president had colluded with the Russians \u2014 which we have now seen to be false,\u201d Mr. Waltz said. \u201cMeanwhile, he\u2019s leading an intelligence committee with oversight of the intelligence community \u2014 while we have China stealing our secrets left and right. We have huge issues that we should be dealing with within the intelligence committee. And we\u2019re not because it\u2019s essentially become the impeachment committee.\u201d\n\nOh, but it\u2019s complicated. And dramatic. A look at major headlines from the last 24 hours reveals all.\n\n\u201cSchiff, House intel chairman, got early account of whistle-blower\u2019s accusations\u201d (The New York Times); \u201cMcCarthy signs on to resolution to censure Schiff for parody reading of Ukraine call\u201d (Fox News); \u201cPelosi fiercely defends impeachment inquiry as Trump blows up\u201d (Politico); \u201cWhy Trump wants Schiff arrested for treason, explained\u201d (Rolling Stone); \u201cSchiff: Deeply concerned by potential Pompeo interference\u201d(CNN); \u201cTrump Calls Schiff a \u2018low-life\u2019 who should resign\u201d (Bloomberg); \u201cTrump committed an impeachable offense just by threatening Adam Schiff\u201d (The Week).\n\nNOT OVERLOOKED: REPUBLICAN CIVILITY\n\n\u201cAll of us at @TeamTrump offer @BernieSanders our prayers and wish him a speedy recovery.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Wednesday morning tweet from Tim Murtaugh, director of communications for President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, following news that Sen. Bernard Sanders had called off his campaign events following surgery and hospitalization for a heart condition.\n\nMORE PEEVED AT THE PRESS THAN TRUMP\n\n\u201cVoters are mad at President Trump and his political opponents. But they\u2019re angriest at the media these days,\u201d says a new Rasmussen Reports survey released Wednesday.\n\nIt found that 53% of all likely U.S. voters are angry with Mr. Trump while 49% are peeved at his political opponents. The poll revealed, however, that 61% are mad at the media.\n\nSo there you go. For the moment, Mr. Trump is outpolling the press. How about that? The survey of 1,000 likely voters was conducted Sept. 29-30.\n\n\u2018U.S. ELECTION-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX\u2019\n\nWe already know that 2020 is predicted to be a $10 billion election. But wait. The war chests have opened, and this electoral money extravaganza has already begun. A new AdAge analysis reveals that the \u201cdeluge\u201d of TV and radio ad spending has already hit $148 million, a bill run up \u201cmostly by inevitable losers,\u201d the research noted.\n\nDemocratic billionaire Tom Steyer leads the pack at the moment, having shelled out $19.6 million through late September, followed (distantly) by Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who spent a mere $1.6 million. Two interest groups are tied in third place. The Judicial Crisis network has dropped $1.2 million, as has The Need to Impeach.\n\nDemocratic hopefuls in the presidential, congressional and gubernatorial races are currently making 44% of the ad buys, spending a total so far this year of $65 million. That includes $27 million on the White House bout.\n\nRepublicans are in for 35% of the spending, for a total of $51 million. The amount includes $31 million for governor\u2019s races \u2014 but only $2 million on the presidential race so far.\n\nAll of these dollar signs are \u201cjust a portion of the cost of the ridiculously drawn-out, outrageously wasteful U.S. election-industrial complex,\u201d writes AdAge columnists Simon Dumenco and Kevin Brown, who point out that Election Day in over a year away \u2014 and extend their sympathy to media consumers who must endure the onslaught of much negative campaigning.\n\nNO LONGER THE GOLDEN STATE\n\nMore than half of California voters have thought about moving out of the state, according to a new poll from the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\u201cA full 74% of the state\u2019s very conservative voters say they\u2019re looking into moving, and 84% of those cite California\u2019s political culture as their rationale for leaving. Unsurprisingly, the high cost of housing is mentioned by 71% of California voters who have considered moving out-of-state,\u201d reports Chuck Devore, a contributor to The Federalist and a former member of the California State Assembly.\n\n\u201cWhen conservatives leave California and other states dominated by the left, they tend to move to states with lower taxes and like-minded people. Increasingly, these states are also the ones generating the highest employment growth, such as Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Texas,\u201d writes Mr. Devore.\n\n\u201cWhile America is at risk of becoming even more polarized over time, due to the decennial reapportionment, liberal states are also at risk of losing electoral clout to places that care more about family, hard work, and talent than ideology,\u201d he observes.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 69% of registered U.S. voters \u201cstrongly support\u201d President Trump\u2019s nomination for reelection; 75% of conservatives, 73% of Republicans, 54% of moderates and 52% of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 15% of voters overall \u201csomewhat support\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination; 13% of conservatives, 13% of Republicans, 21% of moderates and 24% of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 8% overall \u201cstrongly support\u201d a different candidate\u2019s nomination; 5% of conservatives, 6% of Republicans, 15% of moderates and 15% of independents agree,\n\n\u2022 5% overall \u201csomewhat support\u201d a different candidate\u2019s nomination; 5% of conservatives, 4% of Republicans, 7% of moderates and 9% of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 3% overall don\u2019t know or have no opinion; 2% of conservatives, 3% of Republicans, 3% of moderates and 2% of independents agree.\n\nSource: A Politico/Morning Consult poll of 838 registered U.S. voters conducted Sept. 27-30.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
