China won't even say if there is one.", "language": "en", "text": "THE TICKER\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made a surprising admission: The deal with China that President Trump touted as the \"greatest and biggest\" actually needs work.\n\nThat's considered candor from a Trump ally who is practiced by now at toeing the president's line.\n\nMnuchin touted the phase-one deal Trump administration negotiators struck last week as \"quite substantial\" and \"a fundamental agreement in principle,\" in a CNBC interview. But he offered this decidedly un-Trumpian assessment: That the matter remains \u201csubject to documentation and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done on that front.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Trump has framed the fact the two sides didn\u2019t actually spell out and sign a document sealing the agreement as a mere detail. (See our rundown of the handshake agreement here.)\n\nBut Mnuchin\u2019s version of the state of play bears even less resemblance to the one offered by the Chinese. \u201cOne word has been suspiciously absent from China\u2019s media coverage of the trade talks with the United States over the past few days: deal,\u201d my colleague Anna Fifield writes from Beijing. \u201cThere has been a \u2018result,\u2019 there has been \u2018progress,\u2019 but there has been no \u2018deal.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOr as official Chinese mouthpiece Xinhua put it, \u201cThis outcome is in line with the expectations of all parties. It took a step in the direction of resolving China-U.S. economic and trade issues, serves the interests of the Chinese and American people and is generally welcomed by the international community.\u201d\n\nThe piece argued that \u201csolving the structural problems in bilateral economic and trade relations over the years cannot be achieved overnight.\u201d\n\nMnuchin insisted the two sides came to agreements on intellectual property protections, issues related to financial services, currency and foreign exchange, and structural concerns related to agriculture. But as Fifield notes, \u201cthe White House did not release a single fact sheet about any of those issues or how things would be changed.\u201d And Chinese officials indicated they need to engage in another round of negotiations before committing to any terms on paper.\n\nMeanwhile, Mnuchin renewed the threat of another round of tariffs, telling CNBC that 15 percent import duties on roughly $160 billion of Chinese goods will still hit on Dec. 15 barring an agreement. \"I have every expectation if there\u2019s not a deal those tariffs would go in place, but I expect we\u2019ll have a deal,\" he told CNBC.\n\nSee Mnuchin's appearance on CNBC here:\n\n\u201cPardon us if we are confused, but the events of the last few days have been confusing,\u201d High Frequency Economics Chief International Economist Carl Weinberg writes in a note, adding that \u201cred flags are flying all around this alleged deal \u2026 This \u2018deal\u2019 \u2014 if indeed there really is one \u2014 obviously addresses only a small part of the laundry list of complaints the Trump administration has with Beijing.\u201d\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson was harsher, calling the agreement a \u201ctwentieth of a deal \u2026 and even that is not yet certain.\u201d\n\nHe wrote off as \u201ctrivial\u201d the relief provided by the suspension of a tariff hike scheduled to hit this week. \u201cIt's possible that further negotiations over the next couple of months will change that, but for now the substance of this agreement is that China plans substantially to step up purchases of U.S. farm products, which it needed anyway, in return for the deferment of a tariff increase,\u201d he writes in a note. \u201cWe remain of the view that a comprehensive deal will not be struck until after the 2020 election, and the economy will suffer in the meantime.\u201d\n\nStocks fell as investors processed that the deal amounted to meaningfully less than the Trump administration\u2019s billing: The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq all shed 0.1 percent. The economic ripple effects of an underwhelming agreement could be worse: Morgan Stanley writes that employers who had been banking on a breakthrough may start laying off workers now that no such progress is evident:\n\nMORGAN STANLEY: Hopes for a trade deal may have been holding back layoffs. \u201cMany of our industry analysts have been telling us they expect 'restructuring' announcements to become more prevalent\u201d in Q4, as firms \u201cdecide to flush this year's results in hopes of saving next year's.\u201d pic.twitter.com/KVGUpRjL7T \u2014 Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) October 15, 2019\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

CNBC's Jeff Cox: \"Companies head into the third-quarter earnings reporting period with trouble behind, more hazards ahead and a muddied road map to guide the journey. As the season kicks into gear this week, S&P 500 firms are expected to report a 4.6% earnings decline over the same period a year ago, according to FactSet. If the period ends up with a negative number, that will make three quarters in a row, the first time that\u2019s happened in three years.\n\n\"Investors never seem to focus on what\u2019s in the rearview mirror as much as they do the outlook for what\u2019s on the horizon. In this case, though, they\u2019re likely to see the same thing: Profits weighed down by tariffs, economic weakness and geopolitical tumult that seems unlikely to go away anytime soon, despite the recent good news that the U.S. and China have reached at least the first phase of a trade agreement.\"\n\n\u2014 E.U., U.K. negotiators seek to reach agreement today. Bloomberg's Jonathan Stearns and Ian Wishart: \"British negotiators submitted a revised set of Brexit plans to Brussels amid growing optimism that a deal could be struck this week. The new proposals are aimed at clarifying the U.K.\u2019s proposed customs rules for Northern Ireland, two officials said. Talks will continue throughout the day in Brussels as the two sides try to agree on how far Northern Ireland will be detached from the EU\u2019s customs union -- something that risks incurring the opposition of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose support will be vital for any deal to pass.\"\n\nForeign Markets Are Caught in Dollar\u2019s Web The capital markets and global economy are caught in a feedback loop amplified by U.S. politics and the U.S. dollar.

The retaliatory measures followed Trump\u2019s decision to order the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Syria\u2019s northern border with Turkey, which has enabled Turkish forces to launch an offensive against the U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in Syria.\"\n\n\u2014 WTO clears U.S. to impose Airbus-related tariffs: The World Trade Organization formally authorized the U.S. \u201cto impose tariffs on up to $7.5 billion of imports of EU goods after an arbitrator\u2019s decision over subsidies to planemaker Airbus,\u201d Reuters's Stephanie Nebehay reports.\n\n\u201cThe authorization was a formality after a WTO arbitrator awarded a record right to retaliate over illegal subsidies this month. It would only have been denied if all WTO members present voted against. The meeting lasted less than 20 minutes.\u201d\n\nPOCKET CHANGE\n\nThe logo of Deutsche bank is seen in Hong Kong. (Reuters/Tyrone Siu)\n\n\u2014 Deutsche Bank spent big to win foothold in China. NYT's Michael Forsythe, David Enrich and Alexandra Stevenson: \"Millions of dollars were paid out to Chinese consultants, including a business partner of the premier\u2019s family and a firm that secured a meeting for the bank\u2019s chief executive with the president. And more than 100 relatives of the Communist Party\u2019s ruling elite were hired for jobs at the bank, even though it had deemed many unqualified.\n\n\"This was all part of Deutsche Bank\u2019s strategy to become a major player in China, beginning nearly two decades ago when it had virtually no presence there. And it worked. By 2011, the German company would be ranked by Bloomberg as the top bank for managing initial public offerings in China and elsewhere in Asia, outside Japan... [Confidential documents show] Deutsche Bank\u2019s troubling behavior in China was far more extensive than the authorities in the United States have publicly alleged. And they show that the bank\u2019s top leadership was warned about the activity but did not stop it.\"\n\n\u2014 Libra attempts to move past high-profle exits.

The members, including Uber, Lyft and Spotify, met in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday to sign onto the Libra Association charter, which will govern the libra cryptocurrency...\n\n\"The project hit a major snag on Friday, when Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, eBay and Mercado Pago all said they will no longer be part of the Libra project, following PayPal\u2019s decision to pull out earlier last week, and leaving PayU as the only remaining payments company on the council.\"\n\nAn ad for Boeing.

It will run out of money in the second quarter of next year if the company\u2019s current trajectory doesn\u2019t change, according to research by AllianceBernstein.

Uber dismissed more than 800 employees over two rounds of cuts in July and September. Since a disappointing initial public offering in May, Uber\u2019s stock price is down about 30%.
