Aaron Chown/Pool via REUTERS\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday urged President Donald Trump to reconsider a decision to let a U.S. diplomat\u2019s wife use diplomatic immunity after she was involved in a fatal car crash in England and then left the country.\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, was killed in August in a road collision near RAF Croughton, an air force base in central England that is used by the United States.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister urged the president to reconsider the U.S. position so the individual involved can return to the UK, cooperate with police and allow Harry\u2019s family to receive justice,\u201d a Downing Street spokeswoman said in a readout of a call between the two leaders.\n\nJohnson has said he hoped the diplomat\u2019s wife, Anne Sacoolas, would choose to return to Britain to engage with investigators.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, Trump told reporters: \u201cIt was a terrible accident. We\u2019re going to speak to her and we\u2019re going to see the person driving the car, the wife of the diplomat, we\u2019re going to speak to her and see what we can come up with so that there can be some healing.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Dunn\u2019s mother Charlotte Charles said after meeting with British foreign secretary Dominic Raab that no progress had been made over the last week.\n\n\u201cPart of me is feeling like it was just a publicity stunt on the UK government side to show they are trying to help,\u201d she said.\n\nRaab said he shared the frustration of Dunn\u2019s parents.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday urged President Donald Trump to reconsider a decision to let a U.S. diplomat's wife use diplomatic immunity after she was involved in a fatal car crash in England and then left the country.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438979243&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981XL", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
