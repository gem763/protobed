But on closer inspection it seems to be nothing more than a rehash of the group\u2019s previous exploits.\n\nAccording to research published yesterday, the hacking group, Lazarus, is now using fake cryptocurrency trading software, created by a similarly fake front company, Forbes reports.\n\nIt appears that hackers set up a front company called JMT Trading, and wrote an accompanying open-source cryptocurrency trading app. The code to which was hosted on GitHub. However, here\u2019s where the originality ends.\n\nIn the code for the JMT Trading software is a piece of malicious code which, according to Mac security expert Patrick Wardle, gives hackers the \u201cability to remotely execute commands\u201d on a victim\u2019s device. It gives bad actors full control over the infected macOS system, giving attackers the ability to do anything they want, he added.\n\nOn closer inspection, JMT Trading is just a reapplication of Lazarus\u2019 previous strategies in which it bundles nefarious code with legitimate looking apps.\n\nLast year, Lazarus set up a fake trading platform and company called Celas, it was detected by security researchers at Kaspersky Labs. Research posted to Securelist, Kaspersky\u2019s media outlet read:\n\nWhile investigating a cryptocurrency exchange attacked by Lazarus, we made an unexpected discovery. The victim had been infected with the help of a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which had been recommended to the company over email.\n\nYou could say that Lazarus has zero creativity, seeing as it\u2019s just recycling its old hacks, but on the other hand, it could be because its scams are working.\n\nResearch last year found the North korea-linked hacking group was the most profitable hacking syndicate in the world.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
