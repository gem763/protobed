He finished that half-inning but then decided he couldn\u2019t continue at his best, and Yan Gomes replaced him for the rest of the game.\n\nWhen manager Dave Martinez met with the media Saturday before Game 4, he said the results of the MRI hadn\u2019t come back yet. But he wants to know before the day is out what his catcher situation is.\n\n\u201cI want a definitive today. I mean, we have to,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIf we deem that he can\u2019t be ready for a couple days then we\u2019re gonna have to do something \u2026 Last night, I spoke to him. He doesn\u2019t feel as bad as he did yesterday, so that\u2019s a good sign. Till I actually hear from the doctor and Paul and see what the results were, I can\u2019t say at this point how long he\u2019s gonna be out.\u201d\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, Suzuki would be out a few days, and Raudy Read would be the most likely replacement for him on the 25-man roster.\n\nGomes will start behind the plate for Game 4 and bat eighth in the order. Gomes is the usual batterymate for starter Patrick Corbin, so he was likely going to play Saturday even if Suzuki wasn\u2019t hurt.\n\nBut Suzuki usually catches Max Scherzer, who will start Game 5.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked really well together,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cJust being in sync at what pitch to throw and even in big situations. But I\u2019ve also worked with Yan this year several times \u2026 We do have a good rapport with each other. We do understand what\u2019s going on, and Yan\u2019s very astute to the game of being able to watch what\u2019s gong on and how I see those guys and what we want to do.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
