Ilhan Omar (D-MN) on Friday filed for a divorce from her second husband and the father of her three kids, Ahmed Hirsi, TMZ reported. The announcement comes after months of speculation that Omar was having an affair with her campaign consultant, Tim Mynett. Omar admittedly denied the affair but Mynett's wife, Beth, ended up filing for divorce following the ordeal.\n\nMynett denied the allegations in his own court documents. He denied saying he was in love with Omar and was leaving his wife to pursue a relationship with the Congresswoman, the Associated Press reported.\n\nFrom TMZ:\n\nHer divorce adds another layer to her complicated history with her now estranged husband, Hirsi. They reportedly married in a religious ceremony in 2002 -- but the union was not recognized legally. The couple had 2 children together, but separated in 2008. She went on to marry another man named Ahmed -- British citizen Ahmed Elmi -- in Minneapolis in 2009, and this time it was official with legal docs and everything. However, they reportedly split in 2011 and he returned to the UK ... but they weren't legally divorced until 2017. Meanwhile, Omar reconciled with Hirsi in 2012 and they had another child together ... while she was still legally married to Elmi. Omar and Elmi divorced officially in 2017, and then she wed Hirsi -- legally this time -- in 2018.\n\nAccording to Omar, there's been an \"irretrievable breakdown of the marriage relationship.\" She wants joint legal and physical custody of the children and for the court to deny spousal support on both sides.\n\nA spokesperson for the freshman Congresswoman placed blame on \"political opponents and the media\" for the divorce.", "description": "Wow..10/07/2019 21:23:44PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/199/82ec5ce9-1c71-4318-a18f-d112e6cafbd2.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
