The cost is actually in the 'project management' rather than the materials themselves. If you are willing to do the project management yourself, you will save thousands,' she said.\n\nRichard completed many of the trade jobs himself, except the electrics and plumbing, by speaking to friends and watching YouTube videos, whereas Penina sourced a lot of the bargain items.\n\nShe used Facebook Marketplace, Gumtree and a secondhand shop in a 'ritzy suburb' to find materials. If it had to be bought new she searched for it on Google and 'sorted by price' in the description field to bring up the cheapest vendor.\n\nRichard completed many of the trade jobs himself, except the electrics and plumbing, by speaking to friends and watching YouTube videos, whereas Penina sourced a lot of the bargain items\n\nShe used Facebook Marketplace, Gumtree and a secondhand shop in a 'ritzy suburb' to find materials.

Save more money than you spend Our project took us a while because we funded it out of wages rather than ripping equity out of the home. This puts us in a good position now when coming to sell because all that money we invested, we'll get back tenfold. It isn't a bad thing sitting on a home while renovating. Your home is going up in value the whole time and this allows you to take breaks along the way. 2. Don't be in a hurry Unless you are an experienced renovator it is important to not do much in the first six months of a renovation. It takes time to get a feel for what a home needs. You need to live in that home for a while to understand what's good about the place and what's not. If you rush in and renovate, you may not discover the hidden gems. Nor will you understand why the previous owners did what they did. 3. Never pay full price We never paid full price for anything. We'd start with an item at full price and then try to find it elsewhere for at least half its value if not more. Again, patience is key. 4. Be prepared to inconvenience yourself If you have to drive 40 minutes with two of your hubby's mates in the car to pick up a $100 Caesarstone benchtop - do it. That Saturday trip will save you at least $2900 and is well worth the effort.\n\nThe kitchen cabinets and pantry combined was the most expensive part of the renovation at $1,804, with their new 900mm Technika oven costing slightly less at $1,639 including installation.\n\nRichard was able to install the cabinetry himself so they weren't charged labouring fees but he left the kitchen bench ($300) and sink ($10) installing to the professionals for $200.\n\n'Avoid square-cornered sinks on eBay. They are cheap but horrible to use as the food doesn't drain into the sink hole. Go for modern looking sinks with curved basins that drain water out well,' Penina said.\n\n'Avoid square-cornered sinks on eBay.

Since we are living in a renovation we needed to remove around 3,000 bricks from our backyard,' she said.\n\nPenina stressed that the hard work of searching for the right prices is ultimately worth the hassle, when the money you save can be used for a holiday\n\n'My husband discovered on Facebook Marketplace that our bricks were worth good money. They were worth at least $1 each. So he advertised the bricks on Facebook.\n\n'People came from all over Melbourne (and beyond) to collect them. There wasn't a day that went by, that I didn't see a new person in our backyard, each with wheelbarrows full of bricks.\n\n'We collected $2,500 for the bricks and used the money to pay for our black fridge. It was such a win-win and a great way to recycle.'\n\nPenina stressed that the hard work of searching for the right prices is ultimately worth the hassle, when the money you save can be used for a holiday.\n\nYou can follow Penina and Richard over at the Savings Room or on Instagram.", "description": "A thrifty Australian couple managed to completely renovate their kitchen - including replacing all of the appliances - for $5,000.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/20/06/18703230-0-image-a-55_1568957233423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
