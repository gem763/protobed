Climate Action Summit | Spencer Platt/Getty Images Trump mocks Greta Thunberg \u2018You are failing us,\u2019 teen climate activist said to assembled leaders Monday.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump mocked 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg on Twitter late Monday.\n\nPosting a fatalistic statement the Swedish teen had made earlier Monday at the United Nations\u2019 special meeting on climate change, Trump tweeted: \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201c\n\nTrump briefly attended the Climate Action Summit in New York but left after 14 minutes. The president has consistently expressed skepticism about the notion of man-made climate change, and his administration has declined to make the issue any sort of priority.\n\nThunberg has developed an international following for her persistent efforts to get the international community to combat climate change, particularly winning support among young people. Trump\u2019s tweet contained one of her quotes from her U.N. remarks Monday: \"People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth.\u201d\n\nThunberg did not mention Trump or any other leaders by name in her remarks, but she did scold the world\u2019s leaders.\n\n\"You are failing us,\u201d she said to the assembled leaders. \u201cBut the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say: We will never forgive you.\"\n\nLast Wednesday, Thunberg addressed a congressional committee in Washington. \u201cI want you to listen to the scientists,\" she said. \"And I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take real action.\"\n\nTrump was not alone Monday in mocking Thunberg. On Fox News, Michael Knowles referred to Thunberg as \u201ca mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left,\" then doubled down and called her \u201cmentally ill\u201d a second time. The network subsequently apologized for his remarks.", "description": "\u2018You are failing us,\u2019 teen climate activist said to assembled leaders Monday.", "authors": ["David Cohen", "Arren Kimbel-Sannit", "Emma Anderson", "Kalina Oroschakoff"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1176619366-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
