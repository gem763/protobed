No more stress for your pet,' Ford explained.\n\n'A concept for now, but with the potential to mean a much better start to the year, both for your dog \u2013 and for you.'\n\nA recent study by the University of Bern in Switzerland found that some 50 percent of dogs show signs of fear with fireworks, such as panting and getting anxious or nervous\n\nHOW DOES ACTIVE NOISE CONTROL SOUND-CANCELLING TECHNOLOGY WORK? Active noise control is found in high-end noise cancelling headphones and promises to reduce the amount of ambient sound entering a wearer's ears. Each headphone speaker is equipped with a microphone, which enables the system to detect the waveforms of sounds entering them. It then generates an exact match for these sound waves, which is then inverted. When these two opposite signals meet, it cancels out the offending outside sounds. Some systems claim to be capable of reducing noise by up to 90 per cent, although this may be as low as 50 per cent in some models. The technology has existed for several decades, but has relatively recently been used in commercial headphones. Even more recently, it has begun to be applied in industrial and other public situations. Full size speakers equipped with the technology is used to cancel out the disruptive noises of transformers, compressors and other low frequency machinery. A number of institutions are also working on ways to incorporate it into residential and commercial buildings, like homes, shops and offices.\n\nIn a video, the company showed what the structure is made out of, including noise-cancellation panels and the active noise control, which looks similar to speakers.\n\nThere's also an automatic glass door, 'anti-vibration block risers' and sound-proof ventilation.\n\nIt turns out noise sensitivity is a big problem for many dogs.\n\nA recent study by the University of Bern in Switzerland found that some 50 percent of dogs show signs of fear with fireworks, such as panting and getting anxious or nervous.\n\n'We wondered how the technologies we use in our cars could help people in other situations,' Lyn West, marketing communications at Ford of Europe, said in a statement.\n\nIn a video, the company showed what the structure is made out of, including noise-cancellation panels and the active noise control, which looks similar to speakers\n\nThe company's active noise control technology works by fighting noise with noise.
