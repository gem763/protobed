He then sprinted half the length of the field to claim his third and South Africa scored again when Warrick Gelant weaved his way through the Canucks defence.\n\nCanada\u2019s night got even worse when Larsen was sent off before the break following a foul-play review by the TMO and they were breached again when Frans Steyn crashed over from close range.\n\nThe Springboks made a slow start to the second half and Canada registered a consolation when Jeff Hassler drove to the line and Matt Heaton forced his way over.\n\nNormal service was soon resumed, however, as the veteran hooker Schalk Brits claimed a well-worked try and Damian Willemse \u2013 only recently drafted into the squad as an injury replacement \u2013 went over from a scrum.\n\nFrans Malherbe powered through the defence for South Africa\u2019s 10th try eight minutes from time.", "description": "South Africa secured their place in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals with a 66-7 victory against 14-man Canada in Kobe", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b343f5e57cb3349891e171e542842e454b360c4b/69_110_2205_1322/master/2205.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c0f9631d88a4988d06b2db7e3e2dcd3b", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
