They had since been held in the notorious Evin prison north of Tehran.\n\nFollowing \"very sensitive negotiations\" with Tehran, the couple has been released, Payne said on Saturday.\n\n\"They are being returned to Australia and they will be reunited with their family,\" she told reporters in Sydney.\n\n\"For Jolie and for Mark, the ordeal they have been through is now over,\" she added. \"They are in good spirits and they are in good health.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Iran's state media reported that an Iranian student that was detained in Australia for 13 months on accusations of circumventing US sanctions on military equipment has returned to Tehran after being released.\n\nReza Dehbashi, a PhD student at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, had been arrested for \"attempting to purchase and transfer advanced American military radar equipment via Dubai to Iran\", the state TV's website said.\n\n'Spying for another country'\n\nNegotiations over the fate of Melbourne University Academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a third Australian accused of \"spying for another country\", were ongoing, Australia's Foreign Minister Payne said.\n\nUniversity lecturer Moore-Gilbert, who specialises in Middle East politics with a focus on Gulf states, had been held for \"some months\" before King and Firkin in an unrelated case.\n\n\"She has been detained for some considerable time and has faced the Iranian legal system and has been convicted and sentenced,\" Payne said.\n\n\"We are continuing our discussions with the Iranian government,\" the foreign minister added. \"We don't accept the charges on which she was convicted and we would seek to have her returned to Australia.\"\n\nLast year, Moore-Gilbert was sentenced to 10 years in jail for spying.\n\nNews of the arrests last month came after Canberra announced it would contribute a frigate and surveillance aircraft to a US-led mission to protect shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, with tensions high in the Gulf region.\n\nPayne has maintained the cases of those being held were not related to diplomatic tensions.", "description": "Jolie King and Mark Firkin were accused by the Iranian government of using a drone to take pictures of military sites.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/5/739189fef2de43abb88c00947fe5a3bd_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
