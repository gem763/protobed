That\u2019s how I felt watching Rihanna\u2019s Savage x Fenty lingerie show on Tuesday night at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. It was an awakening. A revelation. My palate has been so thoroughly cleansed, I forget how deprived I was before. Now, there is only pre-Fenty and post-Fenty. I\u2019m fairly certain that I\u2019m not exaggerating.\n\nSavage x Fenty made its New York Fashion Week debut last September after launching in the spring of 2018. It was so exciting, one pregnant model went into labor immediately afterwards. Viewers at home could stream it online, but this season\u2019s megaproduction will reach a significantly larger audience \u2014 around 200 million \u2014 with the help of Amazon Prime Video, which will reveal last night\u2019s footage to members on September 20.\n\nBezos and Bad Gal may seem like unlikely bedfellows, but Rihanna\u2019s goal was to reach as many people as possible this season. (That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a sucker for Prime like the rest of us. She told press that the last thing she purchased on Amazon was Darth Vader cufflinks for a certain someone.) With such a huge backer, she was also able to fund a Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2013level spectacle, complete with musical acts, supermodels, and a massive stage set.\n\n\u201cLast year, we laid the foundation for what the brand stood for,\u201d Rihanna told the Cut at about 1:30 a.m., when she had finally wrapped. \u201cHere\u2019s our bottom line: We\u2019re inclusive. We want women to feel confident no matter what size they\u2019re in. This year, it was about: How do we expand that? How do we make more women feel more confident?\u201d\n\nPhoto: Rihanna\u2019s Savage X Fenty Show Presented by Amazon Prime Video.\n\nIn order to ensure that last night\u2019s footage remains secret until two weeks from now, everyone in the audience \u2014 including Anna Wintour, Edward Enninful, Kacey Musgraves, Diplo, and a number of Victoria\u2019s Secret models \u2014 had to surrender their phones, which were then sealed in a bag and locked for the duration of the 30-minute performance. (I was told that Luka Sabbat, among others, did not abide by these rules, but spoilers have been kept to a minimum.) I don\u2019t need my phone to remember what I saw, though, because it will be seared into my brain until I inevitably watch it again. (And again.) Victoria\u2019s Secret, who?\n\nWhen asked if Rihanna was coming for the brand\u2019s turf, comedian Phoebe Robinson replied: \u201cOf course! They better watch out.\u201d\n\nPerformer A$AP Ferg agreed. \u201cShe\u2019s giving us a whole damn Super Bowl performance,\u201d he said before the show.\n\nPhoto: Rihanna\u2019s Savage X Fenty Show Presented by Amazon Prime Video.\n\nAround 9:30 p.m., the lights went up, and there she was: Rihanna! Standing with her hands on her hips underneath a spotlight, wearing a mesh, long-sleeve bodysuit and a velvet mini skirt. She stood on a platform above a shallow pool of water surrounded by women of different body types and skin tones, each also wearing a sleek black leotard. Later, she told press that she wanted the opening image to be all about silhouette.\n\nDramatic music blasted over the speakers and Rihanna started dancing, isolating her muscles like the hottest mime you\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s been a long time since Rihanna went on tour, and some of us may have forgetten that she has moves. What\u2019s more shocking: She only had two and a half hours to rehearse after deciding at the last minute that she wanted to open the show. But Rihanna is a performer, first and foremost. And she\u2019s still got it.\n\nNext, Gigi Hadid appeared in a black lace corset, plus a matching thong garter and lace cap. The drama! This was not the all-American \u201cangel\u201d we\u2019ve seen on the Victoria\u2019s Secret runway. She didn\u2019t owe anyone a smile.\n\nBig Sean was the first to perform, followed by A$AP Ferg, Migos, Halsey, DJ Khaled, Fat Joe, Tierra Whack, and Fabolous. Alas, Rihanna did not introduce any new music, but let\u2019s not get too greedy. Still, I was surprised she chose so many male performers. Victoria\u2019s Secret often does the same, but it didn\u2019t feel as icky this time; there was less ogling. It was clear that the performers were there to keep the crowd hyped, rather than for the reaction shots. The only singer who interacted intimately with models was Halsey, who herself has a history with VS.\n\nPhoto: Rihanna\u2019s Savage X Fenty Show Presented by Amazon Prime Video.\n\nCara Delevingne lead an all-green lingerie portion, taking the stage with a bedazzled whip which she used to hypnotize a row of models. \u201cOops (Oh My)\u201d by Tweet featuring Missy Elliott played as the dancers spread their legs and gestured as though they were touching themselves. They got on their hand and knees. They grabbed the butt cheeks of the person in front of them. Clearly, they were enjoying themselves \u2014 and the company of their peers. I could never imagine myself wearing angel wings, but seeing how into it they were, I felt like I could relate to them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a wonderful feeling backstage; everyone is lifting each other up,\u201d Delevingne, a former Victoria\u2019s Secret model herself, told press beforehand. \u201cThere\u2019s so much love involved. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this, honestly.\u201d\n\n21 Savage took the stage arm in arm with Joan Smalls, who wore a red lace corset. Laverne Cox strutted out in a neon pink leotard, closing her routine with a leg kick so high it bowled me over from the back of the auditorium.\n\nThere was a Cellblock Tango number, with performers winding and grinding in individual windows. Flesh bounced freely. Skinny models were followed by curvy models, who were followed by paraplegic models. \u201cShake That Thing,\u201d by Sean Paul played as Normani almost (almost!) outdid her \u201cMotivation\u201d routine in nothing but a bra and panties. There was a BDSM portion. Alek Wek, Aquaria, Bella Hadid, and Paloma Elsesser also made appearances.\n\nThe show\u2019s choreography, which was done by Parris Goebel (of Justin Bieber \u201cSorry\u201d fame), was far and away the highlight. There was a strength to it that gave the show seriousness. The dancers were in full control of their bodies, and it was that energy that gave them sex appeal. No matter how hard Victoria\u2019s Secret tries in the future, it will be hard to unsee what\u2019s been missing from their stage for so long.\n\n\u201cParris is a badass bitch,\u201d Rihanna told the Cut afterward. \u201cI love how she makes everything sexy, despite society\u2019s ideal of what sexy looks like. She makes me feel like the shit. I don\u2019t care about any skinny Victoria\u2019s Secret model when I look at Parris. I want to be that woman on the inside. I want to feel that bombastic. She gives me so much hope.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the night, I heard someone express the exact sentiment that Rihanna and her team were trying to provoke. From somewhere behind me came the cry: \u201cI LOVE THESE WOMEN!\u201d", "description": "Rihanna clearly wants her Fenty line to be the new Victoria\u2019s Secret, and she made her intentions clear with an inclusive, uplifting, celebrity-packed Amazon-streaming runway show.
