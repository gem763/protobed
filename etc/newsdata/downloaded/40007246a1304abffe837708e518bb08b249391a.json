your transport emissions\n\nWith 535 000km of road and 21 000km of rail, South Africa needs to address the issue of greenhouse gases produced by the transport industry and its impact on climate change.\n\nEmissions from the sector account for 10.8% of the country\u2019s total greenhouse gases emissions but in addition to these direct emissions, arising from the combustion of fuels, there are indirect emissions from the production, refining and transportation of fuels.\n\nSustainable development, applied to transport systems, requires the promotion of linkages between environmental protection, economic efficiency and social progress.\n\nTransport systems form the backbone of South Africa\u2019s socioeconomic activities, through enabling the connection of people with each other, services and facilities and, together with the transportation of goods are fundamental to the economy of South Africa.\n\nHowever, this must be done in a sustainable manner, hence the institution of the South African National Energy Development Institute\u2019s cleaner mobility programme, in conjunction with the department of transport.\n\nThe programme strives to implement \u201ccleaner mobility solutions\u201d, focussed mainly in cities and other niche markets and investigates and demonstrates alternative ways of mobility that will lead to the improvement of the environmental, social and economic conditions.\n\nSolutions that are clean in terms of exhaust emissions, efficient in terms of energy consumption and fit for purpose in terms of mobility objective are being designed and developed across the world.\n\nThe public transport system is the primary mode of transport in South Africa and plays an essential part in the daily life of the general South African population, with 40% of South Africans making use of public transport to commute.\n\nOverall, 67% of those who use public transport are on minibus taxis.\n\nElectric vehicles usage increases slowly\n\nAbout 1 000 electric vehicles have been sold in South Africa to date.\n\nHowever, the uptake of electric vehicles is much slower than in other parts of the globe.\n\nIn 2018, around 1.6 million electric vehicles were sold in the US, Europe and China collectively.\n\nChina is the world\u2019s leader in electric vehicles, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nThe China Association of Automotive Manufacturers stated in April 2019 that its sales of battery electric vehicles had risen 83% on a year-on-year basis.\n\nSales of plug-in hybrid vehicles had risen 91% over the same period.\n\n\n\nResearch firm TrendForce predicts in the Global Automotive Market Decode for Q1 report that electric vehicle shipments will reach 5.15 million in 2019, representing year-on-year growth of 28%.\n\nProposed solutions\n\nThe South African National Energy Development Institute has proposed several solutions to achieve cleaner mobility.\n\nOne of these is the natural gas project, which has begun to take a foothold in the South African market in both the minibus taxi industry and in the cities\u2019 metro bus systems.\n\nWhile not as greenhouse gases friendly as renewable energies or pure biogas, natural gas produces less emissions than the current fossil fuels being used in the country.\n\nAs such, it could serve as a potential transition fuel to stimulate biogas production by developing a potential off-take market.\n\nWhile rail and bus networks serve as a trunk service in parallel with minibus taxis, minibus taxis are a key feeder into these services \u2013 transporting passengers their first and last kilometre.\n\nThis service is critical, given the context of South Africa\u2019s low population densities, long travel distances as well as modal and structural inefficiencies.\n\nThis first and last kilometre service provides commuters with greater access and convenience.\n\nThe department of transport\u2019s national land transport strategic framework includes a move to a corridor and node approach, which will continue to create demand for integrated feeder services.\n\nAn encouragement to use non-motorised transport is also under way.\n\nInstituting \u201cno-car zones\u201d, with most of the central business districts being closed off for car use, would emphasise eco-mobility modes of transport such as walking and cycling, as the preferred mode of transport.\n\nThis extensive network of cycle lanes and pedestrian walkways would reorient South Africa\u2019s towns and cities away from cars towards people.\n\nThe investment in non-motorised transport infrastructure will yield a double dividend in terms of human health, by both reducing harmful air pollution and promoting healthy exercise.\n\nThe replacement of fossil fuels by vehicle technologies with low or zero tailpipe emissions, such as electric and fuel cell vehicles would lead to a reduction in the carbon intensity of motorised transport.\n\nThe uptake in electric vehicles in South Africa has improved and electrical charging stations are being installed on long distance routes, as well as urban points.\n\nAs it is Transport Month, we encourage all South Africans to consider ways in which they can reduce their transport emissions and help in the combating of climate change.\n\nwww.sanedi.org.za\n\n\u2022 Barry Bredenkamp is general manager for
