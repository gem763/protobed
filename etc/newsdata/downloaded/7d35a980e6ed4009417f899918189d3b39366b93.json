If a dish isn\u2019t quite right, a bigger pinch of salt or a splash of wine will make each testing taste better than the last, until it reaches perfect-for-dinner status.\n\nBakers, on the other hand, are married to a recipe, flanked by measuring cups and scales, thermometers, protective gloves and rules. SO. MANY. RULES. It\u2019s the rules that can intimidate would-be bakers to cling tightly to their status as \u201ccooks.\u201d I get it.\n\nVoraciously\u2019s Baking Basics newsletter is here to break down the most important rules of baking, because the rules are the keys to success. In this eight-week series, I\u2019m going to help you become a better, more confident baker.\n\nBaking is a transformation. When we braise, say, short ribs, we\u2019re asking our ingredients to mingle and emerge from the oven as \u2026 short ribs.\n\n\n\n(Photo by Trevor Ekanger)\n\nWhen we place a mixture of butter, sugar, eggs and flour in the oven, we\u2019re asking those ingredients to transform into cake. And not just any cake, but the grand finale to a dinner gathering or the centerpiece of granddaddy\u2019s 99th birthday party \u2014 no big deal.\n\nThat kind of transformative magic requires a few rules, yes. That kind of magic also calls for attention, patience, skill and hope. It\u2019s a practice and a meditation and \u2014 here\u2019s the most important thing to remember \u2014 there\u2019s cake at the end!\n\n<SIGN UP FOR VORACIOUSLY\u2019S BAKING BASICS HERE>\n\nI\u2019m Joy Wilson, better known as Joy the Baker.
