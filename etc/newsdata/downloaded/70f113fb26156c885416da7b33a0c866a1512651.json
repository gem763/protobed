(iStock)\n\nThey say the doctor had already been warned.\n\nOfficials suspect Florida doctor Francesann Ford injected her plastic surgery patients with fake Botox from China even after the Food and Drug Administration told her to stop, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported. Authorities raided Ford\u2019s Coral Springs office earlier this week as part of a year-long investigation into her practices, local news reports say.\n\n\u201cObviously, these chemical components being brought in from China are not vetted, sanctioned, or approved in any way,\u201d U.S. Postal Service Inspector Ivan Ramirez said, according to the Sun Sentinel.\n\nFord is accused of using non-FDA-approved drugs on people who found her services through Groupon, an e-commerce site better known for its discounts on dinners out or yoga classes. Ramirez cautioned people against falling for \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d offers on the site, where a growing array of medical services serve as a testament to \u201ca health care market where patients desperately want a deal,\u201d as a recent Kaiser Health News article put it.\n\nFord has so far not been charged in the case, officials said.\n\nGroupon is no longer working with Ford\u2019s business and reached out to customers after the allegations were brought to its attention, company spokesman Bill Roberts told The Washington Post. With almost 6,000 medical-related promotions available around the United States, the site offers top providers and is \u201cincreasingly becoming a destination for people concerned about their health-care dollars,\u201d he said.\n\nFlorida plastic surgeon Adam Rubinstein told The Post that, while Groupon offers of health services are not necessarily problematic, the allegations against Ford feed long-standing concerns about deal-seeking patients\u2019 vulnerability to scams and doctors without certification in his field. Stories abound of patients suffering from reduced-rate injections of toxic materials and fatal complications that could have been avoided.\n\n[Fake Florida doctor who \u2018enhanced\u2019 buttocks with cement, caulking gets 10 years for manslaughter]\n\nPlastic surgery \u201cis costly to do the right way, and so there\u2019s too much temptation for nefarious practitioners to get cheap material [and] offer the services at a cut rate,\u201d Rubinstein told The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s very tempting for the public.\u201d\n\nThe Post was unable to reach Ford or her business, Beautiful Vision, on Friday.\n\nBeautiful Vision\u2019s website describes Ford as \u201ca highly qualified physician with 9 years of experience in the field of surgery and ophthalmology.\u201d It states that she completed residency training in ophthalmology as well as fellowships in corneal research and oculoplastic surgery \u2014 plastic and reconstructive surgery of facial features such as the eyelids and cheeks.\n\nBut Ford does not have a plastic surgery certification through the American Board of Medical Specialties, according to the group\u2019s website Certification Matters. That means she lacks the specialty\u2019s standard stamp of approval, Rubinstein said.\n\nA licensed doctor can legally provide medical care of any kind to a consenting patient, he said, even if they lack the relevant board certification. He thinks that\u2019s a particular worry in the plastic surgery field, which he said many practitioners from other areas look to as a way to supplement their income.\n\nThe core of the allegations \u2014 that Ford used unapproved products despite a warning \u2014 would be \u201can egregious violation of ethics\u201d if true, Rubinstein added.\n\n[Plastic surgery is surging in America \u2014 the trends in six simple charts]\n\nAuthorities are looking to talk with patients who may have experienced complications from their cosmetic procedures at Beautiful Vision, news outlets reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the difference between just getting slapped with a sanction versus actually facing criminal charges,\u201d Ramirez said.\n\nMuch about the case against Ford is unclear, as the doctor has yet to be charged. The Florida Department of Health, reportedly involved in the investigation, could not speak to the case or even confirm its existence, spokesman Brad Dalton told The Post, citing a state law that says such details could only be shared after officials find \u201cprobable cause\u201d of wrongdoing.\n\n[Controversial apps for kids make cosmetic surgery into a game]\n\nState health, FDA and Postal Service officials executed Wednesday\u2019s search warrant at Ford\u2019s office, according to CBS Miami.\n\nFDA spokesman Jeremy Kahn told The Post he could only confirm that the agency\u2019s Office of Criminal Investigation is \u201cconducting a law enforcement activity\u201d in Coral Springs. Kahn said he could not provide information about the FDA\u2019s reported prior warning to Ford or speak to when authorities would give a warning rather than take more punitive measures.\n\nThe Postal Service did not respond to inquiries Friday.\n\nRead more:\n\nA doctor who rapped and danced during plastic surgeries was negligent, lawsuits say\n\nA teen fractured her thumb.
