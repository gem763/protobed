The Competition and Markets Authority has suggested an operational split between companies\u2019 audit and nonaudit businesses, while a parliamentary committee called for a structural separation.\n\nThe FRC during the year ended March 31 increased the number of investigations against the country\u2019s audit firms, and handed out more and higher fines than in previous years.\n\nAs part of the changes in the sector, the FRC will become part of a new regulatory body called the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at nina.trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "The U.K. Financial Reporting Council tightened a key accounting standard used to assess a company\u2019s health following a string of corporate collapses in Britain.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-112279/social", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
