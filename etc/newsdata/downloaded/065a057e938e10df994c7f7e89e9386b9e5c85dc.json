These plates display famous scenery, attractions, or important cultural artifacts from localities around the country and offer an exciting alternative to the standard picture-less design of regular Japanese license plates. Seriously, who wouldn\u2019t say yes to a plate featuring the lovable Kumamon when given the choice?\n\nThis time, the ministry has released designs for a second round of local specialty plates with plans to begin issuing them in May 2020. Seventeen new editions will join the ranks of the first 41 and will be offered in the following areas throughout the country.\n\nHere\u2019s the new lineup with details (left to right, top to bottom).\n\nShiretoko \u2014 Shiretoko\u2019s magnificent natural scenery\n\nTomakomai \u2014 Lake Utonai and the city of ice hockey\n\nHirosaki \u2014 Hirosaki Castle, the cherry blossom-covered moat, and Mount Iwaki\n\nShirakawa \u2014 Komine Castle in the spring\n\nMatsudo \u2014 The scenery of Matsudo\n\nIchikawa \u2014 Ichikawa\u2019s pears, the city, and the Edo River\n\n\u25bc Kanto (5) and Hokuriky/Shinetsu (1) region plates\n\nFunabashi \u2014 Pears and Anderson Park\n\nIchihara \u2014 Rapeseed blossoms, cherry blossoms, and the Satoyama Torocco train\n\nKoto \u2014 Tokyo Gate Bridge\n\nKatsushika \u2014 Sweet flag (plant), the river, and kingfishers\n\nItabashi \u2014 Lively and colorful trees, flowers, and birds\n\nJoetsu \u2014 Uesugi Kenshin and cherry blossoms\n\n\u25bc Chubu (2), Kinki (1), Chugoku (1), and Shikoku (1) region plates\n\nIse-Shima \u2014 Charm flowing forth\n\nYokkaichi \u2014 Shining Yokkaichi City\n\nAsuka \u2014 Vermilion Bird (one of four mythological spirit creatures of constellations)\n\nIzumo \u2014 Yamata no Orochi (eight-headed serpent)\n\nTakamatsu \u2014 Gazing at Yashima from Takamatsu Port\n\nAny of the above regional license plate designs can be requested by locals in grayscale for no extra charge.
