And as we near the end of the decade, have things panned out the way you wanted them to?\n\nFor some footballers, success seems to have come naturally.\n\nYoung players can often be tipped for the top from a very early age, and they ultimately get there through hard work and often a little bit of luck.\n\nFor others though, it ends up being a different story.\n\nBack in 2010, Spanish publication Don Balon told the world the stories of who they saw as the 100 best young footballers - players who were 21 or under on January 1, 2010 - on the planet.\n\n(Image: Action Images / Photo News)\n\nAs we near the end of 2019, here's how they've got on.\n\nDominic Adiyiah (Reggina)\n\nThe Ghanaian forward was on the first of four loan spells away from AC Milan in 2010, but he'd never play for the San Siro giants.\n\nHe's spent the past four years in Thailand, now at Sisaket.\n\nToby Alderweireld (Ajax)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nLike many before and after him, the Belgian ended up leaving Ajax behind in 2013.\n\nHe first joined Atletico Madrid for a couple of years and is now established one of the Premier League top centre-backs at Tottenham .\n\nHamdan Al-Kamali (Al Wahda)\n\nThe Emirati is still at Al Wahda 10 years on, and has 52 caps for the UAE.\n\nJano Ananidze (Spartak Moscow)\n\nThe 42-times Georgia international attacking midfielder is still at Spartak, although he did join Rostov on loan on 2013/14 and Krylia Sovetov Samara last season.\n\nAndre Ayew (Marseille)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nNow in his second spell at Swansea City, via West Ham , the Ghana captain was the BBC\u2019s African Footballer of the Year in 2011.\n\nKhouma Babacar (Fiorentina)\n\nThe Senegalese forward spent several years with Fiorentina although most of those were out on loan.\n\nHe joined Sassuolo in 2018 and they've loaned him out again, this time to Lecce.\n\nHolger Badstuber (Bayern)\n\nSeen as the future of Bayern and Germany back in 2010, injuries severely hampered the centre-back's career with the perennial Bundesliga champions, although he is now a regular at Stuttgart.\n\nGareth Bale (Tottenham)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe Welshman left Spurs for Real Madrid for a then world record fee in 2013, and he\u2019s still there. Just about.\n\nMario Balotelli ( Manchester City )\n\nPlayed his part in City\u2019s 2011/12 title success, the Italian then embarked on a career in which off-field antics have been more well-chronicled than on-field performances.\n\nNow back in Italy at Brescia, via AC Milan, Liverpool , Nice and Marseille.\n\nBen Sahar (Hapoel Tel Aviv)\n\nAfter Chelsea (and loans at QPR, Sheffield Wednesday and Portsmouth) didn't work out for the Israeli, things went better for him back home.\n\nSpells in France, Germany and Holland followed, and the 43-times capped forward has now been at Hapoel Be'er Sheva since 2015.\n\nBojan (FC Barcelona)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOnce considered a contemporary of Lionel Messi, the nimble attacker ended up at Stoke via Roma, Milan and Ajax.\n\nAfter a couple more loans he's now in Canada with Montral Impact.\n\nKim Bo-Kyung (Oita Trinita)\n\nThe 37-times capped South Korean had three years at Cardiff and a brief spell at Wigan, but is now back home with Ulsan Hyundai.\n\nRyad Boudebouz (Sochaux)\n\nA regular in mid-table Ligue 1 sides and therefore the transfer gossip columns, the Algerian winger moved back to France this summer with Saint-Etienne after spells with Real Betis and Celta Vigo.\n\nDedryck Boyata (Manchester City)\n\n(Image: Action Images)\n\nThe Belgian was looking to follow in Vincent Kompany\u2019s footsteps at City, but never quite convinced.\n\nFared better over four years at Celtic though, and now at Hertha Berlin.\n\nBreno (Bayern)\n\nAfter playing 33 times for Bayern, the Brazilian defender - who had suffered serious injury problems and as a result psychological issues, including depression - was arrested for arson following a fire at his villa.\n\nHe was sentenced to 45 months in prison in July 2012, but ultimately served just 13 after getting his sentence reduced when it was proved that he was under the influence of dangerous medication.\n\nHe's now back in Brazil with Vasco da Gama.\n\nSergio Canales (Real Madrid)\n\nBilled as Real Madrid's bright new hope when he joined in 2010, the midfielder has ended up at Valencia, Real Sociedad and now Real Betis, picking up his first two Spain caps this year.\n\nMehdi Carcela-Gonzalez (Standard Liege)\n\nThe Moroccan midfielder had a brief spell at Russian upstarts Anzhi Makhachkala, went back to Standard Liege, moved onto Benfica, Granada and Olympiakos, and now he's back at Standard for a third time.\n\nLuc Castaignos (Feyenoord)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nGoals at Dutch youth level and on his breakthrough at Feyenoord led to the forward joining Inter Milan, but after flopping there he headed off around Europe and is now in South Korea with Gyeongnam.\n\nDiego Contento (Bayern)\n\nSpent four years on the fringes at Bayern before more regular football in four more at Bordeaux, but injury has severely restricted him since joining Fortuna Dusseldorf in 2018.\n\nPhillippe Coutinho (Internazionale)\n\nLeft Inter for Liverpool in early 2013, and shone at Anfield as part of attacking, entertaining sides so much that he got his dream move to Barcelona in 2018, but now at Bayern Munich on loan.\n\nDavid De Gea (Atletico Madrid)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThere were initial question marks over the Spaniard when he joined Manchester United from Atletico Madrid in 2011, but he\u2019s proven to be a brilliant addition.\n\nAlvaro Dom\u00ednguez (Atletico Madrid)\n\nA member of the Atletico squad that won the Europa League in 2010 and 2012, the midfielder also won two Spain caps in the latter year as well as joining Borussia Moenchengladbach.\n\nSadly he picked up chronic back problems in Germany and was forced to retire in 2016 at the age of 27.\n\nGiovanni dos Santos (Tottenham)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nTipped for the top at Barcelona, it was thought that Spurs had snapped up a gem when they brought in Dos Santos, but he ended up on loan at Ipswich.\n\nA few moves later he found a home at LA Galaxy, but this year left them for Mexican side America.\n\nDouglas Costa (Shakhtar)\n\nLike so many Brazilians before him, Douglas Costa's first move into Europe was with Shakhtar Donetsk, where he spent five years and honed his skills in order to allow him to progress at the highest level.\n\nThat has come with Bayern Munich and now Juventus , while he's been a league champion in each of the last four seasons.\n\nAlan Dzagoev (CSKA Moscow)\n\nStill at CSKA Moscow and one of the stars of Russian football, the attacking midfielder impressed at Euro 2012 but was injury-hit at the World Cup last summer.\n\nGueida Fofana (Le Havre)\n\n(Image: Bongarts/Getty Images for DFB)\n\nThe defensive midfielder joined Lyon in 2011 and started out impressively, but persistent ankle injuries ended his career in 2017.\n\nPaulo Henrique Ganso (Santos)\n\nThe eight-times capped Brazilian midfielder developed at Sao Paulo before moving onto Sevilla in 2016, but it never quite happened for him there and now he's back in Brazil with Fluminense.\n\nGiuliano (Internacional)\n\nGot his move to Europe with Dnipro in 2011, and has since played for Gremio, Zenit, Fenerbahce and now Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia, while quietly amassing 10 Brazil caps.\n\nMaxime Gonalons (Lyon)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWas a mainstay at Lyon for eight seasons before joining Roma in 2017, and he's now on loan at Granada via Sevilla.\n\nMario G\u00f6tze (Dortmund)\n\nBack at Dortmund after a spell at Bayern, Gotze will always have the 2014 World Cup final winning goal to his name even if his club career hasn\u2019t quite kicked on.\n\nAntoine Griezmann (Real Sociedad)\n\nShone at Atletico Madrid and became a mainstay of the France team.\n\nNow a World Cup winner and a Barcelona forward.\n\nEden Hazard (Lille)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDeveloped his reputation to become one of the very best in the Premier League over seven seasons at Chelsea , before making a long-expected move to Real Madrid this summer.\n\nJordan Henderson (Sunderland)\n\nEyebrows were raised when Liverpool paid near \u00a320million for the young midfielder in 2011, but eight years later he\u2019s a Champions League winning captain.\n\nMarkus Henriksen (Rosenborg)\n\nThe 50-times capped Norway international is into his fourth season at Hull City after joining from AZ Alkmaar, although he's currently out of the team having previously been captain.\n\nAbel Hern\u00e1ndez (Palermo)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSpeaking of Hull City, the Uruguayan forward was there for four years before joining CSKA Moscow last year, and now Al Ahli.\n\nAnder Herrera (Zaragoza)\n\nRose to prominence under Marcelo Bielsa at Athletic Bilbao, and impressed Manchester United so much that they ended up signing him.\n\nLeft for PSG in the summer.\n\nLewis Holtby (Mainz)\n\nBorn in Germany to an English father, there was once much excitement about the midfielder possibly choosing to represent the Three Lions, but he ended up with three caps for Germany.\n\nHe did move to England though, joining Tottenham from Schalke after his loan at Mainz, while he also had loans at Fulham and Hamburg, who he later joined permanently.\n\nHaving been without a club this summer, Holtby joined Championship side Blackburn Rovers last month.\n\nJames Rodriguez (Porto)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAfter a year at Monaco, the Colombian shot to world prominence with brilliant displays at the 2014 World Cup, which earned him a move to Real Madrid.\n\nIt\u2019s been up and down for him there, but now he\u2019s back after two years on loan at Bayern Munich.\n\nStefan Jovetic (Fiorentina)\n\nOne of Europe's hottest properties, Jovetic was wanted by Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez in the summer of 2009 only to stay at Fiorentina for four more years.\n\nHe ended up moving to England with Manchester City in 2013, but injuries there ensured he never really reached his potential, and after spells with Inter Milan and Sevilla he's now at Monaco.\n\nVaclav Kadlec (Sparta Prague)\n\nPrague-born, the Czech international is now back at Sparta Prague following moves to Eintracht Frankfurt, a loan back to Sparta and then FC Midtjylland.\n\nShinji Kagawa (Dortmund)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nA key part of Dortmund's 2011 and 2012 title winning teams, Kagawa was somewhat misused during two years at Manchester United, before he rejoined Dortmund.\n\nClosing in on 100 caps for Japan, he's now in Spain with Real Zaragoza.\n\nGael Kakuta (Chelsea)\n\nThe young Frenchman was caught up in a 'tapping up' scandal over his move from Lens to Chelsea in 2007, and that seemed to hang over him for the rest of his career.\n\nHe went on six loan spells away from Stamford Bridge - including at Fulham and Bolton - and after stopping by in various countries including Holland, Italy, Spain and China, he's now back in France with Amiens.\n\nAlan Kardec (Benfica)\n\nThe Brazilian striker never quite cut it at Benfica, but he's been prolific for Jordi Cruyff's Chinese Super League side Chongqing Dangdai Lifan since 2016.\n\nSimon Kjaer (Wolfsburg)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe Denmark captain has regularly been linked with Premier League moves, but is now on loan from Sevilla at Atalanta after spells with Roma, Lille and Fenerbahce.\n\nMaksim Koval (Dynamo Kiev)\n\nThe goalkeeper was a Dynamo player for nine years without being their No.1, and after four loan moves he joined Al-Fateh in Saudi Arabia this year.\n\nIsmail Koybasi (Besiktas)\n\nThe Turkey international made the controversial step from Besiktas to Fenerbahce in 2016, and is now in Spain with Granada.\n\nToni Kroos (Bayern)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLooked as though he\u2019d be a Bayern midfielder forever, before the summer of 2014 when he won the World Cup and joined Real Madrid, where he still resides.\n\nManuel Lanzini (River Plate)\n\nEnded up out in the UAE at Al Jazira via a spell in Brazil, before a West Ham masterstroke to bring him to the Premier League in the summer of 2015.\n\nFour years later he\u2019s still there, and a Hammers fans' favourite.\n\nAdem Ljajic (Fiorentina)\n\nThe Serbian attacking midfielder joined Besiktas permanently this summer after a successful loan spell last season, while he's got 41 international caps.\n\nDejan Lovren (Lyon)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAn impressive 2013/14 season at Southampton earned the Croatian a move to Liverpool, and he\u2019s still there despite some ups and downs.\n\nRomelu Lukaku (Anderlecht)\n\nTipped for the top from a very young age, the forward joined Chelsea shortly after turning 18 only to be farmed out on loan to West Brom and then Everton , joining the latter permanently.\n\nManchester United didn\u2019t work out from there, and now he\u2019s at Inter.\n\nLukman Haruna (Monaco)\n\nThe Nigerian had successful years with Dynamo Kiev as he also picked up 13 international caps, but he's now in Tunisia with Tataouine.\n\nFederico Macheda (Manchester United)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nForever remembered for *that* United goal against Aston Villa, the Italian forward\u2019s career has since taken in Sampdoria, QPR, Stuttgart, Doncaster, Birmingham, Cardiff , Nottingham Forest, Novara and now Panathinaikos.\n\nHe\u2019s still only 28.\n\nGuido Marilungo (Sampdoria)\n\nThe Italian forward has bounced around Serie A, B and now C with Ternana, but his goalscoring record has never been that special.\n\nMarko Marin (Werder Bremen)\n\nThe German got his move to Chelsea in 2012, from where he left on four separate loan spells before joining Olympiakos and now Red Star Belgrade.\n\nEmmanuel Mayuka (Young Boys)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe Zambian forward joined Southampton in 2012 but never really did anything, and so left for France, Israel and Egypt.\n\nNow 28, he's back home with the brilliantly named Green Buffaloes.\n\nThomas M\u00fcller (Bayern)\n\nThe 2014 World Cup winner is still at Bayern and probably will be forever, but his Germany career looks over after 100 caps.\n\nIker Muniain (Athletic Bilbao)\n\nLinked with pretty much everyone over the past decade, it is remarkable to think Munain is still only 26.\n\nHe's still at Bilbao, and captains them.\n\nMarc Muniesa (Barcelona)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe defender only played four games for Barca before leaving for Stoke in 2013, and after five years there he joined Girona, and now Al-Arabi.\n\nEzequiel Mu\u00f1oz (Palermo)\n\nThe centre-back stayed with Palermo until 2015, and is now back home in Argentina with Lanus.\n\nYann M'Vila (Rennes)\n\nCapped 22 times for France, the midfielder joined Rubin Kazan in 2013 and then had loans at Inter Milan and Sunderland, although he's now back in France with Saint-Etienne.\n\nTomas Necid (CSKA Moscow)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe 44-times capped Czech forward makes his living in Dutch football with ADO Den Haag, after a varied career which has taken him to Greece, Turkey and Poland.\n\nNeymar (Santos)\n\nAchieved world superstardom at Barcelona before getting his Ballon d\u2019Or-seeking move to PSG, and now wants to go back to the Nou Camp.\n\nSotiris Ninis (Panathinaikos)\n\nAlbania-born, the Greek international was highly-rated for a long time as he broke through in the game, but underwhelming spells at several clubs have now led him to Hapoel Ashkelon in Israel.\n\nNicolas Nkoulou (Monaco)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe long-serving Cameroon centre-back spent his best years with Marseille, and is these days at Torino.\n\nJavier Pastore (Palermo)\n\nThe Argentina international was seen as PSG's first big addition when they got him from Palermo in 2011, and he's now back in Italy with Roma.\n\nAlexandre Pato (Milan)\n\nFor years the Brazilian was considered to be the next big thing in both Brazilian and European football, but he never quite recaptured the initial form he showed when breaking through at Milan.\n\nNow 30, his career has taken in Corinthians, Sao Paulo, Chelsea, Villarreal, Tianjin Tianhai and now Sao Paulo again.\n\nPablo Piatti (Almer\u00eda)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA La Liga staple with over 100 games for each of Almeria and Valencia, the once-capped Argentinean is now well on the way to the same amount for Espanyol.\n\nMiralem Pjanic (Lyon)\n\nThe Bosnian shone at Lyon and has been lighting it up in Italy ever since 2011, first with Roma and now with Juventus.\n\nRafael (Manchester United)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe right-back was the more successful of the Da Silva twins at United, and now he\u2019s played over 100 games for Lyon.\n\nYaroslav Rakitskiy (Shakhtar)\n\nThe rough and ready defender spent 10 years in the Shakhtar first-team before joining Zenit earlier this year.\n\nDiego Renan (Cruzeiro)\n\nA Brazilian full-back, Renan has played for several clubs in his homeland and is now with Ponte Preta.\n\nMarco Reus (M\u00f6nchengladbach)\n\n(Image: Bongarts/Getty Images)\n\nJoined Borussia Dortmund in 2012 and is still there, establishing himself as one of the best attackers in the Bundesliga this decade.\n\nEmmanuel Riviere (Saint-Etienne)\n\nA France under-21 international, Riviere had a steady scoring record in Ligue 1 before joining Newcastle in 2014, and promptly scoring once in 26 Premier League games.\n\nHe's now in Italy's Serie B with Cosenza.\n\nJack Rodwell (Everton)\n\nTipped for the top at Goodison Park, Rodwell was said to have outgrown Everton by 2012, when he joined Manchester City for \u00a315million.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out there though, and the three-times capped England international is now without a club via an unhappy spell at Sunderland and a brief one at Blackburn.\n\nSalomon Rond\u00f3n (M\u00e1laga)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe powerful Venezuelan forward has been a handful wherever he\u2019s been, and after Malaga joined Rubin Kazan, Zenit St Petersburg, West Brom, Newcastle and now Dalian Yifang in China.\n\nVictor Ruiz (Espanyol)\n\nAfter a move to Napoli didn't work out well, the centre-back impressed at Valencia and Villarreal.\n\nNow 30, he's trying his luck outside of Spain again with Besiktas.\n\nMamadou Sakho (PSG)\n\nHad looked set to be a PSG figurehead before the money arrived and he lost his place.\n\nThe French centre-back joined Liverpool in 2013 and had his moments at Anfield before being shipped off to Crystal Palace .\n\nDavide Santon (Internazionale)\n\n(Image: DAILY RECORD)\n\nViewed as one of the next generation of Italian defenders to take over the mantle from the likes of Paolo Maldini, there was much excitement when Santon broke into the team at Inter. And then not much happened.\n\nHe's since gone to Newcastle, back to Inter, joined Roma and picked up eight Italy caps.\n\nGeorgi Shchennikov (CSKA Moscow)\n\nThe left-sided 28-year-old is still with CSKA, but although he was a part of the 2014 World Cup squad his international career has never quite taken off.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri (Basel)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe bright spark of the Swiss League spent time on the fringes at Bayern Munich and Inter before starring at Stoke, and now going back to the fringes at Liverpool.\n\nHarmeet Singh (Valerenga)\n\nA staple in Scandinavian football, the defensive midfielder has played for several clubs across Norway and Sweden, and is now with HJK Helsinki in the latter.\n\nMoussa Sissoko (Toulouse)\n\nShowed his Premier League midfield credentials at Newcastle before a move to Tottenham, where he eventually became a fans\u2019 favourite after a poor start.\n\nRobin Soder (Gothenburg)\n\nThe Swedish striker stayed with Gothenburg for several years, although he was never that prolific, and he's now back there after spells with Esbjerg and Lokeren in Belgium.\n\nMiroslav Stoch (Fenerbahce)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe small, squat Slovakian winger never quite made the grade at Chelsea, and these days finds himself at PAOK in Greece, the club he joined on his first loan move from Fenerbahce in 2013.\n\nYannis Tafer (Toulouse)\n\nThe forward never really cut it at Lyon, and after his loan to Toulouse he ended up at Lausanne-Sport and St Gallen in Switzerland, and now ES Sahel in Tunisia.\n\nThiago Alcantara (Barcelona)\n\nSeemed set to be Barca\u2019s next Xavi or Andres Iniesta before Pep Guardiola tempted him to Bayern Munich in 2013, and he\u2019s still there.\n\nLacina Traor\u00e9 (Cluj)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe 6ft 8ins Ivory Coast forward has gone full circle and is now back at Cluj via Anzhi Makhachkala, Monaco, Everton (two games, one goal), CSKA Moscow, Sporting Gijon, Amiens and Ujpest.\n\nRicky Van Wolfswinkel (Utrecht)\n\nAfter impressing at Sporting Lisbon the forward is now remembered in England for a 25 game, one goal Premier League spell with Norwich in 2013/14.\n\nThe twice-capped Dutch forward has since been seen at Saint-Etienne, Real Betis, Vitesse and now Basel.\n\nCarlos Vela ( Arsenal )\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nLooked to be a sure thing in terms of 'making it' as he broke through at Arsenal, but most of his experience at the Emirates seemed to come in the League Cup.\n\nEventually impressed at Real Sociedad before moving onto Los Angeles FC, where he's currently ripping it up.\n\nJelle Vossen (Genk)\n\nMiddlesbrough and Burnley feature among the forward's clubs, but he has always been more at home in Belgium, and has impressive scoring records for Genk and current employers Club Brugge.\n\nAnte Vukusic (Hadjuk Split)\n\nThe once-capped Croatian striker has never really impressed anywhere other than Hajduk Split, and he's now in Slovenia with Olimpija Ljubljana.\n\nTheo Walcott (Arsenal)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nA player tipped for great things never quite convinced everyone despite 397 games and 108 goals for Arsenal, and 47 caps for England.\n\nCan these days be spotted on Everton's bench.\n\nVladimir Weiss (Rangers)\n\nA third generation Slovakian footballer called Vladimir Weiss, the winger was on loan in Glasgow from Manchester City where he was highly-rated.\n\nHe's been with Al-Gharafa in Qatar since 2016.\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum (Feyenoord)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFirst made a move within Dutch football to PSV, and then after a season at Newcastle he\u2019s now a firm fixture at Liverpool after joining in 2016.\n\nJack Wilshere (Arsenal)\n\nTipped for the top for so long, Wilshere had his moments with Arsenal and England only for his fitness to let him down.\n\nStill doing a good job for West Ham though.\n\nDanny Wilson (Liverpool)\n\n(Image: Action Images)\n\nThere were comparisons with some of Liverpool\u2019s great Scots when the defender signed for the Reds in 2010, but he\u2019d only play nine games for the club.\n\nAfter stints at Blackpool, Bristol City, Hearts and Rangers, he\u2019s now in the MLS with Colorado Rapids.\n\nSiyanda Xulu (Mamelodi Sundowns)\n\nThe South African defender tried out European football with Rostov in 2012, which was also the year he won the first of seven international caps.\n\nNow with Maritzburg United back home.\n\nAndriy Yarmolenko (Dinamo Kiev)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian was linked with moves away from Dynamo Kiev for years, but ultimately didn\u2019t make one until 2017 when he joined Borussia Dortmund.\n\nAfter a year there he\u2019s impressing at West Ham.\n\nSercan Yildirim (Bursaspor)\n\nThe forward has never left Turkish football, but his big move to Galatasaray didn't quite work out as he was loaned out five times.\n\nNow with newly-promoted top-flight outfit Fatih Karagumruk.", "description": "We
