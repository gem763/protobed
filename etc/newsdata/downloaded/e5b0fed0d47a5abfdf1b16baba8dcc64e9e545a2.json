The index shed 0.6 per cent on Wednesday.\n\nMr Trump said a deal to end a nearly 15-month trade war with China could happen sooner than people think and that the Chinese were making big agricultural purchases from the United States.\n\nAustralian stocks are particularly sensitive to developments on the Sino-US trade front, since China is Australia's largest trading partner.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\n\"A comment that a deal is possible and that China wants to do a deal according to the White House, is not a concrete step towards any resolution and markets are still aware that this is a complicated negotiation and it could take longer,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.\n\nBrad Smoling, managing director at Smoling Stockbroking, said there may be news about some friendly chats between Washington and Beijing every now and then, but noted that there was not much optimism about a ground breaking deal anytime soon.\n\n\"Aside from some agricultural products like soya bean and pork, I don't think America has much to offer as part of the mix in a trade deal,\" Mr Smoling added.\n\nThe Australian gold index ended nearly 4 per cent down and was the worst performer on the benchmark, as gold prices fell early on Thursday and the dollar remained firm.\n\nGold explorer West African Resources slumped 5.5 per cent, while peer Silver Lake Resources shed about 5 per cent to its lowest since June 17.\n\nThe broader mining index fell almost 1 per cent to a more than over two-week low, dragged by weakness in iron ore and steel prices.\n\nThe energy subindex ended the day's session about 1 per cent lower, hurt by a decline in oil prices after US crude stockpiles unexpectedly rose and as Saudi Arabia maintained a faster-than-expected recovery of its oil production.\n\nMajor oil and gas player Woodside Petroleum ended 1.3 per cent lower and Santos Ltd was nearly 2 per cent lower.\n\nMost banks, including the Big Four, declined.
