The report illustrates how a series of mouse clicks on any web browser can expose the persistent URL of private posts and stories cached on Facebook servers.\n\nAnyone can use a web browser, like Google Chrome, to inspect the source code on a web page using the \u201cInspect Elements\u201d tool. By tabbing over to the \u201cImg\u201d section of the Network header, you\u2019re able to find the URL of any Instagram image you\u2019ve clicked on, be it a disappearing story or a photo posted to a user\u2019s feed. That URL can then be shared and the photo viewed by anyone, including people who do not follow the private account in question.\n\nInstagram\u2019s version of private is not so private\n\nThe Verge was able to independently verify that this process does indeed work. The process is somewhat finicky, but usually by reloading the page of a private account (in this case, my own) and loading the \u201cImg\u201d section, I was able to find the right URL and confirm it could be openly shared. Previews of the image even load in chat applications like Slack. We also confirmed another user was able to find the same URLs, to rule out the possibility that Instagram was only making available this type of data to a user looking at their own private account.\n\nIn addition to revealing persistent URLs for photos posted to a private account, the same source-code trick also lets you pull URLs for profile photos of other Instagram users who may have interacted with that post and may have their accounts set to private as well. Of course, you must follow the private account in the first place to have access to the user\u2019s feed and stories, but the flaw and the ease of exploiting it represent an oversight for Instagram\u2019s privacy and security teams.\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed, these URLs will still retrieve images from Facebook servers even after the posts have been deleted. This appears to be true both for photos posted to the feed and for stories, which delete after 24 hours. BuzzFeed says URLs for private stories will return the story for multiple days after the expiration date. The report also states that the same method works for retrieving URLs of private Facebook posts and photos, although The Verge has not yet been able to independently verify that.\n\nAccording to Facebook, this type of behavior \u2014 seeking out the URL of a private photo so it can be more easily shared publicly \u2014 is not dissimilar from taking a screenshot of a pos. The company says it has not seen any abuse related to this feature of its network. \u201cThe behavior described here is the same as taking a screenshot of a friend\u2019s photo on Facebook and Instagram and sharing it with other people. It doesn\u2019t give people access to a person\u2019s private account,\u201d a company spokesperson tells The Verge.\n\nUpdate September 9th, 9:35PM ET: Added statement from Facebook.", "description": "Instagram currently has a serious security flaw in how it handles accounts set to private, and a BuzzFeed News report today illustrates how a series of mouse clicks on any web browser can expose the persistent URL of private posts and stories cached on Facebook servers.", "authors": ["Nick Statt", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MAq6fNow3j6T6AzpDjKLFGiL3fU=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11560021/akrales_180614_1777_0229.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
