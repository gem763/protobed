The preliminary, partial deal was the biggest step toward\n\nresolving a 15-month tariff war between the world's two largest\n\neconomies.\n\nThe market had risen in recent days due to optimism for an\n\nagreement and the S&P 500 was up as much as about 1.9%\n\nearlier in the session.\n\n\"The main reason the market rallied the past couple of days\n\nwas hope that there would be an agreement, even a small\n\nagreement, and that this trade war would be done for the\n\nforeseeable future,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market\n\nstrategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\n\"It looks like while there is an agreement, this is still\n\ngoing to ... drag out and be an issue.\"\n\nTop-level discussions between the two countries concluded\n\ntheir second day on Friday. Cyclicals were among the day's best-performing groups, with\n\nthe S&P industrial index up about 2% ahead of the\n\nthird-quarter earnings season, which is set to begin next week.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 319.92 points,\n\nor 1.21%, to 26,816.59, the S&P 500 gained 32.14 points,\n\nor 1.09%, to 2,970.27 and the Nasdaq Composite added\n\n106.27 points, or 1.34%, to 8,057.04.\n\nIndexes also gained for the week, with the Dow and Nasdaq up\n\n0.9% each and the S&P 500 up 0.6%.\n\nThe timing of the trade news had a lot to do with the\n\nlate-day volatility, said Michael James, managing director of\n\nequity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.\n\n\"There were 15 minutes to go in the trading day on a Friday\n\n... after the Dow had risen 700 points in the last two days,\" he\n\nsaid. \"Anything that was less than a comprehensive agreement was\n\nlikely to see some degree of market sell off.\"\n\nAnalysts expect S&P 500 earnings to have declined 3.2%\n\nyear-on-year in the third quarter, which would mark the first\n\nfall since 2016, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nBets for another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve\n\nfell after data showed a rise in consumer sentiment for the\n\nmonth of October. Apple's stock rose 2.7% as Wedbush raised its price\n\ntarget, citing confidence in the company's new video streaming\n\nservice. The S&P industrial index was boosted by a 17.2% jump in\n\nshares of Fastenal Co after the industrial distributor\n\nbeat quarterly profit expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a\n\n3.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.08-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the\n\nNasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 60 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 7.59 billion shares, compared\n\nto the roughly 7 billion average for the full session over the\n\nlast 20 trading days.", "description": "US STOCKS-Wall Street jumps but ends off highs after partial trade deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE020QH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
