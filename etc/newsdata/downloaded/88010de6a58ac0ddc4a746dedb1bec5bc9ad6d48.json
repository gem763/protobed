It's the voice equivalent of deepfake videos that are causing alarm for their potential to manipulate public opinion and cause social discord.\n\nThe voice fraud incident was described to the WSJ by the energy company's insurer, Euler Hermes Group.\n\nThe insurer believes the scammer had used commercially available AI voice-generating software to carry out the fraud.\n\nThe UK-based CEO became suspicious when the fraudster called a third time requesting a second transfer and noticed the call was from an Austrian number. He didn't make any further transfers. However, the original transfer went to a Hungarian account under the scammers' control and was then transferred to Mexico.\n\nIt's not the first known case of deepfaked audio of CEO voices being used to trick financial controllers into transferring funds to fraudsters.\n\nThe BBC reported in July that Symantec had seen three similar cases where AI software had been used to spoof CEO voices. Victims lost millions of dollars in those cases.\n\nCEOs could be an easier target for AI-generated voice fraud because their voices are often contained in earnings calls, media appearances, YouTube videos, and conferences, offering scammers plenty of data to build a model of someone's voice.\n\nThe scam bears the hallmarks of an older fraud that's already caused massive losses in the US. That is, business email compromise, which cost US businesses $1.3bn in 2018 alone.\n\nSEE MORE: BEC overtakes ransomware and data breaches in cyber-insurance claims\n\nWhile BEC crime involves manipulating people through fraudulent email, the basic scam and goal are the same, albeit via a different medium.\n\nIt involves spoofing or compromising a senior officer's email account and emailing instructions for a financial controller to urgently transfer funds to an account controlled by the scammer.\n\nInsurance giant AIG (American International Group) recently reported that BEC-related issuance filings from the EMEA region accounted for 23% of all cyber-insurance claims it received in 2018. It was followed by ransomware, which accounted for 18% of these claims.\n\nMore on deepfakes, business computer fraud", "description": "AI-generated audio was used to trick a CEO into wiring $243,000 to a scammer's bank account.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/04/54544058-79da-46ff-95e9-50e7ae839585/thumbnail/770x578/87ffc83709cf64fb375d8eea456ecd7c/manlaptopphoneistock-1170710550.jpg"}
