If convicted, he could be sentenced to two to 10 years in prison.\n\nAccording to an affidavit by a Keller Police Department detective, Hamilton's daughter told police that he went on a rampage Sept. 30. She says she made a comment to Hamilton that upset him, so he threw a full bottle overhand at her, hitting her in the chest, then cursed and shouted at her. He pulled away the chair on which she rested her feet and threw it, breaking the chair. It didn't hit her, but he then grabbed her by the shoulders and lifted her from the chair on which she sat. She fell to the floor, and he lifted her up, threw her over his shoulder and carried her to her bedroom.\n\nThe girl said at this point she was telling Hamilton, \"I'm sorry.\" Upon reaching her bedroom door, he tossed the teen onto her bed, pressed her face onto the mattress and began hitting her legs with an open hand and closed fist.\n\nShe said that after he finished striking her, he told her, \"I hope you go in front of the f---ing judge and tell him what a terrible dad I am so I don't have to see you anymore and you don't have to come to my house again.\"\n\nAs he left the room, he told her to gather her things for school. When she replied that she had already put them in the car, he responded, \"Well, aren't you just the perfect child.\"\n\nThe Dallas Morning News reports that Hamilton's ex-wife Katie Hamilton, the mother of the children, had sought a protective order for the girl against Hamilton earlier this month.\n\nHamilton played for the Texas Rangers, Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Angels. This summer, he was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame.\n\n\"The Texas Rangers take the issue of family violence very seriously. We are aware of the situation involving Josh Hamilton. Since this is an ongoing legal matter, we have no further comment,\" the Rangers said in a statement.\n\nHamilton has an unlisted telephone number and couldn't be reached for comment. It was unclear if he has an attorney.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
