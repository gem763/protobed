(Alexei Druzhinin, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 From Syria to Ukraine, new fault lines and tensions are offering the Kremlin fresh opportunities to expand its clout and advance its interests.\n\nThe U.S. military withdrawal from northern Syria before a Turkish offensive leaves Russia as the ultimate power broker, allowing it to help negotiate a potential agreement between Syrian President Bashar Assad and the Kurds who were abandoned by Washington.\n\nAnd in Ukraine, where the new president saw his image dented by a U.S. impeachment inquiry, Russia may use the volatility to push for a deal that would secure its leverage over its western neighbor.\n\nThe Turkish offensive in northern Syria followed President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from the area, cold shouldering the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, the key U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nWashington's abrupt decision to ditch the Kurds contrasted sharply with Moscow's unwavering support for its ally Assad, which helped his government reclaim the bulk of the country's territory in a devastating civil war.\n\nAlong with military power, Russian President Vladimir Putin has relied on diplomacy to achieve his goals in Syria, reaching out to regional powers \u2014 from Iran to Saudi Arabia, Israel and Turkey.\n\nNATO member Turkey has become a particularly important partner for Russia. Even though the two countries have backed opposite sides in the Syrian conflict, they have pooled efforts to negotiate a de-escalation zone in the Syrian province of Idlib and co-sponsor talks on forming a committee that would draft a new Syrian constitution.\n\nThe Russia-Turkey rapprochement came as Ankara's relations with Washington grew increasingly chilly and were further strained over Turkey's recent purchase of Russian air defense missiles.\n\nTurkey's offensive in Syria, which has drawn harsh criticism from the U.S. and European Union, may now push Moscow and Ankara even closer.\n\n\"Russia wants to benefit from that operation, and one of the gains could be the strengthening of ties with Turkey,\" said Kirill Semenov of the Russian International Affairs Council. \"The harsh response from Washington, the EU reaction, the threat of sanctions against Turkey all play into Moscow's hands by making Moscow and Ankara even closer.\"\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Putin just before unleashing air strikes and an artillery barrage on Kurdish-controlled areas in Syria. Ankara charges that the Kurdish fighters in Syria are allied with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has led an insurgency against Turkey for 35 years.\n\nWhile Russia has noted the need to respect Syria's territorial integrity, it also has emphasized Turkey's right to ensure its security \u2014 a benevolent stance contrasting with the harsh Western criticism of the Turkish offensive.\n\nRussia has long urged the U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters in Syria to come back to Damascus' fold, an offer they may need to take more seriously now.\n\n\"We heard that both Syrian officials and representatives of Kurdish organizations expressed interest in Russia using its good relations with all parties to the process in arranging such talks,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters on Thursday. \"We will see what we can do.\"\n\nLavrov also pointed at another Moscow goal \u2014 brokering a dialogue between Turkey and Assad's government, something Ankara has strongly rejected in the past.\n\n\"It would be good for Russia to bring Ankara and Damascus to the table and have Ankara acknowledge the legitimacy of the regime in Damascus, if not Assad himself,\" Semenov said.\n\nIn another power game, Russia hopes to see major gains in its long-running effort to retain leverage over its neighbor Ukraine, a former Soviet republic looking to align itself with the West. In 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and threw its support behind a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine following the ouster of Ukraine's Moscow-friendly leader, moves that triggered bruising Western sanctions.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was elected by a landslide in April, has vowed to end the fighting, which has killed more than 13,000. Early this month, Ukraine, Russia and the rebels signed a tentative agreement to hold local elections in the east, a deal Zelenskiy insists conforms to a 2015 peace accord that was brokered by France and Germany.", "description": "From Syria to Ukraine, new fault lines and tensions are offering the Kremlin fresh opportunities to expand its clout and advance its interests.
