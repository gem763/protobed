But its full impact on the property market has yet to be seen.\n\nA lot will depend on what happens next, however, there are signs that expectations of a final departure may be starting to affect confidence in the housing market.\n\nPrices are up slightly compared with this time last year \u2013 up by 0.2 per cent in October, according to the latest Nationwide figures.

You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nYet buyers are still nervous.\n\nOnline Mortgage Advisor surveyed 2,400 UK homeowners. It found that almost half \u2013 46 per cent \u2013 would be nervous about buying a new home in the run-up to Brexit, whether it\u2019s a no deal or orderly EU exit.\n\nPete Mugleston, the managing director of the website, says: \u201cThe fact that almost as many people would be apprehensive about selling as would be apprehensive about buying surprised me as I would have expected the concerns to be related to a house price drop post-Brexit.\n\n\u201cIt suggests general uncertainty and a \u2018wait and see\u2019 mindset.\u201d\n\nThe trouble with such a mindset is that it makes it hard for anyone trying to sell right now.\n\nSo, if you are worried that Brexit might put a damper on your property plans, how can you make sure your home will attract even nervous buyers?\n\nWe asked the experts for their advice about selling your home quickly and for the best possible price, no matter what the climate.\n\nPrice it right\n\nThis is such a tricky balance for sellers. On the one hand, you don\u2019t want to sell your home for less than it\u2019s true value \u2013 you need that money for your next property.\n\nBut also, if buyers are nervous then a competitively priced home could be what ensures you sell.\n\nLucy Pendleton, a founder director of independent estate agents James Pendleton, says: \u201cPrice your property keenly or risk sitting on the sidelines watching everyone else move.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good advice in any market but it\u2019s particularly important now with prices falling in many areas. Buyers are more price sensitive in times of uncertainty and, until Brexit is a thing of the past, house hunters won\u2019t feel overly confident their new home will retain its value in the short term.\n\n\u201cA steep asking price will just put people off viewing your home and being greedy also gives the impression you\u2019re not open for business and won\u2019t negotiate.\n\n\u201cGet buyers bidding for your home by lowering the price to about 5 per cent below what you think it is worth, and watch a river, not a trickle, of house hunters flood through your door.\u201d\n\nDo your own price checks too\n\nPhil Spencer, a TV property specialist and co-founder of Move iQ, an advice site for buyers and sellers, says it\u2019s never been more important to do your own research into the value of your home.\n\nOtherwise, you risk being misled by agents who want your business.\n\n\u201cMost important of all is getting the price right,\u201d he says. \u201cFewer sellers mean estate agents may give you an overly optimistic valuation in order to win your business.\n\n\u201cBut over-egging your asking price in a slow market is risky. Homes that sit unsold for many months, and where the seller has reduced the price a couple of times \u2013 or changed agents \u2013 can become \u2018burnt\u2019. Buyers will start to assume there is something wrong with the property, which can trigger a downward spiral on price.\n\n\u201cSo make sure you get as many valuations as possible, and do your own research into the local market, before setting your initial price.\u201d\n\nMake the most of the season\n\nIt\u2019s cold, it\u2019s dark and that can make selling feel more difficult. However, it also gives sellers a chance to make their home appear even cosier and more appealing.\n\nSam Mitchell, the CEO of online estate agent Housesimple, says: \u201cIf you\u2019re organising viewings in the lead up to Christmas, put the effort into dressing your home for the festive season, especially the first room the viewers will walk into.\n\n\u201cFor example, throw some blankets and cushions on the couches and beds and light a few scented candles around the house. Fairy lights are also great at making your home look cosy and Christmassy.\n\n\u201cIdeally, focus most of your attention on the first room viewers will see. This, in particular, should be decluttered, smelling fresh, welcoming and homely.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t despair\n\nDilpreet Bhagrath, a mortgage spokesperson at online mortgage broker Trussle, says that we may think winter is quiet but Boxing Day is one of the busiest days of the year for online property searches.\n\n\u201cDespite colder weather and longer nights, winter can be a good time to put your property on the market to get yourself prepared for selling and moving in the New Year,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIn December, buyers might have a bit more time to browse properties online in preparation to viewing them in the coming months.\u201d\n\nPace yourself\n\nWhile selling and buying can sometimes happen fast, it is most often a slow process. A recent analysis from estate agent comparison site GetAgent.co.uk shows that it now takes an average of 247 days to sell a home, counting from the day it is listed to the day it is marked as sold by the Land Registry.\n\nColby Short, the CEO of the website, says it\u2019s worse for the more expensive properties.\n\n\u201cMarket uncertainty has certainly hit the top end of the market hardest and the more inflated areas of the UK property market are some of those seeing the longest times to sell,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis is largely due to hesitation from buyers but also because home sellers are failing to adjust their price expectations in line with the current landscape.\n\n\u201cAt the other end of the scale, the more affordable pockets that have seen little or no reduction in values and where both buyers and sellers are approaching with a \u2018business as usual\u2019 attitude, are the areas where the time to sell is at its lowest.\u201d\n\nSelling a home can feel challenging at the best of times, let alone during a period of such economic uncertainty. But, by preparing properly and arming themselves with the right pricing data and a well-presented home, sellers stand the best chance of securing a quick sale and for the best price possible.", "description": "We know\u00a0Brexit has generated a huge amount of uncertainty that\u2019s affecting people, industries and markets in different ways.
