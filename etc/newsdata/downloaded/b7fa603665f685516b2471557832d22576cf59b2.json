(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nEven though the transcript of the July phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky proves that there was no quid pro quo discussion, impeachment fever continues to gain momentum in the fever swamps of the Democratic party.\n\nTrump, who has insisted all along that the media and Democrats have manufactured outrage over a non-story, was asked today after the transcript was released about whether or not he\u2019d spoken to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the impeachment issue. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s lost her way,\u201d Trump said, responding to a question regarding whether he tried to strike a deal on impeachment with Pelosi.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been taken over by the radical Left. She may be radical Left herself, but she really has lost her way,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI spoke to her about guns yesterday. She didn\u2019t even know what I was talking about.\u201d\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\u201cThe whole party is taken over by the Left,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been taken over by a radical group of people, and Nancy Pelosi, as far as I\u2019m concerned, unfortunately, she\u2019s no longer the speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nJudging from the context, what Trump was suggesting was that while Pelosi is officially Speaker of the House, she\u2019s not really running the show anymore. Members of the AOC-led Squad, who have long pushed for impeachment, are among the House\u2019s de facto far left leaders right now in the eyes of many Republicans, including Trump.\n\nSadly, the mainstream media have still not learned any lessons from their gross misreporting (to put it charitably) of the Mueller investigation, the \u201cblockbuster\u201d new sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Ukraine phone call, and now this.\n\nAs evidence, read the tweets and stories below, which show how badly journalists collectively stepped on a rake this afternoon in responding to Trump\u2019s remarks after others in the media, including the Associated Press\u2019 Zeke Miller, predictably tweeted the comments out of context:\n\nTrump: \"Nancy Pelosi, as far as I'm concerned, unfortunately, she's no longer the Speaker of the House\" \u2014 Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) September 25, 2019\n\nMedia firefighters and liberal commentators alike (but I repeat myself) donned their superhero capes in a rush to defend Pelosi:\n\nThat's, uh, not how it works\u2026 https://t.co/XCeWrBkQJU \u2014 Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) September 25, 2019\n\nThe president doesn't get to decide that. https://t.co/YvIdJiDHEN \u2014 Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) September 25, 2019\n\nTrump ends the press conference by saying Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House. Don't think that's the way it works. \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) September 25, 2019\n\nAgain, Trump is going to say completely absurd shit like Nancy Pelosi is no longer Speaker of the House because it is utterly impossible for him to defend himself on the merits. He's terrified, and he should be. \u2014 Ethan Grey (@_EthanGrey) September 25, 2019\n\nPerhaps the worst example comes from Roll Call\u2019s John T. Bennett, who actually framed the story from the bogus perspective that Trump was trying to undermine Pelosi, even though the President\u2019s comments clearly indicate he was hinting that it was the Impeachment Caucus who were undermining Pelosi. Here\u2019s how Bennett\u2019s piece started out (bolded emphasis added by me):\n\nRefusing to back away from a major political scandal, President Donald Trump undermined Speaker Nancy Pelosi while lobbing new allegations of corruption at one of Democratic 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden\u2019s sons.\n\nBut it was what he wrote later in the piece after quoting Trump saying Pelosi was \u201cno longer the speaker\u201d that had heads crashing to desks:\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, she\u2019s no longer the speaker of the House,\u201d Trump said before dismissing a group of reporters.\n\n\n\nPelosi is, in fact, the speaker. A sitting president cannot dismiss a speaker as easily as the travel pool covering him at a gathering of world leaders.\n\nThis is just straight up liberal bias. No question about it. Trump was not literally \u201cdismissing\u201d her as Speaker of the House, and the line about him dismissing \u201cthe travel pool\u201d is something you\u2019d expect an unhinged liberal CNN commentator like April Ryan to state rather indignantly, not a supposedly objective news reporter.\n\nBennett, who lists himself as a senior White House correspondent in his Twitter bio, unquestionably editorialized a number of times in what was supposed to be a straight news piece.\n\nI tagged him in a tweet about it after I discovered what he\u2019d written, but as of this writing he has yet to respond:\n\nThis take from @RollCall's @BennettJohnT provides a perfect example of why there is so little trust for the MSM anymore. It's clear Trump was not speaking *literally* of Pelosi not being speaker, just that he believed the far left had effectively taken over her position. pic.twitter.com/CT0XAcFzCP \u2014 Sister Toldjah \ud83d\ude01 (@sistertoldjah) September 25, 2019\n\nFor the record, here is the video of Trump\u2019s full remarks about Pelosi:\n\nTRUMP SLAMS PELOSI: \"Look, she's lost her way. She's been taken over by the radical left. She may be a radical left herself but she really has lost her way.\" \"Nancy Pelosi, unfortunately, she's no longer the Speaker of the House\" pic.twitter.com/CJ3RLuRAp8 \u2014 Breaking911 (@Breaking911) September 25, 2019\n\nWhat Trump was saying there should be obvious to just about everyone, but I\u2019m not considered a Real Reporter\u2122 in certain circles so maybe I missed something in the translation\u2026\n\n\u2014-\n\n\u2014 Based in North Carolina, Sister Toldjah is a former liberal and a 15+ year veteran of blogging with an emphasis on media bias, social issues, and the culture wars.
