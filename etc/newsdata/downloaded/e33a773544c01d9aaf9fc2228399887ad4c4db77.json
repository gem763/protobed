He will be laid to rest at Har Hamenuchot cemetery in Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu, President Reuven Rivlin and other top Israeli officials were in attendance for the public funeral. Shamgar is credited with shaping much of Israel\u2019s legal system as the Israeli Defense Force chief lawyer and, later, the attorney general and Supreme Court justice and president.\n\n\u201cMeir\u2019s unique contribution to shaping the legal system is priceless,\u201d Netanyahu said, according to the Times of Israel. \u201cHis firm and consistent belief in freedom of speech, individual liberties and tolerance is reflected in every judgment he made, as is his recognition of the supreme importance of state security.\u201d\n\nShamgar is credited with developing the legal framework for Israel to occupy the West Bank, a decision that\u2019s still in effect today. His decision has been called the \u201cbelligerant occupation\u201d by Palestinians but Shamgar also put significant limits on what Israel can do in the West Bank.\n\nHe founded the IDF West Bank Court system to handle Palestinian crimes. And Palestinians could appeal court rulings to the Supreme Court even though they weren\u2019t officially citizens.\n\nHe served on the Supreme Court chief justice for 12 years, the longest in Israeli history. He extended the power of the Supreme Court to review a variety of government and Knesset decisions.\n\n\u201cPresident Shamgar is a key figure in Israeli law,\u201d Justice Aharon Barak said. \u201cHe is a cornerstone of Israel\u2019s judicial history. The reality is that the judicial creation is a continuum that in which every just adds a link to the never-ending chain, and Shamgar likely added one of the most important of these links. On foundations laid by his predecessors, he built new and original structures, laying the base for new developments in Israeli law.\u201d\n\nShamgar was born in 1925 in Danzig, Poland. His parents were Russian and were members of the Revisionist Party. But young Shamgar belonged to the Beitar youth movement. Poland was captured by Nazi Germany. He fought for the Irgun and was arrested by British forces in 1944. He studied law by correspondence while in jail. Upon his release, he completed his studies in history and philosophy at Hebrow University of Jerusalem.", "description": "Oct. 22 (UPI) \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke at the funeral of former Israeli Supreme Court President Meir Shamgar in the Supreme", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
