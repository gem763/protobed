I hope you can all forgive me ... let me be a new person and give me the opportunity to return to society.\u201d\n\nWhile Chan has offered to surrender himself voluntarily, Hong Kong and Taiwan have clashed over the next steps.\n\nAn extradition bill would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent from Hong Kong to greater China, including the mainland, Taiwan and Macau.\n\nThe government has announced it will withdraw the bill but the protests have not stopped. The city\u2019s legislature is due to withdraw it formally on Wednesday.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Secretary for Security John Lee said on Wednesday that Taiwanese authorities were obstructing the case for \u201cpolitical reasons\u201d and Chan should be free to go to Taiwan and surrender himself.\n\nChan Tong-kai, a Hong Kong citizen who was accused of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan last year, leaves from Pik Uk Prison, in Hong Kong, China October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nTaiwan has argued that his extradition without a legal assistance framework would damage Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty and put Taiwan under the \u201cone China\u201d framework.\n\nBeijing considers Taiwan to be a wayward province of \u201cone China\u201d, ineligible for state-to-state relations, and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement earlier on Wednesday it was \u201cunbelievable\u201d that Chan could be expected to take a flight to Taiwan by himself, \u201ccompletely ignoring the safety of passengers on the same flights in order to serve the political arrangement of a \u2018surrender\u2019\u201d.\n\nIt said Taiwan had repeatedly asked for legal cooperation.\n\n\u201cWe are solemnly telling the Hong Kong government that you have to take full responsibility for all bitter consequences,\u201d the council statement said.\n\nTaiwan has also said it wanted to send officers to Hong Kong to escort Chan back to the self-ruled island upon his release, a move the Hong Kong government has described as a disrespectful and unacceptable attempt to cross legal jurisdictions.\n\nTaiwan President Tsai Ing-wen weighed in on Wednesday, saying Taiwan would \u201ctake care of the matter\u201d adding there was no \u201csuch thing as surrender, only arrest\u201d.\n\nChan was arrested by Hong Kong police in March 2018 and authorities there were only able to find evidence against him for money laundering.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam reluctantly agreed to withdraw the extradition bill two-and-a-half months after anti-government protests escalated in June, although its formal withdrawal is unlikely to end the unrest.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they see as Beijing encroaching on Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula enshrined during the handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997. That formula allows the city wide-ranging freedoms not available on the mainland, such as an independent judiciary.\n\nThe extradition bill was seen as the latest move by Beijing to erode those freedoms. China has denied such claims and accuses foreign countries of fomenting trouble.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nThe Financial Times, citing people briefed on the deliberations, reported on Monday China is drawing up a plan to replace Lam with an \u201cinterim\u201d chief executive.\n\n(Corrects to say \u201csentenced\u201d in third paragraph.)", "description": "A murder suspect whose case was used by the Hong Kong government to push for a controversial extradition bill walked free from jail on Wednesday as the city's authorities squabbled with Taiwan over how to handle a promised voluntary surrender.", "authors": ["Twinnie Siu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443981246&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M05V", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
