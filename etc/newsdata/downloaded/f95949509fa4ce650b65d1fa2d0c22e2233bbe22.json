That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that he should imitate some of Putin\u2019s least effective policies \u2013 such as declaring war on European cheese.\n\nIn the U.S., a 25% tariff on cheese imported from the European Union kicks in on Oct. 18. In 2014, Russia banned EU cheese, and a long list of other products, in retaliation for European sanctions imposed on Russia for its aggression against Ukraine.\n\nFor Putin, the embargo\u2019s goal was twofold: To hit Europeans where it hurt and to give domestic producers a chance to develop in areas where they were stunted by competition from imports. Cheese manufacturing was one such area. In 2013, Russia produced 330,000 metric tons (727 million pounds) of cheese and imported 356,000 metric tons from the EU. Trump\u2019s goals in his trade war are similar: He\u2019s punishing the EU for \u201ctreating the U.S.A. very badly\u201d on trade and trying to boost domestic production and jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how he\u2019ll achieve either of those goals with cheese, especially if the Russian experience is any guide. It\u2019s consumers who ended up punished.\n\nThe embargo did boost domestic cheese production by eliminating competition. But local producers never made up for the drop in EU imports.\n\nThey didn\u2019t have to. Suddenly, they could charge much more for their often inferior products. They had no idea how to replicate Roquefort; matching its price turned out to be easier.\n\nRussians responded by switching to what are kindly called \u201ccheese products\u201d made with vegetable fats like palm oil. In 2013, only 87,000 metric tons of such cheese-like foods were produced. By 2016, their output jumped to 136,000 tons, increasing at a faster rate than the output of actual cheese.\n\nIn recent months, the trend has reversed \u2013 cheese consumption is on the rise and substitutes are down. But that change is driven by increasing imports rather than by domestic production, which has largely flattened out. Importers have found new suppliers that aren\u2019t affected by the embargo, many of them in neighboring Belarus, where European cheeses are often repackaged as local for sale to Russia. Some people have even taken the matter into their own hands, buying cheese on trips to Europe. The pungent smell of ripe cheese sometimes wafts through return flights to Moscow.\n\nThe effects of Trump\u2019s new tariffs in the U.S. will be milder. For one thing, the U.S. imported just 134,000 metric tons of cheese from the EU last year, only about 2% of total consumption; for another, the potential for local producers\u2019 price increases is limited to 25%, a price jump true cheese lovers will probably grudgingly accept in order to keep eating real Gouda, Pecorino or any number of blue-veined cheeses. But some change inevitably will occur: U.S. producers of specialty cheeses will happily raise their prices, and as a result, some consumers will switch to cheaper, mass-produced, processed cheese.\n\nU.S. cheese artisans have made much progress in recent years when it comes to quality. With Trump\u2019s tariffs shielding them from the European competition, there won\u2019t be much need for them to keep improving, but they\u2019ll be able to charge more. Meanwhile, the mostly small companies that import European cheeses \u2013 about $1 billion worth of them last year \u2013 may be threatened because switching to local products is unlikely to set off the potential drop in imports. In Russia, \u201cimport substitution\u201d failed to do that.\n\nAs for the EU, it\u2019ll probably survive the U.S. tariffs with minimal losses. It reacted to the Russian embargo with some emergency aid to food producers, with the dairy sector receiving 770 million euros ($846 million). Cheese exports dropped slightly, but then quickly recovered and continued growing.\n\nBy following in Putin\u2019s footsteps, Trump won\u2019t punish the EU as much as U.S. consumers and small businesses. The domestic industry will get something of a windfall, but, if the Russian example is any indication, it won\u2019t use it effectively.\n\nThe best way to fight unfair trade practices \u2013 for the EU sets prohibitive tariffs that can exceed 60% on some kinds of cheese \u2013 isn\u2019t to retaliate. It\u2019s to drive down prices and keep working on quality and the international reputation of U.S. products. U.S. cheesemakers still have a lot of work to do on those fronts. It\u2019s counterproductive to protect them from higher-quality competition.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- U.S. President Donald Trump is known to admire his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.
