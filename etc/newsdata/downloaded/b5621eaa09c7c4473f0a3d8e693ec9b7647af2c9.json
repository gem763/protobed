Swiss National Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan all kept their policies on hold on Thursday. Norges Bank increased its key policy rate, moving its rates in the opposite direction of Europe and the United States. central banks are generally \"kind of holding their breath and holding their fire in terms of fully acknowledging that further easing could come down the road but not moving in a proactive way towards additional easing,\" said Brian Daingerfield, head of G10 FX strategy at NatWest Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Fed as expected cut interest rates by a quarter point to support a record-long economic expansion but signaled a higher bar for further reductions in borrowing costs amid a favorable economic outlook. the other hand, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) on Thursday cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020. U.S. gross domestic product is expected to rise 2.4% this year, down from a forecast 2.8% growth in May, the group said. late U.S. trading, the euro was up 0.19% at $1.1051, while the greenback was 0.42% lower at 107.99 yen.\n\nThe dollar shed 0.53% at 0.99235 Swiss franc, and declined 0.32% to C$1.3254.\n\nThe greenback fell to a five-week low at 8.9688 Norwegian crown before erasing its earlier losses.\n\nSome analysts also attributed lower demand for the greenback as stress in U.S. money markets has subsided with the Fed injecting over $200 billion in temporary cash into the banking system since Tuesday.\n\n\"The shortage of dollars has eased somewhat. With a possible crisis averted, you have people moving back into other currencies,\" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.\n\nMeanwhile, the British pound posted a late lift after Juncker said \"I think we can have a deal\" if the Irish border backstop, which the British government wants removed, could be replaced with alternatives.\n\nFollowing Juncker's comments, sterling GBP=D3 hit $1.256, its highest since July 15 and $88.04 pence per euro, a level not seen since late May. ========================================================\n\nCurrency bid prices at 3:06PM (1906 GMT) Description\n\nU.S. Close Pct Change\n\nYTD Pct\n\nHigh Bid\n\nLow Bid\n\nPrevious\n\nChange\n\nSession\n\nEuro/Dollar\n\n$1.1051\n\n$1.1029\n\n+0.20%\n\n-3.64%\n\n+1.1073\n\n+1.1024 Dollar/Yen\n\n107.9700\n\n108.4400\n\n-0.43%\n\n-2.07%\n\n+108.4600 +107.8000 Euro/Yen\n\nEURJPY=\n\n119.33\n\n119.60\n\n-0.23%\n\n-5.46%\n\n+119.6600 +118.9800 Dollar/Swiss\n\n0.9923\n\n0.9973\n\n-0.50%\n\n+1.11%\n\n+0.9983\n\n+0.9901 Sterling/Dollar GBP=\n\n1.2534\n\n1.2468\n\n+0.53%\n\n-1.75%\n\n+1.2559\n\n+1.2439 Dollar/Canadian CAD=\n\n1.3255\n\n1.3284\n\n-0.22%\n\n-2.80%\n\n+1.3307\n\n+1.3242 Australian/Doll AUD=\n\n0.6799\n\n0.6827\n\n-0.41%\n\n-3.55%\n\n+0.6832\n\n+0.6781 ar\n\nEuro/Swiss\n\nEURCHF=\n\n1.0966\n\n1.1000\n\n-0.31%\n\n-2.56%\n\n+1.1017\n\n+1.0957 Euro/Sterling\n\nEURGBP=\n\n0.8816\n\n0.8841\n\n-0.28%\n\n-1.87%\n\n+0.8893\n\n+0.8805 NZ\n\n0.6304\n\n0.6320\n\n-0.25%\n\n-6.13%\n\n+0.6331\n\n+0.6299 Dollar/Dollar\n\nDollar/Norway\n\n8.9694\n\n8.9450\n\n+0.27%\n\n+3.83%\n\n+8.9835\n\n+8.8885 Euro/Norway\n\nEURNOK=\n\n9.9115\n\n9.8652\n\n+0.47%\n\n+0.06%\n\n+9.9277\n\n+9.8124 Dollar/Sweden\n\n9.6857\n\n9.7251\n\n-0.21%\n\n+8.05%\n\n+9.7388\n\n+9.6739 Euro/Sweden\n\nEURSEK=\n\n10.7043\n\n10.7272\n\n-0.21%\n\n+4.29%\n\n+10.7551\n\n+10.6970", "description": "FOREX-Dollar falls as some central banks outside U.S. hold rates steady", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEABG0ZM_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
