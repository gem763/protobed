Somebody who could be relied upon to get well into double figures in terms of goals every season for their club.\n\n'Instead he\u2019s stagnated. Why? Will he point to the hamstring injuries he\u2019s had? Is he blaming the training at Tottenham or his team-mates? He has to look at himself first, in the mirror in the morning when he\u2019s shaving, and ask: \u201cWhy have I not progressed?\u201d'\n\nGraeme Souness feels Alli should look to Harry Kane as he bids to recapture his best form\n\nSouness pointed to the example of his team-mate Harry Kane, who has been consistent for Spurs despite a host of injury problems, and suggested that Alli may have lost his drive to succeed as a footballer.\n\n'He needs to ask why Harry Kane has kicked on and handled all the peripheral stuff that comes with being a top player, and he hasn\u2019t.\n\n'Can he honestly say he\u2019s been fully focused on his football or has he forgotten what made him kick a ball in the first place?\n\n'It should still be the priority. Why would you allow your eye to be taken off the ball? When you were a little boy you loved doing it, so get back to the basics of being in love with the game again.'\n\nAs Alli's value has gone up in recent years after becoming a key man for both Spurs and England, he has agreed a number of commercial deals, such as with online fashion site BooHoo.\n\nBut it is thought the midfielder is now looking to cut back after being left out of Gareth Southgate's recent England squad, and Souness feels it provides a chance for Alli to find his feet again - noting his concern that too many young stars are distracted by the lucrative lifestyle.\n\nAlli famously scored against Crystal Palace after juggling the ball and flicking it over his head\n\nHe added: 'That\u2019s a sensible first step towards getting back to his best, to the player who scored 23 goals in 57 games for club and country in 2016-17, rather than the one who managed seven in 45 games last season.\n\n'I\u2019m always concerned that young players stagnate as Alli has because they get too much, too soon.\n\n'There\u2019s never been a more lucrative era to be a professional in Britain, but the danger is that if you give them the dosh they get into their armchairs and don\u2019t fulfil their promise as players. It happens too often to be a coincidence.'\n\nAlli has started Tottenham's last two games as he looks to kickstart his career - scoring a late goal against Watford as the club drew 1-1 in their last league game and starring in midfield as Red Star were thrashed 5-0.", "description": "The 23-year-old has failed to recapture his irresistible goal-scoring form from when he first joined Spurs, netting just seven goals in all competitions last season and only one strike this term.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/08/20237896-0-image-a-3_1572166787730.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
