If no agreement is in place by Saturday \u2013 when parliament will meet for an extraordinary weekend sitting \u2013 the prime minister by law has to ask for a delay.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

We\u2019re going to wait what Michel Barnier and his team have achieved with British counterparts.\u201d\n\nEU27 leaders are today at best expected to give the deal \u201cpolitical\u201d approval and words of encouragement \u2013 which may not be enough for MPs back in Westminster.\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine leaders tomorrow being able to say anything more than \u2018this doesn\u2019t look too bad, let\u2019s continue to work with the UK to finalise the details\u2019,\u201d a senior EU diplomat said on Wednesday, less than 24 hours ahead of the meeting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there can only be political agreement tomorrow and Friday because we haven\u2019t seen any texts: we can\u2019t say yes without having done legal scrubbing. It can only be a political yes, we need much more time.\u201d\n\nMember states have been kept mostly in the dark about the details of talks so far, with the Commission\u2019s team in a \u201ctunnel\u201d with the British side.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We\u2019ll have to see what we get from Michel Barnier,\u201d one diplomat said.\n\n\u201cThe more the deal is different from what we had prepared early 2018, the more time it will take for legal experts and customs experts to judge. The closer it is to what we had prepared a year and a half ago the easier it will be.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

There\u2019s just not enough time. We don\u2019t need that, we can only give a political yes and come back to it another time.\u201d\n\nSketchy reports from inside the negotiating room were hot and cold all day on Wednesday, with a meeting of EU ambassadors sliding first from 2pm to 5pm, and then finally to 7pm. A planned UK cabinet meeting also slipped back to accommodate the overrunning talks.\n\nUltimately, disagreement about what VAT regime would apply to Northern Ireland prevented a deal on Wednesday, despite progress on customs and \"consent\" for the territory's institutions. Ambassadors leaving the 7pm meeting with Mr Barnier were concerned that there was no legal text for them to scrutinise.\n\nBack in Westminster the prime minister addressed his backbenchers at the Tory Party\u2019s 1922 Committee \u2013 whose support he needs to pass any plan.\n\nSpeaking outside the committee room, Tory MP Bim Afolami said: \u201cTo use a mountaineering metaphor, we are at Hillary Steppe. The summit, you can see it but it\u2019s shrouded in cloud. But we can see it, we will get there.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that is too late to give a formal yes at this European Council. EU diplomat\n\nBrexiteer Bernard Jenkin said Tory MPs have been \u201cvindicated\u201d for voting against Theresa May\u2019s deal, as he believed Boris Johnson had \u201cgot a different deal\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey [the EU] reopened the withdrawal agreement, which under Theresa May they never said they would.\u201d\n\nHe claimed there was great support for the PM in the party, but added it would be difficult to back a deal in parliament without seeing the legal text.\n\nThe DUP, whose support Mr Johnson also needs, were more enigmatic. During the afternoon leader Arlene Foster slapped down reports that her party had agreed to concessions, snapping at an Irish journalist that his EU sources were \u201ctalking nonsense\u201d.\n\nEU leaders will start arriving in Brussels for this week\u2019s summit after lunch on Thursday. The meeting will continue into Friday afternoon, with other items on the agenda including the EU budget, enlargement of the union, and a common response to Turkish military action in northern Syria.\n\nIt is expected to be followed by a rare emergency sitting the House of Commons on Saturday, where MPs will discuss the outcome of the summit and plot a way forward. Under UK law the prime minister must ask the EU for an extension if no deal has been secured by Saturday.", "description": "Boris Johnson was on the brink of striking a new Brexit deal on Wednesday night, but still faces an uphill fight to keep his pledge to leave the EU at the end of the month.
