Activists will stop traffic from around 9am onwards at 12 different sites around parliament, including Trafalgar Square, Horse Guards Parade, the Mall, Victoria Street, and Westminster and Vauxhall bridges, among others.\n\nThroughout the week activists plan to take action around Westminster at government departments, to blockade Smithfield market, then later move on to London City airport, where they intend to stage a three-day protest.\n\nHowever, even senior members of XR say they do not know the full scale or extent of intended protests as many are being organised autonomously. Independent solidarity actions under the banner of international XR groups are also expected in about 60 cities around the world.\n\nXR UK claims to have recruited five times as many activists as during the last major protests in April, when more than 1,100 were arrested at blockades of four major London sites that lasted about a week.\n\nMetropolitan police commanders \u2013 after coming under fire for not ending those protests sooner \u2013 have said they are planning to be more proactive and agile in their response. Specialist police teams have been drafted in from around the country to remove protesters who try to lock or glue themselves in place.\n\nHowever, the activists believe their decentralised command structures and weight of numbers will overwhelm the police response. \u201cEveryone will be like water and move to more disruptive locations if [police] don\u2019t let them take the sites,\u201d one told the Guardian.\n\nActivists have also been instructed to refuse bail when arrested, in the hope they can fill up all of the Met\u2019s holding cells and prevent police from making more arrests.\n\nOn Saturday, officers from the force\u2019s territorial support group raided a building in south London and seized equipment that activists had planned to use. Seven women and three men were arrested for conspiracy to cause a public nuisance\n\nOfficers used a battering ram to force their way in. However, a source within XR said that while officers were breaking in through the front door, activists were smuggling \u201ca whole pile of stuff\u201d out of the back.", "description": "Environmental activists plan to blockade roads in the centre of government for two weeks", "authors": ["Damien Gayle", "Lisa Nandy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b3274d1f4ecccc98dfc8524e4793cd45f7a0c5d/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d417bceecca7d79d2bc16990f4a7b323", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
