REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe company also voiced its grief over the Oct. 29, 2018 crash after take off from Jakarta that killed all 189 people on board, a response that marked a shift in tone compared with its reaction to a preliminary report last November.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg outlined changes planned for the so-called MCAS cockpit software that has been widely linked to the accident and the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet five months later.\n\n\u201cWe are addressing the (Indonesian accident agency) KNKT\u2019s safety recommendations and taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 MAX to prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company\u2019s previous statement, which included no comment from Boeing leaders and was viewed as clumsy by some family representatives, indirectly pointed the finger at Lion Air\u2019s cockpit and ground crew by listing questions that the report hadn\u2019t answered.\n\nSenior aviation officials, speaking privately, as well as analysts and some Boeing insiders expressed surprise at the time, saying the statement tested the limits of a U.N.-backed agreement to prevent parties commenting on live investigations.\n\nThe rules against speaking out during investigations are usually strictly followed by all planemakers including Boeing.\n\n\u201cBoeing made a crucial misstep last year by attempting to deflect responsibility to third parties,\u201d said Ronn Torossian, chief executive of New York PR firm 5WPR.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is, organizations that admit fault and actively work to solve issues always come out looking more favourable than those who place blame on others.\u201d\n\nWith dozens of lawsuits pending, Boeing has not admitted liability. But in March it acknowledged that MCAS was one link in a wider chain of events when an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX also crashed, leading to a worldwide grounding of the fleet.\n\nIn their final report on Friday, Indonesian investigators highlighted design flaws in MCAS software while also revealing errors or confusion among crew and faulting airline operations.\n\n\u201cIt was not wise to blame the pilots after the first report and it could have been said differently,\u201d said Paul Hayes, safety director at UK-based consultancy Ascend by Cirium.\n\n\u201cYes, there were pilot errors but they should never been placed in that position inside the cockpit,\u201d he added.\n\nA Boeing spokesman said it had no further comment.\n\nHUMBLED\n\n\u201cWe mourn with Lion Air, and we would like to express our deepest sympathies to the Lion Air family,\u201d Muilenburg\u2019s statement on Friday said.\n\nThe statements bookended one of the most challenging years in Boeing\u2019s history, with the planemaker battling to restore trust and facing over $8 billion in costs.\n\nMuilenburg was criticized for wooden appearances at the start of the 737 MAX crisis and but has said Boeing has been humbled by the two crashes, in which a total of 346 people died.\n\nHe now faces Congressional hearings next week under growing pressure to rebuild confidence in Boeing and its workhorse jet, having had his chairman role removed earlier this month.\n\nThe earlier statement also ignited a feud between Boeing and Lion Air co-founder Rusdi Kirana who threatened to cancel all planes on order. Lion Air is one of Boeing\u2019s largest customers.\n\nThe airline eventually sent a formal protest to Boeing over what it saw as an impermissible effort to cast blame before the probe was complete, two people familiar with the matter said. Since then the dispute has abated, at least in public.", "description": "Boeing Co on Friday promised to act on safety recommendations for its 737 MAX aircraft made in a new report by Indonesian investigators on the deadly Lion Air crash a year ago.", "authors": ["Shubham Kalia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445032724&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0KN", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
