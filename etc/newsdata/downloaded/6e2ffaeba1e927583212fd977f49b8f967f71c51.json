Earlier this month, Erin Krakow, Pascale Hutton, Kavan Smith, and several members of the youthful cast of \u201cWhen Calls the Heart\u201d and the Hallmark Movies Now hit, \u201cWhen Hope Calls,\u201d came along for the fan moments and festivities at the HFR5 Convention in Vancouver.\n\nThe actress will share her spirit, friendliness, and warm glow with fans next month in Edison, New Jersey at ChristmasCon on Sunday, November 10, but for now, Erin Krakow wants Princess Meghan to know that her very human, motherly heart is understood, and a little sleep would be priceless. She conveyed those thoughts in social media messages over October 17-19, and her followers added caring thoughts of their own.\n\nBonds between moms\n\nOne of the components in \u201cWhen Calls the Heart\u201d that keeps the drama as \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d viewing even before the premiere of Season 7 is the unfailing support and bond of community that binds residents of Hope Valley through every situation of life. Erin Krakow is not yet a mother in her real-life, but her rapport with children comes quite naturally through her work as a nanny before landing the beloved Hallmark Channel role and her portrayal of Tanya Gabriel in the Lifetime series, \u201cArmy Wives.\u201d\n\nErin Krakow displayed only a simple broken heart symbol along with the hashtag, #WeLoveYouMeghan, attached to the post of an excerpt from her very personal interview, during which the Duchess of Sussex discusses the difficulty of being a newlywed and a new mother under a rabid public eye.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

It's a wonder that millions watch \u201cWhen Calls the Heart\u201d to revisit a kinder culture in the Northwest Territory.\n\nReady for snow, Christmas cheer, and a pillow\n\nMotherhood may be still in the distance for Erin Krakow, but the Philadelphia-born star is devoted to keeping her character of Elizabeth Thornton real and relatable as a single working mother.\n\nShe not only spend lots of off-camera time with Lincoln and Gunnar Taylor, who portray her precious son, Jack, on \u201cWhen Calls the Heart,\u201d but she also put considerable time into learning the perfect \u201cwaddle.\" The devoted educator was frequently caught catching a nap after being up at night with her sleepless son.\n\nWhile wrapping up the filming for the traditional Christmas Day movie feature before the series premiere in early 2020, Erin herself admitted to dreaming of being on her own pillow and preparing for dreamland in a post last week.\n\nStill looking lovely as ever, no dark circles were seen under her eyes.\n\n#t\ud83d\udecft because that\u2019s exactly where I want to be right now. \ud83d\ude34 pic.twitter.com/bJ0lFRGje3 \u2014 Erin Krakow (@erinkrakow) October 18, 2019\n\nFans won\u2019t have a long wait to see Erin Krakow in a new Christmas treat. \u201cSense, Sensibility & Snowmen\u201d is slated to air November 29 on Hallmark Movies & Mysteries as part of the \u201cMiracles of Christmas\u201d annual celebration.
