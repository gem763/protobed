Williams issued a plea for help after Twitter\u2019s legal team sent him a \u201chateful conduct\u201d warning prior to his White House visit.\n\nThe well-known supporter of President Trump told over 630,000 followers that he is \u201cpissed\u201d that his account was flagged right as he prepared to meet President Trump at the White House\u2019s \u201cYoung Black Leadership Summit.\u201d\n\n\u201cTWITTERS LEGAL TEAM CONTACTED ME ON THE DAY I GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE!\u201d he tweeted Friday. \u201cPeople want to take my account down because I said Schiff Should Resign, called out AOC & I support Pres @realDonaldTrump. I NEED YOUR HELP. Please RT & comment using.\u201d\n\nHis tweet and its embedded video were seen over 160,000 times in less than two hours.\n\n\u201cOK, I need everybody to listen and pay attention,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are coming after Trump supporters. 2020 is around the corner and they are trying to take down accounts that support President Donald J. Trump. They are trying to take down big accounts like mine that support President Trump. Twitter\u2019s legal team has contacted me to notify me that my account has been flagged for possible hate conduct because I made a video about how Adam Schiff should resign and how the Democrats should stop harassing President Donald J. Trump. So you mean to tell me \u2014 oh, I\u2019m pissed off \u2014 so you mean to tell me that it is hateful because I\u2019m a black man that supports President Donald J. Trump?\u201d\n\nMr. Williams said he wanted to speak personally with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about the legal team\u2019s notice and its timing.\n\n\u201cThis is outrageous,\u201d he continued. \u201cSeriously outrageous. And guess what? I go to the White House today! The day that I go to the White House is the day that they notify me that my account may be in possible violations of hateful conduct. \u2026 None of my conduct is hateful. I am a comedian, a conservative Trump-supporting comedian and they want to take me down because people have jumped on the Trump train after watching my content. They want to take people down who are getting people to walk away from the Democratic Party. That\u2019s what they are doing. They are coming after me. Supporting this president is not hateful.\u201d\n\nTwitter\u2019s legal notice said that even if flagged content does not violate its terms of service it may still \u201cwithhold content in the USA based on the laws of the USA.\u201d\n\nPLEASE LEAVE MY PAGE ALONE TWITTER. I have the right to call out Adam Schiff & AOC! I have the right to support @realDonaldTrump\n\n\n\nEveryone please help me protect my account RT & use the hashtag as much as possible.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 #ProtectTerrencekWilliams\n\n\ud83d\udc49 #ProtectTerrencekWilliams https://t.co/wN0YbTkiPh \u2014 Terrence K.
