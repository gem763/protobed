We're sold it and it's so entwined into our lives that we barely notice it.\n\nWhile doing Plastic Free July, we found that the hardest products to swap out were the beauty products and toiletries we used every day. We searched for a while for toilet rolls sold without the thin plastic wrapper, as well as\n\nBut there are plenty of brands and small companies that are changing that as the plastic-free movement grows.\n\nWe\u2019ve continued to incorporate these products into our routine over the past couple of months to give them a thorough testing.\n\nWe were amazed at some of the companies we found, that not only eliminated plastic from its packaging, but also went above and beyond by donating to charities that range from supporting people who don't have safe access to toilets to orangutan foundations, refusing to test on animals, being free of palm oil, supporting women's cooperatives and resuing products that would otherwise end up in landfill.\n\nHere are the best alternatives we found.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Each roll is three-ply and still quite soft. They are individually wrapped in a thin piece of kraft paper that keeps them dry, which is the most sustainable way to package them. We also love that it\u2019s a sign-up delivery service too, meaning you\u2019ll never have to awkwardly carry a bargain multipack home again. Thanks goodness.\n\nBuy now\n\nUpCircle chai soap bars: \u00a36.99, UpCircle Beauty\n\nWe\u2019ve gone full circle when it comes to what you use to wash in the shower, so bring out your soap dish and stop buying shower gel in single use plastic bottles. UpCircle is all about reusing, repurposing an re-loving, in short it uses natural ingredients that would otherwise end in the landfill in its products: think coffee grounds and chai tea spices. Everything is 100 per cent natural, free of palm oil and vegan, obviously. We love this chunky soap bar, which is actually a two-in-one product, as the repurposed chai spices act as a scrub on your skin too. We just hold the bar and rub over our skin and we come out feeling sparkly with noticeably soft skin, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nAxiology lipstick: \u00a325, Glow Organics\n\nThe brand takes its name from the word which means \"the philosophical study of value\", and clearly it has many values: calling itself 100 per cent evil free, and believing that make-up shouldn\u2019t only be safe for humans, but for animals and the environment too. Eac lipstick only has 10 ingredients (which it proudly lists on its site from organic coconut oil to candelilla wax), compared to other lipsticks which often even have lead in them. The lipsticks aren\u2019t tested on animals, are vegan, are free of palm oil and the brand donates to the orangutan foundations and other charities.\n\nThe packaging is completely recyclable: it comes in a recycled paper triangle packet from a women-run cooperative in Bali, and the outer bullet is made from aluminium and is completely recyclable. There\u2019s 30 shades, and we tested Bonafide, which we found to be wonderfully creamy and a great summery pinky/ orange hue.\n\nBuy now\n\nFace Halo make-up remover pads, pack of 3: \u00a318, Amazon\n\nIf taking your make-up off at the end of the day is something you hate doing, and you're fed up of using cotton pads that come in non-recyclable plastic bags and get through endless amounts of bottles of cleanser, or worse, packs of face wipes, these face pads from Face Halo solves all those problems. The large fluffy white pads \u2013 incredibly \u2013 only need water to remove make-up, so there\u2019s no chemicals, woo! And it's so quick and easy.\n\nYes, we were dubious too, but it works and takes off mascara sufficiently. We even used a cleanser afterwards to see if there was any stubborn make-up left behind, and there wasn\u2019t. We bent it in half to easily take off mascara, without rubbing delicate skin. These can be washed up to 200 times in the washing machine too. And once you\u2019re done with them, don't throw them away \u2013 you can send them back to Face Halo to be recycled.\n\nCurrently, the bags are not recyclable, but the brand is working on it, and as these pads last so long, you\u2019ll certainly be cutting down on waste. The bags are also designed to not need extra packaging in the post too.\n\nBuy now\n\nOHNE tampons: From \u00a35.80 for 24, OHNE\n\nOHNE tampons are organic, guaranteed by the Soil Association, are not bleached like most tampons and are free of pesticides. The wrapper, box, shipping bags and applicator of the applicator version are biodegradable. While the non-applicator tampons are wrapped in a thin layer of recyclable plastic, which it needs to prevent contamination, the company is working on finding a bioplastic. You can order mixed boxes of tampons to suit your periods and money from each box contributes to providing young women in Zambia with menstrual education through School Club Zambia, as well as new toilet blocks.\n\nBuy now\n\nBen & Anna natural papertude deodorant stick: \u00a37.16, Ben & Anna\n\nAs one of the only brands offering a plastic-free option for deodorants, this Germany-based company has designed its push-pop style cream stick, and it\u2019s a godsend. Coming in seven scents, we prefer the original one, \u201cpure\u201d. They are all made from natural ingredients like shea butter and soda, and aren\u2019t tested on animals. It\u2019s a smooth application and stops any odour from occurring. Once you\u2019ve finished, you can recycle the cardboard after washing it.\n\nBuy now\n\nTePe Good toothrbrush: \u00a32.75, Waitrose & Partners\n\nNow this might look like an ordinary single use toothbrush, but that it ain't. This is bio-based plastic that's made from sugarcane and caster oil. What's more the whole things is created with 100 per cent green energy in Sweden. This process also recirculates an estimated 95 per cent of the carbon dioxide emissions during its life cycle. It's an easy to use brush with a nice and small head so you can get right to the back of your gnashes. Available in regular soft, compact soft and mini extra soft. The plastic packaging is also made from 70 per cent recycled PET and the cardboard is made from FSC approved cardboard.\n\nZao pearly eye shadow: \u00a316, Zao Essence of Nature\n\nThis brand, founded by David Reccole, specialises in plastic-free makeup. Currently, its compact bronzing powders, eye shadows, eyebrow powders, eye primers, blushes and shine-up powders are all plastic free \u2013 while some items that come in tubes or use wands still use a little plastic, but come in bamboo packaging.\n\nThe eye shadows have refillable pots and use sustainable and biodegradable bamboo outer materials that clip back together with tiny magnets. We tested the golden sand eyeshadow that\u2019s 100 per cent plastic-free and very easy to apply. All the brand\u2019s products are non-toxic, natural, and cruelty-free too.\n\nBuy now\n\nLush shampoo bar: From \u00a36.60, Lush\n\nPaving the way in the zero-plastic toiletries market, and now offering 40 per cent of its range plastic-free, Lush launched its shampoo bars in 1988 and has 26 different fragrances to choose from. Our favourite is by far the blue seanik bar. After lathering the product up in your hands to apply, it leaves your hair clean, shiny and soft. If you\u2019re worried about keeping them dry and surfaces clean, you can buy a metal tin to keep them in for \u00a32.50 from Lush that will last for years.\n\nBuy now\n\nPaper-stemmed cotton buds: \u00a32.40, Its All About You\n\nThe plastic sticks that make up many cotton buds are one of the most commonly washed up things on British beaches after they\u2019re flushed down the toilet. Now many brands have switched to paper or bamboo alternatives thanks to the #switchthestick campaign in 2016. These bamboo buds come in a biodegradable pack and not a plastic case, they can be composted at home, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nEnvironmental bamboo toothbrush: \u00a32.80, Ethical Superstore\n\nDisposable plastic toothbrushes are a huge source of plastic waste. Swap yours out for a bamboo option that\u2019s sustainable and biodegradable. The bristles are made from BPA-free plastic, which is non-toxic. When you\u2019re done with it, remove the bristles and it can be decomposed at home.\n\nBuy now\n\nVerdict: Plastic-free toiletries and beauty products\n\nWho Gives A Crap toilet paper is such a great company: not only does it use no non-recyclable plastic that toilet roll usually comes in , but it donates money to charities that help build toilets around the world. We also love that it\u2019s a delivery and subscription service, too. The Ben & Anna plastic-free deodorant is also a top choice as it cuts out lots of plastic from your daily routine.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
