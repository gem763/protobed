If you don\u2019t consider Chappelle funny, you are wrong. If you are a comedian who does not see that he is the best we have, quit,\u201d Mr. Macdonald tweeted.\n\nReleased by Netflix on Aug. 26, \u201cSticks and Stones\u201d has caused a considerable amount of blowback in the weeks since for Mr. Chappelle, 46, who has come under fire from critics for telling jokes in the special mocking transgender people, Asians and sexual assault victims, among others. A review published in Vice said the comedian\u2019s \u201cmisogyny and transphobia\u201d made the special worth skipping, while another in Vanity Fair called it \u201cstale work.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately I just think it\u2019s someone who has been rich for a long time now and no longer has that many interesting things to say, because they\u2019re not really living in the same world you or I are living in, at this point,\u201d comedian Joel Kim Booster told WNYC\u2019s \u201cAll of It\u201d program last week.\n\n\u201cI think Chappelle used to have really interesting and prescient things to say about power structures and things like that, and I just don\u2019t think he\u2019s interested in dismantling that anymore. At least not from an interesting place, or at least not from beyond his own point of view \u2014 which is his right as a comic, I guess, but it felt a little bit, I don\u2019t know, old, when I watched it,\u201d said Mr. Booster.\n\nMr. Chappelle signed a deal with Netflix in 2016 to film a series of special for the streaming-service, with multiple outlets previously reporting that he would be paid $60 million for three exclusives. The first two were released in March 2017.\n\nMr. Macdonald, 59, worked for five seasons on \u201cSNL,\u201d including three spent anchoring the program\u2019s Weekend Update segment, prior to being fired in 1998. He co-starred in a movie with Mr. Chappelle, \u201cScrewed,\u201d released in 2000.\n\nHis tweet supportive of Mr. Chappelle was retweeted more than 7,000 times within 20 hours of being posted.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
