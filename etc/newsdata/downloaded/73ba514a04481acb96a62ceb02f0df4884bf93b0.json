Kupperman asked for the ruling to be made ahead of the showdown on Monday, The New York Times reports.\n\nKupperman, who has since left the White House, was set to be a key witness after he was subpoenaed by House Democrats.\n\nBut after the White House announced Friday that the president had invoked 'constitutional immunity' the former deputy national security adviser is said to need guidance on 'which branch's command should prevail'.\n\nThe suit, filed in federal court in Washington, states: 'Plaintiff obviously cannot satisfy the competing demands of both the legislative and executive branches, and he is aware of no controlling judicial authority definitively establishing which branch's command should prevail.'\n\nFormer deputy national security adviser Charles M. Kupperman filed a lawsuit Friday asking a judge to decide if he can testify to the impeachment inquiry on Monday after Trump invoked 'constitutional immunity' to stop him\n\nThe lawsuit filed Friday will raise questions on whether John Bolton (pictured) can give evidence too. Democrats believe both Kupperman and his former boss, pictured, who were both close advisers of Trump and longtime Republicans, could be key witnesses\n\nIt adds: 'Mr. Kupperman is faced with irreconcilable commands by the legislative and executive branches of the government and, accordingly, seeks a declaratory judgment from this court as to whether he is lawfully obliged to comply with a subpoena issued by the House defendants demanding his testimony \u2018pursuant to the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry,\u2019 or he is lawfully obliged to abide by the assertion of immunity from congressional process made by the president in connection with the testimony sought from plaintiff.'.\n\nKupperman's lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, also represents Bolton who has not yet been subpoenaed. But the lawsuit will raise questions on whether he too can give evidence.\n\nDemocrats are looking into whether Trump encouraged Ukraine to conduct investigations that could benefit him politically in 2020\n\nDemocrats believe both Kupperman and his former boss, who were both close advisers of Trump and longtime Republicans, could be key witnesses.\n\nThey are looking into whether Trump encouraged Ukraine to conduct investigations that could benefit him politically in 2020 and to address whether those requests were tied to conditions for giving Ukraine military aid and a White House meeting.\n\nBolton resigned on September 10 when Kupperman became acting national security adviser. The following day the president released $391 million in aid to Ukraine.\n\nTrump requested the probes on a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Kupperman may have been listening into the call because of his position.\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone is said to have told Kupperman not to comply with the subpoena after the president had invoked 'constitutional immunity'.\n\nThe lawsuit adds: 'The president, however, acting through the White House counsel, has asserted that plaintiff, as a close personal adviser to the president, is immune from congressional process, and has instructed plaintiff not to appear and testify in response to the House's subpoena.'\n\nThe head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, Steven A. Engel, has said previously: 'Congress may not constitutionally compel the president's senior advisers to testify about their official duties.'\n\nIn 2008 it was ruled that Harriet Miers, a former White House counsel under President George W. Bush, should not miss a hearing she had been subpoenaed for.\n\nFormer White House Counsel Don McGahn has defied his subpoena after the president\u2019s legal team issued the same 'constitutional immunity' advice. A lawsuit on the matter remains unresolved.", "description": "Charles Kupperman filed the lawsuit Friday.
