During his time at university he joined the Muslim Brotherhood, a pan-Arab movement that seeks to establish states based on Islamic law which was then - as now - banned in many states.\n\nBaghdadi gravitated towards the more extreme side of the Brotherhood in Baghdad, which was dominated by Salafis, Islamist hardliners dedicated to a strict interpretation of Islamic law and to jihad, the waging of war against rulers that they considered had betrayed the Muslim faith.\n\nCamp Bucca\n\nAfter the U.S. invasion to unseat Saddam Hussein in 2003, Baghdadi fell in with the Sunni militias that were formed in the chaos of post-war Iraq to fight the American occupation.\n\nHe was jailed at Camp Bucca in 2004 and, while inside, made a name for himself as a preacher and footballer in the prison yard - this time gaining the nickname of \u2018Maradona,\u201d according to a detailed profile of Baghdadi by Al Monitor.\n\nDuring his tine in Camp Bucca, he established ties with al-Qaeda in Iraq and many of the men who would go in to become leading figures in its offshoot, the Isalmic State of Iraq. In 2010, when the leaders of the group were killed in an air strike, Baghdadi became its leader.\n\nIn 2011, he expanded the group into Syria, changing its name to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. After the beginning of the war in Syria, and rise of jihadi groups that followed the revolution, ISIS exploited the power vaccuum to seize major towns and cities, including Raqqa.\n\nThen, in 2014, ISIS entered the world stage when it seized the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. In his only televised speech, from the pulpit of Mosul\u2019s Grand Mosque, Baghdadi announced the foundation of the caliphate, with himself as caliph. The group went on to seize swathes of northern Iraq and even at one point threaten the capital, Baghdad,\n\nAir strike\n\nRumours of Baghdadi\u2019s death had arisen as far back as 2015, when it was reported that he had been badly wounded in an air strike in al-Baaj, near Mosul, in Iraq. It was later reported that Baghdadi was so badly injured that he would \u201cnever lead the organisation\u201d again.\n\nAfter the air strike, Baghdadi moved from Mosul to Raqqa, in Syria, where he kept a low profile, travel secretly and avoided the public eye. He appeared only in audio messages to ISIS supporters, in 2015, 2016 and 2017, making sure to mention current events in order to quash rumours of his death. His final broadcast came in September 2019.\n\nDuring that time, ISIS\u2019s fortunes rise and fell in Syria and Iraq. The group was pushed out of Mosul and Raqqa in 2017. Eventually ISIS\u2019s final stronghold in the Syrian town of Baghouz was retaken in 2019, and many of its supporters - including many foreign nationals - are currently being held in refugee camps in northern Syria.\n\nHow Baghdadi planned to get to Turkey or where he would go when he got to the country is unclear, but the ISIS leader will have known at time was running out. Despite his reclusive nature , he was arguably the world\u2019s most wanted man, with $25 million U.S. bounty on his head.", "description": "Born Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Al-Badr, Baghdadi rose to lead the brutal militant group in Iraq and Syria.", "authors": ["Orlando Crowcroft"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/09/14/1000x563_cmsv2_abd78274-b7ff-5549-a7e3-7190f0216ae5-4260914.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
