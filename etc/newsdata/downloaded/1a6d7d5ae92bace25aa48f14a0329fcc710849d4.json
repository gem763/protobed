It\u2019s nice \u2013 and indeed often necessary \u2013 to get out a bit to other parts of the continent, to get the full picture.\n\nI\u2019m writing this from the train to Luxembourg, where I\u2019ll be filing stories from today. Boris Johnson is in town to meet Jean-Claude Juncker and the country\u2019s prime minister Xavier Bettel. We\u2019re hoping to pin them down on their plans for Brexit.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The train is slow and takes three hours, winding its way through the Ardennes at a relatively sedate pace. But personally, I love it: Belgian trains are very comfortable, and there\u2019s plenty of time to work on other stories or prepare for your trip \u2013 if you can tear yourself away from the scenery.\n\nOn a plane, you wouldn\u2019t be able to call your editor, quiz contacts, or file stories. You\u2019d be strapped in, and a working internet connection is rare. But a productive few hours, or even a whole day, is possible on rail.\n\nWherever possible I try to get the train to pursue stories in other European countries, instead of flying. Mostly because it\u2019s a better experience, but also with one eye on The Independent\u2019s carbon emissions. Greta Thunberg and the Flygskam movement have done a great job of popularising this kind of travel over the last year or so, but it\u2019s always seemed like common sense to me.\n\nThe longest trip I\u2019ve done for work was to Salzburg and back (11 hours by day train) for that crunch EU summit with Theresa May in September 2018 \u2013 a fantastic journey that I\u2019d do again in a heartbeat. I got plenty of work done; both legs were practically like a normal day at the office. Sleeper services have also been useful for some trips: I took an overnight train to cover a speech by David Davis in Vienna; a very time-efficient way of doing things.\n\nBrussels\u2019 central position in western Europe makes this all quite easy, but I\u2019d encourage everyone to explore our continent this way.\n\nYours,\n\nJon Stone\n\nEurope correspondent", "description": "You probably won\u2019t be too surprised to hear that as The Independent\u2019s Europe correspondent, I spend\u00a0a lot of my time covering Brexit.
