The two leaders have failed to make progress in talks on denuclearization and sanctions relief\n\nBefore the Singapore talks, North Korea had long said it would denuclearize only if the US withdraws its 28,500 troops from South Korea, ends military drills with the South and takes other steps to guarantee the North's security.\n\nSaturday's talks were the first between the sides since the second Trump-Kim summit in Vietnam in February collapsed due to squabbling over how much sanctions relief should be given to North Korea in return for dismantling its main nuclear complex.\n\nThe two leaders held a brief, impromptu meeting at the Korean border in late June and agreed to restart diplomacy.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said the chief North Korean negotiator's comments about Saturday's talks did 'not reflect the content or the spirit' of the 'good discussions' that took place over 8 \u00bd hours.\n\nShe said the US delegation 'previewed a number of new initiatives that would allow us to make progress in each of the four pillars' of a joint statement issued after Trump and Kim's first summit in Singapore in June 2018.\n\nOrtagus also said the US accepted an invitation from Sweden to return to Stockholm in two weeks to continue talks.\n\nBecause the US does not have official diplomatic relations with North Korea, Sweden has often acted as a bridge between Washington and Pyongyang.\n\nKim Myong Gil, the North Korean negotiator, said the North proposed a suspension of talks until December.\n\nPyongyang tested what it called a 'super-large' rocket on Wednesday just hours after it said it was willing to resume working-level talks with Washington\n\nHe said North Korea also made it clear that the two countries can discuss the North's next denuclearization steps if the United States 'sincerely responds' to previous measures taken by Pyongyang, including the suspension of nuclear and long-range missile tests and the closing of its underground nuclear testing site.\n\nNorth Korea has demanded the United States come up with mutually acceptable proposals to salvage the nuclear diplomacy by the end of this year.\n\nKim Myong Gil said whether North Korea will lift its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests is completely up to the United States.\n\n'The fate of the future (North Korea)-US dialogue depends on the US attitude, and the end of this year is its deadline,' the North Korean Foreign Ministry statement said.", "description": "After talks in Stockholm broke down on Saturday, the chief North Korean nuclear negotiator said the discussions broke down 'entirely because the US has not discarded its old stance and attitude'.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/16/19364076-0-image-a-19_1570375034185.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
