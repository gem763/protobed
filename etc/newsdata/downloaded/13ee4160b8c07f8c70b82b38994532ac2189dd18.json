Almost all those drones are flown by amateurs; there are just 663 Remote Piloted Aircraft Systems in the country, according to the 2018 State of the Drone Report.\n\nIt\u2019s not a legal requirement for hobby drone pilots to obtain licenses, but it can help to reduce the number of costly crashes. And as Business Insider South Africa discovered in 2018, many insurance companies are unwilling to cover these.\n\nUnskilled part-time pilots, the high cost of repairs, the equipment\u2019s relative fragility, the potential risk of injury and damage to property, and the complex legal framework surrounding the informal flying of drones, have lead many mainstream insurance companies to shut the door on policies - and the costs of repair, or liability, often rests solely with the hobby pilot.\n\n1,200 drone accidents in 2019 \u2013 so far \u2013 at one repair shop.\n\nAccording to Fixology, a drone repair company based in Cape Town, drones are falling out of the sky regularly.\n\nIn the first eight months of 2019, Fixology booked in around 1,200 damaged drones.\n\nThe company\u2019s Nathan Appel says as many as 75% of the accidents they see are due to pilot error.\n\nThis includes owners testing out their drones indoors without a stable GPS signal, and not doing a proper preflight check before take off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for hobbyists to forget to ensure propellers and batteries are properly fitted before flying off,\u201d says Appel.\n\nAlthough most hobby drones now come equipped with technology to avoid the most basic of accidents, amateur pilots often inadvertently override these, or fail to activate them correctly.\n\nOne key feature built into most good quality consumer drones is a return to home functionality, that returns the device to its starting point in the event of low battery, loss of signal, or other difficulties.\n\nBut even this isn\u2019t foolproof. Some drone pilots set the return GPS location to a moving object, such as a boat - which means that when the drone returns to home, the pilot has moved on.\n\n\u201cMany accidents happen because pilots don\u2019t wait for a full satellite signal on the drone before takeoff, resulting in no return to home location being logged on the device,\u201d says Appel.\n\nAnd many rookie crashes are due to battery issues.\n\n\u201cSome also fly a drone out with the wind, without taking into account the return time, given the force of the wind holding it back on the return home,\u201d says Appel. \u201cAnd some pilots simply forget to check their battery levels.\u201d\n\nA high volume of cellphone network towers and satellite dishes will confuse their drones, which is another leading cause of accidents that Appel sees at Fixology. And some inadvertently deactivate object avoidance sensors by flying their drones in sport mode - causing them to crash unexpectedly into fixed objects.\n\nAnd being in the Cape, Fixology repairs drones used for more than just photography. \u201cIn-experienced fishermen flying with bait droppers sometimes cause the line to be tangled in the propellers,\u201d says Appel, \u201ccausing the drone to crash in the ocean.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fixology the number of accidents on the very first flight has dropped in recent years, thanks to the increase in accident avoidance technology. But even so, they estimate that as many as 10% of users crash their drones fresh out of the box.\n\nNot all drone accidents are the fault of the pilot, though.\n\n\u201cManufacturing faults, electronic parts malfunctioning, and faulty batteries can cause the props to stop in mid-air,\u201d says Appel. \u201cAnd using a non-recommended smart device to fly the drone, and getting a bad feed, can also result in blank screens and crashing\u201d.\n\nWhen drones do fall out of the sky, repairs aren\u2019t cheap.\n\nThe parts that Fixology repairs the most - things like gimbals, sensors, propellers, legs and arms - can cost thousands to fix or replace. And if the crash is directly into the ocean or a body of water, you can write the drone off altogether.\n\nBasic repairs to gimbal ribbons, landing gear, and remotes on entry level drones like the DJI Mavic start at R1,500, says Appel. But if you manage to destroy the gimbal on your DJI Phantom - one of the most popular drones in South Africa - you\u2019ll be at least R14,500 out of pocket.\n\nMore insurers now cover drones \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t come cheap.\n\nInsuring drones in South Africa is difficult, in part because of the high rate of accidents, cost of repairs, and potential liability to third parties.\n\nBut according to Drone Covered\u2019s Ryno Du Toit, the uptake for insurance from hobby pilots has also been slow. Drone Covered is one of the few companies in South Africa to insure non-commercial pilots and hobbyists, both on the ground and inflight.\n\nGiven the expensive repairs, and potential liability, Du Toit is unsure why more drone hobbyists aren\u2019t taking up insurance, but he suspects because many fly so occasionally, and just for fun, they\u2019re willing to take the risk of not insuring.\n\nDrone Covered, like most insurers, are also particularly strict about claims - any breach of Civil Aviation Authority rules will lead to the claim being repudiated. And before any claim is processed, they will check the flight logs. Still, Du Toit says that about 10% of their current client base has logged claims, and of those, roughly 75% were successful.\n\nSome larger insurance companies are also starting to insure non-commercial drones, though somewhat reluctantly. Hollard and Santam Aviation now offer full and comprehensive cover for private and commercial operators. And AlexanderForbes has a similar policy - they\u2019ll cover the drone for loss and damage, though premiums go up significantly if this occurs while the drone is in use.\n\nMost larger insurance companies require that pilots first attain official licenses to fly, though. This process, which runs through the Civil Aviation Authority, is arduous - particularly for the occasional weekend warrior.\n\nAs a compromise, Drone Covered offers incentives to those hobby pilots who undergo private proficiency training - both online and in-person. They will halve excess, from 20% to 10%, and increase liability cover, from R500,000 to R2.5 million.\n\nBut drone insurance isn\u2019t cheap - it will likely cost around 12% of the retail cost of the drone.\n\nInsurance requirement or not, most experts recommend that users do some proficiency course, and are well versed in CAA laws. Flying a drone in South Africa is governed by several laws, and it\u2019s a hobby that can have severe legal consequences, including fines and possible jail time for those who break them.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Fixing a drone can be expensive, and so can insuring one, but avoiding a couple of dumb mistakes is relatively easy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6865/b23de3ac9d8a4b46976b50dc6fb17ebe.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
