So if you're in sales, that means you should be an expert in how to sell to women.\n\nBut over the years, I've found myself in situations with male salespeople that prove there's still a major disconnect. While this is certainly not true in every case, I find that I'm often left feeling disrespected, uncomfortable, or stereotyped, and, as a result, those men don't earn my trust or my business.\n\nIt's a common problem. I've seen it not only in my personal life, but throughout my career in financial services. Part of what I do is help brands \u2014 especially financial companies \u2014 connect with female audiences. A lot of that work focuses on identifying the subtext that brands unknowingly send and helping them evolve their messaging \u2014 knowledge I've gained over years of working one-on-one with women and hearing the frustrations they experience.\n\nBut it's not limited to my work in financial services and fintech. I pick up on this subtext in nearly every sales and business setting I'm in (most recently with three different companies when buying a water softener system for my home).\n\nSo for anyone who's selling something to women: Despite your good intentions, you may be making a few blunders you're not aware of. Here's what you need to know to close that communication gap \u2014 and hopefully, the sale.", "description": "For starters, don't focus on a woman's appearance, writes Natalie Taylor.
