For the current Prime Minister, it is his 6am walks with Dilyn the dog and running sessions on a treadmill left behind by Theresa May which give him the clarity of thought to try to deal with his multiple political dilemmas.\n\nAs summer gave way to the dawn chills of autumn, Mr Johnson abandoned his habit of wearing just a T-shirt and boxer shorts as he walked around the No 10 garden \u2013 in favour of the even more eccentric combination of swimming trunks and a hoodie.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s main political headache has remained intractably constant since he became Prime Minister in July: How to secure a deal with Brussels which could command the support of a majority of MPs.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s hero, Winston Churchill, dealt with the pressures of leading the war effort by sinking into a hot bath with a glass of Pol Roger champagne\n\nLast week\u2019s dilemma \u2013 whether to break the Brexit deadlock by pushing for a pre-Christmas General Election \u2013 came against the backdrop of starkly contrasting advice from two rival camps of advisers and Ministers.\n\nOn one side are the One Nation moderates who want him to delay a poll until the spring to concentrate on passing his deal through the Commons. On the other is a group led by chief aide Dominic Cummings \u2013 dubbed the Suicide Squad by opponents \u2013 who want to keep pushing for a snap poll in December.\n\nAccording to No 10 sources, Mr Johnson sits \u2018Buddah-like\u2019 as the \u2018robust exchanges\u2019 are conducted around him. One said: \u2018He listens to all sides, chipping in, \u201cGreat idea, what about that\u201d, and then waits to see if anyone comes back to counter it. If they do, he goes, \u201cOh gosh, yes, good point.\u201d Then he usually sides with whatever Dom said.\u2019\n\nThe aide added: \u2018It\u2019s not civil war. But these people are assertive characters, which is as it should be. There are obviously different views on how to get out of this. This is real roll-of-the-dice stuff. We are one bad move away from Corbyn having the nuclear codes so obviously these things have to be stress-tested\u2019.\n\nMr Cummings, along with other veterans of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign, has argued that a quick \u2018people versus Parliament\u2019 Election during the imminent delay to Brexit would create the perfect conditions for a healthy Tory majority.\n\nBut the One Nation group \u2013 led by Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith and longstanding adviser Sir Eddie Lister \u2013 would rather delay an Election and let the deal go through the Commons even if it is \u2018wrecked\u2019 by pro-Remain amendments such as forcing the UK to stay in a customs union. They argue that as no Parliament can bind its successor, a future Tory Government could use its majority from the next Election to unpick any wrecking amendments.\n\nA leading One Nation adviser claims the Suicide Squad has forced Mr Johnson to go against his \u2018gut instinct\u2019 to delay the Election until at least March \u2013 although Labour\u2019s expected refusal to vote on tomorrow\u2019s motion to trigger a poll means he is struggling to even control that decision.\n\nSome colleagues say that making high-stakes decisions, under the long shadow of Theresa May\u2019s 2017 Election fiasco, has left the normally ebullient Prime Minister seeming \u2018distracted and subdued\u2019. But aides who worked with Mr Johnson at City Hall counter: \u2018As long as he is still laughing, he is OK. When the laughter stops, that is when you need to worry.\n\nFor the current Prime Minister, it is his 6am walks with Dilyn the dog and running sessions on a treadmill left behind by Theresa May which give him the clarity of thought to try to deal with his multiple political dilemmas\n\n\u2018There is still laughter from Boris, but not as much as there was. He knows the enormity of the task he is facing.\u2019\n\nAnother aide said: \u2018Tigger has definitely lost his bounce... he is totally shattered after not having a proper day off since May.\u2019 But Mr Johnson insists to friends he\u2019s \u2018full of beans\u2019 and keen to get on the campaign trail to \u2018stick it to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019. Yesterday he was said to be in \u2018particularly high spirits\u2019 as he watched England defeat the All Blacks in the Rugby World Cup semi-final.\n\nMr Johnson has been warned by the One Nation moderates of the risk that if he holds a winter Election, Labour could take advantage of the expected flu crisis \u2013 the virus is sweeping Australia and heading for the UK \u2013 to savage the Government\u2019s stewardship of the NHS. Pictures of homeless people \u2018freezing on the streets\u2019 could also be used to portray the party as \u2018callous\u2019.\n\nMr Johnson is understood to be particularly troubled by a lack of private data pointing to a likely Tory win in a December Election.\n\nA One Nation source said: \u2018There is not one piece of evidence to say where these extra seats will come from if we have a Christmas Election. Not one.\n\n\u2018This is entirely the wrong strategy. Boris has been captured by Cummings. What we want is Boris the Statesman. He should be calmly but resolutely getting the deal through Parliament. This is the battle for Boris\u2019s political soul \u2013 just as he wrote two newspaper articles, one backing Remain and one backing Leave, and only made his mind up at the last minute. That\u2019s how he is.\u2019\n\nHowever, members of the Suicide Squad insist the Withdrawal Bill has to be \u2018parked\u2019 now to stop Remainers from wrecking it. One said: \u2018Parliament will try to f*** up the Withdrawal Bill by amending it to include a customs union or second referendum. There may even be a move to dust off Theresa May\u2019s deal and put that in.\u2019\n\nOn Friday, Dominic Cummings told a meeting that the current crop of MPs was \u2018the worst parliament in 400 years\u2019 and insisted that the Government should not \u2018be sucked into the morass of this zombie parliament\u2019\n\nThe source suggested those attempts would have to come before the end of the week while John Bercow, who is due to quit as Speaker, was still in the Chair.\n\nOn Friday, Cummings told a meeting that the current crop of MPs was \u2018the worst parliament in 400 years\u2019 and insisted that the Government should not \u2018be sucked into the morass of this zombie parliament\u2019.\n\nDespite Mr Johnson being in \u2018constant text contact\u2019 with Emmanuel Macron, hopes were last night fading that the French President would be able to force through just a short Brexit extension to the end of November.\n\nNo 10 hoped this would focus the minds of MPs back to a straight \u2018Deal versus No Deal\u2019 choice to scare them into passing the motion. \u2018Even if we get a month, the Remainers will just make us extend again,\u2019 said a Suicide Squad member. That is why we need an Election ASAP.\u2019\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s equanimity has also been tested by the fate of the 21 rebel Tory MPs who lost the whip after voting to block a No Deal Brexit. Up to 50 Tory MPs have made clear they will not vote for an Election until assurances have been given the 21 will be allowed back into the party.\n\nThere is also anger at Labour\u2019s game-playing \u2013 which Mr Johnson lays at the door of Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer, who No 10 believes is putting his own leadership ambitions before anything else.\n\nOne joke in Whitehall runs: \u2018Why is Jeremy called LINO? He is leader in name only \u2013 and people walk all over him.\u2019\n\nA friend of the Prime Minister said: \u2018He is frustrated by Labour\u2019s lack of direction and inability to make a decision. Boris is appalled by just how weak Corbyn is. He clearly wants the Election but is being held hostage by his own party, mainly Keir. Labour\u2019s got to come clean. Are they saying there must be no No Deal by January 31 or no No Deal ever? If it\u2019s the latter, it basically means they are in favour of revoking Article 50.\u2019\n\nBut the PM is at pains not to display his concerns. Addressing Tory peers in Parliament\u2019s Moses Room last Wednesday, he compared himself to the biblical hero, concluding with a cry to \u2018Let my people go!\u2019\n\nThroughout the drama, his girlfriend Carrie Symonds is said to have given \u2018rock-solid support\u2019. A source said: \u2018Every evening he makes a point of going through everything in his day with her and she keeps him feeling upbeat.\u2019\n\nMr Johnson has also stuck to his \u2018do or dry\u2019 pledge to give up booze until the UK is out of the EU, although some friends think he might benefit from \u2018a glass or two\u2019 to wind down.\n\nTime to bring out the Pol Roger?", "description": "Boris\u00a0Johnson's hero, Winston Churchill, dealt with the pressures of leading the war effort by sinking into a hot bath with a glass of Pol Roger champagne.", "authors": ["Glen Owen For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/01/20230556-0-image-a-8_1572135218878.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
