Please don't edit your photos. You have lost loads of weight. Do not need to make out you have lost more.'\n\nFilming: Gemma was seen wearing leather leggings and a Gucci-inspired jumper while filming The Only Way Is Essex on Wednesday\n\nDenied: Stylish Lucas Armitage said he edited the image but did not change Gemma's shape\n\nOthers said it was 'obvious Gemma is deceiving her fans by airbrushing her pictures' and another said 'weight loss of filter'.\n\nHowever stylish Lucas Armitage, who said he took the picture and did the edit, said that he had not changed Gemma's shape in the picture.\n\nGemma's manager has been contacted for comment by MailOnline.\n\nThe TV personality recently revealed that she hasn't stopped eating since she reportedly called 999 over fears her on-off boyfriend James Argent had overdosed.\n\nThe star admitted she was feeling stressed but vowed to bounce back and return to the gym.\n\nAirbrushed?

I\u2019ve had a lot of stress and I\u2019ve not been to the gym in two weeks, I\u2019ve been unwell all weekend with a chest infection.\n\n'When I come back, I will get back on it, I always come out on top. 'My life always goes a bit t*ts-up but I carry on, I\u2019ve got lots of projects on the table, so it\u2019s exciting.'\n\nBack in April Gemma was accused of Photoshopping images to market her clothing range.\n\nOn a mission: Gemma, pictured last Thursday, has already dropped three stone in weight\n\nIt was revealed that she could be facing legal action after her head was placed on a model's digitally-enlarged body, in order to promote her clothing collection and put online, leaving model Katie Green, 30, 'furious'.\n\nA day later, The Sun report a second model, Kate Louise Smith, 37, had come forward after reportedly being used for the same purpose, as she said: 'Rather than being mortified, I\u2019m just insulted. It\u2019s very intrusive and it\u2019s an odd thing to do.'\n\nAccording to the Daily Star, model Katie was furious to discover the poorly Photoshopped images and has sought legal advice.\n\nYet a spokesperson for Gemma told MailOnline at the time: 'The images were used in good faith by Gemma. An external firm assured her that they owned the copyright and had commissioned the shoots.'", "description": "Gemma Collins, 38, shared a snap of herself in a snake-print co-ord on Thursday but some fans claimed it had been edited, saying the: 'Skirting board is wonky behind legs and shadow doesn't look right.'", "authors": ["Bryony Jewell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/23/20200438-0-image-a-7_1572042590552.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
