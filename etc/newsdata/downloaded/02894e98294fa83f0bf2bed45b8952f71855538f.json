Jack Guez/AFP via Getty Images EU condemns \u2018deplorable\u2019 vandalism at Israeli embassy Right-wing activist claims responsibility.\n\nThe EU condemned as \"deplorable\" messages spray-painted in its embassy in Israel on Sunday, for which a right-wing, anti-immigration activist has claimed responsibility.\n\nA photo posted by Ambassador Emanuele Giaufret on Twitter shows one message spray-painted in red says \"German money kill Jews,\" while another says \"EU get out.\" Giaufret called the attack \"deplorable\" and \"threatening.\"\n\nA far-right, anti-asylum seeker activist, Sheffi Paz, claimed responsibility and turned herself in to police, according to Haaretz. A video shared by Israeli journalists on Twitter shows Paz spray-painting one of the messages while another woman tapes a sign on the wall saying \"STOP PAYING THE KILLERS OF OUR CHILDREN.\"\n\nPaz also reads from a statement in the video, saying \"stop subsidizing terrorists, stop financing illegal immigration or get out of Israel.\"\n\nIsraeli media identified the other woman as Meirav Hajaj, a woman whose daughter was killed in a terrorist attack while serving as a soldier. Paz also tweeted a photo of herself with Hajaj on Sunday, saying \"the EU is funding our child killers and infiltrators' associations. It's time for them to stop.\"\n\nIsrael is in full campaign mode ahead of a legislative election on Tuesday. Ayelet Shaked, chairwoman of the right-wing alliance Yamina, had previously announced a deal with Paz, agreeing to push for tougher legislation on migration, according to Haaretz.\n\nIsrael's foreign minister, Israel Katz, announced in a tweet that the country's police force is investigating the vandalism.\n\n\"I am appalled by and condemn the disgraceful vandalism of the EU Mission in Israel. Israel is committed to maintaining the security of all diplomatic missions,\" Katz wrote.\n\nToday the lobby of the EU Delegation was vandalized with threatening slogans on the walls. No one of my colleagues was in the office as we are closed on Sunday. This incident is deplorable and has to be condemned. We will continue to do our job. pic.twitter.com/BfQZW3z2Z1 \u2014 Emanuele Giaufret (@EGiaufretEU) September 15, 2019\n\nA spokeswoman for the EU's foreign affairs branch, Maja Kocijan\u010di\u010d, also condemned the spray-painting attack as a \"deplorable act of vandalism.\"\n\nThe U.N.'s special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay Mladenov from Bulgaria, tweeted: \"Such incitement should not be permissible or acceptable by any standard and must be condemned by all. I stand in solidarity with our #EU colleagues. No diplomatic representation should be harassed in such a way.
