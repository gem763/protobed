Guests will be able to come inside the park starting at 6 a.m., three hours before the normal opening time, under a promotion announced in May. Also, Disney has announced discounted ticket prices for guests who wait until noon to enter.\n\nFoxBusiness.com reached out to Disney for comment and is awaiting a reply.", "description": "Disneyland is lifting restrictions on park attendance to boost new Star Wars land in Florida.", "authors": ["Mike Cherico"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/01/0/0/Star-Wars-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
