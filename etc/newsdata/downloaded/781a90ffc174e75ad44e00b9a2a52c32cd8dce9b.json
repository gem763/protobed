Joaquin Phoenix starrer Joker has left people terrified across the globe. So much so, that people are walking out of the theatres and asking for the movie to be banned.\n\nTwitter\n\nA lot of people have been tweeting their discontentment with the content of Joker. According to them, the Tod Phillips directorial glorifies violence and encourages people to sympathise with a villainous character.\n\nI\u2019m watching Joker with my brother and sister in law but I needed to find an excuse to walk out for a second cuz this movie has made me the most uncomfortable I\u2019ve ever been at a theater in years \u2014 \ud83e\udd87 #1 susie fan \ud83e\udd87 (@masterbunne) October 4, 2019\n\nAmid all this, a man was found spitting at the patrons and cheering loudly during a screening of the movie at Times Square. Soon, he was kicked out of the theatre.\n\n\u201cThis is the guy who spent our entire screening of JOKER in NYC spitting at people and clapping whenever Joker killed somebody. Security escorted him out after a third of the audience fled the theater out of fear that he\u2019d start hurting people,\u201d tweeted a witness at the AMC Empire 25 theatre.\n\nDon't Miss 514 SHARES 16.1 K SHARES 109 SHARES 696 SHARES 113 SHARES\n\nThis is the guy who spent our entire screening of JOKER in NYC spitting at people and clapping whenever Joker killed somebody.

Dude sat next to me. I saw him pour a full bottle of tequila into his slushee b4 the movie started. When he stumbled away wasted, I thought he had left. But I guess he just sat somewhere else and started his clapping. Shit was scary - like a 4-D movie experience,\u201d he wrote.\n\nI was there. Dude sat next to me.

Some people are fearing that Joker could inspire another incident like 2012 Aurora, Colorado theatre shooting, where a gunman called James Holmes killed 12 people at the opening weekend of The Dark Night Rises, a Batman film. He had identified himself as the Joker when he was arrested. He is currently serving 12 life sentences.\n\nWith that, the use of Masks and face paints has also been banned at the theatres.", "description": "A man was found spitting at the patrons and cheering loudly during a screening of Joker near Times Square.
