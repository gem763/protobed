Fullback Telusa Veainu skipped in to dive on a chip through after the final gong to seal victory.\n\nU.S. flanker Tony Lamborn's score up against the post with three minutes to go closed the gap to five points and made it interesting. Tonga went back down the other end and Veainu sealed it.\n\nThe Tongans leave Japan with a win and avoid a sixth straight loss at Rugby World Cups, which would have been a Tonga record.\n\nThe U.S. didn't avoid a 10th straight defeat, which equals its worst run at the Rugby World Cup.\n\nBefore kickoff, the U.S. and Tongan players stood in silence with heads bowed in a moment's silence for those affected by Typhoon Hagibis. The powerful typhoon ripped through parts of Japan's eastern Pacific coast on Saturday, bringing damaging winds, torrential rain and flooding, leaving at least 19 people dead and more than a dozen missing.\n\nTonga should have won by more in Osaka and left at least five tries out there at Hanazono Rugby Stadium, four of them missed in the first half.\n\nThey got four tries anyway through loosehead prop Sigfried Fisi'ihoi, centers Malietoa Hingano and Piutau, and fullback Veainu.\n\nThe U.S. led 12-7 at halftime through a quick double by replacement back Mike Te'o despite conceding twice as many meters as the Tongans and missing 31 tackles in the first 40.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
