(BMY) and Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos. (EL) , which were both mentioned on Friday's \"Mad Money.\" BMY has been rallying nicely, but EL has been correcting lower since early September, which makes us wonder if Thursday's numbers can spark a rally. Let's see what's up with EL on the charts.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of EL, below, we see that prices are below the still-rising 50-day moving average line. Prices have filled part of an upside gap from August, and EL is still above the rising 200-day line. Even though EL has corrected about $20, the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line only shows a little bit of weakness over the past two months. This suggests that prices have fallen of their own weight, rather than from aggressive selling.\n\nThe 12-day price momentum study in the bottom panel shows higher lows from August to September to October. The pace of the price declines is slowing, despite prices moving lower. This is a bullish divergence between the price action and our indicator. A bullish divergence can sometimes foreshadow a price reversal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of EL, below, we can see a mixed picture. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has leveled off in recent weeks. This is not a real negative development, but it needs to be watched. The 12-week price momentum study shows that the rate of acceleration in price has slowed from April to now. This is a bearish divergence, but it does not necessarily mean that the rally is over.\n\nIn this weekly close-only Point and Figure chart of EL, below, we can see a potential long-term price target of $271 being projected.\n\nBottom line strategy: The price of EL has corrected lower ahead of earnings. If earnings and/or guidance is better than expected, we should see EL resume its uptrend.", "description": "The price of EL has corrected lower, and if its quarterly report or guidance is better than expected, we should the uptrend resume....BMY", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "If Est\u00e9e Lauder Beats On Earnings", "Expect Rally Ahead", "The Price Of El Has Corrected Lower", "If Its Quarterly Report Or Guidance Is Better Than Expected", "We Should The Uptrend Resume.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/e9dca16b-bf0d-11e7-bc3b-230fb10dbe9f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
