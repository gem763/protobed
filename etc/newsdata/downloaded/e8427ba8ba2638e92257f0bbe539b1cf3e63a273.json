The company is racing rivals including IBM Corp (IBM.N) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to be the first to commercialize the technology and sell it through its cloud computing business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that when people start using this and looking at performance stability and cloud interface, they\u2019ll get really excited about what we have to offer at Google,\u201d John Martinis, the company\u2019s chief scientist for quantum hardware, told reporters.\n\nThe breakthrough was described in a paper here published in science journal Nature. It followed weeks of controversy since a draft leaked over whether Google's claim of \"quantum supremacy\" was valid.\n\nIBM said a supercomputer employing a different set-up could solve the same challenge in under three days, while chipmaker Intel (INTC.O) said \u201cquantum practicality\u201d remained years away.\n\nGoogle defended its position, but did not dispute rivals\u2019 contentions. It has manufactured a handful of chips with 54 \u2018qubits\u2019, vastly more powerful than the standard 64-bit chip in many consumer devices. However, for the technology to be useful to customers it would need to make chips with thousands of qubits.\n\nMartinis said Google sees \u201ca pathway\u201d to a computer with 1,000 qubits and expressed confidence that it had a reliable process to make its new chip, dubbed Sycamore.\n\nThe U.S. and Chinese governments have led in the burgeoning quantum technology field, pledging billions of dollars in funding to corporate and state researchers to fast-track quantum development and mitigate possible issues, including the tech\u2019s expected ability to break digital encryption.\n\nGoogle has been among the beneficiaries of the American support. \u201cThe United States has taken a great leap forward in quantum computing,\u201d said U.S. chief technology officer Michael Kratsios on Wednesday.\n\nLONG-HELD DREAM\n\nFor decades, computer scientists have sought to harness quantum physics, laws governing the behaviour of particles that are smaller than atoms and can simultaneously exist in different states.\n\nA handout picture from October 2019 shows Sundar Pichai with one of Google's Quantum Computers in the Santa Barbara lab, California, U.S. Picture taken in October 2019.

This superposition property multiplies exponentially as qubits become entangled with each other, meaning the more qubits connected, the vastly more powerful a quantum computer becomes.\n\nBut there is a catch: Quantum researchers need to cool qubits to about absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius or -460 degrees Fahrenheit) to limit vibration - or \u201cnoise\u201d - that causes errors in calculations. It is in this challenging task that Google, which has designed much of its own electronics and used liquid helium for cooling, has made significant progress.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai compared the achievement to building the first rocket to leave Earth\u2019s atmosphere and touch the edge of space, an advance that brought interplanetary travel into the realm of the possible.\n\n\"For those of us working in science and technology, it's the 'hello world' moment we've been waiting for - the most meaningful milestone to date in the quest to make quantum computing a reality,\" Pichai wrote in a blog here\n\nSycamore, measuring about 10 mm (0.39 inch) across, is made using aluminium and indium parts sandwiched between two silicon wafers. In their experiment this year, the researchers were able to get 53 of Sycamore\u2019s qubits to interact in a quantum state.\n\nThey then had the quantum computer detect patterns in a series of seemingly random numbers, and it succeeded in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. They estimated that the same problem would take 10,000 years for a Summit supercomputer - the most powerful in the world today - to solve.\n\nHOLD ON A QUBIT\n\nWhile the peer-reviewed research has drawn plaudits, with MIT\u2019s William D. Oliver comparing it to the Wright brothers\u2019 first flights, skeptics say Google is over-selling its achievement.\n\nIBM said a supercomputer with additional disk storage can solve the random number problem in at most 2-1/2 days and with greater accuracy. It also said Google risked misleading the public by implying the new-style computers would replace existing ones.\n\n\"Quantum computers will never reign 'supreme' over classical computers, but will rather work in concert with them, since each have their unique strengths,\" Dario Gil, director of research at IBM, wrote in a blog here\n\nTorsten Siebert, manager of the quantum computing research program at Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer Society, agreed that \u201cprogress was likely to be achieved through such hybrid combinations.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nResearchers also have expressed concern about quantum computers being used, for example, to unseal secure data and passwords or enable new forms of surveillance.\n\nBut before quantum computers can break codes, security experts have plenty of time to adapt, Martinis said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident we\u2019ll all stay safe and secure in the future,\u201d he said.", "description": "Alphabet Inc's Google said on Wednesday it had achieved a breakthrough in computing research by using a quantum computer to solve in minutes a complex problem that would take today's most powerful supercomputer thousands of years to crack.", "authors": ["Douglas Busvine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444136620&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1AW", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
