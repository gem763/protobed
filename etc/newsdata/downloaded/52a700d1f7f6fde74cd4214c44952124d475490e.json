(Image: Games Workshop)\n\nThe grimdark future of the 41st millennium has a new master in the realm of comic books. Not a daemonspawn of chaos, not the husk of a long-dying emperor sustained by untold human sacrifice, just... well, technically Disney?\n\nTuesday, Games Workshop made the surprise announcement that it had handed over the comic book rights to its tabletop gaming worlds \u2014 both the fantasy-set Warhammer: Age of Sigmar and the futuristic dystopia of Warhammer 40,000 \u2014 to Marvel Comics. Details for now about what\u2019s planned for the publisher\u2019s take on Games Workshop\u2019s worlds are scant, other than the fact the first comics will be arriving some time in Autumn 2020.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Warhammer has headed to the pages of comics, of course \u2014 most recently Titan held the rights to publish comics under the licence, producing a series based on Warhammer 40K, supplementary games like Blood Bowl and more in recent years.\n\nAs much as it is an interesting move for Games Workshop \u2014 it\u2019s part of a recent push that has seen them do everything from collaborate with Bandai and Funko to make Warhammer action figures, making an animated series, and even starting to produce a TV series set in the shadows of 40K\u2019s sinister Inquisition \u2014 it\u2019s an even more interesting move for Marvel.\n\nAlthough its cavalcade of superheroes allows it to tell a depth of stories in myriad genres, there isn\u2019t really anything at the publisher quite like the absurd, satirical, over-the-top grimdarkness of either form of Warhammer.\n\nThe swords-and-sorcery-and-so-little-clothing epic fantasy of Conan \u2014 another recently re-acquired licence for the publisher \u2014 is perhaps the closest it has right now to the medieval fantasy of Age of Sigmar, but there\u2019s nothing really as a parallel to 40K. Sure, there\u2019s Star Wars, but the galaxy far, far away, as ridiculous as it can be, is not quite the same sort of sci-fi tone that 40K dabbles in. The space fascists are ostensibly the good guys in 40K, for starters.\n\nBut it\u2019s also interesting because Warhammer itself, while having grown in popularity in recent years stateside, isn\u2019t exactly a cultural force in Marvel\u2019s homeland in the way it is back in its ancestral home of the UK. If Marvel\u2019s comics can elevate the joyously badass bonkersness of the worlds of Warhammer to a new audience, that\u2019s a good thing for Warhammer \u2014 a world that exists beyond its tabletop form and needs new blood in its fandom to thrive.\n\nAfter all, the cost of a comic book or a trade paperback collection is a lot lower as a cost of entry than a box of miniatures (or six). We\u2019ll bring you more on Marvel\u2019s plans for Warhammer as and when we learn them.", "description": "The grimdark future of the 41st millennium has a new master in the realm of comic books.
