He published his annual summer reading list, visited Dairy Queen with his friend and colleague Warren Buffett, and continued tweeting about global health concerns.\n\nGates also had some unusually bad press this summer. The New Yorker published emails from the MIT Media Lab suggesting that Gates was \"directed\" by the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to donate $2 million to the institution (Gates' representative has pushed back on that characterization), and activists have organized protests and petitions against the Gates Foundation's decision to give Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a humanitarian award.\n\nStill, a coming Netflix documentary about his life might put him back in the news for more positive reasons.\n\nHere's everything Bill Gates was up to this summer.", "description": "Bill Gates kept a low profile this summer aside from reports on ties to Jeffrey Epstein and criticism of the Gates Foundation's humanitarian award.", "authors": ["Mary Meisenzahl"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8388662e22af2270100396-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
