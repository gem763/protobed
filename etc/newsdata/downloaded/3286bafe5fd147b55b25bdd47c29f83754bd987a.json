The fact there is such universal reluctance speaks volumes. House Of Fraser has been in disarray all along.\n\n\u2018Given the size of his business, it shows there\u2019s chaos and the shareholders are the main people who are losing out.\u2019\n\nAshley \u2013 who also owns struggling Premier League side Newcastle United \u2013 has said he wants to take some of the House Of Fraser stores upmarket, converting them into Frasers, which would be more akin to his Flannels designer clothing chain.\n\nThe Department for Business was contacted for comment.", "description": "In a thundering statement, the Sports Direct boss said he was renewing leases and investing in the department store chain as he battles to revive its fortunes having bought it out of administration.", "authors": ["Tom Witherow For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
