The overcontribution tax is calculated at one per cent per month, multiplied by the overcontribution amount for each month you\u2019re over the limit. In addition, you are required to report the overcontribution on a special return, the \u201cRC243 Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return,\u201d which is due by June 30 following the year of overcontribution.\n\nIf you\u2019re late filing that return, the penalty is five per cent of the balance owing (i.e. the overcontribution tax) plus an additional one per cent for each full month that the return is late, to a maximum of 12 months. If you were charged a late-filing penalty on a return for any of the three previous tax years, your penalty doubles to 10 per cent, plus two per cent for each month up to a maximum of 20 months. In addition, non-deductible arrears interest, compounded daily at the current rate of six per cent, is charged from July 1 following the year overcontribution.\n\nWhile it used to be the CRA\u2019s practice to automatically assess the TFSA overcontribution tax, that changed in 2016. Since then, in response to numerous innocent overcontribution errors, the CRA\u2019s policy changed and it now will send a warning letter to a first-time overcontributor and only assess the overcontribution tax if they do not remove the excess contribution from their TFSA. After the first violation, however, taxpayers are assessed the overcontribution tax without notice.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what happened in the most recent TFSA overcontribution case to find its way to Tax Court last month. The case involved a taxpayer who inadvertently contributed $40,000 to his TFSA in 2016. The taxpayer was hit with a $2,370 overcontribution tax, a penalty of $118 for failure to file the special TFSA return, along with arrears interest of $4.\n\nAt the hearing, the taxpayer described the \u201cinadvertent deposit of $40,000 to his TFSA as a simple case of human error,\u201d which the judge acknowledged was \u201can accurate characterization of the unusual facts of this case.\u201d\n\nThe taxpayer owned a roofing company in Timmins, Ont., which was busy during the summer and inactive during the winter. The taxpayer testified that his father \u201ctakes care of all the numbers,\u201d acted as bookkeeper for his son\u2019s roofing business and administered everything associated with the company, including financial matters. Indeed, the taxpayer\u2019s father was his son\u2019s authorized representative in dealing with the CRA and represented his son at the hearing.\n\nWhen customers paid the roofing company, the funds were deposited to the company\u2019s bank account by the taxpayer\u2019s father. In 2016, a management fee was paid via a cheque issued by the corporation to the taxpayer which he \u201cwas supposed to deposit\u2026 into (his) chequing account.\u201d\n\nBut, because the taxpayer worked during the days throughout the summer, he made the deposit at night. According to the testimony, on the night of July 21, 2016, the taxpayer went to a bank machine to deposit the cheque to his chequing account but instead, he inadvertently deposited it into his TFSA.\n\nThe taxpayer was adamant that this was an accident, saying: \u201cNobody deposits 40 grand into a (TFSA) \u2014 I know the rules. I had been warned the year before about an overcontribution. So I didn\u2019t want to do that mistake again.\u201d Apparently, the prior year the taxpayer also overcontributed to his TFSA to the tune of $5,000. He was sent a warning letter from the CRA with respect to the excess TFSA amount at the end of 2015. He withdrew the excess immediately upon receipt of that letter.\n\nThe error remained undetected for many months as there was enough money in the taxpayer\u2019s chequing account to fund the cheques he wrote and no cheques bounced after July 21, 2016. Thus, he had \u201cno reason to believe that the $40,000 cheque had not been deposited to his chequing account.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it wasn\u2019t until June 2017 that the error first came to light when the taxpayer\u2019s father spoke to a CRA official about a tax matter relating to the roofing company. After that discussion, the CRA official mentioned that his son had overcontributed to his TFSA by $39,500. The CRA official then told the taxpayer\u2019s father that a withdrawal of $29,000 would make the TFSA compliant so the taxpayer withdrew $29,000 from his TFSA that same day.\n\nUnder the Income Tax Act, the CRA has the power to waive or cancel the overcontribution tax if it can be established that the tax arose \u201cas a consequence of a reasonable error\u201d and the overcontribution is withdrawn from the TFSA \u201cwithout delay.\u201d\n\nIf there ever was a case of \u201creasonable error,\u201d this sounds like just that case. Unfortunately, however, the Tax Court judge was unable to cancel the overcontribution tax as that can only be done at the CRA\u2019s discretion. That being said, the judge urged the CRA to consider exercising its discretion to cancel the overcontribution tax. \u201cSuch cancellation would find ample support on the extraordinary facts of this case,\u201d the judge said.\n\nLet\u2019s hope the CRA does the right thing.\n\nJamie.Golombek@cibc.com\n\nJamie Golombek, CPA, CA, CFP, CLU, TEP is the Managing Director, Tax & Estate Planning with CIBC Financial Planning & Advice Group in Toronto.", "description": "Jamie Golombek: CRA has power to waive overcontribution tax if it can be established that the tax arose 'as a consequence of a reasonable error'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/money-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
