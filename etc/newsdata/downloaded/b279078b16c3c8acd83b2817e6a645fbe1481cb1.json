But he stopped in to observe for about 15 minutes before heading to what he saw as the main event, a meeting on protecting religious freedom.\n\nTrump said it was an \u201curgent moral duty\u201d for world leaders to stop crimes against faith, release prisoners of conscience and repeal laws restricting religious liberty.\n\n\u201cApproximately 80% of the world\u2019s population live in countries where religious liberty is threatened, restricted or even banned,\u201d Trump said, adding that when he first heard the statistic, he didn\u2019t believe it and asked for verification.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

His administration has hosted annual meetings on the topic in Washington, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced during this year\u2019s event that he would create an international alliance dedicated to the issue.\n\nUnderscoring the importance of Trump\u2019s action on the issue to evangelical voters who are critical to his 2020 reelection bid, one prominent evangelical backer Dallas-based pastor Robert Jeffress lauded Trump for focusing on religious freedom instead of climate change.\n\n\u201cWhat president in history would have the guts to do what President Trump is doing?\u201d Jeffress, who was set to be in the audience for Trump\u2019s speech, said on Fox News. \u201cAnd it\u2019s this kind of leadership that is absolutely infuriating the president\u2019s enemies, but it\u2019s also energizing his base, especially his religious base of voters.\u201d\n\nTrump listed his administration\u2019s efforts on religious freedom and declared, \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot.\u201d\n\nAs for the climate summit, he told reporters as he left: \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in clean air and clean water and all countries should get together and do that, and they should do it for themselves. Very, very important.\u201d\n\nLate Monday, he mocked Swedish 16-year-old activist Greta Thunberg, who had scolded the audience at the climate summit, repeatedly asking, \u201cHow dare you?\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted: \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d\n\nThe Republican president arrived in New York against a backdrop of swirling international tensions, including questions about his relationship with Ukraine, the uncertain future of Brexit, the U.S. trade war with China, stalled nuclear negotiations with North Korea and a weakening global economy. The president met Monday with leaders of Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, Singapore, Egypt and South Korea.\n\nHis most immediate challenge may be Iran. He will try to convince skeptical global capitals to help build a coalition to confront Tehran after the United States blamed it for last week\u2019s strike at an oil field in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAsked as he arrived at the U.N. building if he will meet soon with Iran President Hassan Rouhani, Trump was noncommittal. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a long way to go, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s fulfillment of a campaign promise to exit the Iran nuclear deal has had wide ripple effects, leading Tehran to bolster its nuclear capabilities and dismaying European capitals who worked to establish the original agreement.\n\nTensions between Washington and Tehran spiked after a Saudi Arabia oil field was partially destroyed in an attack that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed on Iran and deemed \u201can act of war.\u201d\n\nHe also was noncommittal about a possible fourth meeting with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un to discuss the easing of sanctions in exchange for Pyongyang\u2019s commitment to give up its nuclear weapons. He said only that it \u201ccould happen soon.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s meetings with other leaders highlighted other hot spots around the globe.\n\nIn his meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Trump was peppered with questions from Pakistani reporters about India\u2019s role in the crisis in Kashmir. Khan has invited Trump to mediate the long-running conflict between Pakistan and India over the disputed Himalayan region. India has not agreed to mediation, but Trump renewed his offer to play middleman between the two nuclear-armed nations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never failed as an arbitrator,\u201d he said.\n\nWith Polish President Andrzej Duda, Trump said more U.S. troops will be stationed in Poland as a result of a new defense cooperation agreement they signed. He said Poland asked the U.S. to station more troops there and will pay for the new facilities.\n\nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien-Loong and Trump signed a memorandum to update defense cooperation between the two nations.\n\nWith President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt, Trump talked about the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, which the U.S. has blamed on Iran, and about Libya, which slid into chaos after a 2011 uprising that left the country split between rival authorities in the country\u2019s east and west.\n\nHis meeting with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was closed, but the White House said their talks included a discussion of the March shooting deaths of 51 people at mosques in Christchurch.\n\n___\n\nRiechmann reported from New York.
