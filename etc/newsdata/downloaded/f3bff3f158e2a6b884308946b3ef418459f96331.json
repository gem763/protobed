We picked a squad of 15 players and at no point did we come out saying we are not supporting any player. So irrespective of any other player that would've wanted to come out of retirement, not only AB alone.\n\n\"As far as my end and the board is concerned, the chapter is closed. If there is anything else it'll probably be coming from the team or AB himself.\"\n\nDe Villiers has yet to comment publicly on the matter.", "description": "Cricket South Africa CEO Thabang Moroe revealed that they will be trying to put the AB de Villiers bombshell behind them.", "authors": ["Lynn Butler -"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2755/8eb9acf0114f4848a2c3ffff41dde4da.png", "published_at": "2019-07-02"}
