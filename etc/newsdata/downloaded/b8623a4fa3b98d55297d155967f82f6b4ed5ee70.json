(Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times)\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 Attorney General William Barr pushed back Monday on criticism that the Justice Department is investigating the origins of the Russia inquiry to help President Donald Trump settle personal legal and political scores, insisting that he does not serve as the president\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s completely wrong and there is no basis for it,\u201d Barr said in an interview with Fox News on the sidelines of a major law enforcement conference in Chicago. \u201cI act on behalf of the United States.\u201d\n\nBarr also sought to distance himself from the investigation, though he is closely supervising it. Barr played down his overseas travel, which has gained attention in recent weeks, as an attempt to open doors for the lead investigator, the veteran prosecutor John H. Durham.\n\n\u201cHe is in charge of the investigation,\u201d Barr said of Durham. \u201cI\u2019m not doing the investigation.\u201d\n\nBarr\u2019s comments were his first public remarks after a cascade of revelations about the investigation, including that it has shifted from an administrative review to a criminal inquiry, meaning Durham can seek court orders for witness testimony and documents and convene a grand jury.\n\nTrump and his allies have long sought to undermine the origins of the Russia investigation, and depending on what Durham uncovers and when his findings are made public, his inquiry could provide a boon to Trump as he seeks reelection. The president has praised Barr for opening the investigation.\n\n\u201cThank you, Bill. You\u2019re doing a great job,\u201d Trump said to Barr on Monday during a speech at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Chicago. Trump asked the audience to applaud the attorney general to combat criticism of his work published by \u201cthe fake news.\u201d\n\nBarr traveled to Chicago to attend Trump\u2019s speech, meet with local law enforcement agencies and visit federal prosecutors.\n\nBarr\u2019s requests for help from foreign governments for the Durham investigation, including a pair of trips to Rome to meet with Italian intelligence officials, have drawn scrutiny because conservative allies of Trump have seized on those countries\u2019 roles in the start of the Russia investigation to stoke conspiracy theories.\n\nBarr portrayed his requests as an effort to aid Durham. The attorney general said that foreign governments had asked about the scope and nature of the Durham investigation and how the Justice Department would handle confidential information. He said he fielded those questions to help Durham, not to manage his investigation.\n\n\u201cI initially discussed these matters with those countries and introduced them to John Durham and established a channel by which Durham can obtain assistance from those countries,\u201d Barr said, emphasizing that Durham was running his own investigation.\n\nDurham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut and a veteran of politically charged investigations, and his investigators have interviewed nearly 30 former and current FBI and intelligence officials. They have asked whether any of the officials who investigated Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference and possible links to the Trump campaign exhibited anti-Trump bias.\n\nThe Durham team has homed in on aspects of the Russia investigation that Trump and his allies have long attacked, including the decisions surrounding a secret application to wiretap Carter Page, a Trump campaign adviser who was suspected of being groomed to be a Russian asset. Page has denied those allegations.\n\nTo conduct a thorough review of an investigation, however, Durham would have to run down all leads, even those that earlier investigations dismissed.\n\nBarr defended the Durham investigation as \u201cthorough and fair,\u201d adding that Durham was \u201cmaking great progress\u201d but declining to detail it.\n\nHe also extolled the FBI director, Christopher A. Wray, and the FBI agents whom Durham has interviewed, for their \u201coutstanding support and responsiveness.\u201d The praise was a sign that Barr was trying to maintain a good relationship with the FBI even as the Justice Department scrutinizes its most politically consequential investigation in a generation.\n\nBarr also implicitly criticized Wray\u2019s predecessor, James Comey, whom the president fired in 2017. Comey led the FBI during the political firestorm of 2016 that consisted not only of the Russia investigation but also of the inquiry into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information by using a private email server.", "description": "CHICAGO -- Attorney General William Barr pushed back Monday on criticism that the Justice Department is investigating the origins of the Russia inquiry to help President Donald Trump settle personal legal and political scores, insisting that he does not serve as the president's personal lawyer.\"", "authors": ["Katie Benner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UNHz7rKf7ZsxqIHWNDtzOQ--~B/aD0zNDMwO3c9NTE0NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/8c6fdbf8e490492ca27fcaf6db15b421", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
