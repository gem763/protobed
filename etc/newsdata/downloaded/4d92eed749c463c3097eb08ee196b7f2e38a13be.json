Before I met him, I was with another man for four years while we were at university, but we broke up because he cheated on me and made another woman pregnant.\n\nThis ex was my true love and still is, and I\u2019ve found out that he called my friend and said he\u2019d been trying to get in touch with me for the past year. He told her how sorry he was about what happened in the past and how much he still loves me, and that he wants me back.\n\nThe truth is, I\u2019ve been mad at him for a really long time \u2013 maybe too long. However, I still love him with all my heart. I love my husband, too, but in a very different way.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, as I don\u2019t want to break my husband\u2019s heart and disappoint our families by going back to my ex. And I\u2019m also scared of going back to him, only to find that he hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nI feel very confused \u2013 can you help?\n\nColeen says\n\nHonestly, I think you need to be very careful and think long and hard about what you\u2019ve got to lose. You\u2019ve moved on from this ex and got over the heartbreak, and you must have loved your husband enough to marry him and have children.\n\nThe truth is, we don\u2019t love people in the same way because we\u2019re all individuals and every relationship is unique. We love people for different reasons.\n\nThere\u2019s always romance and excitement attached to a first love or to \u201cthe one who got away\u201d. And sometimes if a relationship is slightly toxic there\u2019s something exciting about that, too.\n\nWe might be drawn to fixing it and trying to make it right, and it\u2019s never boring. So when we do meet someone who treats us well and there isn\u2019t much drama, it might feel boring.\n\nBe wary of going back to someone who\u2019s hurt you. Maybe he has changed or maybe he just wants what he can\u2019t have because he mucked it all up \u2013 to him, you\u2019re his one who got away.\n\nTry to remember why you\u2019re with your husband and think about whether your marriage just needs nudging out of a rut.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge risk to reconnect with this guy, so you\u2019d have to be very sure it was one worth taking.", "description": "We were together for four years while we were at university, but we broke up because he cheated on me and made another woman pregnant", "authors": ["Coleen Nolan", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20750387.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Thoughtful-woman-at-home.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
