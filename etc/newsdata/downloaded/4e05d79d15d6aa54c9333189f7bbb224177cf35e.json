Often a person will feel they have got to grips with their condition and then a new symptom will emerge.\n\nImage copyright Ronan Coyle Image caption Ronan says he plays golf to take his mind off the disease\n\nIt was while studying for his Irish history and politics degree that Ronan first noticed the symptoms.\n\n\"I was writing notes for an essay and I couldn't write properly,\" he said.\n\n\"Come exam time, I was under a lot of stress. It got really bad.\n\n\"Then I noticed my walking was funny. I went to a couple of neurologists and they more or less said you have a tremor and that it was nothing to worry about.\"\n\nWhen Ronan turned 30 he was referred to a neurologist in Belfast. After a number of scans it was confirmed that he had the disease.\n\nHow people react\n\nA survey of more than 2,000 people for Parkinson's UK, to mark World Parkinson's day, found that 87% of people with the condition had faced discrimination or harassment.\n\n24% of people had been told they were \"too young\" to have Parkinson's\n\n22% said their slurred speech or poor balance had been mistaken for drunkenness\n\n32% said their less expressive facial expressions had been mistaken for unfriendliness\n\n10% said they had been laughed at\n\nClick here for more information on Parkinson's Disease.\n\n\"Once I left the office, I went into the car and cried for a couple of minutes and then phoned my mum,\" Ronan said.\n\n\"I don't particularly shake all that much. I would be rigid and stiff and my balance would be bad at times.\n\nHe added: \"Whenever I was first diagnosed I didn't want to know much about it and didn't want to hear any horror stories. I kept myself in the dark more or less for a couple of years.\n\n\"It's not a great thing to hear that you have Parkinson's but it's by no means the end of the world. You can live a full and happy life.\"\n\nRonan works as a civil servant in Derry and he and his partner Elena, who is from Mexico City, got married this time last year.\n\nHe says Elena has been a rock for him throughout.\n\nImage copyright Ronan Coyle\n\n\"I met her in Ballina, County Mayo. She was working there. We have been together for two and a half years.\n\n\"She helps me so much with my condition. She gives me an incredible amount of support.\n\n\"Always encouraging me. Always by my side.\"\n\nHelp and information:\n\nNHS: Parkinson's disease\n\nParkinson's UK\n\nNICE: Parkinson's disease", "description": "Ronan Coyle from Londonderry first noticed the symptoms of Parkinson's when he was 24 years old.", "authors": ["Dean Mclaughlin", "Bbc News Ni"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DF23/production/_109032175_ronan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
