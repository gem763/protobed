This week on Kotaku Splitscreen, we discuss that question and much more.\n\nFirst, Kirk, Maddy, and I talk about the great new visual novel AI: The Somnium Files, the wonderfully addictive Fire Emblem, and Remnant: From the Ashes, aka Gears of Dark Souls. Then we get into news (34:07) on Nicalis and Apple Arcade, followed by off-topic talk (57:16) and the continued legend of Gardner Minshew II.\n\nWe also talk about this question from listener Annie:\n\nHello Jason, Maddy and Kirk! I\u2019ve been a longtime fan of the podcast, and I wanted to ask you guys something kind of silly! I\u2019ll keep this brief, but for context, I\u2019ve been playing a lot of Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey since I bought it last week (I know, I\u2019m very late to the party). One of my favourite parts of the game is the mercenary/bounty hunter tier system. Since my first mercenary kill, I\u2019ve made it a tradition for myself and my friends that play the game with me to throw the body of every defeated mercenary into the nearest body of natural water as if it were a sign of respect. We also salute the screen and fire a single arrow into the sky. We will do this even if we are in a pretty landlocked territory of the game. There is absolutely no real purpose to doing this, it\u2019s just hilarious to us and we do it solely out of tradition. So my question is this: do you guys have any weird unscripted video game traditions? (i.e., things that you\u2019ll always do that aren\u2019t required in the game at all?) Best Regards, Annie\n\nThe three of us didn\u2019t have many good answers, other than my habit of singing the Indiana Jones theme song every time I kill someone with a shotgun in Destiny PvP, so we\u2019ve asked our audience to tell us their own stories.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard some good ones already \u2014 a listener who plays Breath of the Wild solely as a pescatarian, one who does push-ups after every Call of Duty loss, and one who sticks their hand out and makes the peace symbol, \u00e0 la Mario in Super Mario World, every time they finish a video game level.\n\nSurely you also have your own strange habits. What\u2019s your weirdest video game ritual? Share below or hit us up with your best ones.", "description": "Do you have any bizarre rituals that you always perform in a video game, no matter what?
