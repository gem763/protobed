He was his department's first Sikh deputy. (Jon Shapley/Houston Chronicle/AP)\n\nOne of the first sheriff\u2019s deputies in the country to wear a traditional Sikh turban on duty was fatally shot from behind Friday while conducting a traffic stop in the Houston area, authorities said.\n\nSandeep Dhaliwal, a 10-year veteran of law enforcement, was shot multiple times by one of two people in the stopped car, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez told reporters.\n\n\u201cHe wore the turban. He represented his community with integrity, respect and pride,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAnd again, he was respected by all.\u201d\n\nDhaliwal, 41, was returning to his patrol car around 1 p.m. when a man got out of the stopped car with a pistol and shot him \u201cin a coldblooded manner, ambush-style,\u201d Gonzalez said. He said he did not know the reason for the stop or the motive for the shooting.\n\nFirst responders brought Dhaliwal to a hospital, where he was declared dead around 4 p.m.\n\nRobert Solis, 47, was charged with capital murder in connection with the killing, the sheriff\u2019s office announced Friday. He had an active parole-violation warrant in a January 2017 case in which he was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nA woman whom police believed to be a passenger in the stopped car was also in custody Friday, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Officials said they had confiscated the gun they believed Solis used in the shooting.\n\n[Texas sheriff allows Sikh officers to wear beards, turbans on patrol]\n\nDhaliwal, whom his colleagues described as a \u201ctrailblazer,\u201d owned a lucrative trucking business before he sold it to join the sheriff\u2019s department, said Harris County Commissioner Adrian Garcia. Dhaliwal wanted to build a bridge between the department and the Houston area\u2019s large Sikh community because of a prior \u201cmishap,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nGarcia did not offer details about that incident, but The Washington Post previously reported that he reached out to Sikhs in 2009 because of a confrontation with a Sikh family the prior year. When the family called to report a burglary, deputies reportedly were alarmed to see the men wearing beards and turbans and carrying small daggers, which Sikhs sometimes wear at their waists as a reminder of their faith\u2019s martial history. The deputies called for more officers and interrogated the family, The Post reported.\n\nA husband and a father of three children, Dhaliwal joined the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office as a detention officer and worked his way up. He was the first adherent of Sikhism, a monotheistic religion that originated in India, to become a deputy.\n\nThe Harris County sheriff in 2015 announced that Dhaliwal would be allowed to wear his religion\u2019s beard and turban while on patrol. At the time, only police departments in the District of Columbia and Riverside, Calif., had made that accommodation.\n\nDhaliwal was known to have a giving heart, Gonzalez said. He coordinated the arrival of a tractor-trailer that brought donations from California to the Houston area in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey. When a colleague\u2019s relatives in Puerto Rico needed help after Hurricane Maria the same year, Gonzalez said, Dhaliwal joined the department\u2019s trip to provide aid there.\n\nDhaliwal\u2019s last actions were ones of service, Gonzalez said.\n\n\u201cHe died a hero,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cHe died serving the Harris County community.\u201d\n\nOur Harris County community loves their law enforcement officers. Not surprised to learn that a community-led vigil is being organized this evening to pay respects to Deputy Dhaliwal. He\u2019s an incredible loss not only to our @HCSOTexas family but to the entire community. #HouNews pic.twitter.com/V4fdgHOkmK \u2014 Ed Gonzalez (@SheriffEd_HCSO) September 28, 2019\n\nSheriff\u2019s Office Maj. Mike Lee, who watched the dashboard-camera video of Dhaliwal\u2019s traffic stop, told reporters that the driver-side door of the suspect\u2019s car was open for about two minutes while Dhaliwal talked with him. The conversation did not appear combative, Lee said.\n\nDhaliwal then shut the car door and began to walk back to his patrol car, Lee said. About three seconds later, Lee said Solis opened the door, got out with a gun in his hand and ran toward Dhaliwal. He shot Dhaliwal in the back of the head, Lee said.\n\nA neighbor reported hearing two gunshots and seeing the shooter run away and leave in a \u201cgetaway car,\u201d Lee told reporters. He did not specify whether that car was the stopped vehicle or a different one. Authorities found the suspect inside a business about a quarter-mile from the shooting scene, Lee said.\n\nAs a sign of respect, Gonzalez said, sheriff\u2019s office deputies lined the walkway to the medical examiner\u2019s office when Dhaliwal\u2019s body was brought there. Community members later held an impromptu memorial vigil.\n\nHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner (D) said in a statement that he stood with Dhaliwal\u2019s family and the Sikh community.\n\n\u201cHe represented the diversity and inclusiveness of our community and everything that is good,\u201d Turner wrote. \u201cEvil you do not win here.\u201d\n\n[A Sikh airman petitioned the Air Force to let him wear a turban and beard. He just won.]\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said Dhaliwal\u2019s death was a reminder of the daily risks that law enforcement officers face.\n\n\u201cI thank the officers who bravely responded to apprehend the suspect, and I assure you that the state of Texas is committed to bringing this killer to justice,\u201d Abbott said in a statement.\n\nSimran Jeet Singh, senior fellow at the civil rights group Sikh Coalition, told The Post that only a handful of Sikhs have served in U.S. law enforcement. Most departments\u2019 policies ban headwear, Singh said, and few police forces have allowed Sikhs to wear beards and turbans on patrol.\n\n\u201cTo have an office that\u2019s opened itself up to Sikh service and also at the same time to have candidates who are interested and willing to get into this work, it\u2019s been quite challenging,\u201d Singh said.\n\nSikhism, the world\u2019s fifth-largest religion with about 25 million followers, emphasizes devotion to God, truthfulness, the equality of all people, and the denunciation of superstitions and blind rituals. There are about 500,000 Sikhs in the United States.\n\nSikhs frequently face discrimination in the United States They have been confused with Muslims \u2014 and wrongly associated with terrorism \u2014 since the 9/11 attacks. In 2012, a white-supremacist gunman killed six people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.\n\nRead more:\n\nSikh school bus driver reported years of harassment over his turban and beard\n\nMuslim woman says in lawsuit that Falls Church company wouldn\u2019t hire her because she wanted to pray at work\n\nNot a cute fashion accessory': Gucci\u2019s $800 \u2018Indy Full Turban\u2019 draws backlash\n\nThe U.S. once forced this Native American tribe to move.
