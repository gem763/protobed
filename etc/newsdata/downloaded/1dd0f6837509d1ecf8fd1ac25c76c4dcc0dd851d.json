He vowed to press forward with the campaign to rout Kurdish-led fighters, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, from a wide swath of territory along the border.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNobody can stop us until we reach 30 to 35 kilometers\u201d (19 to 22 miles) inside Syria, he said.\n\nVice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were scheduled to travel to Turkey on Wednesday as part of the administration\u2019s efforts to quell the chaos unleashed by the Turkish offensive, which critics warned could lead to a security vacuum in northeastern Syria.\n\nThe United States partnered with the SDF to battle the Islamic State in Syria. As the Turkish operation began, however, President Trump ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the area.\n\nErdogan said Wednesday that the U.S. delegation \u201cmust be prepared\u201d to consider Turkey\u2019s concerns in northeastern Syria, where a Kurdish-led administration has governed for years.\n\nAD\n\nTurkey views the SDF as terrorists for its links to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has waged a decades-long struggle for Kurdish autonomy inside Turkey.\n\nAD\n\nErdogan told reporters late Tuesday that Turkey would \u201cnever declare a cease-fire\u201d and that he was unconcerned with U.S. sanctions targeting senior Turkish officials over the offensive.\n\n\u201cThey are pressuring us to stop the operation. They are announcing sanctions. Our goal is clear,\u201d he said of the United States and other Western nations, in remarks carried by the state-owned Anadolu news agency.\n\nHe said he refused a U.S. proposal to broker a truce with Syrian Kurdish militants.\n\nTurkey will not \u201csit down at the table with terror groups,\u201d Erdogan said, Anadolu reported.\n\nAD\n\nThe Turkish offensive and U.S. move to withdraw troops prompted Syrian Kurdish leaders to strike a surprise deal with the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad earlier this week, paving the way for pro-government forces and allied Russian troops to fill a security vacuum in the north.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nRussia announced Tuesday that its units were patrolling between Turkish and Syrian military forces near the strategically important Syrian town of Manbij to prevent a confrontation. U.S. troops had withdrawn from Manbij just hours before.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Moscow expected the Turkish operation \u201cto be proportionate to the goal of national security.\u201d\n\nHe did not say when Russia believes Turkey might conclude the offensive.\n\nKareem Fahim in Istanbul, Sarah Dadouch in Beirut and Natasha Abbakumova in Moscow contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The Turkish leader issued the demand as Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo headed to Turkey for talks.", "authors": ["Erin Cunningham", "Middle East Reporter Covering Iran", "Turkey", "Syria", "The Wider Region"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tb3kjqVshE7bY7FpUKG6giBB-Lc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HAZYXJXP74I6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
