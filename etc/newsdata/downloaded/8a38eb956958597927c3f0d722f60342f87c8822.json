Here's my 3-pronged solution for making salary negotiations easier.", "language": "en", "text": "People whisper the word \"negotiation\" as if they're afraid to speak it aloud. Candidates and hiring managers alike shy away from it. But negotiation is not a dirty word \u2014 it's a normal, healthy part of any hiring process. As such, the negotiation process must take place out in the open between the hiring manager and the candidate. It's not something to be pawned off on a recruiter or ignored altogether. Open and frank negotiation during the hiring process \u2014 and as needed once the new hire is in place \u2014 builds trust between the employee and the organization.\n\nBut there's a right way and a wrong way to approach negotiation. Let's say the company is hiring a CEO, and the description only says something about the salary being \"executive level.\" The problem is that the meaning of \"executive level\" can vary wildly across industries. Perhaps one executive sees the posting and thinks the position looks promising. She is currently making $600,000 and believes this job will have similar compensation. When she finally talks salary \u2014 probably in the third or fourth interview \u2014 she is shocked to learn that the top compensation is $250,000. The discussion is terminated; both parties have wasted each other's time. This is the wrong way. The fact is that candidates are becoming savvier. Job postings don't rank as high in Google if they don't include a salary range. Candidates who want to know a range for their industry or a specific company just need to visit Glassdoor. People leaders and hiring managers should expect that any self-respecting candidate has done his homework and knows the approximate salary range for the job.\n\nRead more: A billionaire agreed to pay off my student loans in full. Here's what it was like \u2014 and how I plan to pay it forward.\n\nHow negotiation can be a win-win\n\nInstead of viewing negotiation as a zero-sum game, try thinking of it as a collaborative process. Both parties should assume good intent. The candidate understands the job that's being asked of him and how he could use his talents to best serve the company, while the hiring manager understands the candidate's needs. Both know the standard market rates for the position, because everyone has done their homework. Instead of seeing who comes out \"on top,\" they collaborate and work together to craft a deal. Both are clear about their needs and wants throughout the process. If hiring manager and candidate can arrive at a salary that suits both their needs, fantastic. If not, the candidate departs with no hard feelings.\n\nCaroline Stokes. Courtesy of Caroline Stokes\n\nA 2019 survey conducted by staffing firm Robert Half found that only 68% of men and 45% of women negotiated for higher salaries when receiving a job offer. What does this tell us?\n\nFirst, many job seekers are not taking advantage of the candidates' market. Second, women still negotiate less than men. Many studies have shown that women are more likely to advocate for others than to speak out on behalf of themselves.\n\nThird, it's worth it for candidates to push past their discomfort and negotiate for their full worth. Bonuses and raises are calculated from base salary, so a candidate who does not negotiate for a higher base salary is leaving money on the table more than once. But when it comes to top talent, or \"unicorns\" as I call them \u2014 the elusive magical individuals who leaders believe will turn the company around \u2014 you should expect them to negotiate. Likewise, as a people leader, you need to talk dollars and cents as early in the process as possible. It's the only way to have any kind of substantive discussion with a unicorn.\n\n1. Don't have a third party conduct a salary negotiation\n\nIn my experience, a recruiter discussing salary immediately puts the candidate on edge. A better practice is to bring the hiring manager into the discussion at this point, or even the CEO if the company is small. The fact is that great candidates have some very attractive options out there. If you're crazy about a candidate, you have to show that, and it will not get through if you have a third-party conducting salary negotiations. For critical hires, you have to get the key players involved.\n\nRead more: I'm a mom who quit my job, sold my house, and invested every dollar I had into launching a company that's grown 2,000% in 5 years\n\n2. Money isn't everything\n\nEven if you can't match the proposed salary, knowing your new hire's true needs may enable you to counteroffer with a package more suitable to her current situation. I've seen plenty of people turn down higher salaries and awesome perks to stay with employers they feel truly have their backs.\n\n3. Emotional intelligence matters\n\nThere is an emotional intelligence benefit when hiring managers leave the door open for candidates to discuss salary openly. Salary talks engage a candidate's stress-management capabilities. A candidate who exerts some control over her salary is likely to feel more positive about the final number and her employer as a whole. Likewise, a candidate who negotiates her salary is engaging the self-expression component of EQ, particularly assertiveness. A candidate who will assert herself is an asset to an organization; such an employee will speak up when needed, challenge outdated thinking, and articulate new paths forward.\n\nIf a candidate doesn't want to talk salary until later in the process, it's not an immediate issue. Depending on his background and motivations, he may not view it as appropriate. Or perhaps he is coming from the public sector, where exact salaries are searchable online and rarely up for negotiation.\n\nSimilarly, as a people leader, you shouldn't fall into the trap of thinking that all your direct reports should be exactly like you. Say you're incredibly ambitious and stay awake at night dreaming of ways to double, triple, or quadruple your salary. You should recognize that many candidates will not have this same point of view. That doesn't mean they won't work hard and be high performers \u2014 it just means they're not as financially aspirational, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.\n\nDon't count out a potential unicorn just because she doesn't share your financial goals.\n\nExcerpted with permission from the book Elephants Before Unicorns: Emotionally Intelligent HR Strategies to Save Your Companyby Caroline Stokes. \u00a9 2019 by Entrepreneur Media, Inc.\n\nCaroline Stokesis the founder of FORWARD, an executive headhunting and executive coaching company designed for global innovation leaders.
