In May, the Commerce Department added the company to the entity list, effectively barring American companies from selling supplies to them. That followed the arrest of Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, Ren\u2019s daughter, and a slew of lawsuits that pointed to deliberate attempts by the company to steal technology secrets from American firms.\n\nFormer Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge speaks during an event to mark the 15th anniversary of the Department of Homeland Security, March 1, 2018 in Washington, DC.

Last month, President Trump vowed the U.S. would not \u201cdo business with Huawei\u201d only to add that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t agree to something if and when we make a trade deal.\u201d Meanwhile the Department of Justice, which is conducting a criminal probe into the company, has maintained that Huawei remains separate from trade.\n\nRidge reiterated DOJ\u2019s stance, saying national security should not be used as a negotiating tool.\n\n\u201cAt some point in time, someone has to draw a line, a line of demarcation to say, okay, all these things we\u2019ll negotiate because it\u2019s in our mutual interest,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as far as I\u2019m concerned, national security and Huawei being embedded in your network, that is a non-negotiable item.\u201d\n\nA woman gets her bearing outside a Huawei store in Beijing Monday, May 20, 2019.

In July, CEOs of seven tech companies including Google\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) Sundar Pichai met with administration officials in Washington. Shortly after, the Commerce Department granted Huawei a 90-day extension, to comply with the trade ban.\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft (MSFT) President Brad Smith, whose company supplies Windows software to Huawei, said the administration\u2019s policies against Huawei could lead to a \u201cnew digital iron curtain down the Pacific.\u201d\n\nWhile the U.S. has convinced close allies like Australia and Japan to ban the use of Huawei equipment in its 5G infrastructure, Europe has remained more cautious in its response to American claims of espionage. With the European Agency for Cybersecurity set to release its complete threat assessment of its 5G strategy on Oct. 1, Ridge urged EU members to reconsider their use of Huawei equipment.\n\n\u201cCheaper and faster is not a reason to compromise national security,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that their assessment is clear.\u201d\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
