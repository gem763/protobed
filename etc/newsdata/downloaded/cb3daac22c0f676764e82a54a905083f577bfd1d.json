We will stick together to fight for freedom,\u201d said Sam, 33, dressed in black and wearing a mask. \u201cMost people think Hong Kong was dying after five years, but many people are still fighting for Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nA series of protests for and against Communist Party rulers in Beijing is planned for the Chinese-ruled city ahead of the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic on Tuesday, including at the consulate of former colonial power Britain.\n\nThe Hong Kong building of the Chinese state-owned investment company CITIC, next to the Legislative Council, ran a huge purple LED-lit banner down its front commemorating National Day.\n\nAnti-government protesters have attacked the legislature, Beijing\u2019s main Liaison Office, occupied the airport, thrown petrol bombs at police, vandalized metro stations and set street fires in more than three months of unrest.\n\nPolice have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds fired into the air.\n\nThe MTR subway system closed entrances to some stations on Saturday to prevent fresh attacks. There were some small scuffles with police who responded with pepper spray. Large, peaceful gatherings have often turned violent at night.\n\nThe student-led Umbrella protests gridlocked the city for 79 days in 2014 but failed to wrest concessions from Beijing.\n\nLENNON WALLS\n\n\u201cThey are not our children,\u201d China supporter Yau Mei-kwang said of the frontline activists. \u201cBecause at this age, they should be studying, not running to the airport, hitting people, hitting the police, insulting people. That is not right.\u201d\n\nA pro-democracy protester who only gave his name as Wong defended the use of violence. \u201cWe know that they will not listen if we rally in peace because we are not on the same level.\u201d\n\nProtesters spent the afternoon rebuilding \u201cLennon Walls\u201d of anti-government graffiti, some of which were torn down by pro-Beijing activists last weekend.\n\nThe large mosaics of Post-it notes calling for democracy have cropped up in underpasses, outside shopping centers, at bus stops and universities and outside the Legislative Council.\n\nAnti-government protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.\n\n\u201cLennon Walls carry the spirit of civil disobedience from the Umbrella movement,\u201d said pro-democracy protester Kelvin Law, 24.\n\n\u201cI am not sure when this protest will end. Either we win or we lose. But as long as we are united and fight, generation after generation, we can achieve democracy.\u201d\n\nProtesters appealed to Britain two weeks ago to rein in China and ensure it respects the city\u2019s freedoms. They plan to do so again on Tuesday.\n\nBROADER MOVEMENT\n\nBritain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. At the same time, it is pinning its hopes on closer trade and investment cooperation with China after it leaves the European Union, due at the end of October.\n\nProtests were sparked in June by planned legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement.\n\nOne of the leaders of the protests, the bespectacled Joshua Wong, 22, said on Saturday he will run for local district council elections in November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to let Emperor Xi (Chinese President Xi Jinping) be aware that now is our battle,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe stand in solidarity, we stand as one.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China marked the Umbrella anniversary with a statement denouncing the \u201caccelerated erosion\u201d of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Hong Kong government to make the selection of the Chief Executive and the election of all members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage a priority and take concrete steps to strengthen Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy,\u201d it said.\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\nDan Garrett, a U.S. academic who gave evidence before the commission, said on Twitter he was not allowed to land in Hong Kong on Thursday for the first time in 20 years of visiting and living in the territory.\n\nOfficial festivities for National Day have been scaled back, with authorities keen to avoid embarrassing Beijing just as Xi seeks to project an image of national strength and unity.", "description": "Thousands of protesters chanted anti-government slogans and sang their \"Glory to Hong Kong\" anthem on Saturday, marking the fifth anniversary of the \"Umbrella\" pro-democracy movement as protests which have gridlocked the territory for weeks continued.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434819477&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R070", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
