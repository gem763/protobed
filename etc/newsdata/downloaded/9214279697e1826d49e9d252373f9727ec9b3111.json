After co-founder Adam Neumann stepped down last month, new co-CEOs shelved the IPO, made plans to lay off thousands, and embarked on other cost-cutting measures like selling the company\u2019s private jet and closing WeGrow, its educational arm.\n\nNow, WeWork, which has seen its credit rating sink to junk status, could run out of cash as soon as the end of November, The Financial Times reported last week. The company is exploring options to help with the cash crunch.\n\nOne solution could be taking more money from its largest investor. SoftBank could invest several billion in new equity and debt, the Journal said.\n\nRead more: Sex, tequila, and a tiger: Employees inside Adam Neumann\u2019s WeWork talk about the nonstop party to attain a $100 billion dream and the messy reality that tanked it\n\nThe Japanese investor calculated that WeWork needs at least $3 billion to operate through next year, according to the Journal. The SoftBank deal would reportedly see much of Neumann\u2019s voting power shift to the investor, which already has two board seats, and the company would play a bigger part of leading WeWork\u2019s turnaround.\n\nSoftBank could buy in at a valuation below $10 billion, the Journal added. The company last valued WeWork at $47 billion in a January investment round.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s money could also be used in part to help Neumann repay his hundreds of millions in personal bank loans.\n\nWeWork is also looking at a potential bailout package with JPMorgan\n\nsource Reuters / Kate Munsch\n\nSoftBank isn\u2019t WeWork\u2019s only option for a bailout. The company has been working with major lender JPMorgan to work out a debt package that could be in the billions.\n\nA source told Business Insider top WeWork executives spent last week in JPMorgan\u2019s New York headquarters.\n\n\u201cWeWork has retained a major Wall Street financial institution to arrange financing,\u201d a WeWork representative told Business Insider in a statement. \u201cApproximately 60 financing sources have signed confidentiality agreements and are meeting with the company\u2019s management and its bankers over the course of this past week and this coming week.\u201d\n\nSee more: How WeWork spiraled from a $47 billion valuation to talk of bankruptcy in just 6 weeks\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also reported that SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son picked Marcelo Claure, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, to help WeWork\u2019s co-CEOs. Claure, the former CEO of Sprint, has been working with about 20 SoftBank employees to evaluate WeWork\u2019s global leases and real estate.\n\nA representative for SoftBank declined to comment to Business Insider.\n\nWeWork has 528 locations in 111 cities.\n\nGot a tip?
