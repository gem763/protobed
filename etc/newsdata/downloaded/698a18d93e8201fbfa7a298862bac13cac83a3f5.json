On Tuesday, Member of Parliament Phillip Lee defected to the Liberal Democrats, causing Conservative Johnson to lose his slim working majority in the House of Commons.\n\nLee said the U.K. government was pursuing Brexit in \u201cdamaging\u201d and \u201cunprincipled\u201d ways that would put \u201clives and livelihoods at risk.\u201d His decision was met with applause.\n\nAnd in a letter to the newly appointed prime minister, Lee said Brexit divisions \u201csadly transformed this once great party into something more akin to a narrow faction in which one's Conservatism is measured by how recklessly one wants to leave the European Union. ... It has become infected by the twin diseases of English nationalism and populism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFilm producer and \u201cLove Actually\u201d actor Hugh Grant shared that sentiment: \u201cYou will not destroy the freedoms my grandfather fought two world wars to defend,\u201d he said in a profanity-laced tweet, going on to call the prime minister a \"rubber bath toy.\"\n\n\u201cBritain is revolted by you,\" he continued.\n\nUntil recently, Johnson insisted there was \u201creal momentum\u201d behind Brexit talks, per the BBC, and issued an ultimatum to deter any defectors, cautioning them to vote for his exit plan or effectively get booted from the party.\n\nBut a wave of opposition has slowed that momentum. Many officials, including former Tory Parliamentary Member Sarah Wollaston, have crossed party lines to stop Johnson\u2019s plan.\n\nJohnson said Parliamentary members\u2019 resistance to his plan would \u201cdestroy any chance of negotiating a new deal\u201d and that he would push for a general election on Oct. 14 if they are successful in passing no-deal legislation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost a working majority in the House of Commons, as opposition grew to his \"no deal\" Brexit push.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
