Firefly Aerospace was founded in 2013 and has raised $21.6 million so far to bring its first product, the Alpha small satellite launch vehicle, to market.\n\nFirefly is on track to make its crucial first launch in time for the February to March time frame next year, according to Firefly founder and CEO Dr. Tom Markusic, who spoke at the International Astronautical Congress this year in Washington, D.C., to provide an update on his company\u2019s progress and talk about the newly formed partnership between Firefly and Aerojet Rocketdyne.\n\nMarkusic was joined by Aerojet Rocketdyne SVP of Space Business Jim Maser, and the two executives explained how Aerojet will provide engines for Firefly to use on its next-generation launch vehicle, aptly named \u201cBeta,\u201d the full development of which will follow once Alpha has launched and enters into regular commercial service.\n\nBeta will be a medium launch vehicle, with greater cargo capacity compared to Alpha and a maximum load of around 8.5 metric tons. Alpha, the startup\u2019s first rocket, will be able to take 1 metric ton to orbit, which Markusic said his company has identified as the \u201csweet spot\u201d for current unaddressed demand.\n\nThat medium band is also underserved, Markusic said, and because it\u2019ll need a bigger booster to transport that larger cargo capacity to orbit, they looked around for solutions and found that Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s AR-1 Engine, which can produce 500,000 pounds of thrust, was the perfect solution.\n\nIn general, Markusic and Maser both expressed the opinion that startup and younger companies just getting into the industry are prime partners for older companies like Aerojet, which was founded in 1942 and has been serving the rocket and missile industry ever since.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to move fast and it\u2019s okay to make mistakes, but let\u2019s not make other peoples\u2019 mistakes and let\u2019s not make our own mistakes twice,\u201d Markusic said, characterizing the benefits of teaming up with someone with lots more experience. This partnership goes beyond just the engine supply arrangement, Markusic said, and will provide more far-ranging benefits for the startup.\n\n\u201cAerojet Rocketdyne has a whole corral of amazing in-space propulsion options, for example the XR-5,\u201d Markusic said, \u201cwhich is a five kilowatt hull thruster that can be utilized on our OTV (orbital transfer vehicle), and advanced OTV, we could do some heavier missions in cis-lunar space, and they also have a large corral of flight proven by proposed chemical thrusters that can be used on these other stages as well.\u201d\n\nFirefly plans to do an orbital transfer vehicle to provide more advanced launch capabilities, and its ambitions extend even beyond launchers and to in-space manufacturing, which Markusic said is attractive to the company since the ultimate way to reduce launch costs is to obviate the need for launch costs altogether. The company\u2019s ultimate goal is to get more commercial satellites into orbit, regardless of method. Still, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity, but Markusic says ultimately, the company\u2019s biggest challenge right now is remaining focused on their most immediate, and most important goal.\n\n\u201cThere are at least 100 companies like Firefly talking about going to space,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in that crowd of talkers right now, and it is my focus with this company to get us out of that crowd of people talking about it as soon as possible, and into the elite crowd of people that are actually flying a spacecraft to space.\u201d", "description": "In a perfect example of a small, new space startup teaming up with a legacy industry heavyweight with plenty of experience, Firefly is teaming up with Aerojet Rocketdyne.
