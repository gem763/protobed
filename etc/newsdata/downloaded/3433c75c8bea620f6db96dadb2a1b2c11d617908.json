We need to have more continuity.\n\n'We did some things well, to be honest. But, in truth, we can't play a game like that.\n\nLago Junior's fantastic solo goal put Mallorca ahead in the seventh minute on Saturday night\n\n'I'm not going to tell you I'm concerned, but we need to have more continuity.\n\n'We need to bring a bit more life to our play if we want to achieve big things this year.'\n\nAlthough Real had won five and drawn three of their opening eight league games, they have struggled in Europe this season.\n\nReal lost their Champions League opener 3-0 to Paris St Germain before being held 2-2 at home by Belgian outsiders Club Brugge.\n\nThe visitors were reduced to 10 men after Alvaro Odriozola received a second yellow card\n\nTheir latest setback came with Gareth Bale, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos all sidelined by injury and Eden Hazard missing after his wife gave birth.\n\nKarim Benzema struck the crossbar in the first half but Real were running out of ideas when they were reduced to 10 men by Odriozola's second yellow card.\n\n'Injuries are part of football. We had other players and they need to do better,' Zidane said.\n\n'Having players out is the circumstances we face and we have to overcome that.\n\n'There are other players, who are good. We need to show that every player has the ability to play here.\n\n'We didn't play the game we wanted. When we start a game the way we started this one it makes it tough.\n\n'They scored, then they sat back and we couldn't find the solution.\n\n'We need to analyse it properly. We can't be happy with the match.'\n\nReal Madrid's unbeaten start to the La Liga season came to an abrupt end in Mallorca\n\nReal return to Champions League action on Tuesday with a trip to Galatasaray in Turkey.\n\n'We know what we're playing for,' Zidane said.\n\n'We need to play to win because there's no other option there. We need to focus on winning on Tuesday.'\n\nMallorca's third win of the season took them out of the relegation zone and in to 14th place.\n\nGoalkeeper Manolo Reina had few serious saves to make, even though Mallorca had to defend for long periods.", "description": "Zinedine Zidane complained of Real Madrid's inconsistency after his side lost their unbeaten LaLiga record to Real Mallorca and top spot to Barcelona.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/00/19936130-0-image-a-27_1571526333330.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
