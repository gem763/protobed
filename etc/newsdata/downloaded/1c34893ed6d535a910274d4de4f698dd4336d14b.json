FOREX-Dollar perched at seven-week highs vs yen before Fed decision * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\nBy Saikat Chatterjee\n\nLONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - The dollar held near a\n\nseven-week high against the Japanese yen on Wednesday before the\n\noutcome of a Federal Reserve meeting where officials are widely\n\nexpected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage\n\npoint.\n\n\"The focus will be on the policy outlook and the Fed's dot\n\nplots, and with market positioning broadly neutral, it should be\n\na quiet session for the dollar,\" said Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency\n\nstrategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.\n\nAgainst the yen , the dollar edged up 0.1% to 108.23\n\nyen, just below a seven-week high of 108.37 yen tested\n\novernight. The dollar index against a basket of other currencies\n\nrose to 98.28.\n\nThe dollar has been driven more by trade tensions between\n\nWashington and Beijing this year than by U.S. monetary policy.\n\nThe dollar has gained nearly 1% against the yen since the last\n\nrate cut in July.\n\nMorgan Stanley strategists believe that any dollar upside is\n\nlikely to be capped, because market expectations are not overly\n\ndovish and a trade deal between the United States and China\n\nseems likely.\n\nA retreat in global oil prices also restored some calm to\n\nmarkets. Oil prices fell in Asia, extending Tuesday's 6%\n\ndecline, after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said the kingdom\n\nhad tapped stockpiles to restore oil supplies to where they\n\nstood before weekend attacks shut around 5% of global output.\n\nThe euro was steady at $1.10620, more than 1% above the\n\n$1.0927 it reached last week, the lowest in more than two years.\n\nAfter the Fed releases its policy decision, attention will\n\nturn to the Bank of Japan's meeting ending on Thursday to see if\n\nit follows its global peers by easing policy.\n\nDeepening negative rates will be an option if the BOJ eases,\n\nalthough the central bank may accompany that with measures to\n\nmitigate the pain on financial institutions, sources have told\n\nReuters.
