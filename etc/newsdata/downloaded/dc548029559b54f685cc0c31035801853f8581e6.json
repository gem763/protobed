So many small teams came and went and didn\u2019t really add to Formula One.\u201d\n\nThree new teams entered in 2010, when a budget cap was proposed but never happened, but all are now defunct.\n\nOne was Campos Meta, run by former grand prix driver Adrian Campos, who struggled to find funding and were sold before a debut as Hispania, later HRT F1.\n\nThe most recent all-new entrants are U.S.-owned Haas, who made their debut in 2016 and have a close technical partnership with Ferrari.\n\n\u201cJoining the Formula One World Championship in 2021 shall be a long-term project,\u201d said Campos co-owner and MIM founder Salvatore Gandolfo in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the big challenges ahead of us, but we have a team of experts working day and night and the financial solidity required by the FIA to make this project a success.\n\n\u201cWith the new budget cap, the new distribution of incomes and the new technical and sporting regulations, there is a great opportunity for smaller teams to compete and ultimately to make (Formula One) more interesting and balanced again.\u201d", "description": "Formula One has played down talk of new teams lining up on the starting grid in 2021, saying there were currently 'no serious discussions' about such a move.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
