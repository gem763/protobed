I am taking a stand against this revolting behaviour,' she captioned her post.\n\n'I have heard some really disturbing things in the last 24 hours and I'm not going to stand for it,' she began.\n\n'Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but to get so invested into a TV show and then contacted people off it just to tell just to tell them to kill themselves (or that they will kill them). It is revolting,' she wrote.\n\nEssay: The star of the controversial reality show uploaded a near 300-word essay on her Instagram page on Sunday, and received overwhelming support from her fans\n\nTori said cast members had been threatened online and even on the street on a daily basis.\n\nShe said although trolling was common she hated it existed, and it was an entirely different problem when online users 'threaten violence against people'.\n\n'Yes we are all on TV but we are real people with real emotions and to think something may happen to one of the cast members because these sick individuals are so invested in a show. It is so wrong,' she wrote.\n\nTargetted: Tori said cast members had been threatened online and even on the street on a daily basis\n\n'There are parents that (sic) can not leave their house, there are couples that (sic) can not leave their house and this is our or pure fear for their safety and the anxiety of if they will be abused on the street again.'\n\nThe bride-to-be ended her piece by stating that no one deserves to be abused and certainly not to face death threats.\n\nTori was quickly met with a huge amount of support from fans, with some recommending she forward the messages to police.\n\n'Screenshot it and report it to the police. It's actually against the law to encourage someone to kill themselves,' one woman said.\n\nTori agreed but said many people were 'gutless' and hiding behind a fake profile.", "description": "One of the key stars of Seven's Bride and Prejudice has lashed out after a flood of death threats were made against her fellow cast members.", "authors": ["Tom Place For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/05/19819772-0-image-a-50_1571285403541.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
