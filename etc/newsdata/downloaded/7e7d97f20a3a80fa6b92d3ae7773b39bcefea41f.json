We had nobody even hurt,\u201d the president added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why the dog was so great.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Hero Dog Frida, Who Helped Find Survivors After 2017 Mexico Earthquake, Retires\n\nAccording to Trump\u2019s remarks, the dog had been sent into a dead-end tunnel to chase down and corner al-Baghdadi, who operatives believed was wearing a suicide vest.
