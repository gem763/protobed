Frank Milstead.\n\nJackson, who was fired from his job, was arrested Tuesday.\n\n'It tarnishes the badge we all wear': Los Angeles police officer charged with multiple rapes after DNA links him to cold case\n\nJackson initially was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in early June during a traffic stop and was placed on administrative leave, Milstead said. An investigation into Jackson's conduct was launched immediately afterward, leading to eight other women who were victimized by Jackson, he said.\n\nOfficials believe that Jackson was giving leniency to women he stopped for traffic violations in exchange for sexual favors. He also would detain the women even if they weren't facing any criminal offense, effectively holding them hostage, the DPS said.\n\nJackson also is suspected of falsifying department citations and worksheets.\n\nMilstead did not disclose further details because the investigation is still ongoing.\n\nJackson was was expected to be booked into the Maricopa County Fourth Avenue Jail Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities believe there are more victims who have yet to come forward.\n\n\"I implore anyone who has had contact with Trooper Jackson, who may have been affected by contact with him, who may have been victimized either through commentary or through physical action by Trooper Jackson, to please come forward and let us know about your inappropriate experience,\" Milstead said.\n\nThe DPS hotline is (602) 223-2389. The department has also set up an online complaint form specifically for victims to get in contact with detectives, which can be found at azdps.gov/Jackson.\n\nSerial rape suspect was hired by police: Serial rape suspect arrested by Georgia police more than a year after they hired him\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Trooper arrested on 61 counts of sex abuse, kidnapping and harassment", "description": "Tremaine Jackson, a 13-year DPS veteran, is facing 61 criminal counts of sex abuse, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and more, officials said.", "authors": ["Nicole Soto", "Arizona Republic"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
