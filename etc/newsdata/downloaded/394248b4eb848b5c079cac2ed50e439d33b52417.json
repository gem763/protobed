In the 20 years the park has existed, it has seen its visitation rise 50% from 200,000 to more than 300,000 last year. With that increased visitation, the park\u2019s superintendent anticipates improvements in infrastructure such as additional parking, a shuttle bus service and more trails for visitors to use.\n\nMore visitors are a boost to the regional hospitality industry, too. Studies show that monuments which become national parks don\u2019t necessarily see a huge bump in the number of visitors. But they do see a change in the types of visitors, with more people coming from outside the immediate area, staying longer in the area and spending more money.\n\nIt\u2019s fanciful, perhaps, to think how Grand Junction\u2019s hospitality industry would be impacted if Colorado National Monument ever became a national park. The political will behind Black Canyon\u2019s ascent to a national park has been difficult to engender here.\n\nBut any increase in visitors to the Monument would be beneficial. The latest National Park Service estimate is that 375,000 annual visitors at Colorado National Monument in the 2018 calendar year resulted in $28.9 million in economic output in local communities.\n\nBlack Canyon\u2019s superintendent, Bruce Noble, says park status turned the canyon into a \u201cmust-see\u201d destination. As long-time advocates for upgrading CNM to a national park, we think the same thing would happen here if Colorado National Monument became Rim Rock National Park (or some other less confusing name).\n\nAside from an economic boost, national park status is the only way to ensure that the Monument remains a community asset in perpetuity. Park status requires an act of the United States Congress. Creation of a national monument requires only an executive order of the president. Currently, Colorado National Monument could be altered by a stroke of the president\u2019s pen. We\u2019ve seen that happen in neighboring Utah.\n\nAs we\u2019ve pointed out on numerous occasions, the governing statutes for a national monument and a national park are identical. There are no stricter air quality standards or other rules. Furthermore, language could be drafted that would specifically prohibit stricter air rules and protect the rights of Glade Park residents who use roads through the Monument.\n\nClearly this a heavy lift or it would have happened by now. But national park designation for Black Canyon provides ample evidence that it\u2019s doable and beneficial. We just have kept the dream alive until the right set of circumstances aligns with overwhelming community support.\n\nConsider this our periodic pitch to keep the idea top of mind.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/32IHtxc\n\n___\n\nThe Durango Herald, Oct. 22, on pocketbook voting and prospects for President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election:\n\nHere is some terrific news: The U.S. economy could hum along quite nicely between now and Nov. 3, 2020, at least from the perspective of anyone who owns stocks, has a 401K, is a PERA beneficiary, owns property or works for wages.\n\nThat is the possibility Moody\u2019s Analytics, the economic research firm, took into account when it recently released a series of predictions for the 2020 elections.\n\nMoody\u2019s used three models to determine \u201cwhether the incumbent presidential candidate will win the popular vote in each state and the District of Columbia, and thus the necessary electoral college votes to win the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the pocketbook model,\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza writes, \u201cwhich places heavy emphasis on gas prices, housing prices and real personal income, Trump is predicted to win with 351 electoral votes. Using the stock market model \u2026 Trump wins far more narrowly, with 289 electoral votes. The unemployment model, which mixes real personal income with state-by-state unemployment rates, projects a Trump victory with 332 electoral votes.\n\n\u201cAverage the three \u2026 and you get \u2026 Trump with 332 electoral votes, and the Democratic nominee with 206 electoral votes. That result, if it came to pass, would be a marked improvement from Trump\u2019s showing in 2016 when he won with 305 electoral votes.\u201d\n\nDemocrats could be hoisted by their own petard.\n\nIn 1992, running the governor of Arkansas to try to deny President George H.W. Bush a second term, James Carville, a Bill Clinton strategist, told campaign workers to remember several key messages.\n\nCarville wanted to keep it simple. Unseating Bush was daunting, as it is to unhorse any incumbent president. The last time it had happened, it had befallen a Democrat, 12 years before: Jimmy Carter.\n\nCarville told them to keep in mind three things: Change versus more of the same. Don\u2019t forget health care. And, \u201cThe economy, stupid.\u201d It was the last one that stuck.\n\nThere is no reason why it could not work again; it ought to work better for an incumbent, if his campaign can make the argument that any Democrat will reverse a tax cut and not stop there, raising taxes on the middle class and eliminating millions of jobs in the health care and energy sectors.\n\nBut what about economic inequality? What about the lack of affordable access to health care? What about Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and global warming? What about taxing wealth and breaking up the big corporations that are riding this prosperity? What about getting rid of Trump?\n\nIt is possible none of that will matter to many voters next Nov. 3 if they perceive the alternatives to Trump will make them poorer.\n\nWe sometimes say that people who express their economic interests as they perceive them are \u201cpocketbook voters,\u201d as though they are a rare species, when it is the idealists and crusaders who are rarer; they are just louder.\n\nCan any of the Democratic candidates pivot to a message of maintaining prosperity, without abandoning the plans they are now announcing and without accepting some inequality? It would take fancy stepping.\n\nIn 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville observed of America, \u201cI know of no country \u2026 where the love of money has taken stronger hold on the affections of men and where the profounder contempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of property.\u201d\n\nWriting of conditions in America a century later, John Steinbeck said, \u201cExcept for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. \u2026 I guess the trouble was that we didn\u2019t have any self-admitted proletarians. Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist.\u201d\n\nEighty years on and facing 2020, one has to ask what if anything has changed.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/31GBV5l\n\n___\n\nThe Pueblo Chieftain, Oct. 20, on improving oversight of county finances:\n\nLast week, Pueblo County Commission Chairman Garrison Ortiz and his former commission colleague, Sal Pace, got into a war of words that was at least a year or two overdue. In response to Pace\u2019s public opposition to a ballot initiative to fund a new jail, Ortiz accused Pace of \u201cmisappropriating\u201d county funds during his time on the commission.\n\nThat led to a spirited back-and-forth exchange between the two, documented by our reporter Anthony Mestas, about who knew what when on some funding decisions. Since a recently released audit raised a number of questions about how county dollars have been spent, it was a discussion that makes for more than good political theater.\n\nCounty officials need to address the record keeping and procedural deficiencies identified in that audit. Ortiz says that\u2019s already happening, but we may not be able to gauge how effective any reforms have been until the next audit is released.\n\nOne of the most basic steps county officials can take is ensuring there are what auditors describe as adequate \u201csegregation of duties\u201d in all situations in which money is being collected, stored or spent. That\u2019s basically a fancy way of saying there should be a system of checks and balances to guard against misappropriation or embezzlement of funds.\n\nFor example, the clerk who\u2019s collecting fees from citizens shouldn\u2019t be the same person who\u2019s recording those transactions and depositing the money in the bank, at least not without one or more other people double checking that work.\n\nThis concept applies at the macro level as well. No one county commissioner should be able to order a county employee - be it the county manager, a department director or anyone else - to spend money for any purpose other than what the majority of commissioners have agreed to do in a public meeting. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this would include a scenario where, for example, one commissioner might want to redirect money approved for youth sports fields to instead support construction of a minor league baseball stadium.\n\nSpeaking of youth sports fields brings us to the mess the audit identified at the Runyon Sports Complex. And no matter how the complex\u2019s longtime supporters might try to spin it, there was a mess.\n\nHow else would someone characterize a situation in which the complex\u2019s board of directors was unaware, apparently for years, of two separate accounts in which money was collected and spent on expenses that were directly or indirectly linked to complex activities?\n\nNot long after the audit findings were revealed, David Dudley announced plans to step down from his position as the complex\u2019s general manager. That move probably is best for everyone involved.\n\nCounty officials have been delegating management responsibilities at Runyon to a nonprofit board, but it\u2019s clear they need to have more direct oversight over what\u2019s happening there. The complex is a public facility and it needs to be treated as such by the public officials entrusted to its care.\n\nSome of the allegations that came to light last week during Ortiz and Pace\u2019s verbal skirmish might have been confusing to citizens who have been kept in the dark about the inner workings of their county government. But there\u2019s no time like the present to increase transparency and accountability with regard to how those taxpayer funds are being spent.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/31JybzQ\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, Oct. 22, on national park status for Black Canyon of the Gunnison and Colorado National Monument:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
