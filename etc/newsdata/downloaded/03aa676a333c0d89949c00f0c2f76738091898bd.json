Lucky girl. The prize comes with a financial award of 83,000 Pound Sterling. That\u2019s one million Swedish kronor (\u00a383,000 or $103,000). Not bad for a 16-year-old high school student.\n\nWith climate alarmism playing such a big part of the 2019 U.N. general assembly, the young woman will continue to be the belle of the ball. The Right Livelihood Award is defined as an international award to \u201chonour and support those offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today.\u201d It has no actual ties to the awarding institutions of the Nobel Prize or the Nobel Foundation, though Greta was nominated for one of those earlier this year.\n\nThunberg is being recognized \u2018for inspiring and amplifying political demands for urgent climate action reflecting scientific facts,\u2019 the Swedish prize foundation said. The Swedish teenager, who has grabbed the world\u2019s attention this week with a fiery speech at the UN, was also hailed for \u2018personifying the notion that everyone has the power to create change\u2019.\n\nThe teen activist, best known for encouraging her fellow students to play hookey in the name of protesting and marching against climate change, was allowed to address the world leaders at the United Nations Monday. She sternly and emotionally scolded them for essentially ruining her life. Adults are not doing enough and even the laughably unworkable Green New Deal that so many on the far left have embraced as the path forward isn\u2019t enough for her. She did admit, though, that she should be back in Sweden and attending school. I\u2019ll agree with that part of her temper tantrum one hundred percent.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. This teenager is being exploited by adults with egos the size of Texas and political agendas that smack of socialism, at best, and communism at worst. Her shenanigans sometimes end up causing a bigger carbon footprint than if she had just acted as a regular human being.\n\nGreta suffers from Asperger\u2019s, a neurological condition. She was exposed to environmental alarmism propaganda at the hands of her own parents at age 8. By the time she was eleven years old, she was so affected by climate alarmism that she became depressed, stopped talking and stopped eating. She was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and selective mutism. These were conditions that appear to have been brought about directly from her early exposure to such radical propaganda. This, to me, is child abuse.\n\nI am not angry with Greta Thunberg, I feel sorry for her. Frankly, she doesn\u2019t know any better. I blame her parents and other adults in her life who have deliberately exploited this girl and guided her into the spotlight. Her health and mental well-being have suffered. It\u2019s not the effects of environmental changes that are ruining her life \u2013 it\u2019s the adults in her life.\n\nGreta won\u2019t even be around to accept her cash prize and award. She\u2019ll be in Chile, doing her thing.\n\nAn award ceremony is planned in Stockholm on December 4, six days before the Nobel prizes are handed out. However, Thunberg plans to be in Chile for a climate summit in December so it is unlikely she will be there. \u2018I\u2019m deeply grateful for being one of the recipients of this great honour,\u2019 Thunberg said. \u2018But of course, whenever I receive an award, it is not me who is the winner. I am part of a global movement of school children, youth and adults of all ages who have decided to act in defence of our living planet.\u2019 The award \u2018is a huge recognition for [school strike movement] Fridays For Future and the climate strike movement,\u2019 she said.\n\nThis is where we are. Far-left adults are being led around by school children. The adults listening to her at the United Nations were nodding in agreement and smiling. She\u2019s being exploited and those who are doing it should be held accountable.", "description": "\"Inspiring\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Greta-Thunberg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
