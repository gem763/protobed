Here\u2019s what I learned about impeachment.", "language": "en", "text": "Many of those same Republicans \u2014 who lived for nearly five decades under GOP Reps. Henry J. Hyde and Peter Roskam \u2014 had never had a Democratic representative in their lifetime.\n\nBut even more than that, they never thought that this particular Democrat would be leaning so forcefully into an impeachment inquiry against a Republican president.\n\nCasten is among those who\u2019ve been dubbed \u201cfrontliners\u201d by their party \u2014 freshman Democrats whose victories last year were a hallmark of the blue wave that wiped out suburban GOP incumbents and who face uphill re-election battles in 2020. Many frontliners tend to tiptoe around the politically thorny issues of the day like impeachment, knowing that their stance could make them a one-term lawmaker and, in turn, cause Democrats to lose their House majority.\n\nCasten has chosen a different route.\n\nThe soft-spoken lawmaker was one of the first vulnerable Democrats to come out in support of an impeachment inquiry. And despite the political risks, he is embracing it more than anyone on Capitol Hill right now.\n\nCasten, a 47-year-old former energy executive who ran on climate change, is a relatively unknown entity in Washington. He shuns the limelight and isn\u2019t a fixture on cable news like some of his fellow freshmen. But here in his C-shaped district west of Chicago, he has put himself in the spotlight more than any other first-term Democrat \u2014 in part because he knows it won\u2019t be easy to win again here in 2020.\n\nWhen I met up with him for an interview on Saturday morning, he had done 13 town hall events since taking office in January. By 8:30 p.m., that number stood at 19, after a grueling day crisscrossing the bellwether district and taking voters\u2019 questions for six hours.\n\nINTERACTIVE: See where House lawmakers stand on impeachment\n\nOver the summer recess, Casten held a town hall event focused exclusively on impeachment. Before lawmakers left Washington for the six-week break, he implored his fellow freshmen during a closed-door meeting to hold similar events. They all thought he was crazy.\n\nBut in some respects, that was to be expected for someone who came out in support of an impeachment inquiry against Trump in June. In fact, he was one of the first frontliners \u2014 along with Reps. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) and Katie Porter (D-Calif.) \u2014 to back such a process.\n\nWhen they were preparing to go public, the three of them asked to meet with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. They wanted to give her the courtesy, Casten said, because their support of formal impeachment proceedings had the potential to muddy Pelosi\u2019s cautious strategy at the time.\n\n\u201cTo her credit, she said, \u2018You don\u2019t need my permission; you just need to do the right thing for you,\u2019\u201d Casten told me, about the previously unreported meeting.\n\nPelosi stuck to her \u201cinvestigate, legislate, litigate\u201d strategy even as a majority of her caucus was supporting an impeachment inquiry. At the time, it was special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 and evidence he uncovered showing that Trump sought to obstruct the probe \u2014 that was driving Democrats to support formal proceedings.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until an entirely different scandal surfaced that Pelosi decided to finally embrace an impeachment inquiry. In the less than two weeks since she formalized the impeachment process, House investigators are rapidly intensifying their efforts to highlight what Democrats say is damning evidence that Trump abused his office to solicit foreign assistance to dig up dirt on his political rivals.\n\nThe end of September was an inconvenient time for lawmakers to leave Washington for a two-week recess, just days after Pelosi formalized the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and investigators began collecting evidence and subpoenaing witnesses in earnest. So it presented Casten and other vulnerable Democrats with a challenge as they face the music from voters back home.\n\nAt each of his events on Saturday, Casten emphasized what he called the \u201csomberness of this moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you, in your head, would celebrate impeachment or would celebrate exoneration, you\u2019ve got to straighten out your head,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to celebrate about the moment that we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been forced into this by the circumstances,\u201d he added.\n\nAfter a grueling stretch listening to voters grill Casten, here\u2019s what I learned about Democrats\u2019 months-long trod toward impeachment proceedings.\n\nYou can\u2019t move public opinion toward impeachment if you don\u2019t embrace it.\n\nFor Casten, the June meeting with Pelosi was prescient. He told the speaker that the polling on impeachment \u2014 which was abysmal at the time \u2014 was irrelevant to him until Democrats had a united front convincing the public that impeachment would be worth looking at.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get out there and educate the voters if they say, \u2018Well, given all of this stuff, why aren\u2019t you in favor of starting the impeachment process?\u2019\u201d Casten said. \u201cI said, well, basically, I want to get out to a point where I can educate the voters \u2014 and so that was really my motivation for coming out, because I wanted to be some force of education.\u201d\n\nCasten backed impeachment proceedings on June 20. Over the next three months, Pelosi stuck to her strategy, even as more of her Democratic colleagues broke ranks. The polling on impeachment remained stagnant \u2014 until two weeks ago, when the speaker reacted swiftly to Trump\u2019s admission that he asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s potential opponent in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last couple weeks is that once the party gets behind this, the polls move,\u201d Casten said. \u201cBecause at the end of the day, I think people are generally more motivated by truth than lies. But we haven\u2019t been out there telling that story.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nPelosi\u2019s critics \u2014 particularly those on the progressive left who have been girding for impeachment proceedings since the day Mueller\u2019s report was released \u2014 have touched on similar arguments in recent months to make the case that public support for impeachment wouldn\u2019t magically grow through House Judiciary Committee hearings on the legalese surrounding obstruction of justice. They accused Democratic leaders in particular of dithering as they failed to sustain momentum amid the White House\u2019s all-out blockade of subpoenas seeking documents and witness testimony, forcing House Democrats into the arduous and slow federal court system to seek compliance.\n\nIn the end, though, it took an entirely different scandal to get Pelosi to \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 one that has united Democrats in outrage and one that is markedly easier to portray as an impeachable offense.\n\n\u201cI find in this job, you can do the work in Washington. But you really can\u2019t move public opinion very much,\u201d Casten told me. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the district, you\u2019re not voting on stuff, you\u2019re not going into committee hearings. But you can move public opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the bully pulpit that I have is much more effective in the district than nationally right now,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the meantime, Democrats are trying \u2014 with varying degrees of success \u2014 to push back on Trump\u2019s unproven claims about Biden\u2019s efforts to remove a controversial Ukrainian prosecutor, and the president\u2019s fixation on a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nAt five of Casten\u2019s six town halls on Saturday, he was pressed on those claims.\n\nTrump\u2019s claims about Biden are resonating among his political base.\n\nThis one may come as no shocker, since the president\u2019s base of voters has remained loyal to him through scandal after scandal, transgression after transgression.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s efforts to paint Biden as corrupt for trying to oust a prosecutor who at one point was investigating a company tied to his son Hunter appeared to resonate among his supporters who attended Casten\u2019s town halls \u2014 some of whom were wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and \u201cTrump 2020\u201d t-shirts.\n\nCasten was prepared for those inquiries. Right off the bat at his first town hall here, a woman tore into Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, accusing them of \u201clying their little butts off\u201d and saying that a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine\u2019s president \u201clooks like a bunch of 13-year-old girls gossiping.\u201d\n\nConstituent Steven Wood and his wife accused Rep. Sean Casten of cheapening the political discourse by deriding Trump\u2019s immigration policies as \u201cracist\u201d and referring to Trump\u2019s claims about Biden as \u201ccrackpot conspiracy theories.\u201d | Andrew Desiderio/POLITICO\n\nAt an event later in the day in Bartlett, Ill., a constituent asked Casten why he wasn\u2019t condemning Biden\u2019s actions.\n\nIn both instances, Casten spoke for more than five minutes about the nitty-gritty of the claims Trump and his allies have made about Biden. He unapologetically declared that there was \u201cno \u2018there\u2019 there on the Biden story,\u201d and after hearing a question about the unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine was responsible for meddling in the 2016 election, he told the voter that she was espousing a \u201cdeep-down-the-rabbit-hole, crazy conspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nCasten\u2019s posture toward impeachment comes with real political risks.\n\nRepublicans have lost significant ground in districts like Casten\u2019s in the Trump era \u2014 districts that were once the anchor of the GOP. The party has struggled to retain support among suburban moderates, women and minorities in particular, and in 2018 the GOP lost many of these seats in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles .\n\nRepublicans\u2019 strategy for winning back the House in 2020 is to tie Democrats like Casten to the more progressive voices in his party and make the case that they are too extreme for their districts \u2014 from their support for impeachment to their rhetoric about the president.\n\nSo even though Democrats like Casten are confident in their pushback against Trump and his allies, the terrain in historically conservative districts like this one remains fraught with political landmines \u2014 ones that Casten tacitly acknowledged, even as he tore into Trump on issues completely unrelated to impeachment.\n\n\u201cIf the president screwed up, at the end of the day he\u2019s got to be gone,\u201d Steven Wood told me after confronting Casten as he was leaving his town hall in Fox River Grove, Ill.\n\nBut Wood remains convinced that Trump did nothing wrong, and he took issue with the way Casten described the president\u2019s claims about Biden, in particular his declarative statement that Trump and his supporters are \u201cactively suppressing facts.\u201d I witnessed the heated exchange, during which Wood and his wife accused Casten of cheapening the political discourse when he derided Trump\u2019s immigration policies as \u201cracist\u201d and referred to Trump\u2019s claims about Biden as \u201ccrackpot conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople who ignore their morals and their ethics in order to support something or ignore the facts to support a reprehensible morality, I\u2019m not going to pretend to \u2014 \u201d Casten told Wood as a staffer intervened to whisk him away to his next town hall.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/3257/1155968404_6091759372001_6091757354001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nCasten later told me that he\u2019s unapologetic about both his stances and his rhetoric because anything else would be a betrayal to his true self. At the same time, though, he risks alienating Republicans who might otherwise support him.\n\n\u201cThe partisan affiliation of the district is massively less relevant than the morality of the district,\u201d Casten said. \u201cI voted for George H.W. Bush. I voted for Bob Dole. I don\u2019t think my morals have changed. But I don\u2019t think those individuals are very well represented by the existing elected members of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would rather,\u201d he added, \u201cbe a politician who says, these are my non-negotiables, and if you like it, vote for me, and if you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t vote for me, than someone who says I\u2019ll be morally ambiguous and I\u2019ll just blow back and forth to wherever the public goes. Because that ain\u2019t me .\u201d\n\nHowever, Casten made some implicit overtures to Republicans each time he was confronted over the Ukraine scandal. At nearly all of the six town halls, he said there was at least one area in which Trump had done a better job than Barack Obama: his willingness to arm the Ukrainians with lethal defensive weapons as they fight back against Russia\u2019s aggressive incursions into Eastern Europe.\n\nDespite impeachment fervor, voters still care about policy agendas.\n\nImpeachment is all-consuming on cable news and in the national press \u2014 and for good reason. But many liberal voters across Illinois\u2019 6th Congressional District, while supportive of the impeachment effort, don\u2019t want policy priorities like gun control and climate change to take a back seat. At one of the town halls, impeachment didn\u2019t come up even once.\n\nGun-control legislation is still languishing amid Trump\u2019s apparent opposition to tightening background checks; the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement remains stalled amid negotiations with House Democrats; and lawmakers have yet to act on bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nIt\u2019s a reflection of Pelosi\u2019s long-held view that Democrats won control of the House in 2018 not because of impeachment, but because of their focus on kitchen-table issues like health care. Pelosi often reminds her members that they can walk and chew gum at the same time.\n\nTo be sure, at four of the six town halls, voters spent the majority of the session asking about issues related to impeachment. It\u2019s exactly what Casten expected, and he came prepared.\n\nEverybody loves hammering the media.\n\nCasten doesn\u2019t call the press \u201cfake news\u201d or the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d But at each town hall event, he singled out the national news media for portraying what he sees as a false narrative of what happens in Washington.\n\nIt\u2019s a common refrain at town halls across America \u2014 rural or urban, liberal or conservative, rich or poor.\n\nCasten knocked the media for what he sees as a portrayal of the Democratic Party as being controlled by the more progressive voices like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and others who, he quipped, \u201chave more Twitter followers than me.\u201d\n\nHe made the point that Democrats won back the House not because of lawmakers like Ocasio-Cortez who ran to the left of incumbents , but because of the 39 freshman Democrats who flipped Republican-held districts and tend to be centrists.\n\n\u201cThe part that I wish got more coverage,\u201d Casten told me when I asked about his media criticisms, \u201cis the fact that there is such massive ideological diversity in the Democratic Party, that it\u2019s a big enough tent to accommodate from AOC and Bernie Sanders out to Dan Lipinski and Joe Manchin, and it means that on almost every policy conversation we\u2019re having, the policy debate is happening in the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the other side of the aisle, you have from Peter King to Steve King,\u201d Casten said, referring to two well-known Republican congressmen, the latter of whom has been shunned by his party for racist rhetoric. \u201cThey all sing from the same hymnal because they only own one book. The era when the Republican Party was really engaged in ideas is gone.\u201d\n\nAt a town hall in Sleepy Hollow, Ill., a 69-year-old man pressed Casten to \u201cpush back on these crazies,\u201d referring to the progressive \u201csquad\u201d of Ocasio-Cortez and Reps. Ayann Pressley (D-Mass.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). In Glen Ellyn, Ill., another man confronted Casten about Omar\u2019s comments about Jewish people, which were criticized as being anti-Semitic.\n\nCasten drew applause when said that while he condemns \u201chorribly inappropriate\u201d remarks from members of his own party, \u201cwe are far too quick to condemn hatred when it comes out of a brown woman in a head scarf than we are when it comes out the mouth of a white supremacist.\u201d\n\nCasten might not like how those dynamics are portrayed on cable news, but his exchanges with voters who support the president almost felt like the heated cable news segments that sometimes go viral. Americans are having the same arguments at the local level, and it\u2019s yet another reflection of how polarized the political climate has become.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/21/f4/663a0c274015bbcc626ded8c9379/20191006-sean-casten-supporters-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
