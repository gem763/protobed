There were also goals from Reiss Nelson and Joe Willock, two academy graduates, as Unai Emery\u2019s side produced a complete performance against a strong Nottingham Forest team who had not lost since the opening day of the season.\n\nThere were also standout performances for Arsenal from Kieran Tierney, making a terrific debut after joining from Celtic, and from Calum Chambers, who created two goals from full-back positions.\n\nThe mood was lifted yet further by the return to action of Hector Bellerin, another long-term absentee. Bellerin created Willock\u2019s goal within minutes of entering the pitch as a second-half substitute.\n\n\u201cIt was the perfect opportunity for different players to take minutes and confidence,\u201d Emery said. \u201cThe game was very consistent for 90 minutes. Holding, Tierney and Bellerin all back from injuries with a good result and a good game. A clean sheet, lots of positive things. We can be positive.\u201d\n\nMartinelli struck the first after a sustained spell of pressure. He was picked out by a sensational cross from Chambers, who struck the ball as a mid-air volley, allowing the 18-year-old to steer a powerful header into the top corner.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cHe is a very young player,\u201d \u00adEmery said of the Brazilian. \u201cHe came here and we were waiting and watching how he could improve with us. He is hungry to have that opportunity to help us and his work tonight was perfect.\u201d\n\nThe second was scored by Holding, from Nelson\u2019s corner, just moments after the centre-back had taken the captain\u2019s armband from the substituted Mesut Ozil.\n\nThe arrival of Bellerin led to the third, with the Spaniard immediately teeing up Willock for a tap-in.\n\nNelson\u2019s goal followed another rampaging run by the excellent Chambers, now operating at left-back, before Martinelli secured a fifth with a long-range effort which was deflected into the top corner.\n\nMatch details\n\nArsenal (4-2-3-1): Martinez 6; Chambers 8, Mustafi 6, Holding 7, Tierney 8 (Bellerin 77); Torreira 6, Willock 7; Smith Rowe 6 (Saka 44), Ozil 7 (Ceballos 71), Nelson 7; Martinelli 7\n\nSubstitutes not used: Macey, Balogun, Bola, Burton\n\nBooked: Nelson\n\n\n\n\n\nNottingham Forest (4-5-1): Muric 5; Cash 4, Figueiredo 4, Rodriguez 4, Robinson 5; Lolley 5 (Gabriel 81), Johnson 5, Silva 4, Carvalho 5 (Ameobi 59), Ribeiro 4 (Mighten 78); Adomah 5\n\nSubstitutes not used: Smith, Milosevic, Grabban, Sow\n\n\n\nReferee: Darren England\n\nAttendance: 53,160\n\n", "description": "An invigorating combination of fresh faces and returning favourites guided Arsenal to a straightforward League Cup victory over Nottingham Forest, with Rob Holding scoring on his comeback from knee injury and teenage forward Gabriel Martinelli striking his first two goals for the club.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hGuFq1hAI3u3UE60kBj01A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oC3qkIK6LmmsmYf.mDTYQg--~B/aD0xNTY0O3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/708bc9a23361be3935f01f246d856931", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
