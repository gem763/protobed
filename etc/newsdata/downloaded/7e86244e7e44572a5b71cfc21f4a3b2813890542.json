The next point of engagement will be in the voting lobbies.\u201d\n\nThe former cabinet ministers supporting a cross-party bid to stop no deal fought back on Sunday night, telling MPs they must be prepared to take the government to court if it defied any law passed by rebel MPs in parliament.\n\nThe threat was prompted by a suggestion from Michael Gove that the government may not feel bound by the legislation.\n\nBrexit: Gove refuses to rule out ignoring any law passed to stop no deal Read more\n\nAhead of a historic week in parliament, a fierce briefing war erupted across the Conservative party as whips convened for Sunday lunch with Johnson at the prime minister\u2019s country retreat at Chequers, agreeing that any Conservative MP who voted on the rebel legislation would have the whip withdrawn and become ineligible to stand for the party.\n\n\u201cThe whips are telling Conservative MPs today a very simple message \u2013 if they fail to vote with the government on Tuesday they will be destroying the government\u2019s negotiating position and handing control of parliament to Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d said a senior source in the whips\u2019 office source. \u201cAny Conservative MP who does this will have the whip withdrawn and will not stand as a Conservative candidate in an election.\u201d\n\nQ&A What does 'prorogue parliament' mean? Show Hide Prorogation is the official term that marks the end of a parliamentary session. After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen\u2019s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills that have been passed during that session and summarises what has been achieved. It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament. Parliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen\u2019s speech at the formal state opening of parliament.\n\nNo 10 believes the nuclear threat of deselection, and its unprecedented consequence of removing the whip of a former chancellor and justice secretary just weeks after they left government, has a serious chance of spooking MPs and wiping the majority for any no-deal legislation in parliament.\n\nGovernment sources conceded that the practical reality of removing the whip from a significant number of MPs could inevitably lead to a general election.\n\nWithout more than 20 MPs currently planning to vote against the government, it would be impossible for Johnson to manage in minority government.\n\n\u201cFor a government that has a majority of one which has repeatedly said it does not want an election, to then threaten to deselect 20 MPs, well it suggests that it is not the case,\u201d one prominent rebel said.\n\nThe whips\u2019 office source said the seriousness of the threat was to underline that MPs would be deliberately scuppering the chance of a Brexit deal. \u201cThere is a chance of a deal on 17 October only because Brussels realises the prime minister is totally committed to leaving on 31 October,\u201d the source said.\n\nEx-ministers, including Hammond and Gauke, voiced outrage at the threat, calling it hypocrisy that a cabinet with eight former rebels at its heart could then threaten MPs with deselection.\n\nA source close to the MPs under threat of deselection said they would not be deterred: \u201cThis is sheer hypocrisy. Almost a quarter of the current cabinet have voted against the party whip. But this is about the national interest, and we\u2019ve moved beyond the point where threats will persuade people to abandon their principles.\u201d\n\nThe suggestion by Gove that the government could defy the law also sparked fury from MPs, including one former Tory minister who said it showed democracy was under threat from Johnson\u2019s government.\n\nOne source close to the group of ex-ministers said Gove\u2019s comments underlined the urgency of passing the bill this week, to allow time for legal action if the government rejected the new law or if Johnson refused to follow its direction to seek an extension to the Brexit deadline.\n\n\u201cThis legislation will need to be taken to the courts if the government decides not to abide by it,\u201d a senior source close to the Conservative rebels said. \u201cThat is precisely why we have to act next week. In October, we will not have enough time. It is literally now or never.\u201d\n\nA bill which would mandate another extension of article 50 has been drafted which senior sources said would go into more detail about the length of an extension \u2013 unlike the previous law passed by Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin which did not specify a timeframe.\n\nLetwin is expected to lead the bill\u2019s presentation, though the effort has been closely coordinated with the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer and the Labour frontbench. On Tuesday, MPs are expected to immediately ask the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, for an emergency debate under the standing order 24 rule, debates which traditionally end with a neutral motion.\n\nHowever, rebels hope the Speaker will allow a vote on a motion to set aside Wednesday for MPs to take control of the Commons order paper to pass a bill through all stages in the Commons.\n\nCorbyn will convene a meeting of the shadow cabinet on Monday to outline the plans, saying Labour will do \u201ceverything necessary to pull our country back from the brink\u201d.\n\nStarmer said the bill would be \u201ca very short, simple exercise designed to ensure we don\u2019t crash out without a deal,\u201d saying the length of an extension was a \u201csecondary\u201d concern.\n\n\u201cIt will be as simple as it possibly can be,\u201d said one source close to the cross-party talks. \u201cThat is the only way to keep the coalition together.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Gove repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility that the government could ignore any law passed by parliament to stop a no-deal Brexit. \u201cLet\u2019s see what the legislation says,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me about a pig in a poke.\u201d\n\nStarmer called for Johnson to make an urgent statement on Gove\u2019s comments. \u201cFor ministers not to confirm that this government will accept and comply with legislation lawfully passed is breathtaking,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe Conservative MP Guto Bebb, a supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said Gove had shown the \u201cour very democracy is now under threat from Boris Johnson and his government\u201d.\n\nMPs who have been now been denied the meeting with Johnson said they had planned to challenge the prime minister on the need to devise a concrete proposal for a new deal and demanded a positive reaction from the EU in order to be convinced of Johnson\u2019s sincerity.\n\n\u201cWe are now less than three weeks away from the 30-day deadline for an alternative to the backstop,\u201d said a source close to the group. \u201cThis is a group who are all reconciled that the best outcome is a Brexit deal. They genuinely want to see helpful signs \u2013 so is the prime minister able to give them new, concrete evidence that a deal is in play?\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Sky News, Gauke said he hoped that Johnson would not follow through with threats to withdraw the whip but suggested it would not change his mind.\n\n\u2018Get Ready for Brexit\u2019: government launches information blitz Read more\n\n\u201cSometimes there is a point where ... you have to judge between your own personal interests and the national interest. And the national interest has to come first,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut, I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that, and I hope cooler and calmer heads will look at this and think that trying to split the Conservative party in this way is not a sensible way forward for the Conservative party, or indeed for the country.\u201d\n\nFormer Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt and former health minister Stephen Hammond \u2013 both of whom have made clear they will vote for measures to stop no deal \u2013 also voiced fury at the threat.\n\nBurt said he had \u201cloyally supported\u201d Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement and voted three times to leave the EU, unlike members of the current cabinet like Jacob Rees-Mogg. \u201cWhy am I now being threatened and not them?\u201d he tweeted.", "description": "Rebel Tories face deselection over Brexit, as PM abruptly cancels meeting with group including ex-ministers", "authors": ["Jessica Elgot"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06875eb543cfcd617a34575de6ef8d7f3e711a06/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a7c02b3ba2ee37acfcac3c1d56eb7848"}
