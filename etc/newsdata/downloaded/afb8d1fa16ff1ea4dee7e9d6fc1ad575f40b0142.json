Absolutely. No question about that. But that's it, and that's why we held up the money,\" Mulvaney said during the conference.\n\nAfter the press briefing, Mulvaney walked back his previous remarks, claiming that the media had \"misconstrued\" his comments \"to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump,\" adding, Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\"\n\n\"The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\"\n\nRead more: Mick Mulvaney tries to claw back his confirmation \u2014 made on live TV \u2014 that Trump threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine to secure political dirt on Democrats\n\nThe whistleblower said that in a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump used \"the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\"\n\nThe complaint detailed concerns how Trump used the call with Zelensky to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son days after withholding a nearly $400 million military-aid package.\n\nBiden's son, Hunter, served on the board of Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma Holdings from 2014 to 2019. Trump and his allies have falsely accused Biden of using his power as vice president to urge Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma in order to protect Hunter.\n\nA memo summarizing the call released by the White House confirmed the substance of the whistleblower's complaint. It showed that after telling Zelensky that \"we do a lot\" for Ukraine in terms of military support, Trump asked him for \"a favor\" by investigating Hunter Biden's business dealings and helping to discredit the Russia probe by investigating a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine was somehow in possession of the DNC's server.\n\nAsking a foreign government for material campaign aid is not only unprecedented from a president, but it could even violate campaign finance laws against soliciting aid from foreign nationals.\n\nAnd if Trump did, in fact, use military aid as a bargaining chip \u2014 as Mulvaney might have suggested he did \u2014 he could also be impeached on charges of extortion and misappropriation of taxpayer funds.\n\nHere's a lightly-edited transcript of Mulvaney's back-and-forth over the administration's withholding of aid so you can decide for yourself:\n\nABC News White House correspondent Jon Karl: \"To the question of Ukraine, can you clarify, was the president serious when he said he also would like to see China investigate the Bidens? And you were directly involved in the decision to withhold funding from Ukraine. Can you explain to us now definitively why the funding was withheld?\"\n\nMulvaney: \"It came as no surprise to anybody \u2014 I haven't done this since I was chief of staff, the last time I was up here was for the budget briefings, right? Something you all asked me was, 'what are you doing with the foreign aid, since we absolutely gutted it, right'? President Trump isn't a big fan of foreign aid: never has been, still isn't. He doesn't like spending money overseas, especially when it's poorly spent. And that is exactly what drove this decision. I've been in the office with him talking with him a couple of times and he says, 'Mick, this is a corrupt place, everybody knows this is a corrupt place.'", "description": "Trump is currently facing an impeachment inquiry over allegations that he used the power of the office to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democrats.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xYH97xEVpv9aWFkEqZ_NnA--~B/aD0xNDA3O3c9MTg3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/9d965185e4172a090bf83f07fa849640", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
