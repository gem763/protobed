Maybe that is just what happens when you become so accustomed to making history every time you race.\n\nIn helping Britain to world 4x100m silver in Doha, she became the first British athlete ever to win three medals at a global championships. Her final haul is a gold (200m) and two silvers (100m and 4x100m) - not a bad week\u2019s work for the 23-year-old.\n\nThe latest silver was one of two won by Britain on the penultimate day of competition, with the men\u2019s 4x100m team breaking their own national record despite being forced to relinquish their title by a rampant American team. That takes the British medal total up to five, of which Asher-Smith has contributed more than half. A useful team member to have then.\n\n\u201cAs British sprinters, we\u2019ve never been rated and Dina\u2019s paved the way,\u201d said Asha Philip, who led off the relay quartet. \u201cShe\u2019s putting us on the map.\u201d", "description": "Having already broken countless records over the past week, perhaps it is no surprise Dina Asher-Smith was unaware of the latest one after winning yet another silver medal on Saturday night.", "authors": ["Ben Bloom", "Athletics Correspondent", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000212134492-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8Asj1eHb3tSpQqwok7bWe8yDCL9C1pUixbxwqFPQ8Uw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
