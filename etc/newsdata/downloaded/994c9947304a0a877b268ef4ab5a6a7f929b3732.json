(AP) - The New Orleans Saints kept their sights set on a Super Bowl even after Drew Brees went down with an injury.\n\nWhile their superstar quarterback continues to recover following thumb surgery, the NFC South leaders will try to remain unbeaten without him.\n\nThe Saints look to improve to 5-0 with Teddy Bridgewater as their starter in Brees\u2018 place when they visit Khalil Mack and the Chicago Bears on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt just shows this is a team that\u2019s determined to win and do whatever it takes,\u201d Bridgewater said.\n\nThe Saints (5-1) are getting big contributions from their defense and special teams and enough from their offense even if they\u2019re not moving the ball the way they did a year ago. They\u2019re averaging 344.7 yards - down 34.5 yards per game from last season, when Brees made 15 starts. He\u2019s been sidelined since he tore a ligament in his right thumb during a loss to the Los Angeles Rams in Week 2.\n\nBridgewater has completed about 69 percent of his passes for 1,089 yards, seven touchdowns and two interceptions. He wasn\u2019t as effective last week at Jacksonville, after throwing for 314 yards and four touchdowns against Tampa Bay, but he hit Jared Cook for a tiebreaking 4-yard TD early in the fourth quarter against the Jaguars.\n\nHe will try to keep the Saints rolling against a team looking to bounce back. The Bears (3-2) are coming off a loss to Oakland in London two weeks ago in which their defense got pushed around a bit after dominating the first four games and their offense continued to struggle.\n\nHere are some things to know:\n\nTRUBISKY\u2019S RETURN\n\nThe Bears hope to get quarterback Mitchell Trubisky back after missing a game because of a left shoulder injury.\n\nIf he returns, he\u2019ll try to build on a promising showing against Washington in Week 3.\n\nTrubisky threw three touchdowns in an easy win over the struggling Redskins after mediocre outings in a season-opening loss to Green Bay and a narrow victory at Denver. He was then injured on the opening drive against Minnesota on Sept. 29.\n\n\u201cI felt that each game leading up to that Vikings game, until he got hurt, that there was (improvement),\u201d Bears coach Matt Nagy said. \u201cProgression-wise where he\u2019s going, playing faster, seeing at the line of scrimmage that he\u2019s getting into checks or seeing progressions, adjustments at the line of scrimmage - way quicker than what he was.\u201d\n\nVeteran Chase Daniel figures to make his second straight start if Trubisky is unavailable.\n\nGETTING PRESSURE\n\nWith 18 sacks, New Orleans is tied with Green Bay and Tennessee for sixth in the NFL.\n\nCoach Sean Payton has been pleased by how depth along the front has helped keep linemen fresh and pressure high. While Cameron Jordan leads the club with five sacks, he\u2019s one of eight defensive linemen who\u2019ve had at least half a sack. Payton said the Saints put an emphasis on improving depth on the defensive line after defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins, who was second on the club in sacks last season with eight, tore his Achilles tendon last January. That helped the Saints remain stout up front until Rankins returned in Week 4.\n\nThe Saints have not allowed a 100-yard rusher this season - or in 32 games, for that matter. They\u2019ve also held their previous three opponents - Dallas, Tampa Bay and Jacksonville - to season lows in total yards.\n\nINJURED PLAYERS\n\nWhile the Saints could be thin at running back if Alvin Kamara is unavailable or limited because of knee and ankle injuries, the Bears placed right guard Kyle Long and defensive tackle Akiem Hicks on injured reserve this week.\n\nLong will miss the remainder of the season with a hip injury. Hicks could return after eight weeks from an elbow injury he suffered against Oakland. Both players have made the Pro Bowl - Long from 2013-15 and Hicks last year.\n\nRISING ROOKIE\n\nSaints rookie defensive back C.J. Gardner-Johnson has had a promising start to his career. And he is expected to be tested more this week because primary nickel back P.J. Williams was suspended two games for violating the NFL\u2019s substance abuse policy.\n\nJohnson\u2019s biggest moment was a hit on Cowboys QB Dak Prescott on a delayed blitz that forced an interception on the final play of the Saints\u2018 12-10 triumph over Dallas in Week 4.\n\nDEFERENCE TO DANIEL\n\nWhile the Saints weren\u2019t sure which quarterback they\u2019d be facing, several spoke highly of former teammate Daniel.\n\nRankins said Daniel - who played for New Orleans from 2009-12 and in 2017 - was always respected by the Saints\u2018 offensive brain trust: Payton and Brees.\n\n\u201cCoaches respected his opinion if he had an opinion on certain plays, or Drew would go to him about certain things, or they would converse back and forth about things they were seeing on the field,\u201d recalled Rankins, who was Daniel\u2019s teammate in 2017.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Brett Martel in New Orleans contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New Orleans Saints kept their sights set on a Super Bowl even after Drew Brees went down with an injury.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Seligman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/saints_jaguars_football_94064_c0-128-3107-1940_s1200x700.jpg?97c697aa19e587a947e9fc8d799402812964b3cf", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
