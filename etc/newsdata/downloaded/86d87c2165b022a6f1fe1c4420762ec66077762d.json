The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) had forecast a 0.5% quarterly and 1.3% year-on-year rate of inflation.\n\nThe annual increase in inflation was driven by higher prices for rents, cigarettes and tobacco, the agency said in a statement. The quarterly CPI increase was due to price rises for local authority rates and payments, vegetables, and meat and poultry, it said.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar rose 0.25% to $0.6308 after the inflation data as dovish traders eased some of their bets.\n\nHowever, the data did little to change the market view that RBNZ would cut rates again this year to boost an economy facing headwinds from global uncertainty and a slowdown in activity and business confidence.\n\nKiwibank Chief Economist Jarrod Kerr said in a note that while today's data was above expectation, RBNZ still needs to do more and he expects a rate cut in November.\n\nThe central bank kept the official cash rate (OCR) at a record low of 1.0% last month, after stunning markets with a steep 50 basis-point rate cut in August.\n\nRBNZ has said the reduction in the OCR this year was needed to ensure inflation increases to the 2% mid-point of its target 1-3% range, and employment remains around its maximum sustainable level.\n\n\"Today's data just reduces the case that the RBNZ needs to put all 50 bps of stimulus through in November as market pricing has recently suggested was a possibility \u2013 albeit a slim one,\" said Kerr.\n\nMarkets are now pricing an 87% chance of a rate cut by 25 basis points at RBNZ's next meeting on Nov. 13.", "description": "New Zealand inflation quickens in third quarter, but rate cut view stays", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9E21Y_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
