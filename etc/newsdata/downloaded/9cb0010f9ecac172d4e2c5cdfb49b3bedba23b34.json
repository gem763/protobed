Both are now less than 1% off their July all-time highs. The Nasdaq Composite index COMP, +1.06% is less than 2% off its record peak, and the small-cap Russell 2000 index RUT, +2.12% and the bellwether Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.83% , which lagged the other averages, have rallied sharply in recent weeks.\n\nThis comes amid worries about yield curve inversions, recession (60% of Americans think one\u2019s coming in the next 12 months, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll), trade tensions, negative interest rates in Europe and Japan, and slumping global economies.\n\nBut U.S. traders and investors never got the memo. That stocks can stay so strong even before we enter the historically best six months for stocks (November through April) of the calendar year tells me they\u2019re poised to move higher, at least in the months ahead, for three reasons:\n\n1. Recession may be coming, but it isn\u2019t right around the corner. A few weeks ago, when the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -3.66% dropped below the yield on the two-year Treasury TMUBMUSD02Y, -3.12% for about 6\u00bd minutes, the media covered this momentous event as if it were the Normandy invasion. But it lasted only three trading days, according to Treasury Department data, signifying nothing.\n\nWhat the media missed (except for this column) was that the real yield curve inversion, discovered by Duke University Professor Campbell Harvey, is the spread between the three-month Treasury bill and the 10-year note, a measure that has correctly \u201ccalled\u201d the last seven recessions. Since that yield curve was inverted for the entire second quarter of 2019, Harvey has now put out a recession \u201cred alert,\u201d meaning that the chances of recession are now 40% or higher.\n\nBut the average lag between a full inversion and recession is 11 to 12 months, meaning any U.S. recession probably won\u2019t hit until the second half of 2020. Meanwhile, consumer confidence remains strong and GDP growth is OK, at about 2% in the second quarter. Looser monetary policy or any respite from the trade war (see below) might stave off the inevitable until 2021, giving stocks some breathing room to move higher.\n\n2. The Federal Reserve will keep cutting interest rates whether it wants to or not. President Trump just tweeted that he wants the Fed to cut rates to zero or lower. That\u2019s ridiculous, of course \u2014 do we really want to have negative rates like Europe or Japan? \u2014 and Fed officials will do everything they can to look as if they\u2019re independent of the president\u2019s moods and whims.\n\nRead: Dear Mr. President, why is it a good thing if a 10-year Treasury note is worth less than a bag of dirt?\n\nBut the overwhelming logic of Fed policy is to keep cutting rates, even as it tries to control the pace and the narrative. The weakness in the global economy and efforts by other central banks to fight it \u2014 Lawrence McDonald of Bear Traps Report says there have been 32 rate cuts this year by central banks globally (prior to Thursday\u2019s rate cut by the European Central Bank), and markets have priced in 58 more rate cuts \u2014 will keep the heat on the Fed as Chairman Jay Powell starts worrying more about falling \u201cbehind the curve.\u201d\n\nWhatever the reason, rate cuts are bullish for stocks and investors are looking for more of them.\n\nRead: ECB cuts key rate, restarts quantitative easing as it attempts to revive eurozone economy\n\n3. Investors expect Trump to fold on trade. Algorithms may cause stock markets to sell off when the president puts out bellicose tweets, but investors have taken their measure of the man and they think that rather than risk re-election, he\u2019s going to ultimately cave in to China and end the trade war. Why? Because he\u2019s folded on so many things before \u2014 from threatening \u201cfire and fury\u201d against North Korea to embracing bromance buddy Kim Jong Un even as \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d has tested at least 18 missiles since May; from indirectly boasting he could kill 10 million people in Afghanistan to planning to meet the Taliban at Camp David days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He\u2019s already caved in to China so much it\u2019s hard to take the Capitulator-in-Chief\u2019s threats seriously.\n\nThat\u2019s why the smart money is looking for a cosmetic trade deal some time next year that includes some modest Chinese concessions but no major givebacks on critical issues like technology policy, which China views as a vital national interest. The president will declare any agreement a great victory, and traders will just wink as stocks move higher.\n\nRead: Trump delays tariff hikes against China until Oct. 15\n\nAt least that\u2019s what they\u2019re counting on, especially as the president\u2019s approval ratings slip and the economy weakens as we head into the 2020 election year.\n\nHoward R.
