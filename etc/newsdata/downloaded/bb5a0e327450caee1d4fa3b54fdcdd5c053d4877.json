Hadid gently guided her away from the scene.\n\nBenoliel\u2019s motive for the incident appears to be nothing more than attention-grabbing, which is the M.O. of all YouTubers, but the incident has drawn attention to the event\u2019s actual security detail.\n\nVideo from the scene shows a couple of tuxed-up seccies looking slightly flummoxed by the situation.\n\nBest @chanel finale video ever: Spot the catwalk- crasher! And spot the security guys running after her! #PFW pic.twitter.com/Wztgsj3jVq \u2014 Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) October 1, 2019\n\nIn a statement obtained by CNN, Benoliel said \u201cGigi was quite nervous by all means and reacted quite aggressively to me. She clearly did not understand my comic approach.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Chanel added \u201cThis person is a comedian known for this type of prank.\n\n\u201cShe had crashed another runway recently. Her presence on the catwalk was not planned. Security guards simply led her to the exit at the end of the show.\u201d\n\nThere have been no reports of Benoliel facing repercussions for staunching up to Hadid, but being a person who considers this kind of thing \u2018satire\u2019 is probably punishment enough.", "description": "YouTuber Marie S'Infiltre hopped onto the runway, because that's what YouTubers do.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/gigi-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
