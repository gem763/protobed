Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is gaining traction and getting a fresh look from voters. The latest poll from Iowa shows her inching ahead of Biden. Voters may think Biden isn\u2019t just too old to be president, but that maybe he carries too much baggage to be the party\u2019s nominee, as well. In the strangest of ways, the whistleblower incident is more likely to end the political career of Biden before that of Trump.\n\nBiden is a fragile front-runner and the whole matter involving his son\u2019s foreign business dealings not only raises unflattering questions but provides plenty of reminders about his life in the swamp. Trump, on the other hand, is exceptionally durable with his base, to say nothing of the fact that his entire presidency has practically been defined by his ability to outlive Democratic \u201cwitch hunts.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Ed Rogers", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions How-Whistleblower-Complaint-Will-Affect-Election"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
