Ten candidates will be on hand to have their say. Voters are not keen on the idea.\n\n\u201cMost voters \u2014 including a majority of Democratic primary voters \u2014 still believe there will be too many candidates on the stage,\u201d reports a new Politico/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday.\n\nIt found that 54% of all voters say that the number of White House hopefuls \u201cis more than enough.\u201d The survey found that 53% of Democratic voters agree with that.\n\nThere is some tolerance here, though. A third of Democratic primary voters say the debate stage will have \u201cjust the right amount of candidates.\u201d\n\nThe stage likely will be more crowded in the future.\n\n\u201cVoters already unhappy with the size of the debate stage on Thursday are set to be disappointed: Eleven candidates have already qualified for the next debate in October, with several more on the fringes,\u201d noted a Politico analysis of the future event.\n\n\u201cThis virtually ensures that there will be either a larger stage or a second night of debates, as the DNC has previously said it does not plan to feature more than 10 candidates on the same debate stage,\u201d the analysis said.\n\nThe Politico/Morning Consult poll was conducted Sept. 7-8 online among a national sample of 1,998 registered voters\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
