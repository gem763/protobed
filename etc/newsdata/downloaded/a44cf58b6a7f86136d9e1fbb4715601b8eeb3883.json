Go look back at some of the stories written when Tony Romo retired. It was assumed he\u2019d return to the Dallas Cowboys. That hasn\u2019t happened.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt\u2019s not a surprise that people figure Gronkowski will come out of retirement to play tight end for the New England Patriots again. And maybe he will. We didn\u2019t figure Jason Witten would come back after a year in the \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d booth.\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 owner hasn\u2019t given up that dream.\n\nRob Gronkowski hasn\u2019t filed retirement papers\n\nRobert Kraft said on NFL Network before his Patriots played the New York Giants on Thursday night that he still wants Gronkowski to come back and play.\n\n\u201cWe all love Gronk and I think the bottom line is, he hasn\u2019t put his retirement papers in,\u201d Kraft told NFL Network. \u201cSo we can always pray and hope.\n\n\u201cThere is hope for us still with Gronk.\u201d\n\nMost NFL fans aren\u2019t going to pray and hope Gronkowski comes back to make the Patriots even better, but folks in New England might.\n\nIt is a little curious that Gronkowski hasn\u2019t filed retirement papers. Then again, it\u2019s Gronk. Maybe he just forgot.\n\nGronkowski could fill a hole for Pats\n\nGronkowski looks much thinner than when he played, and that\u2019s a sign he doesn\u2019t plan to come back. Also, when he retired he cited the physical pounding he took during his career. He wouldn\u2019t avoid that if he played again.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, the allure of coming back to a team that is clearly a contender to make another Super Bowl has to be strong. The Patriots still haven\u2019t figured out their tight end situation. It\u2019s not like Gronkowski wouldn\u2019t immediately be the best tight end on the roster the moment he came out of retirement.\n\nWe know now that the Patriots would love to have him back, not that there was much doubt about that.\n\nThe Patriots haven't given up hope that Rob Gronkowski plays again.
