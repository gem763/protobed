I am reluctant to look elsewhere \u2013 but the temptation is growing\n\nI have been in a very happy relationship for seven years. We are middle-aged and used to have an enthusiastic and satisfying sex life. With the menopause, however, my partner\u2019s sex drive has hit zero. She has no interest in intimacy and can see no change in the future. She has said I should find someone else to satisfy that part of my life, and has repeated this a number of times. I am reluctant to do so, but the temptation is growing stronger. A further complicating factor is my uncertain future, as I am recovering from cancer treatment. I fear I am entering a minefield, with potential disaster wherever I go.\n\n\u2022 When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
