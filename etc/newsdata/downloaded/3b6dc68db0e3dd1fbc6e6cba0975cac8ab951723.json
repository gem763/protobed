But in a separate editorial that accompanied the article, two obstetricians warned that broadly distributing blood thinners \u201cnot justified by the available data, and has the very real potential of doing more harm than good.\u201d Following the recommendation, they said, would cost $130 million and could result in severe bleeding in thousands of women.\n\nDr. Adam Urato, chief of maternal-fetal medicine at MetroWest Medical Center in Massachusetts, was one of the doctors who raised concerns about the new recommendation, and the pressure to implement it. When he investigated the organization, he discovered that NPMS, operating under the auspices of a group of prominent physicians, actually had significant ties to pharmaceutical companies, some of which made blood thinners. The 2016 recommendation did not disclose this conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an uncontrolled experiment on women who just [had] a baby,\u201d Shannon Brownlee, Lown Institute senior vice president, said.\n\nAuthors of the article defend the recommendation, saying the advice is safe and effective, the Journal reported.\n\nThree years after the recommendation first ran, Obstetrics & Gynecology published a correction; however, it did not name any of the companies that are linked to NPMS, nor did it appear in the online version. According to the Journal, the company names will appear on Thursday in the official publication of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, when it publishes a letter from nearly 50 physicians.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that obstetric providers, pregnant women, and the public be informed that the National Partnership is funded by three companies that manufacture or sell anticoagulants\u2014companies who would directly benefit financially from the approach they recommend,\u201d the draft letter said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Nearly one-third of births in the U.S. are by C-Section, meaning roughly 1.3 million women a year would be placed on blood thinners.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/12/0/0/pregnancy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
