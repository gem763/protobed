REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won/File Photo\n\nOil prices surged nearly a fifth at one point following the strikes on two plants, including the world\u2019s biggest petroleum processing facility in Abqaiq, which knocked out more than 5% of global oil supply.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility for the damage, but the U.S. has pointed the finger directly at Iran.\n\nThe Canadian dollar CAD=D3 rose 0.4% to 1.3233 per dollar. The Norwegian krone NOK= rose 0.5% to 8.9363 per dollar. Both currencies often move together with the oil price because the countries are major oil exporters.\n\nIn India, a major importer of crude, the rupee INR= fell almost 0.7%.\n\n\u201cThe natural flow through of higher (oil) prices has seen the NOK and the CAD outperform, and we\u2019ll probable see a better feel towards the (Russian) rouble later on,\u201d said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone Group in Melbourne.\n\nThe attacks reversed last week\u2019s ebullient risk appetite and prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to tweet that the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a response.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a beady eye on this and we\u2019re prepared to pile back in to the Japanese yen after last week\u2019s repositioning,\u201d Weston said, adding that while trade was calm, the strikes presented another geopolitical \u201cwhat if\u201d to vex markets.\n\nThe safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc both firmed. The yen JPY=EBS rose 0.3% to 107.79 per dollar and the franc rose 0.4% CHF= to $0.9883. Gold XAU= jumped by 1%.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies .DXY the dollar edged lower to 98.162.\n\nBeyond oil, currency markets are awaiting the outcome of central bank meetings in the U.S. and Japan this week and economic data in Australia and New Zealand that could determine the rates outlook in the Antipodes.\n\n\u201cGeopolitical risks and central bank rhetoric remain key drivers of risk this week,\u201d Australia and New Zealand Banking Group analysts said in a note.\n\nOn the Brexit front, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s confidence of sealing a deal to leave the European Union by Oct. 31 applied renewed pressure to the pound.\n\nSterling GBP=D3 fell 0.3 from a seven-week high to hit $1.2486.\n\nWhile much of the risk appetite on display last week was driven by signs of a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions, few fresh indications of progress left sentiment fragile.\n\nData released on Monday showed the slowdown in China\u2019s economy deepened in August, with industrial production growing at its weakest pace in 17-1/2 years and retail sales weaker than anticipated.\n\nThat added to pressure for stimulus and in offshore trade the Chinese yuan CNH= weakened 0.25% to 7.0631 per dollar.\n\nIn the United States, investors who had begun trimming expectations for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut on Wednesday are now certain rates will fall and divided only over how much.\n\nAs for the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy decision on Thursday, a third of economists polled by Reuters expect stimulus to be ramped up. But sources say it may be a close call as policymakers wait till the last minute to assess market reaction to the Fed\u2019s decision hours earlier.\n\nJapanese markets are closed on Monday for a public holiday.\n\nThe euro EUR=D3 was steady at $1.1073.", "description": "The dollar fell while safe havens and currencies of oil-producing countries rallied on Monday, following an attack on Saudi Arabian refining facilities that disrupted global oil supply and heightened Middle East tensions.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430273046&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F00D", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
