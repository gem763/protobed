That metric is on a healthier trajectory, sporting accelerating growth over the past three quarters.\n\nSnap earnings: Riding the Android redesign to grow its user base\n\nThe count is expected to rise once again when Twitter announces its third-quarter numbers, though at a familiar pace. RBC\u2019s Mark Mahaney sees the company reporting 14% year-over-year growth in monetizable daily active users, the same growth rate it posted three months back. \u201cWe would view an acceleration beyond 14% growth as a positive result,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect from Twitter\u2019s report:\n\nWhat to expect\n\nEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet are calling for 20 cents in adjusted earnings per share, compared with 21 cents in the year-ago quarter. According to Estimize, which crowd sources projections from hedge funds, academics, and others, the average estimate calls for 23 cents EPS.\n\nRevenue: The FactSet consensus models $874 million in third-quarter revenue, while the Estimize consensus calls for $883 million. Twitter generated $758 million in quarterly revenue a year back.\n\nStock movement: Twitter shares have risen following six of the company\u2019s last 10 earnings reports. The stock tends to make big swings the day the company issues its numbers, moving by 7% or more in all but one of the past 10 quarters. Shares are up 35% so far in 2019, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.28% has gained 20%.\n\n\n\nOf the 44 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover Twitter\u2019s stock, 14 have buy ratings, 24 have hold ratings, and five have sell ratings. The average price target listed is $42.74, 10% above recent levels.\n\nWhat else to watch for\n\nOn user growth, analysts are calling for about 3 million new monetizable daily active users, bringing the company\u2019s total up to 142 million. The company added 5 million three months back.\n\nOne important issue on Twitter\u2019s conference call will be the company\u2019s commentary around its move to do away with older ad types.\n\n\u201cWe expect a deceleration in ad revenue growth in Q3 due to the company\u2019s decision to phase out several legacy ad formats (which could cause some advertiser budget dislocation in the short-run) and tougher comps, but data licensing revenue should see an acceleration in Q3, driving 12% total year-over-year revenue growth,\u201d wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Maria Ripps, who rates the stock a hold with a $46 target. She\u2019ll also be watching for updates on Twitter\u2019s attempts to root out bad activity on the platform.\n\nSee also: Twitter to keep treating politicians differently when it comes to content violations\n\nMichael Pachter of Wedbush is calling for \u201ccontinued momentum\u201d with some of Twitter\u2019s new ad formats, which include the video website card and video app card. These let users click through to discover more about a product after viewing a video advertisement. He\u2019ll also be looking to gauge the impact of recent attempts to aid users in the discovery of new content.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of Q3, the company began rolling out changes to its desktop layout more broadly to more prominently feature relevant trends, events, and accounts based on existing user interests, along with streamlined navigation and onboarding,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn our checks we have observed improving relevance among suggested accounts to follow over the past couple quarters, which should translate to better retention and engagement growth.\u201d\n\nPachter rates Twitter\u2019s stock at neutral with a $42 price target.\n\nThe company may also provide some initial commentary on the year ahead.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s who America\u2019s CEOs are backing in the Democratic presidential race\n\n\u201cTwitter has a heavy event slate in 2020 with the presidential election and the Olympics in Japan which should support revenue growth globally, so the fundamental picture looks bright,\u201d wrote Barclays analyst Ross Sandler, who has an underweight rating and $34 target price. \u201cIf President Trump were to not be re-elected, we think Twitter shares could see pressure as the centrality of the platform could diminish somewhat. Outside of this risk, 2020 should be a steady year.\u201d", "description": "Twitter Inc.\u2019s efforts to reduce harmful activity on its platform while also making it easier for users to discover new content will be in focus once again...", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GX451_twitte_ZG_20181031200356.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
