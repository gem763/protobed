There was a lack of urgency and too many missed tackles. On the back foot, and we did not play like we need to play,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the second half we were playing on the front foot, physicality, driving mauls \u2026 and not missing tackles.\u201d\n\nHe also took a swipe at some of the late decisions by referee Angus Gardner, saying a penalty should have been awarded against No. 8 Louis Picamoles because he was offside intercepting an Argentina pass; that France players were warned by Gardner they risked a yellow card and didn\u2019t get them, and that a France player failed to roll away from a tackle and stopped scrumhalf Tomas Cubelli getting to the ball.\n\n\u201cThey were clear game-changing decisions,\u201d Ledesma said.\n\nFrance does not do cruise control anymore, even after fine tries from center Ga\u00ebl Fickou and bustling scrumhalf Antoine Dupont put Les Bleus in complete control in a first half which saw assured flyhalf Romain Ntamack convert both tries and add two penalties.\n\nHe then went from 4/4 to 4/5, missing a late penalty which would have given the French a five-point buffer. He had some nervous moments before Boffelli also missed his shot at goal.\n\nArgentina took the early lead through flyhalf Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez\u2019s 14th-minute penalty, but was outplayed for the remainder of the first half.\n\nThe second half was a contrast.\n\nNo. 8 Ortega Desio rose imperiously to cleanly take a lineout near the line and lock Guido Petti burrowed over for a converted score to start the comeback.\n\nFrance was getting smashed in the pack, and replacement Pumas hooker Julian Montoya pulled another try back in the 53rd following a driving maul. S\u00e1nchez missed the conversion, his kicking was clearly off.\n\nSo Urdapilleta took over, and his penalties suddenly had Argentina 21-20 ahead with 12 minutes left.\n\nLos Pumas fans were doing all the singing among the 44,000 fans at Tokyo Stadium, drowning out nervous French fans dreading recent history repeating itself.\n\nIn the end, the French fans had their voices back.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "France withstood a ferocious second-half comeback from Argentina to win 23-21 in a tension-filled Rugby World Cup group opener on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
