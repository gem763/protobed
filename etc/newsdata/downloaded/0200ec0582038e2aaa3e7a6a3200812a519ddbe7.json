The campaign projects that it will need $2.5 million to cover the month\u2019s expenses, and the additional $500,000 will allow it to make investments in November and December for get-out-the-vote programs and advertising.\n\n\u201cThe good news: while ambitious, we know $3 million in a month is an attainable goal \u2014 because we just raised over $3.1 million in September,\u201d Demissie said. \u201cMost importantly, at this point, it is the real amount we think we need to sustain, grow, and remain competitive in this primary contest.\u201d\n\nOn a conference call with reporters later Tuesday, Demissie did not share the campaign's cash on hand total or the size of its average donation last quarter. But he noted more than half of Booker's donors in the last 10 days were new to the campaign.\n\nThe campaign will continue to be transparent with periodic updates on its fundraising progress, Demissie said. But Booker won\u2019t threaten to end his campaign if it comes up short of its goal this month.\n\n\u201cIt was never about survival. It was about growth,\u201d Demissie said of the $1.7 million fundraising push. \u201cHad we not had this fundraising surge at the end of the quarter, we would\u2019ve had enough money to survive but not to grow, and growth is what we needed to win. Now we have the funds we need to grow. We need more.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e5/5e/826f899a4b3bbc651e81dd10b8bd/191001-cory-booker-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
