A U.S. F-22 Stealth Raptor 'Flew Under' Iran's F-4 Fighter", "language": "en", "text": "Key point: Iran's air force is far behind America's.\n\nBack in 2013, Pentagon press secretary George Little said that an Iranian air force F-4 Phantom combat plane attempted to intercept a U.S. MQ-1 Predator drone flying through international airspace near Iran.\n\nAs we reported back then, one of the two F-4 Phantom jets \u2014 in service in Iran since the Shah \u2014 came to about 16 miles from the Predator, but broke off pursuit after two American planes escorting the drone broadcast a warning message.\n\nIt was a close call.\n\nThe March 2013 episode happened only a few months after a two Sukhoi Su-25 attack planes operated by the Pasdaran (the informal name of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards) attempted to shoot down an American MQ-1 flying a routine surveillance flight in international airspace some 16 miles off Iran.\n\nAfter this attempted interception, the Pentagon decided to escort drones involved in reconnaissance missions with fighter jets: either F-18 Hornets embarked on the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis, currently in the U.S. Fifth Fleet area of responsibility, or F-22 Raptors like those deployed to Al Dhafra in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nNew details about the latest episode were recently disclosed by Air Force chief of staff Gen. Mark Welsh at an annual conference of the Air Force Association. On Sept. 17, the general not only confirmed that the escorting fighters were F-22 stealth fighters but also said that: \u201cHe [the Raptor pilot] flew under their aircraft [the F-4s] to check out their weapons load without them knowing that he was there, and then pulled up on their left wing and then called them and said \u2018you really ought to go home.\u2019\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Never had a chance.", "authors": ["Robert Beckhusen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9_wQwKLo4bxzKVaUkAzUMQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/8ff89e16d3669fb6d7ba55cb8316a020", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
