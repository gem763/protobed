But she \u201cdescribed one, unambiguously\u201d in a meeting with two representatives from NBC and her lawyer, Farrow reports.\n\n\u201cShe described the incident in detail, making it clear that she\u2019d been too drunk to consent and that she\u2019d said no to Lauer\u2019s request for anal sex repeatedly,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cHer attorney, Ari Wilkenfeld, paused the proceedings at one point to reiterate that the interaction was not consensual.\u201d\n\nWhat NBC News officials knew about the relationship, and when, has become a central question swirling around Farrow\u2019s explosive investigation, which has exposed a culture of abuse at the highest levels of the media and entertainment industries. Nevils\u2019 rape allegation became public when early excerpts of Farrow\u2019s book began dribbling out this week.\n\nREAD: Matt Lauer allegedly raped an NBC colleague at the Sochi Olympics\n\nLauer denied the claim in a letter published by Variety on Wednesday that describes the relationship as an affair. \u201cIt is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense,\u201d Lauer wrote. He added that he \u201cwas never told that Brooke claimed our encounter in Sochi was non-consensual.\u201d\n\nTop NBC brass have vehemently denied that they knew of Lauer\u2019s behavior before Nevils\u2019 2017 complaint, defending their characterizations of the network star\u2019s relationship with a junior staffer.\n\n\u201cToday, some have questioned why we used the term \u2018sexual misconduct\u2019 to describe the reason for Lauer\u2019s firing in the days following,\u201d Andy Lack, chairman of NBC News, wrote in a memo to staff on Wednesday. \u201cWe chose those words carefully to precisely mirror the public words at that time of the attorney representing our former NBC colleague.\u201d\n\nWilkenfeld, Nevils\u2019 attorney, said after Lauer\u2019s firing that she had detailed \u201cegregious acts of sexual harassment and misconduct.\u201d\n\nNevils told Farrow that she discussed Lauer with numerous associates inside and outside of NBC before she filed a formal complaint. His book recounts the November 2017 meeting where she shared her story with two women from NBCUniversal, one of whom Farrow identifies as top lawyer Stephanie Franco.\n\nAfter Nevils and her attorney described non-consensual sex, Farrow writes, \u201c[o]ne of the representatives from NBC replied that they understood, though later the network would say that it had reached no official conclusion on the matter.\u201d\n\nNBC representatives did not respond to VICE News\u2019 question of whether the potentially criminal nature of Nevils\u2019 allegation was relayed to Lack and NBC News President Noah Oppenheim.\n\nWilkenfeld didn\u2019t immediately return VICE News\u2019 messages on Friday. While Nevils called Lauer\u2019s letter \u201ca case study in victim-blaming\u201d in a statement to NBC News Thursday, she\u2019s barred from speaking about the company\u2019s handling of her case by a highly restrictive nondisclosure agreement she signed as part of her exit earlier this year.\n\nNevils told Farrow that she bled for days following her late-night encounter with Lauer. But her psychological trauma continued long after Lauer\u2019s firing.\n\nWhen she learned that NBC was publicly highlighting that her allegation was not criminal in nature, Farrow writes, \u201cshe left her desk, walked to the nearest bathroom, and threw up.\u201d\n\nCover: Matt Lauer faces new allegations of sexual misconduct as detailed accusations surface from NBC colleagues. - File Photo by: zz/Dennis Van Tine/STAR MAX/IPx 2013 5/31/13 Matt Lauer on the set of The Today Show.
