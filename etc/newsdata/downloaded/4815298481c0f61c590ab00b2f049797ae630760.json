We took some of those submissions and shared them with Ubisoft Presentation Art Director Alex Karpazis to get his expert take on the style and the strategy behind these character choices.\n\nKarpazis has plenty to say about the purely superficial bits of Rainbow Six style, calling out some rocking \"Twitch Prime purple hair\" in particular. But he also gets into how that style can affect gameplay, as with different gun sights that \"obscure different parts of the screen\" when trying to make your shot. There's also some general strategy advice mixed in, especially for people who accidentally kill their hostages with Fuze's grenade-spreading gadget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also convinced Karpazis to show off his own in-game loadouts and stats, a process he preceded by saying \"Nobody is good at Rainbow, including me... Please be gentle, I get it.\"\n\nThat bit of self-deprecation helps explain why he never wears special skins given only to developers: \"If I team-kill someone with that, it's over for me,\" he quipped.", "description": "Style and strategy thoughts on the tacti-coolest tops and best breaching britches.", "authors": ["Kyle Orland"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gamejudgesyourainbow7-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
