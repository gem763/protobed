Every year since 2007, Prof. Kim has released a new version of his book series \u201cTrend Korea,\u201d each of which have become best-sellers in the country. [YONHAP]\n\nSince 2007, consumer science Professor Kim Rando of Seoul National University has been predicting the top 10 trends of the upcoming year through his bestselling \u201cTrend Korea\u201d series.Last Thursday, Prof. Kim unveiled \u201cTrend Korea 2020,\u201d and stressed that 2020 is going to be the year when people\u2019s \u201cmultiple personas\u201d rise to the surface.\u201cI thought about what was the driving force behind the different keywords this year, and they seemed to point to multiple personas,\u201d explained Prof. Kim.\u201cLike psychiatrist Carl Jung said, the persona is a mask that people put on. People are really different inside and outside of the office. When you asked someone their identity in the past, they might have said that they are a member of a certain household or company, but those don\u2019t apply to today\u2019s nomadic society. Rather, people identify themselves more with their hobbies or communities.\u201dThe rise of social media fuels this phenomenon, Prof. Kim elaborated.\u201cPeople nowadays use several social media channels for different purposes - Twitter for voicing political opinions, Instagram for uploading pictures of food, etc. They sometimes have multiple accounts on a single platform, expressing different personalities in each. The selfies they post online look so different from their actual self that they will take the photos to plastic surgeons so that they can look like their online persona.\u201dMultiple personas, also described by Prof. Kim as \u201cMe and Myselves,\u201d is the first of 2020\u2019s top 10 keywords as well as the first letter of \u201cMighty Mice,\u201d the acronym that encapsulates all of the keywords of 2020. Next year is also the year of the rat in the Chinese Zodiac.Like \u201cMe and Myselves,\u201d many of next year\u2019s keywords reflect the behavior and attitudes of millennials, the cohort born between 1980 and 2000 that make up much of the incoming workforce.Another phrase on the list is \u201cGoodness and Fairness.\u201d The idea suggests that millennials are relentlessly insistent on fair play, having grown up in an environment of fierce competition and online transparency. \u201cElevate Yourself,\u201d the last keyword, is a continuation of the idea of the multiple personas - because young Koreans today don\u2019t associate their identity to their work, they spend more time on becoming a better version of themselves, as opposed to focusing on getting promoted earlier than a co-worker, a common ambition in previous generations.\u201cYou\u2019re with Us, \u2018Fansumer,\u2019\u201d a reference to fast-evolving K-pop fan culture, in which fans make huge investments to promote their favorite stars, is also on this year\u2019s top 10. The trend of \u201cIridescent OPAL,\u201d or older people with active lives, was going to extend as well, Kim predicts.Along with \u201cTrend Korea 2020,\u201d Kim also released the top 10 consumer goods and services that best reflected the trends of 2019. These included eco-friendly products as well as Instagrammable novelty foods, reflecting how consumers were applying different standards when making purchases.\u201cTrend Korea 2020\u201d is written by Seoul National University\u2019s Consumer Trend Center, which Prof. Kim heads. The series has been responsible for introducing terms like \u201cNew-tro\u201d and \u201cwork-life balance\u201d into the mainstream discourse.BY KIM EUN-JIN [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/29182423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
