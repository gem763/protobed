Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), and tying with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Zogby Analytics results released Monday reveal.\n\nThe poll, taken October 1-3, among 887 likely U.S. voters, shows the president edging out all of his potential Democrat challengers, minus Warren, who tied with Trump with 45 percent support. Notably, ten percent said they were \u201cnot sure\u201d who they would vote for between the two.\n\nWhile many Democrats view Biden as the most electable candidate, the survey\u2019s results show Trump defeating Biden 47 percent to 45 percent thanks, in part, to the president closing the gap in support among independent, suburban, and Hispanics voters.\n\nAccording to Zogby Analytics:\n\nThe reason President Trump is winning, barely, in a hypothetical match-up with the former vice president, Joe Biden, is that, in addition to winning with his normal base of men (Trump leads 54% to 39%), white voters (Trump leads 53% to 40%), union voters (Trump leads 62% to 32%), and southern voters (Trump leads 50% to 43%), Trump has also tightened the race with Independents (Biden leads 42% to 36%), suburban voters (Biden leads 49% to 43%), and Hispanics (Biden leads 47% to 43%). Trump is also beating Biden convincingly with two demographics he has recently made inroads with: large city voters (Trump leads 50% to 44%) and Generation X voters age 30-49 (Trump leads 49% to 41%).\n\nTrump also beats Sanders by a two-point margin, 46 percent to 44 percent, although Sanders continues to hold an edge with younger voters (18-29) with 56 percent support to Trump\u2019s 37 percent.\n\nThe president appears to perform the best against Buttigieg, who has failed to break through the top tier of candidates in the crowded Democrat field. Trump beats him by 11 points \u2013 49 percent to 38 percent \u2013 and defeats Harris 47 percent to 41 percent. The margin of error is +/- 3.3 percent.\n\n2020 National GE:\n\nTrump 49% (+11)\n\nButtigieg 38%\n\n.\n\nTrump 47% (+6)\n\nHarris 41%\n\n.\n\nTrump 47% (+2)\n\nBiden 45%\n\n.\n\nTrump 46% (+2)\n\nSanders 44%\n\n.\n\nTrump 45%\n\nWarren 45% Zogby Analytics 10/1-3https://t.co/WhmcT0RyDw \u2014 Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) October 23, 2019\n\nThe poll emphasizes that 2020 results will largely hinge on voter turnout\u2013 a point emphasized in Moody\u2019s Analytics 2020 election forecast.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:", "description": "President Trump edges out top Democrat candidates in hypothetical general election matchups, Zogby Analytics results released Monday reveal.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181743344-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
