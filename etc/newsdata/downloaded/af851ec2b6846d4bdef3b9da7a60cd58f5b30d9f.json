Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) said he couldn\u2019t rule out voting to impeach Trump and said he\u2019s had Watergate on his mind.\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry on Friday did not adhere to a deadline to produce subpoenaed documents relevant to an impeachment inquiry that has increasingly shown Trump orchestrating an effort to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on a potential 2020 political rival.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlso, a deposition planned for Friday of a senior career official at the Defense Department has been postponed until next week. House investigators expect Laura Cooper to provide details about the nearly $400 million in military aid that was withheld from Ukraine as Trump pressed the country\u2019s president to investigate Biden and his son.\n\nCooper is one of at least five officials who have been summoned to testify next week.\n\n\u25cf Impeachment inquiry shows Trump at the center of Ukraine efforts against rivals.\n\n\u25cf After saying Trump held back aid to pressure Ukraine, Mulvaney tries to back away from his comments.\n\n\u25cf Mulvaney\u2019s twin admissions put Trump at the center of emoluments and Ukraine controversies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n7:30 p.m.: In his opening testimony, George Kent expressed dismay on treatment of ousted ambassador Marie Yovanovitch\n\nGeorge Kent, a career State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy, told congressional investigators this week he was perturbed by a claim from former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who said she was abruptly removed from her position in May based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,\u201d even though she had done nothing wrong.\n\nAD\n\nThe Washington Post first reported that Kent testified Tuesday that he had raised concerns in early 2015 about Hunter Biden serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. In his opening statement, which was obtained Friday by The Washington Post, Kent testified that he and other U.S. officials who \u201chave spoken publicly in Ukraine to push back against Russian aggression and corrupt influences have been subjected to defamatory disinformation campaigns.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nYovanovitch testified last week that the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, had for months accused her of privately badmouthing the president and seeking to protect the interests of the Bidens, claims she denied. Yovanovitch said the State Department\u2019s No. 2 official told her earlier this year that the president had lost confidence in her, and that the agency had been under significant pressure to remove her since the summer of 2018.\n\n\u201cI fully share the concerns in Ambassador Yovanovich\u2019s statement on Friday expressing her incredulity that the U.S. Government chose to remove an Ambassador based, as best as she could tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives at an especially challenging time in bilateral relations with a newly elected Ukranian President,\u201d Kent testified.\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement Friday, Kent\u2019s attorneys said he was a fact witness and \u201cnot there to testify on behalf of any side.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWith varying degrees of accuracy, several news organizations and sources have characterized the testimony he provided in closed session,\u201d his attorneys said. \u201cWe would caution that cherry-picked elements of his testimony might not give the full picture.\u201d\n\n6 p.m.: Perry won\u2019t comply with supboena in impeachment probe, Department of Energy says\n\nPerry will not comply with a subpoena demanding documents pertaining to the impeachment inquiry, the Energy Department said Friday.\n\nIn a letter to House Democrats, DOE Assistant Secretary Melissa Burnison argued the impeachment inquiry was illegitimate, adding the House had not adopted a resolution authorizing an investigation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEven if the inquiry was validly authorized, much of the information sought in the subpoena appears to consist of confidential Executive Branch communications that are potentially protected by privilege and would require careful review to ensure that no such information is improperly disclosed,\u201d Burnison wrote.\n\nAD\n\nBurnison also reiterated Trump\u2019s position that the inquiry \u201clacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness or even the most elementary due process protections.\u201d\n\nPerry, who plans to leave the administration by the end of the year, initially said he wasn\u2019t sure whether he would comply with the House subpoena and deferred to his counsel. The subpoena specifically seeks information related to his involvement in the July call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAD\n\nPerry has previously said his departure from the administration has \u201cabsolutely nothing,\u201d to do with the Ukraine controversy.\n\n3 p.m.: John Kasich says he now backs Trump impeachment\n\nFormer Ohio governor John Kasich, who has been a critic of Trump\u2019s since he ran against him in the 2016 presidential primary, said Friday that he thinks Trump\u2019s behavior rises \u201cto the level of impeachment.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLook, I fought with people on the air about, \u2018is there a quid pro quo?\u2019 and \u2018does this rise to the level of impeachment?\u2019 Kasich said in a CNN interview. \u201cI now believe that it does. And I say it with great sadness. This is not something I really wanted to do. I voted to impeach Bill Clinton and that was really hard, and this has been excruciatingly hard. But this behavior in my opinion cannot be tolerated and action is going to have to be taken.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKasich also said withholding aid to a country over policy differences is one thing, but doing it \u201cso a political operation can take place, to me it\u2019s totally inappropriate. It\u2019s an abuse of power.\u201d\n\nKasich confirmed his stance in a tweet shortly thereafter, writing that Mulvaney\u2019s comments led him to believe Trump \u201cshould be impeached by the US House and face a trial in the US Senate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n2:30 p.m.: Bernie Sanders says G-7 in Doral \u2018alone is worthy of impeachment\u2019\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) blasted Trump\u2019s decision to hold the G-7 global conference at his private resort in Miami, calling the president \u201cthe most corrupt president in our history.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a president who is using the Oval Office to enrich himself. That alone is worthy of impeachment, never mind his other corrupt transgressions,\u201d Sanders tweeted.\n\nDemocrats, and some Republicans, have condemned Trump\u2019s location choice, but some House Democrats have also urged that they stay focused on Ukraine for impeachment purposes.\n\n2 p.m.: Republican lawmaker won\u2019t rule out impeaching Trump, compares him to Nixon\n\nGOP Rep. Francis Rooney (Fla.) offered a damning assessment of Mulvaney, defended career diplomats, and said he\u2019s not afraid of the president\u2019s wrath.\n\nAD\n\nRooney said Friday he\u2019s had Watergate on his mind lately, specifically that critics called it a witch hunt before it was clear how bad it really was. He won\u2019t rule out impeaching Trump, he said, before knowing all the facts.\n\nRooney said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe\u201d Mulvaney\u2019s admission of a quid pro quo and his later reversal.\n\n\u201cI was shocked that he said that stuff. When the president has said many times there wasn\u2019t a quid pro quo. . . . . and now Mick Mulvaney goes up and says, \u2018Yeah, it was all part of the whole plan!\u2019 \u201d Rooney said. As for Mulvaney walking back his comments, the congressman said, \u201cYou know, this is a funny business. How in life can you do those kinds of things when you\u2019ve just said it right there on national TV.\u201d\n\nRooney also said that the State Department officials testifying in the impeachment proceedings \u201care not partisan people\u201d and that he\u2019s eager to hear from former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nAs for the political consequences of possibly voting for Trump\u2019s impeachment, Rooney said, \u201cI didn\u2019t take this job to keep it. . . . I took this job to do the right thing at all times.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s wrath?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do to me? I mean, he can say bad things, but it\u2019s just what it is,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people around who are seriously concerned about being criticized by the president. Seriously. I just want to call them as I see it. I want to get the facts and do the right thing because I\u2019ll be looking at my children a lot longer than I\u2019m looking to anybody in this building.\u201d\n\n1 p.m.: GOP Rep. Collins tells three panels running investigation he wants to see their work\n\nHouse members who are not on either the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs or Oversight committees are not invited to participate in the depositions of witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nRepublicans not on those committees have complained about being shut out of the process, even though GOP members who are present for the hearings say they\u2019ve had equal time behind closed doors to question witnesses.\n\nRep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), ranking Republican of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to each of the three Democratic chairmen running the probe that it is his right to review \u201call records, documents, transcripts, and other materials obtained in the course of the ongoing joint investigation.\u201d He cited a clause in the House Rules that says each member of the House \u201cshall have access\u201d to committee records.\n\nSo far, efforts complaints by Republicans about how Democrats are running the investigation have been disregarded by the majority.\n\n12:50 p.m.: Trump highlights reports regarding Biden\u2019s son\n\nTrump highlighted reports Friday that a career State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy told congressional investigators this week that he had raised concerns in early 2015 about Biden\u2019s son serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but was turned away by a Biden staffer.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he \u201cnever had the privilege\u201d of meeting the official, George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported that Kent testified Tuesday that he worried that Hunter Biden\u2019s position at the firm Burisma Holdings would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest.\n\n\u201cHe excoriated the Obama administration and Joe Biden and Joe Biden\u2019s son, saying that he has tremendous problems, tremendous problems with Joe Biden\u2019s son and the Ukraine,\u201d Trump old reporters.\n\nTrump also took aim at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), calling him \u201cCrooked Schiff,\u201d and declined an opportunity to clarify comments made Thursday by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nMulvaney told reporters that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid in part to pressure Ukraine to pursue an investigation into a debunked conspiracy theory that a hacked Democratic National Committee computer server was taken to Ukraine in 2016.\n\nMulvaney subsequently said in a statement that \u201cthere was absolutely no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he clarified it,\u201d Trump said Friday.\n\n11:55 a.m.: Trump vents about \u2018Do Nothing Democrats\u2019\n\nTrump returned to Twitter late Friday morning, offering a familiar take on the impeachment inquiry, including an attack on House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cCan you believe I am doing this important work for our Country, and have to deal with Corrupt Adam Schiff and the Do Nothing Democrats at the same time?\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cIt was not intended to be this way for a President!\u201d\n\n11:45 a.m.: McCarthy defends Mulvaney, attacks Schiff\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Friday defended acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney after the White House scrambled to walk back his comments during a combative press briefing on Thursday about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think Mick was very clear in cleaning up his statement there was no quid pro quo,\u201d McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s briefing, Mulvaney said Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid in part to pressure Ukraine to pursue an investigation into a debunked conspiracy theory that a hacked Democratic National Committee computer server was taken to Ukraine in 2016.\n\nLater, after Trump\u2019s lawyer and other Republicans distanced themselves from Mulvaney, the White House walked back his comments, issuing an official statement accusing the media of misconstruing his words.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d Mulvaney\u2019s written statement said, \u201cthere was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think what Mick clarified in his statement was very clear,\u201d McCarthy told reporters\n\nMcCarthy also tore into House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), pledging to renew efforts on Monday to pass a resolution censuring him for the way he has handled the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cHe should be held accountable, just like every other member,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nHe said House members can no longer trust Schiff, in part because he embellished the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine during a hearing last month.\n\nSchiff later said his remarks were intended as parody and that Trump and others who have criticized him should have recognized that.\n\n11:30 a.m.: At least five witnesses summoned for depositions next week\n\nHouse investigators plan to resume closed-door depositions next week, beginning Tuesday with acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor.\n\nTaylor, on text messages with two other U.S. diplomats, raised alarms about the White House holding back military aid to Ukraine, calling it \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, lawmakers are expected to hear from Ambassador Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs, and Michael Duffey, associate director of national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget. Duffey\u2019s signature was on the letters reapportioning the Ukraine aid.\n\nOn Thursday, Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense whose portfolio includes Russia and Ukraine, and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, are expected to testify.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian\n\n11 a.m.: Republicans seize on Post story about Hunter Biden\n\nRepublicans seized Friday on a Washington Post report that a career State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy told congressional investigators this week that he had raised concerns in early 2015 about Biden\u2019s son serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but was turned away by a Biden staffer.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 witch hunt against President Trump has backfired on Adam B. Schiff and hit Joe Biden,\u201d Steve Guest, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee, said in an email blasted to reporters.\n\nSchiff is the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee and is playing a leading role in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cOutrageous,\u201d Guest continued. \u201cHunter Biden had no experience in Ukraine or with natural gas, yet he was the son of the Vice President, thus making him the perfect candidate for the board of Burisma.\u201d\n\n10:50 a.m.: Trump\u2019s decision to hold G-7 at his property rankles leaders\n\nThough it\u2019s not part of the formal impeachment inquiry, Trump\u2019s decision to hold a meeting of global leaders at one of his private resorts is casting another shadow over the administration, and rankling global leaders and Republicans.\n\nThe Post\u2019s Brussels bureau chief Michael Birnbaum asked European Council President Donald Tusk whether it would be appropriate to spend public funds on a Trump business. Tusk said, \u201cNot at all.\u201d\n\nBirnbaum also asked German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a news conference whether she was ready to spend German tax money at Trump\u2019s Doral resort in Miami.\n\n\u201cThis is a decision taken by the American president. I haven\u2019t had time to deal with this yet,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cWe will take a close look at his invitation, and my intention is to attend the summit.\u201d\n\nBack in Washington, Republicans who have defended Trump against the House\u2019s impeachment probe, are starting to break with the president over his Doral choice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why at this moment they had to do that,\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said on CNN, calling it \u201cunnecessary\u201d and adding, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), when asked whether it was appropriate, said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n10:45 a.m.: Hillary Clinton suggests Putin has kompromat on Trump, Russians will back Tulsi Gabbard in third-party bid\n\nAt Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) hit back at critics who charged she\u2019s too close to Russia. \u201cThis morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I\u2019m an asset of Russia,\u201d she said. \u201cCompletely despicable.\u201d\n\nGabbard won\u2019t be happy to hear Hillary Clinton\u2019s latest interview. Nor will President Trump or another of Clinton\u2019s 2016 opponents, whom Clinton has now lodged similar accusations about.\n\nIn a conversation on former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe\u2019s podcast, Clinton raised the possibility that the Russians are leveraging a number of top U.S. politicians. She suggested Russia had kompromat on Trump. She accused 2016 Green Party nominee Jill Stein of being a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d And she suggested Russia might back Gabbard as a third-party candidate.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Aaron Blake\n\n10:20 a.m.: McCarthy signals intentions to attack Schiff at news conference\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) signaled that he plans to use his weekly news conference to attack House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) for his handling of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cRep. Adam Schiff isn\u2019t a special prosecutor,\u201d McCarthy tweeted. \u201cHe is a member of Congress, and his actions are a blatant abuse of power. I\u2019ll be speaking about this and more at my weekly Q&A with reporters.\u201d\n\n9:15 a.m.: Perry defends Trump, won\u2019t say if he\u2019ll comply with subpoena\n\nPerry declined to say whether he would comply with a House subpoena demanding documents relevant to the impeachment inquiry on Friday as he defended Trump\u2019s actions with Ukraine.\n\nAppearing on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Perry said he is still awaiting advice from his department\u2019s general counsel about whether to comply with the subpoena, which seeks information related to Perry\u2019s involvement in the July call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen what the general counsel\u2019s advice to me will be,\u201d Perry said.\n\nPerry said he told Trump \u201cmultiple times\u201d that he should call Zelensky because he was convinced Zelensky was serious about fighting corruption in his country and moving from Russian gas to American gas.\n\nPerry said that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d involving military aid and investigating the Bidens and that Trump never mentioned the Bidens to him.\n\n\u201cDid corruption come up? We heard corruption in almost every conversation we had, talking about Ukraine and talking about whether President Zelensky was going to come over here, because President Trump wasn\u2019t going to send American money to a country that had a history of being corrupt, and he was hammering that,\u201d Perry said.\n\nPerry also defended Trump\u2019s use of his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to intervene in U.S.-Ukrainian affairs, saying that as governor of Texas he had routinely relied on people outside of government for help.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see a problem with that at all,\u201d Perry said.\n\nPerry said he doesn\u2019t believe Trump has done anything wrong more broadly.\n\n\u201cWhat he did wrong in a lot of people\u2019s eyes is that he won an election,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe have a lot of great things we could be doing, but we\u2019re hamstrung by this obvious politically generated issue.\u201d\n\nPerry, who plans to leave the administration at the end of the year, said his departure has \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d to do with the Ukraine controversy and that his relationship with Trump remains \u201cawesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe never ceases to amaze me,\u201d Perry said.\n\n8:45 a.m.: Rep. Speier, member of Intelligence panel: \u2018I\u2019m ready to vote\u2019 on impeachment\n\nRep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) said that from information already gleaned by the House Intelligence Committee overseeing the impeachment inquiry, she could vote now to impeach Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to vote on it. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question in my mind or anyone\u2019s mind, but we\u2019ll continue to do our due diligence,\u201d she said on CNN.\n\nSpeier also offered insight into the testimony of Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who met with House investigators Thursday.\n\n\u201cWell I think what we learned from the ambassador, he was like the enabler,\u201d Speier said. \u201cIt was like the drunk who tells you that you should go out and buy him another bottle of bourbon, and you do it.\u201d\n\n8:40 a.m.: Grisham defends holding G-7 at Trump property, says oxygen would have been an issue at another possible location\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham on Friday defended Trump\u2019s decision to hold the 2020 Group of Seven summit of world leaders at Trump National Doral Miami golf resort in Florida, another issue that Democrats have cited as evidence of corruption.\n\nDuring an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Grisham ticked off several factors that she said made Doral a more attractive location than other sites that the White House considered, including its access to a major airport.\n\nAnd then Grisham added this: \u201cI won\u2019t name what site it was or what state it was in, but the altitude could have made people sick, and oxygen tanks would have been brought in, so there\u2019s a lot that goes into these things.\u201d\n\n8:35 a.m.: Grisham says Democrats are throwing \u2018temper tantrum after temper tantrum\u2019\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Friday that the American people are tired of what she characterized as \u201ctemper tantrum after temper tantrum\u201d from House Democrats spearheading the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe people of this country know what the Dems are doing,\u201d she said during an appearance on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re tired of it.\u201d\n\nGrisham said Trump would continue to focus on issues including immigration, health care and job creation.\n\n8:15 a.m.: Jeffries tells McConnell to \u2018PIPE DOWN\u2019\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), the House Democratic caucus chairman, delivered a pointed response Friday to tweets earlier this week from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that contended House Democrats were violating norms in the impeachment inquiry and too obsessed with impeachment to get other work done.\n\n\u201cThis guy stole a Supreme Court seat from @BarackObama and the American people,\u201d Jeffries tweeted, referring to McConnell\u2019s refusal to hold a hearing or vote on the nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever lecture the House on norms or precedent,\u201d Jeffries continued. \u201cYou have ZERO credibility. Do something about prescription drug prices and the gun violence epidemic or PIPE DOWN.\u201d\n\nJeffries, an ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), was referring to two issues on which the House has passed legislation but the Senate has not acted.\n\nIf Trump is impeached by the Democratic-led House, he will face a trial in the Republican-led Senate.\n\n8 a.m.: White House, Perry face deadlines for subpoenas\n\nBoth the White House and Perry face Friday deadlines for documents related to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe White House has indicated it will not comply. It\u2019s less clear how Perry, who plans to leave the administration by the end of the year, will respond.\n\n\u201cThe House has sent a subpoena over for the records that we have, and our general counsel and the White House counsel are going through the process right now,\u201d Perry said during a Wednesday morning appearance on Fox Business Network. \u201cI\u2019m going to follow the lead of my counsel on that.\u201d\n\nTrump has said that Perry asked him to make the July call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. Perry later told reporters that he did it so Trump and Zelensky could talk about energy issues.\n\nThe House subpoena directs Perry to hand over documents related to his involvement in the call as well as to a Ukrainian state-owned natural gas company.\n\nTrump confirmed Perry\u2019s departure plans to reporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe already have his replacement,\u201d Trump said on his way to a campaign stop in Texas. \u201cRick has done a fantastic job. But it was time.\u201d\n\n7:45 a.m.: Diplomat tells investigators he raised alarms in 2015 about Hunter Biden\u2019s Ukraine work but was rebuffed\n\nA career State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy told congressional investigators this week that he had raised concerns in early 2015 about Biden\u2019s son serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but was turned away by a Biden staffer, according to three people familiar with the testimony.\n\nGeorge Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Tuesday that he worried that Hunter Biden\u2019s position at the firm Burisma Holdings would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality rules surrounding the deposition.\n\nKent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for obtaining influence with his father, the people said. But when Kent raised the issue with Biden\u2019s office, he was told the then-vice president did not have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau Biden, was battling cancer, they said.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 John Hudson, Rachael Bade and Matt Viser\n\n7:30 a.m.: Deposition of Defense Department official pushed back\n\nA deposition planned for Friday morning of Cooper, a senior career official at the Department of Defense overseeing the military aid program for Ukraine, has been pushed back until next week.\n\nHouse investigators expect Cooper to provide details about the nearly $400 million in military aid that was withheld from Ukraine as Trump pressed the country\u2019s president to investigate the Bidens and a debunked conspiracy theory that a hacked Democratic National Committee computer server was taken to Ukraine in 2016 to hide evidence that it was that country, not Russia, that interfered in the presidential election.\n\nCooper\u2019s closed-door deposition has been rescheduled for Thursday.\n\n7 a.m.: GOP effort to censure Schiff delayed until next week\n\nHouse Republicans have postponed their efforts until next week to seek the censure of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) for his handling of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe decision came Thursday after news of the death of House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who was admired on both sides of the aisle.\n\nHouse Democrats are expected to move to block the resolution shortly after it is refiled next week.\n\nThe resolution, introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), takes issue with Schiff\u2019s remarks at a Sept. 26 hearing. Schiff embellished the transcript of the July phone call in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.\n\nSchiff later said his remarks were intended as parody and that Trump and others who have criticized him should have recognized that.\n\nThe resolution also takes aim at Schiff for other actions, including some related to the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\n6 a.m.: Trump continues assault on Democrats at campaign rally in Dallas\n\nAt a campaign rally Thursday night in Dallas, Trump continued his weeks-long assault on congressional Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry into his conduct in office, which Democratic leaders say is an unconstitutional abuse of power.\n\nThe president repeatedly slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as \u201ccrazy,\u201d and he claimed a \u201cgreat betrayal\u201d by House Democrats and the media to \u201coverthrow\u201d the results of the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t believe anymore that they love our country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nTrump added, \u201cThey continue the outrageous impeachment witch hunt with nothing \u2014 with nothing. They come after me, but what they\u2019re really doing is they\u2019re coming after the Republican Party, and what they\u2019re really, really doing is they\u2019re coming after and fighting you.
