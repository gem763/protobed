with credits including the little-known, but somewhat acclaimed film The Other Land - before liquidating his assets and moving to Spain.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Hundreds of protesters filled Tahrir Square on Friday\n\nHis popularity skyrocketed following the release of a series of videos in which he claimed to have insider information about the Egyptian military's mishandling of state funds.\n\nHis father, Ali Abdul Khalek, was a national weightlifting champion before he launched his family contracting businesses for himself and his sons, including Mohamed.\n\nIn an interview with pro-government TV presenter Ahmed Moussa, Abdul Khalek appeared to disown his son and sought to discredit his allegations, saying his family owed their fortunes to the armed forces.\n\nWhat does he allege?\n\nMr Ali claims to be owed millions of Egyptian pounds in unpaid dues from the military and says he had fled the country over fears of \"retaliation\" from the authorities after he challenged the armed forces.\n\nHis familiarity with the armed forces' building projects through his work with them lent him credibility among Egyptian audiences, with many hailing him as a whistleblower.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Ali's videos have resonated with many Egyptians\n\nHe has also accused Mr Sisi of squandering state funds to build presidential palaces and villas, and claimed that projects were being undertaken as favours to generals in his close circle.\n\nHe has continued to escalate his tone against Mr Sisi, while at times pointing out that not all army officers are corrupt.\n\nIn his more recent videos, he demanded that Minister of Defence Mohamed Zaki arrest the president, and separately claimed he had received messages of support from army and police officers.\n\nSince the release of the videos, a lawyer has accused Mr Ali of \"high treason\" and he has faced criticism on traditional media outlets.\n\nWhy did Egyptians heed his call?\n\nMr Ali's allegations over the mishandling of funds appear to have struck a chord with many Egyptians who have grown increasingly disaffected by ongoing austerity measures.\n\nIn July, official state figures revealed that 32.5% of Egyptians were now living in poverty, up from 27.8% in 2015.\n\nYet, in spite of the economic pressures, the prospect of protests remained unlikely, due to widespread protest fatigue and harsh repercussions for any displays of opposition.\n\nBut to the surprise of many, small-scale protests broke out in and around Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square and other cities, breaking a barrier of fear that was built during Mr Sisi's years in power.\n\nMr Ali's combination of proclaimed insider knowledge and his populist rhetoric and vernacular set him apart from both the Islamist opposition and secular political activists, whose demands have often focused on rights rather than economic gains for citizens.\n\nMoreover, Mr Ali sought to reassure Egyptians that they would be safe if they protested amid celebrations for a football match on the same day, which may have contributed in part to encouraging the demonstrations.\n\nAs it happened, hundreds were reportedly arrested after protesters took to the streets.\n\nPrior to Mr Ali's appearance on the scene, anger had already been mounting in the country due to economic reforms which have strained the people. These included the flotation of the Egyptian pound in 2016 which caused it to shed over half its value and dramatically increased the prices of goods.\n\nMr Sisi has steadfastly defended the austerity measures as necessary, saying they would yield results later. In speeches, he has said \"we [Egyptians] are very poor\" and called on Egyptians to donate spare change to his Long Live Egypt fund.\n\nYet, despite denying Mr Ali's allegations of corruption, Mr Sisi has remained resolute in his response to the videos, acknowledging the construction of palaces and saying he would continue doing so \"for Egypt\".\n\nThis confirmation from Mr Sisi that millions have indeed been spent on palaces and other projects, coupled with Mr Ali's sharp response, was enough to push a small minority over the edge to take their anger to the streets.", "description": "Who is the man whose online anger brought Egyptians onto the streets?", "authors": ["Joana Saba", "Bbc Monitoring"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2621/production/_108916790_mediaitem108916789.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
