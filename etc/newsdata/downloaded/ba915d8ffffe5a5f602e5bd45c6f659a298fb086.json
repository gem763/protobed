In the ABC interview, Leutner recalled how, before the stabbing, Weier told her to lay down on the ground and cover herself with sticks and leaves to hide, as part of what Leutner believed to be a game of hide-and-seek.\n\n\u201cBut it was really just a trick to get me down there,\u201d Leutner said.\n\nWith Leutner on the ground, Geyser stabbed her 19 times before she and Weier left Leutner for dead. Leutner said she eventually got up, grabbed trees for support, and made her way to a nearby road where a bicyclist found her and called for help.\n\nThe case drew widespread attention because of how young the girls were, how vicious the attack was and because the two attackers said they did it because they believed Slender Man would otherwise hurt them and their families.\n\nGeyser and Weier were charged as adults and eventually pleaded guilty, with Geyser receiving a harsher sentence because she was the one who did the actual stabbing, according to prosecutors. Geyser was ordered to spend 40 years in a mental institution. Weier was committed to a mental health facility for 25 years.\n\nLeutner told ABC News that charging her attackers as adults was the right decision.\n\n\u201cIf they had stolen a candy bar, sure that\u2019s a child. But you tried to kill somebody. That\u2019s an adult crime,\u201d she said.\n\nLeutner said she doesn\u2019t want to see or talk to Geyser and Weier again, and that what Geyser did was \u201cprobably unforgivable.\u201d\n\nShe said she wasn\u2019t surprised when she heard about Geyser\u2019s motive \u201cbecause she believed so hard in this thing that she would do anything for it.\u201d Still, she said \u201cit was a little shocking to me to see that they had this big, huge plan that they had been working on for months.\u201d\n\nEven though she doesn\u2019t want to talk to her attackers again, Leutner surprised herself when asked what she would say to Geyser if she did speak to her.\n\n\u201cI would probably, initially thank her,\u201d Leutner said. \u201cI would say, \u2018Just because of what she did, I have the life I have now. I really, really like it and I have a plan. I didn\u2019t have a plan when I was 12, and now I do because of everything that I went through.\u2019\u201d\n\nLeutner, now 17, is a high school senior and plans to attend college in 2020. She wants to pursue a medical career, which she said is a goal inspired by what happened to her.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Payton Leutner, a Wisconsin girl who was lured into the woods by two friends and stabbed 19 times in an effort to please a fictional horror character called Slender Man said she's come to terms with aspects of the attack but still sleeps with broken scissors \"just in case.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/Girls_Stabbing_Plot_Survivor_Speaks_86022.jpg-830c2_c0-0-1928-1125_s1200x700.jpg?8a28e7e211b0516aef14600c691b5f02536759ce", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
