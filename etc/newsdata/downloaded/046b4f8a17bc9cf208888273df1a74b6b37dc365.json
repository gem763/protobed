I can\u2019t remember that far back.\u201d\n\nBut Uniqlo\u2019s Korean arm subtitled its version of the ad slightly differently, reading: \u201cI can\u2019t remember things that happened more than 80 years ago.\u201d\n\nThat would put the moment as 1939, towards the end of Japan\u2019s brutal colonial rule over the Korean peninsula, where the period is still bitterly resented, and some South Koreans reacted furiously.\n\n\u201cA nation that forgets history has no future. We can\u2019t forget what happened 80 years ago that Uniqlo made fun of,\u201d commented one internet user on Naver, the country\u2019s largest portal.\n\nThe phrase \u201cUniqlo, comfort women\u201d, in reference to women forced to become sex slaves to Japanese troops during the Second World War, was among the most searched terms on Naver at the weekend, and demonstrators protested outside Uniqlo shops on Monday.\n\nSeoul and Tokyo are currently locked in a bitter trade and diplomatic row stemming from historical disputes, and South Korean consumers have mounted boycotts of Japanese products.\n\nUniqlo \u2014 which has 186 stores in South Korea \u2014 has itself been one of the highest-profile targets, while Japanese carmakers\u2019 sales dropped nearly 60 percent year-on-year in September.\n\nThe company denied the allegations in a statement, saying the text was altered to highlight the age gap between the individuals and show that its fleeces were for people \u201cacross generations\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe ad had no intention whatsoever to imply anything\u201d about colonial rule, a Uniqlo representative told AFP on Monday, adding the firm had withdrawn the ad in an effort at damage control.\n\nAnalysts said the controversy demonstrated the politicisation of the neighbours\u2019 complex history.\n\nThe reaction was excessive, said Kim Sung-han, a former foreign affairs vice minister who teaches at Korea University, involving a \u201cjump in logic\u201d that \u201cassumes everything Uniqlo does is political as a Japanese company\u201d.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how her remark could be linked to the comfort women issue,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is overly sensitive.\u201d", "description": "Seoul (AFP) \u2013 Japanese retail giant Uniqlo has pulled a commercial featuring a 98-year-old US fashion figure from South Korean screens, it said", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/f011c1_japanese-retail-giant-uniqlo-has-pulled-an-ad-in-south-korea-it-was-accused-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
