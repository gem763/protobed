Amazon argued the workers\u2019 claims were \u201cgrossly inaccurate,\u201d according to Reuters.\n\nThe case dismissal comes after a 2014 ruling by the Supreme Court, which decided companies do not have to compensate employees for mandatory security checks \u2014 amending the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nAfter Kentucky federal court consolidated the plaintiff\u2019s case with similar ones, a judge used the 2014 Supreme Court ruling to strike down the case. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, Ohio overturned the ruling in 2018.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
