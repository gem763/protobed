In it, she sought Mnuchin\u2019s views on what triggered the spike in rates for repurchase agreements and expressed concern about potential costs to businesses and consumers if strains persist.\n\nShe also set herself up for another fight with Wall Street, citing an article reporting that large banks were using the repo-market chaos to pressure the Federal Reserve to weaken liquidity rules they despise. Warren said she\u2019s concerned the Financial Stability Oversight Council, whose chair is Mnuchin, might support those efforts.\n\n\u201cThese rules were designed to ensure that banks have enough cash on hand to meet their obligations in the event of another market crash,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBanks are reporting profits at record levels, and it would be painfully ironic if unexplained chaos in a small corner of the banking market became an excuse to further loosen rules that protect the economy from these types of risks.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury Department declined to comment.\n\nBanking industry complaints about regulations have gotten louder since the mid-September dislocation. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said Oct. 15 that the bank had the money and inclination to step in when rates surged, but liquidity rules prevented it from doing so.\n\nRegulations introduced after the 2008 crisis oblige financial institutions to hold more cash and cash-like assets as a buffer against times of stress, and systemically important banks -- JPMorgan (NYSE: ) is the largest in the U.S. -- face year-end reviews to determine how much more common equity they must carry.\n\nThe Fed has been injecting liquidity into the funding markets since Sept. 17, when the rate on overnight general collateral repo jumped to 10% from around 2%. The central bank has also begun buying Treasury bills to add reserves back into the system. These efforts have mostly calmed repo rates.\n\n\u201cWhile the Federal Reserve has taken the necessary action to ensure that markets continue to function, I am alarmed that it has been required to engage in money market interventions that have not been used since the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d wrote Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts.\n\nWarren came to prominence because of her criticisms of Wall Street and calls for tougher oversight of the financial industry after the 2008 financial crisis. Her advocacy was pivotal to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and helped lock in her election to the Senate.\n\nWarren asked that Mnuchin respond to these and other questions no later than Nov. 1:", "description": "Warren Steps Into Repo Market Turmoil, Asks Mnuchin for Answers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5aa8d39f14650e7ff369b9d207ab7a2d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
