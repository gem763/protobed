Taxpayers aren't interested in funding campus kooks", "language": "en", "text": "Times are bad for higher education, and higher educators are beginning to notice it. But the industry\u2019s problems are mostly of its own making.\n\nThe latest \"cri de coeur\" comes from University of North Dakota\u2019s Sheila Liming, who writes, \u201cMy University is Dying; And soon yours will be, too.\u201d\n\nShe notes: \u201cStarting in 2016, our state university system endured three successive rounds of annual budget cuts, with average 10-percent reductions resulting in a loss of more than a third of the system\u2019s overall funding. Additional cuts, even, were on the table this past year. And while our state legislators ultimately avoided taking yet one more stab at the dismembered body of higher education, there has been no discussion of restoring any of those funds.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just North Dakota: \u201cThe experience of living with the metastasizing effects of austerity grants me some insight into what has been going on in Alaska. In July, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced a plan to strip the University of Alaska system of 41 percent of its operating budget. He has since tempered this plan, opting instead for a 20-percent cut to be meted out over a period of three years.\u201d Why are these cuts actually occurring?\n\nThere are lots of cuts in lots of places, and while some of them can be blamed on state budgets, that\u2019s not really what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re in an economic boom \u2014 North Dakota is even a center of fracking \u2014 and states are still spending plenty. The ultimate reason for the cuts is that taxpayers in many states no longer think higher education is worth the money.\n\nFaculty members, and the administrators who are the real power in universities nowadays, dismiss this as ignorant anti-intellectualism. But is it?\n\nA campus divided: 'Tolerant' educators exile Trump voters from campus: Glenn Reynolds\n\nWhom the gods would destroy, they first make crazy. And higher education has become objectively crazy. It\u2019s not a shock that taxpayers think their money might be better spent elsewhere than on subsidizing enclaves of insanity. It\u2019s especially true when universities spend so much of their time attacking so many of the Americans who pay taxes to support them, from Trump voters, to Christians, to gun owners and businesspeople. It takes a lot of chutzpah to slap someone in the face and then put your hand out for money, but that\u2019s what universities have been doing for decades and with special force over the past few years.\n\nStudents march in Sacramento, California, in 2012. More\n\nOne example occurred recently at The University of Maine. Maine has chosen to rename Columbus Day \u201cIndigenous People\u2019s Day.\u201d This drew objection from the mayor of Waterville, Nick Isgro, and the University of Maine College Republicans put up a Facebook post in support, reminding people that some of the indigenous peoples Columbus and his successors conquered practiced cannibalism and ritual sacrifice.\n\nThis statement was, of course, true, but that didn\u2019t matter. It drew a harsh response from UMaine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy and Dean of Students and Vice President for Student Life Robert Dana, in the form of a mass email to all students, shaming the College Republicans for daring to take a pro-Columbus position. They stated: \"The positions reflected and reposted on that [Facebook] page are neither supported by nor reflective of the University of Maine's values and principles of inclusivity and equity.\u201d\n\nContinued campus fodder for taxpayer disgust\n\nTaxpayers may wonder what, exactly, about a truthful historical statement is beyond the bounds of university life, and why unelected educational bureaucrats get to decide what the university\u2019s values are. But more likely they will simply conclude that universities are silly places, not worthy of their tax dollars.", "description": "University campuses have abandoned their central mission in their pursuit of utopia.
