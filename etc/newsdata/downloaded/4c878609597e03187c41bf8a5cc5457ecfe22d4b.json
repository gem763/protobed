We\u2019re looking at off-setting our carbon footprint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look at all the flights and all the journeys that everyone\u2019s made and the cumulative carbon. We\u2019re looking at how we do that.\u201d\n\nSir David, 93, said the approach made environmental and financial sense.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cFlying people is costly. So any decent organisation would be out of its mind if it didn\u2019t look at the number of flights and say, \u2018Is it really essential 15 people come out for that sort of thing?\u2019\n\nSeven Worlds One Planet launches on Sunday, when viewers will get to see the \u201csignature look\u201d created by the drones.\n\nSeries producer Scott Alexander says: \u201cI was determined to use them wherever we could. The technology has come on in leaps and bounds.\n\n\u201cThey fly for longer, fly further, are quiet and so small, you can put them in a backpack and take them everywhere.\n\n\"They give an intimate aerial view - a perspective you wouldn\u2019t normally get.\u201d\n\nSequences captured by drones include the spiralling techniques of humpback whales, orcas chasing a penguin and polar bears hunting Beluga whales.", "description": "New BBC show Seven Worlds One Planet took four years to shoot - with the producers trying to ensure as small a carbon footprint as possible", "authors": ["Nicola Methven", "Image", "Bbc Studios Chadden Hunter", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20660128.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Seven-Worlds-One-Planet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
