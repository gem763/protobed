Experts later confirmed it was part of a Vickers machine gun from World War One.\n\nIt had spent more than a century at the bottom of the canal after falling off a boat carrying weapons home from the trenches.\n\nSeveral crates of weapons had fallen into the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation waterway near Rotherham after the war, probably while on their way to be melted down following the Armistice.\n\nBilly Nixon (centre), 48, was fishing with his son Reece (far left and right), 14, in the canal in South Yorkshire when the pair found the rusty barrel of a World War One Vickers machine gun\n\nThe guns were made by Vickers Ltd for the British Army from the early 1900s, through both world wars, until 1960.\n\nThey were originally operated by as many as eight servicemen, one to fire the weapon, one to feed the ammunition and the rest to carry it and all its spare parts.\n\nAir-cooled version of the machine guns were used by Allied First World War fighter aircraft.\n\nMr Nixon said: 'I recognised it straightaway but that was nothing to the thrill of knowing we had dredged up a piece of history from its watery grave.\n\nExperts later confirmed it was part of a Vickers machine gun from World War One\n\n'I was lost for words when I was holding it in my hands. But I knew I had better call the cops and tell them what I had found.'\n\nAfter his fascinating find, some of his angling friend also tried their luck and 'caught' three more of the weapons.\n\nSome of them claim they will be back next week to see what else lies hidden in the depths.\n\nSince they were discontinued in the 1960s, Vickers machine guns have since become collectors items and World War One models in mint condition can sell for up to \u00a320,000.", "description": "Billy Nixon, 48, was fishing with his son Reece, 14, in the canal in South Yorkshire when the pair latched onto something heavy.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/11/20079718-0-image-a-2_1571828249830.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
