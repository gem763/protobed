The newest blazes come as state utility provider Pacific Gas and Electric Co moved forward with plans to cut power to around 740,000 customers across the state, hoping to cut back on the risk of further fires. Governor Gavin Newsom has blamed the necessity of that on years of mismanagement by the utility. The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) has a planned media briefing at 7.30am local time (which is about four hours from now).\n\nHere is a map of active fires in the Los Angeles area, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Second from left is the Saddleridge fire, which reports 1,600 burning and none contained at the moment.\n\n\n\nIn the cluster of three on the right, the middle fire is the Sandalwood fire, which has impacted 500 acres. It is 10 per cent contained, according to the department. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection map of fires in the Los Angeles area. Advertisement We've focused on the Saddleridge Fire and Sandalwood, but there are least eight fires that CALFIRE is responding to. The largest so far is the Briceburg Fire, which has impacted 4,905 acres, and is 28 per cent contained as of yesterday. The fire appears to be in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and relatively far away from major population centers. The Los Angeles Times reports that the Saddleridge fire has already burned numerous homes, and closed off two freeways. The Saddleridge fire was moving so fast through the northern foothills of the San Fernando Valley that it jumped into some neighborhoods before residents could be warned by police and firefighters. One resident, speaking to the newspaper, watched a two-story home burning overnight. \"That's my home\", the man said, indicating he had been in the residence just 15 minutes earlier. So what's fueling the rapid growth of these blazes?\n\n\n\nThe Santa Ana winds \u2014 extremely dry downslope winds that originate inland \u2014 have been flowing through, out towards the Pacific Ocean. We have seen gusts as high as 60 mph.\n\n\n\nThose winds have led to many parts of the region to be under red-flag warnings (meaning, they have particularly high fire risk). Overall this means that there are warm temperatures, low humidity, and stronger winds than usual. Even a cigarette could start a blaze in those conditions. Here's a look back at what authorities have said overnight as the Saddleridge Fire exploded north of Los Angeles. Los Angeles Police Department chief Michel Moore: \"We need people to leave now while they can.\" The fire jumped two freeways overnight, and an unknown number of homes have been destroyed. The primary area impacted so far is the Porter Ranch Neighborhood.

Chaz then watched the fire as it moved along the nearby canyon, which he enjoys hiking in. \"I've watched fires on the news,\" he said. \"But, this hits home. I live here.\" Here is what the devastating wildfires in California look like from the ground.\n\n\n\nWildfires aren't particularly uncommon in the United States, and any casual observer may notice that they seem to be increasing in regularity. There are a variety of reasons for this \u2014 including, of course, climate change and the various impacts that can have from drier conditions, less rainfall, and others. But, our simple tendency as humans to develop can fuel these blazes as well. That is partly what happened last year, where urban structures and leveling contributed to make it easier for fires to spread (and be more deadly, and damaging). Fighting these fires doesn't always just use water, by the way. Water is, of course, a major component but firefighters can use an array of methods to put out the fires before they can get worse. That includes high tech methods and low tech methods, like fire retardants \u2014 which mix fertilizer and red-dyed water \u2014 and fire lines \u2014 literally areas cleared by firefighter so there is less vegetation and brush for a wildfire to feed off of.\n\n\n\nI took a look at the moral and financial impacts of that last year as fire season took over. Take a look: As California\u2019s biggest ever wildfire burns, should inmates be fighting the blaze? Civil rights activists say that the incarcerated firefighters should be getting the same pay as their non-incarcerated peers. But, the programme can save the state up to $100m a year in firefighting costs And, one thing we saw last year was the use of a different kind of firefighter \u2014 prisoners.I took a look at the moral and financial impacts of that last year as fire season took over. Take a look: Advertisement It's not just humans being evacuated as a result of the Saddleridge Fire. Horses are being led to safety, too. This video was taken by Judy-Lee Chen Sang, where she saw the horses being led away form an equestrian center in a neighborhood near Los Angeles. Schools are being shut down as a result of the fires outside of Los Angeles. Included in there are several high schools \u2014 Bert Corona, Bert Corona Charter, Granada Hills Charter, Jane Adams Continuation, North Valley Military Institute \u2014 as well as colleges. Colleges that have been closed so far include Cal State University Northridge, and the Los Angeles Mission College. Some more incredible videos of the Saddleridge Fire.

One fatality has been supported, after a man had a heart attack amid the fires.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement The Independent was able to catch up with Judy-Lee Chen Sang, who posted a video of horses being evacuated from the fires.\n\n\n\nShe tells us: \"I was helping my niece who was house sitting 3 minutes from our home. The person\u2019s house the fire was coming up close. This is Zelzah just north of Rinaldi and there is an equestrian center. They were starting the staging & evacuation of the horses in the area. We are fine. The home was safe & the pets we evacuated 2 dogs & 3 cats are okay and back at their home with my niece.\"\n\n\n\nHere's the video she posted online: Yet another glimpse of things on the ground in California today.\n\n\n\nAnother look:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease allow a moment for our liveblog to load", "description": "Wildfires have forced thousands to evacuate northern Los Angeles communities, after a blaze spread from 60 acres to 1,600 acres within hours.
