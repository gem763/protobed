Exploding enemy targets with precision artillery, \u201clasing\u201d ground targets for drone air attack and waging close-combat urban warfare with hand-carried small arms -- are all scenarios entertained recently in high-tech virtual training wargame designed to closely replicate anticipated future warfare.\n\nThe exercise, intended to virtually \u201ccreate\u201d high-threat, multi-domain modern warfare, was intended to move the Army closer to its goal of engineering a new \u201cforce-on-force\u201d mobile training technology designed to prepare soldiers for the risks and perils of a new kind of war.\n\n\u201cThis was a computer-based simulation down to the individual model -- using real-time data and responding in a real-world manner,\u201d Col. Chris Cassibry, Maneuver Capabilities Development and Integration Directorate's Concepts Development Division director, recently told reporters.\n\nThe August, 2019 experiment, called \u201cUnified Challenge Simulation Experiment,\u201d aligns entirely with the kind of soldier-centric virtual training sought after by the Army, as explained in an Army Needs Statement from earlier this year. In the statement, the Army calls for a specific technical ability to design virtual training systems \u201cbased on accurate hit/kill probabilities and on accurate damage and casualty assessments.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to present the most realistic, future-oriented simulation, the experiment included weapons systems which do not yet exist, Cassibry said -- such as advanced robots, future combat vehicles and AI-enabled armed platforms. While a large-scale simulated experiment, the Army\u2019s Unified Challenge effort is closely aligned with the Army Needs Statement because it was heavily centered upon individual soldiers and how they can best leverage virtual training for increased effectiveness in combat. Part of this, as explained in the Army needs statement, involves an integration between dismounted soldiers, weapons systems and larger platforms.\n\nGrenade-launcher attacks, land-mine threats, short-range indirect fire operations, mortar combat, small arms engagements and air-ground \u201cnetworking\u201d for dismounted soldiers are all key details outlined in the Army\u2019s statement of need. The Army\u2019s solicitation calls for technology that can create an \u201caccurate representation of munitions trajectory and time of flight with near real-time data exchange.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Think Russia, China, North Korea or anyone.", "authors": ["Kris Osborn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eDLSap6zM9UWKa2jhMhwQA--~B/aD0xMTUyO3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/19971458e2dbc4e523cdaf14026c08a8", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
