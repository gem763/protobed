However, several sources have confirmed to the Guardian that the IOC\u2019s draft guidelines have been parked, for now, because the whole subject is so politically charged and sensitive.\n\nUnder the current IOC guidelines, issued in November 2015, athletes who transition from male to female can compete in the women\u2019s category without requiring surgery to remove their testes provided their total testosterone level in serum is kept below 10 nanomoles per litre for at least 12 months.\n\nRussia at risk of Tokyo Olympics ban over \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Moscow lab data Read more\n\nThose guidelines, used by most sports federations to draw up their transgender policies, have proved controversial, given that women\u2019s testosterone levels tend to range between 0.12 and 1.79 nmol/l, while men\u2019s are typically between 7.7 to 29.4 nmol/l.\n\nThe Guardian understands some scientists on the IOC panel have argued that reducing the permitted testosterone levels to 5nmol/L \u2013 below most males \u2013 would provide a reasonable compromise between inclusion and fairness, ensuring that trans women could still compete in the women\u2019s category while taking away most of the advantages of undergoing male puberty.\n\nHowever, others disagree, pointing to the emerging findings from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, which show that testosterone suppression for transgender women has little effect on reducing muscle strength even after a year of treatment. That indicates that at least some of the physical advantages of those who have gone through male puberty are maintained even after transitioning.\n\nOne source told the Guardian that the draft IOC proposals \u201chad gone around the houses\u201d without getting anywhere and that it was unlikely that a new consensus position would be reached before the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nAnother said they were more hopeful but acknowledged that reaching an agreement had \u201cproved far more difficult than expected because this is such a tricky political and emotive issue\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian understands there will be meetings between now and Tokyo with the intention of getting individual sporting federations to create their own policies on transgender athletes. However, many governing bodies are reluctant to do anything without the IOC taking the lead in such a controversial area.\n\nSeveral high-profile athletes, including Martina Navratilova, Kelly Holmes and Paula Radcliffe, have also spoken out about the potential damage to women\u2019s sports by allowing trans women to compete when they are potentially bigger, stronger and faster having gone through male puberty. The British swimmer Sharron Davies, a silver medallist at the 1980 Olympics, put it earlier this year: \u201cI believe there is a fundamental difference between the binary sex you are born with and the gender you may identify as.\n\n\u201cTo protect women\u2019s sport, those with a male sex advantage should not be able to compete in women\u2019s sport.\u201d\n\nOthers, though, maintain that sport must strive to be as inclusive as possible and that, as things stand, there are very few trans women at the elite level. The transgender academic Joanna Harper has argued: \u201cTransgender women after hormone therapy are taller, bigger and stronger on average than cisgender women. But that does not necessarily make it unfair. In high levels of sport transgender women are substantially under-represented. That indicates that, whatever physical advantages transgender women have \u2013 and they certainly exist \u2013 they are not nearly as large as the sociological disadvantages.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nJust about the only thing all sides agree on is the need for more scientific research. Many sports are wary about how best to respond to the issue. Last year Hannah Mouncey, a former member of the Australian men\u2019s handball team, was blocked from playing in Australian rules football\u2019s professional women\u2019s league on the grounds of strength and physique.\n\nHowever, Laurel Hubbard, a New Zealand weightlifter who competed in men\u2019s competition before transitioning at the age of 35, was allowed to take part in the 2018 Commonwealth Games and recent Asian games, where she won the overall gold in the 90+kg category.", "description": "Draft proposals by the IOC for transgender athletes have \u2018gone around the houses\u2019 and it is thought unlikely a new consensus position will be reached before Tokyo 2020", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bde18da8a79e71c9fcc682dd0b5f53699d753cf3/451_510_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5899b66d117876131e07ccb269594f40", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
