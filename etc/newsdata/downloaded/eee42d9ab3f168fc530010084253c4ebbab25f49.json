That's what we're looking to do.'\n\nHe said successes in the 12 trial areas could be quickly rolled out to other branches.\n\nMr Rowse continued: 'We believe in the future that branches will be a lot more about education \u2013 about helping people with those things that are the most important in their life \u2013 whether it's: 'I'm opening my first account' or: 'I'm going off to university'\u2026 or: 'I'm starting a business'\u2026\n\n'We're really working with the local community to find out what it is that they want.'\n\nBarclays said 'pop-up' banking facilities to help communities will also appear at 300 locations by the end of 2021.\n\nBank branch and ATM closures generally have sparked fears about people's ability to continue to access cash.\n\nThe Post Office, which has around 11,500 branches, offers banking services on behalf of many banks, but some commentators in the access-to-cash debate have argued that this should not be seen as a direct replacement for banks' own branches.\n\nSome other banks and building societies have also recently announced initiatives to boost access to cash or keep branches open.\n\nIn March, Nationwide Building Society pledged that every town and city with a branch will still have one in May 2021.\n\nIn February, Lloyds Banking Group, in partnership with Visa, announced a pilot scheme to boost the number of retailers offering cashback.\n\nHere are the 12 pilot areas where Barclays is looking at how customer demand in branches could be increased: Yarm, Pickering and Guiseley in Yorkshire, Barnard Castle in County Durham, Wombourne and Kidsgrove in Staffordshire, Risca and Tredegar in South Wales, Shenfield and Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, Esher in Surrey and Biggin Hill in London.\n\nBank branches Barclays have pledged to protect Last in town branches: Alderley Edge Bargoed Barnard Castle Barnoldswick Biggin Hill Bilbrook Builth Wells Burnham-on-Crouch Cadishead Carnforth Chalfont St Peter Cockermouth Cuffley Drayton, Norwich Dunmow Esher Flitwick Guiseley Haxby Hemsworth Heywood Histon Holmes Chapel Hoyland, Nether Kidsgrove Knowle Llandeilo Pickering Radlett Risca Saltburn-by-the-Sea Shenfield South Woodham Ferrers Southwick St Ives Tredegar Treorchy Wadebridge Watton West Mersea Whickham Woburn Sands Wombourne Wroxham Yarm Ystrad Mynach Manningtree Llangollen Bentham Keswick Harleston Southwold Bedale Leyburn Framlingham Oundle Kirkby Stephen Seahouses Leiston Haltwhistle Stanhope Middleton-in-Teesdale Remote branches: Bideford Brecon Brigg Caernarfon Camborne Chipping Norton Cranleigh Daventry Deal Devizes Driffield Easingwold Falmouth Gainsborough Heathfield Helmsley Helston Horncastle Kirkby Lonsdale Lampeter Launceston Leek Malton Market Drayton Mildenhall Monmouth Pocklington Porthmadog Prudhoe Pwllheli Richmond, North Yorkshire Settle Shaftesbury Sheerness Sleaford Stow-on-the-Wold Tenby Thirsk Towcester Ulverston Welshpool Whitby Workington\n\nBarclays bosses deliver hammer blow to struggling Post Offices by stopping savers from withdrawing cash at branches\n\nBy Amelia Murray, Money Mail Chief Reporter for MailOnline\n\nBarclays drove another nail into the Post Office network's coffin \u2013 as it prepared to ban its savers from withdrawing cash at local branches.\n\nIn yet another blow to rural and elderly customers, the high street giant yesterday confirmed that it will this week tell customers they won't be able to take money out at their local Post Office from January.\n\nFurious campaigners accused the bank \u2013 which last year made \u00a33.5billion in profit before tax \u2013 of prioritising its bottom line over serving its customers.\n\nThey warned that those in rural and isolated communities, who often already have limited access to bank branches and cash machines, would be worst hit.\n\nBarclays drove another nail into the Post Office network's coffin \u2013 as it prepared to ban its savers from withdrawing cash at local branches (file image)\n\nExperts have warned that Britain is on the brink of sleepwalking into a cashless society within the next 15 years.\n\nThe UK has lost a third of its bank branches in the last five years, according to Which?. The consumer group estimated that Barclays has closed 481 sites during that period \u2013 33 per cent of its network \u2013 although the bank has refused to disclose an official figure.\n\nOne in ten free cash machines also closed or started charging customers between January 2018 and May 2019.\n\nIn July this year MPs on the Treasury Select Committee called for banks to pay for Britain's 11,500 Post Offices to act as proxy branches.\n\nThey criticised the Government for failing to hold banks to account for leaving millions of rural customers without some basic banking services.When banks close branches they typically point customers towards local Post Offices as many offer simple cash and cheque services.\n\nBarclays said customers will still be able to deposit cheques and cash and check balances \u2013 but will not be able to withdraw money with debit cards. Customers can currently take out up to \u00a3300 a day over the counter using their card.\n\nA small number of customers with a special cheque book may still be able to access cash, but those with ordinary cheque books will not, Barclays added.\n\nNatalie Ceeney, of the Access to Cash Review, said: 'The cash system that supports communities must be cherished, not undermined. It is for that reason that I urge Barclays to reconsider.'\n\nMartyn James, of complaints service Resolver, added: 'In doing this, Barclays is putting profits before its customers. Access to cash is essential to people, especially the elderly or vulnerable.' Last year Barclays Group made \u00a33.5billion in profit before tax. The bank's chief executive Jes Staley earned \u00a33.4million, down \u00a3500,000 on the previous year because his bonus was docked after he tried to unmask a whistleblower.\n\nIn July this year MPs on the Treasury Select Committee called for banks to pay for Britain's 11,500 Post Offices to act as proxy branches\n\nBarclays was one of the banks hardest hit by the PPI scandal and has paid out \u00a39.2billion since 2011.\n\nIt is expected to pay out another \u00a3360million, but could be forced to increase this if the number of genuine victims is higher than expected.\n\nBarclays denied its decision was to do with cost-cutting and said it was investing in schemes to help its customers access their cash. Last night the bank pledged not to close any more branches in remote areas, or where it is the last bank in town, for the next two years.\n\nIt will also introduce a cashback scheme in 200 locations in January, which will allow customers in remote areas to withdraw cash from local businesses. The Post Office is expected to make an announcement on the changes this week.\n\nThe Mail is campaigning to save rural post offices and the services they offer to remote communities.\n\nAdam Rowse, managing director of branch-based banking for Barclays, said: 'By maintaining last-in-town or remote branches over the next two years, and working with the community, we hope to increase demand and keep these branches viable.'\n\nA spokesman for banking trade body UK Finance said: 'The industry is committed to ensuring access to cash remains free and widely accessible for those that continue to need it.'\n\nEarlier this month, ATM network provider LINK launched a scheme, funded by banks and building societies, to enable remote communities to request a free cash machine.", "description": "The bank will also launch a new cashback scheme - but said a facility allowing customers to withdraw cash over the counter at Post Offices will end.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/02/wire-19421734-1570499317-325_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
