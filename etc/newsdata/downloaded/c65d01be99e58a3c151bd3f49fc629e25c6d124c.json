By then, the results of the team\u2019s remaining few contestants will be known.\n\nAt the time of going to print, the men\u2019s 4x400m relay was due to line up in the heats last night with the hope that they would have progressed to the medal contest on the final day.\n\nMiddle-distance runner Dominique Scott was also due to race in the women\u2019s 5 000m final last night, while 100m hurdler Rikenette Steenkamp was also scheduled to start her campaign.\n\nAlthough the task appeared to be daunting in Doha, it still seemed impossible considering the talent in the group that was picked for the championships. Expectations were that sprinter Simbine and long jumpers Luvo Manyonga and Ruswahl Samaai would bring back medals. However, all of them fell short of their targets (see sidebar).\n\nThere is no denying the fact that the absence of defending world champions Caster Semenya and Wayde van Niekerk was felt. In the words of veteran jumper Khotso Mokoena: \u201cAll is not lost, but a few aspects can bring about hope looking ahead to the Tokyo Olympics next year.\n\n\u201cFor next year, we\u2019ll probably pull away with some medals if we get a few things right as Team SA,\u201d said Mokoena, an Olympic silver medallist.\n\n\u201cWe must first have a solid stable domestic season, followed by consistent training camps as a team. Training camps give the feel of the championships, but, at the moment, I think there is not enough base support.\u201d\n\nAt least Athletics SA (ASA) had the relay team on a week-long training camp in Italy before the Doha championships, and it showed in their performances.\n\n\u201cWe have to look into punching a lot of support into the sport and make athletes feel that there is enough base support,\u201d said Mokoena, adding that he would give it another try and qualify in the long jump for Tokyo next year.\n\nThere were a few positives from Doha, though, with sprinter Dlodlo (20) and 400m hurdles rising star Zen\u00e9y van der Walt (19) emerging as runners to keep an eye on.\n\nASA officials might argue that there is no need to feel embarrassed by Team SA\u2019s performances in Doha, but if the athletes return empty-handed, the federation\u2019s president, Aleck Skhosana, would have presided over the worst showing by a track and field team since the championships in Osaka, Japan, in 2007.\n\nEven the return of a single medal would have matched the 2013 edition, where the team ended the championships with an unlikely gong \u2013 the 1 500m bronze from Johan Cronje.\n\nASA has 10 months to get it right for the Olympics.", "description": "If athletes come back empty handed from Qatar, it will be SA\u2019s worst showing since the championship in Osaka, Japan, in 2007.", "authors": ["Daniel Mothowagae"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/c2cac3f06c9343ae9a44b32f04b252b1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
