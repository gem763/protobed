And centrists were to blame | Bhaskar Sunkara", "language": "en", "text": "Thursday\u2019s debate was difficult to get through, kind of like watching season five of a sitcom you used to like. Scenes are dragging on, characters you came to love have grown tiresome, but still you keep tuning in.\n\n\n\nLike sitcom characters, the Democratic candidates tried to awkwardly slot in their favorite punchlines: Kamala Harris blasted Trump looking for a meme-able moment (\u201cyou can go back to watching Fox News\u201d), Beto started talking unprompted in Spanish, Bernie threw in a \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u201d for good measure.\n\nThrough it all, I started to think about how other countries did their elections. The longest election campaign in Canadian history lasted 74 days. The French can\u2019t be bothered to deal with this stuff for more than 14. Yet our series never seems to end, no matter how bad it gets.\n\nFor much of the debate, it would have been hard for someone tuning in for the first time to tell the candidates apart. A Juli\u00e1n Castro outburst aside, most Democrats stuck to banal slogans that most party backers would agree with. They spoke about their personal experiences, shared suspiciously pithy lessons imparted from their parents, and other inspiring cliches (\u201cA house divided will not stand\u201d).\n\n\n\nThe glimmers of life, however, came because of the presence of one them in particular.\n\n\n\nThe entrance of Bernie Sanders has injected new life into the show. As Clinton supporters were keen to remind people in 2016, \u201che\u2019s not even a real Democrat.\u201d But maybe that\u2019s why his presence has had such an impact in the party.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine what the opening portion of the debate \u2013 an actually lively discussion around healthcare \u2013 would have sounded like without him. Though most rejected his call for Medicare for All and favored some form of public option instead, Sanders was actually invoked respectfully by most candidates (no doubt aware of his own popularity and that of the proposal).\n\nBernie himself was hoarse and not his usual self. But his impact was exactly what he had in mind when he decided to run for president in 2016. \u201cFour years ago,\u201d he told ABC after the debate, \u201cI decided that I didn\u2019t want the Democratic primary to be a place in which the needs of working people were not represented.\u201d He discussed how his key issues \u2013 Medicare for All, climate change, good jobs \u2013 had become mainstream. And how he wants to continue to lay out the \u201cneed to take on the very powerful corporate elite\u201d.\n\nBut in the long period in the middle of the debate, when he was seemingly iced out by the debate moderators, the Democrats sounded like, well, Democrats. They spoke to their base, they took few strong stances, they entirely avoided income inequality and the financial pressures that cause so much anxiety for working people. The economy eventually played a role, starting in the last hour, but only on issues of trade, with Trump\u2019s tariffs at the forefront. The triangulated statements meant to offend as few people as possible that the ensuing discussion inspired sounded like the party debates I\u2019ve heard for decades.\n\nEarly on in this primary season, many Democrats have tacked to the left. But tonight was a reminder that the equivocating core of the party has not yet been vanquished.\n\nThe debates will hopefully get more substantive as the race narrows. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren will have to take a more confrontational approach with Biden, and also differentiate themselves from each other. But for now, we\u2019re stuck shifting through interminable debates to find a few glimmers of politics.\n\nThe issues being discussed couldn\u2019t be more urgent. Over 2 million Americans are in prison, 30 million don\u2019t have health insurance, 40 million live in poverty, millions more are overworked and one disaster away from total destitution. But you don\u2019t hear that anxiety or that sense of anger from the \u201cmainstream\u201d candidates. What you hear is the sound of people trying hard not to lose.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen where that approach leads.", "description": "Thursday\u2019s debate was a reminder that the equivocating core of the party has not yet been vanquished", "authors": ["Bhaskar Sunkara"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6596c3eb280e37894db682d7577fad7d455445/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cf1a7af30cccfd198b971ad06cfeee38", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
