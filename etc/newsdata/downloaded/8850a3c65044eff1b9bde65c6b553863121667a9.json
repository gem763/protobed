But though there was no claim of responsibility, suspicion for the attack fell on Iranian-allied Shia militias that largely control the southern Baghdad neighbourhood from which the projectiles were fired.\n\n\"We have made clear that attacks on Coalition personnel and facilities will not be tolerated and Coalition Forces retain the right to defend ourselves,\u201d said a statement issued by US-led forces combating Isis remnants in Iraq.\n\nIn Tehran, the talk is increasingly of a potential armed conflict with the West.\n\n\u201cToday, enemies, who are fearful of a war with Iran, have taken the path of economic terrorism,\" Maj Gen Mohammad Baqeri, Iran\u2019s army chief of staff, said in a fiery speech before parliament on Tuesday, according to the Tasnim news agency.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly warned the enemies that if they invade this country, the result of this invasion will be captivity and defeat.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Still, Brian Hook, the State Department\u2019s Iran envoy, said in a speech on Monday that the US stance was successful because it was \u201cmaking the regime\u2019s extremist foreign policy and the ideology that drives it more expensive than ever before.\u201d\n\nThough European nations said they opposed Mr Trump\u2019s Iran policy, they have largely submitted to the US restrictions, declining to encourage or allow any trade that would spark the ire of Washington.\n\nFor a year, Iran abided by the terms of the nuclear deal, even as Europeans failed to come up with a mechanism that would allow trade.\n\nBut since May, Iran and its allies began ratcheting up tensions in the Persian Gulf with the seizures of ships and alleged attacks on vessels, while Tehran slowly lowered its adherence to the nuclear deal by ramping up the enrichment of uranium.\n\nThe attack on the Saudi oil facilities in Abqaiq appeared to have spooked Europe, and possibly changed the calculations of leaders in Western capitals.\n\n\u201cIt is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack,\u201d said the joint statement by London, Paris and Berlin.\n\n\u201cThere is no other plausible explanation. These attacks may have been against Saudi Arabia but they concern all countries and increase the risk of a major conflict.\u201d\n\nStill both Europe and Iran remained open to talks. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani was scheduled to hold a meeting in New York with Mr Johnson after conferring on Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to continuing our diplomatic efforts to create conditions and facilitate dialogue with all relevant partners interested in de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East,\u201d said the joint statement.\n\nThe husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a dual British-Iranian national detained in Tehran in 2016, urged Mr Johnson to use his scheduled meeting with the Iranian president to call for his wife\u2019s release, and said it was time for the former foreign secretary to make amends.\n\nRichard Ratcliffe said that Mr Johnson \"didn't take any responsibility for his mistakes\" as foreign secretary.\n\nMr Johnson said Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran \"teaching people journalism\" - despite her family's insistence she was there to visit relatives.\n\n\"I will not only be discussing Iran's actions in the region, but also the need to release not just Nazanin but others who in our view are being illegally and unfairly held in Tehran,\" Mr Johnson said upon his arrival in New York on Sunday.", "description": "Threats and warnings between Tehran and Western powers spiked on Tuesday amid frustration over the regional military activities of Iran and its partners, as well as Europe\u2019s continued failure to abide by the terms of a 2015 nuclear deal it seeks to uphold.", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/12/Iran-Rouhani.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
