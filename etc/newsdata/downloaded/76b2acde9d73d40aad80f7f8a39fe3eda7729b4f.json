The issue affects phones manufactured by Samsung, including the Galaxy S7, S8, and S9, as well as the Huawei P20, Pixel 1, and Pixel 2. An Android spokesperson said that an attacker would either need to get their target to install a malicious application or pair the attack with a second exploit via a program like a web browser. At that point, the exploit achieves \u201cfull compromise\u201d of a device.\n\nInstances of the exploit being used in the real world were discovered by Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group, which suggests that the exploit may have been used or sold by the NSO Group, an Israeli-based spyware vendor which was most recently behind a piece of spyware that can be injected into a phone via a WhatsApp call.\n\nThe bug was previously patched in December 2017\n\nWhen contacted for comment by The Verge, the NSO Group denied that it had any involvement with the exploit. \u201cNSO did not sell and will never sell exploits or vulnerabilities,\u201d a spokesperson said, \u201cThis exploit has nothing to do with NSO; our work is focused on the development of products designed to help licensed intelligence and law enforcement agencies save lives.\u201d\n\nSince the bug is already being used by an exploit out in the real world, Google\u2019s security researchers only gave the Android team seven days to fix it before making their findings public. The bug was first disclosed to the Android team on September 27th, and it was made public today.\n\nIn an odd twist, the researchers said that the same bug had previously been patched in December 2017, but it appears to have reemerged in subsequent versions of the Android kernel.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of devices that Project Zero believes are affected by the hack. However, the team notes that this list is \u201cnon-exhaustive\u201d:\n\nPixel 1\n\nPixel 1 XL\n\nPixel 2\n\nPixel 2 XL\n\nHuawei P20\n\nXiaomi Redmi 5A\n\nXiaomi Redmi Note 5\n\nXiaomi A1\n\nOppo A3\n\nMoto Z3\n\nAndroid Oreo LG phones\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8\n\nSamsung Galaxy S9\n\nIn a comment responding to the bug, a spokesperson for the Android team confirmed that it was a \u201chigh severity\u201d issue. They added that a patch is now available on the Android Common Kernel and that Android partners have been informed. \u201cPixel 1 and 2 devices will be receiving updates for this issue as part of the October update,\u201d they said, adding that Pixel 3 and 3A devices are not affected.\n\nUpdate October 4th, 10:45AM ET: Updated with statement from NSO Group denying any involvement with the exploit.", "description": "Security researchers with Google\u2019s Project Zero team have disclosed an Android vulnerability that appears to have been exploited in the real world.
