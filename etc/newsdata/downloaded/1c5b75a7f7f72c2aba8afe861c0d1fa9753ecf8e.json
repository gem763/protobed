It makes me angry,\" Sutton said in a column in the Daily Mail newspaper.\n\n\"Angry for people like my dad, Mike, and other former footballers who are dying in the most horrible and humiliating way. Angry for the future generations who will suffer, too, because this study was rolled out 15 years too late.\"\n\nSutton said a study should have been commissioned in 2002 after Astle's death.\n\n\"The PFA, led by Gordon Taylor, had a duty of care to their members,\" Sutton said. \"They let them down.\"\n\nHe added: \"My dad, a former Norwich player, is suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- a degenerative disease of the brain caused by repetitive brain trauma. He is 75 and first developed symptoms of dementia when he was still in his sixties.\"\n\nJeff Astle's daughter, Dawn, who has been campaigning since her father's death for football to research into the area, said she was \"staggered\" to learn of the findings.\n\n\"My overall feeling is that I am staggered even though my own research and instinct was always that there was a serious problem,\" she said.\n\n\"There will be no celebrations. It doesn't bring my dad back, it won't bring any other dads and husbands back.\n\n\"We knew dad could not be the only one. We just wanted that question answered.\"", "description": "Former England international Chris Sutton has accused Professional Footballers' Association chief Gordon Taylor of letting players down after a landmark study showing the link between football and dementia.
