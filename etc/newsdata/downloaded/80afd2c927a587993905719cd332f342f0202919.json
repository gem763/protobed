It\u2019s been a marvellous tournament so far\u201d.\n\nIt will be 28 days between the All Blacks\u2019 opening pool win over South Africa and their quarter-final with only matches against minnows Canada and Namibia in between.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing that happens now is how we adapt and adjust to it,\u201d Hansen said of the shortage of quality match play.\n\n\u201cThe players have to get their heads round the fact we\u2019re not playing and the coaching group have to get our heads round the fact we\u2019re not playing and adjust our preparation accordingly.\u201d\n\nHansen refused to reveal the team he was due to announce Thursday to play Italy.\n\nBut he did confirm the cancellation affected lock Brodie Retallick and centre Jack Goodhue, who only recently returned from injury and were in need of more game time.\n\nThe two points New Zealand have received for a match deemed a draw mean they will advance as Pool B winners ahead of South Africa.\n\nThe All Blacks now face a quarter-final against the runner-up in Pool A \u2014 a three-way battle between Japan, Ireland and Scotland.\n\nIreland\u2019s final pool game against Samoa will go ahead on the southern island of Kyushu on Saturday while the fate of the crunch match between Japan and Scotland on Sunday has yet to be decided.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 England coach Eddie Jones said Super Typhoon Hagibis had given his team a \u201cgreat opportunity\u201d on Thursday after their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/c9e20d_eddie-jones-typhoon-gods-england-boss-typhoon-gods-world-cup-game-axed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
