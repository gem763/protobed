(AP) - At the end of his second season, Seattle Seahawks cornerback Shaquill Griffin knew he had to make changes.\n\nHe was trying too hard. He weighed too much. He had clearly taken a step back after a promising rookie year.\n\nAlong with his brother Shaquem, Griffin significantly altered everything from his diet to his workout regimen during the offseason. He needed to be lighter and quicker if he was to fulfill the promise of being Seattle\u2019s next standout cornerback.\n\nSo far this season, the work seems to have had the desired effect. Griffin is slimmer. He is faster. And through four games he\u2019s playing at a level more in line with what he had expected after his first year.\n\n\u201cHe looks really active; he\u2019s made consistent plays,\u201d coach Pete Carroll said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen him knock balls down kind of in consistent fashion almost week in and week out. Doing a good job on top, on the deep balls. He\u2019s playing great football, I think.\u201d\n\nGriffin and the rest of Seattle\u2019s secondary have already faced a couple of difficult tests through four weeks. But Thursday night brings the toughest challenge to date when Los Angeles visits for a big divisional showdown, just days after Rams quarterback Jared Goff tied an NFL record with 45 completions and threw for 517 yards in a loss to Tampa Bay.\n\nWith the likes of Robert Woods, Brandin Cooks and Cooper Kupp, there\u2019s no doubt Seattle\u2019s secondary will be tested.\n\n\u201cWe need to be involved in games like this. If you\u2019re going to have a good season, you\u2019ve got to be able to match up and play these kinds of games and do a good job. I\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d Carroll said.\n\nGriffin said the biggest and most important change he made during the offseason was dropping nearly 20 pounds. Griffin played last year at around 212 pounds but started this season around 195.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still early, so I\u2019m still doing different things to take care of my body the correct way,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cBut it feels good to be out there, to move the way I am, and as fast as I\u2019m moving, and be able to keep my endurance up all at the same time. Last year, the weight that I was at, I would get so fatigued so fast and that\u2019s the part of my game that I took out.\u201d\n\nGriffin was carrying some mental weight a year ago as well. With the departure of Richard Sherman after his rookie season, Griffin had to step into his mentor\u2019s role. He took the same spot on the defense as Sherman and with it came expectations of playing at that level. Instead of thriving, though, Griffin struggled.\n\nHe was rated near the bottom among cornerbacks around the league by some analytics. This year has been a bounce back so far.\n\nGriffin has only three passes defensed - the same as Jadeveon Clowney - but opponents haven\u2019t thrown his way often. When they have, Griffin has avoided getting beat in the ways he was last year.\n\nHe\u2019s matured and the Seahawks are benefiting.\n\n\u201cDefinitely a little difference from the first couple of years,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going in the right direction, keeping my mind in the right direction; and what I need to do and what I need to focus on. Being that team player, all of my thoughts are about the team. What can I do for the team? I don\u2019t have any thoughts that are speaking on myself, and that\u2019s the type of player I need to be.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At the end of his second season, Seattle Seahawks cornerback Shaquill Griffin knew he had to make changes.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/seahawks_griffin_football_59648_c0-217-4610-2904_s1770x1032.jpg?bb17d3740f2b3e21eb5322c380ad376a469fa6cb", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
