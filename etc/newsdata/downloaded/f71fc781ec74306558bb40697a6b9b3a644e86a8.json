(Picture: Getty)\n\nJeffree Star has revealed that he raked in over $20 million from his most popular eye shadow palette and we\u2019re honestly shook.\n\nThe beauty mogul, who has more than 16.1 million subscribers on YouTube, is the star of digital documentary series The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star made by fellow content creator Shane Dawson.\n\nInvestigating life behind-the-scenes at his make-up company Jeffree Star Cosmetics, the second episode in the series saw Shane grill the star on just how much his beauty business was raking in.\n\n\u2018How much\u2026 do you think you take home for your biggest palette,\u2019 the presenter asked Jeffree, prompting the beauty guru to ponder his answer.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s hard to say on one specific one,\u2019 he replied, \u2018I\u2019d have to do a little number work.\u2019\n\nFinally offering up his answer on an iPhone calculator (how else is he supposed to count his millions?), Jeffree revealed that he had taken home a staggering $20,800,000 (around \u00a3168 million) from one palette alone.\n\nJeffree opened up to Shane in the documentary series (Picture: shane/Youtube)\n\nHonestly, we had to re-watch that clip multiple times just to even comprehend that number.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEver the humble star, Jeffree admitted that you could \u2018probably shave a million or two off of that\u2019 to cover the cost of his goods, which obviously makes all the difference (or not).\n\nHowever, $20 million made off of stock costing a maximum of $2 million? Now that\u2019s impressive.\n\nFirst launching in 2014 selling matte liquid lipsticks, Jeffree Star Cosmetics has grown exponentially over the years, with the influencer and make up artist now selling a full collection including highlighters, eyeshadows and even tracksuits emblazoned with his logo.\n\nEven after losing $2.5 million worth of stock in April, just imagine how much that must all be making him.\n\nIf you fancy lending us a tenner Jeffree, just let us know.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
