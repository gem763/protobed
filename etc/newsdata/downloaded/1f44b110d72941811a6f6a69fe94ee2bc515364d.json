White dismissed the content of the rumors and chalked everything up to \u201chead games\u201d being played by the former champion.\n\n\u201cThere were what I will call \u2018head games\u2019 going on behind the scenes,\u201d White said. \u201cThe problem with this whole story and everything going on is never, ever, ever was there a thing that Joanna couldn\u2019t make weight. There was never a situation where Joanna couldn\u2019t make weight. That was never an issue.\n\n\u201cThen I saw a story that said we were going to pay her fines if she didn\u2019t make weight. That will never happen. I\u2019m never paying fines for people who didn\u2019t make weight. That\u2019s a lie. That\u2019s never going to happen ever.\u201d\n\nWhite even criticized the UFC\u2019s own broadcast partner, ESPN, for running information on its ticker, which he alleges stated Jedrzejczyk missed weight.\n\n\u201cYesterday (Thursday), my partner ESPN put up on their ticker tape \u2018Joanna Jedrzejczyk didn\u2019t make weight,'\u201d White said. \u201cThe weigh-ins are today (Friday). It\u2019s been crazy, man. What has been happening is there has been some head games going on between two veterans who are fighting in the main event of a fight that is very important in both of their careers and to see who gets the next title shot. That\u2019s literally what is going on.\n\n\u201cAnd all of these MMA suckers fall for it because they\u2019re hearing things behind the scenes or whatever is going on. None of it is true.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 19 takes place Saturday at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla.
