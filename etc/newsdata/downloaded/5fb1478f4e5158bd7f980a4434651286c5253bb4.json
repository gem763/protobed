There\u2019s a bit more troubling the subprime lender than just a modest slowdown.\n\nFirst, the background: Amigo offers loans to people with bad credit histories so long as they can secure a guarantor to step in if they get into trouble with repayments. Friends, family, you know the drill.\n\nIt will lend up to \u00a310,000 at an APR interest rate of just under 50 per cent.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBusiness was booming until quite recently, with a successful flotation at 275p, which made a billionaire of founder James Benamor and attracted some big name investors.\n\nSince then, it has been a rocky ride. Before yesterday\u2019s update, the shares were trading at less than half their near 300p peak. They\u2019ve since halved again.\n\nA major reason for that is this sort of lending coming under the beady eye of the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nThe regulator has voiced concerns about the growth of the market, the loans\u2019 affordability, the high incidence of repeat loans lenders like Amigo have on their books.\n\nHard-up borrowers can easily get into a cycle of borrowing, and then borrowing again, which sucks money out of already strained budgets.\n\nThe watchdog also worries about whether guarantors really know what they\u2019re getting into. They are themselves often of limited means. Becoming liable for a loved one\u2019s loan repayments is a headache many of them could do without.\n\nYou can see why investors initially got excited by the company. It currently has 210,000 customers. There could be 10 million of them in its sector. Amigo and its peers have created a market among them that barely existed before its emergence, one that has been booming. Whether that\u2019s a good thing is open to debate.\n\nThe problem with the \u201csubprime\u201d sector is that there is within it a substantial number of people who really shouldn\u2019t be borrowing at all, who are inclined to take out loans to make ends meet rather than to fulfil a purpose (such as buying a car to get a better job).\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

A notable feature of the results is an impairment ratio of more than 30 per cent of revenues, up from 25.4 per cent and a deterioration of the proportion of loan balances fully up to date or less than 31 days overdue.\n\nCEO Hamish Paton characterises Amigo\u2019s offering as \u201ca valuable product that improves [customers\u2019] lives by giving them fair and transparent access to credit\u201d.\n\nIf that were so, why the need for a reset, which involves improving \u201ccredit and conduct policies\u201d and prioritising new customers over relending to existing ones?\n\nThe watchdog has already capped what payday lenders can charge. It followed up with a move on stores operating in the \u201crent to own\u201d sector. The charges imposed on those whose bank accounts slip into the red via \u201cunauthorised\u201d overdrafts have similarly been addressed.\n\n\u201cYou can expect us to be consistent and predictable in our focus on affordability,\u201d is what it has said on the subject of guarantor loans.
