It would also ensure gas for a potential gas peaking plant at Liddell or at Tomago near Newcastle to help fill the gap when the Liddell coal generator shuts down, and provide a route to market for Narrabri gas and beef up supplies for the Colongra gas power generator on the Central Coast.\n\n\"Ours ticks all the boxes,\" Mr Simonian said. APA's proposed Western Slopes line, which has yet to be approved, would run from Narrabri towards the south-west to connect into the existing Moomba-Sydney pipeline, without any connection to Queensland.\n\nOnly one of the lines is expected to proceed, given construction will need to be underpinned by gas transportation contracts.\n\nHunter Gas, owned by Mr Simonian and five private investors, has an existing memorandum of understanding with APA's rival Jemena to build the line. But Mr Simonian said the group was considering other options and could seek to develop the project itself, with a target of having it operational in late 2022 or at least by the time Liddell closes, due in April 2023.\n\nAnnouncing the planning approval, which extends an earlier clearance that had lapsed, the state government described the project as \"critical\" for the NSW energy sector as it would increase energy security, diversify gas supply and put downward pressure on gas prices.\n\nIt would also provide greater competition between APA and Jemena, support regional development and \"facilitate the development of gas-fired dispatchable energy\" to support the growth of renewable energy, the government said.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Energy Market Operator have both warned that gas users in the south-east will become increasingly reliant on gas from Queensland as the Gippsland Basin fields owned by ExxonMobil and BHP run down. That means some industrial users in Victoria will need to pay an extra $2.50 a gigajoule to transport south from Queensland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut analysts are warning of a limited ability for Queensland to increase exports of gas to the south due to pipeline constraints in the existing system.\n\nMeanwhile, NSW government planning authorities are still in the process of considering Santos' Narrabri gas project, where Weston Energy, Brickworks and Perdaman Group have provisionally signed up for gas and other manufacturers are lining up as potential customers.", "description": "The pipeline would shave about 40 per cent off the cost of transporting gas from NSW to Queensland, according to its backer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_78/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a0fc59446844cebc32f8cf3034e4b8a8efd7c632", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
