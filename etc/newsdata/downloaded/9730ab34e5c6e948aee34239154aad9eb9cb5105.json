So the demands by 2020 presidential contenders to remove the Supreme Court justice, on the heels of new reporting about allegations of sexual misconduct, are getting panned.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cGet real,\u201d as Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) put it Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get beyond this \u2018impeachment is the answer to every problem.\u2019 It\u2019s not realistic,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cIf that\u2019s how we are identified in Congress, as the impeachment Congress, we run the risk that people will feel we\u2019re ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families.\u201d\n\nExcept for Kavanaugh\u2019s lone Democratic supporter, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Democratic lawmakers were livid about reports that the FBI did not thoroughly investigate two allegations against Kavanaugh. Many called for new probes into the Department of Justice, some demanded the FBI take up the matter and others hoped the House Judiciary Committee would begin some sort of investigation.\n\nBut the debate over impeachment may quickly come to a head.\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) said she will file an impeachment resolution on Tuesday, arguing that \u201cKavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process set a dangerous precedent. We must demand justice for survivors and hold Kavanaugh accountable for his actions.\u201d\n\nThe two-page resolution calls on the House Judiciary Committee to investigate whether Kavanaugh should be impeached, according to a draft obtained by POLITICO. The resolution grants the committee subpoena power in any impeachment inquiry of Kavanaugh.\n\nIt\u2019s going to land like a thud in the Capitol\u2019s leadership suites and with much of the party.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell would block any impeachment. So that\u2019s a moot point,\u201d said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), a former Judiciary chairman. He said the lesson to be learned is not to rush lifetime confirmations: \u201cDon\u2019t ever let those mistakes happen again.\u201d Until Democrats take back the Senate, however, there\u2019s little they can do to halt McConnell on nominations.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Among those pushing for impeachment or at least an inquiry included 2020 aspirants like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris as well as Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Jerry Nadler cares if somebody, particularly somebody is getting a lifetime appointment, whether that person lied to Congress,\u201d said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), who supports an impeachment inquiry. \u201cI hope he\u2019ll change his mind.\u201d\n\nThe top two Democratic leaders in Congress haven\u2019t touched the topic publicly and Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden stopped short of endorsing an impeachment inquiry. Several senior House aides said Democratic leaders, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have not discussed the recently disclosed Kavanaugh accusation \u2014 and what, if any, action the chamber should take.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Monday he would address the matter later: \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Which is nothing. I\u2019m saying nothing on Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats are not eager to wade into a battle that energizes conservatives, who quickly dismissed Democrats\u2019 impeachment calls. Though the effort to oust Kavanaugh is popular on the left and quickly became a litmus test in the presidential primary, Republicans indicated they relish the return of an issue they believe helped them keep the Senate in 2018.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is potentially vulnerable in his reelection bid next year, said \u201cthe left\u2019s most recent effort to destroy his life and impeach him will fail.\u201d The National Republican Senatorial Committee did fundraising off the early calls to get rid of Kavanaugh, urging donors: \u201cDon\u2019t let Democrats and the liberal media smear Justice Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chaired the Judiciary Committee during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, gave fiery speeches pushing back against the latest allegations. McConnell called them \u201cflimsy.\u201d\n\nGrassley told reporters his committee received only a letter telling them to talk to Max Stier, who The New York Times reported had witnessed Kavanaugh commit sexual assault at Yale. But Grassley said the letter contained no such allegation.\n\n\u201cYou impeach people for treason, high crimes and misdemeanors. What has he committed?\u201d Grassley said. \u201cThere were no allegations in this letter, so I\u2019m not sure what the FBI was supposed to investigate.\u201d\n\nThere were always indications the Democratic Party would return to Kavanaugh. Nadler told The New York Times just before Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation vote in October that he planned to thoroughly investigate the allegations, including subpoenaing White House and FBI records and interviewing the accusers. Kavanaugh\u2019s opponents hoped the Democratic House would quickly move on the matter.\n\nBut since regaining control of the House in January, Democrats have done little to revisit the issue. Nadler petitioned the National Archives last month to release a large cache of records from Kavanaugh\u2019s time in the George W. Bush administration, House Democrats\u2019 most significant step to date.\n\nNadler said the committee plans to press FBI Director Christopher Wray on the bureau\u2019s investigation into the allegations during a previously scheduled hearing next month. Last year Nadler called the FBI\u2019s investigation into the accusations a \u201cwhitewash\u201d but the New York Democrat made clear on Monday that impeaching Kavanaugh is not his top priority.\n\nThat\u2019s just fine with Senate leaders, who see little upside to impeachment.\n\n\u201cI understand their frustration. I was in the front row of the frustration crowd. They didn\u2019t produce the documents and the FBI didn\u2019t follow up on the investigation,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cWe\u2019re now getting pushed into the impeachment corner by the Republicans every chance they get.\u201d", "description": "Democratic leaders are panning new demands by the left to oust the Supreme Court justice.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett", "Heather Caygle"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e6/7e/934589f8490db6b45436b046a413/190916-durbin-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
