Donald Trump\u2019s man in Brussels talks about the prospects of a relationship \u201creset,\u201d trade tension, digital tax and much more.\n\nSondland has particularly strong words for the EU\u2019s incoming trade commissioner, Phil Hogan. He brands recent comments about Trump by the Irishman \u201cvery condescending.\u201d On France\u2019s push for a digital services tax, he pledges a \u201cvigorous\u201d attack and accuses Paris of trying to \u201cdip their dipper into the stream of cashflow\u201d from U.S. companies.\n\nAlthough he spoke before POLITICO broke the news that the World Trade Organization ruled in favor of the U.S. in a dispute over Airbus subsidies, the ambassador makes clear how he sees that battle playing out.\n\nSondland also talks about his conversations with the EU\u2019s incoming leadership team and about his own European heritage.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/EU-Confidential-homepage-v1-red.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
