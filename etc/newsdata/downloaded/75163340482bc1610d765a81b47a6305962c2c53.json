Rather, they were put to Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea \u2014 at an event supporting their book in praise of chicks with intestinal fortitude.\n\nOne of the people championed in The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience is Danica Roem \u2014 the first man identifying as a woman to be elected to an American state legislature.\n\nAnd while speaking with British reporter Decca Aitkenhead for a piece to be published in The Sunday Times, the two were quizzed on the aforementioned female adornments.\n\nAs noted by the Daily Mail, 39-year-old Chelsea didn\u2019t have to think about it for even a sec:\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n71-year-old Hillary, according to the DM, looked \u201cuneasy.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Hil climbed it:\n\n\u201cErrr. I\u2019m just learning about this. It\u2019s a very big generational discussion, because this is not something I grew up with or ever saw. It\u2019s going to take a lot more time and effort to understand what it means to be defining yourself differently.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just spitballin\u2019 here, but I believe that was a genuine answer.\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting bit about female and male from the Mail:\n\nAccording Aitkenhead\u2019s account, she tells Hillary during the interview that many British feminists of Hillary\u2019s generation have a problem with the idea that a \u201clesbian who doesn\u2019t want to sleep with someone who has a penis is transphobic.\u201d Hillary nods in agreement, while Chelsea \u201cstiffens and stares at me,\u201d according to Aitkenhead. The journalist then adds that many women of Hillary\u2019s generation are uncomfortable with biological males sharing women\u2019s bathrooms. \u201cI would say that, absolutely,\u201d Hillary nods firmly. \u201cAbsolutely. Yes.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Chelsea begins shooting a \u201cfurious stare\u201d at Aitkenhead, who points it out to her. \u201cI\u2019m a terrible actor,\u201d Chelsea laughs.\n\nChelsea also expressed delight at the National Health Service\u2019s new policy of assigning single-sex wards according to gender identity rather than biology:\n\n\u201cHow can you treat someone if you don\u2019t recognize who they feel and know in their core they are?\u201d\n\nAnd she Amen\u2019d the entrance of men into women\u2019s athletics:\n\n\u201cAnd I strongly support children being able to play on the sports teams that match their own gender identity. I think we need to be doing everything we can to support kids in being whoever they know themselves to be and discovering who they are.\u201d\n\nIn the world of wokeness, Hillary\u2019s no slouch herself \u2014 she recently explained her decision to stay with Bill amid his exposed romps with Monica Lewinsky thusly:\n\n\u201cSometimes, when your child has an issue \u2014 I had a friend a few years ago who called up and said \u2018I don\u2019t know who to talk to about this, but my little girl wants to be a boy. What do I do?\u2019 And, you know, several of us kind of \u2014 we didn\u2019t know what to do, we never had a friend who\u2019d faced that before. Several of us kind of read everything and talked to people and gave her advice and it was really gutsy for her to say, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m going to respect the feelings of my child, as hard as it is for me to understand this.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut she seemed to slip with The Sunday Times, and I\u2019d expect there to be a backlash to her response:\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve got to be sensitive to how difficult this is. There are women who\u2019d say [to a man identifying as a woman], \u2018You know what, you\u2019ve never had the kind of life experiences that I\u2019ve had. So I respect who you are, but don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re the same as me.\u2019 I hear that conversation all the time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s dicey territory, but maybe she\u2019s actually right \u2014 she does believe in being \u201cgutsy.\u201d\n\n-ALEX\n\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\n\nTucker Carlson Lambasts Demagoguing Democrats & Hits On What Men Are Missing; This Is What The World Needs \u2013 Now\n\nOne Of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Alleged Victims Takes Down Hillary Clinton Hard: \u2018I Can\u2019t Believe I Used To Support Her\u2019\n\nIn Order To Ensure \u2018The Safety Of Everyone,\u2019 A 12-Year-Old Is Arrested And Charged With A Felony.
