We were knocking him on his back, telling him, \u2018It\u2019s okay. You got hit by lightning.'\u201d\n\nThe dogs ran away after the lightning strike, but authorities eventually recovered them in a nearby wooded area.\n\nThe lightning strike also left a gaping hole in the concrete at the spot where it struck the man.\n\nFirst responders arrived at the scene and rushed Coreas to a local hospital, according to a GoFundMe page set up by his friends and family.\n\n\u201cHe sustained very serious injuries but by the grace of God he is alive. It is a miracle and a blessing that He is alive,\u201d his family wrote on the page.\n\nCoreas suffered from multiple fractured ribs, a fractured temporal bone (behind his left ear), a swollen eye, bruising, and damage to his muscles due to the lightning strike.\n\nThe GoFundMe page raising money for Coreas\u2019s recovery has raised more than $12,000 as of Saturday afternoon.", "description": "A man walking his dogs outside in Texas instantly collapsed after a lightning bolt instantly hit him, according to a video of the incident.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/lightning-bolt-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
