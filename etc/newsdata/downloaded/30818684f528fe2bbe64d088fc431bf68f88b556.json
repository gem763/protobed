That\u2019s the pre-tournament objective seized. Yet Leitch is far from satisfied.\n\nThe Japanese may not ever have played a knockout game, but they hadn\u2019t won a group game for 20 years at the Rugby World Cup before winning three in 2015 - including the shocking 34-32 win over South Africa that was dubbed the Miracle of Brighton.\n\nNeither Japan nor South Africa has really focused on that result this week. The Japanese because head coach Jamie Joseph doesn\u2019t think this team will be defined by that tournament. And the Springboks because \u2026 well, it\u2019s better forgotten by the two-time World Cup champions.\n\nSouth Africa beat Japan 41-7 in a warmup game here last month, but neither squad is putting too much emphasis on that, either.\n\n\u201cBoth teams had different things in mind. We definitely played a style of game that wasn\u2019t around playing for South Africa, it was around playing for the World Cup,\u201d Japan\u2019s attack coach Tony Brown said Saturday. \u201cTomorrow is a completely different game, a one-off quarterfinal, winner goes on and loser bows out so it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nJoseph and Brown have played for New Zealand. Joseph played against Japan in 1995 and for Japan at the \u201899 World Cup. Their collection of home-grown talent and naturalized players from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have really embraced the Japanese culture and, with that, have become the nation\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing the amount of people that have got on the Japan bandwagon,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe amount of people watching every game and supporting us in Japan has been amazing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same in New Zealand. Japan is New Zealand\u2019s second (favorite) team now, so we\u2019re proud we can represent them playing good footy.\u201d\n\nEntertaining rugby has been Japan\u2019s signature in this tournament, with the ball regularly spread wide to the speedy wings. That could change on Sunday, when South Africa aims to outmuscle them and slow them down. That strategy was obvious when Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus announced a squad - 24 hours before deadline - featuring six forwards on the eight-man reserves bench.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a double bluff. I think there\u2019s only one thing they\u2019re going to do and that\u2019s come and physically intimidate us,\u201d Brown said. \u201cA messy game is what they\u2019re good at. Our challenge is to play our game and try to entice them into playing some Japanese rugby.\u201d\n\nAs well as Leitch, the Japan squad for Sunday contains seven other players involved in that massive upset four years ago. Winger Kotaro Matsushima is the joint-leading try-scorer this tournament so far, and hooker Shota Horie and lock Luke Thompson both also started the game in \u201815. Prop Keita Inagaki and flyhalf Yu Tamura were on the bench four years ago, but are in the starting XV this time.\n\nTamura was the leading scorer with 48 points in the group stage, and his combination with scrumhalf Yutaka Nagare has been instrumental in providing the connection between Japan\u2019s high-energy forwards and speedy backs.\n\nNagare, a crafty scrumhalf on the smaller side, knows he can expect a lot of attention from the big Boks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come at us head-on - make it a forward battle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to fight properly there of course, but it\u2019s important to play the ball smartly and make it a quick battle.\n\n\u201cIt will be real hand-to-hand combat and tough, but I\u2019ll keep giving energy to the team.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese will have almost unanimous crowd support. As well as the almost 50,000 at Tokyo Stadium, the domestic broadcast audience is expected to exceed 50 million again and bars and official fan zones around the country will be packed with supporters wearing red-and-white hooped jerseys and headscarves with hissho, or must win, printed on the front.\n\n\u201cWe really feel the attention and at the ground the fans push us on, too,\u201d Nagare said. \u201cI think we have made a good impact, not just in the rugby world, but in the entire sporting world.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll carry the emotions of our fans but it\u2019s something we should feel after executing our game.\u201d\n\nFlanker Pieter Labuschagne has experience of both sides in this contest, having played in South Africa before moving to Japan seeking opportunities. He stood in as Japan captain for a couple of games during the group stage, and has been an important addition to the hard-working backrow.\n\n\u201cWe come from a lot of different backgrounds, but we have all come together as one team, all working toward the same goal,\u201d Labuschagne said of the Japan team. \u201cI really love South Africa but I also love Japan and everyone here. This is our team. This has become our new home. We want to make everyone in Japan proud, everyone in this camp, this group.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not planning to stop here, so it\u2019s about doing what we did in the pool, keep on playing for each other and being one team.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Before each match, Michael Leitch and his Japan squad have left the field in a battle-like formation after their warmup, each man in widening ranks behind the captain and with his right hand gripping the shoulder of the teammate in front.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Pye"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/aptopix_japan_rugby_wcup_japan_scotland_52144_c0-125-3000-1875_s1200x700.jpg?5df86175492ddcdc04d9d2b6261257b2d49617ee", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
