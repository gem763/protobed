They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico investigation found.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation.\n\nThe Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort\u2019s resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump\u2019s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine\u2019s foe to the east, Russia. But they were far less concerted or centrally directed than Russia\u2019s alleged hacking and dissemination of Democratic emails.\n\nRussia\u2019s effort was personally directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, involved the country\u2019s military and foreign intelligence services, according to U.S. intelligence officials. They reportedly briefed Trump last week on the possibility that Russian operatives might have compromising information on the president-elect. And at a Senate hearing last week on the hacking, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said \u201cI don't think we've ever encountered a more aggressive or direct campaign to interfere in our election process than we've seen in this case.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little evidence of such a top-down effort by Ukraine. Longtime observers suggest that the rampant corruption, factionalism and economic struggles plaguing the country \u2014 not to mention its ongoing strife with Russia \u2014 would render it unable to pull off an ambitious covert interference campaign in another country\u2019s election. And President Petro Poroshenko\u2019s administration, along with the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, insists that Ukraine stayed neutral in the race.\n\nYet Politico\u2019s investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another\u2019s elections.\n\nRussia\u2019s meddling has sparked outrage from the American body politic. The U.S. intelligence community undertook the rare move of publicizing its findings on the matter, and President Barack Obama took several steps to officially retaliate, while members of Congress continue pushing for more investigations into the hacking and a harder line against Russia, which was already viewed in Washington as America\u2019s leading foreign adversary.\n\nUkraine, on the other hand, has traditionally enjoyed strong relations with U.S. administrations. Its officials worry that could change under Trump, whose team has privately expressed sentiments ranging from ambivalence to deep skepticism about Poroshenko\u2019s regime, while sounding unusually friendly notes about Putin\u2019s regime.\n\nPoroshenko is scrambling to alter that dynamic, recently signing a $50,000-a-month contract with a well-connected GOP-linked Washington lobbying firm to set up meetings with U.S. government officials \u201cto strengthen U.S.-Ukrainian relations.\u201d\n\nA Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort (pictured) and Russia, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation. | Getty\n\nRevelations about Ukraine\u2019s anti-Trump efforts could further set back those efforts.\n\n\u201cThings seem to be going from bad to worse for Ukraine,\u201d said David A. Merkel, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who helped oversee U.S. relations with Russia and Ukraine while working in George W. Bush\u2019s State Department and National Security Council.\n\nMerkel, who has served as an election observer in Ukrainian presidential elections dating back to 1993, noted there\u2019s some irony in Ukraine and Russia taking opposite sides in the 2016 presidential race, given that past Ukrainian elections were widely viewed in Washington\u2019s foreign policy community as proxy wars between the U.S. and Russia.\n\n\u201cNow, it seems that a U.S. election may have been seen as a surrogate battle by those in Kiev and Moscow,\u201d Merkel said.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThe Ukrainian antipathy for Trump\u2019s team \u2014 and alignment with Clinton\u2019s \u2014 can be traced back to late 2013. That\u2019s when the country\u2019s president, Viktor Yanukovych, whom Manafort had been advising, abruptly backed out of a European Union pact linked to anti-corruption reforms. Instead, Yanukovych entered into a multibillion-dollar bailout agreement with Russia, sparking protests across Ukraine and prompting Yanukovych to flee the country to Russia under Putin\u2019s protection.\n\nIn the ensuing crisis, Russian troops moved into the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and Manafort dropped off the radar.\n\nManafort\u2019s work for Yanukovych caught the attention of a veteran Democratic operative named Alexandra Chalupa, who had worked in the White House Office of Public Liaison during the Clinton administration. Chalupa went on to work as a staffer, then as a consultant, for Democratic National Committee. The DNC paid her $412,000 from 2004 to June 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records, though she also was paid by other clients during that time, including Democratic campaigns and the DNC\u2019s arm for engaging expatriate Democrats around the world.\n\nA daughter of Ukrainian immigrants who maintains strong ties to the Ukrainian-American diaspora and the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, Chalupa, a lawyer by training, in 2014 was doing pro bono work for another client interested in the Ukrainian crisis and began researching Manafort\u2019s role in Yanukovych\u2019s rise, as well as his ties to the pro-Russian oligarchs who funded Yanukovych\u2019s political party.\n\nIn an interview this month, Chalupa told Politico she had developed a network of sources in Kiev and Washington, including investigative journalists, government officials and private intelligence operatives. While her consulting work at the DNC this past election cycle centered on mobilizing ethnic communities \u2014 including Ukrainian-Americans \u2014 she said that, when Trump\u2019s unlikely presidential campaign began surging in late 2015, she began focusing more on the research, and expanded it to include Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, as well.\n\nShe occasionally shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Clinton\u2019s campaign, Chalupa said. In January 2016 \u2014 months before Manafort had taken any role in Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 Chalupa told a senior DNC official that, when it came to Trump\u2019s campaign, \u201cI felt there was a Russia connection,\u201d Chalupa recalled. \u201cAnd that, if there was, that we can expect Paul Manafort to be involved in this election,\u201d said Chalupa, who at the time also was warning leaders in the Ukrainian-American community that Manafort was \u201cPutin\u2019s political brain for manipulating U.S. foreign policy and elections.\u201d\n\nShe said she shared her concern with Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Valeriy Chaly, and one of his top aides, Oksana Shulyar, during a March 2016 meeting at the Ukrainian Embassy. According to someone briefed on the meeting, Chaly said that Manafort was very much on his radar, but that he wasn\u2019t particularly concerned about the operative\u2019s ties to Trump since he didn\u2019t believe Trump stood much of a chance of winning the GOP nomination, let alone the presidency.\n\nThat was not an uncommon view at the time, and, perhaps as a result, Trump\u2019s ties to Russia \u2014 let alone Manafort\u2019s \u2014 were not the subject of much attention.\n\nThat all started to change just four days after Chalupa\u2019s meeting at the embassy, when it was reported that Trump had in fact hired Manafort, suggesting that Chalupa may have been on to something. She quickly found herself in high demand. The day after Manafort\u2019s hiring was revealed, she briefed the DNC\u2019s communications staff on Manafort, Trump and their ties to Russia, according to an operative familiar with the situation.\n\nA former DNC staffer described the exchange as an \u201cinformal conversation,\u201d saying \u201c\u2018briefing\u2019 makes it sound way too formal,\u201d and adding, \u201cWe were not directing or driving her work on this.\u201d Yet, the former DNC staffer and the operative familiar with the situation agreed that with the DNC\u2019s encouragement, Chalupa asked embassy staff to try to arrange an interview in which Poroshenko might discuss Manafort\u2019s ties to Yanukovych.\n\nWhile the embassy declined that request, officials there became \u201chelpful\u201d in Chalupa\u2019s efforts, she said, explaining that she traded information and leads with them. \u201cIf I asked a question, they would provide guidance, or if there was someone I needed to follow up with.\u201d But she stressed, \u201cThere were no documents given, nothing like that.\u201d\n\nChalupa said the embassy also worked directly with reporters researching Trump, Manafort and Russia to point them in the right directions. She added, though, \u201cthey were being very protective and not speaking to the press as much as they should have. I think they were being careful because their situation was that they had to be very, very careful because they could not pick sides. It\u2019s a political issue, and they didn\u2019t want to get involved politically because they couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShulyar vehemently denied working with reporters or with Chalupa on anything related to Trump or Manafort, explaining \u201cwe were stormed by many reporters to comment on this subject, but our clear and adamant position was not to give any comment [and] not to interfere into the campaign affairs.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s effort to influence the 2016 race was personally directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured), and involved the country\u2019s military and foreign intelligence services, according to U.S. intelligence officials. | Getty\n\nBoth Shulyar and Chalupa said the purpose of their initial meeting was to organize a June reception at the embassy to promote Ukraine. According to the embassy\u2019s website, the event highlighted female Ukrainian leaders, featuring speeches by Ukrainian parliamentarian Hanna Hopko, who discussed \u201cUkraine\u2019s fight against the Russian aggression in Donbas,\u201d and longtime Hillary Clinton confidante Melanne Verveer, who worked for Clinton in the State Department and was a vocal surrogate during the presidential campaign.\n\nShulyar said her work with Chalupa \u201cdidn\u2019t involve the campaign,\u201d and she specifically stressed that \u201cWe have never worked to research and disseminate damaging information about Donald Trump and Paul Manafort.\u201d\n\nBut Andrii Telizhenko, who worked as a political officer in the Ukrainian Embassy under Shulyar, said she instructed him to help Chalupa research connections between Trump, Manafort and Russia. \u201cOksana said that if I had any information, or knew other people who did, then I should contact Chalupa,\u201d recalled Telizhenko, who is now a political consultant in Kiev. \u201cThey were coordinating an investigation with the Hillary team on Paul Manafort with Alexandra Chalupa,\u201d he said, adding \u201cOksana was keeping it all quiet,\u201d but \u201cthe embassy worked very closely with\u201d Chalupa.\n\nIn fact, sources familiar with the effort say that Shulyar specifically called Telizhenko into a meeting with Chalupa to provide an update on an American media outlet\u2019s ongoing investigation into Manafort.\n\nTelizhenko recalled that Chalupa told him and Shulyar that, \u201cIf we can get enough information on Paul [Manafort] or Trump\u2019s involvement with Russia, she can get a hearing in Congress by September.\u201d\n\nChalupa confirmed that, a week after Manafort\u2019s hiring was announced, she discussed the possibility of a congressional investigation with a foreign policy legislative assistant in the office of Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), who co-chairs the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus. But, Chalupa said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d\n\nAsked about the effort, the Kaptur legislative assistant called it a \u201ctouchy subject\u201d in an internal email to colleagues that was accidentally forwarded to Politico.\n\nKaptur\u2019s office later emailed an official statement explaining that the lawmaker is backing a bill to create an independent commission to investigate \u201cpossible outside interference in our elections.\u201d The office added \u201cat this time, the evidence related to this matter points to Russia, but Congresswoman Kaptur is concerned with any evidence of foreign entities interfering in our elections.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nAlmost as quickly as Chalupa\u2019s efforts attracted the attention of the Ukrainian Embassy and Democrats, she also found herself the subject of some unwanted attention from overseas.\n\nWithin a few weeks of her initial meeting at the embassy with Shulyar and Chaly, Chalupa on April 20 received the first of what became a series of messages from the administrators of her private Yahoo email account, warning her that \u201cstate-sponsored actors\u201d were trying to hack into her emails.\n\nShe kept up her crusade, appearing on a panel a week after the initial hacking message to discuss her research on Manafort with a group of Ukrainian investigative journalists gathered at the Library of Congress for a program sponsored by a U.S. congressional agency called the Open World Leadership Center.\n\nCenter spokeswoman Maura Shelden stressed that her group is nonpartisan and ensures \u201cthat our delegations hear from both sides of the aisle, receiving bipartisan information.\u201d She said the Ukrainian journalists in subsequent days met with Republican officials in North Carolina and elsewhere. And she said that, before the Library of Congress event, \u201cOpen World\u2019s program manager for Ukraine did contact Chalupa to advise her that Open World is a nonpartisan agency of the Congress.\u201d\n\nChalupa, though, indicated in an email that was later hacked and released by WikiLeaks that the Open World Leadership Center \u201cput me on the program to speak specifically about Paul Manafort.\u201d\n\nIn the email, which was sent in early May to then-DNC communications director Luis Miranda, Chalupa noted that she had extended an invitation to the Library of Congress forum to veteran Washington investigative reporter Michael Isikoff. Two days before the event, he had published a story for Yahoo News revealing the unraveling of a $26 million deal between Manafort and a Russian oligarch related to a telecommunications venture in Ukraine. And Chalupa wrote in the email she\u2019d been \u201cworking with for the past few weeks\u201d with Isikoff \u201cand connected him to the Ukrainians\u201d at the event.\n\nIsikoff, who accompanied Chalupa to a reception at the Ukrainian Embassy immediately after the Library of Congress event, declined to comment.\n\nChalupa further indicated in her hacked May email to the DNC that she had additional sensitive information about Manafort that she intended to share \u201coffline\u201d with Miranda and DNC research director Lauren Dillon, including \u201ca big Trump component you and Lauren need to be aware of that will hit in next few weeks and something I\u2019m working on you should be aware of.\u201d Explaining that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing the intel over email, Chalupa attached a screenshot of a warning from Yahoo administrators about \u201cstate-sponsored\u201d hacking on her account, explaining, \u201cSince I started digging into Manafort these messages have been a daily occurrence on my yahoo account despite changing my password often.\u201d\n\nDillon and Miranda declined to comment.\n\nA DNC official stressed that Chalupa was a consultant paid to do outreach for the party\u2019s political department, not a researcher. She undertook her investigations into Trump, Manafort and Russia on her own, and the party did not incorporate her findings in its dossiers on the subjects, the official said, stressing that the DNC had been building robust research books on Trump and his ties to Russia long before Chalupa began sounding alarms.\n\nNonetheless, Chalupa\u2019s hacked email reportedly escalated concerns among top party officials, hardening their conclusion that Russia likely was behind the cyber intrusions with which the party was only then beginning to grapple.\n\nChalupa left the DNC after the Democratic convention in late July to focus fulltime on her research into Manafort, Trump and Russia. She said she provided off-the-record information and guidance to \u201ca lot of journalists\u201d working on stories related to Manafort and Trump\u2019s Russia connections, despite what she described as escalating harassment.\n\nAbout a month-and-a-half after Chalupa first started receiving hacking alerts, someone broke into her car outside the Northwest Washington home where she lives with her husband and three young daughters, she said. They \u201crampaged it, basically, but didn\u2019t take anything valuable \u2014 left money, sunglasses, $1,200 worth of golf clubs,\u201d she said, explaining she didn\u2019t file a police report after that incident because she didn\u2019t connect it to her research and the hacking.\n\nBut by the time a similar vehicle break-in occurred involving two family cars, she was convinced that it was a Russia-linked intimidation campaign. The police report on the latter break-in noted that \u201cboth vehicles were unlocked by an unknown person and the interior was ransacked, with papers and the garage openers scattered throughout the cars. Nothing was taken from the vehicles.\u201d\n\nThen, early in the morning on another day, a woman \u201cwearing white flowers in her hair\u201d tried to break into her family\u2019s home at 1:30 a.m., Chalupa said. Shulyar told Chalupa that the mysterious incident bore some of the hallmarks of intimidation campaigns used against foreigners in Russia, according to Chalupa.\n\n\u201cThis is something that they do to U.S. diplomats, they do it to Ukrainians. Like, this is how they operate. They break into people\u2019s homes. They harass people. They\u2019re theatrical about it,\u201d Chalupa said. \u201cThey must have seen when I was writing to the DNC staff, outlining who Manafort was, pulling articles, saying why it was significant, and painting the bigger picture.\u201d\n\nIn a Yahoo News story naming Chalupa as one of 16 \u201cordinary people\u201d who \u201cshaped the 2016 election,\u201d Isikoff wrote that after Chalupa left the DNC, FBI agents investigating the hacking questioned her and examined her laptop and smartphone.\n\nChalupa this month told Politico that, as her research and role in the election started becoming more public, she began receiving death threats, along with continued alerts of state-sponsored hacking. But she said, \u201cNone of this has scared me off.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nWhile it\u2019s not uncommon for outside operatives to serve as intermediaries between governments and reporters, one of the more damaging Russia-related stories for the Trump campaign \u2014 and certainly for Manafort \u2014 can be traced more directly to the Ukrainian government.\n\nDocuments released by an independent Ukrainian government agency \u2014 and publicized by a parliamentarian \u2014 appeared to show $12.7 million in cash payments that were earmarked for Manafort by the Russia-aligned party of the deposed former president, Yanukovych.\n\nThe New York Times, in the August story revealing the ledgers\u2019 existence, reported that the payments earmarked for Manafort were \u201ca focus\u201d of an investigation by Ukrainian anti-corruption officials, while CNN reported days later that the FBI was pursuing an overlapping inquiry.\n\nOne of the most damaging Russia-related stories during Donald Trump's campaign can be traced to the Ukrainian government. | AP Photo\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign seized on the story to advance Democrats\u2019 argument that Trump\u2019s campaign was closely linked to Russia. The ledger represented \u201cmore troubling connections between Donald Trump\u2019s team and pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine,\u201d Robby Mook, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement. He demanded that Trump \u201cdisclose campaign chair Paul Manafort\u2019s and all other campaign employees\u2019 and advisers\u2019 ties to Russian or pro-Kremlin entities, including whether any of Trump\u2019s employees or advisers are currently representing and or being paid by them.\u201d\n\nA former Ukrainian investigative journalist and current parliamentarian named Serhiy Leshchenko, who was elected in 2014 as part of Poroshenko\u2019s party, held a news conference to highlight the ledgers, and to urge Ukrainian and American law enforcement to aggressively investigate Manafort.\n\n\u201cI believe and understand the basis of these payments are totally against the law \u2014 we have the proof from these books,\u201d Leshchenko said during the news conference, which attracted international media coverage. \u201cIf Mr. Manafort denies any allegations, I think he has to be interrogated into this case and prove his position that he was not involved in any misconduct on the territory of Ukraine,\u201d Leshchenko added.\n\nManafort denied receiving any off-books cash from Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions, and said that he had never been contacted about the ledger by Ukrainian or American investigators, later telling POLITICO \u201cI was just caught in the crossfire.\u201d\n\nAccording to a series of memos reportedly compiled for Trump\u2019s opponents by a former British intelligence agent, Yanukovych, in a secret meeting with Putin on the day after the Times published its report, admitted that he had authorized \u201csubstantial kickback payments to Manafort.\u201d But according to the report, which was published Tuesday by BuzzFeed but remains unverified. Yanukovych assured Putin \u201cthat there was no documentary trail left behind which could provide clear evidence of this\u201d \u2014 an alleged statement that seemed to implicitly question the authenticity of the ledger.\n\nThe scrutiny around the ledgers \u2014 combined with that from other stories about his Ukraine work \u2014 proved too much, and he stepped down from the Trump campaign less than a week after the Times story.\n\nAt the time, Leshchenko suggested that his motivation was partly to undermine Trump. \u201cFor me, it was important to show not only the corruption aspect, but that he is [a] pro-Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world,\u201d Leshchenko told the Financial Times about two weeks after his news conference. The newspaper noted that Trump\u2019s candidacy had spurred \u201cKiev\u2019s wider political leadership to do something they would never have attempted before: intervene, however indirectly, in a U.S. election,\u201d and the story quoted Leshchenko asserting that the majority of Ukraine\u2019s politicians are \u201con Hillary Clinton\u2019s side.\u201d\n\nBut by this month, Leshchenko was seeking to recast his motivation, telling Politico, \u201cI didn\u2019t care who won the U.S. elections. This was a decision for the American voters to decide.\u201d His goal in highlighting the ledgers, he said was \u201cto raise these issues on a political level and emphasize the importance of the investigation.\u201d\n\nIn a series of answers provided to Politico, a spokesman for Poroshenko distanced his administration from both Leshchenko\u2019s efforts and those of the agency that reLeshchenko Leshchenko leased the ledgers, The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine. It was created in 2014 as a condition for Ukraine to receive aid from the U.S. and the European Union, and it signed an evidence-sharing agreement with the FBI in late June \u2014 less than a month and a half before it released the ledgers.\n\nThe bureau is \u201cfully independent,\u201d the Poroshenko spokesman said, adding that when it came to the presidential administration there was \u201cno targeted action against Manafort.\u201d He added \u201cas to Serhiy Leshchenko, he positions himself as a representative of internal opposition in the Bloc of Petro Poroshenko\u2019s faction, despite [the fact that] he belongs to the faction,\u201d the spokesman said, adding, \u201cit was about him personally who pushed [the anti-corruption bureau] to proceed with investigation on Manafort.\u201d\n\nBut an operative who has worked extensively in Ukraine, including as an adviser to Poroshenko, said it was highly unlikely that either Leshchenko or the anti-corruption bureau would have pushed the issue without at least tacit approval from Poroshenko or his closest allies.\n\n\u201cIt was something that Poroshenko was probably aware of and could have stopped if he wanted to,\u201d said the operative.\n\nAnd, almost immediately after Trump\u2019s stunning victory over Clinton, questions began mounting about the investigations into the ledgers \u2014 and the ledgers themselves.\n\nAn official with the anti-corruption bureau told a Ukrainian newspaper, \u201cMr. Manafort does not have a role in this case.\u201d\n\nUkrainian member of parliament Serhiy Leshchenko has sought to recast his investigation after the election. | Getty\n\nAnd, while the anti-corruption bureau told Politico late last month that a \u201cgeneral investigation [is] still ongoing\u201d of the ledger, it said Manafort is not a target of the investigation. \u201cAs he is not the Ukrainian citizen, [the anti-corruption bureau] by the law couldn\u2019t investigate him personally,\u201d the bureau said in a statement.\n\nSome Poroshenko critics have gone further, suggesting that the bureau is backing away from investigating because the ledgers might have been doctored or even forged.\n\nValentyn Nalyvaichenko, a Ukrainian former diplomat who served as the country\u2019s head of security under Poroshenko but is now affiliated with a leading opponent of Poroshenko, said it was fishy that \u201conly one part of the black ledger appeared.\u201d He asked, \u201cWhere is the handwriting analysis?\u201d and said it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to announce an investigation based on the ledgers. He met last month in Washington with Trump allies, and said, \u201cof course they all recognize that our [anti-corruption bureau] intervened in the presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nAnd in an interview this week, Manafort, who re-emerged as an informal advisor to Trump after Election Day, suggested that the ledgers were inauthentic and called their publication \u201ca politically motivated false attack on me. My role as a paid consultant was public. There was nothing off the books, but the way that this was presented tried to make it look shady.\u201d\n\nHe added that he felt particularly wronged by efforts to cast his work in Ukraine as pro-Russian, arguing \u201call my efforts were focused on helping Ukraine move into Europe and the West.\u201d He specifically cited his work on denuclearizing the country and on the European Union trade and political pact that Yanukovych spurned before fleeing to Russia. \u201cIn no case was I ever involved in anything that would be contrary to U.S. interests,\u201d Manafort said.\n\nYet Russia seemed to come to the defense of Manafort and Trump last month, when a spokeswoman for Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry charged that the Ukrainian government used the ledgers as a political weapon.\n\n\u201cUkraine seriously complicated the work of Trump\u2019s election campaign headquarters by planting information according to which Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, allegedly accepted money from Ukrainian oligarchs,\u201d Maria Zakharova said at a news briefing, according to a transcript of her remarks posted on the Foreign Ministry\u2019s website. \u201cAll of you have heard this remarkable story,\u201d she told assembled reporters.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nBeyond any efforts to sabotage Trump, Ukrainian officials didn\u2019t exactly extend a hand of friendship to the GOP nominee during the campaign.\n\nThe ambassador, Chaly, penned an op-ed for The Hill, in which he chastised Trump for a confusing series of statements in which the GOP candidate at one point expressed a willingness to consider recognizing Russia\u2019s annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea as legitimate. The op-ed made some in the embassy uneasy, sources said.\n\n\u201cThat was like too close for comfort, even for them,\u201d said Chalupa. \u201cThat was something that was as risky as they were going to be.\u201d\n\nFormer Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk warned on Facebook that Trump had \u201cchallenged the very values of the free world.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s minister of internal affairs, Arsen Avakov, piled on, trashing Trump on Twitter in July as a \u201cclown\u201d and asserting that Trump is \u201can even bigger danger to the US than terrorism.\u201d\n\nAvakov, in a Facebook post, lashed out at Trump for his confusing Crimea comments, calling the assessment the \u201cdiagnosis of a dangerous misfit,\u201d according to a translated screenshot featured in one media report, though he later deleted the post. He called Trump \u201cdangerous for Ukraine and the US\u201d and noted that Manafort worked with Yanukovych when the former Ukrainian leader \u201cfled to Russia through Crimea. Where would Manafort lead Trump?\u201d\n\nThe Trump-Ukraine relationship grew even more fraught in September with reports that the GOP nominee had snubbed Poroshenko on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where the Ukrainian president tried to meet both major party candidates, but scored only a meeting with Clinton.\n\nTelizhenko, the former embassy staffer, said that, during the primaries, Chaly, the country\u2019s ambassador in Washington, had actually instructed the embassy not to reach out to Trump\u2019s campaign, even as it was engaging with those of Clinton and Trump\u2019s leading GOP rival, Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cWe had an order not to talk to the Trump team, because he was critical of Ukraine and the government and his critical position on Crimea and the conflict,\u201d said Telizhenko. \u201cI was yelled at when I proposed to talk to Trump,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe ambassador said not to get involved \u2014 Hillary is going to win.\u201d\n\nThis account was confirmed by Nalyvaichenko, the former diplomat and security chief now affiliated with a Poroshenko opponent, who said, \u201cThe Ukrainian authorities closed all doors and windows \u2014 this is from the Ukrainian side.\u201d He called the strategy \u201cbad and short-sighted.\u201d\n\nAndriy Artemenko, a Ukrainian parliamentarian associated with a conservative opposition party, did meet with Trump\u2019s team during the campaign and said he personally offered to set up similar meetings for Chaly but was rebuffed.\n\n\u201cIt was clear that they were supporting Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy,\u201d Artemenko said. \u201cThey did everything from organizing meetings with the Clinton team, to publicly supporting her, to criticizing Trump. \u2026 I think that they simply didn\u2019t meet because they thought that Hillary would win.\u201d\n\nShulyar rejected the characterizations that the embassy had a ban on interacting with Trump, instead explaining that it \u201chad different diplomats assigned for dealing with different teams tailoring the content and messaging. So it was not an instruction to abstain from the engagement but rather an internal discipline for diplomats not to get involved into a field she or he was not assigned to, but where another colleague was involved.\u201d\n\nAnd she pointed out that Chaly traveled to the GOP convention in Cleveland in late July and met with members of Trump\u2019s foreign policy team \u201cto highlight the importance of Ukraine and the support of it by the U.S.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. Valeriy Chaly publically critcized Donald Trump during the 2016 elections. | Getty\n\nDespite the outreach, Trump\u2019s campaign in Cleveland gutted a proposed amendment to the Republican Party platform that called for the U.S. to provide \u201clethal defensive weapons\u201d for Ukraine to defend itself against Russian incursion, backers of the measure charged.\n\nThe outreach ramped up after Trump\u2019s victory. Shulyar pointed out that Poroshenko was among the first foreign leaders to call to congratulate Trump. And she said that, since Election Day, Chaly has met with close Trump allies, including Sens. Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, and Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, while the ambassador accompanied Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, Ukraine\u2019s vice prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, to a round of Washington meetings with Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.), an early Trump backer, and Jim DeMint, president of The Heritage Foundation, which played a prominent role in Trump\u2019s transition.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nMany Ukrainian officials and operatives and their American allies see Trump\u2019s inauguration this month as an existential threat to the country, made worse, they admit, by the dissemination of the secret ledger, the antagonistic social media posts and the perception that the embassy meddled against \u2014 or at least shut out \u2014 Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really bad. The [Poroshenko] administration right now is trying to re-coordinate communications,\u201d said Telizhenko, adding, \u201cThe Trump organization doesn\u2019t want to talk to our administration at all.\u201d\n\nDuring Nalyvaichenko\u2019s trip to Washington last month, he detected lingering ill will toward Ukraine from some, and lack of interest from others, he recalled. \u201cUkraine is not on the top of the list, not even the middle,\u201d he said.\n\nPoroshenko\u2019s allies are scrambling to figure out how to build a relationship with Trump, who is known for harboring and prosecuting grudges for years.\n\nA delegation of Ukrainian parliamentarians allied with Poroshenko last month traveled to Washington partly to try to make inroads with the Trump transition team, but they were unable to secure a meeting, according to a Washington foreign policy operative familiar with the trip. And operatives in Washington and Kiev say that after the election, Poroshenko met in Kiev with top executives from the Washington lobbying firm BGR \u2014 including Ed Rogers and Lester Munson \u2014 about how to navigate the Trump regime.\n\nWeeks later, BGR reported to the Department of Justice that the government of Ukraine would pay the firm $50,000 a month to \u201cprovide strategic public relations and government affairs counsel,\u201d including \u201coutreach to U.S. government officials, non-government organizations, members of the media and other individuals.\u201d\n\nFirm spokesman Jeffrey Birnbaum suggested that \u201cpro-Putin oligarchs\u201d were already trying to sow doubts about BGR\u2019s work with Poroshenko. While the firm maintains close relationships with GOP congressional leaders, several of its principals were dismissive or sharply critical of Trump during the GOP primary, which could limit their effectiveness lobbying the new administration.\n\nThe Poroshenko regime\u2019s standing with Trump is considered so dire that the president\u2019s allies after the election actually reached out to make amends with \u2014 and even seek assistance from \u2014 Manafort, according to two operatives familiar with Ukraine\u2019s efforts to make inroads with Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Poroshenko\u2019s rivals are seeking to capitalize on his dicey relationship with Trump\u2019s team. Some are pressuring him to replace Chaly, a close ally of Poroshenko\u2019s who is being blamed by critics in Kiev and Washington for implementing \u2014 if not engineering \u2014 the country\u2019s anti-Trump efforts, according to Ukrainian and U.S. politicians and operatives interviewed for this story. They say that several potential Poroshenko opponents have been through Washington since the election seeking audiences of their own with Trump allies, though most have failed to do do so.\n\n\u201cNone of the Ukrainians have any access to Trump \u2014 they are all desperate to get it, and are willing to pay big for it,\u201d said one American consultant whose company recently met in Washington with Yuriy Boyko, a former vice prime minister under Yanukovych. Boyko, who like Yanukovych has a pro-Russian worldview, is considering a presidential campaign of his own, and his representatives offered \u201cto pay a shit-ton of money\u201d to get access to Trump and his inaugural events, according to the consultant.\n\nThe consultant turned down the work, explaining, \u201cIt sounded shady, and we don\u2019t want to get in the middle of that kind of stuff.\u201d", "description": "Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton.", "authors": ["Austin Wright", "Martin Matishak", "Shane Goldmacher", "Michael Crowley", "Marc Caputo", "Kenneth P.
