But some media types like to say \u201ceven Fox\u201d has found such-and-such, as if it\u2019s a survey of the network\u2019s viewers rather than a widely respected professional polling operation.\n\nOne of those who is displeased, not surprisingly, is Trump.\n\n\u201cFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWhoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days.\u201d He went on to name some of his least favorite network figures--Andrew Napolitano, Shep Smith, Donna Brazile--but added: \u201cOh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s the thing, when you drill down on the poll: It reflects the same old partisan chasm that has defined Trump\u2019s tenure since the inauguration.\n\nEighty-five percent of Democrats support impeachment and removal; independents are split, in favor, 39 to 36 percent; and just 13 percent of Republicans back impeaching and expelling Trump from office.\n\nNow, it may be noteworthy that more than one in 10 Republicans want Trump gone. But if you\u2019re a Republican senator, and the country is almost evenly split on impeachment, and the vast majority of your party opposes it, you\u2019re not exactly under withering pressure to abandon your president.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nSome Democrats have wanted to impeach Trump forever. The survey showed support among Dems 9 points higher than those who believed the president asking Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate the Bidens is an impeachable offense.\n\nAnd overall in the Fox poll, the president\u2019s approval drifted down only a couple of points, to 43 percent.\n\nIn defying the House demands for testimony and documents as illegitimate and unconstitutional, the president is trying to change the conversation, to turn impeachment into a process story. If that drags on, with the inevitable court battles, many people may dismiss the whole mess as the usual Beltway bickering. Trump would obviously rather be talking about how the dreaded Democrats are treating him unfairly than whether it was improper for him to ask a foreign leader to help dig up dirt on one of his political rivals.\n\nBut Trump isn\u2019t the only one unhappy with his media coverage. Turns out the Biden campaign is really angry with the New York Times.\n\nIn a blistering letter to Executive Editor Dean Baquet, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager says the paper has played a key role in spreading a \u201cbaseless conspiracy theory\u201d about the former VP\u2014namely, the allegations about profiteering by Hunter Biden that are at the heart of the impeachment saga.\n\nThe letter, obtained by CNN, says the Times is actively participating in \u201ca smear campaign,\u201d that had previously been relegated to the likes of Breitbart and Russian propaganda. That is, until the Times\u2019 Ken Vogel reported on the allegations.\n\nHis May story, a straightforward account of Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, is headlined \u201cBiden Faces Conflict of Interest Questions that are Being Promoted By Trump and Allies.\u201d\n\nA Times statement said an op-ed by \u201cClinton Cash\u201d author Peter Schweizer, which fueled the Biden team\u2019s resentment, \u201cmakes an argument that nonpartisan government watchdogs would make, arguing in favor of a law that would prohibit self-dealing by those with government connections. Our coverage of the Biden campaign and Hunter Biden has been fair and accurate.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAre the Biden people seriously suggesting that a journalistic exploring of what the Bidens did, even if it involves no criminal wrongdoing, is out of bounds for the newspaper, as is a conservative op-ed?\n\nRather than having his staff fire off letters, Biden should sit down with reporters (from the Times or elsewhere) and make the case why he thinks the allegations are unfair.\n\nThe Fox poll, after all, contains a flashing red light. While 69 percent of those surveyed find Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine\u2019s leader extremely, very or somewhat troubling, 62 percent say the same about his allegations against Biden and his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China.", "description": "Is the impeachment battle starting to seriously scratch Donald Trump\u2019s Teflon?", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/10/694940094001_6093823032001_6093828259001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
