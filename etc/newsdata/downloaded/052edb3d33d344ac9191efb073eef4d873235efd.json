Little forest remained in this corner of the Amazon basin in Mato Grosso state. What was once a blanket of continuous green foliage is now a checkerboard of arid and dusty farmland.\n\nOne of the only things keeping the last shards of forest here from getting torched and bulldozed into cattle and soy farms is Abreu\u2019s team of firefighters: the Alliance Brigade. Known locally as the \u201cguerreiros de fogo\u201d \u2014 the \u201cfire warriors\u201d \u2014 they spread across hundreds of miles each day to contain blazes lit by land grabbers trying to burn, claim and develop the forest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey\u2019re burning in public parks. On private ranches. On government land. On Indian reservations. In so many places, and across such an immense sweep of forest, that stopping them all can seem impossible.\n\nBut perhaps here, in northeast Mato Grosso, the forest could still be defended. Where the brigade is active, the burn rate has plummeted. Some describe the team as a potential model for the rest of the Amazon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe challenge, however, in a land this remote, with few people and little infrastructure, is obvious \u2014 reaching the fire in time.\n\nAbreu drove hours down pockmarked dirt roads, past towns cloaked in red dirt, to discover an apocalyptic scene. Cows had died of smoke inhalation. An expanse of charred earth reached toward the horizon. The farmworkers had thrown nearly everything at the inferno, from water to heaps of dirt. Most of it had been defeated.\n\nAbreu had to finish the job.\n\nHe peered into a quiet patch of trees.\n\n\u201cDo you hear that?\u201d Abreu asked. \u201cFire.\u201d\n\nHe pulled on his cap. He unsheathed his long knife. Then he hacked into the foliage and disappeared into the trees, in search of the fight.\n\nAD\n\nA violent struggle for land fuels the fires\n\nMato Grosso means \u201cthick bush,\u201d and until recently the name fit. The last asphalt road ended long before this corner of the state. The only reasonable way in was by plane. And the humidity of the trees was a natural flame retardant: Fire dissolved at the forest\u2019s edge, like magic.\n\nAD\n\nThis was the land that John Carter, the former U.S. Army paratrooper who founded the Alliance Brigade a decade ago, came to know when he moved here from Texas in 1996.\n\n\u201cAn island in the forest,\u201d was how he described his ranch then. Now, looking out at the Araguaia State Park, he could see that it was the forest that had become the island.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis wind,\u201d he said, feeling it pick up. \u201cIt\u2019s going to burn today.\u201d\n\n\u201cUncontrollable,\u201d Abreu agreed.\n\nThey boarded Carter\u2019s aluminum boat and chugged out onto the River of the Dead. Carter, a compact man in a cowboy hat and boots, scanned the scorched coastline for plumes of smoke.\n\nWhen he first piloted his single-engine down here, he had no idea why there were so many fires. But he would learn.\n\nThere was big money in \u201cflipping\u201d the forest \u2014 burning it, then selling it as farmland \u2014 and squatters and speculators wanted in. A Brazilian law allowed the purchase of uninhabited public land here at deep discounts. Then agrarian reform efforts made private land a target for landless poor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe result was a violent struggle involving ranchers, indigenous peoples and squatters in which the best way for settlers to claim forest, no matter the owner, was to burn it.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d Carter said, pointing at rising smoke. \u201cThey\u2019re lighting it everywhere!\u201d\n\nThe boat sped toward the plume.\n\nFire so defines Carter\u2019s life that it\u2019s difficult to remember a time when it didn\u2019t. In 1999, squatters started burning a neighbor\u2019s forest. In 2008, they came for Carter\u2019s land, torching the 50 percent he had preserved \u2014 more than 10,000 acres.\n\nEnraged, and fearful of what he might do, he gave away nearly all of his guns. But the anger \u2014 that he couldn\u2019t dispose of.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even see the beauty anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI just see rage. Because we know what the future holds.\u201d\n\nTo Carter, the future: the entire Amazon transformed by an avalanche of development and deforestation. It was a scenario he once couldn\u2019t envision. But he has seen it happen in Mato Grosso, on his land, and now again on this river.\n\nAD\n\nAraguaia State Park, half the size of Rhode Island, doesn\u2019t have a single patrol officer. Squatters are exploiting the void by lighting fires to destroy the forest so there\u2019s no choice but to develop it.\n\nThree fires now flared along the river. Smoke filled the sky. The boat hit the shore.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if we can catch them,\u201d Carter said, charging into the forest.\n\nRanchers could be part of the solution\n\nKika Carter couldn\u2019t get her husband to calm down.\n\nAD\n\nThe smoke had grown so thick they couldn\u2019t see across the river. They could barely drive. Barely fly. Barely breathe.\n\nShe told him to do something about it. They had launched a partnership that used market incentives to encourage sustainable ranching, garnering international attention. Maybe they could do something about the fires, too.\n\n\u201cThis frustration,\u201d she recalled telling him. \u201cYou just need to get it done.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe wrote a letter asking the Smokejumpers \u2014 the highly trained first responders who parachute into remote areas to fight wildfires \u2014 to train some locals here. To his surprise, they said they would do it.\n\nThe result, according to Douglas Morton, a NASA official and Amazon expert, was \u201cthe best-equipped and -trained\u201d privately organized brigade in the basin. The eight initial members roved, fighting fires and championing a counterintuitive premise: Ranchers were less a cause of the fires than part of the solution. They could be trained, too.\n\nOn nearby ranches, fires plummeted. In the forest of Alto Xingu, fires fell 77 percent where they patrol. Smoke diminished around John Carter\u2019s ranch, and local health officials registered a 25 percent drop in hospital visits for breathing problems.\n\n\u201cThis could be a model,\u201d said Britaldo Silveira Soares Filho, a researcher at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. \u201cWhen a firefighter is not someone you can go summon to go there and fight the fire, you have to train someone there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOr it will burn.\n\nCarter and Abreu hurried into the forest, dodging thorned fronds. They spotted horse tracks and followed them. But what they found a mile into the forest wasn\u2019t a squatter. It was a fire, burning low and hot.\n\nThey stared at it, wordless. They had called federal park authorities but were told the problem was the state\u2019s. They had called state park authorities but were told the Araguaia didn\u2019t have a patrol officer, let alone firefighters. They had called the police but were told an arrest could be made only if the arsonist was caught in the act.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the people or the knowledge to deal with this in the park,\u201d said Mariano Neto, the local police chief.\n\nThe only thing left was to put it out themselves.\n\nThe Amazon is burning\n\nBack at his house on Carter\u2019s ranch, Abreu pulled on his khaki coat, slid on his boots and tied his long knife around his waist. He was furious. Not only at the arsonist but also at how the broader story of the fires was being told.\n\nAD\n\nThe international outrage to him was artifice, whipped up to delegitimize Bolsonaro. Every year the forest burned, and every year more of it was knocked down. Where was the anger in 2007, when far more fires burned than this year? Where was it in 2010, when Mato Grosso was positively flammable, hitting double the number of fires as this year?\n\nTo Abreu, this year is barely discernible from most. All that\u2019s different is who\u2019s in power.\n\nThat was why, when people mocked Bolsonaro for saying his critics had started the fires to make him look bad, Abreu didn\u2019t join in. On the frontier, with its endless cycle of violence and retribution, it made sense. Bolsonaro, in his calls to develop the Amazon, had \u201cassaulted with words\u201d the environmentalists and indigenous people. Some of the fires, Abreu believed, were payback. Others were deforestation. Others were simply to watch a beautiful thing burn.\n\nHe grabbed his hat. He climbed back onto the boat, picked up two other firefighters, crossed the river and went into the forest. The men carried nothing but machetes, a few jugs of drinking water and a leaf blower. Up ahead, smoke was rising. The sound of popping and crackling was everywhere.\n\nThe fire was now sweeping in length, the height of its flames reaching 20 feet \u2014 and growing.\n\n\u201cStrategy,\u201d Abreu said. \u201cLots of strategy.\u201d\n\nHe had no chance of extinguishing it. The fire was too big; the firefighters too few. The only option was containment. He would build a fire break \u2014 a gap in vegetation around the edge of the blaze \u2014 to box it in and let it burn out on its own. But when he charged toward the numbing heat, the flames lashed unpredictably.\n\n\u201cToo much!\u201d another firefighter yelled.\n\nThey retreated, fanning out across a half-mile front of fire. Abreu used his leaf blower to create the fire break. The others slashed at the brush with their machetes.\n\nThey battled until the sun was gone and the fire was no longer the hot orange of flame but the deep red of ember.\n\nWhat had taken one person seconds to light had taken three men hours to quell.\n\nThey started for Carter\u2019s ranch, exhausted, silent. They needed to rest. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the next fire was lit.", "description": "In one corner of the rainforest, the Alliance Brigade is attacking the flames and teaching ranchers how to help.", "authors": ["Terrence Mccoy", "Reporter Covering Social Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tDEy1XVp8zWUqw1INhyU_PK5Ayg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AVZ5OQXEOAI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
