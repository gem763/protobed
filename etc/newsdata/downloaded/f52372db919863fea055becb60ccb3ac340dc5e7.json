The company also reported a loss in its renewable energy business.\n\nGE confirmed its earnings-per-share forecasts and lifted its cash flow outlook, while lowering some of its cost projections.\n\n\u201cOur results reflect another quarter of progress in the transformation of GE,\u201d said Chief Executive Lawrence Culp.\n\n\u201cWe have more work to do, and we will continue to take actions to improve our financial position and strengthen our businesses as we prepare for 2020 and beyond.\u201d\n\nShares rose 5.5 percent to $9.57 in pre-market trading.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 General Electric reported mixed third-quarter results Wednesday in its industrial businesses and cited progress in a turnaround", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/52139d_electric-shares-rose-as-it-reported-mixed-industrial-results-it-was-making-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
