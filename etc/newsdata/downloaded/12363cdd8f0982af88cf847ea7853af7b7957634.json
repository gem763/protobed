After all, veterans should put country before party and veteran welfare before partisan interests. While that once may have been true, it no longer appears to be.\n\nInstead, many prominent veteran service organizations (VSOs), military service organizations (MSOs) and veteran advocacy groups, most headquartered in Washington, either have outsourced their higher education agendas to the extreme left or have been infiltrated by Democratic strategists \u2014 and may not even know it. Either way, when it comes to the GI Bill and veterans\u2019 educational choice, the truth is staring us in the face: Many veteran groups now primarily support a leftist, anti-choice higher education agenda.\n\nConsider this:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmerica\u2019s largest veterans\u2019 organization, the American Legion, quietly changed its position from being skeptical of anti-veteran educational choice policies in higher education to now carrying the partisan banner of the left. I suppose this is not a big surprise. After all, in a recent media profile, one member of the American Legion described it as once having led on issues but now riding the coattails of others.\n\nThe flip-flop may be an extension of the Legion\u2019s anti-President Trump staff. Many veterans\u2019 groups lose credibility because of their lack of balance and ridiculous claim of being nonpartisan. If that were true, they would actively listen to all veterans, instead of backing partisan views. But they stay in their Washington headquarters and, lately, have been taking their marching orders from Democratic sources.\n\nCarrie Wofford, a self-described Democratic strategist and one of the lead staffers behind a partisan Senate Committee report that violated \u201ca long history of bipartisanship and collaboration,\u201d founded Veterans Education Success (VES) in 2013. Predictably, the report condemned the taxpaying sector involved in career, technical and trade education \u2014 labeled as \u201cfor-profit colleges\u201d by the left and their friends in the liberal media. Clear-thinking Republicans described the effort as nakedly partisan, one conducted in a way that \u201cundermined the credibility\u201d of its findings. This report, however, became a launching pad for a crusade against the taxpaying education sector that now exists under the banner of VES.\n\nOne glance at the VES leadership reveals the group\u2019s leftist ideology. Three out of five board members have previous Democratic affiliations. Another unsuccessfully ran for elected office in California as, you guessed it, a Democrat.\n\nThe most disturbing arc in this development is not the creation of a left-leaning front group by a non-veteran Democrat, but the blind allegiance to this organization by longstanding veteran groups led by actual veterans. Too many of these groups are endorsing partisan letters credited to the left-leaning VES.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVES and its coalition of veteran groups recently criticized Sen. Lamar Alexander Andrew (Lamar) Lamar AlexanderGOP braces for impeachment brawl McConnell tightlipped as impeachment furor grows GOP senator: 'Inappropriate' to discuss opponents, but impeachment a 'mistake' MORE (R-Tenn.) for his bipartisan efforts to advance higher education legislation and called for the inclusion of a partisan policy endorsed exclusively by Democrats. These same groups, however, remained eerily silent as Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Partnership for America's Health Care Future \u2014 ObamaCare premiums dropping for 2020 | Warren, Buttigieg shift stances on 'Medicare for All' | Drug companies spend big on lobbying Mellman: Trumping peace and prosperity On The Money: Waters clashes with Trump officials over 'disastrous' housing finance plan | Dems jump into Trump turf war over student loans | House passes bill targeting anonymous shell companies MORE (D-Mass.) proposed to eliminate choice for veterans at private career, technical and vocational schools.\n\nThink about that. Veteran groups criticized a Republican leader for being bipartisan but did not utter a word when a progressive politician, seeking the Democratic nomination for president, put forth a proposal so extreme it is doubtful even her fellow Democrats will get behind it.\n\nMission creep is something we learn about in the military. Going off mission, or outside of your core competencies, hurts the overall focus of a unit or military campaign. The VSOs and MSOs get away with this kind of mission creep by rubber-stamping left-leaning, anti-veterans\u2019 choice letters because the general public is not paying attention and the left-leaning mainstream media will never call them out for it.\n\nThis leads to a leftist groupthink that now pervades the VSO/MSO community and is incredibly problematic, leading to a partisan approach on higher education policymaking. This approach ignores the needs of veterans and elevates the special interests of partisans. Veterans want choices. They are smart enough to choose. It is time for Congress to listen to veterans instead of the D.C.-based groups drunk on the swamp.\n\nPete Hegseth is a veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and the co-host of Fox News\u2019s Fox & Friends Weekend.
