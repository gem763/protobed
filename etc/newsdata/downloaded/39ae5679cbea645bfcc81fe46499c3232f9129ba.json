Pedro Le\u00f3n equalized in the 77th after a blunder by Sevilla defenders and Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Vald\u00e9s \u201cCote\u201d gave the hosts the win with a well-placed free kick in the 82nd.\n\nIt was the first win of the season for Eibar, which had entered the match second-to-last in the 20-team standings with two points from five games.\n\nSevilla was coming off a 1-0 home loss to Real Madrid. It could have moved within a point from Madrid\u2019s lead, but ended up dropping to seventh place.\n\nLucas Ocampos and \u00d3liver Torres scored Sevilla\u2019s goals in the first half.\n\nLe\u00f3n\u2019s equalizer came after Sevilla defender Diego Carlos and goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik collided when going for a ball inside the area, leaving the Eibar midfielder free to score.\n\nCELTA RALLIES\n\nCelta Vigo salvaged a 1-1 home draw against Espanyol with a header by Santi Mina in the fifth and final minute of stoppage time.\n\nThe result left Espanyol in the relegation zone with five points from six matches. Celta, winless in four league games, moved to 15th place with six points.\n\nReal Sociedad played against Alav\u00e9s later Thursday.\n\nReal Madrid took the league lead by beating promoted Osasuna 2-0 at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u on Wednesday. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid won 2-0 at Mallorca, while two-time defending champion Barcelona defeated Villarreal 2-1 at Camp Nou Stadium on Tuesday.\n\n__\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sevilla squandered a two-goal first-half lead to lose 3-2 at Eibar on Thursday, missing a chance to move near the top of the Spanish league.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tales Azzoni"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/spain_soccer_la_liga_45462_c0-233-5569-3480_s1770x1032.jpg?62ce1f6c8657e23e91059c1dc960a8e2c5dc35a7", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
