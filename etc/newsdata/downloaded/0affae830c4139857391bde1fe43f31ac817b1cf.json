They are reportedly examining Giuliani\u2019s efforts to oust then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nEarlier this week, two associates of Giuliani were indicted for campaign finance violations. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are accused of using a limited liability company to make political contributions related to American elections, in violation of FEC prohibitions against contributions from foreign nationals.\n\nBoth men have been linked to Giuliani\u2019s efforts to conduct investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s, and his son Hunter\u2019s, dealings in the country -- particularly connected to Hunter\u2019s ties to a Ukrainian gas company. Giuliani has acknowledged that both men \"logistically helped\" in his collection of evidence against Hunter Biden, and that they helped connect him with former Ukrainian top prosecutors Viktor Shokin and Yuriy Lutsenko.\n\nThe arrests came amid a growing impeachment inquiry related to President Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In that call, Trump asked the premier to \u201clook into\u201d the allegations about Biden. Opponents have accused Trump of withholding military aid to pressure the Ukrainians into investigating a political rival -- something Trump denies.\n\nEX-GOP CONGRESSMAN SAYS HE'LL DONATE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ARRESTED GIULIANI ASSOCIATES\n\nYovanovitch, the former Ukraine ambassador who was recalled in May, told lawmakers on Friday that she was removed after \u201cunfounded and false claims\u201d were made against her as well as continued pressure from Trump on the State Department to remove her.\n\nShe said, as for Giuliani, she was in contact with him three times as she can recall, none related to the controversy at hand -- and said that she did not know Giuliani\u2019s motives for going after her.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cBut individuals who may have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine,\u201d she said\n\nOn Saturday, Trump appeared to dismiss the claims against Giuliani, as well as the impeachment inquiry as a whole -- as he has done so multiple times before.\n\n\u201cSuch a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nFox News' Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump on Saturday gave his backing to Rudy Giulini, his personal attorney, after reports that the former New York City mayor is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possibly lobbying violations.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/12/694940094001_6094280038001_6094279557001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
