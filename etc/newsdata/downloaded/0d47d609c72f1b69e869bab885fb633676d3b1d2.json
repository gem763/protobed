Even in the very optimistic case of a livable planet that is not too far, say a few dozen light years, which is not a lot, it\u2019s in the neighbourhood, the time to go there is considerable,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about hundreds of millions of days using the means we have available today. We must take care of our planet, it is very beautiful and still absolutely liveable.\u201d\n\nThe 77-year-old said he felt the need to \u201ckill all the statements that say \u2018OK, we will go to a liveable planet if one day life is not possible on earth\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely crazy,\u201d he added.\n\nUsing custom-made instruments at their observatory in southern France, Mayor and Queloz in October 1995 discovered what had previously only existed in the realm of science fiction \u2014 a planet outside Earth\u2019s solar system.\n\nMayor was a professor at Geneva University and Queloz was his doctorate student, when they made the discovery which started a revolution in astronomy. Since then over 4,000 exoplanets have been found in our home galaxy.\n\n\u201cIt was a very old question which was debated by philosophers: are there other worlds in the Universe?,\u201d Mayor said.\n\n\u201cWe look for planets which are the closest (to us), which could resemble Earth. Together with my colleague we started this search for planets, we showed it was possible to study them.\u201d\n\nMayor said it was up to the \u201cnext generation\u201d to answer the question of whether there is life on other planets.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know! The only way to do it is to develop techniques that would allow us to detect life at a distance,\u201d he said.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 Humans will never migrate to a planet outside of Earth\u2019s solar system because it would take far too long to get there, Swiss", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/c223ea_humans-not-migrate-planets-nobel-winner-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
