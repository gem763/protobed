Celebrities including Usher, Judd Apatow, and Julia Roberts posted the note to their feeds, as did Rick Perry, the current United States secretary of energy and former Texas governor. The note and similar ones have been going around since 2012, and this is just their most recent resurgence.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no truth to this post.\u201d\n\nThe copied-and-pasted note has been spreading over the past day, warning of supposed changes to Instagram\u2019s privacy policy that\u2019ll give Instagram the power to \u201cuse your photos\u201d in various ways without consent.\n\nThe note includes a purported opt-out message that claims to forbid Instagram from using a person\u2019s information or \u201cdisclosing, copying, distributing, or taking\u201d any action against them based on what\u2019s posted to their profile. It says their profiles hold \u201cprivate and confidential information.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a total farce. \u201cThere\u2019s no truth to this post,\u201d Stephanie Otway, a spokesperson for Facebook, which owns Instagram, tells The Verge.\n\nTo put it simply: this message accomplishes nothing and makes no sense. Posting it on Instagram doesn\u2019t affect how Instagram treats your content.\n\nInstagram\u2019s policies grant it some basic uses of your photos and messages because it needs permission to display them to other users. As a clarification, the company\u2019s terms of service includes a bolded line that reads: \u201cWe do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.\u201d It also says you can end that license at any time \u201cby deleting your content or account.\u201d\n\nThe legal citations don\u2019t make a lot of sense\n\nInstagram can also share data and content with law enforcement, and it does so in response to warrants, court orders, or when believed it is necessary to prevent a crime. This is true of all internet services. These companies comply with legal requests from law enforcement and turn over whatever information they have, including account details and posts.\n\nThe legal citations in the hoax also don\u2019t make a lot of sense: the UCC is the Uniform Commercial Code, which forms the basis of state-level contract law and generally doesn\u2019t apply to copyright issues, and there\u2019s no such thing as UCC 1-308-11308. The closest thing, UCC 1-308, is in the definitions section and doesn\u2019t have any penalties, and it\u2019s mostly about reserving the right to sue even if you accept defective goods. The Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court in 1998, and, well, the ICC doesn\u2019t really care about your Instagram.\n\nUsing free services like Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter means agreeing to their terms and privacy policies. It also means accepting the fact that they can access your account details if necessary to assist in legal investigations. The only option to avoid this is to quit the services entirely. That said, the way in which this hoax spread likely speaks to the fact that people worry about how much control they really have over their own data.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that you don\u2019t fully control anything you share online, so long as you\u2019re using someone\u2019s else\u2019s service.", "description": "Celebrities and US government officials, including Rick Perry, all fell for an Instagram hoax in which they posted a note to their grids claiming ownership over their content.
