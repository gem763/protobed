One of those things has changed. Brace yourselves.\n\nJoe Keery, who plays Steve with the good hair, shocked fans by debuting a new \u2018do at a Chanel event on Thursday night in Los Angeles. You might even say that, wait for it, stranger things are happening with his new hair. Not only is Steve\u2019s trademark high-flying, Farrah Fawcett-worthy Faberg\u00e9 Organics groomed updo gone, but Keery has replaced it with a disheveled bowl cut with bangs \u2014 and the Internet may never recover.\n\nJoe Keery and Maika Monroe attend a Chanel event on September 12, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

Whatever the reason, fans took to Twitter to express their bewilderment over the drastic makeover and work through the stages of grief as they mourn the loss of those luscious locks.\n\nNow it\u2019s just a question of waiting for comment from everyone\u2019s (other) Hawkins fave Erica Sinclair, because she will undoubtedly have the best take.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "'Stranger Things' star Joe Keery\u2019s new bangs broke the Internet\u2019s heart this weekend", "authors": ["Melissa Locker"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/joe-keery-haircut.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
