(AP) - The spread between the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins kept growing this week, just as it has been doing for years, and just as it is expected to do Sunday.\n\nNew England began the week as a 14-point favorite Sunday, and the number steadily rose to 18\u00bd, pushed higher partly by the prospect of Patriots newcomer Antonio Brown running free through a hapless Dolphins secondary. The signal sent by bettors: They expect a rout.\n\nAnd no wonder. The defending Super Bowl champions drubbed Pittsburgh 33-3 in last week\u2019s season opener, while the perennial also-ran Dolphins were humiliated by Baltimore 59-10.\n\nNew England-Miami could be the NFL\u2019s biggest mismatch until Week 17, when they meet again in Foxborough. Here are things to know about the AP\u2019s No. 1-ranked team versus No. 32:\n\nANTONIO BROWN\n\nThe Dolphins couldn\u2019t cover Ravens rookie Marquis Brown, so they might have trouble with his cousin.\n\nMarquis Brown played only 14 snaps in his NFL debut but caught four passes for 147 yards and two scores against the Dolphins. Now they\u2019re bracing for another member of the Brown family, this one a four-time All-Pro receiver who signed Monday with the Patriots.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as dynamic as they get,\u201d Dolphins coach Brian Flores said.\n\nAntonio Brown\u2019s status was in doubt because of a civil lawsuit filed by his former trainer accusing him of sexually assaulting her on three occasions. Regardless of whether Brown plays, the Dolphins figure Tom Brady is especially eager to throw after watching them give up six touchdown passes against Baltimore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an air raid,\u201d Miami safety Bobby McCain predicted.\n\nHUMBLED DOLPHINS\n\nThe Dolphins and rookie coach Flores must shake off the shell shock from last week\u2019s shellacking, the most lopsided regular-season loss in team history.\n\nIn the wake of the embarrassment came rumblings that players are unhappy with the coaching staff, and with the organization\u2019s decision to make next year\u2019s draft a bigger priority than this year\u2019s roster. Disgruntled Miami Dolphins defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick requested and received permission to seek a trade, but he\u2019s expected to have a significant role in the game.\n\n\u201cI try to build relationships,\u201d Flores said. \u201cWhen you go through tough times, those relationships either get stronger or they don\u2019t. Last week was a part of that. Hopefully we come out of this stronger.\u201d\n\nPublicly, Flores\u2018 players expressed confidence the Dolphins can regroup.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get this thing turned around,\u201d receiver Jakeem Grant said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to come out and play a much better game.\u201d\n\nMiami gave up a franchise record 643 yards last week. And they weren\u2019t playing Brady.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we love the game - because we love challenges,\u201d Flores said with a grin. \u201cWe love to compete. To me, this is fun.\u201d\n\nLINE ADJUSTMENTS\n\nThe Patriots had to tinker with their offensive line before the opener after center David Andrews was placed on injured reserve. Ted Karras, who spent last season as a backup right guard but played 16 games at center in 2017, took Andrews\u2019 place.\n\nMore shuffling may be needed this week with right tackle Marcus Cannon recovering from a shoulder injury suffered against Pittsburgh. Joe Thuney, who normally starts at left guard, moved into Cannon\u2019s spot following the injury. If Thuney stays in Cannon\u2019s spot, candidates at left guard include Korey Cunningham and Jermaine Eluemunor.\n\nCunningham started six games at tackle as a rookie for Arizona. Eluemunor saw time at both guard and tackle for Baltimore the past two seasons.\n\nBAD MEMORIES\n\nDespite being big favorites, the Patriots insist they aren\u2019t taking the Dolphins lightly. Part of the reason is the Dolphins have won five of the last six meetings in Miami. That includes last year\u2019s stunner when Kenyan Drake scampered the final 52 yards after the Dolphins pulled off a pass and double lateral on the final play for a 34-33 victory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenging place to play,\u201d Brady said. \u201cLast year I thought we played a pretty good game, but in football, a lot of crazy things happen.\u201d\n\nCOACH\u2019S ROOTS\n\nFlores worked for the Patriots for 15 seasons in a variety of roles, and was defensive play caller for last year\u2019s Super Bowl champions. He said he thinks back often to his time with New England.\n\n\u201cThis role is very different,\u201d he said. \u201cBack in those days, I was one of the guys. I\u2019m not one of the guys anymore. I\u2019m the guy everybody kind of walks away from.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Kyle Hightower in Foxborough, Massachusetts, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The spread between the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins kept growing this week, just as it has been doing for years, and just as it is expected to do Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steven Wine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/patriots_antonio_brown_lawsuit_football_71087_c0-296-4500-2919_s1770x1032.jpg?07f7ba04f90933ecf8163263a40567ff19c942da"}
