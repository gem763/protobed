Mr Wright claims the City regulator has been complicit in a long-running cover-up of alleged market abuse by taxpayer-backed RBS \u2013 misconduct that cost some of the bank\u2019s employees much of their life savings.\n\nAccording to him, on 17 September 2008, days before RBS was bailed out with billions of pounds of taxpayer funds, senior RBS executives posted a note on the bank\u2019s intranet reassuring staff about its financial position.\n\nThe note remained on the bank\u2019s internal system for several months, during which time RBS\u2019 share price collapsed from around \u00a360 to a low of 10p \u2013 wiping out shareholders, including employees who had been encouraged to invest in the company, Mr Wright\u2019s account concludes.\n\nAfter he blew the whistle on this and other alleged misconduct at RBS, the FCA reported his name back to his former employer even though identities of whistleblowers must be kept secret. After an investigation by the Complaints Commissioner, the FCA eventually apologised to Mr Wright for disclosing his identity.\n\nBut the bigger issue is that the FCA had denied the existence of such an RBS statement about its financial health \u2013 before eventually admitting that one did exist and that the FCA had a copy of it.\n\nThat admission came only after Mr Wright obtained emails last year from the Complaints Commissioner that confirmed the FCA had known about the intranet statement for five years.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He later clarified that, saying he meant that the fact that such a statement existed had been in the public domain for ten years \u2013 but the statement itself had never been made public. Mr Bailey maintains that his position on the matter has been consistent throughout.\n\nRBS has refused requests from Sir Norman, Mr Wright and The Independent to publish the statement, and the FCA says it is prevented by law from doing so.\n\nAn RBS spokesperson said: \u201cThis bank-wide, internal message was for internal use only to ensure staff remained focused on serving their customers during a period of market turmoil.\u201d\n\nAfter being questioned again about the issue at the FCA\u2019s annual meeting, Mr Bailey wrote to Mr Wright to say the FCA had responded in detail to the matter and now considered it closed.\n\nBut Sir Norman does not consider it closed.\n\n\u201cIt is remarkable that the financial regulator of this country is not permitted to publish a very significant document that is at the fulcrum of the storm of 2008,\u201d Sir Norman said.\n\n\u201cIf it is an entirely defensible statement that will do no harm to RBS, then publish it.\u201d\n\nIf any information were to be published that demonstrated RBS had misled shareholders to their detriment, it could give rise to legal action, potentially damaging the value of the Treasury\u2019s multibillion-pound stake in the bank.\n\nAn FCA spokesperson said: \"Any suggestion Andrew Bailey misled Norman Lamb MP is completely rejected.\n\n\"We have written to all relevant parties to explain why that isn\u2019t the case but they have repeatedly chosen to misinterpret the evidence. Given this has been comprehensively investigated and independently reviewed the FCA has nothing further to add and we will be writing to Norman Lamb to explain our position.\"", "description": "A high-profile MP is demanding an apology from the head of Britain\u2019s financial watchdog after it accused him of making \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d statements about its treatment of an RBS whistleblower.
