A survey published on Monday by Kicker magazine showed 77 percent of 96,000 people who responded want Hummels back in Germany\u2019s famous white shirt.\n\n\u201cLoew has so far ruled out a return of Hummels, arguing that it was necessary to leave room for Suele, but injury to this promising player will force him to review his strategy,\u201d said Kicker in an editorial.\n\nLoew\u2019s decision in March to send Hummels and his Bayern teammates Thomas Mueller and Jerome Boateng into international retirement sent shockwaves through German football.\n\nHummels, who made 70 appearances for Germany, said at the time that he did not bear a grudge against Loew but admitted that he had been stunned.\n\n\u201cI took a blow to the head and didn\u2019t really know what was going on,\u201d he said.\n\nHummels has since rediscovered his best form back with Dortmund and produced a commanding display last month when Barcelona were held to a goalless draw at Signal Iduna Park in their opening Group F match.\n\nAnd after Suele, Loew\u2019s defensive cornerstone, tore his cruciate knee against Augsburg on Saturday, ruling him out of action for at least six months, Hummels might just be the right man in the right place.\n\n\u2013 \u2018If it comes, it comes\u2019 \u2013\n\nWhile Loew described the news as \u201cvery bad\u201d, Bayern president Uli Hoeness was more direct.\n\n\u201cApparently, the season is over for him (Suele),\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cHe can forget about the Euros.\u201d\n\nSuele\u2019s injury is, indeed, bad news all round although Bayern can adjust as 2018 World Cup winners Lucas Hernandez and Benjamin Pavard, as well as Boateng, can all fill in at centre-back.\n\nHowever, Germany lack the same strength in depth and Freund was blunt about Germany\u2019s chances at the Euro 2020 finals, which start in June, if Hummels is not recalled.\n\n\u201cIf we go to the European Championships with (Antonio) Ruediger and (Matthias) Ginter, we won\u2019t be European champions,\u201d said Freund.\n\nHe describes Suele\u2019s injury as a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for Germany, making Hummels\u2019 recall all the more urgent before next month\u2019s final two Euro 2020 qualifiers against Belarus and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Germans are currently neck-and-neck with the Netherlands at the top of their group with the top two teams qualifying.\n\nDortmund coach Lucien Favre insisted last month, before Suele was even injured, that Hummels should \u201cwithout question\u201d be part of Loew\u2019s plans.\n\nFor his part, Hummels said in August that he is ready, willing and able.\n\n\u201cIf I had the opportunity to wear the national team jersey again, I wouldn\u2019t refuse,\u201d he said, adding that he wouldn\u2019t be holding his breath.\n\n\u201cI try to think about it as little as possible. If it comes, it comes.\u201d\n\nHummels is right to be pessimistic as Loew is known for stubbornly sticking to decisions once his mind is made up.\n\nHowever, another good performance by Hummels in Milan on Wednesday might help sway Germany\u2019s 2014 World Cup winning coach into a rethink.", "description": "Dortmund (Germany) (AFP) \u2013 There are renewed calls in Germany for national head coach Joachim Loew to recall Mats Hummels just months after telling", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/5445b9_germany-coach-jogi-loew-is-increasing-pressure-recall-retired-defender-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
