But whether a company pays a dividend isn\u2019t the only factor to consider.\n\nTom Huber, portfolio manager of the actively managed $13.2 billion T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth fund, says investors should consider sectors before diving in to add dividend investments. He cites utilities, real estate investment trusts, and, more recently, consumer staples as examples of sectors with dividend-paying stocks that have held up well over the past five years.\n\nTo assess how dividend stocks fared against the Russell 1000 Value Index, Barron\u2019s looked at five income-oriented large-cap value exchange-traded funds that have outperformed the index over the past five years. They appear in the accompanying table.\n\nValue Kicker It\u2019s been a tough stretch for value stocks, but dividends have offered some ballast to the mix. Data as of Oct. 21; Morningstar defines a trailing 12-month yield as the sum of a fund\u2019s interest and dividend payments divided by the last month\u2019s ending share price, plus any capital gains distributed over the same period; *Annualized Source: Morningstar\n\nWhen it comes to total return, these five ETFs have the advantage that all of their holdings pay dividends, while about 20% of the 766 companies in the value index don\u2019t offer a payout\u2014juicing relative performance by adding more income to the mix. Dividend stocks have also been helped by the low-interest-rate environment.\n\nETFs also have a cost advantage, reflected in their relatively low management fees compared with actively run funds. ETFs, which typically track indexes, often don\u2019t have to spend as much time on fundamental stock research and portfolio positioning the way actively managed funds do.\n\nYet while dividend streams can damp some stock volatility, especially as earnings growth slows and the income piece of total return becomes more important, Huber points out that the sector weightings of these funds are important, too.\n\nFor example, a fund that had a heavy tilt toward utilities\u2014which have a had a good run, as evidenced by the 11.3% five-year return of the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (ticker: XLU)\u2014would probably outperform one with less exposure to the sector.\n\nThe Russell 1000 Value Index\u2019s biggest sector weighting, as of Sept. 30, was financials at nearly 30%, followed by health care at 11.7% and consumer discretionary at 11.1%. The utility weighting was recently 11%, while technology, a key driver of stock returns in recent years, has a relatively small weighting in the index of 6.1%.\n\nBut the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY), which has a five-year annual return of 11.29%, performed well against these other funds without much exposure to information-technology stocks, at least recently. It was about 3%.\n\nThe fund\u2019s recent top three sector weightings were industrials, financials, and consumer staples. As of Oct. 22, its top two holdings were AT&T (T) and pharmaceutical firm AbbVie (ABBV).\n\nThe fund, which comprised about 110 holdings, draws from the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index. Culled from the S&P Composite 1500, these stocks have all increased their dividends for at least 20 straight years.\n\n\u201cThe fund\u2019s focus on firms that are financially healthy enough to grow their payouts favors profitable companies with durable competitive advantages and shareholder-friendly management teams,\u201d noted Venkata Sai Uppaluri, a Morningstar analyst, last month.\n\nStill, dividends played a role in its solid performance.\n\nTwo funds whose biggest sector allocation is technology are the WisdomTree US LargeCap Dividend ETF (DLN) and FlexShares Quality Dividend ETF (QDF). Their five-year annual returns are 10.26% and 9.19%, respectively, placing them in third and fifth place on our list.\n\nCompared with the Russell 1000 Value Index, the Quality Dividend fund was recently underweight utility stocks, which have performed well in recent years, and it had a small overweighting in health-care stocks, which have been challenged recently.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe WisdomTree fund, which has close to 300 holdings, draws its holdings from the WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend Index. It weights its holdings by the dividend streams that each company is expected to pay in a coming year, not market capitalization. The fund is rebalanced once a year. Its second-largest weighting was recently financials, followed by consumer staples, health care, and industrials. Compared with the Russell 1000 Value Index, it tilts away from materials, utilities, and consumer-discretionary stocks.\n\nThe Vanguard High Dividend Yield fund (VYM), which finished fourth with a 9.72% return, recently had about 10% of its portfolio in tech stocks\u2014higher than the value index but well below several of its peers. Its biggest concentration was in financials at 18.5%, followed by consumer goods and health care.\n\nThe Schwab US Dividend Equity fund (SCHD) has loaded up on consumer-staples stocks, its largest sector position as of Sept. 30. Its holdings are drawn from the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which is partly \u201cdesigned to measure the performance of high-dividend-yielding stocks issued by U.S. companies that have a record of consistently paying dividends,\u201d according to the fund\u2019s prospectus. Its returns have been bolstered by an 18% weighting in the tech sector, its second largest.\n\nThe fund\u2019s 12-month yield was recently 3.04%, second only to the Vanguard\u2019s 3.16% yield among the five funds.\n\nSo while dividends have helped bolster many value stocks, investors should know that the yield is only one piece of the puzzle.\n\nWrite to Lawrence C.
