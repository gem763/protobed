According to a July article from The New Yorker, \u201csome of Biden\u2019s advisers were worried that Hunter, by meeting with a business associate during his father\u2019s visit, would expose the Vice-President to criticism.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe got kicked out of the Navy. All of the sudden he\u2019s getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a payoff,\u201d Trump said of the younger Biden.\n\nRomney, long a critic of President Trump, initially released a statement on impeachment proceedings Sept. 22. \u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,\u201d it reads.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in a different place from many politicians still feeling out their place in the party and hoping to be president someday,\u201d Senator Christopher Murphy (D., Conn.), who serves with on the Foreign Relations Committee, said of Romney to The New York Times on Sept. 26. \u201cHe\u2019s a loyal Republican, but that\u2019s not his first priority \u2014 he\u2019s a bit of a throwback.\u201d", "description": "Senator Mitt Romney (R., Utah) released a statement Friday condemning President Trump\u2019s claim that China should look into Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
