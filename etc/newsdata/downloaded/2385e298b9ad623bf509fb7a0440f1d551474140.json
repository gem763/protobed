He explained that, for Iran, this Syria denouement is ideal: \u201cWho could offer them a situation better than that?\u201d\n\nLebanese anxiety about U.S. reversals in Syria is largely a matter of self-interest. Lebanon survives by maintaining a balance between East and West, Iran and Saudi Arabia, Sunnis and Shiites, Christians and Muslims. What has helped keep this precarious structure alive for decades was the belief that the United States, in the end, wouldn\u2019t let the country be dominated entirely by enemies of the West.\n\nBut any remaining faith in U.S. power was jolted last week. Hasan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, gloated the day after the Turkish invasion: \u201cAmericans can\u2019t be trusted at all since they break promise with anyone who depends on them.\u201d Other Lebanese found it hard to disagree.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s a suggestion for a Trump administration that needs to reassert its interests in the Middle East: Double down on Lebanon, a country where the United States already provides significant economic and military support. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who says he wants a stronger Lebanon, should condition this additional aid on specific economic reforms that can stem the corruption that\u2019s almost as serious a threat as Hezbollah.\n\nSome administration officials argue that Beirut is already a lost cause: Hezbollah is the dominant political force here, so let Iran worry about a collapsing Lebanon, they contend. But that argument is wrong, especially now. The last thing the Middle East needs is another failed state, especially one on Israel\u2019s border. A stronger Lebanese state would hurt Hezbollah rather than help it.\n\nThe United States is already providing about $200 million annually in equipment and training for the Lebanese military and security forces, U.S. officials say. And it\u2019s the largest aid donor for the estimated 1.3 million Syrian war refugees here. The United States should encourage Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other regional powers that oppose Iran to put more money into Lebanon, too. But the United States needs to convince the Gulf states that their money won\u2019t just disappear down the drain of Lebanese corruption.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat would a stronger Lebanese state look like? First, it would be better able to assert its sovereignty, starting with borders. To that end, the United States should push to resume back-channel negotiations to define a land and maritime border between Lebanon and Israel. The talks began this year, under a United Nations umbrella, but then foundered. And down the road, the United States should help Lebanon establish a real, smuggler-proof border with Syria.\n\nIn return for deepening its support, the United States should demand some urgent reforms. Lebanon needs a modern telecommunications regulatory authority, as a first step toward privatization of the largely state-owned telecommunications sector that could raise $6 billion. It needs to privatize its inept state-run electricity company, too, which could save up to $2 billion.\n\nLebanon\u2019s sectarian political system now divvies up the spoils in these two key sectors, along with about 100 other small state-owned enterprises. Hezbollah probably gets the largest share, but all the other sects and factions take their cuts. It\u2019s a rotten system, and it\u2019s long past time for change.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe chief enemy of a strong, sovereign Lebanon is Hezbollah, which profits from chaos. It follows that a stronger Lebanon will, over time, weaken the Shiite militia. Bankrupting Lebanon to pressure Iran, as some U.S. officials suggest, would be one more act of folly for a Trump administration that has made far too many mistakes in the Middle East already.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Beirut feels it\u2019s the next to be discarded by the United States.", "authors": ["David Ignatius", "Columnist Covering Foreign Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lXDkub_xZyCd4BrUmJcQZxqxt3g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/COSHPDWGNII6PBF4LYUFY72FCI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
