Austin Miller said at a news conference in Kabul. \"Unbeknownst to the public, as part of our optimization \u2026 we reduced our authorized strength by 2,000 here.\"\n\n\"I'm confident that we have the right capabilities to: 1. Reach our objectives as well as continue train, advise, and assist throughout the country,\" Miller continued.\n\nThe New York Times was first to report that the US military had reduced its troop strength in Afghanistan even though peace talks with the Taliban are on hiatus.

Most recently, he approved withdrawing most US troops from Syria.\n\nOn Monday, Esper said the situations in Syria and Afghanistan are very different, so the Afghans and other US allies \"should not misinterpret our actions in the recent week or so with regard to Syria.\"", "description": "Even though the number of troops on the ground has shrunk, the US military has increased both air and ground attacks.", "authors": ["Jeff Schogol", "Task"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d12f30de3ecba20e97fbdb3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
