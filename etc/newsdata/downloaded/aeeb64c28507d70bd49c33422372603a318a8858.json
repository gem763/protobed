You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my job to be a sympathy person. My job is to coach England. I find that the most bizarre question, I really do,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cI spoke to Michael. Of course he was heartbroken. One of us was going to be like that, weren\u2019t we? That\u2019s what it is, that\u2019s what happens now. If you win you are happy, if you lose you are bloody sad. But it\u2019s not the job of the winning coach to have sympathy for the losing coach, and it\u2019s not the job of the losing coach to be happy for the winning coach.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If we had lost on Saturday, you guys would have been coming at me hard. You know that.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get too emotional and silly about this ... I\u2019m not an Australian, I\u2019m coaching England, I\u2019m an England coach.\u201d\n\nInstead of going home, England are preparing this week to take on New Zealand, the reigning back-to-back world champions who obliterated Ireland\u2019s hopes on Saturday in a 46-14 demolition.\n\n\u201cYou always want to play the best and they are the best \u2013 no one can dispute that,\u201d Jones added. \u201cIf you want to be the best in the world you have to beat the best. For the players and coaches this is the best week of their lives and you have to enjoy it and make sure you focus on yourself and work to get better.\n\n\u201cNZ are a great team with a great coach and a great captain but like any team they are beatable and there are ways to beat them, and we will be investigating every possible way of how we beat them this week.\n\n\u201cIf you look at their record I don't think there's a team that comes close to them for sustainability. Since the last World Cup, I think they've won nearly 90 per cent of their Tests. Name me another team in the world that plays at the absolute top level that wins 90 per cent of their games?\n\n\u201cThey are playing in the toughest competition in the world against the best all the time. I just admire them. To do what they do from a small country is incredible, it's an example of what you can do. People are raving about Japan at the moment and it's fantastic but you look at what New Zealand have done with 4m people. They produce this rugby team that has a 90 per cent winning record. 90 per cent? You have to admire them. But then the challenge is to beat them.\u201d\n\nIreland went into Saturday\u2019s quarter-final full of confidence that they could cause an upset, having beaten New Zealand twice in their last three meetings, but found themselves 22-0 down by half-time and 34-0 down before scoring their first point, having seen their game plan completely dismantled by the All Blacks.\n\n\u201cI think what happens is you become part of the show,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI thought that happened a bit last night. Ireland really got stuck in when the game was lost. Against any of the best teams, you have to go hard from the start. That\u2019s going to be important for us.\u201d\n\nEngland have no further injury concerns coming out of the match, although Jonny May will be closely monitored this week after injuring his hamstring against Australia and Jack Nowell will have to prove his fitness Tuesday if he is to stand any chance of featuring due to a similar issue.", "description": "On the day that Michael Cheika resigned as Australia\u00a0coach, Eddie Jones stressed that the thin lines between success and failure left him without sympathy towards his home nation after dumping them out of the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/20/13/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
