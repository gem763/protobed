(Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHoward Hankins rescued the giant busts of former U.S. presidents from the closed Presidents Park in Colonial Williamsburg when he was commissioned to destroy them.\n\nHankins had helped construct Presidents Park, and while he wasn\u2019t necessarily in the position to inherit 43 humongous heads, he didn\u2019t have the heart to destroy them, either.\n\nThe busts of former presidents \u2014 from George Washington to George W. Bush \u2014 are 18 to 20 feet, each weighing between 11,000 and 20,000 pounds.\n\nThere are two glaring omissions from the array of busts: Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Presidents Park ran out of funding before it could commission a full-sized bust after Obama was elected in 2008, and the park closed in 2010, well before Trump took office.\n\nPhotography by Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSee more news-related photo galleries and follow us on Yahoo News Photo Twitter and Tumblr.\n\nPeople tour the decaying remains of salvaged busts of former US Presidents August 25, 2019, in Williamsburg, Virginia.
