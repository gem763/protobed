I sent a picture to him, my mom and best friend - they all had different opinions,\u2019 Cibuls told Yahoo.\n\nA mother-of-two from Illinois was given the fright of a lifetime when she thought she saw a the ghost of baby sleeping next to her son in his crib on a monitor, only to discover the truth the following day \u2013 realizing her husband was to blame\n\nMaritza Cibuls, 32, first spotted the ghoulish face of an infant staring back at her through her 18-month-old\u2019s baby monitor moments after she put him to bed last Thursday\n\nArmed with a flashlight and determined to get to the bottom of the spooky sighting, the frightened mother crept into her son\u2019s room and felt around is crib for any clues.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t see anything unusual in the crib at all. I was trying to feel around to see if there was any wetness - we thought there might be some drool on the sheet - but I didn\u2019t feel any.\n\n\u2018I told myself maybe it was just a stain on the sheet and left the room. I probably went in there about three more times throughout the night.\u2019\n\nCibuls, who also has a two-year-old daughter, said she couldn\u2019t sleep or even relax with the thought of the ghostly apparition continuing to trouble her.\n\nThe mother says she slept the entire night with the monitor pressed up against her face, with the volume on full and brightness turned all the way up.\n\n\u2018I kept opening my eyes to check to make sure the \u2018ghost\u2019 wasn\u2019t moving. Then when I would start to finally relax, my son would roll over and I\u2019d be on high alert again. Every time I checked on him, though, he seemed completely fine,\u2019 she told Yahoo.\n\nBut the next morning, the logical reason behind the image was finally revealed when she opened the blinds and checked her son\u2019s mattress.\n\n\u2018Immediately, it was so obvious there was something underneath the sheet. I pulled the sheet off and saw a giant baby face printed on the sticker.\u2019\n\nBut the next morning, the logical reason behind the image was finally revealed when she opened the blinds and checked her son\u2019s mattress. \u2018Immediately, it was so obvious there was something underneath the sheet. I pulled the sheet off and saw a giant baby face printed on the sticker\u2019\n\nThe 32-year-old said she had never seen the sticker through the sheet before as she always uses a mattress protector \u2013 something her husband had forgotten to put on the night before.\n\n\u2018My husband, Corey, changed the sheets the other night while I changed my son, who had woken up crying and wet. But I made him do it in the dark so we didn\u2019t shock my son and wake him up completely,\u2019 she explained.\n\n\u2018Apparently, he didn\u2019t think to put another mattress protector back on.\u2019\n\nWhen she told Corey that he\u2019d forgotten to replace the mattress, at first he failed to see the significance. Then when she told him why, the couple shared a big laugh.\n\nCibuls shared the hilarious story to Facebook on Friday afternoon, joking in reference to her husband\u2019s mistake that she \u2018could kill him.\u2019\n\nThe post has since received more than 500,000 likes and over 300,000 shares.", "description": "Maritza Cibuls, 32, from Illinois, first spotted the ghoulish face of an infant staring back at her through her 18-month-old's baby monitor moments after she put him to bed last Thursday.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/17/20043546-0-image-a-32_1571760003595.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
