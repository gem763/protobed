And, she still considers herself very young. She\u2019s not interested in rushing things.\u201d\n\nIt would seem that the small matter of having a loving and constant partner is one of the prerequisites of starting a family.\n\nKendall can be reasonably private about her dating life, so it would be a surprise if a father-in-waiting is revealed any time soon.\n\nA second source told Hollywood Life the model \"wants to eventually have a family, but she wants to be in a fully committed relationship to make it all happen.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThey went on to explain that Kendall was speculating about having a family, as she enjoys having these conversations with her sisters.\n\nThey went on to say: \"She isn\u2019t going to have a baby just to have one, but talking with her sisters about it is a way for them to relate to each other.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in KUWTK, Kendall told Kim Kardashian: \"I can\u2019t wait to have a kid. I\u2019m going to make him do the coolest things, so when he\u2019s older, he\u2019s just a stud.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nKendall's fans will be disappointed that it was just talk and the source confirmed: \"It\u2019s fun to talk about, but then reality sets in it\u2019s a different story.\n\n\"So many other things have to fall into place. Saying it and rushing into it are two totally separate things all together.\n\n\"There will be no pregnancy announcements from Kendall anytime soon.\"\n\nPresumably someone has told momager Kris Jenner, so that she doesn't start knitting some booties any time soon.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
