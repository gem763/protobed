So it is for Away\u2019s Jen Rubio, who co-founded the company in 2016 with friend Steph Korey to solve the problem of poorly designed luggage. Though launched with a four-person team as a direct-to-consumer operation, today they sell in nearly 40 countries with seven retail stores across the U.S. and in London.\n\nBeyond providing quality luggage and other travel products (they are also eyeing skincare and apparel), the brand aims to \u201ctransform the entire travel experience.\u201d It\u2019s a bold ambition, but Rubio, an alumni of Warby Parker, has the chutzpah to back it up. She has been included in \u201c30 Under 30\u201d lists in both Forbes and Inc. Time deemed Away one of the world\u2019s \u201c50 Most Genius Companies of 2018.\u201d Her favorite motto is, \u201cIf not now, then when?\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s idea for Away was seeded in 2015, while rushing through the Zurich airport with a broken suitcase. The original plan was to do for luggage what Warby Parker did for glasses: cut out the middleman with chic, well-made direct-to-consumer goods. So far, so good.\n\nBased in New York City, Rubio flies around 200,000 miles a year, and has been to over 50 countries. We reached out to hear about some of her favorite things the world over.\n\nMy favorite neighborhood in the world is\u2026 Kitsilano in Vancouver. This comes as a surprise to everyone who knows me\u2014I\u2019m a city girl who\u2019s lived in and around SoHo in New York for a decade\u2014but Kits has the perfect mix of restaurants, neighborhood-y shops, and outdoor activities, which almost makes me think I could have this lifestyle. I love sipping rare teas at O5, dinner at AnnaLena (check out the chef\u2019s KAWS collection while you\u2019re there), and walking it all off at Kits Beach.\n\nThe one thing in my kitchen I can\u2019t live without is\u2026 a tiny Nespresso machine, which kickstarts my day in a not-very-elegant way. In fact, I moved it to my nightstand, and I have my first cup of espresso while I\u2019m still in bed. If I\u2019m staying at an Airbnb or a villa and I\u2019m not sure about the coffee situation, I\u2019ve been known to pack the machine and a sleeve of pods in my suitcase.\n\nIf I were to buy a piece of art, it would be by\u2026 Alicja Kwade. Her Met Rooftop sculptures got to me in all the right places: metaphysics, materials, and size. I can never decide if I want to stare at her pieces or interact with them.\n\nThe best book I\u2019ve read in the last year is\u2026 Fleishman Is In Trouble, Taffy Brodesser-Akner. I loved every profile she wrote for the New York Times and her ability to narrate human nuance is astounding.\n\nA passion of mine that few people know about is\u2026 my love for elephants. I\u2019m a big supporter of the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, an elephant orphanage in Kenya. I\u2019m organizing a trip there soon to see all of my adoptees in person.\n\nThe one trip I\u2019ve taken that I would love to do again\u2026 Antarctica. I went in 2011, but only got a taste of the peninsula and the South Shetland Islands. Next time\u2014and there will be a next time!\u2014I\u2019m going for the South Pole.\n\nThe next destination on my travel itinerary is\u2026 Naoshima, the art island in Japan. Just two weeks in advance, we managed to snag a room at the Benesse, which is a stunning museum and hotel. Lucky!\n\nThe thing that gets me up in the morning is\u2026 that espresso machine on my nightstand. But when I\u2019m up up? The fact that I get to spend my day building and creating new things. The dream.\n\nThe restaurant/bar in my hometown that I love to take a visitor to is\u2026 La Mercerie. Whenever I take people there, they\u2019re like, \u201cAre we getting drinks in a furniture store?\u201d But the cocktails, food, and atmosphere rival a lot of other restaurants in Manhattan, plus you\u2019re surrounded by the beautiful goods that Roman & Williams have curated.\n\nA person who inspired me to do what I do is\u2026 my co-founder, Steph Korey. I never set out to be an entrepreneur, but when I called her to complain about the dearth of luggage options, she steered me into thinking that we could solve it ourselves.", "description": "Vancouver\u2019s Kitsilano neighborhood, her bedside Nespresso machine, art by Alicja Kwade, and more", "authors": ["Brent Crane"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-106163/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
