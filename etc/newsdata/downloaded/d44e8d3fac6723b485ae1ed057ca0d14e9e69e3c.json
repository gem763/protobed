She\u2019s a cousin of my husband, and her father was very helpful when my third son had a terrible motorbike accident and was in a coma.\n\nHelena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret in The Crown (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018Anyway she said, \u201cCan I come and see you? I just want to talk to you about Princess Margaret.\u201d She came and she\u2019s wonderful, she\u2019s going to be the most perfect Princess Margaret.\n\n\u2018I mean she\u2019s the right size, she looks right. They\u2019ve got the sort of intelligence of Princess Margaret with her, she wanted to know everything about her. She\u2019s got the right voice.\u2019\n\nDespite admitting to only watching the show \u2018occasionally\u2019 on certain episodes, she believes Vanessa Kirby, who played the princess in the first two seasons, wasn\u2019t an ideal fit.\n\nAfter Janet Street-Porter brought up Vanessa, Lady Glenconner replied: \u2018Yes she was. I didn\u2019t think she was quite right.\n\n\u2018But that was only my opinion.\u2019\n\nVanessa Kirby as Margaret in The Crown seasons one and two (Picture: Netflix)\n\nShe was also partly inspired after book Ma\u2019am Darling by Craig Brown was published, which she claims was littered with false facts about the princess.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s partly why I wrote my book. I was so angry with his book. It was so untrue, he didn\u2019t know her, \u2018 Glenconner said.\n\n\u2018And what I really mind is all these people who write all this rubbish about people like Princess Margaret when they haven\u2019t even met them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She\u2019s such a friend and she was so wonderful to me. And I just wanted to put the record straight.\u2019\n\nYou can catch Loose Women weekdays on ITV at 12.30pm.\n\nMORE: Loose Women\u2019s Coleen Nolan slams Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for not stepping out of limelight\n\nMORE: Loose Women\u2019s Saira Khan close to tears over death of father ahead of Prince Harry documentary", "description": "Lady Glenconner believes Helena Bonham Carter will be the 'perfect' Princess Margaret.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lady-glenconner-main-60ca_1571749513.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
