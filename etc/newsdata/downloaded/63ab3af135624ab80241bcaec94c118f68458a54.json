Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) responded to a woman at her town hall who proclaimed that we must \u201ceat the babies\u201d to save the world from climate change, and she urged everyone to \u201ctreat the situation compassionately.\u201d\n\nA clip emerged Thursday evening of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s town hall at the Queens Public Library, featuring a flustered woman who proclaimed that we need to \u201ceat the babies\u201d in order to save the planet from climate change.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to be here for much longer because of the climate crisis,\u201d the woman said. \u201cWe only have a few months left!\u201d\n\nThe woman told the socialist \u201cSquad\u201d member that she loves her support for the Green New Deal but lamented that it is \u201cnot getting rid of fossil fuel; it\u2019s not going to solve the problem fast enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Swedish professor [said] we can eat dead people, but that\u2019s not fast enough. So I think your next campaign slogan has to be this: \u2018We got to start eating babies! We don\u2019t have enough time! There is too much CO2,\u201d the woman proclaimed.\n\n\u201cAll of you \u2026 you are a pollutant, too much CO2,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe have to start now, please, you are so great.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy that you really are supporting New Green Deal, but it\u2019s not enough, you know. Even if we would bomb Russia, we still have too many people,\u201d she added. \u201cToo much pollution, so we have to get rid of the babies! That\u2019s a big problem. We need to eat the babies!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told the distressed woman.\n\n\u201cLuckily we have more than a few months. We do need to hit net zero in several years,\u201d she added.\n\nOcasio-Cortez also responded to the clip on Twitter, reprimanding right-wing individuals for \u201cmocking\u201d the woman. She also used the incident to plug Medicare for All.\n\n\u201cWe had a fabulous town hall tonight & I\u2019ll be highlighting some moments from it,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \u201cAt one point I was concerned there was a woman in crisis & want to ensure we treat the situation compassionately.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not mock or make a spectacle. &let\u2019s work on Medicare for All!\u201d she plugged.\n\n\u201cThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it\u2019s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez added. \u201cBe a decent human being and knock it off\u201d:\n\nThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it\u2019s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019\n\nIt remains unclear if the woman was a genuine Ocasio-Cortez supporter or someone spoofing the socialist lawmaker.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. reacted to the clip on Twitter:\n\nSeems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019", "description": "Rep.
