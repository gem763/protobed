I really enjoy watching them,' he added.\n\n\u2018I always think they will win, whoever they play. Whether it is a top of the table clash or a Champions league clash, I always fancy Liverpool as favourites now.\n\nThe midfielder was back at Anfield to play in a legends game against Rangers\n\n'The front three, in the form they are in, they are unplayable at times and Van Dijk has been a real big cog in the jigsaw, the keeper and the rest around them aren\u2019t bad.\n\n\u2018They are great to watch and it is great from a fans view to see them sit top of the league but I am sure Jurgen is thinking the same as me, take the next game as it comes, keep pushing and try and win the next one.\u2019\n\nAnd on his current Rangers side, Gerrard continued: 'We have had a setback in the Europa league against young boys in the last minute which was a blow and an old Firm defeat\n\n\u2018Aside from that defeat the boys have been outstanding. We are only in October and we have a long way to go. We need to keep pushing.'", "description": "Steven Gerrard admitted to missing the everyday joy of representing Liverpool as he returned to Anfield for a legends match against Rangers.", "authors": ["Will Griffee For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/15/19628294-0-image-a-99_1570891178837.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
