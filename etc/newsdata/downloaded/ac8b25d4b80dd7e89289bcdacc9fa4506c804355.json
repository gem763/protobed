I'm just sick of being f****d over.\"\n\nAnd in another image, a Grim Reaper with a bloodstained scythe points at you with the caption: \"Coming for you...\".\n\nBarrass sobbed in court as she pleaded guilty to murdering her two teenage sons at home in Sheffield last month.\n\nThe mum cried throughout the 20-minute hearing at Sheffield Crown Court and was separated from Machin, who showed no emotion, by three security guards.\n\nBarrass has been told she could be jailed for the rest of her life.\n\nJudge Jeremy Richardson QC told the pair they will be sentenced on November 12.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nJudge Jeremy Richardson QC told them: \"No words of mine can ever fully reflect the enormity of what you have both done.\n\n\"The crimes you have committed quite frankly speak for themselves. The murder of two children.\n\n\"The attempted murder of four children and the over-arching conspiracy to murder those children.\n\n\"I repeat, those crimes speak for themselves.\n\n\"I have little doubt that each of you will in due course be sentenced to several terms of life imprisonment.\n\n\"This may well be a case, but it's a matter for the judge, where a whole life order is imposed.\"\n\nNo details were given in court about what happened to the children inside the house in Sheffield on May 24 and May 25 this year.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police has never released the cause of the two boys' death and it was not given when an inquest was opened earlier this year.\n\nThe brief inquest hearing at Sheffield Coroners' Court on June 5 did hear that Blake and Tristan died just 12 minutes apart.\n\nTristan was pronounced dead at 9.14am and Blake died 12 minutes later.\n\nThe court heard that all of the surviving children are under the age of 13.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBrothers Blake and Tristan were found dead at a house in Sheffield on the morning of May 24.\n\nA serious case review is to be held into the deaths of the two boys.\n\nIn May, Councillor Jackie Drayton, Sheffield City Council's cabinet member for children and families, said she was \"devastated\" to hear of the deaths.\n\nShe said the review would be formally commissioned by the Safeguarding Children Board.\n\n\"All partners in the city will be coming together to understand, review and reflect on exactly what happened and why,\" she said.\n\nThe review's findings will be made public once it has concluded, she added.\n\nHundreds of mourners attended the funeral of the two teen brothers who were laid to rest together in one coffin last month.\n\nBlake and Tristan's shared coffin arrived to Grenoside Crematorium in Sheffield with an enormous cortege of 300 motorcycles and two Lamborghini cars.\n\nFriends and family say the brothers were both fanatical about fast cars and motorbikes, so local owners were asked to be part of the procession.\n\nAs the white coffin, which had the boys' names engraved on it, entered the crematorium the Ed Sheeran song Thinking Out Loud was played on loudspeakers.\n\nIt was revealed in May that Tristan appeared on a BBC programme with a yellow mohawk to raise money for a friend battling cancer.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nTristan Barrass, 13, spoke about his hairstyle in the TV show called Our School in 2017 and his efforts to support his school friend.\n\nTristan said his pal was \"dying of bone cancer\" so he decided to dye his hair yellow - his friend's favourite colour - as BBC cameras captured him laughing and joking with fellow pupils at his school.\n\nIn the BBC programme, Tristan says: \"My friend is dying of bone cancer, I asked if I could dye my hair yellow for him.\n\n\"His favourite colour is yellow.\"\n\nTristan said his hair \"makes me who I want to be\".\n\nHe added: \"With normal hair, you look like any other person.\"\n\nThe TV series showed pupils as they prepared to go from Year 6 to Year 7.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Sarah Barrass made the post in July last year and 10 month later, along with family member Brandon Machin, murdered her two teenage sons Tristan, 13, and Blake Barrass, 14", "authors": ["Andy Rudd", "Image", "Facebook", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16209920.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_THP_CHP_270519Slug_4457JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
