About 45% of them \u2014 some 445,000 kids \u2014 would still qualify for free meals. But most of the others \u2014 about 497,000 kids who currently get free meals \u2014 would have to start paying a reduced price of 40 cents for school lunch and 30 cents for breakfast, since they come from families with an annual income of between 130% and 185% of the federal poverty level.\n\nAnother 40,000 kids who currently get free meals would need to pay the full price because their family won't qualify for the program anymore.\n\nAccording to the USDA, the proposal could cut $90 million annually from the cost of its school lunch and breakfast programs. The agency noted that the number of children being affected by the proposal could be less because some schools offer free lunches to all students regardless of eligibility.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has said tightening access to SNAP would close a \"loophole\" that allows families receiving temporary assistance benefits to automatically get food stamps too.\n\nBut critics argue that the change will increase food insecurity among low-income families and add to states' administrative costs.", "description": "The proposal would tighten access to food stamps, and tens of thousands of children would lose automatic eligibility for free meals", "authors": ["Natacha Larnaud"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/30/319580d7-8838-44ee-bd7f-e76bf5bf0815/thumbnail/1200x630/609a848ad059e0645dc9d81a0ab317b2/brigaid-serving-up-lunch-in-school-cafeteria-promo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
