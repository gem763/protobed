Not only so your child can distinguish it from teammates\u2019 belongings, but also so parents can distinguish one child\u2019s baseball glove, soccer shorts or helmet from their other children\u2019s equipment. Labeling also makes it easier to put items away when there is more than one person in the house doing laundry. Sometimes this just requires using a Sharpie to write a name on a jersey or pair of shorts, but personalized labels, such as Mabel\u2019s Labels, are also great for sports bags, water bottles and the inside of shoes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccessible location\n\nPerhaps the most important organizing decision you\u2019ll make in terms of organizing sports equipment is where you\u2019ll store the items. Wherever you and your kids most often enter the house makes the most sense, but if there are no options near your front door (the hall closet can\u2019t accommodate coats, shoes and sports equipment), think about other options that have ample space where everything can be stored together. The garage is a fine option for balls, sticks, pads and other large (and often smelly) items that are brought home in between practices and games. A mudroom or a side hallway with hooks also works. Just make sure your kids know the floor by the front door is not an appropriate drop zone.\n\nA bag or bin for each sport\n\nAs with all organizing tasks, it\u2019s vital to have a specific place where items belong so everyone in the family knows where to store them. An easy way to do this is to assign each child a designated bag for each sport. If you use bags, they don\u2019t have to be fancy name-brand sports bags; a small tote or a pull-string bag will do. If you\u2019re using bins, it\u2019s better to use something that can be easily wiped clean instead of a basket or fabric bin. Either way, label the bags or bins clearly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt also may be worth designating a particular laundry bin for sports clothing so uniform components don\u2019t get lost or separated in other dirty clothes piles. One client has a labeled bin in her son\u2019s closet specifically for game uniforms. This way, those items are easy to find before a game, and her son knows not to wear those clothes to practices during the week.\n\nStorage solutions\n\nRegardless of where you\u2019re storing sports equipment, the goal should be to get everything off the floor and in a place where it\u2019s easy to put away. If your storage solutions aren\u2019t easy or conveniently located, you\u2019re starting at a disadvantage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for storage solutions, be strategic. Don\u2019t pick random products before you know where you plan to put them. And even though everyone is tired after a practice or game, try to get your kids into a routine of putting their equipment in the proper spots every time. After each season, cull through everything and pass along outgrown equipment to family or friends, or donate it. Only properly sized equipment and uniforms should be accessible.\n\nAnzia is a freelance writer and owner of Neatnik.
