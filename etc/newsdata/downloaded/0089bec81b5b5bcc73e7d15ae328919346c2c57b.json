The developer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Saturday in a tweet they said that Apple had \"many business considerations\" but had \"make thing(s) right.\"\n\nApple is the latest foreign company to catch heat in relation to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which have lasted four months.\n\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) and U.S. sports brand Vans also have become embroiled in controversies over the protests.\n\nThe piece on the website of the People's Daily said Apple did not have a sense of right and wrong, and ignored the truth.", "description": "In a commentary the newspaper did not mention the name of the location app, but it decried what it said was Apple's complicity in helping the protesters.", "authors": ["Arjun Kharpal"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106092894-1566532549657gettyimages-1163173740.jpeg?v=1567488156", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
