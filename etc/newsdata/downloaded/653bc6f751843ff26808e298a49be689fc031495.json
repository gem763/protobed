From left are members Miryo, JeA, Gain and Narsha. [MYSTIC STORIES]\n\nPrepare to be surprised when listening to Brown Eyed Girls\u2019 latest album. The group is back for the first time in four years with their renditions of 10 classic hits from the history of Korean pop music. All of the tracks on their full-length album \u201cRE_vive\u201d are remakes of songs from the past - something that fans didn\u2019t see coming - and turned out to be more difficult than expected.\u201cWith a new song, we get guide vocals,\u201d said member Gain. \u201cBut to have a complete song, it was really hard to reinterpret every part of that and make it ours. The recording was especially hard because we kept sounding similar to the original voices. We had to work really hard.\u201dThe task was no joke, especially with \u201cAbandoned\u201d - one of the two lead tracks, along with \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d Since the song\u2019s original singer Jung Jae-hyung has a very distinct voice, the challenge for members was to keep his voice out of their heads in the process.\u201cWe were dying along the way,\u201d said member JeA. \u201cIt was an immense pressure not just for us but also the members of the staff. We really didn\u2019t realize it would be this hard from the very beginning. But now that it\u2019s out, it\u2019s very fulfilling.\u201dMember Miryo added, \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about this for a long time, and we started working on it two years ago.\u201dIf for \u201cAbandoned\u201d the members had to pull out all of their vocal powers to lead a deep ballad track with minimal instruments, the music video for \u201cWonder Woman\u201d - originally sung by Cho Won-sun - arouses a visual shock that is perhaps even larger than the song itself.In the videos, the four members of Brown Eyed Girls are clad in black tuxedos and stand surrounded by drag performers clad in white wedding dresses - a reversal of traditional gender roles that is sure to shock some viewers.\u201cMany of the drag queens that are featured in the music video are doing so much, especially performances,\u201d said member Narsha. \u201cIt was really hard to coordinate with them, but many of them canceled their scheduled events and made time for us. Honestly, I think they are the main characters of the music video - we\u2019re there to support them.\u201d\u201cWe focused so much more than we have ever done in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cWe realized that we had to feel some sort of responsibility while making this album. We\u2019re not being cocky, but we do feel confident.\u201dBY YOON SO-YEON [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/28205511.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
