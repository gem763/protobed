Climate Action Summit to build on their pledges from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to cap the global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees.\n\nThe agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations, set a goal of limiting warming to \u201cwell below\u201d a rise of 2C above pre-industrial times while \u201cpursuing efforts\u201d for the tougher 1.5C goal.\n\nA rise of 2C is expected to wipe out more than 99 percent of coral reefs and melt most of the sea ice in the Arctic.\n\n\u201cBasically we are on track to reach at least 1.2- 1.3 degrees centigrade (above pre-industrial levels) over the next five years,\u201d said Omar Baddour, WMO senior scientific officer, in response to a Reuters question at a Geneva news conference.\n\n\u201cIt needs drastic actions,\u201d he added.\n\nThe comments came after the U.N. agency released a report on Sunday showing that the period from 2015 to 2019 was set to be the warmest five-year period on record, rising by 0.2 degrees Celsius over 2011-2015.\n\n\u201cNot only are these statistics alarming they dispel any false sense of security that maybe we will muddle through this,\u201d said Maxx Dilley, director of the climate prediction and adaptation division of the WMO, told journalists.\n\nPeople take part in protests ahead of the upcoming G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany July 2, 2017.
