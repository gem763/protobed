Symonds , a White House communications staff member, argued that there were \u201cmyths\u201d being spread by Democrats about the phone call, which had \u201ctriggered a media frenzy of false accusations.\u201d\n\nIt portrays the conversation between the two leaders as \u201centirely proper\u201d and the handling of a related whistle-blower complaint about the call as being \u201cabsolutely by the book.\u201d The email also made reference to the \u201cDeep State,\u201d a phrase that has fueled conspiracy theories of government bureaucrats working to undermine President Trump. Sharing such messaging guidance with allies is common among both parties in Washington.\n\nShortly after the memo went out, a follow-up message from Ms. Symonds\u2019s account stated that she would \u201clike to recall\u201d the previous email.
