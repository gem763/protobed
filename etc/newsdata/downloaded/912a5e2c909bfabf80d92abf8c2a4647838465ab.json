USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Alex Bregman\u2019s fire burns internally right now, or so it seems.\n\nThere is a World Series championship to be won, and Bregman performed grimly in its first three games and so he\u2019s chosen his words carefully, his energy contained, his focus unwavering.\n\nHis Houston Astros teammates tell a different story \u2013 that of a player seething from the disrespect of an intentional walk in Game 3 that, even more maddening, actually worked against a player that may well win the American League\u2019s Most Valuable Player award.\n\nAnd so when he came to bat in the seventh inning of Saturday night\u2019s Game 4 at Nationals Park, and the Houston Astros\u2019 three-run lead endangered by a wobbly bullpen, the sting of that diss and his own sick performance framed his bases-loaded at-bat against reliever Fernando Rodney.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those moments where you think that he\u2019s going to go off,\u201d says outfielder Josh Reddick. \u201cBecause he\u2019d probably be the most mad guy that would get in that situation to get intentionally walked to him.\n\n\u201cReally, you\u2019re walking that guy to get to me? Hell with that. I think he\u2019s the guy who really lives for those moments.\u201d\n\nAlex Bregman celebrates his grand slam in the seventh inning of Game 4. (Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAnd the Washington Nationals may perish for daring to tick him off.\n\nBregman erased the shame of the first three games with one gorgeous swing, staying on a Rodney two-seam fastball and sending the ball high into the seats down the left field line. His ninth career postseason home run sailed right over the head of one giddy Astros fan and into a sea of glum fans clad in red, head to toe.\n\nIt would be the final word in the Astros\u2019 8-1 victory that squared this World Series at two games apiece, ensuring a Game 6 on Tuesday in Houston and inspiring a world of possibilities for an Astros club that dared lose the first two games at home.\n\nIf ever there was a series-shifting moment, this was it. And if ever there was a guy to deliver it, well\u2026\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s born for this, born for these big moments,\u201d shortstop Carlos Correa said of Bregman, who also delivered the most important hit of the Astros\u2019 seven-game triumph in the 2017 Series, a 10th-inning, Game 5 walk-off single.\n\n\u201cYou can contain him for a couple games, but not for a whole series. The man is unbelievable. He\u2019s one of the best hitters in the game, and you guys saw it tonight.\u201d\n\nEspecially when an opponent dares awaken a sleeping giant.\n\nNATIONALS: Clutch hitting woes continue in Game 4 loses\n\nDECISION: Why didn't Nationals use Hudson or Doolittle?\n\nIn Friday\u2019s Game 3, the Astros were nursing a 4-1 lead when Rodney encountered Michael Brantley with first base open. At that point, Bregman was in a 4-for-29 rut dating to the American League Championship Series, and 1 for 11 in this Series.\n\nSo Rodney walked Brantley, loading the bases \u2013 and retired Bregman on a grounder to short.\n\nA lineout in the ninth pushed his valley to 4 for 31 and 1 for 13. It also set off an alarm among his teammates.\n\n\u201cThat walk they issued to Michael to pitch to him, that set him on fire,\u201d says Correa. \u201cYou do that to A-Breg, he\u2019s going to come back the next day and be A-Breg.\n\n\u201cAfter that walk I said, \u2018Oh no, you don\u2019t do that to him.\u2019\u201d\n\nApparently not.\n\nCorrea felt so strongly about it that after Game 3, he forecast that Bregman would \u201cgo off\u201d in Game 4, in part because of the disrespect, in part because, well, he\u2019s an excellent baseball player.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Bregman to find his playoff level.\n\nHe drove in the Astros\u2019 first run with an RBI single off Nationals starter Patrick Corbin, which preceded a Yuli Gurriel infield single that gave Houston a 2-0 lead.\n\nIt was 4-1 into the seventh, but bad vibes were afoot for the Astros. Manager A.J. Hinch\u2019s decision to yank starter Jose Urquidy after five shutout innings looked shaky after reliever Josh James walked a pair and gave up a run in the seventh, forcing top reliever Will Harris to bail him out.\n\nThe Nationals returned the favor in the seventh, when Tanner Rainey walked a pair of batters and was replaced by Rodney, who this time had no choice but face Bregman with the bases loaded. Rodney failed to sneak his 0-1 fastball by Bregman, who clubbed it to left.\n\nHe watched it sail as he walked down the line, more to ascertain whether it would stay fair than revel in his moment. At the dugout rail, aces Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole erupted as the ball cleared the fence.\n\nAlex Bregman grand slam pic.twitter.com/g6uYItkGaC \u2014 USA TODAY MLB (@usatodaymlb) October 27, 2019\n\nBregman? He turned and jogged around the bases, eventually bashing arms with teammates at home plate but not at all circling the bases in a manner that might leap out in a Ken Burns documentary decades from now.\n\nAfterward, he talked of feeling \u201cpretty fired up\u201d about the grand slam, moreso for helping the team win than avenging any indignities. Just passing the torch, he said. Just \u201cfortunate enough to put a good swing on it,\u201d he insisted.\n\nThe low tones and stoic expression were 180 degrees from his wink-and-a-smirk persona he so often exudes, eyes bright, knowing a secret he may or may not let you in on.\n\nOn this night, he grinned a bit when asked if he agreed with Correa\u2019s assessment the Astros \u2013 and their third baseman - had their swagger back.\n\n\u201cI just think we're better when we have fun, and we had fun the last two days. And winning is fun and playing well is fun,\u201d he said, stopping just shy of insisting they\u2019re taking it one game at a time.\n\nUh-huh.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you deep down in his mind, he was mad that they did that to him,\u201d says Reddick. \u201cSo maybe it was carried over to tonight.\n\n\u201cWho knows with him. I wish that I could run through his brain in a day. There\u2019s all kinds of crazy things that come out.\u201d\n\nSays Correa: \u201cThat\u2019s what you get. Grand slam. Cool.\u201d", "description": "Houston's MVP candidate has struggled in the postseason, but delivered a grand slam in the Astor's Game 4 win at Nationals Park.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
