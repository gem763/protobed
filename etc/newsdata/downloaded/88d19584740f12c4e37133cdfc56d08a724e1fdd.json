A study last year showed Novo's tablet was superior to Januvia in demonstrating reductions in both long-term blood sugar level and weight.\n\n\"We have a very strong position if you look at the leading tablet treatments in the market,\" Thomsen said.\n\nNovo hopes to convince doctors that Rybelsus, which brokerage Pareto estimates will have sales of at least 36.6 billion Danish crowns ($5.4 billion) in 2026, provides a new weapon to tackle diabetes earlier, and highly effectively.\n\nThomsen said the U.S. approval was a triumph of perseverance. \"We were laughed at when we told our peers about it. They thought we had eaten or smoked something weird,\" he said of the early plans for the drug.\n\nThe name Rybelsus was picked because of its similarity to the word rebellious. \"There is a revolt against why biological drugs should always be treated through injections,\" said Thomsen.", "description": "Novo Nordisk targets bigger slice of diabetes market with new tablet", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8M0UN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
