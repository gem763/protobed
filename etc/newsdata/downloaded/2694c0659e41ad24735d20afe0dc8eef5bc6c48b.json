I knew I was in trouble. I rang Thommo. He came down and was like, \"Flippin' heck, look at you\". My eyes were popping out. He went to reception and paid for a doctor to come to the hotel,\" Cottee told the Mail.\n\nAn ambulance was immediately called and Cottee underwent an MRI scan and tests at West Middlesex Hospital, that showed a brain haemorrhage.\n\nIt had been suggested that he would require a brain operation but doctors determined surgery was not necessary.\n\n\"I was so lucky. It could have caused a stroke, an aneurysm, I could have dropped dead. It was a warning. I'd been doing too much,\" Cottee added.\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nThe former striker returned to work with Sky earlier this season and immediately saw Anfield legend Thompson.\n\nHe said \"The first person I saw was Thommo, I gave him the biggest cuddle. It was an emotional moment - and I never thought I'd say that after hugging Phil Thompson! I will forever be thankful to him, he was there when I needed him.\n\n\"If I'd stayed in bed all day and tried to ride through it, without that doctor coming, who knows what would have happened.\"", "description": "Former West Ham and Everton striker Tony Cottee admits he could have died in the summer were it not for Sky Sports colleague Phil Thompson", "authors": ["Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Instagram Tony_Cottee", "Getty Images Europe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574838.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Tony-Cottee-and-Phil-Thompson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
