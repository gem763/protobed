Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday morning, a redacted version of the whistle-blower report at the heart of Democrats\u2019 efforts to impeach President Trump was released to the public. The complaint details Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to solicit the help of Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Democratic 2020 candidate Joe Biden, and the White House\u2019s effort to cover up Trump\u2019s request. Here are the highlights:\n\nTrump\u2019s phone call was damning\n\nThe letter details a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, the details of which have been previously reported. In that call, the letter says, Trump pressured Zelensky to \u201cinitiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden,\u201d and asked Zelensky to try to \u201cassist in purportedly uncovering that allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine\u201d \u2013 one of the president\u2019s pet conspiracy theories. Trump requested that Zelensky speak with his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as well as Attorney General William Barr about those matters.\n\nThe Trump administration allegedly tried to bury the transcript of the call\n\nThe whistle-blower writes that in the days after the phone call, White House officials said they were instructed to \u201cremove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization, and distribution to Cabinet-level officials.\u201d The transcript was instead loaded into a different system typically used to store classified information, which one White House official, according to the complaint, described as an abuse of the system, since the call did not contain any sensitive national-security information.\n\nRudy Giuliani\u2019s role drew internal criticism\n\nThe complaint also lays out in detail Giuliani\u2019s long-running efforts to try to get Ukraine\u2019s government to aggressively investigate Biden \u2014 efforts Giuliani has not been shy about divulging.\n\nBut the whistle-blower writes that \u201cstarting in mid-May, I heard from multiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth.\u201d\n\nThe complaint points the finger at Attorney General William Barr\n\nOn the first page of the complaint, the whistle-blower writes that Giuliani is \u201ca central figure\u201d in the effort to tarnish Biden ahead of the 2020 election, but \u201cAttorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.\u201d Barr has denied any involvement in the matter, and the complaint does not lay out any new information about his role in it. But his decision not to recuse himself from the Ukraine probe altogether, which has already drawn fierce Democratic criticism, is likely to draw even more scrutiny now.\n\nMore than six officials informed the whistle-blower of the misconduct\n\n\u201cOver the past four months, more than half a dozen U.S. officials have informed of various facts related to this effort,\u201d the letter states.\n\n\u201cI was not a direct witness to most of the events described,\u201d it goes on. \u201cHowever, I found my colleagues\u2019 accounts of these events to be credible because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another.\u201d These witnesses, the whistleblower says, were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the Ukraine phone call because they had \u201cwitnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.\u201d\n\nRepublicans will likely call into question the accuracy of the letter, given the second-hand information contained therein. But the fact that there are multiple other witnesses to the president\u2019s alleged malfeasance makes corroboration more likely.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
