Being rich inevitably paints him into a corner. It doesn\u2019t mean that he rules for the rich, but in a hungry Argentina that\u2019s a disadvantage because there are things he can only see if he is told about them,\u201d said Pablo Knopoff, a friend and political pollster.\n\n\u201cMacri didn\u2019t go to a public school nor did he ever use the public health service, nor ever have to use public transport. He\u2019s a strange politician in that regard, a guy who at 17 wasn\u2019t going around putting up posters on the streets,\u201d said Knopoff.\n\n\u2013 Fortune, and fame \u2013\n\nThe twice-divorced father of four rose to fame as the president of Argentina\u2019s most popular football club, Boca Juniors.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be Boca\u2019s number nine\u201d striker, he once said.\n\nInstead, he led in the boardroom during the team\u2019s most successful period, seeing it win 17 titles.\n\nThat powerful position catapulted him into politics. He founded his Republican Proposal alliance, known as PRO, in 2005.\n\nElected mayor of Buenos Aires in 2007, Macri led a movement called \u201cLet\u2019s Change\u201d vowing to roll back policies that Kirchner says help the working class but business leaders say wrecked economic growth.\n\n\u2013 Life of privilege, drama \u2013\n\nMacri was born in Tandil, a city in an eastern agricultural region, and was educated at the elite Cardinal Newman College in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe son of a rich businessman, he previously managed the family firm.\n\nHe is married to model and fashion entrepreneur Juliana Awada, with whom he has an eight-year-old daughter. He has three adult children from the first of his three marriages.\n\nHis life has been marked by dramas and scandals.\n\nIn 1991, he was kidnapped and freed two weeks later after his family paid a $6 million ransom.\n\nHe said of the episode that he needed psychoanalysis for many years afterwards.\n\nHe was cleared of smuggling charges in the 1990s and overcame accusations of links to groups of Boca football hooligans.\n\nMore recently he was swept up in the Panama Papers controversy over offshore assets, saying he would repatriate more than a $1 million from his account in the Bahamas.\n\nThe leak of millions of documents in 2016 from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca showed he was on the boards of two offshore companies linked to his wealthy business magnate father.\n\n\u201cIn the past, (Macri) was just right-wing and proud of it,\u201d sociologist Federico Gonzalez told AFP.\n\n\u201cNow he is like Buddha. He went out of his palace and discovered misery and sickness.\u201d", "description": "Buenos Aires (AFP) \u2013 Critics of Mauricio Macri say he has floated above the maelstrom of Argentina\u2019s economic crisis during his four-year", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/194171_argentina-president-mauricio-macri-waves-supporters-closing-rally-his-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
