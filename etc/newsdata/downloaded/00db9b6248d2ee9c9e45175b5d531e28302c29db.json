Please vote for the British tree.'\n\nThe tree has a colourful history - it is mentioned in the Domesday Book and local legend tells of a medieval court, known as a Hundred Court, that met under its branches as local officials had no courthouse.\n\nThe Allerton Oak was first mentioned in William the Conqueror's Domesday Book of 1086. The local court used to meet under its branches in medieval times as they had no courthouse\n\nThe Colchester Castle Sycamore in Essex, which came in second place, was planted by the mayor's daughter to commemorate the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, according to local lore\n\nLiverpool City Council is working in partnership with the Mersey Forest to preserve the Allerton Oak.\n\nThe council has already invested around \u00a370,000 this year, but the value of the tree is 'conservatively estimated' at more than \u00a3500,000.\n\nAdam Cormack, Woodland Trust head of campaigning, said: 'The Allerton Oak is a spectacular example of a city tree.\n\n'Trees are an important part of the urban landscape helping to make our towns and cities better places to live. We are keen to increase understanding of their value and promote their protection.\n\n'We are currently working with partners to help increase tree cover in the city and make Liverpool a greener place to live.'", "description": "The 1000-year-old Allerton Oak in Calderstones Park, Liverpool, will represent the UK in the European Tree of the Year contest which begins in February.", "authors": ["Colin Fernadez For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/01/20062710-0-image-a-69_1571790384755.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
