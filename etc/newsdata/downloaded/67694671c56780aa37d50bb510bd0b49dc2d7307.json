All of which Jamie Vardy\u2019s wife has vehemently denied.\n\nNow Harry has added his two cents, insisting he only cares about reading up on what Wayne and Jamie are up to, believing the two WAGs were merely after publicity.\n\nHe does love to tell it how it is.\n\n\u2018They seem to be getting plenty of publicity. I suppose that\u2019s what they like, really,\u2019 Harry told Mirror Online this week.\n\nIt\u2019s the showbiz clash of the year (Picture: Getty/ITV/Rex)\n\n\u2018When I was in football, it was only the footballers we used to read about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We played football and it was the footballers.\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018We didn\u2019t have WAGs or whatever they\u2019re called now. They weren\u2019t around in my day.\u2019\n\nInsisting he cares not for reading about the lives of the footballers\u2019 wives over their on-field prowess, Harry added: \u2018I\u2019m only interested in reading about Jamie Vardy or Wayne Rooney.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not interested in what their wives are doing, to be truthful.\u2019\n\nColeen shared a statement to social media\n\nRebekah was on holiday with her family in Dubai when Coleen made her accusations last Wednesday, writing on Instagram that she had suspected the WAG of providing stories and so set up an elaborate sting to expose Rebekah.\n\nLast week 33-year-old Coleen took to social media as she wrote: \u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\nRebekah denied selling stories in a post on Twitter (Picture: Twitter)\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColeen continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nMum-of-four Coleen has yet to post the alleged screenshots as Rebekah fired back in her own statement: \u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this. I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reality star continued: \u2018I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s since been claimed Rebekah had hired forensic investigators to look at her Instagram for any hacks.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
