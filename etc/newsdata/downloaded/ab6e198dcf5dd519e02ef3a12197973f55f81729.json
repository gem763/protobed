The rallies were sparked by the Lebanese government\u2019s announcement of a planned daily tax on the use of WhatsApp, Skype and other voice-over-internet services. For many Lebanese struggling to makes end meet, it was the final straw. While the government quickly dropped the tax, the protests have mushroomed into a wider call for wholesale changes to Lebanon\u2019s sectarian system of government, one dominated by long-standing political dynasties that many people accuse of unchecked corruption.\n\n\n\nAmid protests in major cities including Beirut, Tripoli and Tyre, Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri announced on Monday that the cabinet had approved a string of reforms. Salaries of senior politicians will be cut in half, an anti-corruption body will be established, and no new taxes will be created in the 2020 budget \u2013 a major change to the 2019 budget which contained several levies that drained the wallets of millions of Lebanese struggling to get by.\n\n\n\nBut for the protesters, the cabinet-approved reforms are not enough and they are continuing to call for the government\u2019s resignation and for fresh elections to be held. But in a highly constrained political system that reserves offices by sect, is real political change for the benefit of ordinary people even possible? Join the conversation on Thursday.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\n'The people are one': Lebanese unite against political elite \u2013 Al Jazeera\n\nYears after Taif, Lebanese call for end to sectarian politics \u2013 Al Jazeera\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?
