USA TODAY\n\nStory Highlights Trump gets to celebrate the passage of criminal justice reform\n\nTrump could overshadow a visit by Democratic candidates\n\nTrump might tout his economic successes to a minority audience\n\nHighlight justice reform as a sign of concern for issues that disproportionately affect black voters\n\nPresident Donald Trump's visit to Benedict College in Columbia, S.C., Friday has raised questions about his motivation for entering the heart of a historically black school, where supporters among the demographic are likely to be few.\n\nWhat is the political angle? What is there to gain, or potentially, to lose? Both for Trump and the Democratic presidential challengers who will all participate in the weekend's \"Second Step Presidential Justice Forum.\"\n\nThe forum, held on the 150-year-old college's campus in the heart of Columbia, will focus on the issue of criminal justice reform. Nine of the highest-profile Democratic candidates will attend on Saturday.\n\nBut it will be Trump who has the microphone all to himself on Friday, and the White House says he will address the next step in his criminal justice reform effort, the First Step Act.\n\nTrump: Trump slammed by lawmakers after he called impeachment inquiry a 'lynching'\n\nThe new law increased funding for job skill training and expanded pre-release custody qualifications for low-risk inmates, allowing more prisoners of lesser offenses to go free.\n\nIt's a law that Trump has embraced as a victory, and Furman University political science professor Danielle Vinson said the appearance at Benedict is an opportunity to celebrate.\n\n\"It\u2019s an opportunity for Trump to tout one of his accomplishments, the passage of criminal justice reform last year,\" Vinson said. \"Trump likes to celebrate his victories, and the opportunity to do it in a state where he\u2019s popular but in a venue that many will see as Democratic turf is icing on the cake.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds up an executive order to bolster historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) after signing it in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 28, 2017.

Cory Booker; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Kamala Harris; Sen. Bernie Sanders; Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden will speak as part of the forum on Saturday.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard will participate on Sunday.\n\nTrump will be long gone by then.\n\nCandace Owens: Candace Owens\u2019 rapid rise defending two of America\u2019s most complicated men: Trump and Kanye\n\nChip Felkel, a Greenville-based GOP strategist who has been critical of Trump, said he believes the visit is an opportunity to \"stick it in the eye of Democratic candidates,\" who will be overshadowed.\n\n\"It's an odd visit,\" Felkel said. \"He's asking for controversy by doing so, but he thrives on it.\"\n\nTrump enjoys overwhelming support among South Carolina Republican voters, so much so that state party leaders canceled the 2020 primary, and Felkel said there's not much more to gain politically.\n\n\"I can't see where he gets a whole lot out of it that he doesn't already have,\" Felkel said.\n\nHowever, Clemson University political science professor David Woodard said Trump might have an opportunity to send a broader message beyond South Carolina voters to the nation if he focuses on his argument that the strong economy has benefited minorities more than ever.\n\n\"I'm sure that's the gist of his message,\" Woodard said. \u201cIf Republicans could break some of the stranglehold that Democrats have on the black vote, maybe the way to do it is to show the opportunity in free markets.\u201d\n\nFrom 2018: Black college presidents push for the \"next step\" after Capitol Hill conference\n\nWoodard said he's not surprised at the visit.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sort of fearless to walk in the lions,\" he said. \"I think he\u2019s comfortable doing that in states he knows he\u2019s going to win. He\u2019ll probably be more guarded in states that are more contested. I\u2019m not surprised he\u2019s coming to a base state.\"\n\nThe visit is likely more than a victory lap on an issue, said Robert Oldendick, a University of South Carolina political science professor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a matter of jumping into a place he\u2019s not wanted,\" Oldendick said.\n\nThe visit could serve as an effort not to gain black voters, but instead to affect their turnout, which Oldendick said was a factor in Trump's victory in 2016 when black voters didn't show up to polls in the same numbers as for former President Barack Obama's two elections.\n\nBenedict College pictured Monday, Oct. 21, 2019.

(Photo: Zoe Nicholson/Staff)\n\nTrump will highlight justice reform as a sign of his concern for issues that disproportionately affect black voters, he said.\n\n\u201cHe could be doing it more to kind of tamp down the enthusiasm African-Americans might have for the Democratic candidates,\u2019 Oldendick said. \u201cThis is one of the achievements that he can point to that resonates popularly in the black community.\u201d\n\nLive Elijah Cummings funeral coverage: Barack Obama, Clintons to speak at Baltimore funeral\n\nThe appearance offers Democrats an opportunity to attack Trump, though that might only be effective depending on what comments the president makes, Oldendick said.\n\nThe forum format on a particular subject limits their ability to differentiate themselves because there are so many competing to be heard, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic candidates have the same problem with this that they do in the debates,\u201d he said. \"For the most part, they\u2019re going to all pose very similar elements in terms of criminal justice reform.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats will have to be mindful of their purpose in attending in the first place, before the president announced his appearance, Vinson said. Whether the president goes \"off-script\" will determine the level of national attention, she said.\n\n\"The trick for all the Democrats will be finding a way to communicate their message and contrast themselves with Trump without getting lost in Trump. They don\u2019t want to just respond to him. They have to have their own message and respect the audience and the purpose of the event by addressing criminal justice reform.\"\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter @cericconnor\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/25/president-donald-trump-benedict-college-hbcu-columbia-sc-stick-democrats-deeper-political-strategy/2453531001/", "description": "President Donald Trump will visit an HBCU for the first time, entering the home turf of Democratic candidates at Benedict College in South Carolina.", "authors": ["Eric Connor", "Published A.M.
