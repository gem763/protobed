It\u2019s just about containing it and it's just, channeling it in the right areas.'\n\nSelena says she believes that 'love exists' and doesn't 'want to be jaded or bitter from anything.'\n\n'And I\u2019m happy waiting for that for however long it takes because we\u2019re going to be doing this forever.\u201d", "description": "She had to lose him to love herself.\u00a0While on the Zach Sang Show, Selena Gomez spoke on her status as a single woman, and described the kind of love she hopes to find in the future.", "authors": ["Brittany Valadez For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/03/20233314-0-image-a-12_1572146014130.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
