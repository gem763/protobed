The group used a GoFundMe account to raise the money, and have already exceeded what they hoped to raise.\n\n\u1f3c Toronto Raptors fans plan to stand with Hong Kong at NBA opening game. #HongKongProtests #AntiELAB #FreeHongKong https://t.co/6giplH6NaB pic.twitter.com/C1f8R2f94N \u2014 Hong Kong World City \u1f59\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude37\u2614\ufe0f (@HKWORLDCITY) October 14, 2019\n\n\u201cAs you may know by now, China is trying to censor the entire NBA because Houston Rockets\u2019 General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted a \u2018Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong\u2019 photo to support Hong Kong,\u201d the GoFundMe reads.\n\n\u201cIt was a productive Tuesday after the long weekend, and we have finalized the quantity of T Shirt production! We are able to make 7,000 T shirts, which is 2,000 more than our original target! We will cover 35% instead of 25% of the audience! That\u2019s 1/3 of the arena!\u201d\n\nThe GoFundMe page was created by the Toronto HongKongers Action Group. The group\u2019s organizer, Mimi Lee, sees the moment as an opportunity to open a new front against Chinese oppression\n\n\u201cCanada is actually another battleground to fight against China,\u201d Lee wrote on the GoFundMe page.\n\n\u201cWe may have a new government by the time this NBA match happens. Showing the Canadian government how much we stand with Hong Kong will definitely set a tone on the China policy for the new administration.\u201d\n\nThe next question becomes the reaction of the Raptors and the NBA. The Raptors, are in no way involved in the giveaway. Most stadiums have a policy against political signage or messaging in their arenas. A fact which was driven home over a week ago, when fans in Washington, DC, and Philadelphia, either had their pro-Hong Kong signage confiscated, or were asked to leave the arena.\n\nHowever, those were only a handful of demonstrators. If the Toronto HongKongers Action Group, is able to outfit one-third of the arena in pro-Hong Kong shirts, that would pose a much larger problem for stadium staff and security. Not to mention the PR disaster which would result from the footage of thousands of fans protesting for democracy, being forced out of an NBA arena.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "LeBron James may be done talking about the NBA-China controversy, but Toronto Raptors fans apparently have a lot more to say.", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/nba-basketball-in-hong-kong-640x480-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
