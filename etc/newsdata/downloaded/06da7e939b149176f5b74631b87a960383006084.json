Franco's legacy inspires love and loathing", "language": "en", "text": "The basilica at The Valley of Fallen in San Lorenzo del Escorial near Madrid where Franco is currently buried\n\nA dark and painful part of Spain's history will be brought back under the spotlight Thursday when the remains of Francisco Franco are exhumed from a landmark basilica in the hills near Madrid.\n\nThe delicate operation to move his remains to a more discreet resting place will take place on Thursday morning, despite a long-running legal battle by the late dictator's family.\n\nBut it threatens to open barely-healed wounds in a nation riven with contradictions -- where more than 100,000 people are still listed missing following the 1936-39 Civil War and its aftermath, yet where villages bear names in honour of the dictator who ruled until his death in 1975.\n\n\"Obviously, there are wounds which remain raw given you have more than 100,000 people still lying in ditches and mass graves,\" said Alejandro Quiroga, a historian at Britain's Newcastle University.\n\nThe figures, he said, make Spain the country with the second-largest number of 'disappeared', after Cambodia.\n\nAnd 44 years on, the single biggest symbol of the war and the decades of dictatorship is the Valley of the Fallen, a vast temple-like complex some 50 kilometres (30 miles) northwest of Madrid, where Franco is buried.\n\nThe very fact that such a monument exists makes Spain the \"great anomaly of western Europe\" with no such parallel in any other European state that survived a totalitarian leader, be it Germany, Italy or Portugal, says Julian Casanova, professor of modern history at Zaragoza University.\n\nTopped by a 150-metre (500-feet) cross, the hillside basilica has attracted both tourists and rightwing sympathisers, with many on the left repulsed by the memorial, comparing it to a monument glorifying Hitler.\n\nAnd for that reason, the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has insisted on Franco's remains being removed, saying Spain should not \"continue to glorify\" the dictator.\n\nBuilt by General Franco's regime between 1941 and 1959 -- in part by the forced labour of some 20,000 political prisoners -- the site contains the remains of more than 33,000 dead from both sides of the civil war.\n\nBut it has long been a draw for those nostalgic for the Franco era, who go there to hold masses in his honour and celebrate his memory.\n\nHistorians agree that removing Franco's remains from the Valley of the Fallen would be a \"step\" towards normalisation for Spain, a country which still has villages named \"Caudillo\" in honour of the dictator, and streets recalling senior figures within the Franco's regime.\n\n- Law of historical memory -\n\nBut where do these contradictions come from?\n\nFirstly, unlike other figures like Hitler or Mussolini, Franco survived World War II and did not drag Spain into the conflict, dying three decades later while still in power.\n\nOn his death, the political leaders agreed on a transition to democracy which \"maintained the political, social and economic elites that existed under Franco.. and implicitly maintained the idea that the Franquist past would not be the basis for political confrontation,\" explained Quiroga.\n\nAnd this allowed \"the senior administrators of the state and the judiciary to maintain a very conservative profile for a large part of the democracy,\" explained Marc Gil, a historian at Catalonia's Open University.\n\nBut in 2007 the Spanish parliament, under a Socialist government, approved the \"historical memory\" law which was aimed at giving greater recognition to victims on both sides of the civil war, which was triggered by Franco's rebellion against an elected Republican government.\n\nIt involves the removal of all symbols honouring Franco and requires the state to collaborate in the search for and exhumation of the mass graves of those who disappeared.\n\nBut its implementation has been blocked by the right, leaving those associations dedicated to tracking down the disappeared to pursue their thankless task \"entirely alone\", said Gil.\n\n- Persistent divisions -\n\nReflecting on recent history has also been hampered by political divisions, with the left lobbying for reparations for those who lost the war and were subjected to reprisals, but the right accusing them of wanting to reopen grievances that remain firmly in the past.\n\nEarlier this week, Pablo Casado, who heads the rightwing opposition People's Party, which was founded by former Franco ministers, said he would not waste \"even one minute talking about what happened in Spain 50 years ago.\n\nStory continues", "description": "A dark and painful part of Spain's history will be
