More recently, it added new verification requirements for ads on its platform about social issues, elections, and politics in the run-up to the 2020 US election.\n\nBut the report underscores how, despite the efforts by Facebook and other social media firms, social media manipulation is on the rise and becoming ever-more sophisticated. It is now a \"ubiquitous and pervasive part of the digital information ecosystem,\" the report said.\n\n\"Evidence of organized social media manipulation campaigns which have taken place in 70 countries, up from 48 countries in 2018 and 28 countries in 2017. In each country, there is at least one political party or government agency using social media to shape public attitudes domestically,\" it added.\n\nIn an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Facebook told Business Insider that protecting against harm and helping show people accurate information is a \"major priority\" for the company.\n\n\"We've developed smarter tools, greater transparency, and stronger partnerships to better identify emerging threats, stop bad actors, and reduce the spread of misinformation on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. We also know that this work is never finished and we can't do this alone. That's why we are working with policymakers, academics, and outside experts to make sure we continue to improve,\" he said.", "description": "Researchers say that Facebook's sheer size and the structure of the platform makes it more vulnerable.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8de56c2e22af6fbd79e8d6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
