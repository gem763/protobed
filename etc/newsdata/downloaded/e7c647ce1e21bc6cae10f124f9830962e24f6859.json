The 21-year-old Fultz has been plagued by shooting woes and injuries during his NBA career, but that didn\u2019t stop the Magic from releasing a Fultz hype video Wednesday.\n\nThe video features plenty of shots of Fultz running, working out and, yes, taking jump shots. How does Fultz look? You can be the judge of that.\n\nIn case you were wondering what Markelle's been up to... pic.twitter.com/3RE39oLN51 \u2014 Orlando Magic (@OrlandoMagic) September 25, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt\u2019s tough to take away any definitive conclusions from a highly edited, slowed-down video. The few clips in there that show Fultz\u2019s jump shot seem promising. At the very least, his shot looks a lot better than some of the videos that emerged when Fultz was with the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nWhile Fultz has yet to play a game for the Magic, all the news surrounding his progress has remained positive. On top of the hype video, the Magic also picked up Fultz\u2019s $12 million option in September, another sign that the team expects him to contribute.\n\nAfter Fultz averaged just 7.7 points and 3.4 assists with the 76ers, the Magic could have ignored or downplayed Fultz\u2019s expectations heading into Year 3. Instead, the team is calling attention to the progress Fultz has made, providing hope that the 2017 draft\u2019s No. 1 pick has finally turned a corner.\n\nThe Magic want people to know Markelle Fultz looks good again.
