It's moved to, I think, an incredibly demanding set of attributes. My view is that it's unrealistic. To ask someone to be able to demonstrate all those things is a very big ask,\" Professor Whitwell said, suggesting that employers may be \"putting too much emphasis\" on the role of education.\n\nNevertheless, Sydney University is focused on helping students to develop a broad range of skills, by providing opportunities to study overseas, undertake internships and volunteering activities.\n\nStudents from the undergraduate level are also encouraged to think about geopolitics and society's megatrends, such as the ageing population, climate change and the rise of so-called lifestyle diseases.\n\nMBA students form teams to solve real problems facing companies that are in a partnership with the university and EMBA students study modules offshore to encourage a global mindset.\n\n\"Everything I have heard over many years of being in this game would suggest that Australians aren't as embracing of trying to do business in the region as they should be,\" Professor Whitwell said, arguing that there were opportunities for Australia to export more services, such as insurance and healthcare.\n\nThe University of Sydney's EMBA program jumped two places from 2017, when it was ranked behind QUT Graduate School of Business and Melbourne Business School. The full ranking will be published in BOSS on Friday.\n\nSydney University launched its Global EMBA in 2010. The part-time MBA - which was entered into the BOSS survey - was launched in 2013, while the full-time MBA program was launched in the second semester of 2018.\n\nProfessor Whitwell said predictions that MBA courses would gradually disappear were overly pessimistic, but he did say he expected most of the growth would be in part-time, rather than full-time courses.\n\nHe said the margins on MBA and EMBA programs for the university were lower than for \"pre-experience\" masters programs, such as Masters of Commerce, because class sizes were small and students expected higher levels of career services.", "description": "Employers have unrealistic expectations about the skills they demand of university business graduates, warns the University of Sydney Business School, which secured top spot in the biennial BOSS ranking.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1996%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d9e7c092e99cf21c7e7fe7e12f75901e6e8e0662", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
