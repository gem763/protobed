And the action at the heart of the impeachment question is a blatant attempt by the president to use his office to improperly interfere with the next election.\n\nHow then can you argue that the judgment for improper election interference should be the very election that the perpetrator was interfering with? This makes no sense. It is akin to the Tour de France saying that the verdict on Lance Armstrong\u2019s doping should be whether or not he still wins the bike race he was just caught cheating in.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tim Miller", "Thebulwark.Com One-Big-Reason-Bad-But-Not-Impeachable-Is-Wrong"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
