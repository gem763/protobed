Mitt Romney, R-Utah, takes questions from reporters as he arrives for votes on pending nominations, at the Capitol in Washington. Romney\u2019s ratcheted-up rhetoric on President Donald Trump is again raising hopes among Trump detractors that the senator could play a key role in the unfolding impeachment saga, though the historic shifts in their relationship mean Romney\u2019s next move is an open question. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 In the hours after President Donald Trump called on China to investigate his political foe \u2014 plowing through another political guardrail \u2014 Democrats and Trump critics looked for signs that his party would slap him back. Seeking foreign help in an election is illegal. Who would stand up and say so?\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Mitt Romney stepped in.\n\n\"By all appearances, the president's brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,\" he tweeted.\n\nRomney's delayed criticism seemed to capture the senator's continued discomfort with the role of chief Trump critic, and a possible reluctance to restart the kind of back-and-forth that revved up on Saturday as Trump took to Twitter. The president unleashed a personal attack on Romney, calling him \"pompous,\" while defending his conversations with Ukraine and China as appropriate.\n\nFacing an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, Trump raised the specter of impeachment against Romney in a Saturday afternoon tweet, though the Constitution doesn't call for that as a way of removing a member of Congress.\n\n\"I'm hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake,\" Trump tweeted without citing his sources. \"I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats! #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY\".\n\nThe mild-mannered, failed-presidential-candidate-turned-senator has shown he feels compelled to speak out against Trump at key moments. But he doesn't appear quick to the draw. While Trump detractors are looking to Romney to play a key role in rallying GOP opposition to the president in the unfolding impeachment saga, it's far from clear Romney wants the job.\n\nRomney has left the door open further than most, said Reed Galen, a consultant who worked for Sen. John McCain, George W. Bush and Arnold Schwarzenegger before leaving the GOP in 2016. But \"there's a long way from opening a door and walking through it.\"\n\nThe 72-year-old senator is unusually well positioned to take on a president who remains broadly popular with Republican voters. His job security is all but guaranteed in conservative Utah, where he's a near celebrity. Many voters, particularly fellow members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, shared Romney's wariness about Trump.\n\nA nationwide Associated Press survey of midterm voters last year found that while two-thirds of church members voted Republican, just over half approved of Trump's job performance. The VoteCast survey also found that 64% of Utah voters wanted to see the senator confront the president.\n\nHis political brand, forged as a governor in Massachusetts, the savior of the troubled 2002 Olympics and a well-appointed representative of the corporate-friendly wing of GOP, has very little to do with Trump and the populist uprising.\n\nAll of that has some looking to Romney as a possible standard bearer. The anti-Trump conservative group Defending Democracy Together is running new ads in Utah encouraging him to speak out.\n\n\"I think Mitt Romney came back to the Senate for a reason, and I hope this is the reason,\" said Sarah Longwell, the group's executive director. As a former presidential nominee who built his career in part on this capacity for moral leadership, Romney has a role as a Republican elder statesman that few can match, she said. \"This is going to be the moment where Mitt Romney will play, I think, the decisive role in what Republicans do going forward.\"\n\nNot everyone is so sure. While he lashed then-candidate Trump as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud\" in a 2016 speech that didn't keep him from being elected, Romney also dined with Trump as he aimed to become secretary of state and accepted the president's endorsement during his Senate run two years later.\n\nWhile he resumed the charge with a Washington Post op-ed on the eve of his Senate swearing in, Romney also agrees with many Trump administration policies and hasn't taken up a McCain-like maverick mantle. Rather than relishing rhetorical fisticuffs, Romney sees himself as a voice for civility representing a deeply conservative state, said Utah State University political science professor Damon Cann.\n\n\"I think Romney as a senator has been much more conservative than John McCain was,\" both in terms of style and ideology, he said.", "description": "In the hours after President Donald Trump called on China to investigate his political foe \u2014 plowing through another political guardrail \u2014 Democrats and Trump critics looked for signs that his party would slap him back.
