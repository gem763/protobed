Like Equity Income, it was suspended last week.\n\nPeter Hargreaves (pictured) accuses Woodford of running an investment operation 'probably inadequate for purpose'\n\nIt has left Oxford-based Woodford with no choice but to close his business, Woodford Investment Management, that he founded in 2014 after building a reputation as a top manager in the 2000s.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Hargreaves says: 'Was he [Woodford] a great stock-picker? With the benefit of hindsight, I am not sure.\n\n'It appears he didn't have the knowledge in unquoted companies and rarely a week went by without him being steeped in various problems.\n\n'The crux of the matter was his organisation was probably inadequate for purpose \u2013 couldn't cope with the billions that poured in from investors.'\n\nHargreaves also claims Woodford's strategy of buying under-valued stocks no longer worked.\n\n'He hadn't recognised the world is significantly different,' he says.\n\n'Many cyclical stocks won't recover \u2013 they will gradually fade out of business. The investment scene and world economy is greatly changed.'\n\nHargreaves Lansdown, where Mr Hargreaves is a shareholder but no longer an employee, could be fined for its role in heavily promoting Woodford Equity Income despite having concerns over its portfolio.\n\nYesterday, Woodford said he appreciated that many people in the financial industry wished to express their views. He added: 'I am sorry, and I personally deeply regret the impact events have had on The Mail on Sunday readers who placed their faith in Woodford Investment Management and invested in our funds.'", "description": "Peter Hargreaves accuses Woodford of running an investment operation 'probably inadequate for purpose' and says he invested in unquoted businesses without sufficient knowledge.", "authors": ["Jeff Prestridge For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/01/19942296-0-image-a-30_1571531586563.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
