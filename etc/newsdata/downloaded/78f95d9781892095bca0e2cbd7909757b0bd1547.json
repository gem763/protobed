Auto workers joined the walkout over pay, job security and health benefits.\n\nGarrett Nelson, senior equity research analyst at CFRA says the strike could cost GM $100 million a day in lost operating income. (Other estimates have pegged the loss at $50 million in earnings a day from lost production in North America). For stockholders, that would translate into a loss of 3-cents a day for the share price. Shares of GM initially fell following news of the strike, but bounced back Tuesday to rally nearly 2% by the afternoon.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the two sides are still very far apart and there are still so many issues at play here that they have to discuss. We think it could last several days, perhaps weeks,\u201d Nelson told Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d (A couple of the main issues in the negotiations include health care costs and the use of temporary workers, which the UAW wants to limit.)\n\nThe most recent GM strike in 2007 lasted 3 days. By contrast, in 1970 the union stayed off the job for a record 69 days.\n\nImpact on the economy\n\n\u201cGM is not feeling the pressure just yet because we\u2019re in a soft patch in the auto market and their sales have been down so far this year,\u201d said Nelson.\n\nBut a lengthy walkout could soon hurt auto parts suppliers and, eventually, the greater economy.\n\nIn this Monday, Sept. 16, 2019, photo Joe Drumm, who has been with General Motors for 12 years, stands outside of GM plants with other union members picketing in Flint, Mich. (Sara Faraj/The Flint Journal via AP) More\n\nIn 1998, 9,200 workers at two parts plants in Flint, Mich., walked out for 54 days. Economists estimate that strike shaved about half a percentage point off second quarter GDP.\n\nToday, however, GM\u2019s market share of 17% is about half what it was in 1998, which means a protracted strike would most likely have a smaller impact on overall economic growth.\n\n\u201cCurrently the dealers are sitting on about 11 weeks of inventory, which is a reason why we think this strike could go on for an extended period of time,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nJunk bond status\n\nIf the strike lasts more than a week or two, General Motors\u2019 credit rating could be downgraded to junk bond status, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service. That would make it more difficult and expensive for GM to borrow money.\n\nNelson said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised by the credit downgrade.\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors has been in a very difficult situation. In North America, their vehicle sales are down about 5% year-to-date,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t have much product momentum. And they\u2019re so levered to China; four out of every 10 vehicles they sell are in China.\u201d\n\nCurrently, GM\u2019s debt rating is just a notch above junk grade.\n\nLast week, Moody\u2019s downgraded Ford\u2019s (F) credit rating to junk status on concern over its costly and lengthy restructuring plan.\n\nDoes Mary Barra survive?\n\nExperts say this strike is a big test for CEO Mary Barra. It\u2019s the first work stoppage at the automaker since she took the helm in 2014, but Nelson said it\u2019s too early to know if Barra will survive the walkout.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s under a lot of pressure politically. She met with President Trump recently and obviously there will be more tweeting and a lot more pressure if this continues for an extended period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nAlexis Christoforous is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d Follow her on Twitter @AlexisTVNews.\n\nRead more:\n\nCan the US economy handle $100 crude oil?\n\nGM strike risk is high as UAW deadline approaches\n\nTrump's latest Fed tweet is 'irresponsible': economist\n\n'Everybody\u2019s losing the trade war': Strategist\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "The United Auto Workers strike against General Motors could prove costly for the automaker.", "authors": ["Alexis Christoforous"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2_jRIGgTsGq9EgWpi.jUQQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/01b81b20-d973-11e9-be4f-6654b202999e", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
