'If we need a player in an emergency, then for sure he will get his minutes.'\n\nThe message that Muller will be warming the bench for the foreseeable future is now clear\n\nHis one goal so far this season came off the bench in the Champions League win over Red Star\n\nMuller this season August 12 vs Energie Cottbus Started, played 90 minutes August 16 vs Hertha Berlin Started, played 85 minutes August 24 vs Schalke Started, played 57 minutes August 31 vs Mainz On bench, came on in 67th minute, two assists September 14 vs RB Leipzig Started, played 63 minutes, one assist September 18 vs Red Star Belgrade On bench, came on in 83rd minute, one goal September 21 vs Cologne On bench, came on in 71st minute September 28 vs Paderborn On bench, came on in 80th minute October 1 vs Tottenham On bench, did not come on October 5 vs Hoffenheim On bench, came on in 60th minute, one assist\n\nThe message seemed very clear: You will be warming the bench for the foreseeable unless we suffer an injury crisis.\n\nHe has been the unfortunate victim of Kovac's 4-2-3-1 system and the impressive form of Bayern's forwards despite what has occasionally been a shaky start to the season.\n\nLewandowski is in the form of his life, with an astonishing 15 goals in 11 matches so far this season, and isn't likely to be relinquishing the centre forward position anytime soon.\n\nBehind him, the favoured threesome of summer arrival Philippe Coutinho in the No 10 role flanked on the left by Serge Gnabry and the right by Kingsley Coman (or vice versa) has been working well.\n\nThey offer a speed of transition and movement, plus a dynamism going forward, that the more pedestrian Muller simply cannot offer.\n\nLast season, when he started 28 of Bayern's 34 Bundesliga games, Muller typically played wide on the right or as a second striker/No 10 but both options are currently unavailable to him.\n\nWhile Muller looked in his element at Oktoberfest the following day, he cut a more forlorn figure when he uttered 'nothing to say' to reporters in the mixed zone after Saturday's surprise defeat.\n\nAnd all the messages coming from the Muller camp are starting to suggest that a heavy-hearted departure is a possibility - perhaps as soon as January.\n\nSummer signing Philippe Coutinho has excelled in the No 10 role for Bayern this season\n\nThe prolific Robert Lewandowski (left) and Serge Gnabry have been in impressive form\n\nIn the past when out of touch, Muller would take solace right now from a few days away with the Germany national team.\n\nBut he hasn't been involved in the last four of Joachim Low's squads having been brutally told by the manager back in March that he was no longer in his plans.\n\nMuller can reflect with fondness on 100 caps, 38 goals and World Cup triumph with his country but a recall appears further away than ever.\n\nSo it promises to be a long fortnight dwelling on his current predicament before Bayern return to action with a trip to Augsburg on October 19.\n\nMuller was ruthlessly axed from the German squad by Joachim Low earlier this year\n\nLow made clear that Muller was no longer a part of his plans as he reshapes the national team\n\nMuller at Bayern 2008-09 season to present 495 matches 186 goals 171 assists 8 x Bundesliga 5 x German Cup 5 x German Supercup 1 x Champions League 1 x UEFA Super Cup 1 x FIFA Club World Cup\n\nBut even if his days at Bayern now appear numbered, Muller isn't the type to rock the boat and throw a tantrum.\n\nEven after the thrashing of Spurs, he took to Instagram to praise the four-goal performance of Gnabry that he'd watched from the bench.\n\nWhile unhappy about his new role, Muller will continue to keep his counsel and he remains an influential figure in the dressing room to guide Bayern's fortunes in a more indirect manner.\n\nWith Bayern fighting on several fronts as always, there will inevitably come a point in the season when the first-choice attackers need a break or get injured and Muller is first in reserve.\n\nThe hierarchy also view such a symbolic figure, an embodiment of the club and by extension the region, as someone they can't just cast aside lightly.\n\nIt is very difficult to imagine Muller playing for another club in Germany but, all of a sudden, the prospect of him in the colours of another team at some point in the future has increased significantly.\n\nMuller celebrates scoring for Bayern against Arsenal in the 2015 Champions League", "description": "ADAM SHERGOLD: Muller is the first name many football fans would associate with Bayern Munich but for the first time he is being forced to contemplate whether his future lies elsewhere.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19484692-0-image-a-3_1570614942920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
