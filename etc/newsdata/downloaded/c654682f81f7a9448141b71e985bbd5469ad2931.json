Though the theme may be the environment, the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean took precedence as he met with Italian premier Matteo Renzi.\n\nAs Europe struggles to agree on how to deal with the thousands of migrants arriving on its shores, Hollande showed support for Italy in dealing with the influx.\n\n\u201cIt is not because Italy is in the South of Europe that it should together with Greece and Malta, be the (only) ones to make an effort for the benefit of all. It is not Italy\u2019s duty to take care of this operation and this mission, other countries are to be concerned,\u201d he announced at a press conference.\n\nWhile Renzi took aim at an EU agreement which means that migrants must be processed in the first state they entered, which currently puts a lot of pressure on countries with a Mediterranean coastline.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, I do not think that signing the Dublin agreement was a good idea, especially for Italy, but I\u2019m not interested in creating a controversy within my country against the political party that was then in the government,\u201d explained Renzi.\n\nBehind the rhetoric the issue of sharing responsibilities remains visible along the French-Italian border, where many African migrants turned out in Ventimiglia to protest against France blocking them from crossing the frontier.", "description": "French President Francois Hollande tours his country's pavilion in Milan.
