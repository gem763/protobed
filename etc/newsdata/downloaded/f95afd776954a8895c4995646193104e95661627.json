REUTERS/Piroschka Van De Wouw/File Photo\n\nPRAGUE (Reuters) - The Prague state attorney has halted criminal investigations into Prime Minister Andrej Babis, his family members and others, the attorney\u2019s office said on Friday.\n\nThe investigations into accusations of fraud related to European Union subsidies had posed the biggest challenge to Babis\u2019 political career. He denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe investigation was the major reason why a number of Czech political parties refuse to cooperate with Babis\u2019s ruling populist ANO movement. He runs a minority administration together with the centre-left Social Democrats that must lean on Communist Party votes to secure a majority in parliament.\n\nThe case against Babis, the billionaire owner of the chemicals, food, farming and media group Agrofert, focused on a 2 million euro subsidy granted a decade ago for building the Stork\u2019s Nest conference centre outside Prague.\n\nPolice said Babis had transferred ownership of the firm to his wife and other relatives so it would qualify for the funding, which was meant for small businesses.\n\n\u201cThe evidence gathering led to conclusion that the Stork\u2019s Nest Farm met the definition of a small and medium-sized business,\u201d attorney Martin Erazim said in a statement.\n\nThe EU\u2019s anti-fraud body OLAF had found multiple breaches of national and EU legislation in the project.\n\nAgrofert had voluntarily returned the subsidy.", "description": "The Prague state attorney has halted criminal investigations into Prime Minister Andrej Babis, his family members and others, the attorney's office said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429400338&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0UE", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
