You might not have upgraded yet, but Netgear is hoping that you'll pick its upgraded Orbi mesh system when you do.\n\nThe Wi-Fi 6 Mesh system is apparently \"designed for the connected world of today and the future\", taking into account all the always-connected device we keep buying and the increased bandwidth needed for the likes of 4K and 8K streams. Not that there are any 8K streams available to normal people right now. So Netgear is really thinking ahead with this.\n\nLikening the upgrade to upgrading from a four lane to 16 lane motorway, so there's a lot more capacity to ensure the fastest possible speeds. Netgear claims this is the first Wi-Fi 6 mesh system to be brought to market, and obviously that means it's the first to offer that seamless transition between satellites are you move your devices around.\n\nIn my experience it works really well too, though we'll have to see whether upping the available bandwidth makes any difference.\n\nThe downside is that the RRP for the Orbi Wi-Fi 6 Mesh System is \u00a3749 ($1,344) for a single router and satellite. That's more than double the cost of the previous iteration of the Orbi system, so it probably won't be on many people's Christmas lists. But it will be available sometime later this month.\n\nEditor's Note: No word on Australian pricing or local availability just yet.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Gizmodo UK, which is gobbling up the news in a different timezone.", "description": "We've been hearing about Wi-Fi 6 for a little while now, being told that it's the next generation of WiFi designed to support the increasing demands of having all the connected devices in our homes.
