These statements relate to future events or the Company\u2019s future performance. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. The use of any of the words \"anticipate\", \"plan\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"may\", \"will\", \"project\", \"predict\", \"potential\", \"should\", \"believe\" and similar expressions is intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond the Company\u2019s control, the Company cannot assure that it will achieve or accomplish the expectations, beliefs or projections described in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. These forward-looking statements include but are not limited to, statements concerning:\n\na forecasted increase in production and a reduction in operating costs;\n\n\n\nour strategies and objectives;\n\n\n\nour estimates of the availability and quantity of tailings, and the quality of our mine plan estimates;\n\n\n\nprices and price volatility for copper and other commodities and of materials we use in our operations;\n\n\n\nthe demand for and supply of copper and other commodities and materials that we produce, sell and use;\n\n\n\nsensitivity of our financial results and share price to changes in commodity prices;\n\n\n\nour financial resources and our expected ability to meet our obligations for the next 12 months;\n\n\n\ninterest and other expenses;\n\n\n\ndomestic and foreign laws affecting our operations;\n\n\n\nour tax position and the tax rates applicable to us;\n\n\n\nthe timing and costs of construction and tolling/production of, and the issuance and maintenance of the necessary permits and other authorizations required for, our expansion projects, including the expansion for the Cauquenes deposit and the timing of ramp-up to full production from Cauquenes;\n\n\n\nour ability to procure or have access to financing and to comply with our loan covenants;\n\n\n\nthe production capacity of our operations, our planned production levels and future production;\n\n\n\npotential impact of production and transportation disruptions;\n\nhazards inherent in the mining industry causing personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, claims by third parties and suspension of operations\n\nour planned capital expenditures (including our plan to upgrade our existing plant and operations) including the timing and cost of completion of our capital projects;\n\nestimates of asset retirement obligations and other costs related to environmental protection;\n\n\n\nour future capital and production costs, including the costs and potential impact of complying with existing and proposed environmental laws and regulations in the operation and closure of our operations;\n\n\n\nrepudiation, nullification, modification or renegotiation of contracts;\n\n\n\nour financial and operating objectives;\n\n\n\nour environmental, health and safety initiatives;\n\n\n\nthe outcome of legal proceedings and other disputes in which we may be involved;\n\n\n\nthe outcome of negotiations concerning metal sales, treatment charges and royalties;\n\n\n\ndisruptions to the Company's information technology systems, including those related to cybersecurity;\n\n\n\nour dividend policy; and\n\n\n\ngeneral business and economic conditions.\n\nInherent in forward-looking statements are risks and uncertainties beyond our ability to predict or control, including risks that may affect our operating or capital plans; risks generally encountered in the permitting and development of mineral projects such as unusual or unexpected geological formations, negotiations with government and other third parties, unanticipated metallurgical difficulties, delays associated with permits, approvals and permit appeals, ground control problems, adverse weather conditions, process upsets and equipment malfunctions; risks associated with labour disturbances and availability of skilled labour and management; fluctuations in the market prices of our principal commodities, which are cyclical and subject to substantial price fluctuations; risks created through competition for mining projects and properties; risks associated with lack of access to markets; risks associated with availability of and our ability to obtain both tailings from Codelco\u2019s Division El Teniente\u2019s current production and historic tailings from tailings deposit; risks with respect to completion of all phases of the Cauquenes expansion, the ability of the Company to draw down funds from bank facilities and lines of credit, the availability of and ability of the Company to obtain adequate funding on reasonable terms for expansions and acquisitions, including all phases of the Cauquenes expansion; mine plan estimates; risks posed by fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates, as well as general economic conditions; risks associated with environmental compliance and changes in environmental legislation and regulation; risks associated with our dependence on third parties for the provision of critical services; risks associated with non-performance by contractual counterparties; title risks; social and political risks associated with operations in foreign countries; risks of changes in laws affecting our operations or their interpretation, including foreign exchange controls; and risks associated with tax reassessments and legal proceedings. Many of these risks and uncertainties apply not only to the Company and its operations, but also to Codelco and its operations. Codelco\u2019s ongoing mining operations provide a significant portion of the materials the Company processes and its resulting metals production, therefore these risks and uncertainties may also affect their operations and in turn have a material effect on the Company.\n\n\n\nActual results and developments are likely to differ, and may differ materially, from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this news release.
