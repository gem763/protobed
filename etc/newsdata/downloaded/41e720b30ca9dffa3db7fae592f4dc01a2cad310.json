The Saskatoon-based firm\u2019s stock price fell just under a per cent to $64.64 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nMagro declined to comment, but questions about Jansen have dogged him for months if not years.\n\n\u201cI will tell you this, every time that a company has tried to build greenfield potash mines around the world, it has been a very difficult project to create long-term shareholder value,\u201d Magro said in May at the BMO Farm to Market Conference in New York.\n\nIn July, Susan Jones, then head of Nutrien\u2019s potash segment, echoed that pessimism, saying on an earnings call that potash prices \u201cneed to be significantly higher\u201d to justify building Jansen.\n\nMagro also said his company was committed to producing 5 million tons of potash per year regardless. Potash constitutes its largest business segment in 2018, accounting for 37 per cent of adjusted cash flows, or about $1.6 billion.\n\nMagro\u2019s job may ultimately hang in the balance of what BHP decides. Earlier this month, BMO Capital Markets\u2019 analyst Joel Jackson suggested a price decline of $100 per ton could \u201cthreaten the viability of many incumbent mines as well as C-suite jobs.\u201d\n\nThe Southeast Asian standard benchmark for potash stood at around US$290 per tonne this month, with prices having fallen by nearly half in the past decade.\n\nNow, analysts are predicting producers may flood the market with potash to lower prices \u2014 a double-edged sword that could deter BHP, but also hurt earnings.\n\n\u201cWe suspect producers are now trying to \u2018scare\u2019 BHP that if Jansen is approved, current mines will run full out and drive prices lower,\u201d Jackson wrote in an Oct. 2 note. \u201cHowever, BHP may call this bluff considering producers have made room\u201d for other projects.\n\nLast month, however, Nutrien declared a \u2018slowdown\u2019 in the potash market, and announced a temporary shutdown of three mines in Saskatchewan, affecting 700 workers.\n\nBHP has in the past mined potash in Ethiopia and long eyed Canada\u2019s Prairies. In 2010, it placed a $38.6 billion hostile bid for the Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, but withdrew in the face of federal government opposition. Ultimately, Potash Corp. and Agrium Inc. merged in 2018 to create Nutrien with a $28 billion market capitalization.\n\nToday, BHP is known as an iron ore miner that also produces copper, coal and petroleum. With a US$121-billion market capitalization, it is one of the largest mining companies in the world, and has faced pressure to improve its environmental record, including from activists who showed up at its annual meeting in London on Thursday.\n\nBHP\u2019s stock fell 3.27 per cent to AUS$34.86 on the Australian Stock Exchange.\n\nAndrew MacKenzie, chief executive of BHP, has said entering the potash market would improve the company\u2019s environmental profile, and characterized it as a \u201c100-year\u201d strategy.\n\n\u201cAs well as offering diversification away from fossil fuels, it also offers diversification again away from over dependence on China,\u201d MacKenzie said on an earnings call in February.\n\nBHP describes Jansen as 82 per cent complete, with shafts already excavated, even though many analysts say the mine won\u2019t begin producing before the end of 2024.\n\nAlexis Maxwell, research director with Bloomberg\u2019s Green Markets, has also predicted that potash producers may ramp up production to deter BHP from constructing Jansen.\n\n\u201cThe biggest threat to the potash long term outlook is the decision from BHP with their Jansen mine up in Northern Canada,\u201d she said at a conference in April. \u201cNow, this mine is expected.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: gfriedman@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GabeFriedz", "description": "If constructed, mine would add 4.4 million tonnes of potash per year, potentially enough to drive down prices and deal a blow to Nutrien", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/potash.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
