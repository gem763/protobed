Yankees manager Aaron Boone said he expects him to be OK but pulled him as a precaution. Torres leads the AL East champions with 38 home runs and is hitting .284 with 90 RBIs.\n\nAaron Judge and Tyler Wade homered for the Yankees a day after they clinched the division. New York is still competing for the best record in the majors and home-field advantage throughout the postseason - the Yankees and Houston each began the day with 100 wins.\n\nJustin Smoak hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the seventh to help Toronto match a season high with its fifth straight victory. He connected off Tommy Kahnle (3-2) as the Yankees\u2019 bullpen wobbled in the late innings for the third time in a week.\n\nDanny Jansen also homered for the Blue Jays. Jason Adam (2-0) won in relief. and Ken Giles closed for his 21st save in 22 chances.\n\nTorres was shaken up in the fourth. With Cavan Biggio running from second, Torres skidded to stop Vladimir Guerrero Jr.\u2019s grounder up the middle and sprung to his feet to throw home. But his plant leg gave way, and he went down hard as Biggio scored.\n\nThe awkward tumble prompted the crowd of 45,270 to gasp, and manager Aaron Boone and head athletic trainer Steve Donohue came out to check on Torres. After a few moments, Torres got up and stayed in through the sixth.\n\nThe Yankees have been beset by injuries this year, with several stars banged up heading into their Division Series opener Oct. 4.\n\nYankees starter J.A. Happ allowed two runs and four hits in 5 1/3 innings, giving up his 34th home run. He worked around an early triple on a flyball misplayed by right fielder Clint Frazier.\n\nROSTER MOVE\n\nThe Blue Jays claimed INF Breyvic Valera off waivers from the Yankees. He\u2019ll join his new team Saturday. RHP Ryan Dull, recently claimed from the Yankees, was designated for assignment.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBlue Jays: SS Bo Bichette is likely to miss this weekend series after being hit on the helmet by a pitch Thursday night in Baltimore. The 21-year-old rookie is batting .311 with 11 home runs in 46 games.\n\n\u201cIt could be a few days, three days, a week,\u201d manager Charlie Montoyo said. \u201cIf I had to guess, Bo wants to play today but realistically \u2026 I don\u2019t see him playing these three days.\u201d\n\nYankees: OF Giancarlo Stanton got a day off after playing two days in the field. He\u2019s set to start Saturday. \u2026 Slugger Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n (oblique) is expected to play next week, Boone said. C Gary S\u00e1nchez (groin tightness) is recovering more slow than Encarnaci\u00f3n, but Boone is \u201coptimistic he\u2019ll be ready for the postseason.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlue Jays: Rookie RHP T.J. Zeuch (1-0, 4.61 ERA) got his first MLB win in his previous outing, going 5 1/3 innings in relief vs. the Yankees last Sunday.\n\nYankees: LHP James Paxton (14-6, 3.88) has won a career-best nine straight starts. He beat Toronto last weekend in his most recent game and pitches this time on six days\u2019 rest.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Star second baseman Gleyber Torres prompted an audible gasp from the Yankee Stadium crowd when his right leg buckled while fielding a grounder and made an early exit Friday night as New York lost to the Toronto Blue Jays 4-3.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ben Walker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/blue_jays_yankees_baseball_68874_c0-112-2664-1665_s1770x1032.jpg?66714895e93f18e55b47fc57e4b2a5bcc7318827", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
