The first black undergraduate was not admitted until 1988.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

He came to prominence over the summer when he went to Sweden to push for the release of rapper A$AP Rocky, who was being held on assault charges.\n\nIn an email to The Guardian, Mr Jansen - who served as vice chancellor from 2009 to 2017 - said there were \u201cno black students or staff except those cleaning the place and working the gardens etc.\u201d\n\nUFS chemistry professor Karel von Eschwege, who became close friends with Mr O\u2019Brien, told Netwerk24 that Mr O\u2019Brien wanted to study in South Africa to personally investigate \u201cthe most hated political system\u201d in the world - apartheid.\n\nIn an interview with Afrikaner rights advocacy group AfriForum in 2017, Mr O\u2019Brien spoke of his study in South Africa 30 years earlier under an international exchange scholarship for students at the University of California\u2019s Los Angeles campus.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, South Africans are the most hospitable people in the world and I have especially experienced this at Kovsies.\n\n\u201cThe Afrikaans students in my residence were very interested in the USA and had more knowledge of other world events than my American friends. My classmates were also very helpful and made an effort to help me with Afrikaans.\u201d", "description": "A university attended by Donald Trump\u2019s new national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien on an undergraduate exchange program in\u00a0South Africa\u00a0has been described as \"routinely racist\".", "authors": ["Justin Vallejo"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/21/ap-19261661205123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
