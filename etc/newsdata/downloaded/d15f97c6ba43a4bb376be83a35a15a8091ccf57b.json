Regular nosebleeds are now a reminder of his physical and mental trauma.\n\nDuring nearly five months of civil unrest that have rocked the city of 7.5 million, K\u2019s experience is not isolated.\n\nProtesters, lawyers, educators, politicians have made multiple allegations against the police of excessive force, abuse of power and a collapse of accountability as unidentifiable officers, their badges hidden, appear to breach the city\u2019s law and their own rules of conduct.\n\nK said he was heading home from protests when he was attacked by undercover police Credit: Charlotte Graham More\n\nSince mass protests began in June over an extradition bill that has since been scrapped, police have arrested more than 2,500 protesters and fired almost 5,000 rounds of tear gas, often engulfing innocent bystanders. Rubber bullets and water cannons are now the norm on the streets of the financial hub.\n\nDuring its botched handling of unrest that has snowballed into a wide demand for freedoms, the government has hidden behind the police, pushing embattled officers onto the frontlines, and locking them into a spiral of heavy-handed tactics to counter escalating frustration and violence.\n\nOnce considered Asia\u2019s finest, the force is now openly feared and reviled by much of the public. Cases like K\u2019s have fueled cries for an independent commission of inquiry into allegations of police brutality, a demand which has become key to resolving the city\u2019s political meltdown.\n\nOn Thursday, Carrie Lam, the territory\u2019s chief executive, said she would not \u201cblindly support\u201d officers accused of violence, only to be immediately slapped down by Beijing, which pledged \u201cunwavering support\u201d for the 30,000-strong force.\n\nMeanwhile public anger is building.\n\nIn interviews with the Telegraph, K described how he was resting with a group of protest \u201cfrontliners\u201d on a main street in bustling Causeway Bay shortly before 10pm on August 11 when they were suddenly set upon by officers dressed in the black clothes and helmets of the anti-government movement.\n\nMany protesters in the city wear masks to avoid identification by security services Credit: AP More", "description": "It\u2019s hard for \u201cK\u201d to pinpoint the exact moment he believes he suffered a brain haemorrhage during a violent arrest by two undercover officers in Hong Kong\u2019s main shopping district at the end of a long day of pro-democracy protests in August.\u00a0 The Hong Kong teenager, too afraid to be named, has now returned", "authors": ["Nicola Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Sn96qdUTMB2lPKI9CkeeBQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/198860344dfb2da6032ad3823e2ace03", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
