He described his own efforts \u2014which are still in the planning stages \u2014 as likely bearing the hallmarks of a traditional political operation: a \u201crapid response, messaging, surrogate program.\u201d\n\nThe operation would have a \u201c10-man staff\u201d and take on many of the roles of a traditional war room.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna do polling,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m doing it.\u201d\n\nEncouraged by the reception of his recently launched \u201cWar Room: Impeachment\u201d radio show \u2014 intended largely for a conservative grassroots audience \u2014 Bannon intends to carry his anti-impeachment message into the media mainstream.\n\n\u201cI don't see any intensity level,\u201d Bannon lamented, speaking last Friday from the Capitol Hill townhouse where for years he has led a populist revolt, whether as the chief executive of Breitbart News or the chairman of the Trump presidential campaign in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not even in the heat of this thing yet,\u201d Bannon warned. \u201cThe heat is about to come.\u201d\n\nTo counter what he sees as a \u201cmaster class\u201d in \u201cpolitical warfare\u201d now being waged by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who announced an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine last month, Bannon intends to augment a daily broadcast with an actual war room \u2014 of the kind that the White House has thus far resisted implementing, opting instead for informal meetings by existing staff.\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski testifies at a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee last month.

But they remain profoundly loyal to Trump and are already spending much of their time defending the president, albeit informally. Bannon did not say he planned to hire them explicitly, only that they could muster the pugnacity and outrage he was looking for.\n\nA spokeswoman for Bannon confirmed that a war room was in the works. She said the effort would be funded by Republican donors. No decisions have been made about hiring, and the effort is being vetted for legal propriety.\n\nIn his classic political dictionary, New York Times columnist William Safire defined a \u201cwar room\u201d as a \u201ccommand post for directing a military, political, or business campaign.\u201d Safire dates modern usage of the term to 1992, when Hillary Clinton used it to describe her husband\u2019s campaign operations in Little Rock, Ark. Bill Clinton later had an impeachment war room of his own. More recently, the Trump administration ran a war room during the Supreme Court confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh, who had been accused of sexual assault.", "description": "Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is launching an increasingly aggressive defense of President Trump, promising to soon open a staffed \u201cwar room\u201d that will forcefully counteract the fast-moving Democratic impeachment effort.", "authors": ["Alexander Nazaryan", "National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/m1340nmnJ3xL2nqCA85XJQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/c74763b0-f9a7-11e9-9dbf-c694bc97e11f", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
