(Courtesy Jan Terry, Lurie Children's Hospital) More\n\nIn June 2018, Johnny was diagnosed with desmoplastic small round cell tumors. After suffering a severe stomach ache that stripped him of his appetite and made his belly protrude for weeks, Boyer knew that her son was sick, but she didn\u2019t expect what illness was to come.\n\nDoctors didn\u2019t catch Johnny\u2019s cancer diagnosis until his third hospital visit -- but this time it was during a visit to the emergency room.\n\n\"When [the emergency room doctor] came in to tell us, she was already in tears before she was even able to get a word out. That\u2019s how severe it was,\" Boyer said.\n\n(MORE: 80-year-old crossing guard 'speechless' as children surprise him on birthday)\n\nDuring his first inpatient stay -- which lasted for over two months -- Boyer said that Johnny liked to look out the window to a park down below where people would jog and walk their dogs. Although she had already been looking to add another dog to the family for years, Boyer noticed that with his new view, Johnny started to up the ante in his quest for his favorite corgi puppy.\n\n\"He would always just come back around, 'Yeah that would be great mom, but so would a little puppy,'\" Boyer said.\n\nJohnny\u2019s love and chatter about his \"dream dog\" caught the attention of a hospital social worker who submitted his wish for a puppy to Little Wish Foundation.\n\nPHOTO: Johnny received his corgi puppy from Little Wish Foundation, whose founder Liz Niemiec is pictured above to Johnny's right. (Courtesy Jan Terry, Lurie Children's Hospital) More\n\nLiz Niemiec, the founder of Little Wish Foundation, told \"Good Morning America\" that since 2010, the foundation has worked with children\u2019s hospitals across the country to grant wishes under $1,000 that will bring \"immediate joy\" to pediatric cancer patients. One of their specialties is giving kids their dream dogs.\n\n\"Whenever we get a puppy request, it\u2019s extra special. \u2026 We were super excited and all over it,\" Niemiec said.\n\nPuppy requests mean a lot not only to the foundation, but also to Niemiec personally. She started the foundation when she was 16 after her friend Max died of cancer. His last wish was for a puppy.\n\nLast Thursday, Niemiec and some volunteers from Little Wish Foundation presented Johnny with a black-and-white corgi puppy -- a \"Max wish,\" as they call it.\n\n\"She was so sweet. \u2026 She knew she was going to do a job and that was to make him happy,\" Niemiec said.\n\nPHOTO: Michelle Boyer, Johnny's mom, said that the bond between Johnny and his new puppy was instantaneous. (Courtesy Jan Terry, Lurie Children's Hospital) More\n\nNiemiec asked Johnny of all the puppies he could have, why a corgi?\n\n\"He\u2019s like, 'You know I just really like corgis. The Queen has a corgi,'\" Niemic said.", "description": "Amid chemotherapy, radiation and a 26-hour long surgery to fight cancerous tumors, 12-year-old Johnny Martin only wanted to talk about one thing.
