The contortions have been agonising. He thinks if he can just get back to core Labour values and on to issues where the party's traditionally strong, he can eat into Boris's poll lead.'\n\nThe claims surfaced just as the gulf between Mr Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor Mr McDonnell appeared to widen over backing a second referendum rather than insisting first on a General Election, the latter being party policy.\n\nMr McDonnell, accused last week of now being the 'real Labour leader', appeared along with fellow frontbencher Diane Abbott at a rally in London for the People's Vote campaign to force a second poll.\n\nSpeaking to jubilant crowds after MPs voted to delay approval for Mr Johnson's deal, Mr McDonnell declared: 'We cannot support this deal. It is now time to revert to the fundamental principle that underlies our democracy. Let our people decide. Let democracy reign once again.' Shadow Home Secretary Ms Abbott said: 'I am here to support this rally for a People's Vote. I am a Remainer, my constituency is a solid Remain constituency. I have come from defeating Boris and his terrible deal.'\n\nThe Opposition leader has condemned Mr Johnson's new deal and says he will whip his MPs to vote against it when it is put to a new meaningful vote, which could be as early as tomorrow\n\nArch-Remainer and ex-Tory MP Dominic Grieve (pictured), who is co-chairman of the People's Vote political committee, said: 'We could hear you in the chamber. This is a pivotal point in our history, we know we are close to a People's Vote'\n\nAnd arch-Remainer and ex-Tory MP Dominic Grieve, who is co-chairman of the People's Vote political committee, said: 'We could hear you in the chamber. This is a pivotal point in our history, we know we are close to a People's Vote.'\n\nOne senior Labour MP said last night: 'It's pretty clear what's going on here. McDonnell and Abbott appearing at the second referendum fest is another nail in the coffin for Corbyn's insistence that we must have an Election first.'\n\nHowever, some Labour MPs that the party could haemorrhage seats in an early Election, with some saying Mr Corbyn's insistence on an Election is 'plain bonkers'.\n\nIn a further split, Corbyn critic Jess Phillips is being touted as the 'face of Remain' in a second referendum campaign. The Mail on Sunday understands that private polling for one pro-second referendum group has revealed that the Birmingham MP, alongside former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, would be the best person to front the campaign.\n\nMs Phillips said last week that she might stand to be Labour leader if Mr Corbyn stood down, amid reports that the 'tired' Labour leader was preparing to stand aside.\n\nLast night a Labour spokesman dismissed suggestions Mr Corbyn wanted to lose the Brexit deal vote as 'nonsense'. He said: 'Jeremy has argued forcefully in Parliament and interviews that Johnson's sell-off deal is deeply damaging.'", "description": "Labour's Brexit civil war dramatically escalated Saturday night amid claims Jeremy Corbyn wants to lose a new crunch vote on Boris Johnson's deal.", "authors": ["Glen Owen", "Brendan Carlin For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19938506-0-image-a-36_1571522129040.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
