Due to some backstage dog wrangling that delayed its start time, the event began a full hour late, which gave the scene an air of legitimacy during a week not known for promptness.\n\nBut don\u2019t put the blame on any of the very good boys and girls who cantered down the runway once the show did go on; the Boston Terriers, Chihuahuas, and assorted mutts were dressed to the nines in gilded capes and bedazzled leashes, which they modeled with aplomb.\n\nThough the cast favored small pups who were carried by professional (human) models, there was a bit of diversity in size. One extremely jolly yellow lab bounded down the aisle with its tail wagging and tongue out, looking very baroque in a brocade vest.\n\nOne larger hound, ever the professional, looked nervous onstage but kept walking anyway. He probably knew he looked good in his embroidered tulle coat. But the show\u2019s true prince was Rubio\u2019s own dog, Kimba, a chihuahua with a miniature hat to match.\n\nDressed in a jewel-tone poncho with canary yellow ruffles, a tricorne hat covered his eyes. He looked like he might have been asleep. Or maybe he was just calm and confident, knowing his tiny outfit was so on point.", "description": "At Anthony Rubio's doggy dress-up show, the Boston Terriers, Chihuahuas, and various mutts were dressed to the nines in gilded capes and bedazzled leashes, all modeled with aplomb.", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Brooke L.
