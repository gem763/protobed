Mr. Bogotaj himself would be proud.\n\nVirtually everything Democrats told us about this phone call turns out not to have been true.\n\nIt began, you will recall, with the allegation that the president had \u201cpromised\u201d something to Mr. Zelensky. Then that allegation morphed into a reverse promise \u2013 that Mr. Trump had threatened to cut off U.S. aid to Ukraine if Mr. Zelensky did not do what Mr. Trump demanded. Mr. Trump had referenced former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s name eight times, it was reported.\n\nNone of these things, it turns out, is accurate. The transcript reveals no quid pro quo, no commingling of offers, or threats, with asks.\n\nInstead, the transcript of the 30-minute phone call reveals that President Trump used the name \u201cBiden\u201d a total of three times, not eight \u2014 once in reference to former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, and twice to Mr. Biden himself \u2014 over a total of two sentences about two-thirds of the way into the phone call.\n\nReads the transcript: \u201cThe other thing, There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General that would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nYet, Democrats continue to press forward with their \u201cofficial\u201d impeachment inquiry. Said Speaker Pelosi Wednesday morning, before she had even read the transcript: \u201cThe fact is that the president of the United States, in breach of his constitutional responsibilities, has asked a foreign government to help him in his political campaign, at the expense of our national security, as well as undermining the integrity of our elections. That cannot stand. He will be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d\n\nIn Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s view, asking the new Ukrainian president to investigate what happened in 2016 is \u201chelp\u201d to the Trump re-election campaign, and that is a \u201cbreach\u201d of his \u201cconstitutional responsibilities.\u201d What rubbish.\n\nThis is only news because Mr. Biden is running for the Democratic nomination for president. If he were not running now, there would be nothing at all remarkable about an American president asking a new Ukrainian president to look into what may or may not have happened years ago.\n\nMrs. Pelosi says, \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d I agree. But no one is below the law, either. Should the fact that Mr. Biden is now running for president be allowed to shield his previous activities from investigation? Mr. Biden never should have done what he did in 2016 in the first place \u2014 once his son accepted a paid position on the board of directors of a Ukrainian company, Mr. Biden should have been conflicted out of having anything to do with Ukraine. Instead, he traveled to Ukraine and threatened to withhold a billion dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not immediately fire the very prosecutor who was investigating his son\u2019s company \u2014 and then later bragged that he had succeeded in having that prosecutor fired.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Joe Biden\u2019s son did anything wrong in Ukraine. But I do know you\u2019d have to be blind not to see the conflict of interest in the former vice president doing what he did. To think that no one should investigate that because he is now, years later, running for president, is absurd.\n\nDemocrats claim that President Trump believes himself to be \u201cabove the law.\u201d The truth is the exact opposite \u2014 it is the Democrats, not President Trump, who believe they can act in their own interest with impunity. Mr. Biden never should have traveled to Ukraine, let alone threatened to cut off aid to Ukraine, after his son started taking money from a Ukrainian company.\n\nNext year, the voters will render their verdict \u2014 and I\u2019ll wager Democrats will be disappointed.
