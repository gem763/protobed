Jones also sought to turn up the heat on the All Blacks, who are bidding for a third straight World Cup win, by claiming England have nothing to lose and that New Zealand will be feeling the pressure.\n\nJones believes that his squad\u2019s training session in Tokyo Bay on Tuesday was filmed from a nearby high-rise apartment block and joked that England had someone spying on the All Blacks in response.\n\nReferee Jaco Peyper snubbed for Rugby World Cup semi-final after photo row Read more\n\nIn the buildup to last autumn\u2019s meeting with the All Blacks, Jones revealed he had asked the England players who had toured New Zealand with the British & Irish Lions to compile dossiers on their opponents. When asked if he would be revisiting them, Jones instead revealed the suspected security breach. \u201cSo you were the bloke up in the apartment block today filming,\u201d he said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThere was definitely someone in the apartment block filming but it might have been a Japanese fan. I don\u2019t care mate. We have got someone there at [New Zealand training] now. Everyone knows what everyone does so there are no surprises in world rugby any more. That\u2019s the great thing about the game, you just have to be good enough on the day.\u201d\n\nEngland are this week training at Arcs Urayasu Park, 15 minutes from their hotel, which overlooks Disneyland. Jones chose that hotel, rather than the one where England were based in the heart of Tokyo earlier in the tournament, but it is a place well-known to New Zealand. The All Blacks were based in the same hotel 12 months ago for their fixtures against Australia and Japan.\n\nJones admitted that he has conducted spying missions in the past but claimed he has not done so since 2001, and he would not say on which team. \u201cYou just don\u2019t need to do it any more, you can see everything,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can watch everyone\u2019s training on YouTube. There\u2019s no value in doing that sort of thing, absolutely zero. We knew [we were being filmed] from the start, it doesn\u2019t change anything, we love it.\u201d\n\nIf All Blacks can douse England\u2019s power, will Jones\u2019s men be able to react? | Nick Evans Read more\n\nEngland will contest their first World Cup semi-final in 12 years on Saturday against a New Zealand side who have not lost a World Cup match since 2007. Jones has recently claimed New Zealand are the greatest team in sporting history but insisted that they are beatable and believes that the Lions\u2019 drawn series two years ago proved to the England players that the All Blacks are fallible.\n\n\u201c[Our players] know they\u2019re human. They bleed, they drop balls, they miss tackles like every other player,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to take the time and space away so that we put them under pressure. New Zealand talk about walking towards pressure, well, this week the pressure is going to be chasing them down the street.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reality of it, that\u2019s how we\u2019re approaching it. We\u2019ve got nothing to lose, that\u2019s the exciting thing for us. We can just go out there and play our game. If we\u2019re good enough we\u2019ll win, if we\u2019re not good enough we\u2019ve done our best.\n\nHansen and Jones show respect \u2013 and confidence they can overcome | Gerard Meagher Read more\n\n\u201cThe busiest bloke in Tokyo this week will be Gilbert Enoka, the [New Zealand] mental skills coach. They have to deal with all this pressure of winning the World Cup three times and it is potentially the last game for their greatest coach and their greatest captain and they will be thinking about those things. Those thoughts go through your head. It is always harder to defend a World Cup and they will be thinking about that, and therefore there is pressure.\u201d\n\nJones was asked by a New Zealand journalist if he thought the All Blacks would take notice. He responded: \u201cWell, someone has to ask them a question because the New Zealand media doesn\u2019t \u2013 you guys are just fans with a keyboard. Someone has to ask them some questions. The English media, a week ago I was going to get sacked, we couldn\u2019t play. We deal with a completely different situation.\u201d", "description": "England coach Eddie Jones says his team\u2019s preparation for Saturday\u2019s semi-final against New Zealand was filmed from a nearby apartment", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f10802d0bd8149a701630ac740e830f427481e7/323_54_2285_1371/master/2285.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=554136195314f4114935fae7feaab1d1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
