REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nThe council approved an $8.7 billion legislative package to close Rikers and three other jails, replace them with four more humane facilities throughout the city, and eventually turn Rikers Island itself into a public space.\n\n\u201cRikers Island is a symbol of brutality and inhumanity and it is time for us to once and for all close Rikers Island,\u201d City Council Speaker Corey Johnson told colleagues before the vote.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I am overstating it when I say that for many of us this is one of the most significant votes of our entire career,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 400-acre (160-hectare) island in the East River, connected by bridge to the borough of Queens, is home to nine jails with about 7,000 inmates. Most are defendants awaiting trial or serving sentences of less than one year.\n\nTwo decades ago, when the city\u2019s crime rates were at their peak, Rikers\u2019 population numbered more than 20,000 inmates.\n\nIn 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed closing Rikers within 10 years, and in 2018 the city stopped holding inmates between the ages of 16 and 18.A U.S. Justice Department investigation in 2014 found their constitutional rights were routinely violated though inmate-on-inmate violence, virtual solitary confinement, and excessive force by guards.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we find that a deep-seated culture of violence is pervasive throughout the adolescent facilities at Rikers,\u201d United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York said.\n\nA New York state Commission of Correction report in 2018 called for expediting the closure, citing a \u201cspiraling year to year increase of violent incidents and degrading conditions facing both inmates and staff.\u201d\n\nMembers of the mostly liberal city council said the city was trying to end a culture of mass incarceration and what critics across the United States call the \u201cprison-industrial complex,\u201d saying drug addicts and the mentally ill were too often wrongly punished in jail and that ethnic minorities were disproportionately locked up.\n\nBesides Rikers, the city will also close jails in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, where inmates sometimes lacked heating in the winter or air conditioning in the summer.\n\n\u201cThese facilities aren\u2019t as famous as Rikers Island but they are equally horrific and inhumane,\u201d Johnson said.", "description": "The New York City Council voted on Thursday to close the city's infamous Rikers Island jail complex by 2026, casting off a detention system plagued by chronic violence and decrepit facilities, as the nation rethinks mass incarceration.", "authors": ["Daniel Trotta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1442049152&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G27Z", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
