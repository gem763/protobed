(AP) - A woman who says she was raped by an ex-university of Delaware baseball player accused of multiple sexual assaults has told conflicting accounts of their encounter and may have regretted being physically intimate with him, a defense attorney told jurors in closing arguments Thursday.\n\nTexts the woman exchanged with friends before she drove to Clay Conaway\u2019s house last year indicate she was \u201chungry for sex,\u201d and understood that he wanted to have sex as well, defense attorney Joe Hurley said.\n\nThe woman, 21, told friends in text messages that she had advised Conaway, 23, she was not interested in having sex during their first meeting, and that he indicated that he understood. But just hours before driving to his house in June 2018, the woman wondered whether he might want her to perform oral sex.\n\n\u201cHow honest was it when she told the police she went over there believing it was just going to be a hangout session and not sexual?\u201d Hurley asked.\n\n\u201cWhat if \u2026 temptation was knocking on the door and she thought she was going to be strong enough to resist it \u2026 and she went to a green light mode?\u201d he added.\n\nHurley also played excerpts from a police interview during which Conaway adamantly and repeatedly denied having sexual intercourse with the woman.\n\n\u201cWe never had sex \u2026 at all,\u201d Conaway told a detective, acknowledging that he did penetrate the woman with his fingers on more than one occasion and rubbed his genitals against hers.\n\nA forensics expert testified that male DNA was found on vaginal swabs taken from the woman, but there was no evidence of sperm cells.\n\nThe encounter came three weeks after the woman and Conaway connected on the online meeting site Bumble and he sent her a nude picture of himself. She is among six women whom Conaway is accused of sexually assaulting between 2013 and 2018.\n\nConaway is charged in the instant case with first-degree rape, which involves intentional penetration with the genitalia without consent, causing injury. The jury also will be allowed to consider lesser charges of second-degree rape and fourth-degree rape. Second-degree rape involves intentional penetration with the genitalia without consent, while fourth-degree rape involves intentional penetration with any object or body part without consent.\n\n\u201cIntent is critical,\u201d Hurley told the jury, adding that they must determine whether the woman ever expressly indicated to Conaway through her words or actions that she did not consent to what he was doing.\n\n\u201cIs there a red light shining so that he can see it and be aware of it?\u201d he said. \u201cAmber is not good enough.\u201d\n\nProsecutor Rebecca Anderson argued that the woman\u2019s only mistake was taking Conaway at his word when he indicated \u201cthat they would just cuddle and get to know each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe defendant proceeded with his plan to have sex \u2026 that night,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately he got his wish.\u201d\n\nAnderson also said the woman, who said she suffered a hip injury during the encounter, also expressed \u201cdiscomfort and unhappiness\u201d when he began penetrating her with his fingers, before he eventually raped her.\n\n\u201cShe told him \u2018no.\u2019 She asked him repeatedly, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019\u201d Anderson said. \u201cDoes that really sound like someone who was into what was happening?\u201d\n\nJury deliberations begin Friday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A woman who says she was raped by an ex-university of Delaware baseball player accused of multiple sexual assaults has told conflicting accounts of their encounter and may have regretted being physically intimate with him, a defense attorney told jurors in closing arguments Thursday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Randall Chase"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/former_athlete_rape_charges_91944_c0-534-1600-1466_s1770x1032.jpg?6b8bbeaba86efa55e23d0cd5d8693c86d396f3e6", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
