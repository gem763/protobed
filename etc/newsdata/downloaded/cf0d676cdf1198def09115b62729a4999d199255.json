The phenomenon is now occurring on a unusually large scale from northern California to Colorado and Texas, shining a light on the arachnids\u2019 remarkable mating behavior, which can involve dancing and cannibalism.\n\nFor the first five to eight years of their lives, males live in a burrow, eating insects and maybe a mouse or snake. Tarantulas are wait-and-see predators; it\u2019s quite a solitary life. \u201cThen one day, they just pick up and leave in search of a willing female,\u201d said Ana Cholo, a National Park Service public affairs officer who keeps a tarantula as a pet.\n\nMale tarantulas aren\u2019t mature until they reach age five, or eight, or 10 \u2013 depending on the species, said Forest Urban, manager of the invertebrate program with the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. \u201cTypically in all of spiderdom, males are much smaller and don\u2019t live very long at all compared to females,\u201d he said, which can make it to age 30. One reason for the size differential is that it takes a great deal of metabolic energy for females to produce and carry eggs, far more than it costs males to produce sperm.\n\nEach year, starting in the late summer, it\u2019s a guys week out, if you will. \u201cDing dong, it\u2019s time,\u201d said Urban. \u201cAll of a sudden, the eight-to-12-year-olds, they\u2019re like, hey, let\u2019s get together, let\u2019s go to the bar.\u201d\n\nBoth sexes are blind \u2013 they can only detect light and dark \u2013 so this foray across the open range each evening is filled with danger. That\u2019s one reason they team up. Predators like birds or tarantula hawk wasps are likely to only grab a few meaty tarantulas as snacks, and the rest can continue on their mission.\n\nBecause they spend most of their lives underground, tarantulas don\u2019t have many defenses, but they can bite or flick hair from their abdomens on to predators, causing itching and burning. When they\u2019re out in the world, it\u2019s a numbers game. The more they stick together, the more likely it is that one of the crew is going to score.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tarantula sightings have seemed high this year compared with previous mating seasons, said an expert. Photograph: US National Park Service\n\nUrban sounded mind-boggled by the difficulties they face, \u201cwithout a map, blind, at night, for miles, and you only have a certain number of days to do this before you\u2019re going to die\u201d.\n\n'Raining spiders': airborne arachnids appear over south-east Brazil Read more\n\nTo find a female in a burrow about a foot underground, the male tries to detect vibrations. If he somehow succeeds, he\u2019ll tiptoe in or knock on the web covering her burrow. His genitalia \u2013 known as a pedipalps \u2013 are right by his face, like two boxing gloves. \u201cThey use this glove-like apparatus to dispel sperm, and then it deflates like a balloon,\u201d says Urban. After laying down a layer of sperm over silk web, the male heads for the hills \u2013 because if he lingers, the female will usually eat him.\n\nDifferent species of tarantulas have developed ways of managing the fraught moment when the male encounters the female. \u201cSome do a dance to try to hypotonic the female so she doesn\u2019t strike,\u201d Urban explains. \u201cOthers will drum their pedipalps to create a beat. Some will literally do a dance routine that looks like the YMCA.\u201d As for the female? \u201cShe\u2019ll just sit there like, uh, really dude? And more times than not, he gets eaten.\u201d\n\nHer hunger sated, the female will deposit her eggs on the sperm mat and bundle it up into a waterproof cocoon. Around three months later, she will have up to 1,000 spiderlings.\n\nEven if the male isn\u2019t gobbled up, his days are numbered. Males typically die within six months of mating.\n\nFor a female, making eggs is so energy-intensive that once she makes her cocoon, she won\u2019t be able to do it again for another three years.\n\nTarantula sightings have seemed high this year compared with previous mating seasons, said Urban. Kim Kardashian West, who lives in Calabasas, California, posted photos to Instagram of three tarantulas she found in her garage. \u201cIt\u2019s mating season,\u201d she observed. Kardashian has been terrified by tarantulas on a previous occasion.\n\nEven if they\u2019re jolting to see, whether from excitement or fear, experts don\u2019t recommend picking one up \u2013 not because they will hurt people but because tarantulas have a thin exoskeleton and can be injured if they fall.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s nothing compared with being consumed after sex.", "description": "Males have begun their walkabout seeking a mate (and hoping not to get eaten) \u2013 and this year has seen a big turnout", "authors": ["Katharine Gammon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/661cc82c6a91c356a91c5b7cfe741154977be945/0_133_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf87fab4c5b886223a76c87ec4eb0811", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
