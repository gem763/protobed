Tulsi Gabbard, calling the Hawaii Democrat a \u201cuseful idiot\u201d and a \u201cTrojan horse.\u201d\n\nDuring a podcast interview last week, Clinton said Gabbard was a \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d and was being groomed \u201cto be the third-party candidate,\u201d offering no evidence to support her assertion. Gabbard, who is running a long-shot Democratic presidential campaign, quickly fired back, calling Clinton the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d while claiming the \u201ccorporate media and war machine\u201d were trying to destroy her reputation.\n\nHostin, meanwhile, sided entirely with the former first lady in this growing feud, stating Clinton has been \u201cdead-on about so many things.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told us about Russia, she told us about the probable interference,\u201d Hostin continued. \u201cShe was secretary of state. She has deep world knowledge of world issues. I thought, where\u2019s the lie? I\u2019ve often said that Tulsi is sort of the Trojan horse in this. She\u2019s polling at only 1.2 percent, yet she\u2019s still in the race. You have her being touted by people like Fox News personalities like Tucker Carlson.\u201d\n\nBehar would then join Hostin in noting that Gabbard has received endorsements from Russian-friendly media and white supremacist David Duke, asserting that while she\u2019s denounced Duke\u2019s support she hasn\u2019t distanced herself from Russia\u2019s praise of her.\n\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t denied it,\u201d Behar said of Gabbard\u2019s reaction to Clinton. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t said anything in her tweets. \u2018How dare you? It\u2019s outrageous. Of course, I\u2019m not.\u2019 She didn\u2019t say that. She\u2019s just going after Hillary.\u201d\n\nAdding that she doesn\u2019t believe Clinton wants to get back in the presidential race, Behar went on to say she also doesn\u2019t feel that Gabbard is a Russian \u201cagent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think that she could be a useful idiot the way Trump is a useful idiot to the Russians,\u201d the liberal co-host proclaimed. \u201cThat they see something. They say, \u2018Oh look, a useful idiot. Let\u2019s play this.\u2019\u201d\n\nBehar, meanwhile, insisted that Republicans absolutely need outside interference from Russia and voter suppression to win the upcoming election, before informing the audience that they\u2019ll be able to ask Gabbard about this soon as she\u2019s scheduled to come on The View in a couple of weeks.\n\nConservative co-host Abby Huntsman, for her part, said she saw this more as Clinton having an \u201cax to grind\u201d over 2016, while accusing Clinton of playing the Russians\u2019 game and being \u201cclueless.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want the Democratic Party to be divided,\u201d Huntsman continued. \u201cThey want more people to know Tulsi Gabbard and she was only promoted because of this. It surprised me Hillary Clinton was not smarter and more tactful in how she talked about it.\u201d\n\nHostin, however, didn\u2019t buy Huntsman\u2019s argument that Gabbard\u2019s isolationist foreign-policy views could resonate with many Democrats, pointing once more to the Hawaii lawmaker\u2019s low poll numbers. This prompted Huntsman to accuse Clinton of hurting her own party by smearing Gabbard.\n\n\u201cI love that she\u2019s playing that,\u201d Hostin concluded. \u201cShe can say what she wants.\u201d\n\n\u2018The View\u2019s\u2019 Meghan McCain Confronts Tulsi Gabbard for \u2018Spouting Propaganda from Syria\u2019\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
