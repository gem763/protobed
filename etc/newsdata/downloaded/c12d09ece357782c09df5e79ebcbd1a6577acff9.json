They predicted the Democratic victory in the 2018 midterms. And now the bettors on decentralization prediction market \u201cAugur\u201d think that President Donald Trump \u2026 might\u2014or might not\u2014be impeached.\n\nThat\u2019s right: they\u2019re split down the middle! It\u2019s a dead heat right now.\n\nAugur is run by a collective of distributed \u201creporters,\u201d who validate the outcomes of events in lieu of a centralized system. Bettors can gamble on anything without the restrictions levied on regulated markets, and governments supposedly can\u2019t do anything because the whole thing is decentralized.\n\nWith no limits on jurisdiction, nor the amount of money that can be deposited, Augur bets offer an insight into predictive groupthink. And it\u2019s no different with the latest Trump impeachment markets: On the platform\u2019s most voluminous Trump impeachment market, \u201cWill Donald Trump be impeached by the end of 2019,\u201d created in July, which has $13,000 at stake, it\u2019s a tossup:\n\nFifty-percent think yes, the other fifty-percent no. The site does not indicate how many people are involved in the betting so, caveat schmemptor! (Unless we simply failed to understand how the site works!)\n\nOn the other, more illiquid markets, Trump slam-dunks the venerable members of the various impeachment committees. A mere five percent believe Trump will be impeached before the end of his first term, on a market with roughly one grand at stake, while a slightly rosier 45 percent have answered \u201cno\u201d to the question, \u201cWill Donald John Trump, 45th president of the United States of America, be impeached by the United States House of Representatives during his first term?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s troubles treble, however, on centralized prediction market PredictIt, where bettors believe Trump will indeed be \u201cimpeached in his first term.\u201d The New Zealand-based PredictIt takes regular fiat currency and is subject to regulation in the United States; bets are capped below $1,000 to maintain PredictIt\u2019s status as a \u201cresearch\u201d project.\n\nThere could be some vagueness in the polling, to be teased out here. If Congress votes to impeach, it still needs the Senate to agree, and remove Trump from office. It\u2019s not clear whether Augur\u2019s market-makers intended \u201cconviction\u201d in the titles of their markets, and an ambiguous result could skew the results, invalidating the market. Augur was once famously hamstrung after a market on whether the weather was pleasant on Bastille Day failed to resolve after months of heated debate.\n\nSo, in summary, assuming the betting remains split: if Trump remains in office, everyone gets their money back. And if he gets thrown out on his ear...everyone gets their money back. Which is to say that, unlike in the real world, everyone is a winner.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Bettors on Prediction Market Augur, who are usually right about these things, have taken up the Trump Question.
