Instead, he appeared on Sky News to defend the reorganisation and sent Heneghan in his place.\n\nAbout 35 staff members working for the various organisations that make up People\u2019s Vote decided to walk out of the office in protest at Rudd\u2019s actions, with only a handful left in the building.\n\nThey were told by email that they should take the day off and regroup with Rudd on Tuesday. In an escalation of the tensions, one People\u2019s Vote source said Baldwin and McGrory had then been threatened with legal action for trespass.\n\nInfluential figures in the second referendum movement questioned the legitimacy of the sackings. Alastair Campbell, a former Labour spokesman and People\u2019s Vote campaigner, tweeted: \u201cBefore people get too excited, a few facts \u2026 @RolandRudd is chair of Open Britain. He styles himself as chair of PV but this has never been agreed by all.\u201d\n\nCampbell claimed Rudd did \u201cnot have the right\u201d to sack McGrory and Baldwin and appoint Heneghan as interim chief executive.\n\nStephen Dorrell, the chairman of European Movement UK, another organisation under the People\u2019s Vote umbrella, echoed Campbell in voicing concern about the legitimacy of the firings. He said: \u201cRoland Rudd is chair of Open Britain; the People\u2019s Vote campaign includes European Movement and other partners who were not consulted about untimely management changes in Open Britain.\u201d\n\nThe changes follow major disagreements within the People\u2019s Vote campaign that have been developing for months about the movement\u2019s direction and strategy.\n\nTension has stemmed from Rudd\u2019s desire to move the campaign towards a more pro-remain position, with the campaign directors focusing on winning over soft leave voters and undecided Labour and Conservative members of parliament.\n\nPlay Video 7:05 On the ground with People's Vote marchers: \u2018It\u2019s not done by a long way\u2019 \u2013 video\n\nBaldwin, who was previously Ed Miliband\u2019s spokesman, said Rudd did not have the authority to dismiss anyone.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s making the mistake that I think a lot of businessmen do when they dabble in politics, which is to think that because they have a certain title and a board they then own the campaign,\u201d Baldwin said. He said Rudd had made a \u201cgrotesque misjudgment\u201d by proceeding with a reorganisation at such a time.\n\nBaldwin added: \u201cThe clue\u2019s in the title \u2013 People\u2019s Vote campaign belongs to the people, not just one businessman who is hardly ever seen in the campaign. I think he\u2019s been in the office three or four times in the last 18 months. It\u2019s really not for him to tell the campaign what to do.\u201d\n\nAdding to the confusion, Rudd later appeared to argue that Baldwin had not been sacked, just moved so Heneghan could be the \u201cone person to be in charge\u201d.\n\nBaldwin \u201chas an opportunity for a different type of role, which is allowing one person to take up the reins and actually lead this thing\u201d, Rudd told the BBC\u2019s Today programme, saying they \u201cneed to have a proper, civilised chat about it\u201d.\n\nRudd said one issue had been criticism within the campaign of Labour and the Liberal Democrats: \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to write off any one particular party or any leadership.\u201d\n\nAs part of the power struggle, Rudd has formed a new company to oversee a remain campaign in the event of a second referendum, even though parliament is still some way off support for one.", "description": "Campaign in chaos after key figures say chairman had no right to order dismissals", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b8d097055c2211d923752ab7d62007fbad0d2a0/0_5_3481_2089/master/3481.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4e564e2f1a389666abe0197532d66e58", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
