The trend prompted NASCAR officials to take action last May with the $2 billion purchase of 12 racetracks from the International Speedway Corporation, in an apparent bid to gain more control over an event schedule that critics have deemed too rigorous.\n\nWhile NASCAR has lacked a true crossover marketing star since Dale Earnhardt Jr.\u2019s retirement in 2017, the sport\u2019s list of top-earning drivers is full of familiar faces. FOX Business breaks down the highest-paid stars below, according to Forbes\u2019 annual calculations.\n\nJimmie Johnson\n\n2018 earnings: $17.5 million\n\nA seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion, Johnson is arguably the sport\u2019s most recognizable active driver.

He has endorsement deals with Gatorade and Chevrolet.\n\nKyle Busch\n\n2018 earnings: $15.8 million\n\nBusch, 34, has 55 career wins in the NASCAR\u2019s main circuit and more than 200 career wins overall.
