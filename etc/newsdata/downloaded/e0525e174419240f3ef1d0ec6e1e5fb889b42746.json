Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) as a right-wing extremist, leading her to reiterate a threat to boycott Tuesday\u2019s Democrat debate, which the Times is co-sponsoring with CNN.\n\nThe Times article, \u201cWhat, Exactly, Is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?\u201c, claims that Gabbard is beloved by white nationalists, antisemites, and Russians attempting to interfere in the election, citing \u201csuspicious activity\u201d around her campaign.\n\nFor example, the article states:\n\nThen there is 4chan, the notoriously toxic online message board, where some right-wing trolls and anti-Semites fawn over Ms. Gabbard, calling her \u201cMommy\u201d and praising her willingness to criticize Israel. In April, the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, took credit for Ms. Gabbard\u2019s qualification for the first two Democratic primary debates.\u201d Brian Levin, the head of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino, said Ms. Gabbard had \u201cthe seal of approval\u201d within white nationalist circles. \u201cIf people have that isolationist worldview, there is one candidate that could best express them on each side: Gabbard on the Democratic side and Trump on the Republican side,\u201d Mr. Levin said.\n\nThe article also cites Gabbard\u2019s threat last Thursday to boycott the October presidential primary debate as evidence of her alleged appeal to the far right:\n\nThe questions [about Gabbard\u2019s right-wing sympathies] deepened on Thursday after Ms. Gabbard threatened to boycott Tuesday\u2019s debate, arguing that the corporate news media and the Democratic National Committee are working together to rig the event. (The New York Times is a co-sponsor of the debate with CNN.) \u2026 [I]t\u2019s also an argument that reminds some Democrats of the narrative pushed by Russian actors during the 2016 presidential contest, when an operation by internet trolls worked to manipulate American public opinion: that the electoral system is broken and cannot be trusted.\n\nIn response to the Times article, Gabbard reiterated her threat to boycott:\n\nAs if to prove my point, NYT just published a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d smear piece. All your favorite hits in one article! These are the folks who will be acting as the \u201cneutral\u201d questioners/moderators of Tuesday\u2019s debate lol \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 12, 2019\n\nGabbard failed to qualify for the third debate last month, but at the second presidential debate in Detroit, Michigan, in August, she damaged Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with strident \u2014 and true \u2014 accusations that the former California prosecutor had put thousands of non-violent marijuana users behind bars and initially opposed the use of DNA evidence that might exonerate a death row inmate.\n\nGabbard, a major in the U.S. Army National Guard, is also known for her strong views against armed intervention abroad, particularly in Syria. A Samoan-American, Gabbard is also the first Hindu elected to the U.S. Congress.\n\nShe supported \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the 2016 election, famously quitting the Democratic National Committee (DNC) over its unfair treatment of Sanders in favor of Hillary Clinton.\n\nJoel B.
