Lighting will be dimmed, in-store radios turned off, checkout volumes lowered, trolley collection and shelf-stocking kept to a bare minimum, and no PA announcements broadcast except in emergencies, said general manage Kiri Hannifin.\n\nAn employee who has a son with autism suggested the idea, and after a year of trialling the concept in selected stores the supermarket giant has now adopted it for its 180 stores.\n\n\u201cWe want our supermarkets to be welcoming and inclusive for all New Zealanders and their families. We know grocery shopping can be an anxiety-inducing experience for some customers and we wanted to help with that,\u201d said Hannifin.\n\nWomen 'better than men at disguising autism symptoms' Read more\n\n\u201cThe lovely thing about quiet hour is that we have had very positive feedback from so many customers. Our older customers seem to really enjoy quiet hours too, as well as many other Kiwis who actually just find shopping a bit stressful and can now visit at a more peaceful time.\u201d\n\nDane Dougan, Autism New Zealand\u2019s chief executive, said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d about the introduction of quiet hour, and said it would make a meaningful difference in the lives of people dealing with the condition.\n\n\u201cIt highlights how some small changes can create a more inclusive environment that will impact people significantly,\u201d Dougan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had amazing feedback from the autistic community who have benefited from quiet hour over the last year and the increased understanding of autism and sensory needs that it is having as well.\u201d", "description": "Countdown will reduce lighting, radio and PA announcements and shelf stacking", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1628f710bcaac34728f966e177b54d24eab07c0e/0_213_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=342ce6c8df3ce01743773a4d915570bd", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
