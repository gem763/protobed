They said they launched 10 drones with \u201cintelligence cooperation from people inside Saudi Arabia\u201d, according to the rebel-run Saba news agency. The rebels\u2019 spokesman Yahya Saree said their operations \u201cwill expand and would be more painful as long as the Saudi regime continues its aggression and blockade\u201d on Yemen, he said.The fires are now under control at both facilities, Saudi state media said.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s oil fields and pipeline have been the target of rebel attacks over the past year, often using single drones, but analysts said this appeared to be the biggest and most successful to date.\n\nThe attack has raised tensions in the Persian Gulf. Houthi rebels are assisted by Iran, which has developed sophisticated drones. But US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said last night there was no evidence the strike came from Yemen and accused Iran of launching an \u201cunprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply\u201d.\n\nAbqaiq, run by state-owned firm Aramco, is described as the world\u2019s most important processing centre, where crude from several of the country\u2019s largest oil fields is sent before being shipped for export.\n\nThe attack reduced production by five million barrels a day \u2013 nearly half the kingdom\u2019s output and 5% of global production \u2013 according to unnamed Saudi oil ministry sources quoted by the Reuters news agency last night. The reduction will go on for at least 48 hours reports said.\n\n\u201cAbqaiq is the heart of the system; it just had a heart attack,\u201d said Roger Diwan, oil consultant at IHS Markit. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know the severity.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was called by President Donald Trump after the attack to express US support for Saudi security, the Saudi foreign ministry said. Andrew Murrison, the British foreign office minister responsible for the Middle East, called on the Houthis to stop threatening civilian areas and Saudi commercial infrastructure.\n\nRobert McNally, of the US-based Rapidan Energy Group, said: \u201cAbqaiq is perhaps the most critical facility in the world for oil supply. Oil prices will jump on this. If disruption to production is prolonged, a Strategic Petrol Reserves release from International Energy Agency members seems both likely and sensible. If anything, the risk of tit-for-tat regional escalation, which pushes oil prices even higher, has just gone up significantly.\u201d\n\nThe IEA said it was \u201cmonitoring the situation closely\u201d. A spokesman added: \u201cWe are in contact with Saudi authorities as well as major producer and consumer nations. For now, markets are well supplied.\u201d", "description": "Explosions halve Saudi output and reduce global production by 5%", "authors": ["David Connett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94670a2a07d42d4afc77499bf6b3acb0167214fe/91_0_2223_1334/master/2223.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4449fb28b73b2a3476c43c385537ca44", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
