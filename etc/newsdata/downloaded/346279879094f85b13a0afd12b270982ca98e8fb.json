He belonged out there and he looked confident from the first touch of the ball. Over the 90 minutes, do debuts get better than that?'\n\nMatty Longstaff said he was 'over the moon' after his debut winner over Manchester United\n\nGraeme Souness applauded the impact of the Newcastle star after stepping onto the big stage\n\nLongstaff celebrated wildly at St James Park where he has come through the Toon academy\n\nLongstaff was taken aback by his instant impact and remarked on how his sudden changing of fortunes felt so surreal, especially as he was only told he would be playing on Saturday (the day before the game).\n\n'I\u2019m a bit in awe to be honest,' he commented. 'You go to bed dreaming of this and you never think it's going to happen.\n\n'For it to happen, I'm over the moon. I\u2019m a bit speechless.'\n\nAfter hitting the crossbar in the first half, Longstaff's winner came in the 72nd minute as the ginger-haired midfielder struck home a fierce low strike from just outside the box.\n\nLongstaff's 20-yard strike has relieved some of the pressure on Newcastle boss Steve Bruce\n\nAfter hitting the crossbar in the first half, Longstaff's winner came in the 72nd minute as the ginger-haired midfielder struck home a fierce low strike from just outside the box.\n\nHe was joined in the Newcastle midfield by older brother Sean Longstaff as Newcastle recorded just their second league win of the season.\n\n'I'm over the moon for him,\"Sean said. \"If I'm being honest, he's been unlucky to be out of the team. But today he's been a breath of fresh air.\n\n'It was great, you look how lively he is, he gets around the pitch and makes my job much easier.\n\n'Usually he's bouncing around the house but last night he was the quietest I've ever seen him. He was outstanding and deserves all the credit he's going to get.'\n\nThe result leaves Manchester United just two points above the relegation zone on eight points - the Red Devils' lowest points tally since 1989-90.", "description": "Newcastle ran out 1-0 victors over Manchester United on Sunday at St James Park and former Liverpool midfielder Souness was left very impressed by what he saw of 19-year-old Longstaff.", "authors": ["Michael Boniface For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/19/19368288-0-image-a-117_1570387524138.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
