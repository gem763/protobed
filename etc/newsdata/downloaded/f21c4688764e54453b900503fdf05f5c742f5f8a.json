In front of a crowd questionably tabbed at 57,000 by the UFC (which conveniently just so happens to be a smidge ahead of the record set by the promotion\u2019s last stadium visit to Melbourne at UFC 193), De Castro knocked Brisbane, Australia\u2019s Tafa cold with one shot.\n\nTafa (3-1 MMA, 0-1 UFC) was charging forward, only to run straight into a massive right to the jaw that ended the main-card opener at Marvel Stadium in 2 minutes, 10 seconds.\n\nWatch this (via Twitter):\n\nWe suspect we\u2019re going to see a lot more of this before De Castro\u2019s time in the UFC is up. We also suspect he\u2019ll head back home with an extra $50,000 to his name.\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space. We don\u2019t take it overly serious, and neither should you. If you come complaining to us that something you read here is not hard-hitting news, expect to have the previous sentence repeated in ALL CAPS.", "description": "The bigger they come, the harder they fall.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "The Blue Corner", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Blue Corner", "Ken Hathaway", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/yorgan-de-castro-justin-tafa-ufc-243-tbc.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
