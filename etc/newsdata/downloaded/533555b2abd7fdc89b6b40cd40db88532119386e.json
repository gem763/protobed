The United Nations says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine that on the one hand you are trying to seek to have a trade deal, on the other hand you are making use of any issues, especially human rights issues, to blame the others,\" China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun told reporters.\n\nHe said there was \"progress\" in the trade talks.
