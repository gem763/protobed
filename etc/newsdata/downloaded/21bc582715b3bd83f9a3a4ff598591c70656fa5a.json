But Johnson had hit on a basic truth about Varadkar. He is not a typical Irish politician.\n\nThe gay son of an Indian immigrant, a trained medical doctor, and socially awkward, the taoiseach does not fit the usual mould.\n\nInstead of gladhanding constituents and attending funerals, two traditional elements of Ireland\u2019s parish pump politics, Varadkar prefers to read policy papers and strategise with aides. He is, in other words, that person mocked by Johnson: a swot.\n\nYet when the two met in north-west England on Thursday, in private, away from journalists and the usual panoply of summitry, Johnson was forced to look up to Varadkar, both literally and metaphorically.\n\nThe taoiseach is 1.93m ( 6ft 4in) and stands on the shoulders of the European Union \u2013 its commission, council, parliament and all 27 member states.\n\nThe Irish government\u2019s success in mobilising the EU behind the border backstop has rebalanced Ireland\u2019s historically subservient relationship with Britain.\n\nYet Varadkar, like Johnson, is under immense pressure. If the UK leaves the EU with no deal it will hammer Ireland\u2019s economy and destabilise Northern Ireland. But accepting a tweaked version of Downing Street\u2019s current plan, or some other plan that weakens the backstop, could torpedo Varadkar\u2019s hopes of winning Ireland\u2019s looming election.\n\nThe taoiseach would have got straight down to business.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a lot of time for, or interest in, small talk,\u201d said Brendan O\u2019Shea, a doctor who trained Varadkar as a medical student. \u201cWe have someone who is forensic about what he thinks should be done. The calculating machine will make a decision about what is the best decision then the politician will switch on and figure out a way to sell that.\u201d\n\nGrowing up as a GP\u2019s son in a middle-class Dublin suburb, young Leo declared, at the age of eight, an ambition to become health minister.\n\nA biography says that, as a teenager on a school trip to Northern Ireland, the future taoiseach smuggled fireworks back into the republic, which some might consider a metaphor for his role in Brexit.\n\nVaradkar studied medicine at Trinity College Dublin and joined Fine Gael, a centre-right party. Outspoken about tax cuts and welfare reform, some called him \u201cTory boy\u201d. His heroes included Otto von Bismarck and Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary.\n\nAs a Teachta D\u00e1la (member of the Irish parliament) and minister, Varadkar earned a reputation for energy, direct language and social stiffness \u2013 some public interactions left aides cringing.\n\nJohnson\u2019s bonhomie, however, may not be totally wasted on Varadkar, who has loosened up since coming out as gay in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that defines me,\u201d the then health minister told RT\u00c9. \u201cI\u2019m not a half-Indian politician, or a doctor politician or a gay politician for that matter. It\u2019s just part of who I am.\u201d\n\nIt was a brave admission \u2013 Ireland had yet to legalise same-sex marriage. The response was overwhelmingly positive and Varadkar went on to succeed Enda Kenny as leader of Fine Gael and taoiseach in 2017, and in the process to go from Mars bar binger to fitness fanatic.\n\n\u201cComing out changes everybody,\u201d said Tiernan Brady, an LGBT activist who advised Varadkar. \u201cIn accepting who you are to yourself, and that you can still go on to lead your party and your country, that\u2019s been really affirming. That brings you a whole level of confidence.\u201d\n\nSome Irish backstop sceptics warn that Varadkar\u2019s government may be suffering from over-confidence, that bending Brussels to Dublin\u2019s agenda may backfire, and that the broad national consensus behind the strategy may deter the taoiseach from compromising.\n\n\u201cVaradkar\u2019s personal political interests have diverted from the national interest,\u201d said Dan O\u2019Brien, the chief economist at the Institute of International and European Affairs. \u201cHis political career could be ended by making a concession on the backstop. Fianna F\u00e1il and Sinn F\u00e9in would come down on him like a tonne of bricks. It\u2019s never a good idea for a leader to be painted into a corner.\u201d", "description": "The gay son of an Indian immigrant has rebalanced his country\u2019s relationship with Britain", "authors": ["Rory Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18961522e48ef3892c8c763f400a0669efc90ded/0_98_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cac6eca5b8619ca5bd72fc0c90c84d25", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
