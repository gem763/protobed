We're simmering nicely, says England's Daly", "language": "en", "text": "OITA, Japan (Reuters) - England have rubbished suggestions that a two-week break before their World Cup quarter-final against Australia has left them undercooked, with coaches having to step in to cool things down at a white-hot training session on Tuesday.\n\nEngland's rugby player Elliot Daly speaks during a news conference ahead of their Rugby World Cup match against Tonga in Sapporo, Japan, September 19, 2019. REUTERS/Edgar Su/Files\n\nWith their final pool game against France cancelled at the weekend due to the approach of Typhoon Hagibis, England will face the Wallabies on Saturday not having played since Oct. 5 when they beat Argentina 39-10.\n\nEven that game, which came on the back of comfortable wins over Tonga and the United States, was pretty straightforward after an early red card took the sting out of the Pumas.\n\nWhile some have seized on the long layoff as a possible weakness in their preparations, fullback Elliot Daly said the squad were \u201cfiring\u201d after full-on training sessions.\n\n\u201cIt was good to get training as quickly as possible. To get down there (short-term base in Miyazaki) and have a good three days to make sure we are ready for this week, firing, was what we needed to do,\u201d he told a news conference on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe way we train is to mimic games and the way we have trained over the last three or four weeks especially and playing games at the weekend has gone really well for us.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of energy on the training pitch. We had to rein it back a bit today because the boys were getting a bit too excited. That is the overarching theme for everybody - excited to see where we can take this.\u201d\n\nNumber eight Billy Vunipola took part in that session and looks to be recovering well from his sprained ankle, but winger Jack Nowell missed out and is a doubt for the game.\n\nAssistant coach John Mitchell said it was very likely Vunipola would be fit.\n\n\u201cHe is a very important player to us,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cHe loves to get the ball in his hands and he is very good at regaining and retaining momentum.\u201d\n\nShould Vunipola not make it, Mark Wilson, named England\u2019s player of the series after the November internationals where he chiefly played at the back of the scrum, is the likely replacement.\n\nDespite heading into the match on the back of six successive wins against the Wallabies, Mitchell said he was in no doubt that they would bring something unexpected to the party in a bid to end that streak.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, having witnessed a number of teams play against Australia and also played against them myself as a youngster, they have always been highly intellectual in the way that they play the game and have always been clever and it something that I respect,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cThey always have the ability to surprise. The love ball in their hands which is something which they thrive on. \u201c\n\nFrench referee Jerome Garces will referee the game, tournament officials announced on Tuesday.", "description": "England have rubbished suggestions that a two-week break before their World Cup quarter-final against Australia has left them undercooked, with coaches having to step in to cool things down at a white-hot training session on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441017605&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0EP", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
