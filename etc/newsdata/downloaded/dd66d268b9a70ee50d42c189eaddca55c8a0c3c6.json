Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, to come to the city to talk about gun violence, while vocal Trump critic Alyssa Milano is scheduled to meet with Cruz about gun reform this week.\n\n\"People are saying, 'This is getting so out of hand.' Just because you don't agree with someone politically, it doesn't mean they're horrible people. It goes for both parties. I think the new thing is going to be being accepting and talking,\" Kilmeade said.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCo-host Steve Doocy said there seems to be a \"Trump derangement syndrome\" in the country since 2016, and \"everybody is dug in\" when it comes to their political beliefs.", "description": "\"Fox & Friends\" co-host Brian Kilmeade said Monday that he believes a \"breaking point\" may have been reached when it comes to Hollywood's shunning of Trump supporters.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/friends.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
