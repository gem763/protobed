Eight months after coming to the University of Liverpool she was dead.\"\n\nHe added: \"If we had known how Ceara was suffering we could have, and would have, made a difference.\"\n\nMr Thacker said it was \"essential\" universities communicated \"effectively with healthcare services and, where appropriate, with families to ensure they are kept safe\".\n\nMs Thacker's mother Lorraine Dalton-Thacker, 51, said: \"At every turn, she was failed.\n\n\"I can't imagine how frightening that must have been for her.\n\n\"She should not have had to face this and it breaks our hearts that she did.\n\n\"We don't want any other family to go through this pain.\"\n\nImage caption Ms Thacker started university in September 2017 to study philosophy\n\nMs Bhardwaj said she would make a report for the prevention of future deaths to the NHS.\n\nShe will recommend the issue of parental involvement, with consent, is included in mental health assessments.\n\nThe coroner said there was no record of discussions between medical professionals and Ms Thacker about contacting her family.\n\n\"It would have been helpful to have those discussions, so if Ceara wanted additional support from her family that could have been facilitated,\" she added.\n\nHowever, it remained \"difficult and unclear\" whether Ms Thacker \"would have had a different outcome had she had additional mental health appointments, been given an urgent appointment and had family involvement\", the coroner said.\n\nThe court heard the two-month delay in getting a mental health appointment was caused by \"exceptional circumstances\" including strike action, staff sickness and training days.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBBC education editor Branwen Jeffreys\n\nFor several years universities have been struggling to cope with a sharp increase in students seeking help for mental health issues.\n\nSuicide among university students is rare; it is estimated by the Office for National Statistics at 4.7 deaths per 100,000 students, but each loss is felt deeply by families and they are pressing for change.\n\nSpending on support on campus has increased. Ten universities have received national funding to try new approaches. As a result the University of Liverpool is leading a project on how to work better with the NHS.\n\nThe University of Bristol asks every student when they register to give permission for their family to be contacted. Last year 94% signed up for the mental health alerts to parents.\n\nThis is a change that Iain Thacker wants widely adopted.\n\nLiverpool has chosen a different approach; asking students if they want family informed only when they are seeking help.\n\nStudents are young adults and have a right to confidentiality and, as yet, there is no consensus across universities about how to respect that and manage risk.\n\nGavin Brown, Liverpool University's pro-vice-chancellor for education, said: \"We have conducted a thorough review of the support Ceara was offered and, as a result of this and our ongoing review of how these services work, we have instigated a number of improvements to mental health support services.\"\n\nDr Paul Redmond, Director of Student Experience added that the university had introduced a rapid access appointment system since the student's death.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with issues raised by this story, find support through BBC Action Line.", "description": "Ceara Thacker, 19, was failed by mental health services before killing herself, her parents say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E316/production/_108843185_ebb4338e-4dfa-40b3-834c-9ea565497d1b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
