Our significant investment in training employees to innovate will be a game-changer as Kmart Group is set to become one of the world's first major retailers to have all IT staff certified in cloud technologies,\" Kmart Group CTO Michael Fagan said.\n\n\"We are using new technology to increase efficiency and achieve scale, which was previously impossible. For example, we are now able to leverage AWS data platforms, including RedShift, to gain better and faster insights about our products and their demand across our network.\"\n\nWith the new initiative, Kmart Group joins other Australian businesses that have implemented an AWS Cloud Skills Guild-style training program, including Insurance Australia Group, Australia Post, and the National Australia Bank (NAB).\n\nThe bank in April last year stood up the NAB Cloud Guild, an internal program that offers AWS skills training.\n\nNAB executive general manager for infrastructure, cloud, and workplace Steven Day told ZDNet in May that senior leadership were also undertaking training, specifically around the business side of cloud.\n\n\"We really saw there was a gap there, so this was an opportunity to bring them into the fold,\" he said.\n\n\"What we have been able to do is move NAB into a pretty exciting place to be if you're a cloud developer.\"\n\nThe red and black bank's Cloud Guild has now trained more than 4,500 people from across the organisation, with NAB calling it a \"huge success\" with helping the bank's workforce understand the power of cloud technology and how it can help solve problems and be able to innovate.\n\nAWS IN AUSTRALIA", "description": "Staff will pick up skills in cloud, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/24/bbdce4b2-91dd-4d61-8179-7fb16b715209/thumbnail/770x578/d0348cefbde549007bba415798e1678f/kmartamazon-30.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
