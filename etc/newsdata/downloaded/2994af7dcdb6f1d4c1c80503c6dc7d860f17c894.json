Apple (AAPL) benefited, as it was perceived as a safe haven away from the aggressive valuations, and underperforming small-caps did well as money managers tried to find some undiscovered value plays.\n\nThe computer algorithms pushed the indices to a strong close for the second day in a row and Thursday morning, there is further strength on several news items dealing with China trade. Both sides are marking efforts to show good will in front of negotiations next month. The U.S. is delaying the imposition of tariffs for a couple of weeks and China is making promises that it will purchase more agricultural produces.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is reporting that China is looking to separate \"national security\" issues, which mainly are related to 5G giant Huawei, from the pure trade issues. This has been one of the main stumbling blocks as it was framed as a precondition to continued discussion.\n\nFutures have faded after jumping overnight, but are still in positive territory. Market players have seen these headlines on trade too often to trust them and no one expects a trade deal to come quickly. The incremental good news keeps the bears at bay and provides computer-driven pops, but real progress on trade is mostly a mirage.\n\nThere are two big questions for market players to confront at this point. The first is whether the recent rotational action is over or whether there will be another bout of positioning as we head into the end of the third quarter. Major funds have suddenly found it prudent to shift allocations out of more-expensive stocks -- and usually that sort of move doesn't end that easily due to the sheer size of capital that is involved. Momentum stocks found some support yesterday, but they are not snapping back to any great degree so far.\n\nThe second issue that the market must contend with is the reaction to the Fed rate cut that is expected to occur next Wednesday. The cut is about as certain as things ever are and many market players are wondering to what degree it has already been discounted by the market. The market seems to celebrate Fed dovishness even when it is well known and anticipated, but the central banks are not driving the same sort of optimism that they have previously.\n\nThe move yesterday put the indices in good technical condition and the calming action under the surface shored up sentiment. One particularly positive development is the relative strength in small-cap stocks, which is welcome for stock pickers trying to find some new inventory.\n\nWe have good news on China trade, healthy technical patterns in the indices and a positive open. We will need to watch for more rotation action to occur but it has slowed for now.", "description": "We have good news on China trade, healthy technical patterns in the indices and a positive open....AAPL", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "China Trade", "Central Banks", "Sector Rotation Can'T Stop The Bulls", "We Have Good News On China Trade", "Healthy Technical Patterns In The Indices", "A Positive Open.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Stephen Guilfoyle"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/89825fdd-cf1b-11e9-805f-c999171b6996.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
