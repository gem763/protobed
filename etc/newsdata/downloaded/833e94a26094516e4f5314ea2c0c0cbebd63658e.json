Strapped British travellers on the trail of culture should head to Eastern Europe, new research has found.\n\nAccording to the recently released annual Cost of Culture Report from Post Office Travel Money, Budapest has the best value cultural offerings out of 18 cities examined.\n\nThe 2019 report looked at the cost of six different activities in each city, including opera, theatre, museums, galleries and heritage sites. Budapest was found to be the cheapest for the second year running, coming in at \u00a370 total.\n\nFor just \u00a370, Budapest city-goers can cram in trips to the Hungarian National Museum, National Gallery and Matthias Church, plus tickets for performances in Erkel Theatre and the National Concert Hall.\n\nThis came to less than a fifth of the price of culture in the most expensive European cities. For the same number of attractions, visitors pay \u00a3377 in Milan and \u00a3430 in Madrid.\n\nMatthias church is as beautiful as it is good value Credit: getty More\n\nRunners-up Prague (\u00a3102) and Warsaw (\u00a3105) made Eastern Europe the stand out winner for wallet-friendly culture.\n\nThis information is especially relevant given that city breaks are the most popular type of overseas holiday for Britons, and a large portion decide their destination primarily on the strength of its culture\n\nNick Boden from Post Office Travel Money said that while over two-in-five holidaymakers planning city breaks rated cultural attractions as a key consideration when choosing where to go, more than three-quarters said they are \u201cconcerned about the costs they will face\u201d.\n\nThe total price of six cultural attractions in each city analysed:\n\nBudapest (\u00a370)\n\nPrague (\u00a3102)\n\nWarsaw (\u00a3105)\n\nStockholm (\u00a3159)\n\nMoscow (\u00a3161)\n\nDublin (\u00a3173)\n\nBrussels (\u00a3174)\n\nBerlin (\u00a3214)\n\nRome (\u00a3216)\n\nParis (\u00a3241)\n\nAmsterdam (\u00a3253)\n\nBarcelona (\u00a3274)\n\nCopenhagen (\u00a3275)\n\nLondon (\u00a3288)\n\nVienna (\u00a3289)\n\nMilan (\u00a3377)\n\nNew York (\u00a3418)\n\nMadrid (\u00a3430)\n\n\u201cWith the wide variation in prices we found this year, it will really pay to do some homework on local costs before making a decision,\u201d Boden added.\n\n\u201cPrices fluctuate from year to year, especially for opera, ballet and music concerts, where they can rise or fall dramatically depending on who is performing and the stature of the venue.\u201d\n\nVibrant Warsaw is full of low-cost culture Credit: getty More\n\nIn Moscow, for instance, autumn prices are significantly lower in the city this year. This comes in spite of sterling's 8 per cent year-on-year fall against the Russian ruble.\n\nThe overall price of six experiences in Moscow dropped 30 per cent from last year to \u00a3161, thanks to the Bolshoi Ballet performing on the New Stage. A ticket came in at under half the price of the previous year\u2019s production on the more expensive Bolshoi Historic Stage: \u00a363.25 instead of \u00a3132.22. A ticket to a National Philharmonic concert in Tchaikovsky Hall also halved to \u00a316.15.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Planning a city break on a budget?
