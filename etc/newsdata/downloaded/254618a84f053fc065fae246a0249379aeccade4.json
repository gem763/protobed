Some lawmakers are insisting, however, that Olaechea is the real president because he is third in the constitutional line of succession.\n\nVizcarra recently urged Congress to implement a new safeguard against corruption in the appointment of justices to the Constitutional Tribunal, the court that has the power to try federal civil servants. He proposed to make it necessary that the executive branch give a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d when the opposition-controlled Congress appointed a judge. Congress rejected the idea, arguing that the power to appoint judges is solely a legislative power.\n\nThe Peruvian president recommended the measure in light of a years-long, sprawling investigation into corruption in the highest levels of power of most South American states, beginning with Brazil. Prosecutors have credibly accused dozens of politicians of taking bribes from the Brazilian contracting firm Odebrecht. Odebrecht would request that politicians grant the company infrastructure contracts at exorbitantly high prices and kick back some of the extra money in bribes to ensure the contracts would keep coming.\n\nIn Brazil, the investigation into this corruption is known as \u201cOperation Car Wash\u201d and resulted in the arrest of dozens of politicians, including socialist former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\nOdebrecht has ensnared politicians in a dozen countries, including Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, and Peru. Keiko Fujimori, the head of the conservative Popular Force party, is currently in prison over allegedly taking Odebrecht bribes.\n\nVizcarra became president last year after then-head-of-state Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned following the publication of videos seeming to show him attempting to buy off legislators. The videos were published in a political revenge attack by Fujimori against her brother, former lawmaker Kenji, who was implicated in the Kuczynski scheme. Kenji resigned from Popular Force in protest of his sister\u2019s alleged corruption.\n\nBoth Fujimoris are the children of Alberto Fujimori, president of Peru in the 1990s known for eliminating Shining Path, a deadly Marxist terrorist group. Fujimori, now in his 80s, is serving time in prison over alleged human rights violations during his tenure.\n\nPeru has also sent to prison former socialist President Ollanta Humala for Odebrecht corruption and attempted to try former president Alan Garc\u00eda. Garc\u00eda shot himself in April when members of the Brazilian prosecution team came to his home in Peru.\n\nVizcarra made the case that allies of politicians arrested on Odebrecht charges should not have the unchecked power to appoint judges who can exonerate them.\n\n\u201cThis is about fighting corruption, protection, and immunity used to secure impunity,\u201d Vizcarra said this week in demanding a check on Congress\u2019s appointment power. \u201cBehind the demand for transparency for the [appointment of] Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s magistrates are millions of Peruvians.\u201d\n\nCongress refused, so Vizcarra used what he believes is his constitutional powers to dissolve the legislature on Monday and call for new elections on January 26, 2020. Article 134 of the Peruvian Constitution allows the dissolution of the Congress if the president \u201chas censured or lost his trust in two members of the Council of Ministers.\u201d The Permanent Commission replaces Congress until elections can be held, no later than four months from the dissolution of Congress.\n\nCongress replied to the dissolution by calling the move unconstitutional and demanding access to their offices, now denied. They also attempted to swear in Vice President Ar\u00e1oz as the head of state. She accepted, but resigned shortly thereafter on Tuesday, stating that she would wait for a decision from the Constitutional Tribunal on the legality of Vizcarra\u2019s move.\n\nVicente Zeballos, the president of Peru\u2019s council of ministers, said on Wednesday that Vizcarra has no intention of resigning or backing down on his dissolution of Congress. He added that, because the lawmakers who tried to appoint Ar\u00e1oz president had already lost their seats to the dissolution when they tried to appoint her, their actions were invalid, as is her resignation, and Vizcarra still considers her the legal vice president.\n\nSome members of the Popular Force party are refusing to see Vizcarra as president or accept their removal from power, instead stating that Olaechea, the head of the Congress, is the true president.\n\n\u201cGiven the position that Congress has in the republic, constitutional succession [says] that the presidency belongs to Pedro Olaechea and he should call a general election,\u201d Rosa Bartra, a Popular Force lawmaker, said on Wednesday.\n\nOlaechea has not contested the presidency.\n\n\u201cFor the moment, I am the president of the Permanent Commission,\u201d he said, convening that commission on Wednesday.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "President Mart\u00edn Vizcarra of Peru dissolved the nation's Congress on Monday after it denied him the power to check judicial appointments.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Mart\u00edn-Vizcarra-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
