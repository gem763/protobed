But the North's hardball attitude in past months have raised doubts on whether Kim Jong Un would ever voluntarily give away his nukes he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival.\n\nNorth Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.", "description": "Nuclear negotiations have faltered after the collapse of a February summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump where the U.S. side rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a piecemeal deal toward partially surrendering its nuclear capabilities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106002643-1562224527310gettyimages-1152948604.jpeg?v=1570161593", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
