What does America stand for? A bunch of immigrants,\u201d Rihanna, who was born Robyn Fenty in Saint Michael, Barbados, said of the clip in the interview.\n\n\u201cThe fact that his defense was talking about Europeans coming into America?\u201d Rihanna continued. \u201cI mean, not only were you immigrants, you were the worst kind. You came in and murdered the real Americans.\u201d\n\nRihanna was referring to remarks Cuccinelli made during an interview in August, in which he said that the inscription on the Statue of Liberty welcoming immigrants to the United States was intended for \u201cpeople coming from Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell of course that poem referred back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies,\u201d Cuccinelli said of the inscription then. \u201cWhere people were considered wretched if they weren't in the right class.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it was introduced \u2014 it was written one year \u2014 one year after the first federal public charge rule was written that says \u2014 and I'll quote it, 'Any person unable to take care of himself without becoming a public charge,\u2019 would be inadmissible or in the terms that my agency deals with, they can't do what's called adjusting status, getting a green card becoming legal permanent residence,\u201d he continued.\n\nCuccinelli's comments came days as he defended a policy rolled out by the Trump administration that makes it easier to reject green cards for those deemed likely to depend on public assistance.\n\nWhile on the topic of immigration in the interview, Aguirre also asked Rihanna about a T-shirt she wore on Independence Day earlier this year that had the word \u201cIMMIGRANT\u201d written on the back.\n\nAguirre wrote that she then asked Rihanna if she had \u201canything to say to young immigrants living through this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Rihanna responded. \u201cWhat can you say? It\u2019s gonna get better? I almost feel sick to my stomach.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even believe this is happening in real life. In front of my eyes. In front of the world. It\u2019s not even hidden. This is blatant,\u201d Rihanna added.", "description": "Famed singer Rihanna blasted Ken Cuccinelli, the acting head of U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/rihanna_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
