All we know so far is that he will give tax breaks to wealthy men and is prepared to allow us to crash out of the EU without a deal.\n\nIt\u2019s really quite remarkable how Johnson will waltz into No 10 in just a few week\u2019s time with nothing more than a haircut and a serious gagging order from his campaign team. This is a time of national emergency. We need to register our protest \u2013 and fast.\n\nIn the absence of any genuine engagement with policy, all we have to go on is his record in public office: as a journalist, Johnson has sexualised and infantilised women as well as displaying blatantly colonial sentiment. I need not list the countless columns which demonstrate his archaic approach to women. As an MP, he has been absent for votes on abortion and gay marriage while sponsoring sexist austerity cuts and welfare reform. As foreign secretary, he cosied up to Saudi Arabia and Singapore, putting human rights and women\u2019s rights second to arms deals and tax havens.\n\nFor all of us concerned with gender equality, Johnson\u2019s track record raises serious red flags about how, as prime minister, he can possibly confront the enduring problem of gender inequality and social injustice.\n\nSpoiler: he probably won\u2019t.\n\nWhen I co-founded the Women\u2019s Equality Party four years ago, I knew we were needed then but I hadn't realised the situation was about to deteriorate. Our NHS is in tatters, our welfare system is failing and we are so paralysed by Brexit that children are having to take centre stage in fighting climate change. If you think a Boris Johnson's premiership and a no-deal Brexit is going to help things, I believe you\u2019re seriously mistaken. If we have learnt anything from a decade of austerity, it\u2019s that when the economy tanks, it is the public services which women rely on most which take the biggest hit.\n\nBehind the \"class clown\" act, Johnson\u2019s insidious sexism is a dangerous threat to women\u2019s rights. Ironically, he\u2019s the very character that the European Union was designed to counteract, with its long-standing commitment to women's working rights and gender equality.\n\nFrom equal pay for equal work to shared parental leave to anti-discrimination laws, much of the legislation that promotes gender equality began in Brussels. While we\u2019ve been busy arguing about Brexit they have been introducing the Work Life Balance Directive which implements paid carers leave to help close the gender pay gap.\n\nFor me the choice is starker than ever: a sexist Boris Johnson Brexit, or a bright future in Europe combined with a serious effort to heal the country.\n\nSo, on Saturday, let\u2019s welcome the new prime minister with a resounding cry of disapproval. He\u2019s no prime minister of ours \u2013 and this is no Brexit of ours, either.\n\nSandi Toksvig is a broadcaster, comedian, author and co-founder of the Women's Equality Party", "description": "By day, I\u2019m a comedian.
