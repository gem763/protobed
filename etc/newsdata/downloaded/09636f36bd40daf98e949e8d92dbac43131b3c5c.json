Greenpeace/Yonhap via REUTERS\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - Greenpeace campaigners climbed a 40-metre billboard advertisement for Hyundai Motor\u2019s near its head office in South Korea to post a sign reading \u201cNo more internal combustion engines\u201d, the environmental group said on Monday.\n\nPolice said they were investigating the group on suspicion of defacing the advertisement for a sedan next to a busy expressway in the capital, Seoul.\n\nGreenpeace spokesman Sean Lee said the group wanted to send a message to Hyundai Motor that eliminating internal combustion engines was \u201cno longer a matter of choice\u201d.\n\nThe sign, visible to travellers making their way home to Seoul on Sunday along the busy expressway after a long holiday weekend, was later taken down.\n\nHyundai, which together with its affiliate Kia Motors, are the world\u2019s fifth-largest automaker by sales, reported the incident to the police for investigation, a police official said by telephone.\n\nHyundai had no immediate comment.\n\nClimate groups like Greenpeace have been stepping up their action around the world against car makers developing big, heavy cars and vehicles with internal combustion engines.\n\nPolice said a person responsible for defacing the billboard could face up to three years in prison or a 7 million won (nearly $6,000) fine for property damage, the police official said.\n\nLee In-sung, a Greenpeace Seoul office campaigner handling legal affairs, said the group was aware of the possible criminal charges but it would carry on with its non-violent action \u201cperhaps in a different form\u201d.", "description": "Greenpeace campaigners climbed a 40-metre billboard advertisement for Hyundai Motor's near its head office in South Korea to post a sign reading \"No more internal combustion engines\", the environmental group said on Monday.", "authors": ["Sangmi Cha", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430313491&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F04Y", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
