Who really believes that the best way to help a suicidal veteran is to take their guns away and then leave them alone? \u201cRed flag\u201d laws are a gun control measure masquerading as a mental health proposal, which is why Everytown is pushing it so hard.\n\nThe problem of veteran suicides by firearm drew Everytown\u2019s attention because of the statistics; the Department of Veterans Affairs reported last month that firearms were used in 69% of all veteran suicides in 2017, the latest year data is available. That\u2019s a nearly 33% increase from 2005. Everytown\u2019s first recommendation is for more states to enact extreme risk protection orders, also known as \u201cred-flag\u201d laws, which allow police or family members to temporarily remove someone\u2019s firearms if a state court agrees the person presents a danger to themselves or others. The idea is to place barriers between veterans in crisis and their firearms.\n\nSuicides are a huge problem in the veteran community, but red flag laws aren\u2019t the answer. Everytown for Gun Safety, for instance, says that since Connecticut instituted its red flag law in 1999, firearm-related suicides have declined by almost 14%. That sounds great until you realize that the state\u2019s overall suicide rate has increased by nearly 20% during the same time period, a fact that Everytown didn\u2019t bother to include in their report for some reason. They may be interested in reducing suicide by firearm, but most everyone else is interested in reducing suicide, no matter the means.\n\nAs it turns out, there are lots of folks in the military who aren\u2019t on board with the idea of using red flag laws to disarm veterans. Even Mike Washington, a veteran and member of Everytown for Gun Safety\u2019s veterans advisory council acknowledges that there\u2019s a huge amount of resistance among military members.\n\nWashington, who said he was \u201cvery fortunate\u201d to not have a gun in his house when he was suicidal, ran the suggestion for red flag laws past a group of Marine Corps veterans. They immediately bristled. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pushback,\u201d Washington said. \u201cThere\u2019s this fear that the cops are going to be the ones to do this. That fear of infringement on the Second Amendment, it\u2019s a big fear. That\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re right to be concerned, and they should be pushing back. As it is, there are many veterans who worry that a diagnosis of PTSD or depression will lead to the loss of their Second Amendment rights, and targeting veterans with red flag firearm laws will only make veterans even less likely to reach out and talk to others if they\u2019re struggling. It will stigmatize these veterans, without actually getting them the help that they need, especially if Michael Bloomberg\u2019s gun control group gets its way and enlists the VA to help flag veterans.\n\nEverytown wants the VA to take a more active role. Without interfering with patient confidentiality, the group wants the VA to work with law enforcement and veterans\u2019 families to petition the court for extreme risk protection orders. \u201cTaking action is part of their mandate,\u201d Burd-Sharp said. However, there\u2019s been pushback about the VA\u2019s involvement with law enforcement on the issue. Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., introduced a bill this summer that would stop the VA from reporting veterans to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System \u2013 the national database that gun merchants are required to check before selling a firearm. The VA considers veterans who cannot manage their VA benefits and need another person to help with their finances as \u201cmentally incompetent.\u201d The agency reports the names of those veterans to the FBI. The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act would force the VA to cease that practice. \u201cThis bill would ensure that the veterans who fought for our rights are guaranteed their own,\u201d Roe said in a statement.\n\nRoe\u2019s bill is a good start, but it\u2019s going to have an uphill fight in the Democrat-controlled House. In the meantime, Congress has stalled on any gun measures while impeachment takes center stage, but expect a push for \u201cred flag\u201d laws in state legislatures across the country when the 2020 sessions start to kick off in early January.", "description": "Everytown For Gun Safety is urging the use of \"red flag\" laws to prevent veteran suicides, but many military members are pushing back on the idea.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/57e7dc4b4d50a914ea89867ac42c3063143ad9e45a52754e742e_1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
