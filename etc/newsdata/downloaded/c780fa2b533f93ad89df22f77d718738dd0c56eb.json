Around 1.30 this morning, following late-night debate, peers were told a Conservative filibuster had been averted by a \u201cguillotine\u201d and the bill \u2013 passed on Wednesday by rebel Tories and the opposition in the Commons \u2013 could be returned to the lower house by 5pm tomorrow. We will be picking apart the implications in our politics live blog, which is up and running.\n\nLord Ashton of Hyde told peers: \u201cWe have also received a commitment from the chief whip in the House of Commons that Commons consideration of any Lords amendments will take place on Monday and it is the government\u2019s intention that the bill be ready for royal assent.\u201d Peers are set to begin debating the bill and their own amendments today after a fresh business motion is put forward by Lady Smith of Basildon, the Labour leader in the Lords. As the Lords session drew to an end, Richard Newby, the leader of the Lib Dems in the Lords, joked to the chamber that he was pleased not to have to stay all night and use his duvet.\n\nPlay Video 2:21 Brexit: House of Lords rejects filibuster of bill to prevent no deal \u2013 video\n\nThe developments come after Johnson suffered three heavy commons defeats in his first legislative outings as prime minister. They included failing to secure a general election, with Jeremy Corbyn insisting that the Benn bill must be passed and receive royal assent first.\n\nThe legal and political siege of the PM continues today as a court challenge is mounted to his plan to prorogue parliament. Lawyers for Gina Miller and her supporters will argue at the high court in London that Johnson asked the Queen to suspend parliament so he could prevent MPs scrutinising the government\u2019s Brexit plans and blocking a no-deal exit from the EU \u2013 an illegal breach of parliamentary sovereignty, it will be said. And, you wouldn\u2019t read about it \u2013 at least not normally \u2013 but now might be a good time to look at these books that seek to explain parliament.\n\nDeadly fireworks blast \u2013 An explosion at a fireworks factory has killed at least 20 people in India. Police said 15 other people were injured in Wednesday\u2019s blast in Batala, a town in Punjab state about 460km (285 miles) north of New Delhi. A local politician said the factory was illegal and pictures showed it reduced to a pile of bricks. Fireworks manufacturing is a big business in India, with crackers often used in festivals and weddings. Many illegal factories produce firecrackers that are cheaper to buy.\n\n\u2018Snack tax\u2019 \u2013 There\u2019s a bit of that old staple of public health news around today. A levy of 20% on biscuits, cakes and sweets could lead to the average Briton losing 1.3kg over the course of one year, obesity researchers have calculated. The effect would be greater among the lowest income families, where obesity levels are highest. In some countries sugar intake is mostly from drinks, but the UK is keener on sweets and cakes \u2013 a similar price increase on sugary drinks would result in a much lower average weight loss of 203g. Researchers writing in the British Medical Journal say the UK should consider a \u201csnack tax\u201d. A separate study in the BMJ suggests that vegetarians have a lower risk of heart attack, but may be in greater danger of a stroke. And the Royal College of GPs has criticised NHS England\u2019s proposal to let pharmacies diagnose high cholesterol and dispense statins without a doctor\u2019s involvement.\n\n\u2018Bring back union power\u2019 \u2013 Britain risks turning the clock back to the Victorian age without a shift in the balance of power from employers to unions, Frances O\u2019Grady, the head of the TUC, has said. O\u2019Grady warned of rising inequality and insecurity at work. The peak body of unions says in a report ahead of its annual conference next week that despite a recent pick-up in earnings, workers are still facing the longest pay squeeze for 200 years. The share of economic output going to wages has declined from an average of 57% in the three decades after the second world war to 49% in 2018. The TUC is calling for greater rights to negotiate collective bargaining agreements, including agreements covering whole sectors like hospitality; a \u00a310-an-hour minimum wage; a ban on zero-hours contracts; and access for unions to promote membership to employees in all workplaces.\n\nFake news storm \u2013 Donald Trump has appeared in front of a Hurricane Dorian map where Alabama appears to have been drawn into the storm front using a marker pen.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump holds a chart showing Hurricane Dorian\u2019s course. See the bit in black pen? Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP\n\nIt was apparently a belated effort to justify Trump\u2019s previous baseless claims that the latter state could be affected, when forecasters say it is out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nPlasticene era? \u2013 Plastic pollution is being deposited into the fossil record, research has found. Scientists suggest the plastic layers could be used to mark the start of the Anthropocene \u2013 the proposed geological epoch in which human activities have dominated the shaping of the planet. Analysis of sediment from off the coast of California dating back to 1834 showed layers mirroring the explosion in plastic production over the past 70 years \u2013 with the level doubling about every 15 years, researchers have said. \u201cPlastic was invented and pretty much immediately we can see it appear in the sedimentary record,\u201d said Jennifer Brandon, from the University of California San Diego.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Eye of a political storm\n\nAnushka Asthana follows the Guardian\u2019s political correspondents in Westminster as they attempt to make sense of another seismic week in British politics, with Boris Johnson losing his fragile majority and trying to get an election.

The question is whether it makes a difference at the ballot box, writes Gaby Hinsliff.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sonia Khan, the chancellor\u2019s aide who was escorted out of Downing Street by police after being sacked by Dominic Cummings.

Serena Williams\u2019s US Open rout of Wang Qiang was an ominous reminder of her powers but she has faltered at the last in recent majors and faces an in-form opponent in Elina Svitolina.\n\nRafael Nadal has beaten Diego Schwartzman in their US Open quarter-final while Roger Federer refused to blame his quarter-final defeat by Grigor Dimitrov on his sore back but it was clear he was physically gone in the deciding set. Andy Ruiz Jr has warned Anthony Joshua he will be faster, leaner and much better prepared for their controversial rematch in Saudi Arabia in December. And Eddie Jones will risk several big hitters when England meet Italy in their final World Cup warm-up game in Newcastle, having chosen to wheel out pivotal figures such as Billy Vunipola, Owen Farrell and Ben Youngs only 48 hours before the squad depart for Tokyo.\n\nBusiness\n\nAsian markets have roared back into life overnight as concerns about three neuralgic issues eased in the space of less than 24 hours. The Nikkei in Tokyo jumped 2.4%, the Hang Seng was up 0.4% and Shanghai 1.5% as the Hong Kong authorities made concessions to protesters, the prospect of avoiding a no-deal Brexit improved and the US and China announced trade talks would begin again in October. The FTSE100 is set to lift 0.35% at the opening while the pound slipped marginally to $1.224 and \u20ac1.11.\n\nThe papers\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s stalled bid to trigger a general election next month dominates coverage today. The Guardian says the \u201cCornered Johnson suffers triple Commons defeat\u201d, the FT has a similar report, though it has totted up the embarrassments for the PM differently: \u201cJohnson backed into corner as Commons delivers double blow\u201d, the i also has the \u201cPM cornered after day of defeats in the Commons\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guardian front page, Thursday 5 September 2019.\n\nThe Times says \u201cJohnson blocked as MPs refuse early election call\u201d and the Mirror labels Johnson \u201cBritain\u2019s worst PM (since the last one)\u201d, making it clear who they\u2019re referring to with an inset photo of Theresa May.\n\nThe Telegraph lambasts the Labour leader, saying \u201c\u2018Hypocrite\u2019 Corbyn rejects election to break deadlock\u201d, the Mail goes further, with a headline that says \u201cCorbyn chickens out of an election\u201d, and the Sun has superimposed Corbyn\u2019s head on to a chicken\u2019s body, with the headline: \u201cIs THIS the most dangerous chicken in Britain?\u201d The Express says: \u201cBoris urges \u2018people power\u2019 to force election\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
