Home\n\nA Massachusetts community has been left heartbroken and shocked after a family of five was tragically found dead at their home on Monday morning.\n\nFollowing the devastating discovery this morning, Plymouth District Attorney Timothy Cruz identified the victims to be Joseph Zaccardi, his wife Deirdre, and their three children \u2014 daughter Alexis, 11, and twins Nathaniel and Kathryn, 9.\n\nAll five family members were found with gunshot wounds but authorities say there is no threat to the community.\n\nIn a press release on Monday, Cruz said that authorities received a 911 call around 7:30 a.m. from a person who had shown up to the Zaccardi\u2019s Abington condo after they discovered one of the family members inside, who was later confirmed to be Deirdre, 40.\n\nDeirdre was said to have been unresponsive and \u201cin need of immediate medical attention\u201d by the person who was at the family\u2019s residence, Cruz said. According to WCVB 5, that person was reportedly a family member picking up one of the children for school.\n\nAfter officials arrived at the gruesome scene, they located four other bodies in the condo, all who were later confirmed to be members of the Zaccardi family.\n\nView photos Deirdre, Joseph and Alexis Zaccardi | facebook More\n\nIn his press release, Cruz said all the deaths appeared to be the result of gunshot wounds but that the community is likely not in danger.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be an isolated incident,\u201d he added during a press conference. \u201cThere is no current threat to public safety.\u201d\n\nAt this time, it is not clear where the rest of the family members were discovered and what may have caused this incident.\n\nAbington Police Chief David Majenski did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Four Dead After Apparent Murder-Suicide In Oklahoma\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the tragedy, a spokesperson for the Zaccardi family said they were struggling to come to terms with the five deaths.\n\n\u201cToday our family has suffered an unfathomable loss,\u201d they said in a statement, according to WCVB 5. \u201cAs we attempt to make sense of the enormity of this event, we respectfully ask that the media respect our family\u2019s wishes to be left alone as we grieve our tremendous losses in private.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s patriarch, Joseph, 43, was a children\u2019s book author who appeared to be struggling with his career as of late. At the time of his death, Joseph had listed his occupation on Facebook as \u201cunemployed and going crazy.\u201d\n\nIn April 2017, Joseph announced that he had published his third book, All Mixed Up, which was available to purchase on Amazon.\n\n\u201cPurchasing a copy will obviously help to promote the book, but simply spreading the word about its release would be extremely helpful too!\u201d he wrote. \u201cAgain, thank you for everybody\u2019s support and encouragement with each book I do! Without the support of family and friends, an individual\u2019s hopes or dreams can only go so far.\u201d\n\nView photos Deirdre and Joseph Zaccardi | facebook More", "description": "Struggling Children's Book Author, His Wife and 3 Children Found Dead", "authors": ["Joelle Goldstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YzLgLoIzySzdM8BClWEPDw--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MTgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/cfb62d7d56223dcb92c94154bc94c786", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
