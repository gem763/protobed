(Kevin Ambrose)\n\nIt was spooky! Just as the dark, stormy skies began to clear from the remnants of Tropical Storm Nestor, ghouls, ghosts and specters appeared in the streets of Colonial Williamsburg. And they were wearing colonial clothes!\n\nUnbeknown to me, I had arrived in Williamsburg just in time for the Haunting on DoG Street. I originally made the trip to shoot fall foliage, but the ghosts and specters stole the show for me.\n\nMy favorite spooky scene was a sword-wielding crocodile skeleton fighting another specter near the Colonial Capitol. At least I think it was a crocodile? You can judge for yourself; I have included a photo below.\n\nThe fall foliage in Williamsburg, which was just starting to turn gold and red, gave the colonial spooks the perfect Halloween backdrop for a scary but festive scene.\n\n[Peak fall foliage is inching closer to Washington, thanks to cooler, wetter weather]\n\n\n\nA fight in the streets of Williamsburg, just in time for Halloween. (Kevin Ambrose)\n\nDuring my stay, I also visited Yorktown and the American Revolution Museum, which featured outdoor living-history exhibits, including a recreation of a Continental Army encampment and musket and artillery firings.\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched the cannons fired at Colonial Williamsburg, the cannons at Yorktown are louder and give you more of a chest thump from the concussion. I was told by a Yorktown artilleryman they use a larger cannon and more gunpowder than Colonial Williamsburg.\n\nNo cannon balls are used for the demonstration, of course, but I witnessed a huge piece of wadding shot out of the cannon that landed in the woods. The artilleryman explained it\u2019s aluminum foil and it\u2019s later cleaned up.\n\nInside the museum, the story of the American Revolution, from King George III ruling the colonies to the election of President George Washington, is told through interactive displays, large storyboards and a nice collection of artifacts and paintings.\n\n\n\nPreparing to fire a cannon at Yorktown. (Kevin Ambrose)\n\nAnd to finish my photo shoot, I took a horse-drawn carriage through the streets of Colonial Williamsburg. The fall foliage was just starting to pop, and the scenes were beautiful.\n\nDan Hard, my carriage driver, explained the biggest challenge for driving a carriage is sudden movement to either side of the horse. Trash blowing across the street or a tourist moving quickly into the street can scare a horse, whose instinct is to bolt.\n\nHard said to train the horses to stay calm, they are put in stalls and tissue paper is repetitively tossed to their sides. Over time, the horses learn that tossed paper doesn\u2019t hurt them and they become much less stressed.\n\n\n\nFoliage turns yellow near Palace Green in Colonial Williamsburg. (Kevin Ambrose)\n\nI also visited the Williamsburg Winery and learned how this year\u2019s flash drought provided excellent conditions for the grape harvest, meaning 2019 should be a very good year for local wines. But that\u2019s a weather and wine story for a different day.\n\nIncluded in this post are a few of my favorite photos from my three-day photo shoot. Weather was a challenge much of the time, starting with flooding rains on Sunday and continuing with two days of cloudy skies. But, on Wednesday, the sky cleared and brilliant sunshine followed, which provided nice lighting for shooting photos.\n\nI think the fall foliage should peak in the Williamsburg area in the next two weeks, so there is still plenty of time for a visit.\n\n\n\nColonial ghouls on Duke of Gloucester Street.
