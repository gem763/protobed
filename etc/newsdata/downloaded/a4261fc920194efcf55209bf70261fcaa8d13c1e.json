USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The goggles to keep the champagne from stinging their eyes sit atop their lockers in the Nationals clubhouse, and masking tape is still on the walls from their last celebration.\n\nReally, everything was set, with President Donald Trump coming in Sunday for Game 5, and the nation\u2019s capital hosting their first World Series games in 86 years.\n\nIt was going to be historic, with fans frantically waving their red towels and everyone singing the 'Baby Shark' jingle.\n\nIt would be the ultimate celebration, one day telling their grandchildren just what it was like the day that the city won its first World Series title since 1924.\n\nOnly the Nats snubbed their own party.\n\nThree games.\n\nThree runs.\n\nThree losses.\n\nNationals reliever Daniel Hudson is not happy in the eighth inning. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Nats\u2019 World Series hopes, which burned so brightly just a few days ago, now are flickering like an energy crisis.\n\nThey are down three games to two to the Houston Astros, losing their three-time Cy Young winner Max Scherzer before the game, and then the game, 7-1. They became the first World Series team to score one or fewer runs in three consecutive home games.\n\n\u201cIt stinks,\" Nats closer Sean Doolittle said. \u201cWe feel bad about it. They came out, they showed up, the city waited 86 years for a World Series. Shoot, man, it\u2019s frustrating, it really is.\n\n\u201cI wonder if we were pressing a little bit just with the atmosphere that was here at Nats Park, how good the fans were. Sometimes, you want to really put that exclamation point on the situation, and bring the crowd to their feet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wondering if that played a role in it.\"\n\nWhatever the reason, the Nats simply weren\u2019t the same team that stunned the Astros in Houston the first two games of the Series.\n\nThey scored 17 runs in those games, hitting .307 with five home runs against Cy Young favorites Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole.\n\nCOLE: Ace delivers one last gem for Astros in Game 5\n\n\u00c1LVAREZ: Astros rookie breaks out of slump with huge hit\n\nThey returned home and hit .179 with one homer. They faced Cole again Sunday and produced just three hits and one run.\n\nThe Nationals overcome a 19-31 start, were four outs away from elimination in the wild card game, and six outs away in the NL Division Series.\n\nThis is a team that had won eight consecutive postseason games, and looked as if they seized control of the World Series with their first two victories in Houston.\n\nThey picked a lousy time to lose three games in a row for the time in seven weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably as frustrated as it was for them to come here, 0-and-2, and they did OK with that,\u2019\u2019 said first baseman Ryan Zimmerman. \u201cSo, maybe we\u2019ll do the same thing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all big boys that have played for a long time. We got to turn the page. There\u2019s nothing we can do. We\u2019ve got to go out and win two ballgames.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve won two games in a row plenty of times.\"\n\nAnd no matter the odds the Nats have overcome, no matter how glorious their season has been, they reminded everyone that it will be a gut-wrenching finish if their season doesn\u2019t end with a title.\n\n\u201cEverybody says you\u2019re playing with house money,\" Nats GM Mike Rizzo said. \u201cBull ... we want to win the World Series.\n\n\u201cWe put this team together not to win the wild card, or the division series, but to win the World Series.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re every bit as good as that team. I thought we were every bit as good as the Dodgers. These are super teams, and I think we can play with all of them.\"\n\nThey just have a funny way of showing it, at least in these last three games.\n\nSure, they got some tough breaks.\n\nThey had plenty of hard-hit balls that were outs.\n\nThere were some borderline ball-and-strikes that went the other way.\n\nAnd, of course, there was the gut-punch Sunday morning when Scherzer couldn\u2019t get out of bed, the pain in his neck and back too painful to move, causing him to miss the biggest start of his life.\n\nScherzer had a cortisone shot, and is hopeful he\u2019ll be ready if there\u2019s a Game 7, but realistically, he\u2019s done for the season.\n\nThe Nats can turn to Anibal Sanchez in Game 7. Or Patrick Corbin. Or a combo plate of the entire pitching staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sports \u2014 when someone gets hurt, you\u2019ve got to move on,\u2019\u2019 said Zimmerman. \u201cThis sport waits for nobody.\"\n\nBesides, it just goes along with the narrative that defines the Nats\u2019 topsy-turvy season, when every time the Nats looedk like they\u2019re done for the year, they managed to survive.\n\n\u201cHey, we had our backs against the wall all year,\u2019\u2019 Nats outfielder Adam Eaton said. \u201cThis is a battle-tested ship. We\u2019ve been through a lot of storms. It\u2019s the way the season has been all year.\n\n\u201cSo why change now?\"\n\nThis may be the first World Series in Nats\u2019 history, and they\u2019re the decisive underdog against the powerful Astros, but they\u2019ve come too far, they insist, to let it slip away now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not happy to just be here,\u2019\u2019 Eaton said. \u201cWe want to win this thing.\"\n\nWho knows, this Series has been bizarre enough already, maybe it will continue.\n\nIt\u2019s the first World Series since 1996 that the visiting team has won all five games, and just the third time in history.\n\nAnd no visiting team has ever won six in a row, let alone seven.\n\nSo, what\u2019s a little more history?\n\nRoad field advantage?\n\n\u201cSure, if that\u2019s what it takes,\" Nats shortstop Trea Tuner said, shrugging his shoulders, and raising his palms in the air. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in all of those things. I\u2019m not sure about that.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe only real thing the Nats believe in happens to be their Game 6 starter, Stephen Strasburg.\n\nHe has made four starts this postseason, and has won all of them, yielding a 1.93 ERA and .234 opposing batting average. He dominated the Astros in Game 2, giving up just two runs in six innings. He is 5-2 with a 1.34 ERA, with 64 strikeouts in eight postseason games.\n\nSo why shouldn\u2019t their confidence remain high to get them to Game 7?\n\n\u201cThese guys, they\u2019re not going to quit,\" Nats manager Dave Martinez said, \u201cI can tell you that right now. I truly believe these guys will get after it. I told them, 'We\u2019re going to play Game 7. I believe that. \u2026\n\n\u201cWe fought all year long to get here. We played playoff games all year long to get here. We had a lot of fight in us left.\n\n\u201cI know we do.\"\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "The nation\u2019s capital was all ready for a historic party, only the Nationals never showed up during their three-game World Series homestand.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
