In classic Chappelle form (feel free to use your imagination), the comedic giant\u2019s command over awe-inspiring ad-libs, clever crowd riffs, powerfully premeditated pauses, and cataclysmic counter-punches invites audiences to appreciate \u2014 once again \u2014 the value of comedy and free speech as an American bedrock.\n\nSuch a skillfully stricken balance between lamenting the looming extinction of American comedy and provoking the ire of Hollywood not only serves as a refreshing synthesis of comedy and controversy, but prompts another important message for audiences: Defending freedom of speech in America is now more vital than ever before.\n\nAs the president of an organization that works to defend free speech on college campuses, I have seen much of this firsthand. It\u2019s no secret that an epidemic of censorship has swept the American higher education system over the last several years, reducing the college experience to little more than four straight years of students being inundated with the same opinions from the same people every single day.\n\nSimilarly, silencing luminaries like Mr. Chappelle strips us of the self-reflection we are able to get from watching them. To a reasonable person, his routine \u2014 however vulgar, boorish or disruptive it may be \u2014 forces us to look in the mirror and question our beliefs. As George Orwell, author of iconic works like \u201c1984\u201d and \u201cAnimal Farm,\u201d once reminded us, \u201cIf liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.\u201d\n\nYou might love \u201cSticks and Stones\u201d or you might hate it. You might leave it feeling emboldened or you might simply get offended. You might not find it funny at all or, like Charlie Sheen, you might have to go to the hospital from laughing too hard.\n\nRegardless, Mr. Chappelle\u2019s rhetoric underscores just how far our respect for freedom of expression has fallen when entertainers have to bombard us with slurs, insults and cold-hard truths simply to remind us (however ironically) of the beauty of free speech. As distrust for political correctness continues to escalate every day, more and more Americans may find relief in the raw, untempered rhetoric of figures like George Carlin, Bill Burr and Mr. Chappelle.\n\nThis cancel culture of silencing celebrities just because we disagree with them must end. Do we have to support Dave Chappelle\u2019s words? No. But should we firmly defend his right to say them? Absolutely.\n\nOpening ourselves to opposing viewpoints is the only way we can grow as a society.\n\n\u2022 Cliff Maloney is the president of Young Americans for Liberty.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
