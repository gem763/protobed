On Oct. 16, we vacated the Lafarge Cement Factory, Raqqa, and Tabqah.\u201d\n\nFive hours later, he added: \u201cOn Oct. 16, after all #Coalition personnel and essential tactical equipment departed, two Coalition F-15Es successfully conducted a pre-planned precision airstrike at the Lafarge Cement Factory to destroy an ammunition cache and reduce the facility\u2019s military usefulness.\u201d\n\nRepublican congressman Adam Kizinger, who represents Illinois, tweeted: \u201cWe bombed our own base on purpose, because of the impulsive decision by @realDonaldTrump didn\u2019t leave time to evacuate the right way.

Mr Trump wrote: \u201cLet\u2019s work out a good deal! You don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2013 and I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistory will look upon you favourably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d he added.\n\nMike Pence and Mike Pompeo, the US vice president and secretary of state, were due to meet Mr Erdogan in Ankara on Thursday in a bid to persuade him to back down.", "description": "The US military bombed its own base as part of its hasty withdrawal from Syria\u00a0as militias backed by Turkey closed in, an Operation Inherent Resolve official has confirmed.
