Irrespective of whether such documents exist, a fact that the government does not concede here, the defendant fails to establish that such information is relevant\u2014let alone favorable and material\u2014in this criminal case,\u201d says the prosecution brief, signed by former Mueller prosecutor Brandon Van Grack.\n\nThe prosecution submission says many of the topics the defense is demanding information on don\u2019t ultimately bear on Flynn\u2019s admission that he lied to a pair of FBI agents in a January 2017 interview, particularly when he denied speaking with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition.\n\nThe defense seeks more details on discussions by top FBI officials about whether to notify the White House counsel or other officials about the planned interview, but prosecutors say that isn\u2019t germane to whether Flynn lied.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Nor do any communications that the FBI or DOJ had with members of the White House after the interview, since by then the crime had already occurred,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\n\nThe prosecution submission gives little ground, but it does offer at least one disclosure that could buttress arguments from Flynn\u2019s new attorneys that he didn\u2019t have an opportunity to fully explore some aspects of the investigation before deciding whether to plead guilty.\n\nThe government filing acknowledges that just one day before Flynn\u2019s guilty plea, his former lawyers were told about an internal investigation into text messages sent by one of the FBI agents who interviewed him, Peter Strzok, including messages \u201cthat showed a preference for one of the candidates for President\u201d \u2014 an allusion to Strzok\u2019s expressions of support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nProsecutors also acknowledged that Strzok didn\u2019t think Flynn was lying at the time of the interview, saying the national security adviser seemed to have \u201ca sure demeanor\u201d and exhibited no signs of deception. Notwithstanding that assessment, the prosecution contended that \u201cboth interviewing agents have been clear, since the beginning and in their documentation, that the defendant made false statements to them on January 24, 2017, about multiple topics.\u201d\n\nStill, the timing of the disclosures to Flynn\u2019s prior defense counsel \u2014 coming on the same day Flynn signed the paperwork for his guilty plea and just a day before a judge accepted it \u2014 could fuel claims that he was badgered into admitting guilt when he should have fought any charges.\n\nHowever, prosecutors note that at the time of the guilty plea, Flynn acknowledged he was giving up his rights to challenge the government\u2019s evidence against him. In addition, they note that at the first sentencing hearing Sullivan held last year, he asked Flynn if he understood by continuing with his guilty plea he was \u201cforever\u201d forfeiting the right to challenge the circumstances under which he was interviewed.\n\nThe retired general said he was aware of that and also said he had no concern that his lawyers at the time lacked any information they needed.\n\nAt the time of his guilty plea and the hearing last year where the judge ultimately postponed imposing a sentence, Flynn was represented by Robert Kelner, an attorney with the prominent Washington law firm Covington & Burling.\n\nIn June, Flynn retained a new legal team helmed by Dallas attorney Sidney Powell, who had been a vocal critic of the Mueller probe and its prosecutors.\n\nWithin days of the shift, Flynn\u2019s defense team and prosecutors were at odds, with a row breaking out over testimony Flynn was expected to give at a trial of his former business partner, Bjian Rafiekian, on charges relating to work the two men did for Turkish interests during the Trump campaign.\n\nFlynn was abruptly dropped as a witness in the case, even though Sullivan delayed Flynn\u2019s final sentencing specifically to allow him to complete that testimony.\n\nOne notable gambit by the prosecution in the new filing Tuesday was to call Sullivan\u2019s attention to the fact that while Powell has been praiseworthy and solicitous of the judge at court hearings, she expressed a different opinion about him in dealings directly with the Justice Department.\n\nProsecutors publicly filed a copy Tuesday of a letter Powell sent in June to Attorney General Bill Barr and Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, seeking to have the Flynn prosecutors reassigned and demanding a top-to-bottom review of the case.\n\nPowell\u2019s letter is sharply critical of Sullivan, accusing him of parroting talking points from cable news when he lit into Flynn at a sentencing hearing last December where he speculated about whether the retired Army general and Defense Intelligence Agency chief could\u2019ve been charged with treason.\n\n\u201cArguably, you sold your country out,\u201d the judge declared during the session. He later walked his comments back.\n\n\u201cJudge Sullivan was completely wrong on the facts of the case, and his rant seems to have come straight from MSNBC comments of the previous night,\u201d Powell wrote in her letter to Barr and Rosen.\n\nVan Grack told Sullivan at the December 2018 hearing that there was no consideration of charging Flynn with treason. The new prosecution filing says the government does not plan to argue at sentencing that the former national security adviser was working for Russia at any time.\n\n\u201cThe defendant is not charged with being an agent of Russia and the government has never alleged in this case that he was an agent of Russia,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cHis criminal conduct pertains to false statements about his communications with Russian officials, not his affiliation with that country.\u201d\n\nThe prosecution also referred to unspecified evidence shared with Flynn\u2019s defense \u201cthat would undermine the contention that he was an agent of Russia.\u201d\n\nSullivan has set a hearing for Nov. 5 on Flynn\u2019s demands for additional disclosures from the government. His continued sentencing hearing is tentatively set for Dec. 18.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/82/1d/01e13e7a4326bcba12be55060e97/20191001-michael-flynn-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
