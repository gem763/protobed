With only a few weeks left to live, the young woman is determined to enjoy what little time she\u2019s got left but, tonight, the severity of her illness hits her hard.\n\nSince receiving the devastating news that her cancer had returned, Sinead has been determined to enjoy the little time she\u2019s got left, but she was left further heartbroken last week when she learned that she only has a few weeks left to live \u2014 something which she later relayed to her friends and family during Ken\u2019s (William Roache) 80th birthday party.\n\nIn tonight\u2019s episode, Sinead decides to have a picnic with Daniel (Rob Mallard), Beth (Lisa George), Kirk (Andrew Whyment) and Craig (Colson Smith), but the severity of her illness well and truly hits her, as she\u2019s forced to use a wheelchair in order to get to the location of said picnic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfterwards, she attempts to join in on a game of charades, but becomes pretty clear just how poorly she is, and thus the game is called short so that Sinead can be taken home.\n\nLater, Sinead settles down on the sofa in front of the TV, ready to enjoy some time with Daniel, but she\u2019s hit with the realisation that she won\u2019t have many more moments like this one.\n\nCoronation Street continues on Wednesday 16th October at 7:30pm and 8:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Sinead comes to a realisation.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16_10_coro_daniel_sinead_1st_ep_02-2581_1571214890.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
