Mir, was sceptical of the government\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cWe have been hearing for days that they would restore mobile phones. So unless they actually do this on Monday, this is just another one of their announcements,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nHe also questioned the move to lift restrictions for tourists, when authorities have been saying throughout the clampdown that \u201clife is normal\u201d in Kashmir.\n\n\u201cThe government claims not a single bullet was fired. Then what was the panic situation that tourists were forced to leave in the first place?\u201d Mir said.\n\nIltija Mufti, a daughter of Kashmir\u2019s former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, one of the politicians in detention, said international pressure has forced the government\u2019s hand but the response was \u201cvery little, very late.\u201d\n\nIndia maintains that most people in its part of the disputed region support the move to take away the special status.\n\nIt had faced international calls however to ease the clampdown, including from UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet.\n\nThe phone clampdown caused widespread hardship, according to activists and community leaders. It meant ambulances and other emergency services could not be called to take patients to hospitals.\n\nIltija Mufti said that without internet people could not pay their mobile phone bills, \u201cso what\u2019s the point of opening mobile lines? Will they get a service.\u201d\n\nKashmir has been split between India and Pakistan since their independence in 1947. The two countries have fought two wars over the territory and cross-border clashes regularly erupt.", "description": "Srinagar (India) (AFP) \u2013 The Indian government said Saturday it would unblock most mobile telephone lines in Kashmir in a major easing of a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/31c1db_new-delhi-ended-kashmir-autonomy-on-imposed-mobile-phone-internet-blackout-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
