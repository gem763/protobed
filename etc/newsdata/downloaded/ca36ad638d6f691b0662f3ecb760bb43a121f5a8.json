He was scheduled to testify this week but the administration blocked him.\n\nThat prompted a subpoena by committees leading the probe in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives for Sondland to be deposed in closed session.\n\n'Notwithstanding the State Department's current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees' subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday,' Sondland's lawyers Robert Luskin and Kwame Manley said Friday morning.\n\nThe statement was released Friday, shortly before on the same morning that the former U.S. ambassador in Kiev, Marie Yovanovitch, testify about what she knows of the Trump administration's pressure effort on Ukraine.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, pictured in May aboard Air Force One, said through an attorney that he will testify to Congrss next week, defying an order from the State Department to steer clear of Democrat-led House committees pursuing a broad impeachment inquiry\n\nPresident Donald Trump recalled Marie Yovanovitch (center), the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine; she is talking to lawmakers behind closed doors on Friday\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, arrived Friday for an expected hearing with Yovanovitch\n\nSondland's lawyer had earlier said he wanted to testify, and that he had flown in from Brussels to appear on Capitol Hill \u2013 only to find himself blocked by Trump's State Department.\n\n'Ambassador Sondland has at all times acted with integrity and in the interests of the United States. He has no agenda apart from answering the Committees' questions fully and truthfully,' his lawyers said.\n\nSondland's deposition would give lawmakers the chance to probe his interactions with resigned U.S. Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker about an administration push to have Ukraine investigate Rudy Giuliani's unproven theory of Ukrainian election interference in 2016, as well as to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe White House's promise to stonewall a congressional impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump will get an early test on Friday when Yovanovitch is scheduled to testify to House investigators.\n\nThe career diplomat was abruptly recalled from Ukraine in May, and is now scheduled to give a deposition to congressional investigators probing Trump in the most recent scandal to cast a pall over his presidency.\n\nCongressional lawmakers were waiting to see if Yovanovich shows up after the White House said earlier this week it would refuse to cooperate with an impeachment inquiry that Trump has termed 'a kangaroo court.'\n\nThe inquiry was launched after a whistleblower complaint about a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender for the right to face Trump in the November 2020 election.\n\nDonald Trump recalled Yovanovitch to Washington, and Democrats want to know if he made the move because she was suspicious of his desire to see Joe Biden investigated for corruption\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable foreign ally to dig up dirt on a domestic political opponent for his own political benefit. Trump has denied he did anything wrong on the call.\n\nOn Thursday, two foreign-born Florida businessmen who had helped Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani investigate Biden were arrested in what prosecutors said was a scheme to illegally funnel money to a pro-Trump election committee and other U.S. political candidates.\n\nThe pair, Ukraine-born Lev Parnas and Belarus-born Igor Fruman, were arrested at an airport outside Washington carrying one-way tickets to Vienna. Prosecutors said they conspired to contribute foreign money, including at least $1 million from an unidentified Russian businessman, to candidates for federal and state offices to buy influence.\n\nThe two had donated $325,000 to a pro-Trump political action committee called America First Action in May 2018, and the money was falsely reported as coming from a purported natural gas company set up to conceal its true source, according to the indictment.\n\nThe investigation of Trump could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment \u2013 or formal charges \u2013 against the president in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the U.S. Senate, where the Republicans who control the chamber have shown little appetite for ousting the president.\n\nThe testimony from Yovanovitch is the first of several depositions of key figures planned by the House committees spearheading the probe, and whether she makes her appearance will offer an early gauge of White House cooperation.\n\nYovanovitch, described by colleagues as a consummate professional, became the target in March of allegations \u2013 vehemently denied by the State Department \u2013 that she gave a Ukrainian prosecutor a list of people not to prosecute.\n\nTrump allies called for her removal, accusing her of criticizing the president to foreign officials, something current and former colleagues found inconceivable. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, alleged she blocked efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAccording to a White House summary, Trump described her as 'bad news' to Zelenskiy in the July call in which he sought Zelinskiy's help to investigate Biden and his son. 'She's going to go through some things,' Trump added.\n\nOne of the foreign-born businessman arrested on Thursday, Parnas, sought the help of a U.S. congressman \u2013 identified by a person familiar with the matter as Republican Pete Sessions \u2013 to get Trump to remove Yovanovitch, according to the indictment.\n\nGiuliani told Reuters last week he had provided information to both Trump and the State Department about Yovanovitch, who he suggested was biased against Trump.\n\nSessions lost his House seat from Texas last year to a Democrat. In a statement quoted by Politico, he said his motivation in urging the removal of Yovanovitch was his belief that 'political appointees should not be disparaging the president, especially while serving overseas.'", "description": "Hotelier Trump donor-turned diplomat Sondland will speak to Congress next week his own attorney said, but cannot hand over any documents because those are the State Department property.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com", "David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/18/19601262-0-image-a-2_1570816014393.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
