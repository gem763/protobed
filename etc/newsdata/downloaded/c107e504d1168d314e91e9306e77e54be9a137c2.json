On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and buy the products, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nOf all the wardrobe items to become a seasonal sex symbol, the cardigan was the least likely contender. Whether woollen, cotton or cashmere, cardigans have almost always been derided among fashion insiders for being frumpy.\n\nSure, they worked for grunge types like Kurt Cobain \u2013 whose famous cigarette-singed cardi is set to sell on auction for \u00a3200,000 \u2013 but generally, cardigans have primarily been the reserve of pearl-clutching grandmothers and Women's Institute members baking batches of jam. At least they were until a photograph of Katie Holmes in a cardigan went viral.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMaybe it was the cardi\u2019s irresistibly luxurious \u00a31,700 cashmere, its neutral oatmeal shade, or its perfectly loose fit. Or perhaps it was the way Holmes wore it \u2013 with nothing but a matching bra underneath, and falling off the shoulder while she casually hailed a taxi, to reveal said expert matching. Whatever the reason, Holmes\u2019 humble cardigan sparked a sartorial revolution.\n\nAccording to global fashion search platform Lyst, which tracks data on 70 million shoppers around the world, searches for Khaite, the US brand behind Holmes\u2019 viral cardi, skyrocketed by 217 per cent after the \u201csexigan\u201d photograph was circulated on Instagram. Searches for cardigans are also up by 54 per cent month on month.\n\nWhat was interesting about Holmes' partially undone cardi ensemble, was how it so strongly juxtaposed with the prim and proper aesthetic we've come to associate with cardigans. Emily Gordon-Smith, director of consumer product at trends intelligence company Stylus, describes her look as the \u201cultimate nod to relaxed luxury\u201d.\n\nCharlotte Casey, senior knitwear editor at trend forecaster WGSN, concurs, adding that the cardigan is \"now more relevant than ever\".\n\n\"It went out of fashion because there was such a strong focus on the statement oversized crew neck, so it has been interesting to see some more streamlined, pretty and fitted styles coming back.\"\n\nCasey notes that such figure-hugging styles can help stop the cardigan from looking old-fashioned, but says that those looking for something laid back \u00e0 la Holmes, can quite literally take comfort in relaxed slouchy fits or oversized styles, which are just as on trend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised those photos of her went viral,\u201d she continues. \"But we're seeing all kinds of cardigan action going on at the moment, with different looks to suit all tastes.\"\n\nIndeed, the autumn/winter runways were packed with cardis of all sorts. They were striped and collegiate at Gucci, oversized and bejewelled at Christopher Kane, and feather-trimmed at Prada. Meanwhile, formal Jackie O styles made appearances at Pringle of Scotland, Oscar de la Renta and Bottega Veneta.\n\n\u201cThe cardigan can fit into so many trends and this autumn we\u2019ve seen huge engagement from a customer perspective,\u201d says Vikki Kavanagh, buying and merchandising director at The Outnet, where shoppers can snap up myriad discount designer cardis from brands such as Brunello Cucinelli and Ganni.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to splash out to tap into the trend. Gordon-Smith advises aspiring \u201csexigan\u201d wearers to take their cues from the 1990s, meaning it can be as simple as heading straight to the local charity shop - also a much more true-to-the-trend and sustainable way to adopt the look.\n\n\u201cA big look right now is the huge oversized cardigan worn with modest dresses and big boots,\u201d she says, adding that a lot of younger women are also pairing skinny fit cardigans with slip dresses.\n\nOr you can make like Holmes and try wearing a loose-fitting V-neck cardi with just a bralette underneath and skinny jeans, though you may want to keep it buttoned up if you\u2019re planning on donning this look in the office.\n\nFor those who really want to get experimental, you could even wear your cardigan backwards, as one fashion writer suggested recently in an article for The Cut \u2013 it doesn't look as odd as you'd think.\n\nSo yes, the cardigan is pretty versatile. But that\u2019s not the only reason why it appeals, says fashion stylist Anna Berkeley, who explains that it\u2019s one of the few wardrobe items that has the ability to flatter any figure.\n\n\u201cGetting it right is all about the lengths and proportions,\u201d she says. \u201cArket\u2019s cropped V-neck cardis are great for long waists and straighter figures. Theory and Khaite have fabulous fitted ones for curvy shapes \u2013 if they feel too long only do up one button under the bust line. If you\u2019re larger busted go for a shawl collar or edge to edge like Acne\u2019s raya style or Arket\u2019s mohair coatigan.\u201d\n\nFor ways to revamp your cardigan collection this season, see our outfit suggestions above.", "description": "Our fashion roundups are unbiased.
