And how common is it to have identical quads?\n\nThe NHS recommends a hospital rather than a home birth for anyone having more multiples.\n\nIn the case of quadruplets, doctors and midwives need to be on standby in case complications arise.\n\nMost common complications for multiple baby pregnancies Preterm Labour/delivery\n\nLow birth weight\n\nIntrauterine Growth Restriction (when an unborn baby is smaller than it should be because it\u2019s not growing at a normal rate inside the womb\n\nPreeclampsia\n\nGestational Diabetes\n\nPlacental Abruption\n\nFoetal loss\n\nCaesarean\n\nIf you\u2019re pregnant with multiple babies, the risks of certain things increase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowing two or more babies places greater demands on your body than a normal pregnancy.\n\nYou\u2019re more likely to have pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (gestational hypertension) than if you were expecting a single baby.\n\nPre-eclampsia is a complication related to high blood pressure that can happen in later pregnancy.\n\nIt\u2019s more common in multiple pregnancies because having more than one baby places extra strain on the placenta or placentas.\n\nPre-eclampsia is at least three times more common if you\u2019re expecting twins, and nine times more common if you\u2019re expecting triplets, than if you were expecting one baby.\n\nYour midwife might ask to take pee samples to check for evidence of high blood pressure.\n\nHigh blood pressure and protein in your urine can be early signs of pre-eclampsia.\n\nIntrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) is another condition that could affect quads.\n\nMultiple pregnancies grow at approximately the same rate as single pregnancies up to a certain point. In twin pregnancies, growth begins to slow down at 30 to 32 weeks.\n\nFor triplets, it\u2019s around 27 to 28 weeks. And quadruplet pregnancies begin slowing at 25 to 26 weeks.\n\nIUGR seems to happen because the placenta can\u2019t handle more growth and because the babies are competing for nutrients.\n\nYour doctor will monitor the growth of your babies by ultrasound and by measuring your abdomen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile twins may be delivered vaginally, the typical recommendation for more babies is via caesarian.\n\nBut delivering twins naturally depends on the position of the babies.\n\nQuads are pretty rare but the rise of fertility treatments are becoming more common.\n\nQuads can be identical, fraternal (when two separate eggs fertilized by two separate sperm), or a combination.\n\nMany sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals.\n\nIf they\u2019re fraternal (multizygotic) then it means four different sperms fertilised four different eggs.\n\nQuads are identical where there\u2019s a fertilised egg that splits into two or more embryos \u2013 it\u2019s possible for a split to occur more than once (monozygotic).\n\nIn the latter case quads are almost always the same gender. In some cases you can get a monozygotic triplet plus one (which may be three girls and one boy or vice versa).\n\nBut as mentioned above, quadruplets are pretty rare.\n\nMORE: When should you first feel your baby move during pregnancy?\n\nMORE: The best last-minute Halloween costumes for pregnant women\n\nMORE: Four-time cancer survivor shares how being diagnosed while she was pregnant changed her life\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "In the case of quadruplets, doctors and midwives need to be on standby in case complications arise.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_93929790_1572452181.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
