It muddies our legends with facts. Indeed, many local laws in the nineteenth-century prohibited carrying concealed weapons. A Dodge City billboard warned: \u201cThe Carrying of Firearms Strictly Prohibited.\u201d Also, that \u201cgun that won the west,\u201d the Peacemaker \u2013 was about a tenth as popular as the Harrington & Richardson. And the legendary Gun Fight at the OK Corral was triggered partially by the Tombstone, Arizona, law compelling individuals to check-in their guns when they arrived in town.\n\nHistory is also delightfully messy. Past nuance undermines partisan certainties. As UCLA Law Professor Adam Winkler writes in Gunfight, \u201cYou are certain to see more gunfights in a two-hour movie about the Wild West than you would have seen in a year of the dusty streets of Deadwood, South Dakota\u201d \u2013 or most Wild West hot spots. And the South, Winkler adds, \u201cwas the region where some of the earliest, most burdensome, gun control laws in American history were first enacted.\u201d At the same time, Southerners and Westerners were often gunslingers. And, as the Harvard Professor Steven Pinker writes in The Better Angels of Our Nature, the South and West were and remain America\u2019s most honor-obsessed, and thereby most violent, regions.", "description": "The Wild West wasn't so wild that it\u2014and the Stormy South\u2014couldn\u2019t include gun control.", "authors": ["Gil Troy"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1519591677/180225-troy-gun-control-lede_yaqjgb"}
