Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who bowed out of a brief 2020 campaign earlier this year, as \"President Swalwell\" \u2014 and acknowledged, in at least one case, that things might have gone differently in 2016.\n\nRep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., asked Lewandowski why he or others, including a deputy, Sam Clovis, hadn't talked with authorities about the contacts they knew were being made with campaign aides by Russians in 2016.\n\n\"In hindsight, it's something Mr. Clovis probably should have done,\" Lewandowski said.\n\nHe also used his time in the spotlight on Tuesday, which included a few break-ins on cable news, to tease a prospective congressional campaign in New Hampshire. During a break in the hearing, Lewandowski's account on Twitter posted a message soliciting help for his \"potential\" Senate run.\n\nRep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., cited the allusions as a reason not to take Lewandowski's testimony seriously.\n\n\"That says an awful lot about the witness' motivation to appear here today and I've heard enough,\" she said.\n\nWhat it's all about\n\nFor Democrats, the report and its lingering importance have to do with whether Congress impeaches Trump \u2014 ostensibly over the allegations that he obstructed justice in trying to frustrate the Mueller investigation.\n\nNadler sought to make clear before the fact that Congress is pursuing what he says is impeachment in a meaningful way, including in a recent interview with NPR member station WNYC.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee's minority Republicans, meanwhile, scoff at Democrats' free repetition of \"impeachment,\" which ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., and others call a scam.\n\nNadler is pretending there's an impeachment process underway, Collins says, when in fact the full House hasn't agreed to undertake one \u2014 and the Democrats' own leader, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, opposes it.\n\nCollins argues that Democrats are putting on a show to placate their most liberal supporters and create the illusion that impeachment is real. It's a \"faux-impeachment charade,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\n\"They don't have the votes,\" Collins said. \"The majority made a promise and they couldn't keep it.\"\n\nFlorida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz called the hearing a \"joke\" and complained about how poorly executed a joke it has proved.\n\n\"The path the majority has taken us on has rambled from disorganized to just downright dizzying,\" he said.\n\nThe Republicans despaired about ever moving on from the Mueller era in the House when the majority remains controlled by what Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas., described as \"the party of impeachment.\"\n\n\"They're going to find something \u2014 anything \u2014 to keep this impeachment hoax alive,\" he said.\n\nFor Lewandowski and other supporters of Trump, the Mueller legacy is about a cabal of insiders who conspired to frame Trump for conspiring with Russia's interference and the Democrats who colluded to perpetuate those charges.\n\nMueller's investigation established a number of links between Trump's camp and the Russians in 2016 but not a criminal conspiracy to throw the election.\n\nMueller's office also documented what some outside it have called obstruction by Trump \u2014 but the Justice Department did not seek an indictment in part because of the privilege that Trump enjoys as president protecting him from prosecution.\n\nAlleged obstruction\n\nIn the case of Lewandowski, the report describes him playing a central role in a bid by Trump to constrain the scope of Mueller's inquiry.\n\nTrump dictated a speech that he wanted Lewandowski to give to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, one in which Sessions would have said he wanted Mueller to confine his investigation to preventing interference in future elections \u2014 not looking into what took place in 2016.\n\nUltimately Lewandowski tasked someone else, then-deputy White House chief of staff Rick Dearborn, with delivering that message to Sessions. Dearborn balked and never conveyed it to the Justice Department.\n\nNadler and Democrats wanted Dearborn and another former White House official, Rob Porter, to appear with Lewandowski on Tuesday, but the Trump administration barred them from taking part.\n\nThe White House said their testimony was shielded by executive privilege \u2014 the doctrine that permits an administration to shield some of its workings from the public.\n\nLewandowski also said that was the basis for his reticence, even though he never worked for the Trump administration. Lewandowski said he recognized that it wasn't his privilege to invoke but he argued that he had a duty to protect the president's ability to meet and take counsel in confidence.\n\nNadler called that yet another example of what he said was Trump's attempt to obstruct discovery of facts about his administration.\n\n\"This is a shocking and dangerous assertion of executive privilege and absolute immunity,\" Nadler said. \"If he were to prevail in this cover-up while the Judiciary Committee is considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment, he would upend the separation of powers as envisioned by our founders.\"", "description": "The former campaign manager appeared before a House panel to defend President Trump over charges of \"collusion.\" Democrats focused on Trump's desire to constrain the Mueller inquiry.", "authors": ["Philip Ewing"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/17/gettyimages-1168851217_wide-145c9bafd7cba6b6936bbf5a91b3902bb7566cac.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
