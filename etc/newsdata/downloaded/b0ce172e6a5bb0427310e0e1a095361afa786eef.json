It\u2019s there \u2014 where a physical border with checks and infrastructure has not existed for 2 decades \u2014 that complex issues of identity, sectarian violence and trade have coalesced into Brexit\u2019s most intractable puzzle.\n\nBackground: Between 1968 and 1998, more than 3,000 people were killed and nearly 50,000 injured in sporadic bouts of politically motivated violence known as \"The Troubles.\"\n\nThe low-intensity armed conflict saw nationalist paramilitaries \u2014 most famously the IRA \u2014 carry out guerrilla campaigns against state security forces in the name of ending British rule and reuniting Ireland.\n\nsaw nationalist paramilitaries \u2014 most famously the IRA \u2014 carry out guerrilla campaigns against state security forces in the name of ending British rule and reuniting Ireland. Loyalists, who sought to remain part of the U.K., retaliated with attacks and bombing campaigns of their own, including against the minority Catholic community.\n\nwho sought to remain part of the U.K., retaliated with attacks and bombing campaigns of their own, including against the minority Catholic community. The conflict was formally ended in 1998 by the Good Friday Agreement, which established Northern Ireland\u2019s current system of government and created some shared institutions with Ireland. Perhaps most importantly, it demilitarized and essentially abolished all visible signs of the Irish border.\n\nBetween the lines: Some people in Northern Ireland feel Irish. Others feel British. After the Good Friday Agreement, the lack of a hard border \u2014 since both Ireland and the U.K. are in the EU \u2014 made it possible for people to identify with either.\n\nGeorge Hamilton, the chief constable of Northern Ireland\u2019s police service, tells the BBC that any new border infrastructure installed after Brexit would be attacked by Irish nationalists: \"If you put up significant physical infrastructure at a border, which is the subject of contention politically, you are re-emphasizing the context and the causes of the conflict.\"\n\nFlash forward: Theresa May was unable to pass her Brexit deal through Parliament because of opposition to the so-called \"backstop,\" an insurance policy that would keep the U.K. aligned with the EU\u2019s customs rules in case the two sides couldn\u2019t figure out another way to avoid a hard Irish border by 2022.\n\nNew Prime Minister Boris Johnson has demanded that the backstop be removed, arguing that it would trap the U.K. inside the EU\u2019s orbit indefinitely. The EU has refused, stressing that it\u2019s simply a backup policy to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is preserved.\n\nhas demanded that the backstop be removed, arguing that it would trap the U.K. inside the EU\u2019s orbit indefinitely. The EU has refused, stressing that it\u2019s simply a backup policy to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is preserved. Johnson has claimed that \"under no circumstances\" would the U.K. put up border checks in Northern Ireland, but he has not proposed any viable alternatives to enforcing customs rules after Brexit. Leaked documents from his own government suggest that an open border would be \"unsustainable\" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nWhat to watch: Parliament returns from recess next week, where its first order of business will be staging a cross-party rebellion to stop a no-deal Brexit. But lawmakers' power was severely hampered by Boris Johnson's dramatic decision on Wednesday to suspend Parliament from Sept. 11 to Oct. 14, giving them limited time to get their act together.\n\nGo deeper: More on what Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament means for Brexit", "description": "It cost Theresa May her job, catapulted Boris Johnson to Downing Street, and could result in a cliff-edge Brexit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Jj1cXrDuqrxmLyQf1RxP8kJRNOM=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/08/28/1567019087298.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
