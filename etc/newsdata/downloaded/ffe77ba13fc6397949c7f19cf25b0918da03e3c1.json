Per arrest records, Madden was accused of biting the victim and \u201cremoving a large chunk of [her] face.\u201d\n\nFace-ripping is the sort of behavior that you imagine would not elude the grasp of the prosecutor\u2019s office. Not, it seems, in Kentucky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadden was arrested \u2014 his sixth arrest, with a rap sheet including burglary, assault, and threatening to kill a child \u2014 but soon after his arrest, a clearly deranged Madden was found incompetent to stand trial and was sent to Kentucky Correctional Psychiatric Center (KCPC), the state\u2019s competency restoration facility, for the entirety of the 30 days allowed by statute. Still unable to aid in his own defense at the end of 30 days, Madden was placed by Judge Annie O\u2019Connell on an additional 60-day hold, the longest extension permitted by Kentucky law.\n\nThe 60-day extension came and went, and Madden was still unable to stand trial. Judge O\u2019Connell said, since he was \u201cunlikely to regain competency in the foreseeable future,\u201d the sexual assault charges against him would be dropped. The burden then fell on the prosecution to civilly commit Madden\u2014an obvious danger to the community \u2014 to one of Kentucky\u2019s psychiatric hospitals for treatment. They succeeded.\n\nLater, however, the hospital released Madden, insisting it had no legal standing to hold him. Why? He didn\u2019t meet the state\u2019s strict standards for involuntary commitment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May, mere months after his February release, Madden was arrested again, this time for breaking and entering a place of business. The same process ensued \u2014 a competency hearing, a fruitless attempt at restoring competency, dismissal, civil commitment, and ultimately, release.\n\nA psychiatrist from the KCPC, a facility where Madden had previously assaulted staff\u2014testified before a judge that Madden had verbally expressed his desire to \u201ckill and rape the first female he came in contact with\u201d upon his release, and also wrote letters which stated that \u201che wanted to grab a three-to six-year old and have sex with them.\u201d\n\nEven though he was unfit to stand trial and the breaking-and-entering charges were dropped, Madden\u2019s deranged behavior was sufficient grounds for the prosecution to commit him to one of Kentucky\u2019s four state hospitals. Staff at Central State Hospital in Louisville, where Madden was sent following the May arrest, nevertheless discharged him soon after his admission, again citing Madden\u2019s failure to qualify for involuntary commitment according to the state\u2019s four-pronged statutory threshold.\n\nAs Madden promised he would, he proceeded to \u201crape the first female he came in contact with\u201d less than 24 hours after his discharge. He was arrested in August after allegedly beating an eight-year-old girl over the head with a shovel, fracturing her skull, and violently raping her while unconscious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadden is back in police custody. His defense attorney is asserting that he, again, is incompetent to stand trial. If a judge finds that he is, precisely the same procedures that set him loose last time could do so again.\n\nMadden, unfortunately, does seem incompetent to stand trial. Local Fox affiliate WDRB reports that Madden \u201chas, at times, been unable to answer even the most basic questions about his life: where he was born and raised, what school he went to and why he received a disability check.\u201d In his February trial, the same Judge O\u2019Connell said that \u201cMr. Madden lacks the intellectual capacity to understand his basic constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nThere are two major questions here. First, why does Kentucky insist on dropping the charges for an incompetent, mentally ill defendant accused of a violent crime after 90 days? And, more directly, why can\u2019t the state hospitals keep a man off of the streets when he is clearly mentally ill and a danger to other people?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncompetence to stand trial is different from an insanity plea. Madden\u2019s previous sexual-assault charge was never brought to trial not because he was adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity, but instead because, as Judge O\u2019Connell asserted, he was not capable of understanding the case against him. Competence refers to a defendant\u2019s ability to aid in his own defense, a judgment of his fitness ex tempore which does not bear on his sanity at the moment of the crime. An insanity plea, by contrast, means the defendant is not culpable for his actions because he was insane at the time he committed the act. It makes no remark on the defendant\u2019s current mental state.\n\nIncompetent defendants and forensically insane patients often (but not always) end up at the same forensic hospitals. But the latter category are assigned sentences they must serve in those hospitals \u2014 either indefinite detention, pending their rehabilitation, or for some constrained period of time \u2014 while the fate of the former group varies wildly from state to state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s not as though Kentucky\u2019s loophole is a national problem. The WDRB report highlights the starkly different approaches taken by neighboring states with incompetent defendants. Indiana, for instance, remands a defendant to a state hospital if and until he is competent to stand trial; instead of Kentucky\u2019s 30-day maximum and a possible 60-day judicial extension, Indiana allows for incompetent defendants to be held in a state hospital for period commensurate with the criminal penalty for their alleged crime.\n\nKentucky\u2019s policy of dropping the charges against defendants who are unfit to stand trial following a 30-day attempt to restore their competency forces the state\u2019s civil commitment statutes\u2014the ones used by the prosecution to remand Madden to a state hospital\u2014to be strong enough to securely hospitalize an imminent threat like Madden. Unfortunately, they aren\u2019t.\n\nKentucky\u2019s four-step test for determining a person\u2019s eligibility for involuntary commitment is as follows: 1)A person must be mentally ill; 2) he must be a danger to himself or others, 3) he must be reasonably expected to benefit from treatment offered at the hospital; and 4) hospitalization must be the least restrictive treatment method available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf an individual fails to meet even one of the four criteria \u2014 even if he is an immediate threat to themselves or others, as Madden obviously was \u2014 he cannot be involuntarily held in a psychiatric facility.\n\nThis ironically allows Madden\u2019s attorney to argue that since his mental illnesses were so acute, and his mental incapacity so profound, treatment at a state hospital would not \u201cbenefit\u201d Madden as the statute demands. Courts reluctantly agreed, and Madden was discharged from Central State Hospital hours after his arrival.\n\nMadden is too mentally ill to treat. This is absurd, obviously, and Hardin Commonwealth Attorney Shane Young noted as much: \u201cThe person we can\u2019t help \u2014 the person who\u2019s so mentally ill that they\u2019re not going to be helped, they\u2019re not going to be better \u2014 those are the ones we\u2019re required to release back into the public.\u201d\n\nLawmakers are reportedly mulling changes to the commitment standards, as well they should. But those changes can\u2019t come soon enough \u2014 Madden\u2019s trial could well proceed with no statutory changes, and he\u2019ll once again be released to the broader community.\n\nJefferson Commonwealth Attorney Tom Wine told WDRB that they prosecutors will \u201chave no alternative\u201d but to release a mentally ill man accused of assaulting and raping an 8-year-old girl if he is found incompetent. It\u2019s incumbent upon lawmakers to give him one.", "description": "Cane Madden's face-ripping is the sort of behavior that you imagine would not elude the grasp of the prosecutor\u2019s office.
