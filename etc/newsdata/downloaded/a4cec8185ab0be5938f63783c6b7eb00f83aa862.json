Media reports said they favoured a Dec. 9 election.\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party has said it will back an election once the risk of a potentially chaotic no-deal Brexit has been ruled out but the party is divided as it trails Johnson's Conservatives in opinion polls.\n\nBritain is due to leave the world's biggest trading bloc on Oct. 31 but parliament has passed a bill forcing it to secure a delay to prevent the country from leaving without a deal to smooth the process.
