Plus, women are twice as likely to have gone without sex for a whole year compared with men (they say we\u2019re picky, we say have you seen the slim pickings on Tinder lately?).\n\nThis joyous news comes courtesy of a new survey of sexual attitudes in the journal The Lancet, which suggests a mounting (sorry) dissatisfaction with our sex lives compared with the male of the species (although 15% of them also reported a drop in libido).\n\nAccording to sexual health lecturer Dr Cath Mercer, \u201cStress is to blame. As is technology. People are taking their tablets and cellphones into the bedroom at night and some people are using porn as a sex substitute.\u201d\n\nBut, as Angelina Jolie\u2019s good rep proves, everything is reversible. Read on for three solutions to guide you back to project O.\n\nRead more: 5 low libido causes that have nothing to do with hormones\n\nThe problem: Stress\n\nThe experts say: Your boss is the reason you associate the word \u201cclimax\u201d with the end of a really long AGM rather than a saucy quickie up against the fridge. The humble foot massage will sort you out (bear with us here). Studies conducted by the National Institute of Health in the US have proven that reflexology instantly decreases blood pressure and lowers anxiety.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, says acupuncturist Sandra Bird, a foot massage provides access to one of the most heightened sexual release points on the body \u2013 the \u201cyongquan\u201d or \u201cgushing spring\u201d point located on the sole, about a third from the base of the second toe and two thirds from the heel edge. Basically, that midpoint where his massaging thumbs fit perfectly.\n\nIn other podiatry-related sex news, pushing on the bit between your big toe and second toe is apparently another major stress-release point. Time for a toe wax!\n\nRead more: The top 10 reasons for low libido\n\nThe problem: Devices\n\nThe experts say: Emailing, scrolling through News24 comments and playing Candy Crush are detracting from the actual button pressing you want in the bedroom. A recent study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that when women ignore common distractions (phones, TVs, laptops), they can start to become aroused in as little as 30 seconds. Yet an eye-watering 81% of adults always take their cellphone or tablet to the bedroom at night.\n\nHere\u2019s how to kick the habit: Set your alarm before you even enter the bedroom and don\u2019t touch your phone once you\u2019re in bed, suggests Dr Elna Rudolph, WH sex expert and head of MySexualHealth.co.za. Or, on the flip side, you could make your smartphone part of the action (no, not like that, there aren\u2019t enough screen wipes in the world for that game).\n\nRead more: 4 best foods to give your libido a boost\n\nThe problem: Porn\n\nThe experts say: Women make up one in three viewers. What\u2019s more, a recent survey found that both sexes aged 16 to 44 say watching it is often more exciting than the real thing. If you\u2019re busy getting more on-screen action than off, be careful. \u201cExposure to explicit content gives you an addictive chemical rush and neuronal firing in your brain \u2013 much like cocaine,\u201d says Dr Rudolph. \u201cCompared to porn, normal sex will most likely be far less intense.\u201d\n\nSolo viewing can put an intimacy wedge between you and your partner, so convert porn-viewing to a joint activity instead. \u201cUse it for inspiration for sex moves or to open up dialogue about what you like or don\u2019t like,\u201d says Dr Rudolph. \u201cBut, if you need it to get into the mood every time, there\u2019s something else going on.\u201d\n\nFor something genuinely educational, try DreamsOfSpanking.com, which weaves tips on technique into the entertainment.
