It also shelved plans for its first US dollar-denominated debt deal in 23 years.\n\nThe airline, which is trying to complete a three-year financial turnaround plan, has become the biggest corporate casualty of the Hong Kong protests after China demanded suspension of staff involved in, or supporting, the demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into a political crisis.\n\n\"We continue to see a significant shortfall in inbound bookings for the remainder of 2019 as compared to the same snapshot last year,\" Cathay Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said in a statement on Friday.\n\nCathay said last month it would cut capacity for the upcoming winter season.\n\nInbound traffic to Hong Kong was down 38 percent in September compared with the same month in 2018, following a similar drop in August, with demand from the mainland Chinese market hit especially hard, the airline said.\n\nHoteliers such as IHG and Accor, which operate the Ibis and Novotel chains, have also been hit by the sharp decline in tourists, as have many luxury goods retailers who have been forced to temporarily close their shops.\n\nIHG saw quarterly revenue per room fall 0.8 percent globally, but recorded a whopping 36 percent drop in Hong Kong sales. The group blamed lower business bookings in China and the protests in Hong Kong.,\n\nThe company, which has nearly 5,800 hotels under brand names such as Crowne Plaza and Regent Hotels & Resorts, said revenue per available room declined 6.1 percent in Greater China.\n\nIts competitors such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and Raffles owner AccorHotels have also warned of slowing growth in China as the China-US trade war and a slowing global economy dampen spending on business and leisure travel to China.\n\nStiffer drinks\n\nMeanwhile, Remy Cointreau also accused falling tourism in Hong Kong for hurting cognac sales in its latest quarter, adding to a decline in revenue across the group.\n\nGroup sales of its brands such as Remy Martin cognac and Mount Gay rum were down 4 percent in July to September period after a 3 percent sales fall in the previous quarter.\n\nCognac sales had \"suffered from the fall in tourism in Hong Kong and from slower than anticipated stock replenishment by retailers in the United States\", the company said on Friday.\n\nGlobally, spirit makers cheered as cognac, champagne and blended whiskies were excluded from a list of goods set to be slapped with 25 percent US tariffs on Friday, as part of a trade dispute over European Union aircraft subsidies.\n\nBut some wines and types of whisky will still be affected. France's Pernod Ricard said on Thursday it may raise prices on spirits like its Glenlivet Scotch whisky as a result.", "description": "IHG, Accor, Cathay Pacific, Remy Martin fear that the second half of 2019 could be even bleaker as tourists avoid city.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/12/c791d07ae6c14d578ff515c7dad36592_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
