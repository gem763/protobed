That would be down from the 164,000 rise seen in July.\n\nThe is forecast to remain steady 3.7%.\n\nThe weaker backdrop in U.S. manufacturing and retail, bankruptcies in the shale industry and falling demand for long-haul truck drivers are expected to keep a lid on job growth, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n\nWages are expected to rise 0.3% in August, the same as July, but to fall slightly to\n\n\u201cThe good news is that much of the acceleration in wages we are now seeing is occurring among the lowest paid workers, which shows up almost immediately as consumer spending,\u201d Swonk added.\n\n2. Oil Rig Count Rolls In\n\nTraders will look to the latest rig-count data due Friday for clues on crude production activity as U.S. production remained close to record levels at 12.4 million barrels a day last week.\n\nData last week showed the operating in the U.S. fell by 12 to 742.\n\nThe weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.\n\nOil prices, on track for a second-straight weekly win, have been buoyed by easing U.S.-China trade tensions and ongoing signs of tightening domestic supplies after data showed U.S. inventories declined by more than expected last week.\n\n3. Powell & Co. Take to the Stage\n\nFed Chairman will speak on Friday in Switzerland. Powell will be accompanied by other panel speakers including, Fed Governor and four regional presidents: Boston Fed's , New York Fed's , Minnesota Fed's and Chicago Fed's .\n\nWith expectations running high the Fed is set to in just under two weeks, Powell's speech will likely be parsed for clues on whether the central bank is leaning more dovish in the run-up to the Fed meeting on Sept. 17-18.\n\nAccording to Investing.com\u2019s , there's a 94.5% chance the Fed cuts rates by a quarter point later this month.", "description": "Day Ahead: Top-3 Things to Watch", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC140QN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
