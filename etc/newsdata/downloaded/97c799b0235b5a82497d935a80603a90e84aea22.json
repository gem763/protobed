But we can do something about that", "language": "en", "text": "I have a hazy memory of the last time a president faced removal from office. I was in third grade, and my teachers and parents made me feel as if Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment had nothing to do with me. I couldn\u2019t affect the outcome, and the outcome wouldn\u2019t affect me. At the time, I admit, I was largely preoccupied with obtaining a pair of glitter capris from Limited Too, and figuring out what the big deal was with this so-called \u201cblow job.\u201d But I\u2019m now a 28-year-old writer, and it occurs to me that impeachment is still being presented as a mysterious pageant that the average person can\u2019t even begin to understand.\n\nOn Thursday, the House will vote for the first time on the impeachment inquiry, going on record in regard to the rules for public hearings. The decision over what will be revealed to the American public fails to contend with the reality that very few people will feel empowered to form an opinion about that information, and even fewer will have the drive to do anything about it.\n\nBut if the American government is going to bother masquerading as a democracy, then the public must be empowered to participate in the political process with the help of our political and media gatekeepers. As it stands, our elected officials are conducting themselves as if their behavior does not require the consent of the governed, and the standard coverage of their conduct ratifies this as an acceptable reality. Not to go all Schoolhouse Rock on you here: But there will not be a government by and for the people, unless it is driven by our input.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNow, the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d has become the rhetorical equivalent of a used Band-Aid. Conservative men will likely want to jump in here to insist that, um, actually, America is a \u201crepublic.\u201d Except America is neither of those things. As it stands, a small group of people is making the majority of decisions about the wealth and power of this nation \u2014 and they\u2019re not even pretending that that we have any input. The oligarchy has never been so obvious as through the lens of impeachment.\n\nPart of the problem is that the conversation about impeachment has been framed as a face-off between two teams by many of the leading figures in mainstream media. Politico regularly issues headlines citing gains for Democrats or Republicans in the House\u2019s inquiry, while The New York Times asserts the unlikeliness of conservative Senators voting to impeach, as if it is a matter of fate: \u201c[Impeachment] would require 20 Republicans to side with Democrats in convicting Mr Trump,\u201d the paper of record wrote in a recent article, \u201cand few observers believe that will happen.\u201d\n\nThis past weekend, at a Nationals game in Washington DC, the audience booed President Trump when he appeared on screens at the game, with many in the crowd chanting, \u201cLock him up.\u201d In response to this, Morning Joe host Mika Brezinski said the crowd shouldn\u2019t have have booed, and expressed concerned over behavior from \u201cboth sides.\u201d \u201cIf u want to make your voice heard, vote,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\n\nIt should be obvious that it is possible, and in fact necessary, to raise our voices beyond the ballot box, especially given that the current president lost the popular vote. Political acts beyond voting are a historical piece of democratic culture, no matter who inhabits the Oval Office. Our elected officials should seek to be held accountable to those they represent, and it is the job of the journalist to empower people with the information they need to make our will known. Brzezinski\u2019s insistence that people stop booing is more than a tone-deaf tweet. Her words encapsulate a grander failing of impeachment coverage overall, and the way it denies us the ability to raise our voices as a public.\n\nThe most critical sickness in American politics is that we have been kept from the constant civic participation that democracy requires by political and media gatekeepers who perpetuate the idea that politics is a spectator sport. That\u2019s especially obvious with impeachment.\n\nThe binary framing of impeachment as some sort of death match between Democrats and Republicans creates a sense of inevitability that is baldly anti-democratic. In my personal opinion, the Republican Party is \u2014 in the words of Noam Chomsky \u2014 \u201cthe most dangerous organization in human history,\u201d and the Democratic party is mostly a bunch of bureaucrats tending to the status quo like it\u2019s their personal zen garden. But this is not about the appropriate attribution of blame or my own particular ideological leanings. I write this with a bias only toward true democracy. That requires each and every one of us to raise our voices all the time, and I truly do mean that, even if we disagree politically.\n\nOne of the most absurd elements of the current impeachment conversation \u2014 and there are many \u2014 is that we must simply accept the proceedings in Washington as \u201cjust the way things are.\u201d The presentation of two sides pushes us to the sidelines, where even the most avid participation is a matter of cheering the loudest for your team. Impeachment is about the integrity of our democracy, and right now the clear loser is the American people. Our congressional representatives are meant to represent us; that means the full scope of their constituents, not just the people who voted for them, and certainly not the agenda of their political party. If our elected officials refuse to enact public will in regard to impeachment, then, they too, need to be removed from office.\n\nWe\u2019ve gotten to the point where our elected officials proceed as if they cannot be held accountable in impeachment proceedings, or when it comes to passing policy proposals for the climate crisis, gun reform, and healthcare \u2014 issues which the majority of the country believes are in need of solutions. Moneyed interests, gerrymandering, the geographical bias of our electoral process, and voter suppression are among the structural realities that suppress our voices. In spite of these obstacles, our media and political gatekeepers should be working to empower us with the information we need to express ourselves as a citizenry, or rather, that is what they would be doing if they gave a shit about democracy.\n\nIf you\u2019re witnessing impeachment for the first time right now, I\u2019ll tell you now the same thing I would tell my third-grade self, even though she was not yet old enough to vote: No matter who you are, politics affects you, and that means you have the right and duty to express your opinion in the political conversation.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal 1/22 Donald Trump Accused of abusing his office by pressing the Ukrainian president in a July phone call to help dig up dirt on Joe Biden, who may be his Democratic rival in the 2020 election. He also believes that Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails - a key factor in the 2016 election - may be in Ukraine, although it is not clear why. Reuters 2/22 The Whistleblower Believed to be a CIA agent who spent time at the White House, his complaint was largely based on second and third-hand accounts from worried White House staff. Although this is not unusual for such complaints, Trump and his supporters have seized on it to imply that his information is not reliable. Expected to give evidence to Congress voluntarily and in secret. Getty 3/22 The Second Whistleblower The lawyer for the first intelligence whistleblower is also representing a second whistleblower regarding the President's actions. Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower. Getty 4/22 Rudy Giuliani Former mayor of New York, whose management of the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 won him worldwide praise. As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/22 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/22 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/22 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/22 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant. Reuters 9/22 Hunter Biden Joe Biden\u2019s son has been accused of corruption by the president because of his business dealings in Ukraine and China. However, Trump has yet to produce any evidence of corruption and Biden\u2019s lawyer insists he has done nothing wrong. AP 10/22 William Barr The attorney-general, who proved his loyalty to Trump with his handling of the Mueller report, was mentioned in the Ukraine call as someone president Volodymyr Zelensky should talk to about following up Trump\u2019s preoccupations with the Biden\u2019s and the Clinton emails. Nancy Pelosi has accused Barr of being part of a \u201ccover-up of a cover-up\u201d. AP 11/22 Mike Pompeo The secretary of state initially implied he knew little about the Ukraine phone call - but it later emerged that he was listening in at the time. He has since suggested that asking foreign leaders for favours is simply how international politics works. AFP via Getty 12/22 Nancy Pelosi The Democratic Speaker of the House had long resisted calls from within her own party to back a formal impeachment process against the president, apparently fearing a backlash from voters. On September 24, amid reports of the Ukraine call and the day before the White House released a partial transcript of it, she relented and announced an inquiry, saying: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Getty 13/22 Adam Schiff Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, one of the three committees leading the inquiry. He was criticized by Republicans for giving what he called a \u201cparody\u201d of the Ukraine phone call during a hearing, with Trump and others saying he had been pretending that his damning characterisation was a verbatim reading of the phone call. He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint. The Washington Post awarded Schiff a \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d rating, its worst rating for a dishonest statement. Reuters 14/22 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman Florida-based businessmen and Republican donors Lev Parnas (pictured with Rudy Giuliani) and Igor Fruman were arrested on suspicion of campaign finance violations at Dulles International Airport near Washington DC on 9 October. Separately the Associated Press has reported that they were both involved in efforts to replace the management of Ukraine's gas company, Naftogaz, with new bosses who would steer lucrative contracts towards companies controlled by Trump allies. There is no suggestion of any criminal activity in these efforts. Reuters 15/22 Kurt Volker The former US ambassador to NATO was appointed special envoy to Ukraine, and is thought to have played a role in linking Giuliani with Ukraine officials. He resigned just before giving evidence to Congress, which had subpoenaed him. After his testimony it emerged that he had apparently told Giuliani that he was being fed false information about the Bidens from Ukrainian officials. Getty Images 16/22 Marie Yovanovitch A career diplomat who was appointed US ambassador to Ukraine towards the end of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. She was abruptly recalled from her post in May 2019 amid claims that she was not co-operating with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s unorthodox activities in Ukraine. In the Ukraine phone call Trump refers to her as \u201cthe woman\u201d and \u201cbad news\u201d and hints darkly at some sort of retribution, saying: \u201cWell, she\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d Yovanovitch told House investigators in October that she felt as though she were targeted by a false accusations from Giuliani and his associates, who allegedly viewed her as a threat to their political and financial interests. She also said that State Department officials had told her she did nothing wrong, and that her abrupt removal was not related to her performance. Trump had simply lost faith in her abilities. AP 17/22 Gordon Sondland A Seattle hotelier who became US ambassador to the European Union after donating $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee, despite having no diplomatic experience. According to the whistleblower, Sondland met Ukrainian politicians to help them \u201cunderstand and respond to the differing messages they were receiving from official US channels on one hand and from Mr GIuliani on the other\u201d. Sondland told House investigators during October 2019 testimony that he had been disappointed with Trump's decision to involve his personal lawyer in dealings with Kiev \u2014 and stated that the president refused counsel from his top diplomats, and demanded Volodymyr Zelensky satisfy his concerns about corruption. Those diplomats had told Trump to meet with Zelensky without preconditions, according to Sondland. His testimony is at odds with the testimony of some other foreign policy officials, however, who indicated that Sondland was a willing participant. Reuters 18/22 George Kent A career diplomat, he was number two at the Ukraine embassy under Marie Yovanovitch. Kent testified before House investigators in October 2019 that he was cut out of Ukraine policymaking after a May meeting orchestrated by acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and was told to \"lay low\". The deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs said that he though it was \"wrong\" that he was sidelines by Trump's inner circle. Following the May meeting, Kent said he was edged out by Gordon Sondland, Kurt Volker, and Rick Perry, who \"declared themselves the three people now responsible for Ukraine policy\", according to a politician who attended the closed door testimony.

US State Department 20/22 Philip Reeker Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of State, testified that he did not find out about a push by the Trump administration to force Ukraine to publicly announce an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden until the whistleblower complaint was made public. While he was asked about any quid pro quo in that regard, Reeker indicated he was in the dark and so could not provide further details. But, he did fill in details during his October 2019 testimony on the circumstances surrounding the firing of Marie Yovanovitch. Democrats described his testimony has providing further backup to other testimony they had heard. AP 21/22 William Taylor William Taylor, the top US diplomat to Ukraine, testified during an October 2019 hearing in the house that American aid to Ukraine was explicitly tied to the country's willingness to investigate Donald Trump's political rival. Taylor's testimony was explosive, and made him a key witness to the Trump administration's efforts to use the force of the American government to push a politically motivated investigation against Joe Biden. He said the efforts came through an \"irregular, informal channel of US policy-making\" led by Rudy Giuliani, Kurt Volker, Rick Perry, and Gordon Sondland.
