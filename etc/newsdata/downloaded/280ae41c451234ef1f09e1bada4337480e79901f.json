It feels like we\u2019ve been on a flight a lot shorter than that.\u201d\n\nQantas partnered with two Australian universities to monitor how jetlag affected the health of passengers and crew members as they crossed multiple time zones.\n\nAfter boarding the flight, passengers set their watches to Sydney time and were kept awake until night fell in eastern Australia with lighting, exercise, caffeine and a spicy meal.\n\nSix hours later, they were served a high-carbohydrate meal, told to avoid screens, and the lights were dimmed to encourage them to sleep through the night.\n\nProfessor Marie Carroll, a researcher from Sydney University who conducted the experiment, told AFP that she expected the innovative approach would result in \u201cabsolutely minimal\u201d jetlag.\n\n\u201cI expect that they will have a normal day today and a normal night\u2019s sleep tonight,\u201d she said, adding that she felt \u201camazingly good\u201d considering the flight time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all an experiment to see if airlines can adjust their schedule of food, beverages, exercise and lighting to be in sync with the destination time.\u201d\n\nThe four pilots on board \u2014 who rotated between flying duties \u2014 also wore devices that tracked their brain waves and alertness.\n\nThe Australian and International Pilots Association, which represents Qantas pilots, has raised concerns about whether pilots will get enough quality rest during ultra long-range flights to maintain peak performance.\n\nIt has called for a \u201cscientific long-term study\u201d into the impacts on crews.\n\nThe airline says the test journeys are just one facet of the work it is doing to ensure the flights are operated safely.\n\nQantas last year introduced the first direct service from the western Australian city of Perth to London, with the 17-hour journey one of the longest passenger flights in the world.", "description": "Sydney (AFP) \u2013 The longest non-stop passenger flight touched down in Australia Sunday morning after more than 19 hours in the air, a milestone", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/ef1faf_qantas-is-weighing-rollout-regular-services-on-marathon-routes-us-britain-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
