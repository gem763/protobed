REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun\n\nThe Finn roared to victory in Sunday\u2019s Japanese Grand Prix to narrow the gap to Hamilton, who finished third and set the fastest lap, to 64 points.\n\nThe 30-year-old Bottas is now the only driver who can still overhaul Hamilton, with a maximum of 104 points remaining to be won from the final four races, but his hopes are more mathematical than realistic.\n\nHamilton need not win again to clinch the title and would still be leading even if he fails to score for two races and Bottas takes maximum points. The Briton could take the title as early as the next round in Mexico on Oct. 27.\n\nWith Mercedes having wrapped up a record-equalling sixth straight constructors\u2019 crown on Sunday, and sure of an unprecedented title double for the sixth year in a row, the Finn can pull out all the stops.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to give up as long as there is a theoretical chance,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat happened here is a good example because I was starting third with two Ferraris ahead, so it was going to be difficult to win, from this point of view.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s possible. But I\u2019m realistic as well and I would need to be very lucky \u2014 that\u2019s a fact \u2014 to win all the rest of the races.\u201d\n\nBottas has three wins to Hamilton\u2019s nine this season.\n\nThe Finn rebounded strongly from a winless year in 2017, leading the championship early on after two wins in the first four races.\n\nHis form has waned since, with Sunday\u2019s victory his first since the Azerbaijan Grand Prix at the end of April.\n\nIn his third season with Mercedes and already confirmed for next year, Bottas has tended to fade in the second half of the year.\n\nWhile blaming himself for falling behind Hamilton in the title battle this season, he used some earthy language to counter those detractors questioning his staying power over the course of a campaign.\n\n\u201cI nearly said some swear words again, I don\u2019t know if I did,\u201d said Bottas of his comments over the radio after taking the chequered flag, before then using an expletive on live television.\n\nHe made his point with similar directness after his win in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in March.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a good feeling and obviously there\u2019s quite a few people say that normally I don\u2019t perform in the second half of the season,\u201d he said of his latest win.", "description": "Valtteri Bottas will not make life easy for Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton even though the Briton is now within touching distance of a sixth Formula One world championship.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440357856&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0DQ", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
