Not at all. The 13-inch iPad Pro is thinner than the Surface Pro X, and it might have a smaller battery (although that's unclear, as Microsoft hasn't listed the Surface Pro X's battery size).\n\nRather, I'm saying that the Surface Pro X has an impressive battery life, especially for such a compact and portable device, and considering that it runs the full version of the Windows 10 operating system.\n\nSure, 13 hours may not actually seem that impressive, as other laptops can claim more battery life. But those laptops are almost always going to be chunkier and heavier. The Surface Pro X's benefit is that it can fit in a backpack or bag without taking up much space or adding more weight. The Surface Pro X is only slightly thicker the iPad Pro and weighs only 1.7 pounds without the detachable keyboard. With the keyboard attached, it might weigh closer to 2 pounds.\n\nRead more: I tried the Surface Pro X, Microsoft's slim new $1,000 laptop with long battery life, a brand-new processor, and huge potential\n\nAnother view of the Surface Pro X. Business Insider/Antonio Villas-Boas\n\nThe key here is Microsoft's so-called \"SQ1\" chip, a processor made by Qualcomm that's based on the \"ARM\" architecture.\n\nWith that in mind, some tech journalists at Microsoft's Surface event weren't as impressed, as ARM chips have shown that devices can get up to 20 hours of battery life. But that expectation comes from mobile versions of ARM chips that you might find in Android smartphones.\n\nThe ARM chip in the Surface Pro X is designed for computers, and it's made to deliver computer-like performance rather than smartphone-like performance, a representative told Business Insider at the Surface event. With that in mind, the Microsoft SQ1 ARM chip soaks up more power than a standard ARM chip. As a result, an ARM-based laptop designed for computer performance isn't going to get the same battery life as a smartphone.\n\nWhile the SQ1 chip in the Surface Pro X is designed for computer performance, it won't be powerful enough for heavy-duty tasks like gaming or video editing. But for everything else, like web browsers and productivity apps like Microsoft Office, it's likely all anyone would ever need.", "description": "The Surface Pro X gets 13 hours while the iPad Pro gets 10 hours \u2014 impressive for a full Windows 10 laptop that's about the size of the big iPad Pro.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d961cc6270f2d23aa18b624?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
