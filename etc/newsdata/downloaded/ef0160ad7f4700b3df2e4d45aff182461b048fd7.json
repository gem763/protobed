As it is paid monthly in arrears there is an average five-week wait for the first payment to be received.\n\nPhillip quit his job in a factory to look after his three children but fell behind with rent and trying to feed and clothe them.\n\nMinutes before he took his own life on March 18, he posted a picture of himself crying in his car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis mother, Sheena Derbyshire, 54, told the Mirror it was dangerous to make families wait so long for payments when they are already desperate.\n\nPhillip Herron, 34, died with only \u00a34.61 after the wait for Universal Credit payments plunged him further into debt (Picture: Mirrorpix)\n\nShe said: \u2018In his suicide note he said his family would be better off if he wasn\u2019t there anymore.\n\n\u2018He was a single dad. He was responsible. He always had money before and the kids had the best of everything.\u2019\n\nUniversal Credit was brought in by the coalition government in 2013 to replace a number of benefits with one single payment.\n\nMrs Derbyshire only discovered how dire Phillip\u2019s financial situation had become in the weeks after his death.\n\nLetters at his home detailed how much debt he was in, and he had also been served an eviction notice.\n\nPhillip posted this picture on social media just minutes before taking his own life (Picture: Mirrorpix)\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \u2018Our thoughts are with Mr Herron\u2019s family.\n\n\u2018Suicide is a very complex issue, so it would be wrong to link it solely to someone\u2019s benefit claim.\n\n\u2018We are committed to safeguarding vulnerable claimants and keep guidance under constant review to provide the highest standard of protection.\u2019\n\nNeed support?
