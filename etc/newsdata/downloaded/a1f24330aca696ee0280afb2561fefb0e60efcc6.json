Pictured right is PC Stuart Outten after he was attacked in Leyton, east London, in August\n\nShe told The Daily Express: 'I want respect to be bought back into policing but I am absolutely clear that anyone who has the audacity or the nerve to assault a police officer should get a sentence that is appropriate.\n\n'My message is very clear. The days of getting a slap on the wrist for assaulting a police officer have to be over and I want to see the right kind of sentencing for the thugs who do.'\n\nThere were 30,977 assaults on police officers last year, 10,399 of which caused injury, an increase of 32% from 2015/16.\n\nPC Chris Burnham, 47, was hit by a car in Coventry last month and suffered a fractured skull and shattered knee.\n\nOn August 8, PC Stuart Outten, 28, was slashed with a machete in Leyton, east London, before he was able to Taser the attacker. A few days later PC Gareth Phillip, 42, was run over by his own patrol car.\n\nPC Andrew Harper, 28, was killed while responding to a burglary in Berkshire on August 15, becoming the first British policeman to die on duty since Keith Palmer was stabbed outside Parliament in 2017.\n\nPC Outten, 28, was slashed with a machete in Leyton, east London, before he was able to Taser the attacker\n\nMs Patel, who has previously said she wants criminals to 'feel terror' when they commit crimes, also vowed in the newspaper interview to introduce more bobbies on the beat after Boris Johnson's recruitment drive.\n\nOn October 1, she used her speech at the Conservative Party Conference to unveil a \u00a310 million ring-fenced fund to equip up to 60 per cent of police officers with Tasers.\n\nShe also announced a \u00a320 million investment to aid in identifying and dismantling county lines drugs gangs which exploit children and other vulnerable people.\n\nOfficial figures released in July revealed crime reported to the police had risen to a 15-year high of 5.9million.\n\nViolent crimes in England and Wales rose by 20 per cent to 1.6million, the highest since the National Crime Recording Standard was introduced in April 2002.\n\nAt the same time, the number of police arrests and stop and searches have plummeted - just as gang violence has surged.\n\nIn the summer, Mr Johnson promised to put an extra 20,000 police officers on the streets to tackle the crisis.\n\nHe also signalled a crackdown on soft sentences, saying that offenders who had been given 14 years or more in jail for violent or sexual offences would be expected to serve more of their jail terms behind bars.\n\nNow Mr Buckland has promised to go further - rebalancing a situation where victims of crime feel let down by the system.\n\nA few days at PC Outten was attacked, PC Gareth Phillip, 42, (pictured) was run over by his own patrol car\n\nCurrently, under laws enacted by Labour in 2005, almost all offenders are released after having served only half of their sentence in prison.\n\nIt is not dependent on good behaviour or a risk assessment - meaning criminals are still freed from jail early even if they pose a risk to the public or show no remorse for their crimes.\n\nSome 3,000 criminals would be forced to serve longer sentences, the Ministry of Justice said.\n\nMinisters acknowledge some form of early release is needed to ensure there is not a 'cliff edge' for prisoners. Instead, they have to spend time on licence to ease their return to the community.\n\nMr Buckland also ruled out dispensing with the 'short, sharp shock' for law-breakers.\n\nEx-Justice Secretary David Gauke wanted to abolish sentences of less than six months. He said two-thirds of criminals imprisoned for less than six months reoffended within a year, putting the public at risk.", "description": "The British Home Secretary is now reviewing sentencing guidelines with Justice Secretary Robert Buckland to ensure the police feel 'supported by the criminal justice system'.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/06/19525688-0-image-a-2_1570686718746.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
