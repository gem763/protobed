The DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, said Johnson\u2019s Brexit package was bad for Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cI can give you absolute assurance we will not be voting for this deal when it comes before the Commons tomorrow,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nThe deal\u2019s fate could largely rest on a group of former Conservative Party rebels expelled from the party earlier this year and members from the main opposition Labour Party, which has 244 members. Around 20 of them, mainly representing pro-Brexit parts of the country, have previously indicated a desire to back a deal in order to honor the June 2016 Brexit referendum result.\n\nIf Johnson\u2019s charm offensive manages to corral enough votes to pass the deal, Britain would leave the EU in an orderly fashion on Oct. 31.\n\nIf lawmakers reject the deal \u2014 as they did three times with an earlier deal presented by Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May \u2014 a law passed earlier this year compels the prime minister to ask the EU for another extension.\n\nAsked Thursday what he would do if Britain seeks an extension, European Council President Donald Tusk said he would consult the other 27 EU nations in order to reach a decision \u2014 leaving open the prospect of another delay.", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 After winning the backing of European Union leaders for his new Brexit deal , Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in London Friday looking to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/18/1442a8_aptopix-belgium-eu-brexit-17041-british-prime-minister-boris-johnson-leaves-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
