And that seems to be just what Chris Martin is singing about, over some of the poppiest woo-woo\u2019s, sax solos, and horn sections the band could possibly find. Take this lyric from \u201cOrphans,\u201d which sounds decidedly not about orphans: \u201cI wanna know when I can go / back and get drunk with my friends.\u201d Me, too! Meanwhile, the other new single, \u201cArabesque,\u201d features French lyrics about how we\u2019re all the same, along with the first time the band\u2019s used the word \u201cfuck\u201d on a song. Coldplay members \u2014 they\u2019re just like us! Except, you know, they take 100 years to make an album.\n\nRelated", "description": "Coldplay has debuted two singles, \u201cOrphans\u201d and \u201cArabesque,\u201d off its upcoming double album \u201cEveryday Life.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/24/24-coldplay-new-music.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
