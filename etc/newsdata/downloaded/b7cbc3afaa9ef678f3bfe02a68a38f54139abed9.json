By the time she rediscovered the book, the family had moved to Plymouth.\n\n\u201cI found it and then didn\u2019t even want to tell my mom,\u201d recalled Ms. Kidik, 25 years old. She hid the book in her bedroom bookshelf for months before coming clean ahead of a family trip to Carver. Embarrassed, she returned it, and her mom paid the $3.25 fine.\n\nMs. Kidik felt so guilty she avoided borrowing another book for nearly 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s this weird shame that we have about library late fees,\u201d said Ms. Kidik, now a communications analyst at an asset management firm.\n\nLibraries have come to realize what a lot of guilty readers already know\u2014that late fees prompt some borrowers to keep books rather than face the humiliating tsk-tsk of librarians collecting late fees. That chapter is about over.\n\nThis week, Chicago became the largest American metropolis to end charges for overdue books, joining at least 150 library systems in the U.S. and Canada that have ended late-shaming fines, according to the Urban Libraries Council. So far this year, libraries in St. Paul, Minn., Dallas and Oakland, Calif., are among those that have joined the late-fee amnesty movement.\n\nLibraries are fighting for customers to survive in a digital world. One strategy is to remove the twin burdens of fines and guilt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d rather have you come to the library and engage in our services,\u201d said Curtis Rogers, a spokesman for the council. The American Library Association in January urged libraries to scrutinize overdue fines and \u201cactively move toward eliminating\u201d overdue fees.\n\nJamillah Williams-Bay assists a library patron at the Woodson Regional Library in Chicago, which has ended fines for overdue materials at public libraries.

Libraries often cap fines at $5 to $10, or charge the cost of replacing the item, according to a 2017 study by the Library Journal.\n\nFor many borrowers, the money is less onerous than the feelings of disgrace. St. Paul Public Library Director Catherine Penkert said friends used to hang their head in shame and confess \u201cI didn\u2019t even want to tell you, I have fines.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you have overdue library books at home? And will you be returning them now?Join the conversation below.\n\nSharon Bostick, who recently retired as the dean of libraries at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, knows the feeling. She created the Library Anxiety Scale, a part of her doctoral dissertation.\n\n\u201cAll the rules that we have, and the fines and the fees, they\u2019re making libraries really hard to deal with,\u201d she said. \u201cPutting everybody in this spot where they\u2019re going to be fined to death is not helpful.\u201d\n\nSince St. Paul killed overdue fines, some branches have seen a double-digit percentage increase in circulation. Citywide, circulation is up nearly 2%, a surprising plot twist after years of steady declines.\n\nThe fear of returning overdue books is part of American culture. In a 1988 episode of \u201cMarried with Children,\u201d character Al Bundy faced a $2,163 fine for a copy of the \u201cLittle Engine That Could\u201d 31 years overdue. A 1991 episode of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d has Jerry being dogged by a library cop over a book due in 1971.\n\nSeinfeld meets the Library Cop.\n\nLibrary fines used to be more than annoying or embarrassing. In years past, they could wreck credit scores until credit agencies largely eliminated unpaid parking tickets and overdue books from their reporting.\n\n\u201cThe topic has come up so frequently that we decided to include it among our credit myths,\u201d said Nancy E. Bistritz-Balkan, spokeswoman for Equifax.\n\nThe company said library fees can still end up on a credit report if the fines are referred to a collection agency, which some states allow. In Wisconsin, then- Gov. Scott Walker signed such a law in 2015 authorizing libraries to turn laggard patrons over to collection agencies or police.\n\nMr. Walker declined to comment.\n\nCasey Kidik was bothered for years by guilt over an overdue book in grade school.

It operates \u201cGentle Nudge,\u201d a program the company clams to have recovered more than a billion dollars in books and other materials from tardy borrowers.\n\nFormer Californian Jonathan Melikidse still has a library book that has long weighed on his conscience. The copy of \u201cJames and the Giant Peach\u201d was due back on Nov. 13, 1981.\n\nHe checked out the Roald Dahl classic from the Glendale Public Library for a second-grade book report. It took him past the due date to finish. So he kept it. \u201cI was a guilt-ridden 8-year-old,\u201d Mr. Melikidse said. \u201cI was certainly not in a hurry to confess my deviance.\u201d\n\nThe book has traveled with him through his many moves around Southern California, from Glendale to Los Angeles to Oxnard to Santa Barbara. These days, he is in Maui, and so is the book.\n\n\u201cPerhaps I felt it was mine now,\u201d Mr. Melikidse said. \u201cOr perhaps it\u2019s just the lazy child still afraid of the repercussions he\u2019ll face by admitting his crime.\u201d\n\nHe has considered returning the book on his next trip to Southern California. First, he said, he wants to read it to his kids.\n\nBryan Griest, a reference librarian at the Glendale Public Library, said he wasn\u2019t sure what the library would do with the long-lost volume since it has been replaced.\n\n\u201cWhat would happen if he returns it today? Nothing,\u201d Mr. Griest said.\n\nThe Glendale library in July eliminated fees on books for children and teens.\n\nWrite to Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com and Ben Kesling at benjamin.kesling@wsj.com", "description": "Libraries battling to retain borrowers in the digital age are ending late fees, a change intended to ease the shame and dread of returning overdue books.", "authors": ["Erin Ailworth", "Ben Kesling", "Ben.Kesling Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-113100/social"}
