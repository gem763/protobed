We heard a loud bang. I thought it was from the building work we are having done.\n\n\u201cMy husband went to look and saw the body lying in the middle of the lawn.\n\n\u201cThe man had fallen right next to one of the lodgers who was in the garden at the time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just thankful it didn\u2019t hit him. He was in shock.\u201d\n\n(Image: Linkedin)\n\nA next-door neighbour added:\"He had all of his clothes on and everything. I had a closer look and saw there was blood all over the walls of the garden.\n\nThe stowaway was in the landing gear compartment, and it is believed he was already dead when his body plunged from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner as its wheels were lowered.\n\nIn July detectives in Nairobi questioned whether the stowaway could have clambered into the landing gear hold on an earlier flight from South Africa to Kenya, before climbing onto the London bound plane.\n\nThe four-hour, 3,000-mile flight from the South African city to the Kenyan capital took off in the early hours of Sunday, arriving at 7am local time.\n\n(Image: Newsflare)\n\nTwo hours later, the same aircraft departed Kenya bound for London, a distance of more than 4,000 miles.\n\nThe death is not being treated as suspicious by officers from the Metropolitan Police Central South Command Unit who are investigating.\n\nThe man's body is being held at a mortuary.\n\nOnce the investigation is complete a file will be produced for the coroner and an inquest can take place\n\nDetective Sergeant Paul Graves, of the South Central Command Unit, said: \u201cWe have pursued a number of lines of inquiry in what has been a very sad incident to investigate.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\n\u201cThis man has a family somewhere who need to know what has happened to their loved one.\n\n\u201cOur investigation has included liaison with the authorities in Kenya, from where the flight took off, but so far our efforts to identify this man have proved fruitless.\n\n\u201cI hope by releasing this e-fit someone known to the deceased will recognise him and make contact.\u201d\n\nAnyone who can assist the investigation is asked to call police on 101 ref CAD 5395/30 June.", "description": "The Metropolitan Police have released the e-fit of a man who fell from a plane as it neared Heathrow Airport", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Met Police", "Swns", "Linkedin", "Newsflare", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20642834.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Heathrow-Airport_4927JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
