Jackson acknowledged their point and urged both sides to find an alternative.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s five-page filing, the Justice Department said those talks didn\u2019t go well. Stone\u2019s attorneys rejected a plan that would have involved jurors being read a jointly written statement describing the scene. Instead, they said, the film should come up only if witnesses talked about it during the trial.\n\n\u201cIn the government\u2019s view, this confirms the importance of playing the short scene for the jury,\u201d the Justice Department prosecutors told Jackson. \u201cThat scene played a direct part in the very obstructive acts charged in this case.\u201d\n\nA breakdown in talks over the \u201cGodfather\u201d scene puts the issue back before Jackson, who is scheduled to hold another pretrial conference one day before jury selection begins on Nov. 4.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/45/be/903a878b4c11b9ffde5e1c666f0c/190716-roger-stone-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
