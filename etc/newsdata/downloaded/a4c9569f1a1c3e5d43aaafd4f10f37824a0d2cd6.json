The wireless unit had a total retail postpaid churn of 1.09% with retail postpaid phone churn of 0.82%.\n\nWhat's notable about Verizon's results is how its wireless business for companies is insulating it somewhat from intense competition for consumers.

The consumer wireless business had 193,000 retail postpaid net additions with 239,000 phone net additions.\n\nVerizon CEO Hans Vestberg said the rollout of 5G and wireless traction left the company \"energized\" about the fourth quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, Verizon said it has saved $4.6 billion in cash savings since announcing a play to save $10 billion in 2018.\n\nVerizon said that it added 36,000 FiOS Internet connections, but continued to lose video customers. The Verizon Media unit, which includes Yahoo and AOL, saw revenue fall 2% in the third quarter to $1.8 billion due to declines in desktop advertising.
