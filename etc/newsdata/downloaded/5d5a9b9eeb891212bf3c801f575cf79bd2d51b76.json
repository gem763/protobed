From mobile phones to tablets, children seem to never get enough of these gadgets.\n\nReading books seems to be a thing of the past, but there is one person who wants to ensure that children remain engrossed into books.\n\nThe 32-year-old author has come up with a new book of short stories 'Your Story Your World', which will reintroduce kids to the traditional and original idea of reading.\n\nIn a conversation with Indiatimes, the new author and mother of two opens up on how she came with the idea of penning a book.\n\nDon't Miss 192 SHARES 547 SHARES 151 SHARES\n\nRecalling how the idea of writing a book unfolded, Neha said it was a normal study session with her daughter that prompted her to do something to make learning easier for her.\n\n\"I was sitting with my daughter making her learn flags of the world when I first came across memory techniques, a skill that makes learning easier. They'd been around for long, but no one ever spoke about them. I had lots of information to give her and was looking for plenty of ways to make her remember the colors and characteristics of each flag,\" she said.\n\nTaking it a step further, she stumbled upon memory chains for her daughter to make her learning faster and easier.\n\n\"I quickly realised that what I'd found was actually an approach to learning that could work for anything at all. Almost overnight, I ended up making similar chains. It was like getting superpowers! I could make my daughter learn anything with this simple technique. My best memory chains were super simple,\" she added.\n\nWhy on children?\n\nChildren's inquisitive nature always inspired Neha, and that factor played an important role for her to take up this subject.\n\n\"I love to be in the company of children and I am a mother of two myself. Children's inquisitive nature is what inspires me everyday. I'd like to, in my own capacity, nurture their natural creativity and do what I can to not crush it\", she said.\n\nShe also highlighted the key difference between her book of children in comparison to others.\n\n\"Your Story Your World is a concept-book unlike any other story book. It is based on a very unique concept called the mnemonic link system that helps children retain concepts by making memory chains. All my stories aim to reinstate the power of storytelling among children and invoke their natural curiosity. By doing so I try to develop their imagination and embrace their wishful thinking. This book encourages children to think and make their own stories. It is one of a kind and something that has never been done in the past\", she said.\n\n\"A mnemonic device, or memory device, is any learning technique that aids information retention or retrieval in the human memory.\"\n\nNow that her first book is out, Neha is working on her second book, which is an extension of the first one and she aims to cover all the seven continents of the world in the next one year. The book is expected to be out sometime early next year.", "description": "Children these days are hooked more to electronic devices.
