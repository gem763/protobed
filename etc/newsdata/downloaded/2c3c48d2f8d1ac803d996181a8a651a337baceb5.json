and leaders who engaged in, or were oblivious of, human rights abuses in camps, including rape, torture, unlawful and arbitrary detentions that sometimes led to extrajudicial killings of the accused.\n\nDespite the ANC later acknowledging the adverse findings of the Motsuenyane Commission of Inquiry into these abuses, the organisation demurred from taking appropriate action against those fingered for wrongdoing.\n\nThis, reportedly, was because its chief rival, the National Party, \u201chad no such policy in place with regard to abuses committed by its members\u201d.\n\nYes, in 1993, a year before it came to power, the \u201cglorious\u201d ANC claimed moral equivalence to the Nats.\n\nThis provided significant insight into the ANC\u2019s relationship with the truth, integrity and righteousness.\n\nThe ANC\u2019s newfound \u201csense of purpose\u201d, driven by arrogance, opulence, conspicuous consumption and new standards of profligacy was thus cast in stone.\n\nTo observers, dazzled by Nelson Mandela\u2019s startling aura, the dictum \u201cdiscretion is the better part of valour\u201d seemed irresistibly apposite.\n\nIn the ensuing years the ANC hit the cardinal, and the ordinal, points on the public\u2019s compass.\n\nOn the ordinal end, the ANC has been lionised by its credulous supporters as a saviour and vanguard of the struggle for freedom.\n\nTo these supporters, the ANC\u2019s reluctance to hold senior members accountable doesn\u2019t seem to be a bother.\n\nIt is for these reasons that, despite the hype of it being strengthened, the ANC integrity commission remains a beast with zero dental formula.\n\nOn the cardinal end, the ANC is denounced by the crestfallen for its shameful betrayal of the values it once espoused.\n\nThese are dedicated, selfless members for whom hope still springs eternal.\n\nWith each election, the ANC has found itself increasingly beholden to ill-gotten donations and patronage by powerful corporate interests that, in time, helped precipitate the morass in which we now find ourselves.\n\nIf there is one universally accepted fact in this political turmoil, it is that no ANC leader now is without blemish.\n\nIt is unsurprising, but no less disquieting, that President Cyril Ramaphosa finds himself at sixes and sevens pursuant to the disclosure of campaign donations made to him by a businessperson whose company is implicated in massive state corruption.\n\nThis leak may have emanated from an ANC faction seeking to embarrass or weaken Ramaphosa.\n\nWhatever the source or motivation, it is unlikely to affect public perception of or trust in Ramaphosa. But he is incredulously fumbling his way out of the fracas.\n\nIt seems fair and unavoidable to postulate that the ANC is inimical to, even incapable of, change. ANC unity remains elusive and seems to just be a pipe dream.\n\nI cannot think of a political party in the 21st century that has forced so much sputtering indignation as the ANC.\n\nThe prospect that the ANC will soon appear before the Zondo commission as an implicated party is both chilling and thrilling even to the journalists who have covered and sometimes abetted it.\n\nThe ANC should stop fidgeting and square up with the public if it is to regain the trust and goodwill it squandered under Zuma.\n\nOtherwise suspicions of it being an antimatter to our democratic experiment risk being confirmed.\n\nTo mitigate this the ANC \u2013 and Ramaphosa especially \u2013 needs to make huge sacrifices.\n\nContemporary ANC leaders seem to not appreciate, or forget, that sacrifice for a cause greater than self is inviolable.\n\nIt is widely hoped the recent forced resignations of ANC ministers is not an aberration or a flash in the pan move, but an affirmation of Ramaphosa\u2019s \u201cnew dawn\u201d.\n\nThe irony of her aphorism aside, Suu Kyi once aptly proclaimed: \u201cIt is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa must, of necessity, rid himself of any fear and act boldly even if this risks his chances at a second term as ANC president.\n\nThe corollary of taking bold action could, fortuitously, provide assurance for Ramaphosa\u2019s political survival and longevity.\n\nAt this rate ANC supporters will have a binary choice in the coming elections.\n\nThey can grant the faux glorious movement a chance at redemption and hope to inoculate themselves from outrage fatigue.\n\nOtherwise, by common consent of its exasperated supporters, administering euthanasia to the ailing centenarian ANC seems irresistibly apposite.\n\nKhaas is executive chairperson of Corporate SA.
