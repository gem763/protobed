Typically when an individual purchases something \u2013 like a stock or another capital asset \u2013 and sells it he is required to pay taxes: Capital gains taxes are paid on the difference between what an individual originally paid for a property or investment vs. what it sells for \u2013 at the time it is sold.\n\nIf the owner of the property or investment passes away, however, the person who inherits it can sell it immediately and pay no tax. That is because the cost basis has been \u201cstepped up\u201d from the price the deceased owner originally paid for it to its fair-market value on the date it was inherited.\n\nPresident Obama proposed ending the stepped-up in basis loophole in 2015.\n\nBiden also proposes capping the itemized deductions the wealthiest Americans can take to 28 percent.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act nearly doubled the standard deduction, to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly, which means fewer people have been itemizing.\n\nThe law also implemented a $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, which has harmed residents in high-tax states.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nIn the plan, the former vice president said 12 years of education is no longer enough for American workers to compete for a job that pays a middle-class salary, while noting that attending college is not affordable for everyone. His proposal includes calls to provide two years of free community college or other high-quality training program to working individuals and DREAMers, creating a new grant program for community colleges, investing $50 billion in workforce training and apprenticeship programs, among other measures.\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "The 2020 presidential candidate proposes closing a tax loophole and capping itemized deductions in order to fund the proposal.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
