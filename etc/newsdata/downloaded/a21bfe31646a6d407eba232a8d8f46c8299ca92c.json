She Won't Be the Last", "language": "en", "text": "Millennials are gaining power at all levels of American government: Enter, Katie Hill. Millennials are navigating a rapidly shifting landscape of technology, sex, and power: Exit, Katie Hill.\n\nLast year, Hill was one of twenty millennials, most of them women, who won seats in Congress, increasing the generation\u2019s representation sixfold in one cycle and giving voice to the second-largest bloc of eligible voters. Last night, she resigned after nude pictures of her \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship with a female campaign staffer were released online without her consent, and after she came under a House Ethics investigation for an alleged relationship with a male legislative staffer.\n\nHill\u2019s case lands smack in the middle of the three-way intersection between tech, sex, and power: Technology has changed sex; sex has changed power; and power is newly vulnerable to strains of disgrace that didn\u2019t exist a decade ago. Technology provides new and humiliating ways to document sexual encounters, and all sexual encounters\u2014especially when they involve a public figure\u2014are now subjected to brutal public dissection. Hill may be the first millennial lawmaker to have to grapple with this particularly thorny 21st century code of conduct, but she won\u2019t be the last.\n\n(Hill, who is openly bisexual, admits to the relationship with the female campaign staffer. She denies the relationship with the male legislative aide, and has accused her \u201cabusive\u201d husband of orchestrating the smear campaign amidst their divorce.)\n\nSince millennials live most of their lives online, it\u2019s only natural that their sex lives have gone digital as well, and Hill was no exception. One 2015 study found that, like Hill, 82% of adults had sexted in the past year, mostly with their partners in a committed relationship. But all those sexual messages can be easily weaponized by disgruntled exes or abusers: a 2016 study from the journal Data & Society found that 1 in 25 Americans\u2014roughly 10.4 million people\u2014have either had their photos posted without their consent or else had someone threaten to do so. For younger women, that figure rose to 1 in 10.\n\nThe weaponization of nudes is a 21st century sex crime, one that state and federal officials have done little to address. Hill\u2019s nudes, including one of her combing her campaign staffer\u2019s hair while naked, were leaked to a conservative blog and to the Daily Mail, which forced Hill to admit to the affair and apologize. But for millennials who are young and single in the age of dating apps, leaked nudes may soon become ubiquitous\u2014and could eventually be considered as scandalous as a past divorce or a failed business: just another part of life. \u201cThe only person who seems to have a gripe is @repKatieHill\u2019s soon-to-be ex,\u201d tweeted Rep. Matt Gaetz, a millennial Republican who opposes Hill on most political issues but served with her on the Armed Services Committee. \u201cWho among us would look perfect if every ex leaked every photo/text?\u201d\n\nBut Hill\u2019s case also illuminates the tricky nuances of workplace relationships in the #MeToo era. The cultural reckoning with sexual harassment has cast a pall over many workplace relationships, and especially those between a boss and a subordinate. According to the new code of ethics, consent is impossible when there is a power imbalance involved. But it\u2019s worth noting that in Hill\u2019s case, no victim has come forward to allege abuse.\n\nShe admitted to her relationship with her female campaign staffer Morgan Desjardines (which is unethical and worthy of resignation, but does not necessarily violate House rules because Desjardines is not on her congressional staff) and she\u2019s been accused of having a relationship with legislative staffer Graham Kelly (which Hill has called \u201cabsolutely false,\u201d and which would likely violate new House rules preventing sexual relationships between members and staffers), but neither Desjardines nor Kelly has has come forward to accuse her of any misconduct. There is no allegation of coercion, harassment, or abuse: just the fact of one relationship and the allegation of another. If it weren\u2019t for the photos, Hill would likely have been able to ride this out.\n\nOf course, that raises other thorny questions. Can a relationship still be problematic even if neither party says it is? Is the power imbalance alone enough to make it wrong? It\u2019s against House rules to have sexual relationships with congressional staffers, which is why Hill faced an ethics probe into the alleged relationship with Kelly (which she denies.) Would she have faced the same public humiliation if she were a man? Would she have been afforded the same sympathy? \u201cWe would never be allowed to take the victim card the way she\u2019s taken it,\u201d said one young Congressman. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t pass the \u2018shoe on the other foot\u2019 test.\u201d", "description": "Millennials are gaining power at all levels of American government: Enter, Katie Hill.
