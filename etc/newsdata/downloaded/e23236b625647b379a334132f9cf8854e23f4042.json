Three states \u2014 Illinois, Alaska and, effective this year, California \u2014 have amended their family code to treat pets differently from other types of marital assets.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in statute directing judges to treat a pet differently from any other type of property we own,\u201d a California assemblyman, Bill Quirk, noted in 2018 while advocating the change in law. \u201cHowever, as a proud parent of a rescued dog, I know that owners view their pets as more than just property. They are part of our family, and their care needs to be a consideration during divorce proceedings.\u201d Thanks to Mr. Quirk, since January California judges have been permitted to consider the well-being of the animal, as well as who provided its care, in working out custody agreements.\n\nWhich is how I came to be sitting in my lawyer\u2019s office that day, entertaining the idea of paying $16,000 for joint custody. Ms. Pham said \u201cNorth Carolina may not be far behind\u201d regarding the pets-as-property dispute. In the meantime, though, her legal team had examined other state laws and come up with a dollar amount to try to induce Jim to share custody. \u201cIt will certainly get Jim\u2019s attention,\u201d she said. \u201cIndeed, it would,\u201d I thought.\n\nTo me Zoe was priceless, but even so, $16,000 seemed excessive for an 11-pound geriatric terror ($1,455 a pound!). Heartbroken, I signed the separation agreement that listed Zoe between \u201celectric salt and pepper shaker\u201d and \u201cred bowl\u201d on the inventory of Jim\u2019s property. Then she was gone, living with Jim in a new town 65 miles away.\n\nA few weeks later came another email from Jim: \u201cI am not suggesting I want to do this, but would you be interested in Zoe full time?\u201d Without missing a beat, I replied, \u201cyes,\u201d which led him to disclose that his new townhouse wasn\u2019t dog-friendly. Although our legal agreement was signed and recorded, I took full custody of Zoe. I understood the implications of my \u201cwin\u201d when Jim wrote again, declaring that he wouldn\u2019t pay for any of Zoe\u2019s care \u201cbecause I won\u2019t ever see her again.\u201d Or me, as it\u2019s turned out so far.\n\nI consider myself lucky to spend my days with Zoe now. After years of caring for my parents, both died within months of my and Jim\u2019s legal separation, I needed that little \u201cterrier-ist\u201d more than ever. Smiling more than snarling, and now two weeks shy of 17, she plays a daily game of \u201ckill the squirrel,\u201d where she chases those show-off rodents in the front yard with every expectation of capture. So far, the squirrels are winning. Zoe and I are victorious in our own way \u2014 we got what was best for us, no $16,000 payment required.\n\nNot long ago I spoke with Crista Stella, a lawyer with the Animal Legal Defense Fund. In my divorce I\u2019d belatedly learned the importance of having a prenup, which Jim and I had skipped. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard the term \u2018petnup\u2019,\u201d Ms. Stella said, \u201cbut it\u2019s the best way to avoid custody disputes when the relationship dissolves.\u201d Options include sole custody, joint custody and even pet support (like child support).\n\nDivorce is not for the faint of heart, whether human or canine. I now know how to protect my rights and any four-legged \u201cstuff,\u201d should I marry again. How to protect my heart \u2014 well, that\u2019s another matter.\n\nSteven Petrow is a regular contributor to The Times who often writes about civility and manners, and the author of the forthcoming \u201cStupid Things I Won\u2019t Do When I Get Old.\u201d\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
