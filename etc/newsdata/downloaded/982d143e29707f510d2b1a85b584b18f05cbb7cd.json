I would like to wish them all the best for what promises to be a very exciting finale to Rugby World Cup 2019.\"\n\n\n\nPrevious Rugby World Cup final referees:\n\n\n\n1987 - Kerry Fitzgerald (AUS)\n\n1991 - Derek Bevan (WAL)\n\n1995 - Ed Morrison (ENG)\n\n1999 - Andre Watson (RSA)\n\n2003 - Andre Watson (RSA)\n\n2007 - Alain Rolland (IRE)\n\n2011 - Craig Joubert (RSA)\n\n2015 - Nigel Owens (WAL)\n\n- Compiled by Herman Mostert", "description": "Frenchman Jerome Garces has been appointed as referee for the Rugby World Cup final between South Africa and England in Yokohama.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7987/3f3f148922654fa9a36b3be4a77b27c5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
