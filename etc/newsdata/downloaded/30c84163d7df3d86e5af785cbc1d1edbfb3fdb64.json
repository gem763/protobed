It\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s sick. He\u2019s sick. He\u2019s utterly unfit. He\u2019s INCAPABLE of thinking about anything but himself.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump was heavily criticized after he fired off a series of tweets on the anniversary of 9/11 that criticized the \u201cfake news\u201d media for his low approval ratings and Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell amid fears of a coming recession.\n\n\u201cThe USA should always be paying the the lowest rate. No Inflation!\u201d the president wrote. \u201cIt is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of \u2018Boneheads.\u2019\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the never ending Fake News about me, and with all that I have done (more than any other President in the first 2 1/2 years!), I would be leading the \u2018Partners\u2019 of the LameStream Media by 20 points. Sorry, but true!\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Trump posted a somber photo of himself and first lady Melania Trump standing in remembrance of 9/11 before he kicked off his rant.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
