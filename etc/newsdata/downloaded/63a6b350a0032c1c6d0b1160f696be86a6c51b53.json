Under new rules introduced this summer, clubs hit with stadium penalties were allowed to hand out free tickets to under 14s. Here, every 10 children had to be accompanied by an adult, with the attendance a vocal, enthusiastic 20,333. The official number of visiting fans was just 200, each paying \u00a355 for their ticket.\n\n'Young people really make noise,' said Nuno. 'In the end it's better to play in front of a crowd but the message was clear: let's stop racism. The first half was not so good, but we were very good in the second half.\n\n'We could see yesterday the pitch was not in good condition for football. We had to adapt. Injuries can happen at any time and fortunately there were none for either side.'\n\nIt was a half-time tactical tweak by Nuno that proved decisive, as Wolves trailed to Andraz Sporar's first-half opener at the break and looked shaky at the back.\n\nSporar put his team in front in the 11th minute. Wolves were caught flat-footed by Rabiu Ibrahim's fine pass from deep, and Sporar drilled the ball home at the near post, thanks in part to a slight deflection off Conor Coady.\n\nNuno switched from 3-5-2 to 3-4-3 for the second period, with Adama Traore replacing Patrick Cutrone, and Wolves instantly looked better. Morgan Gibbs-White shot straight at Dominik Greif from eight yards after Jimenez had cleverly slipped Matt Doherty's low ball into his path.\n\nRomain Saiss competes for a header up against Slovan Bratislava's Andraz Sporar\n\nWolves youngster Morgan Gibbs-White is put under pressure by Joeri de Kamps\n\nSlovan Bratislava players celebrate after Andraz Sporar's goal put them ahead early on\n\nWolves defender Willy Boly battles for an aerial ball with Myenty Abena and Vasil Bozhikov\n\nIn the 57th minute, Slovan's most creative player, Daniel Holman, was surprisingly substituted, and Wolves equalised when Saiss pounced on a defensive error and scored from 30 yards, via a deflection off Myenty Abena.\n\nJimenez then claimed the goal his display deserved when he was pushed in the back by Vernon De Marco as he tried to head in Ruben Vinagre's cross, and the Mexican sent Greif the wrong way from the penalty spot.\n\nJota had looked lively as Gibbs-White's replacement but ruined it when he was booked first for a clash with Jurij Medvedev, and then immediately afterwards for a reckless challenge on Vasil Bozhikov.\n\nNuno said the forward had been frustrated at a refereeing decision but warned: 'Don't do it again.' With away games at Newcastle, Aston Villa and Arsenal to follow this, Wolves can ill afford such foolish behaviour.\n\nWolves' Diogo Jota clashes with Jurij Medvedev before being sent off by Yevhenii Aranovski", "description": "TOM COLLOMOSSE AT TEHELNE POLE: Raul Jimenez left the near full house in Bratislava with an empty feeling as Wolves overcame an early goal and Diogo Jota's late sending-off.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/21/20151214-0-image-a-9_1571947706543.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
