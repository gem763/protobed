Now it's about character, clearing the mind.\n\n\"The next two games against Red Star will become even more important, we cannot lose any more points.\"\n\nThe defeat only heightens the feeling that things are not right at Spurs this season, something the manager Mauricio Pochettino has fuelled with his talk of \"different agendas\" in the dressing room.\n\nIt has led to an inconsistent start to the season where Pochettino's men have yet to post back-to-back wins.\n\nThey have even been erratic within games, evidenced against Bayern where they produced their best performance of the season in the opening 35 minutes, only to collapse after the break.\n\nLloris says Spurs have to find a way to become consistent, starting with a tricky-looking Saturday lunchtime kick-off at Brighton.\n\n\"We need to find a solution to find the consistency that was our strength in the last few years,\" the France international added.\n\n\"Since the start of the season we have never played at the same intensity for 90 minutes.\n\n\"As you see we're used to playing in a way that demands a lot of energy and focus, and at this level the opponent punishes you when you start to lose easy balls close to the box.\n\n\"Today we feel bad for the badge, we feel bad for the fans and now it is to show a reaction on Saturday. This game has become even more important for us.\"", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur captain Hugo Lloris knows his side have no room for manoeuvre in the Champions League after admitting they gave up during the 7-2 thrashing by Bayern Munich.
