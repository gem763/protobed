That\u2019s where I made the mistake,\u201d Biden said in the exclusive interview. \u201cSo I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe younger Biden\u2019s overseas business dealings have consumed the last few weeks of Joe Biden\u2019s third bid for the presidency, and they have been raised repeatedly by President Trump in apparent efforts to tarnish his chief rival and sidetrack an impeachment inquiry. The House is investigating whether Trump leveraged U.S. military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to get the country to investigate the family of a political opponent.\n\nJoe Biden and his son have both denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBeginning in 2014, Hunter Biden served as a paid board member of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings, at the same time that Joe Biden, then vice president, was shepherding U.S. policy toward that country. Hunter Biden also later worked as a director and a part-owner of a Chinese investment company.\n\nAD\n\nOn July 25, Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s president to \u201clook into\u201d the Bidens, particularly whether, as vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma. Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry to determine whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to get ammunition against Biden.\n\nAD\n\nAs the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry continues, Trump and his supporters have accused the Bidens of corruption \u2014 in tweets, at a profanity-laced campaign rally in Minneapolis and in an ad blitz worth millions of dollars. The claims are untrue and have been largely debunked, but it remains unclear how much the quagmire of foreign names and overseas business dealings might affect voters who attend Trump rallies and Biden town halls.\n\nEven as the president is enmeshed in an impeachment inquiry, Trump and his allies have repeated false claims and argued that Joe Biden is corrupt, including in an advertisement that CNN and other networks have refused to air.\n\nAD\n\nAt the Minneapolis rally Thursday night, Trump attacked the Bidens in crass, personal terms, highlighting the unsubstantiated claims about Hunter Biden and using profanity to describe Joe Biden\u2019s tenure as vice president.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHunter, you know nothing about energy. You know nothing about China. You know nothing about anything, frankly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHunter, you\u2019re a loser.\u201d\n\nIn the ABC News interview, Hunter Biden said that he had been on several boards, including Amtrak\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI had as much knowledge as anyone else that was on the board, if not more,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a result, the Bidens have been put on the defensive as the former vice president faces a fire hose of accusations.\n\nAD\n\nAnd questions have remained about Hunter Biden\u2019s actions: particularly whether his overseas business associates were more drawn to his legal and technical expertise or to making a connection to his powerful father.\n\nThe controversy hits at the image Joe Biden is presenting of himself as he tries to become president. On the campaign trail, he repeatedly tells voters he spent decades as the poorest member of the U.S. Senate and boasts of the nickname earned by his modest income: \u201cMiddle Class Joe.\u201d Hunter Biden has refused to say how much he made as a board member for Burisma, but some reports say he was paid as much as $50,000 a month.\n\nAD\n\nA statement released Sunday morning by Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney said he had stepped down from the Burisma board and planned to step down from the board of BHR, a Chinese limited-liability company that aims to invest Chinese capital outside China.\n\nAD\n\nThe statement did not specify what will happen to an equity stake valued at $420,000 that Hunter Biden holds in the Chinese company.\n\nTo avoid conflicts or the appearance of conflict if his father is elected president, Hunter Biden said he would restrict overseas business activity and not work on behalf of foreign-owned companies.\n\n\u201cHunter makes the following commitment: Under a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests,\u201d the attorney, George Mesires, said in the statement. \u201cIn any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJoe Biden, speaking to reporters hours after his son\u2019s statement was released, emphasized that numerous news organizations have found that he and his son did nothing wrong. He said his son\u2019s statement was an example of Hunter Biden doing the right thing and that it was not issued in concert with the campaign.\n\nJoe Biden, who has called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, said the president\u2019s actions were motivated by fear that Biden would \u201cbeat him like a drum\u201d in the general election.\n\nHe also pledged that, if elected president, no one connected with him would work for foreign governments.\n\n\u201cAnd I can tell you now, if I am your president, the next president, I\u2019m going to build on the squeaky-clean, transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd no one in my family or associated with me will be involved in any foreign operation whatsoever. Period. End of story.\u201d\n\nBut in the ABC News interview, Hunter Biden opined that his father\u2019s political career likely played a role in his appointment \u2014 as it has affected many things in his life.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of things that wouldn\u2019t have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden,\u201d he said.\n\nAD", "description": "In a televised interview, the son of Joe Biden said he regretted giving \u201cunethical people\u201d a pretext to accuse his father of corruption.", "authors": ["Cleve R.
