Local analysts have also raised questions about the methodology of JCap's first report.\n\nOn the back of the damaging claims, the company lost 21 per cent of its value in only a few hours of trading on Thursday morning and Monday morning. It is now in a trading halt as the company prepares its second response.\n\nYou can always find unhappy customers and staff and they'll let it rip if they're really unhappy because it didn't go their way. \u2014 Adrian Di Marco, TechnologyOne founder\n\nMr Di Marco said the JCap reports would not only have implications for WiseTech, but potentially the whole sector.\n\n\"It's one of our high-profile, successful companies,\" he said.\n\n\"You have a hard working company here with WiseTech, a great chief executive who is a visionary guy doing the right thing and building a great business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You can always find unhappy customers and staff and they'll let it rip if they're really unhappy because it didn't go their way.\"\n\nOf WiseTech's 12,000 customers, JCap focused on an independent survey it commissioned of 13 customers listed on WiseTech's website. It also spoke to 18 former staff members and executives of companies that had been acquired.\n\nLike Mr Di Marco, co-founder of video technology start-up Shootsta, Tim Moylan, believed this could have wider ramifications for the local industry, particularly for start-ups wanting to list on the NASDAQ.\n\nHe said it was an example of tall poppy syndrome on the global stage.\n\n\"There is plenty of heat on tech companies looking to list in the US,\" Mr Moylan said.\n\n\"Australian tech has been insulated, largely due to the work of Atlassian and WiseTech in buoying our reputation. Let\u2019s hope this doesn\u2019t change that.\"\n\nMr Di Marco said regulatory changes were needed to stop the \"he said, she said\" nature of the shorting process, in which allegations are lobbed and the company must quickly respond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, he did not believe this would have any effect on upcoming IPOs, but issues like this would be a deterrent to founders from listing in the future.\n\n\"You have companies now not just talking about not listing in the short term, but not listing ever,\" he said.\n\n\"It can be so short-term focused it makes it hard to be a public company.\n\n\"Now you have to ask yourself why you're listing, what are the benefits you're hoping to achieve, is it an exit strategy, do you give value to options or is it to raise capital? Ask why and think about the alternatives because it shouldn't just be the natural thing to do.\"\n\nManaging partner at Australian venture capital fund AirTree Ventures, Craig Blair, said he had no insight into the veracity of the JCap reports, but warned that the rush of nervous investors jumping ship at the first whiff of trouble, was a reason some tech companies were wary of going public.\n\nHe said he supported the presence of short sellers in the market, and that all company CEOs understood they were out there when they decided to go public. However, he feared that the sell-off could indicate that some investors were very willing to buy into the ethos that everything tech-related was a bubble.\n\n\"There are companies like Peloton and WeWork that were actually never really tech companies in the first place, but their valuations plummet and there is a risk that some investors start to mentally bundle them up with all technology companies, which have stronger fundamentals,\" Mr Blair said.\n\n\"The short-term trouble must be terrible for the people in the company being shorted, but in a growth company, hopefully you have backers who are long-term investors, and are seeing through the short and medium term to make their own decisions.\"", "description": "WiseTech has lost 20 per cent of its value in only a few hours of trade thanks to two research reports from US firm J Capital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9141%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_78%2C$y_69/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1ed7e76987dfa68de9a84c6d10e667a449cb5890", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
