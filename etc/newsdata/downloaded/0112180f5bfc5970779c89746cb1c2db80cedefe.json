Too cold and the more nuanced flavours can be lost altogether, however too warm and you\u2019ll obviously not enjoy it either.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve seen a rise in the number of people installing wine fridges into their kitchens, not everyone has the money or space for such an investment. Thankfully there\u2019s a much cheaper alternative \u2013 the humble wine cooler.\n\nFor lighter whites such as pinot grigio, it\u2019s recommended you serve it anywhere between 7-10C, while your more full-bodied styles (perhaps an oaky chardonnay for example) only need a light chill between 10-13C. Champagne and other sparkling wines are best enjoyed a little cooler, 6-10C will bring them out at their best.\n\nWhen considering which wine cooler is best for you, think about whether you\u2019re prepared to add ice or if you\u2019d rather the device work without. Those with more space might want to consider one of the larger coolers which can hold more than one bottle, or perhaps a free-standing style would be better if you\u2019re looking to maximise countertop space.\n\nWe\u2019ve also included options for taking out with you when on the move (think picnics or barbecues) as well as electric options if you\u2019d like to get really scientific. Finally, we considered style, searching for coolers that you\u2019ll be proud to have out on display.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.
