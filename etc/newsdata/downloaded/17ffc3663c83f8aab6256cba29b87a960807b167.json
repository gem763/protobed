Here's our verdict.\n\n1. Boris Johnson struggled against Jeremy Corbyn\n\nPMQs is an adversarial event in which the prime minister and leader of the opposition hope to land blows on each other, hoping to seem more authoritative and hammer home messaging which will stick in the mind of the public.\n\nMany of his colleagues had expected that Johnson would cruise to victory against Jeremy Corbyn, who often struggled even against the relatively weak performances of Theresa May. But the prime minister struggled in his first-ever encounter with Corbyn.\n\nThe Labour leader asked Johnson repeated questions about his government's refusal to disclose the information has received from civil servants about the negative effects of a no-deal Brexit. Johnson was also questioned intensively about a Telegraph report which indicated that the government's Brexit negotiating strategy was \"to run down the clock.\"\n\nWatch one of the exchanges here:\n\nJohnson at times tried and failed to change the subject, resorting to jibes, including labeling Labour's spending policy as \"shit.\"\n\n2. Conservative rebels will be a huge thorn in Johnson's side\n\nJohnson unceremoniously kicked out 21 Tory MPs from the party last night after they voted with Labour to vote for a plan which could make a no-deal Brexit illegal. The group included Philip Hammond, who was Chancellor until a few weeks ago, David Gauke, the former justice minister, and Ken Clarke, a former Chancellor and the longest-serving MP in the House.\n\nBut despite being expelled from the party, most of the MPs sat stubbornly on the Conservative benches \u2014 where they reportedly plan to stay. Ken Clarke, alongside Theresa May, sat in the same seat for which he has sat for many years in an act of defiance against the prime minister.\n\n3. Johnson is gearing up for an election\n\nJohnson has insisted for the last two days that he doesn't want an election, despite senior government officials briefing journalists that one would be inevitable if MPs moved to make a no-deal Brexit illegal \u2014 which they did last night.\n\nHowever, he made a revealing slip when he went off script in prime minister's questions, accidentally saying: \"I want an election,\" before correcting himself.\n\nHe will try to seek a general election as early as this evening.\n\nThe problem is that Johnson will need two-thirds of MPs to vote in favour of an election, and Labour have confirmed they will vote against one until no-deal legislation has passed, which could be as early as next week.\n\nThat will force Johnson to try other means of forcing an election later this week.\n\n4. Johnson gives an election preview\n\nThe UK looks to be heading for an election, and Downing Street already appears to have drawn the battle lines on which it will fight the campaign, with pledges to take Britain out of the EU, as well as toughening up on crime and improving schools.\n\nThat was on show at Prime Minister's Questions, with Johnson hammering home his administration's key messages: Brexit will happen on October 31, the government will increase spending on education and put 20,000 more policemen on the streets, even though he appeared to be on the back foot for much of the exchanges.\n\nThe prime minister's chief of staff Dominic Cummings ran the Vote Leave campaign to leave the EU in 2016, which pulled off an unlikely referendum victory by hammering home a series of populist anti-Brexit messages, including the contested claim that the UK sends \u00a3350 million a week.\n\nBoth the prime minister and his team know the strength of simple populist messages, repeated tirelessly by the prime minister and his colleagues, and that will form a key plank of their election strategy \u2014 one which they hope can win them a majority.\n\n5. Johnson's history of racist comments came back to haunt him\n\nLabour MP Tan Dhesi received a standing ovation when he accused Johnson of making \"derogatory and racist\" remarks\" about Muslim women and declaring \"open season\" on ethnic minorities. It is proof that Johnson, who last year compared Muslim women who wear burkas to \"letter-boxes,\" will face constant reminders of his track record of racist, homophobic, and sexist comments.\n\nWatch the exchange below.", "description": "What we learned from the first weekly clash between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d6fbc8e2e22af39cd7a6834?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
