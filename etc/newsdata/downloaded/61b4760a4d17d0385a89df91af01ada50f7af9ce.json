But don't let the public kissing all over Los Angeles fool you: Simpson and Cyrus are absolutely not dating and don't plan to, Entertainment Tonight reports. They're just hooking up, which they've done before, and that's all Cyrus wants to do with anyone right now.\n\n\"Miley wants to show people she isn\u2019t willing to change to satisfy others,\" a source told the outlet. \"She wants to be open and honest and hook up with whomever she pleases. Right now, Cody is that person.\" (Cyrus just broke up with Kaitlynn Carter two weeks ago and last month, she and Hemsworth announced their separation after less than a year of marriage and 10 years of dating on and off.)\n\nThe source explained that Cyrus and Simpson do like each other and go way back. Their relationship isn't about to become anything more than a friends with benefits situation. \"Miley and Cody have been friends for years. They have hooked up in the past,\" the source explained. \"Cody and Miley have no plans to start dating each other exclusively. They both just want to have fun and are open and honest with each other about that.\"\n\nFurthermore, Simpson is about playing the field these days. \"Cody\u2019s friends would describe him as a 'player,'\" the source said. \"He adores Miley, but isn\u2019t looking for a lifetime partner or even a girlfriend at the moment.\" And that's just fine with Cyrus, the source said: \"He is safe to her because they have been friends for years, and she feels no pressure at all.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"She wants to be open and honest and hook up with whomever she pleases.\"", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P4p8DUeuE0lKIA_c.cGyJQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/d0dbb26b86889a5b40b10dddf8bd0bbb", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
