The man strangling the female would stop once in a while and the female would eventually gasp for air,\" wrote Assistant District Attorney Heather Nobrega in the document.\n\nSmith, who lives in Anchorage, was born in South Africa, police say.\n\n\"With the SD card, one of the first questions that detectives had to answer was, 'Was this staged, or did this really happen?' \" said Anchorage police spokesman MJ Thim. \"When they were able to determine that this was an actual crime, then the investigation started to quickly speed up.\"\n\nAfter further investigation, detectives matched hotel records from a Marriott in downtown Anchorage with the saved dates on the images and videos. \"The carpet in the images and videos matches this hotel's carpet,\" prosecutors wrote in the document.\n\nDays later, police received a call from a resident who had found human remains on a highway about a 20-minute drive away from the downtown Marriott.\n\nDetectives obtained a search warrant for the phone records of Smith and authorities say it pinged exactly at the location where investigators had discovered the remains of a woman believed to be the victim depicted in the images and videos on the SD card.\n\nOne photo on the memory card shows a black pickup truck, with part of the vehicle's license plate visible, according to prosecutors. Authorities say they connected the pickup truck with a license plate containing those numbers to Smith.\n\nThere were seven images of the woman \"lying face down on what appeared to be a black bed of a truck,\" prosecutors wrote in the charging document.\n\nDuring a court appearance on Wednesday, a judge set Smith's bail at $750,0000 and appointed a public defender to represent him. Smith has not yet entered a plea.\n\n\"The Anchorage Police Department extends its gratitude to the citizen who stepped forward with the evidence of this crime,\" police said in a statement. \"They played an instrumental role in making sure Smith will be held accountable for his actions. This serves as another example of when you see something suspicious, say something.\"\n\nAlaska Public Media's Zachariah Hughes contributed to this report.", "description": "The card was labeled \"homicide at midtown Marriott,\" and it contained 39 images and 12 videos depicting a strangulation.
