It also includes measures to eradicate sexual and domestic violence.\n\nAdditionally, Buttigieg said he will invest $10 billion to fight sexual harassment and discrimination against women in the workplace. That money would fund measures to make employers accountable for protecting women workers and oversight. His proposal also advocates a law banning forced arbitration in cases of harassment or discrimination.\n\n\u201cRight now, the system places the burden on those who have experienced discrimination or harassment to advocate for change \u2015 often at risk of retaliation,\u201d the policy proposal states. \u201cAs a result, the vast majority of discrimination and harassment never gets reported. Pete will fund oversight and prevention efforts that make it the responsibility of employers \u2015 not employees \u2015 to maintain safe and equitable work environments.\u201d\n\nButtigieg would fund his women\u2019s agenda by closing the so-called Gingrich-Edwards payroll tax loophole, which allows self-employed people to avoid paying taxes into Social Security and Medicare, a campaign spokesperson told HuffPost.\n\nClosing the loophole would bring the government $300 billion in taxes over 10 years, according to Buttigieg\u2019s campaign spokesperson. Former President Barack Obama attempted to close the Gingrich-Edwards tax loophole during his presidency, but failed.", "description": "The Democratic presidential contender unveiled a sweeping plan to address gender inequality.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db19069200000a923506a85.jpeg?cache=sqchqdj7ut&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
