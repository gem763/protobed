The CIA has concluded with high confidence that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi\u2019s assassination.\n\nAD\n\nOn Oct. 2 last year, Khashoggi, an outspoken critic of Mohammed, entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain the documents needed to marry his Turkish fiancee. There, he was killed and dismembered by a team of 15 Saudi agents who had flown to Istanbul on a government plane, according to Turkish and Saudi prosecutors.\n\nAD\n\nA CIA report released in November concluded that Mohammed likely ordered the assassination because of Khashoggi\u2019s highly visible criticism of the crown prince. Saudi officials deny that, saying the agents, one of whom was an autopsy expert, defied orders to bring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia alive.\n\nWhen Mohammed, 34, emerged on the world stage, some Western leaders, commentators and investors considered him a progressive force that would liberalize and open up the oil-rich kingdom that was under strict authoritarian rule. Khashoggi\u2019s death and it\u2019s eventual link back to Mohammed damaged the prince\u2019s glossy international reputation.\n\nAD\n\nIn June, United Nations Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard, appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council, said the killing was an international crime.\n\nWhile the U.S. Senate has rebuked the kingdom for the killing, President Trump has defended Mohammed and said Khashoggi\u2019s assassination should not interfere with America\u2019s economic and strategic ties to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAD\n\nEleven Saudi suspects are on trial for Khashoggi\u2019s murder, though transparency surrounding those court proceedings remain murky.\n\nThe trailer for the PBS documentary, called The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, set to air on Oct. 1, contains no footage or direct audio of Mohammed speaking. In the video, Smith narrates that he tracks down Mohammed at an electric car race two month\u2019s after Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nAD\n\nHe asks how the killing could happen without Mohammed knowing about it.\n\n\u201cWe have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees,\u201d Mohammed responded, Smith said.\n\nSmith then asked the prince how the agents were able to travel to Istanbul on one of his government planes.\n\n\u201cI have officials, ministers to follow things, and they\u2019re responsible. They have the authority to do that,\u201d Smith quotes Mohammed saying.\n\nAD", "description": "Mohammed bin Salman stopped short of saying he accepts full responsibility for the slaying of the Washington Post journalist.", "authors": ["Assistant Editor", "Foreign Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Pvclg4RQ6knGELuLhiqYQZmojUU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LIFKVMG2IMI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
