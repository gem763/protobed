This translates into a cash shortage of $230 million at the end of September. We run the risk of depleting our backup liquidity reserves by the end of the month,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTo cut costs, Guterres mentioned postponing conferences and meetings and reducing services, while also restricting official travel to only essential activities and taking measures to save energy.\n\nGuterres had asked member states earlier this year to up contributions to the world body to head off cash flow problems, but they refused, a UN official said on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate responsibility for our financial health lies with the Member States,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nNot including what it pays for peacekeeping operations, the UN\u2019s operating budget for 2018-2019 is close to $5.4 billion, with the United States contributing 22 percent.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "The United Nations (UN) is running a deficit of $230 million, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said adding it may run out of money by the end of October.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5d9c3486ba492.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
