The police are investigating the possibility that a third person might have suffered the same fate.\n\nCases of two counts of murder and kidnapping have been opened for investigation and a manhunt is already underway.\n\nAnyone with information that can assist the police in the investigations is requested to contact the nearest police or may call the Crime Stop number 086 001 0111.", "description": "Two men have been killed in what appears to be mob justice-related murders in Limpopo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5442/76744ef7a10d4ad9b3459a92a0a70a57.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
