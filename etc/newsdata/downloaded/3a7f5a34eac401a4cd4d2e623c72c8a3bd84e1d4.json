E.U. leaders have said they do not want to haggle over the complex legal details in person with Johnson. British lawmakers passed a law requiring Johnson to ask to delay the Oct. 31 Brexit date if a deal to ease the exit isn\u2019t in place by Saturday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs things stand, we could not support what is being suggested,\u201d said Arlene Foster, the leader of the key Northern Ireland Democratic Unionist Party, a key Johnson ally, in a statement.\n\nEuropean diplomats said they were becoming more pessimistic about the chances of a deal, because a promised legal draft of the agreement still had not been given to them to read over before leaders gathered in the afternoon.\n\nAddressing a group of Conservative lawmakers a day earlier, Johnson compared the negotiations to climbing Mount Everest. Bim Afolami, a lawmaker at the meeting, said Johnson claimed they were close to the summit, but \u201cit\u2019s still shrouded in cloud. But we can see it and we will get there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAccording to people briefed on the talks, Johnson was willing to make a slew of concessions in the interest of fulfilling his promise to get Britain out of the European Union this month \u2014 and perhaps at any cost.\n\nAD\n\nNot only does he have to strike a bargain that can get the approval of 27 other E.U. countries \u2014 itself a difficult task \u2014 but he then must sell it at home. British domestic politics can be unforgiving. Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, made a deal with Brussels only to have it defeated three times in Parliament.\n\n\u201cI want to believe an agreement is being finalized and that we will be able to endorse it tomorrow,\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been tough on Britain in previous rounds of Brexit discussions, said at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel late Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nBut they were running out of time. Before the two-day summit begins, representatives from each of the E.U.\u2019s 27 remaining member states will want to digest any deal and make recommendations to their leaders. In Europe\u2019s consultations, where not all leaders speak English, even translations sometimes need to be given time.\n\nAD\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk told a Polish broadcaster that the \u201cbasic foundations of an agreement are ready\u201d and \u201ctheoretically [on Thursday] we could accept this deal with Great Britain.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is going in the right direction,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cBut you will have noticed yourselves that with Brexit, and above all with our British partners, anything is possible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe key sticking point in the closed-door talks in Brussels has been what happens to the border between Northern Ireland, which will leave with the rest of the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, which will remain a member of the E.U.\n\nRight now, the boundary is mostly invisible. Both sides want to keep it that way, to preserve the peace of the Good Friday Agreement \u2014 but they have differed over how to achieve it, with Britain going in one economic direction and the E.U. going in another.\n\nAD\n\nUnder the current deal, Northern Ireland would remain aligned with most E.U. rules so that the border could stay open. Eventually, Northern Ireland lawmakers could vote to move closer toward the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nAD\n\nFoster of the DUP, who has become a key person in the bargaining, has said she wants more of a role for her party in determining that future.\n\nThe remaining 27 E.U. countries, meanwhile, want to make sure that differences in the tax systems between the E.U. and Northern Ireland don\u2019t encourage smuggling or other behavior that takes advantage of the situation.\n\nBooth reported from London.\n\nAD", "description": "As leaders gathered, a key Northern Ireland party and Johnson ally said it wouldn\u2019t support a draft deal.", "authors": ["Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe", "William Booth", "London Bureau Chief", "Quentin Ari\u00e8s"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qI4OOisuadIIOHD9wYnBn1hCKak=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H7VTL7HQW4I6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
