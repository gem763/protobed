Due to the operation having gone haywire, he misses Bex\u2019s mental health appointment.\n\nSonia (Natalie Cassidy) is horrified when she sees the extent of Martin\u2019s injuries, and demands that he go to A&E to get sorted out. However, he refuses to do so, which results in Sonia berating him for his lack of consideration for Bex.\n\nWill Martin continue to work with Ben? Or will this attack prove to be the wake-up call he needs to call his alliance with the young man a day?\n\nIf he decides on the latter option, the biggest question is: will Ben allow Stacey to come home?\n\nOne to watch: Thursday 17th October at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Will this prove to be the wake-up call Martin needs?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18685203-high_res-eastenders-october-december-2019-ccb3_1570006247.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
