It is shocking that Transnet already wrote of R500m of bad debt in the previous financial year,\" said its general secretary Steve Harris.\n\nHarris noted that the government had also given the SABC a R2.1bn bailout despite the fact that the public broadcaster continued to battle with revenue and the collection of TV license levies.\n\nHe said that, in the case of the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa), money was being taken from Prasa's budget and given to South African National Roads Agency.\n\nOn Tuesday, Parliament\u2019s Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises will be briefed by the office of the Auditor General on the audit outcomes and financial statements of state-owned companies. The committee will also get a briefing by the department of public enterprises on its annual report and financial statements for 2018/19 financial year.", "description": "The United National Transport Union has called on government to stop taking money from one state-owned company to finance another.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6587/d316aa01f97744978eb21cfb054f29bf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
