Pictured: A box of Maximum Strength Zantac tablets at a pharmacy in Miami Beach, Florida\n\nThe FDA did say its low-heat testing method found much lower levels of NDMA than a higher temperature method used by a third-party laboratory.\n\nNDMA was formerly used in the production of liquid rocket fuel and additives for lubricants, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nHowever, after several lab tests, it was classified as probable human carcinogen.\n\nZantac is the fourth leading antacid tablet and, as of 2018, was worth an estimated $128.9million.\n\nSeveral pharmacy chains have announced that they are suspending sales of Zantac due to the troubling findings.\n\nThis includes CVS Health Corp, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Rite Aid Corp, most of whom say the drug can be returned the store for a refund.\n\nMany grocery stores are still selling the drug, but Kroger recently announced it won't be, according to USA TODAY.\n\nHowever, the drug's maker Sanofi - headquartered in Paris, France - said it will continue to ship Zantac to the US.\n\nFor heartburn sufferers, health experts recommend using alternatives such as Nexium or Prilosec, or their generic versions, all of which retail around the same price.\n\nThis is not the first that NDMA has been found in common medications.\n\nLast year, the FDA began investigating whether NDMA and other impurities were in blood pressure and heart failure medicines called Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers.\n\nSeveral recalls were issued and the FDA advised that anyone taking the drugs should continue to do so because the risk of cancer was much lower than risks of suddenly stopping the drug.\n\nThe agency is still investigating this issue and, last month, it sanctioned a manufacturing plant in India that makes some of the ingredients used in ARBs.\n\nUS and European health regulators said last month they were reviewing the safety of ranitidine, while Canada requested makers of the drug to halt distribution as it gathers more information.\n\nThe FDA on Wednesday asked ranitidine makers to conduct their own laboratory testing to assess levels of the impurity and to send samples of their products for testing by the agency.", "description": "On Wednesday, the US Food and Drug Administration announced it found 'unsafe levels' of NDMA, which is classified as a probable human carcinogen, in heartburn drugs such as Zantac.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/18/19207820-0-image-a-2_1570036710884.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
