Carol Danvers becomes one of the universe\u2019s most powerful heroes. When a galactic war between two alien races reaches Earth, Danvers finds herself and a small cadre of allies at the center of the maelstrom.\n\nWHAT WE THOUGHT:\n\nCaptain Marvel left me feeling like I had just netted the winning goal in a world cup final; like when you kiss someone who you think is the bee's knees, or like eating that one thing you've been craving for (what feels like) years. When a movie brings me that kind of elation, words kind-of leave me so much so that when someone asks me how it was all I can reply with: \"It was so flipping awesome\" because the high is almost overwhelming and my critical analysis skills totally misfire.\n\nI processed my multitude of emotions, after the euphoria died down, and I realised that I gobbled this movie up with such glee because I wanted a strong female lead in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) for so long that I had almost given up. So, to finally have one was stupefying enough but coupled with the fact that it is funny, smart and entertaining, on all levels, was electrifying.\n\nI loved it because it brings in the comedy of the first Iron Man, showcases some serious ass-kicking action like Thor and incorporates the coolness of Black Panther into one brilliant package. I'm not saying that it's an imitation of those films' best parts, I am saying that it takes my favourite things about a world that I have loved for a good chunk of my adult life and reinterprets them in a way that I connected with on another level.\n\nThe luminous heart of this film (and who makes it so brilliant) is Brie Larson, whose performance is one of the best I've seen from a Marvel protagonist. She just fits. The last time I felt like this I was watching Robert Downing Jr as Iron Man for the first time. I totally agree The Los Angeles Times' Kenneth Turran who said in his glowing review: \" Not only did Larson train for nine months to get her strength to where it needed to be, she seems to embody her character completely, bringing her hopes, her spirit and her lively insouciance to life.\" She's everything I wanted and more from a character that I am admittedly in love with after reading the comics.\n\nI also must commend the writers of this screenplay including Geneva Robertson-Dworet, Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve among others, for taking one of the most complicated origin stories to make it to the big screen and making it action packed, easy to follow and a fun ride with a rewarding payoff. If you're a bit of nerd and want to unpack those origins, this video is a helpful source.\n\nAnother highlight of mine was the music. The soundtrack is the stuff of sonic dreams. It's pure 90's alternative nostalgia as each song played the people I was watching with audibly expressed delight. Each track's lyrics tied to the moment.\n\nGo watch this movie, everyone. Take friends. Bring your neighbours. It should be awarded for being a movie that is head and shoulders above my expectations, which weren't low.", "description": "The luminous heart of this film is Brie Larson whose performance is one of the best I've seen from a Marvel protagonist.", "authors": ["Alex Isaacs"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6892/350c3279aafe40d08fbd76544ff50bfd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-01"}
