The notion of tens and thousands of hovering low-earth orbiting satellites in the near future may sound like a traffic controller\u2019s nightmare. One satellite startup CEO believes space is a \u201cshared resource\u201d and calls for regulations to level the playing field.\n\n\u201cAs a startup, you think that we would not want to be regulated. That's sort of anathema \u2014 you want to push the limits and do everything you can, but it's a shared resource,\u201d said Adrian Steckel, CEO of OneWeb, on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Ticker.\n\nIN SPACE - FEBRUARY 8: In this handout photo provided by SpaceX, a Tesla roadster launched from the Falcon Heavy rocket with a dummy driver named \"Starman\" heads towards Mars.

But he pointed out that his satellites travel at 16,800 miles per hour. He said at that speed, satellites are \u201cgoing to shatter\u201d and the debris left from the crash will \u201cspoil that space for everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody needs sort of fair rules, and understanding that everybody plays by the rules to preserve that\u2026 Because it's not that I spoil it for myself, I spoil it for everybody,\u201d he added.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 03: OneWeb CEO Adrian Steckel speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2019 at Moscone Convention Center on October 03, 2019 in San Francisco, California.

Its endgame? To bring high-speed internet to the world, including the arctic.\n\nTo get ahead of this race, the startup must be able to scale as quickly as possible. The good news is that costs of production are falling.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that a geosatellite would cause $250 million \u2014 we've gotten those costs down to a million, and that's going lower,\u201d said Steckel. \u201cLaunch costs are also coming down,\u201d he added.\n\nWith Blue Origin right across the road, OneWeb\u2019s factory at Cape Canaveral has its sights on the competitor, and is churning out satellites at speed. Steckel said he owes their ability to scale to robotization.\n\n\u201cIt's really changing the entire supply chain of the industry... It's not the same as going to a supplier and saying, oh, I want five or 10 of that over a period of 18 months,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's saying, no, I want 650 or 1,000 of those.\u201d\n\nOneWeb currently has filings at the ITU for up to 6,000 satellites.\n\n\u201cIt's a scale game. It's a scale game for SpaceX, for us, for Amazon (AMZN).\u201d\n\nGrete Suarez is producer at Yahoo Finance for YFi PM and The Ticker.
