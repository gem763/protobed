We tracked them down to their fragile Hampstead habitat\u2026\n\nIn her speech to the Tory conference last week the home secretary, Priti Patel, pledged to \u201cend the free movement of people once and for all\u201d. The applause was lacklustre but she could barely contain her glee as she added, as a daughter of immigrants, she would take no lectures from the \u201cnorth London metropolitan liberal elite\u201d.\n\nThat brought resounding cheers. Ending a freedom is rarely an inspirational cause, but identifying a scapegoat can often stir the spirits. Of course, it\u2019s discordant to hear senior politicians disparage elites, in much the same way that it would be confusing if Kim Kardashian condemned the cult of celebrity.\n\nBut leaving that minor issue aside, who are these people Patel doesn\u2019t need lectures from? Presumably she wasn\u2019t referring to her boss, Boris Johnson, who, before the break-up of his marriage, lived in Islington in north London for many years, boasted of his metropolitanism and liberalism while mayor of London, and as a graduate of Eton and Oxford knows a thing or two about economic and educational elitism.\n\nSo if not people like the prime minister, then whom? Three years ago Theresa May gave more clues to that answer, when she promised to attack the metropolitan liberal elite in her keynote speech to the Tory conference. Or at least, that\u2019s what the Daily Mail said she would do, helpfully defining May\u2019s target as \u201cthe well-heeled group of London \u2018intellectuals\u2019 which is used to having everything its own way\u201d.\n\nBut May said nothing about metropolitan liberals; she warned of people in positions of power who had more in common with international elites than with the average person, and concluded that if you believe you\u2019re a citizen of the world, \u201cyou\u2019re a citizen of nowhere\u201d.\n\nIn many respects, Patel was merely delivering on what May had alluded to. The division they both sought to mark out was between those who wanted to end the free movement of people \u2013 mainly those who voted to leave the EU \u2013 and a well-educated urban class that they claim is oblivious to the social currents created by this freedom.\n\nDavid Goodhart is author of the book The Road to Somewhere, which argued that Britain is split into three groupings: Somewhere, the half of the population that feels rooted to a particular community and the security it affords; Inbetweeners; and Anywhere \u2013 20-25% of people who are mobile, socially liberal, well educated and, according to Goodhart, overrule majority attitudes.\n\nPlay Video 0:31 'The party of law and order': Priti Patel addresses the Conservative party conference \u2013 video\n\nHe believes the Anywhere group, which loosely approximates to a metropolitan liberal elite, is fixated on economic benefits to the exclusion of social and cultural unease.\n\n\u201cThat is why the north London liberal elite don\u2019t get it on notions of meaning, respect, status,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t get the psychology of Brexit. They don\u2019t get the psychology of rapid social change and why it makes people uncomfortable. Or they immediately default to [attributing it to] xenophobia and nativism.\u201d\n\nAs the founding editor of Prospect magazine, and an Islingtonite who was a Marxist at Eton, Goodhart was undoubtedly a member of the north London metropolitan liberal elite. But in recent years, increasingly at odds with his friends and peers, he has relinquished his membership of what he calls the \u201cliberal tribe\u201d.\n\nLike an anthropologist with an Oyster card, I begin my search for this tribe outside Waterstones in Hampstead. Home to Sigmund Freud, Michael Foot and Stephen Fry, Hampstead has long been a byword for intellectual, free-thinking liberalism. But how unconstrained is that free-thinking?\n\nThis elite's been too emotionally unintelligent about how its priorities aren't shared by many perfectly decent citizens David Goodhart\n\nI ask a rather severe-looking woman what she thinks of Patel\u2019s speech and she snaps: \u201cOh no, I can\u2019t stand that woman,\u201d and disappears into the bookshop.\n\nNear the Coffee Cup, a cafe with a history of serving philosophers and politicians, I meet a violinist who\u2019s not prepared to give her name. \u201cWe\u2019re very opinionated,\u201d she says of her fellow denizens. \u201cHampstead is full of highly educated people who don\u2019t hold back.\u201d Are their opinions disproportionately influential? \u201cI wish,\u201d she says, sighing. \u201cIf they were, we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\u201d\n\nA few doors from where the poet Edith Sitwell lived, I encounter a lawyer named Michael Patchett-Joyce, who says he fulfils every category of Patel\u2019s definition. He doesn\u2019t have a problem with it, except when it\u2019s used in a negative sense, in the way the chattering classes and champagne socialism are employed. \u201cChampagne socialism is a pejorative term because there is an inherent oxymoron within that phrase,\u201d says Patchett-Joyce. \u201cIn terms of a liberal elite, I don\u2019t think there necessarily is the same sort of oxymoron. It\u2019s not that far removed from one-nation Toryism, which of course is under big debate at the moment.\u201d\n\nThat kind of eloquence is not typical of vox-pop contributions, which tend more towards the \u201cI\u2019d get rid of the whole lot of \u2019em\u201d school of opinion. And it raises the question of whether it\u2019s a bad thing to have a liberal elite. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad thing if it\u2019s too powerful and not aware of its own power,\u201d says Goodhart. \u201cThere have to be elites. The metropolitan liberal one is a subset of a bigger elite, and one reason we\u2019re experiencing Brexit and Trump is that this elite has been too emotionally unintelligent about how its priorities are not shared by many perfectly decent citizens.\u201d\n\nYet metropolitan liberals are not immune to the discomfort of change that Goodhart ascribes to the Somewhere half of the population. Primrose Hill Books has long been a browsing place for the intellectuals who moved to this pretty Georgian neighbourhood in the 1960s and 70s \u2013 people like Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, Claire Tomalin and Ralph Miliband (father of Ed and David). Stanley Johnson, Boris\u2019s father, used to have an account at the shop.\n\n\u201cMy parents were university lecturers,\u201d says customer Aileen Harvey. \u201cBut it seems like now everyone is a French or American City worker or a celebrity.\u201d Harvey doesn\u2019t like the way the neighbourhood has gone. She thinks Patel\u2019s label was designed to appeal to the \u201cless well-off and less well-educated by saying \u2018Let\u2019s activate that chip on their shoulder\u2019.\u201d The home secretary was referring to \u201ceducated Labour voters\u201d, she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t live here any more.\u201d\n\nJessica Graham, who runs the bookshop with her husband, looks back fondly on the period when Primrose Hill was a centre of intellectual ideas. \u201cWhen I first came here 30 years ago, it was full of academics, journalists and professional people. Everybody cared, read and everybody discussed things. Those kind of people have been priced out of the neighbourhood.\u201d\n\nShe thinks the idea of a liberal elite is an anachronism, partly because in the age of social media and the internet, ideas are less geographically tethered and more widely disseminated. But also due to the effects of high finance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more like a global elite,\u201d she says. \u201cHalf the houses round here are empty half the time. They\u2019re second homes for anyone from a Russian oligarch to a movie star.\u201d\n\nIf these international elites don\u2019t fall within Patel\u2019s crosshairs, it may be because their money is welcome and, on the whole, they\u2019re not critical of the government. A characteristics of metropolitan liberals is that they\u2019re outspoken about how things could or should be. Goodhart sees this as a form of narcissism. \u201cThey\u2019re saying: be like us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it. We\u2019ve gone off to good universities and become middle-class professionals, why can\u2019t you do it? Well, actually because lots of people don\u2019t want to do that and can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nHe may have a point, but the demonisation of the educated classes is a populist trait that is a well-trodden step on the road to demagoguery. It\u2019s easy to mock metropolitan liberals for hypocrisy. After all, they\u2019re often opposed to gentrification, while being the vanguard of gentrifiers. They\u2019re the loudest proponents of multiculturalism while frequently maintaining a distinctly unicultural lifestyle. But even in this age of bovine anti-elitism, it would be the height of stupidity if people who like to visit bookshops come to be seen as the problem.", "description": "Last week the home secretary launched a blistering attack on an increasingly maligned species.
