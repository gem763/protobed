This type of account, which can be set up easily at brokerage firms and may contain mutual funds, stocks, bonds or other investments, allows the owner to designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the assets will pass quickly once the owner dies.\n\nThe advantage most often cited with these accounts is that whatever funds are in them go directly to beneficiaries, without having to go through the probate process. Beneficiaries typically only have to present proof of identity and a certified copy of the account owner\u2019s death certificate to the investment company and the account passes to them.\n\nAnother advantage is that the designated beneficiaries can be changed at any time, and without consequence, up until the account owner\u2019s death. The owner has the right to add or remove names in the event of changing circumstances such as births, deaths or divorces\u2014or for no reason at all.\n\nBut there also are pitfalls associated with these types of accounts, which is why financial experts recommend people do their homework before establishing one. A few of the issues:\n\nLife changes\n\nAs noted, one of the advantages of these accounts is that they can be changed at any time. But one of the disadvantages is that people may not change them when they should.\n\nThese accounts need to be carefully coordinated with your overall estate plan\u2014and updated as life changes. If you fail to do this, family discord and litigation among your heirs could ensue. For example, if two children are named as beneficiaries of a transfer-on-death account, and a third child is born later, that child won\u2019t be entitled to share in the distribution even if all three are named as heirs of the estate.\n\nSimilarly, if one of your beneficiaries is in a high tax bracket and another in a low one, an even distribution of a transfer-on-death account might result in an uneven distribution of your assets\u2014even if that wasn\u2019t your intention when you set it up originally. And if your beneficiary dies before you do, and you fail to update the designation listed on the account, the assets will go into your estate upon your death.\n\n\u201cPeople never get around to changing their accounts,\u201d says Ralph M. Engel, senior counsel in the trusts, estates and wealth-management group of Dentons US LLP. \u201cWhen there are uneven amounts and you aren\u2019t treating your kids equally, it could break up families.\u201d\n\nAnother reason these accounts should be coordinated with your overall estate plan: If most of your assets are in one of these accounts, there may not be enough money left over to pay taxes, debts and other expenses associated with your estate. Your executor may then have to negotiate or go through legal proceedings with the account beneficiaries to access the necessary funds for these expenses.\n\n\u201cIf an estate is more complicated, you don\u2019t have as much flexibility with a transfer-on-death account as you do with a will or trust,\u201d says Roger Young a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore.\n\nSpousal rights\n\nNaming minors as beneficiaries of transfer-on-death accounts also can lead to problems if you die before your beneficiaries reach adulthood. That\u2019s because investment firms won\u2019t release assets to minors without a court order or evidence of a guardianship, indicating that an adult has the legal authority to make financial decisions for the child. As such, bequeathing funds through a will or trust may be preferable if your beneficiaries are young children.\n\nMarried couples can create joint transfer-on-death accounts, but it is important to remember that if one spouse dies the other generally receives full control of the account under the right of survivorship. That means the surviving spouse could revoke or modify the beneficiary designation at any time. It also means beneficiaries won\u2019t receive the account until the surviving spouse also dies.\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t shortchange your spouse by creating a transfer-on-death account in your name only because your spouse may have rights to some or all of the money upon your death, regardless of who is named as the account\u2019s beneficiary. Although details vary by state, a surviving spouse can make a spousal election, which gives him or her the right to receive a certain percentage of the estate\u2019s assets. This percentage is generally between one-third and one-half of the assets. If you live in a community-property state, the surviving spouse may even own half of any account that is in your name only. The value of the transfer-on-death account would be included in this calculation.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that your beneficiary has no right to the transfer-on-death account while you are still alive\u2014unless you have a power of attorney granting that right.\n\nIf you decide to establish a transfer-on-death account despite these pitfalls, experts advise monitoring it periodically. Consider it a part of estate planning, not a substitute for it.\n\nMr. Sloane is a writer in New York.
