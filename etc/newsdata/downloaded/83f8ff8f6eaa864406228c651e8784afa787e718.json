He has a 12-month price target of $12.10 and a neutral rating. He can't recommend it as one to buy, but neither is it worth offloading if you already have some.\n\nMr Ryan and his team have also been turning their collective minds to the issue of plastic pallets versus wood.\n\nThey interviewed 50 American pallet customers and found that most simply didn't want to stump up for the extra cost of plastic pallets.\n\nPlastic versus wood\n\n\"Plastic pallets are lighter, more durable, safer to handle and create fewer blockages in automation equipment,'' UBS said.\n\n\"While these benefits appeal to customers and retailers, a $70 purchase price for comparable plastic pallets versus $20 for wood makes it difficult to justify plastic unless we see a lower loss rate or a higher issue price.''\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt found that fewer than 5 per cent of customers were willing to pay a sufficient premium for plastic.\n\nUBS concluded that the sharemarket may be over-stating the risks to Brambles of a mass conversion to plastic. It said that unless new competition enters the market and forces Brambles subsidiary CHEP to convert, it believes the introduction of plastic in the next five years will be limited to parts of the sector where companies would need to spend only $200 million of capital or less.\n\nBut some other headwinds for Brambles in the United States which caused softness in North America in 2018-19 might persist.\n\n\"A large part of the recent downgrade to CHEP Americas was caused by an unexpected cost increase from plant inefficiencies, changes to retailer behaviour and capacity issues from the roll out of automation,'' UBS said.\n\n\"While the earnings profile looks positive over the next three years, there is a risk that these costs persist.\"\n\nMargin expansion\n\nBut on the positive side, cost inflation has moderated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUBS is forecasting that Brambles could achieve an earnings before interest and tax margin of 17.5 per cent for the CHEP US business by 2021, which would represent more than 100 basis points of margin expansion a year.\n\nBrambles is trading on a forward-looking multiple of about 23 times, which UBS says is broadly in line with its historic multiple, although the slight premium it usually commands over the ASX100 industrial stocks has slipped marginally.\n\nCiti's Jakob Cakarnis is a little more optimistic about Brambles' fortunes. He has a ''buy'' rating and a 12-month target price of $13.30 on the stock.\n\nHe said costs in the US were showing signs of moderating, with lumber prices for wooden pallets remaining subdued and transport inflation receding.\n\nCiti estimates that lumber accounts for 35 to 45 per cent of CHEP Americas' plant costs, and across the industry lumber prices are down by about 16 per cent in the first few months of 2019-2020.\n\nTrucking rates had also been falling, which was a positive development for the company.\n\nBig unknowns\n\nPrice rises pushed through by Brambles appear to have been sticking and the overall market was remaining rational. Citi is forecasting US pallets revenue growth of 3.5 per cent in 2019-2020, made up of 1.5 per cent price growth and 2 per cent volume growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the big unknowns, however, is the US economy, with the sharp sharemarket slide of October 2 and 3 an indicator of how quickly things can turn.\n\nBrambles is a simpler business now after the sale - completed in May - of the IFCO reusable plastic containers business to private equity firm Triton and an arm of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority in February for $US2.51 billion ($3.61 billion).\n\nBrambles acquired IFCO in 2010 for $US1.25 billion but Mr Chipchase and his board decided to offload it because they believed the future returns would be better from the much bigger CHEP pallets operations, and it made sense to pump more capital into that arm.\n\nIFCO had a pool of 300 million reusable plastic containers used in the transportation or display of fruit, vegetables and other fresh produce in Europe, North America and Asia. It comprised about 16 per cent of Brambles' total revenue.\n\nThe separation of IFCO came six years after Brambles de-merged documents company Recall, which was subsequently acquired by US company Iron Mountain.\n\nShare buyback\n\nBrambles is now going through a share buyback with some of the proceeds of the IFCO sale. Around $335 million of shares have already been purchased in an on-market buyback which can extend to $US1.65 billion ($2.4 billion) of shares.\n\nThat should help returns, but it doesn't solve any of the tougher issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Chipchase is accelerating a program inside Brambles to lift the levels of automation in the US operations to 85 per cent by 2021. An extra 17 sites are earmarked to be transformed this financial year.\n\nHe views the step-up in automation as important in extracting efficiencies and having the Brambles operations running in a lean fashion so that any upturn in economic growth can be maximised.\n\nBrambles has deliberately made extra capital investment to bring more pallets into the UK as preparation for all manner of eventualities that could arise from Brexit.\n\nAs a global leader in its industry with the world's largest pool of re-usable pallets and containers, Brambles is heavily dependent on the the growth rates of the world's biggest economies at a time when geo-political volatility has rarely been higher.", "description": "It has 330 million pallets and crates transporting goods in 60 countries but volatility is high in what should be a staid business.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.773%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f9d224d46c8f1fbf4489335a2c092fcd4a738869", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
