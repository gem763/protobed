We want to be transparent about our approach and values.\"\n\nVijaya Gadde, Twitter\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, said: \"We think that a lot of people have a lot of interest in this space, and have a lot of thoughts on how we should be dealing with this content.\"\n\nBut Twitter has not confirmed when they will implement subsequent policy changes.\n\nSam Gregory, programme director at Witness, praised the initiative to consult the public on monitoring deepfakes but stressed that more action is needed.\n\n\u201cDeepfakes are mobilised to get journalists to share false information and to deceive them \u2026 so having journalists who use Twitter respond is a good thing, but it is not enough.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s critical that these discussions are global and include those people who have already been harmed.\u201d\n\nTwitter confirmed changes in policy would focus on policing content which could \u201cthreaten someone\u2019s physical safety or lead to offline harm\u201d.\n\nIn 2018, the social media giant banned pornographic deepfake videos, many of which were edited to feature a celebrity\u2019s face.\n\nGregory told Euronews the company needs to carefully explain the current problem of deepfakes to avoid creating unnecessary panic.\n\n\u201cTwitter need to make this policy holistic and explain more about the tools they are building, how they are going to share data with investigators and how they are going to explain what they see to the public\u201d.\n\nThe announcement of a change in policy suggested to Sam Gregory that Twitter was now \u201ccatching up\u201d on Facebook.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook announced they would be collaborating with Amazon Web Services and academic experts to accelerate the creation of new tools which detect manipulated videos and images on their platform.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously stated that the social network was \"evaluating\" potential policies against misinformation ahead of the 2020 US Presidential election\n\nIn a blog post, Amazon announced they would be contributing up to $1 million (more than \u20ac897,00) in AWS credits to the\u2018 Deepfake Detection Challenge\u2019 over the next two years.\n\nSpeaking at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Tech Live conference, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of advancing technology in making deepfakes but not a lot of good technology in identifying them right now.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Schroepfer said that Facebook had released a set of 5,000 deepfakes that partners could study as part of the new project.\n\nTechnology giant Microsoft and academics from the University of Oxford have also joined the initiative.\n\nIn a statement, Oxford University Professor Philip H.S. Torr described manipulated media as \u201ca fundamental threat to democracy, and hence freedom\u201d.\n\nHowever, the project has faced opposition with some questioning whether malicious actors could exploit Facebook\u2019s dataset and the code that participants create.\n\nFacebook has previously been criticised for its struggles in policing deepfake videos and misinformation on its platform. In May, a digitally altered video of Nancy Pelosi, the US House of Representatives Speaker went viral, which was slowed to make it appear as though she was slurring.\n\nFacebook eventually downgraded the video to prevent it from being shared, but did not remove it from the platform.\n\nMark Zuckerberg has himself been edited in a video to give a powerful speech about his control of users\u2019 data in a deepfake created by the Israeli company Canny AI.\n\nClick on the player above to watch Alex Morgan's report in The Cube.", "description": "Th social media giant is looking at what to do once deepfakes are detected, including whether to label the videos or take them down.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/09/78/1000x563_cmsv2_450bbc9c-321f-5f3d-a4e4-b81a4203fff1-4250978.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
