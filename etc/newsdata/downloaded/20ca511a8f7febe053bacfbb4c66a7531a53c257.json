Not the JAR brooch and Louis XV chair, but the hand sanitizer and the electric toothbrush. We asked stylist Karla Welch about the jeans, sunscreen, and planner she can\u2019t live without.\n\nMoleskine Classic 12 Month 2019 Daily Planner, Hard Cover I get great satisfaction from making my daily lists and checking them off with a pen (I\u2019ve really been advocating pen to paper; I remember things better than if I just enter them on my phone). I have this planner in pink leather; it\u2019s super cute. And I have another one with blank pages that I just write ideas in \u2014 getting them out of my brain and onto the paper helps them stay in my brain. It\u2019s a convoluted process, but it works. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nRay-Ban Wayfarers Every once in a while I\u2019ll buy designer sunglasses, but I\u2019m such a classics person. I wear these all the time: They\u2019re cool, never going out of style, and they look good on my face. I have multiple pairs in tortoise and in black, and I just go between them all. I love them. It\u2019s just \u2026 instant vibes. $143 at Amazon Buy $143 at Amazon Buy\n\nPhoto: Reid, Hilary Joanna Vargas Dawn Face Mask I always travel with Joanna\u2019s masks; she just has a magic touch, and is so legendary. I put them on on the plane, and feel like I come off with a super-refreshed feeling that really lasts. I like the Dawn face mask; I usually use one an hour before I land \u2014 unless I\u2019m on a red-eye, then I\u2019ll fall asleep with one on and it\u2019ll go everywhere. But I don\u2019t really care. $75 for 5 at Dermstore Buy\n\nPhoto: Reid, Hilary iS Clinical Eclipse SPF 50 Plus $44 at Dermstore Buy\n\nI have a pretty pared-down beauty routine. I wash my face with iS Clinical, and then I use one of its many serums, and follow with its lotion. The brand is just so intense and good. I like the GeneXC, and then there\u2019s Hydracool. I jump around \u2014 I have pretty consistent skin, so it\u2019s just part of my routine. I wish I was putting more thought into it, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s that bottle. I\u2019m going to put it on my face.\u201d I\u2019m very much that person.\n\nPhoto: Reid, Hilary Goop by Juice Beauty Exfoliating Instant Facial I maybe do this once a week \u2026 I like that it\u2019s an over-the-counter dose of vitamin C and retinol, and a little scrub \u2014 it all feels great. I\u2019m just having very good results from it. I actually watched one of Gwyneth\u2019s little testimonials \u2014 they\u2019re so amazing \u2014 before I bought it, and was like, I\u2019ve got to try that. $125 at Goop Buy\n\nJennifer Meyer Letter 18-Karat Gold Necklace I\u2019ve just always liked Meyer\u2019s pieces. She really changed the game in jewelry, in terms of like little tiny pieces. She\u2019s the one who did it all. I have a C for Clem, my kid. It\u2019s just a perfect little special piece that I love to wear. $1,595 at Net-A-Porter Buy\n\nx Karla The Stripe Crew I started with making plain white T-shirts, but my whole life I\u2019ve always worn French striped shirts. For these shirts, I wanted to keep the fit of my classic white tees, but put stripes on them, so that\u2019s what I did. And I love them. I wear them all the time \u2014 with jeans, khakis, baggy pants. I would say the look is kind of like a real \u201970s, French crewneck. There\u2019s a vintage feel to them, soft and great. $50 at x Karla Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
