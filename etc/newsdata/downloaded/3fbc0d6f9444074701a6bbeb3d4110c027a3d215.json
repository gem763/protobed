It Did the Opposite", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump was convinced releasing his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 which involved a request centering on Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 and the subsequent whistleblower complaint that set off a firestorm on Capitol Hill would erase any ammunition for House Democrats seeking to impeach him. Instead, it had the opposite effect.\n\nA day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced they would open a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, a memorandum of the July 25 call was released by the White House early in the day. The conversation released confirmed the allegations in multiple media outlets that Trump had asked Zelensky to investigate Biden, his son Hunter, Hunter\u2019s business dealings and whether Biden used his influence to benefit his son.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump told Zelensky. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump reportedly moved to halt U.S. aid to Ukraine just days before the call, there was no mention of aid in the memorandum of the conversation. But for Democrats from all corners of the caucus who had come out in support of impeachment, this was just confirmation they made the right call.\n\n\u201cIt reaffirmed the nature of the conversation, which is that the sitting President of the United States used the full weight of his office to reach out to the President of another country and ask him for dirt on a political opponent,\u201d said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a moderate freshman who flipped a district last fall and endorsed impeachment earlier this week. \u201cSo it reinforced it for me.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s errors were not just limited to mis-interpreting how the conversation would be read. In one grimace-inducing instance, the White House sent some Democrats their talking points on impeachment, which the Democrats immediately leaked to the press. The White House, realizing its mistake, attempted unsuccessfully to recall them via email.\n\nLater in the afternoon, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence provided to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees the classified whistleblower complaint that allegedly related to the phone call, but Congress has yet to be provided with the full inspector general report. The House also unanimously voted to publicly release the whistleblower complaint.\n\nDemocrats given access to the information called the complaint \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201cdeeply disturbing,\u201d and lamented that they were not given access to the full inspector general report. Those who reviewed the material would not say whether the complaint involved information beyond the July 25 phone call.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything about the urgency and the credibility of the issue, and we will press the DNI tomorrow to produce the full report,\u201d said California Rep. Eric Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, after emerging from the secure location.\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify both in an open House Intelligence Committee hearing and closed Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Thursday. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that he threatened to resign if the White House requested he withhold information from Congress without legally asserting executive privilege, although Maguire denied it to the Post.\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday alongside Zelensky, the Ukrainian president denied that Trump had pressured him to investigate Biden. \u201cSo no pressure,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThese developments were the latest to rock Capitol Hill as Democrats find themselves in the unprecedented position of possibly impeaching a sitting President during his re-election cycle.\n\nThe saga has been ongoing since the beginning of the month, when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff announced he had received a complaint from the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general that was possibly related to areas of his committee\u2019s investigation, but that Maguire had not complied with federal statutes mandating he give Schiff the complaint.\n\nReports that the complaint involved a request from Trump to Zelensky centering on Biden sparked a flurry of impeachment calls within the Democratic caucus, culminating in Pelosi\u2019s announcement Tuesday that they were conducting a formal inquiry.", "description": "These developments were the latest to rock Capitol Hill", "authors": ["Alana Abramson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.TCieqaamzgncr054ZKs0A--~B/aD03NDE7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/6c1cf2012875e31a2bef618b7260a6dd", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
