REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi\n\nTurkey, which began a military offensive in northeastern Syria targeting the YPG forces on Oct. 9 after President Donald Trump pulled U.S. troops out of the area, will discuss its next steps with Russia, he told reporters in Ankara.\n\nIf the YPG does not fulfil the agreement to withdraw some 30 km (18 miles) from Turkey\u2019s border, Turkey will \u201cclear these terrorists from here\u201d, Cavusoglu said.\n\n\u201cThere are those who have withdrawn. (Syrian) regime elements are confirming this, Russia is confirming this as well. But it is not possible to say all of them have withdrawn,\u201d he said.\n\nThe YPG is viewed by Ankara as terrorists because of its links to Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey. But the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which include the YPG, have been a important ally of the United States in the fight against Islamic State militants.\n\nOn Sunday, the SDF said it had agreed to withdraw from the 30-km border region it had controlled until the U.S. troops pulled out.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin agreed on Oct. 22 that Syrian border guards and Russian military police would clear the region of YPG fighters over a six-day period that ends late on Tuesday.\n\nThe agreement allows Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces to return to parts of the northern border with Turkey for the first time in years.\n\nUnder the deal, Turkish and Russian forces will from Tuesday start patrolling a section of the Turkish-Syrian border that runs 10 km deep into Syria.\n\n\u201cNow, a Russian military delegation is coming (to Turkey),\u201d Cavusoglu said. \u201cOur friends will discuss both the latest situation on the issue of withdrawal and at the end of 150 hours (on Tuesday)...how will the patrols be, what we will do together, what steps we will take.\u201d\n\nThe joint patrols are to run from the Euphrates River in the west to the Iraq border in the east, except for the Kurdish-controlled city of Qamishli.", "description": "Kurdish YPG forces have not fully withdrawn from a strip of northeastern Syria under a Russia-brokered accord that is about to expire, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Monday.", "authors": ["Ece Toksabay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445845547&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0UD", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
