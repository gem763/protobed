Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in support among Democrat college students, the latest College Pulse/Chegg Election tracker results show.\n\nCollege Pulse and Chegg surveyedover 1,500 college students weekly in order to get a finger on the pulse of the presidential preferences of college students across the country. The results, based on Democrat and Democratic-leaning undergraduates, are updated once a week.\n\nStudents were asked, \u201cRegardless of who you may support in the upcoming 2020 presidential election, who would you most like to be the Democratic nominee for President?\u201d\n\nThe latest update, on October 15, showed Warren leaping to first place with 32 percent to Sanders\u2019 27 percent. This is significant, as Sanders has dominated as the frontrunner since the tracker\u2019s formal launch in March. On March 26, Warren only had six percent support in the poll compared to Sanders\u2019 33 percent.\n\nThe \u201cgender gap\u201d on the two candidates is hitting an \u201call-time high,\u201d according to College Pulse. Among female college students, Warren leads 34 percent to 27 percent, while Sanders leads among male college students with 31 percent to Warren\u2019s 21 percent.\n\nNo other candidate comes close to Warren or Sanders, with Joe Biden (D) falling to a distant third with just ten percent support among Democrat and Democrat-leaning college students\u2013 a long fall from the 22 percent he garnered in March.\n\nAndrew Yang (D) falls closely behind Biden with nine percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), Beto O\u2019Rourke (D), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), with seven percent, four percent, and three percent, respectively. The margin of error was not immediately available.\n\nHarris\u2019s three percent support marks an \u201call-time low\u201d for the candidate,\u201d College Pulse assessed.\n\nThe poll also found that the majority of college students, 54 percent, have an unfavorable view of Biden. Only 45 percent have a favorable view of the former vice president, whose role in the questionable foreign business dealings of his son has been a topic of controversy in recent weeks.\n\nThe vast majority of Democrat and Democrat-leaning college students, 89 percent, have a favorable view of Warren and Sanders, the survey showed.", "description": "Warren is topping Sanders in support among college students, the latest College Pulse/Chegg Election tracker results show.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/GettyImages-1144063021-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
