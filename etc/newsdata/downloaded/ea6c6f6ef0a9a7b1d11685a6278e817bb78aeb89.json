But that's not something that depends on me.\n\n'It's down to the coach to make those decisions and really I have to respect that. Right now it's about not giving up.\n\nLucas Torreira Arsenal stats (all competitions) Appearances - 60 Goals - 3 Assists - 6 Minutes played - 3,691\n\n'You have to continue working hard and whether I'm playing in the starting XI or from the bench I want to give my all for the team. That's the kind of player I am.\n\n'I like to give 100 per cent for the shirt to help my team-mates and to give the fans something to cheer about.'\n\nHis current run of matches is a stark contrast to last season - Emery's first season in charge - where Torriera made 50 appearances in all competitions, including 34 Premier League matches.\n\nHe has stiff competition with newly-appointed captain Granit Xhaka, Matteo Guendouzi, Dani Ceballos and Joe Willock all preferred and looking to make their mark at the Emirates.\n\nEmery is under pressure this season to get results after a satisfactory first term in the hot seat\n\nDani Ceballos has played in every Premier League match so far this season and has two assists\n\nJoe Willock is enjoying his break-out season under Emery with seven league appearances\n\nThe Arsenal boss alluded to Torreira's slightly more advanced role and hinted that he may be getting more game time in the near future.\n\nThe Spaniard said: 'His qualities are that he can give us good pressing, and he can win the ball high up the pitch to give us the possession to score.\n\n'He did that [in the 3-0 Europa League win at Eintracht Frankfurt]. After, we need someone with the ball and in his position, he can help us with the build-up.'\n\nArsenal fans have taken to Twitter to vent their frustrations with Torreira's situation and Unai Emery's tactics.\n\nOne fan tweeted: 'Any manager that looks at Xhaka and Torreira and thinks Xhaka is a better player to sit in front of the defence is a poor manager to me. Not a single fan, journalist, pundit say it's the right call. Nonsense.'\n\nAnother said: 'Alright I get that Emery doesn't like Mesut Ozil but wtf has Lucas Torriera done to him? He was so good last year when used in the right position.'\n\nOne account felt the need to repeatedly write the line 'Torreira is a DM, not a creative midfielder', in an opinion that is seemingly shared by the masses.", "description": "Lucas Torreira has struggled for minutes so far this season at Arsenal and has become all too familiar with the bench.
