Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), said the panel has a duty to \u201cexamine the serious questions raised by these events.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the Committee charged with jurisdiction over U.S. foreign policy, it is incumbent on us to understand fully all the facts, including the circumstances surrounding the delay in U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, the early departure of the U.S. ambassador to Kyiv, the Department of State\u2019s role in these matters, as well as the implications these events may have on U.S-Ukraine relations, and U.S foreign policy more broadly.\u201d\n\nThe senators called on Risch to \u201cpromptly convene hearings\u201d\u2014mentioning specifically testimony from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2014and use all of the committee\u2019s powers to \u201cfully examine these matters.\u201d\n\nWhile committees in the Democrat-led House are moving fast on their investigation, the only movement in the GOP-controlled Senate has come from the Intelligence Committee, which has already heard from the acting Director of National Intelligence and is likely to hear from more witnesses in the near future.\n\nRisch, who replaced former Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN)\u2014a frequent Trump critic\u2014at the helm of the committee this year, has so far evinced no great interest in the Ukraine matter and has mostly advanced the GOP\u2019s current talking points. \u201cThis conversation that the president had with the head of Ukraine is a typical conversation,\" Risch said on Sept. 25, according to Idaho media.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is pretty simple, the former President Barack Obama tapped Joe Biden to review the corruption, report on it... to protect the U.S. funds that were there,\u201d he went on. \"Within weeks after that, the gas company\u2014the heart of corruption in the Ukraine, hired Joe Biden's son for the tune of $50,000 a month, plus his law firm for another $100,000 a month.\u201d\n\nThe committee's majority has released no official statements to date about the Ukraine issue. On Sept. 24, the day that Speaker Nancy Pelosi formalized an impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine news, Risch sent out a press release touting his meeting with the United Kingdom\u2019s new foreign minister. A spokesperson for Risch did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThough few Democrats expected their Republican colleagues to conduct an aggressive investigation into Trump and Ukraine, many had held out hope there would be at least be a few hearings on the issue.\n\n\u201cAt a minimum, we should be having hearings about this,\u201d said a Democratic aide. \u201cAt a minimum, we should be calling Pompeo to testify. That\u2019s an easy thing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s left some of them pining for Corker, said the aide. \u201cHe obviously wasn\u2019t afraid about standing up to the president. We\u2019re losing a lot of those voices committed to accountability.\u201d", "description": "The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen.
