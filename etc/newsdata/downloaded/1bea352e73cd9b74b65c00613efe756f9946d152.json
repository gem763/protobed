REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nLess than a month until Britain is due to leave the European Union, Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party conference in Manchester is festooned with a three word slogan that encapsulates his approach to leaving the European Union: \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d.\n\nHe wants a deal with the European Union to smooth Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc next month, but if he can\u2019t get one in time he wants to leave on Oct. 31 anyway - a prospect that has the many in the business community on edge.\n\n\u201cThe message from business to government is clear: get a Brexit deal done,\u201d said Claire Walker, Co-Executive Director of the British Chambers of Commerce.\n\nThe traditionally centre-right Conservative Party has long used its annual gathering of members, sponsors and donors to promote itself as the party of business, a pledge to set it apart from the leftist opposition Labour Party.\n\nBut this year in Manchester, with a party and electorate deeply split over Brexit, and an early election on the horizon, that focus has shifted onto a promise to get out of the EU, prioritising an end to over three years of political crisis.\n\nThat is at odds with what businesses represented by major lobbying groups want. They say the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal is casting a long shadow over the economy, deterring investment and driving activity overseas.\n\n\u201cBusinesses are adamant that a Brexit deal remains their top priority. The economic fall-out from a no deal scenario would be severe,\u201d said Matthew Fell, Chief UK policy director at the Confederation of British Industry.\n\nPessimism in British businesses rose in the three months to September to the highest level in almost eight years, a survey on Sunday showed.\n\nDEJA VU\n\nBritain has been this close to Brexit before.\n\nAhead of an earlier exit deadline in March, subsequently missed because parliament refused to sanction a deal negotiated by Johnson\u2019s predecessor, firms racked up costs stockpiling components in case of disruption to supply line.\n\nThis time round, the same thing is happening, according to recent surveys.\n\nEven though Johnson has placed more emphasis on planning and preparation for a no deal, spending millions on information campaigns aimed at businesses large and small, firms say they don\u2019t have the details they need.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing the economic impact of the relentless uncertainty in the form of sluggish growth and anaemic business investment \u2013 unsurprising given firms have no clarity on what conditions they\u2019ll face in a mere matter of weeks,\u201d Walker said.\n\n\u201cThe focus of Westminster should be on the practicalities not the politics.\u201d\n\nStill, there is a cost.\n\n\u201cMore businesses are prepared than before, but that does not mean that they are protected from a no deal outcome, especially small firms. And the actions being taken are not positives for the economy,\u201d said Fell.\n\n\u201cFirms have been spending billions of pounds on contingency plans and shifting supply chains, which could be spent on new investments, innovation and jobs.\u201d\n\n(This story refiles to remove garbled text at start of first paragraph)", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to make his priority getting a Brexit deal to protect the economy, rather than wooing voters with a political promises, business groups attending the Conservative Party conference said.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435932737&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9031P", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
