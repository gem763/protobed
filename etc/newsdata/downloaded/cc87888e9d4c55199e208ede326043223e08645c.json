The sales begin at midnight on 11 November and last for just 24 hours.\n\nBut even within that short time frame, last year the event had about \u00a324bn worth of sales. This was up 27 per cent from the previous year.\n\nThe majority of the event happens on the Chinese website Tmall, which is owned by Alibaba.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 7 best fashion moments from Taylor Swift 'Lover' music video Show all 7 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.
