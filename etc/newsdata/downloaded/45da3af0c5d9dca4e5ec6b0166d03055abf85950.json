Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated him and led the cheers of \u201cBanzai,\u201d which traditionally means \u201c10,000 years.\u201d\n\nThe enthronement ceremony is the high point of several succession rituals that began in May when Naruhito inherited the throne after the abdication of Akihito, his father. Naruhito leads the world\u2019s oldest hereditary monarchy, which historians say goes back 1,500 years.\n\nThe short ceremony, which some critics say was largely meant to allow Abe\u2019s ultra-conservative government to win public support, was marked by extraordinary contrasts: the rhythmic shuffle of dozens of court dignitaries\u2019 long, stiff, antiquated robes as they brushed over mats leading to the throne room, to the thunder of cannon salutes reverberating through the palace.\n\n\u201cI hereby proclaim my enthronement to those at home and abroad,\u201d Naruhito said. \u201cI hereby swear that I will act according to the constitution and fulfill my responsibility as the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people of Japan, while always praying for the happiness of the people and the peace of the world as I stand with the people.\u201d\n\nThe ceremony began with the sound of a bell. Naruhito, wearing a formal brownish-orange robe that was dyed in sappanwood and Japanese wax tree bark and a black headdress decorated with an upright tail, then stood perfectly still while a pair of black-robed chamberlains pulled aside and secured the purple curtains surrounding the throne.\n\nThe throne, called \u201cTakamikura,\u201d is a 6.5-meter- (21-foot-) high decorative structure resembling a gazebo. It was taken apart in 3,000 pieces and transported last year from the former Imperial Palace in Japan\u2019s ancient capital of Kyoto, where emperors lived until 150 years ago, and reassembled and repaired with new lacquer coatings.\n\nDespite the time, effort and cost put into preparations, the ceremony lasted only about 30 minutes.\n\nIt was originally modeled after one by the ancient Tang dynasty of China and is the second of three ceremonies that follow the May succession. Next month sees the highly religious and divisive ritual of Daijosai, or the Great Thanksgiving.\n\nWhile the harvest ritual is an annual event that the emperor performs privately, the government funds the first one by a new emperor as part of the succession ceremony. A one-off shrine for the Nov. 14-15 ritual is being constructed at the palace.\n\nHistorians have various interpretations of the harvest ritual that the emperor performs alone inside a shrine that houses a bed. In one theory, the emperor sleeps with Shinto gods from the past, including the sun goddess Amaterasu. In another, the bed is for the god of rice, who comes to rest after the harvest season.\n\nSome experts have raised questions over the government\u2019s funding of 16 billion yen ($150 million) for ceremonies that contain religious rites like Daijosai. Most of the cost goes to a one-time shrine that will be demolished after the event.\n\nCriticism, however, was largely eclipsed by the festive mood, in part because Naruhito\u2019s succession came about because of abdication, not death, palace watchers said.\n\nTo mark the occasion, Abe\u2019s ultra-conservative government granted pardons to about 550,000 eligible applicants. The decision was not publicly debated.\n\nThe pre-war custom of clemency by the emperor, who was revered as a god in those days, has triggered criticism as being undemocratic and politically motivated. At the time of former Emperor Akihito\u2019s enthronement, 2.5 million people were given amnesty.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the 59-year-old Naruhito put on a white robe and prayed at Kashikodokoro and two other shrines, to report to gods ahead of the ceremony. Enshrined at Kashikodokoro is the sun goddess Amaterasu, the mythological ancestress of Japan\u2019s emperors.\n\nRecent changes to the enthronement ceremonies included a slightly smaller structure for the empress, called \u201cMichodai,\u201d or \u201cThe August Seat of the Empress,\u201d where Naruhito\u2019s wife, Masako, stood, dressed in traditional costume. It was first used by Naruhito\u2019s grandmother.\n\nNaruhito and Masako, a Harvard-educated former diplomat, were to host a court banquet later Tuesday to be attended by about 400 foreign dignitaries and representatives from Japan\u2019s administrative, legislative and judicial branches and their spouses.\n\nA parade originally planned for Tuesday afternoon had been postponed until Nov. 10 because of a recent typhoon that caused flooding and other damage in central and northern Japan.\n\nNaruhito and Masako have been warmly welcomed by the Japanese public. They made positive impressions by freely conversing with President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump during their visit weeks after Naruhito\u2019s succession in May, palace watchers say.\n\n\u201cI think people have high expectations for the emperor, who is fluent in foreign languages and internationalized,\u201d said historian and monarchy expert Eiichi Miyashiro, who is also a journalist.\n\nNaruhito, who studied at Oxford, is a historian, a viola player and an expert on water transport. Masako has struggled for more than a decade since developing \u201cadjustment disorder\u201d after giving birth to the couple\u2019s only child, Princess Aiko, and facing pressure to produce a boy in Japan\u2019s monarchy, which allows only male heirs.\n\nA shortage of males in the royal family has raised succession concerns and prompted calls for a debate, possibly to allow female emperors. Naruhito has an 83-year-old uncle and two potential heirs - his younger brother Crown Prince Akishino and a 13-year-old nephew.\n\nAbe and his ultra-conservative supporters insist on male-only succession, while a majority of the general public supports allowing female emperors.\n\n___\n\nThis story corrects the date of harvest ritual to Nov. 14-15, not Nov. 13-14.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Foster Klug contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Three booming cheers of \"Banzai!\" rang out Tuesday at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo as Naruhito formally declared his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne as the nation's 126th emperor.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mari Yamaguchi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/Japan_Enthronement_26972.jpg-65f60_c0-1336-3600-3436_s1200x700.jpg?4dc2fd7c8622f8d6972cc7bcc3fba261327d5072", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
