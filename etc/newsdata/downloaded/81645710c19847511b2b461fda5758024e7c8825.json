Rowe Price New Asia Fund (PRASX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?", "language": "en", "text": "On the lookout for a Pacific Rim - Equity fund? Starting with T. Rowe Price New Asia Fund (PRASX) is one possibility. PRASX carries a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.\n\nObjective\n\nPRASX is classified in the Pacific Rim - Equity segment by Zacks, which is an area full of possibilities. Pacific Rim - Equity mutual funds see big investment opportunities in the dominant export-focused markets of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Korea. These funds also invest less than 10% of their assets in Japanese firms, as Japan mutual funds are very popular.\n\nHistory of Fund/Manager\n\nPRASX is a part of the T. Rowe Price family of funds, a company based out of Baltimore, MD. Since T. Rowe Price New Asia Fund made its debut in September of 1990, PRASX has garnered more than $2.44 billion in assets. The fund is currently managed by Anh Lu who has been in charge of the fund since June of 2014.\n\nPerformance\n\nObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 3.7%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3-year annualized total return of 7.2%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.\n\nWhen looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. PRASX's standard deviation over the past three years is 14.65% compared to the category average of 11.9%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 14.88% compared to the category average of 12.21%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.\n\nRisk Factors\n\nIt's always important to be aware of the downsides to any future investment, so one should not discount the risks that come with this segment. In the most recent bear market, PRASX lost 67.5% and underperformed comparable funds by 9%. This could mean that the fund is a worse choice than comparable funds during a bear market.\n\nInvestors should not forget about beta, an important way to measure a mutual fund's risk compared to the market as a whole. PRASX has a 5-year beta of 0.89, which means it is likely to be less volatile than the market average. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a negative alpha of -4.54. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.\n\nExpenses\n\nCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, PRASX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.94% compared to the category average of 1.48%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, PRASX is actually cheaper than its peers.\n\nWhile the minimum initial investment for the product is $2,500, investors should also note that each subsequent investment needs to be at least $100.\n\nBottom Line\n\nOverall, T. Rowe Price New Asia Fund ( PRASX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, T. Rowe Price New Asia Fund ( PRASX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.\n\nFor additional information on the Pacific Rim - Equity area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.
