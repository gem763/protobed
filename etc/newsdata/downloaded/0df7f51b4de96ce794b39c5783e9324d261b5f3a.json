After a slow start to his professional career, the Geordie hit form in October 2017 with a shock stoppage of Robbie Barrett for the British lightweight title, before enjoying a sensational first nine months of 2018.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Ritson\u2019s usual tactics were not working, the power was not enough and the aggression was met with skill and guile from his Italian opponent, who was completely unperturbed by the emotion of the night.\n\nAfter 12 rounds, it was Patera\u2019s hand that was raised in victory by split decision, while through 48 tough, tough minutes, Lewis Ritson had gone from the Geordie Golovkin to Newcastle United era Michael Owen.\n\n2019 has seen Ritson defeat two very average fighters, which leaves tonight as his first legitimate attempt at rejuvenation. Once again Ritson will be the headline act in front of his home fans, but this time a fellow Brit will be in the opposite corner.\n\nWhile Lewis Ritson enjoyed a year of hype in 2018 that few British fighters have seen, Robbie Davies Jr was starting the year at rock bottom. After establishing a steady, if unspectacular, undefeated record in his first 15 professional fights, Davies suffered his first defeat in July 2017 to Poland\u2019s Michal Syrowatka.\n\nDavies was stopped in the last round of a bruising 12 round contest, despite dropping his opponent in the ninth round of the contest. The defeat was crushing, few fighters with little media attention bounce back from such defeats, and little was expected of the Liverpudlian heading into 2018 and beyond.\n\nSlowly, but surely, he rebounded. An immediate rematch with Syrowatka was successful, with Davies stopping the Pole in the 12th round after previously knocking him down in the third and fourth rounds.\n\nThen, in October 2018, on the same night and same venue where Lewis Ritson lost to Francesco Patera, Robbie Davies won the British super lightweight belt against Newcastle\u2019s own Glenn Foot.\n\nBy the time Ritson had tasted defeat, one can only assume Davies was well en route to enjoying one of the best nights of his life.\n\nAs they say, one man\u2019s sunset is another man's dawn.\n\nBut who will wake up tomorrow morning filled with the light of day? Will it be Lewis Ritson, who has moved up in weight to face Davies, the hometown hero who is loved by his City, both desperate for world class sporting success.\n\nOr will it be Davies, rarely the star, usually the bridesmaid who once again heads to Newcastle and defeats the crowd favourite and moves forward in his career?\n\nBoth are strong, both carry power and both are vulnerable. This could be a 12 round war or an early blowout, and it\u2019s exactly the sort of fight to watch on a Saturday night.\n\nBritish boxing hasn\u2019t experienced enough high level domestic dust-ups this year, but tonight\u2019s Matchroom card is a much needed throwback to the events of previous years with several important fights on the same bill.\n\nCan we have these every week?", "description": "Two of Britain\u2019s most exciting boxers take to the ring tonight in Newcastle as local star Lewis Ritson meets Liverpool\u2019s Robbie Davies Jr in a super lightweight Tyneside grudge match.
