Unlike other sections of our awards, these mascara, shadow, liner, and brow picks aren't based on skin type or hair texture, meaning the products you decide to buy can be based solely on how you want to express yourself \u2014 just for the day or consistently throughout the year. We have six different kinds of mascaras alone for you to sort through.\n\nIf you want to emulate a Euphoria character with the glitteriest shadows and most colorful eyeliners we could find, we have you covered with some Asian beauty imports: the Kaja Beauty Bento Bouncy Shimmer Eyeshadow Trio and the Uz Eye Opening Liner. Or if you prefer the more low-key look of an off-duty model, we recommend reaching for the best neutral cream winner, the Supergoop Shimmershade Eyeshadow, for a subtle wash of color on your lids. You could even draw on flicks with the best liquid eyeliner winner, the Too Faced Better Than Sex Liner. (Yes, it's inspired by that mascara.)\n\nNo matter how experimental or minimalist you prefer to get with your eye makeup, the list below is sure to include all the supplies you'll need to create your desired look. If you're curious about what to use on your cheeks and lips, you can check out our full list of Best of Beauty 2019 winners. \u2014 Devon Abelman", "description": "After trying countless eye products, our editors declared these to officially be the most visionary shadows, liners, mascaras, and brow things (yes, there are now several).
