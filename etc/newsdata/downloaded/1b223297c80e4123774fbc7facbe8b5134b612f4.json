That\u2019s not going to be done because we have challenges over ticketing in a stadium for three days.\n\n\u201cThe problem I\u2019ve got with that is it\u2019s the way our sport is being portrayed by some of the people in that [BBC] studio.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got people whose judgement I do trust, who are saying it would be great if a one-minute 42.4-second run [the men\u2019s 800m winning time] and some great performances were being dissected.\n\n\u201c[The crowd is] an easier subject to talk about rather than some of the more insightful stuff around the events. I accept that, that\u2019s the world we live in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not heading for home on this, we will go on making sure people realise wherever they are in the world this sport is theirs.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThere are places which are going to take longer for us to go to, but people have to believe this sport is theirs, it\u2019s not just rooted in a handful of European capitals.\u201d\n\nPicking the wrong target in @GabbyLogan. She\u2019s just doing her job...brilliantly as always. Maybe look closer to home. https://t.co/54VjMNF0QL \u2014 Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) October 2, 2019\n\nThe BBC declined to comment, but fellow presenter Gary Lineker leapt to Logan\u2019s defence on Twitter, posting: \u201cPicking the wrong target in @GabbyLogan. She\u2019s just doing her job\u2026 brilliantly as always. Maybe look closer to home.\u201d\n\nCoe\u2019s decision to hit out at the BBC may be influenced by an awkward episode that took place last Sunday night, when pundit Michael Johnson described the IAAF president as \u201cfull of s---\u201d.\n\nJohnson was chatting to Logan in what they thought was a break in coverage of the World Championships but their microphones were still broadcasting on a live satellite feed being used by BBC technicians and producers.\n\n\u201cSeb, it\u2019s like, you\u2019re either ignorant, naive or full of s---,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not ignorant or naive - he\u2019s full of s---.\u201d\n\nLogan then appeared to nod and laugh.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coe insisted the athletes competing at these championships have been happy with the decision to host them in Qatar.\n\n\u201cI get to the stadium an hour before the event, I sit with the medical teams, I sit with the coaches, I went to every one of the finalists from the 800m and chatted to them an hour-and-a-half before they needed to get into there,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was on the indoor, the outdoor track, they are not talking about that [the crowds].\n\n\u201cCan I just be a bit blunt about this, the athletes talking about externalities are probably not the ones who are going to be walking home with medals from here.
