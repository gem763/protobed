I hope she didn't mean in a literal sense.\"\n\nLater in the day, Biden brought the subject up again, saying in a speech in Iowa that the United States would need strong alliances.\n\n\"We need a leader who can, on Day 1, pick up the phone to call our NATO allies and there won\u2019t be any question of whether or not the United States will meet our treaty obligations or stand up for democracy and freedom.\"\n\nAfter Tuesday's debate, Warren's campaign said the senator was referring to combat troops and not advocating a complete withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n'ENDLESS WARS'\n\nTrump has defended his reversal of longstanding U.S. policy in Syria as part of a plan to withdraw the United States from \"endless\" wars.\n\nAt Tuesday's debate, Warren criticized that decision as \"impulsive\", but did not explain how her position was different.\n\nWarren's campaign spokeswoman Alexis Krieg said the senator would pursue a more multinational approach than Trump's go-it-alone style.\n\n\"That means working to responsibly remove U.S. troops from combat in the Middle East, and using diplomacy to work with allies and partners to end conflicts and suffering in the region,\" she said.\n\nMelissa Dalton, a former Department of Defense advisor and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Warren's emphasis on diplomacy reflected Americans' fatigue with foreign military interventions after the long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nA survey this year by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a think tank, found that only 27% believed military interventions contribute to U.S. safety, although more than two-thirds supported maintaining U.S. military superiority and some military presence overseas.\n\nBut in terms of addressing the foreign policy challenges posed by China, Russia and the Middle East, Dalton said Warren \"has not yet fully articulated what her vision is.\"\n\nUp to now, Warren's foreign policy proposals have tended to focus on securing better trade terms for American workers, rather than on national security matters.\n\nSince Biden announced his candidacy in April he has posted at least 39 Twitter messages that include variations of the words \"Syria,\" \"Turkey,\" \"Russia\", \"China\", \"Iran\" and \"middle east,\" against at least 23 for Warren, according to a Reuters review of more than 3,500 Twitter posts by the two candidates.\n\nBrian Katulis, a senior fellow on national security at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington, said Warren's statement on Syria left a lot of unanswered questions: \"And how does that distinguish her from how Trump has moved forward on those fronts?\"\n\nThe emergence of national security as an election issue in light of the Syria crisis, and with less than four months to go until the first contest on Feb. 3 in Iowa, puts pressure on Warren to answer those questions, and fast.
