He then confirmed the woman was formally discharged by the court.\n\nThe mother had been excused from attending the short hearing.\n\nWhile no evidence was presented during the criminal proceedings, the circumstances of the case were outlined last year in a separate High Court challenge taken by the woman.\n\nJudgment has yet to be delivered in that judicial review, in which the mother claimed the decision to prosecute her contravened her human rights.\n\nGrainne Teggart from Amnesty International outside Belfast's Crown Court\n\nDuring those proceedings, the woman's barrister told the court her daughter was 'extremely vulnerable' at the time of her pregnancy, claiming her then ex-boyfriend was 'physically and emotionally abusive' toward her.\n\nThe lawyer said the GCSE student had gone to her local doctor a week after taking the abortion medication.\n\nHer court heard she was subsequently referred to a mental health counselling service, which in turn informed Social Services. Social Services then alerted the Police Service of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe barrister told the High Court investigating police officers then arrived at the child's school and removed her from a classroom to speak to her in the absence of her parents.\n\nAfter her acquittal on Wednesday, the woman's solicitor, Jemma Conlon, of Chambers Solicitors, said: 'Today is a day of immense relief for my client, who now finds herself free from the burden of this prosecution that has been in her life for six years.\n\n'It is a day that she will forever remember and a day that allows her to finally move on with her life privately without anguish and criminalisation.'\n\nOutside court, Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty International, which had been supporting the woman, said the outcome was evidence of a new 'compassionate' legal framework in Northern Ireland.\n\n'Today we are relieved that she can go back to being a mother,' she said.\n\nSolicitor Jemma Conlon reads out her client\u00b4s statement to the media outside Belfast Crown Court\n\n'What we are seeing today is our new abortion law taking effect. No longer will women be hauled through the courts and treated as criminals for accessing this healthcare service.\n\n'This is the beginning of a new era for Northern Ireland \u2013 a more caring and compassionate Northern Ireland. This mother is now free to move on from this ordeal and go back to her family.'\n\nMs Teggart outlined the impact the prosecution has had on the mother.\n\n'This has had a devastating impact,' she said. 'Of course, first and foremost on the mother but also on her daughter. She has been used as tool in her prosecution.\n\n'She turned to her mother for help when she needed it. Her mother did what any other parent would arguably have done and provided that help, and she was prosecuted for doing so \u2013 that should never have happened.'\n\nThe Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019 which decriminalised abortion also paved the way for the introduction of same-sex marriage in the region, with the first weddings expected in February.\n\nThe Act also includes provisions for a new pension paid to injured victims of the Troubles.", "description": "A judge directed jurors at Belfast Crown Court to find the unidentified mother, 39, not guilty.
