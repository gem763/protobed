A staffer claimed, \"We had to raise prices between 3 to 13 percent, due to changed production costs, raw material costs and the exchange rate.\"\n\nThe price hikes will also take place in other countries, whereas on some previous occasions only Korea was targeted as a captive market in thrall to overpriced, status-affirming bling.\n\nChanel has usually jacked up prices quarterly every year in Korea, but this year it already raised prices of some 400 skin care and perfume products in January and 462 jewelry and other accessory products in March.\n\nThe brand has long capitalized on the so-called \"Veblen Effect\" whereby luxury products sell better the more expensive they are.\n\nThe millennial generation tends to open their wallets as long as a product satisfies their needs, and this has led to steady increases in sales of luxury products.", "description": "Chanel to Hike Product Prices for 3rd Time This Year", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
