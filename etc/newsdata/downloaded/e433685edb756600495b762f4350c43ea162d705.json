The competition was created in 1992 by the clubs of the now extinct Football League First Divison, looking to increase their power and revenues. In the Premier League, the clubs act as the shareholders. It is also known as the English Premier League (EPL) outside England.\n\nHow the competition works\n\nThe competition operates on a points system and is contested by 20 clubs. During the course of a season (which runs from August to May) each team plays a total of 38 games where they face all the other 19 sides twice (at home and away), being awarded three points for a win, one for a draw and no points for a loss. The team with the most points wins the competition and the three teams with the least amount of points are relegated to the Championship (the second highest league in the English men's professional football leagues' system). The two teams with the most points in the Championship are promoted to the Premier League, along with the winner of the play-offs involving the third to sixth placed sides in the Championship. 46 teams have competed in the Premier League since its inception in 1992, including Welsh sides integrated in the English football league system, but only five have ever won the competition.\n\nSome achievements\n\nManchester United has won the competition a record 13 times, followed by Arsenal and Chelsea with three, Manchester City with two and Blackburn Rovers with one.\n\nManchester United Scottish manager Alex Ferguson has been the longest-serving and most successful manager ever in the Premier League until he retired in 2013. He managed in all of the first 21 Premier League seasons, having won the competition 13 times. Arsenal's manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has won the competition three times and is currently the longest-serving manager in the competition, having started his tenure in 1996. No English manager has ever won the Premier League.\n\nThe player with the most appearances in the Premier League is Manchester United's Ryan Giggs, having played in 632 matches before retiring in 2014, having played in every Premier League season since its inception until his retirement. He is followed by the still active Chelsea and Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard with 592 appearances. Its top scorer is the English striker Alan Shearer having scored a total of 260 goals in 441 matches.\n\nThe Premier League is currently the most-watched football league in the world, being broadcasted in 212 countries to a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people, generating over \u20ac2.2 billion per year in television rights revenue.", "description": "Contested by 20 clubs, the Premier League is England's top professional men's football league.
