Still, a to-do list that includes such prosaic entries as \u201ccheck emails\u201d and \u201cdrop packages at the post office\u201d provides followers with a weirdly detailed sense of familiarity. Why are influencers doing it, and what does our reaction to the lists say about us?\n\n\u201cI compare it to the \u2018What\u2019s in someone\u2019s bag\u2019 celebrity magazine features,\u201d says Olivia Muenter, a 26-year-old Philadelphia-based influencer and writer who recently wrote about the public to-do list trend for Apartment Therapy. \u201cThey\u2019re mundane things like ChapStick and tissues, but there\u2019s something intimate about knowing these small details.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere also can be something disturbing about the lists. The first time I landed on one, I felt a jolt of voyeuristic delight. After two lists, I began to wonder if I, too, had time to organize my desk or record a podcast that day. By the third list, the mythical American work ethic had tied a knot of capitalist dread in my stomach, and I was thinking, I should be working harder.\n\nI\u2019m not alone. \u201cMy typical reaction to seeing these lists on Instagram is a feeling of failure,\u201d says Daley Quinn, a 25-year-old writer in Boston. \u201cSeeing other writers list the millions of deadlines they have that day makes me feel as though I\u2019m not doing enough during my own workday.\u201d\n\nThere are both cultural and psychological reasons behind such a reaction. \u201cThe deeper into voyeurism you go, the harder it becomes not to compare yourself, and comparison is the heart of unhappiness,\u201d says Megan Costello, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles who sees both pros and cons \u2014 but mostly cons \u2014 in reading other people\u2019s to-do lists. \u201cThe fantasy is that if you work hard enough, you will find fulfillment. Even with good intentions, it\u2019s a fetishization of work and consumerism.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo find out the intentions behind the lists, I spoke to three influencers, each of whom offered practical reasons for making her daily to-do list public via Instagram Stories (I\u2019ve only encountered women posting them). \u201cI create lists every single day. It was just a matter of time before they made it to my Instagram,\u201d says Rebecca Norris, a 27-year-old writer in New York City. When she became a full-time freelancer in March, friends and family had trouble understanding her new employment status. \u201cI wanted to share what my job entails, how every day is different, and how it\u2019s never boring.\u201d\n\nThe lists also serve as a bulwark against the popular cultural assumption that millennials and Generation Xers \u2014 who dominate the influencer game \u2014 are slackers. \u201cI have a job that\u2019s treated as a joke,\u201d says Grace Atwood, a 38-year-old influencer, blogger and podcast host with 125,000 followers. \u201cIn some circles, people think all I\u2019m doing is drinking iced coffee and photographing my outfit. It couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. I\u2019m on calls, I\u2019m doing invoicing, I\u2019m talking to lawyers, I\u2019m signing contracts.\u201d\n\nListing those chores, Atwood believes, brings her closer to her followers. \u201cI get a lot of cool perks and free things, but mostly I\u2019m just like my readers,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m at my desk most of the day, slogging away trying to get through my inbox. I want my to-dos to make me less aspirational and more relatable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe and the other influencers also credit the public to-do lists with helping them get things done. When you\u2019ve told thousands of people that you plan to write a week\u2019s worth of blog posts, you create the expectation for a week\u2019s worth of blog posts. These influencers welcome that extra layer of accountability, though they want to make it clear that productivity isn\u2019t the organizing principle of their lives.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to glorify productivity as my life\u2019s goal, because it\u2019s not \u2014 at least not anymore,\u201d Muenter says. Self-care even has a home on some lists: One influencer I\u2019ve come across checks off her daily water intake in her chore notebook, while another writes a gratitude list every morning. (Yes, her to-do list includes writing another list.)\n\nOf course, while the posters don\u2019t intend to make anyone anxious or unproductive, followers still might wind up feeling anxious and unproductive. But how followers react to these lists may have less to do with the lists themselves, Costello says, and more to do with the mental state they\u2019re in when they tap their way onto Instagram.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSomebody might think \u2018I struggle with looking at my bank balance.\u2019 And seeing that an influencer had that same problem and decided to make it the first thing they do every morning, and that works for them, could be very inspiring,\u201d she says. \u201cSeeing how someone else is spending their day brings up a lot of feelings. It\u2019s really meaty. In therapy, we\u2019d say, \u2018There\u2019s a lot to take apart here.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSo, what should you do if a list makes you feel unaccomplished rather than inspired? When Costello\u2019s clients compare themselves with social media personalities, she reminds them to consider the context of the posts. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful to think of all the content influencers are putting out as being specifically designed to sell you something,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s your job to figure out what they\u2019re trying to sell you, and whether or not you\u2019re interested in buying.\u201d\n\nMore from Lifestyle:\n\nAD", "description": "For their writers, the lists are a way to keep themselves accountable and connect with followers.", "authors": ["Leah Prinzivalli"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UGK89BLu1Ui57wODBRZiQZpYZv0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QIBYCTHXN4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
