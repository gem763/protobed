Whatever the psychological reasons behind this, sticking to one subject has enabled le Carr\u00e9\u2019s large body of work to serve as a guide to the shifting mores of Britain over the six decades of his writing career.\n\nWe can compare and contrast the motives, manner and means of his spies\u2019 acts of betrayal at the height of the Cold War with those of their counterparts in the days of, say, the War on Terror, observing what has changed while bearing in mind Bill Haydon\u2019s observation (in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy) that a nation\u2019s secret services are an \u201cexpression of its subconscious\u201d. Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s new novel is about betrayal in the age of Brexit.", "description": "Even the most devoted fans of John le Carr\u00e9 will admit the truth of some of the recent complaints made against his spy novels by Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6.", "authors": ["Jake Kerridge"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/books/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212590254-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8JWdQZ1J_PyHeSO_SJ-VAuQ7InuxQIQ-797__fFjSOg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
