We don\u2019t want to see any other family live through what we have.\n\n\u201cLosing Becky has been indescribable. We live with guilt every day that we let her go to university, but we would have crushed her dreams if we hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThere has to be checks, balances, follow-ups and communication between students\u2019 home NHS trust and the trust they are with at university. We need to stop failing vulnerable students who can feel isolated and lonely.\u201d\n\nBecky\u2019s issues first emerged in 2010 when she began self-harming \u2013 and she was given private and NHS counselling over the years.\n\nShe started seeing mental health nurse Inderjit Randhawa in her home town Maidstone, Kent, in 2017.\n\nBut she felt anti-depressants she was prescribed weren\u2019t working.\n\nIn July that year, she made her attempted suicide and was temporarily sectioned \u2013 yet it was still not enough to bring forward an in-depth appointment to get a diagnosis and possible medication.\n\nBecky was still on the waiting list when she left home.\n\nHer nurse Randhawa told the inquest her full review appointment had been downgraded from urgent to routine, saying: \u201cShe had a supportive family and seemed excited, if nervous, about going to university.\u201d\n\nWhen Becky went to Goldsmiths she got a GP appointment and saw the mental health team at the South London and Maudsley Trust in mid-October.\n\nBut she was told she still had to wait more than a month for a full review. She killed herself two weeks later. The night before her death, she sent her dad a text saying she loved him, her mum Jeanette, 57, and sister Katy, now 17.\n\nWhen Stephen, 59, was unable to contact Becky the next night he drove to the university and asked staff to open her door.\n\n(Image: Vetta)\n\nShe had left a note about her love for her family.\n\n\u201cThat night will never leave my memory,\u201d says Stephen.\n\nAssistant Southwark Coroner Briony Ballard called on the trusts involved to take action to prevent similar tragedies.\n\nSouth London and Maudsley NHS Trust said it had \u201cidentified areas\u201d to improve information sharing\u201d.\n\nKent and Medway NHS Social Care Partnership Trust said an internal investigation into \u201cwhat should have been better care\u201d for Becky meant \u201cwe are now working much more closely with the student wellbeing and support services with an emphasis on fast tracking students to the mental health help and support they need\u201d.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: A coroner blasted 'many missed opportunities' to save Becky Marshall's life and her family say we must help students who feel so isolated", "authors": ["Grace Macaskill", "Joe Morgan", "Image", "Steve Marshall", "Vetta"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20467929.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Steve-Marshall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
