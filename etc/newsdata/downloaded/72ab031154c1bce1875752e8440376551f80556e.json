The study did not determine why cardiovascular problems were more prevalent among women who experienced menopause before age 50, but it noted that the drop in estrogen levels that accompanies menopause may play a role in this. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for women in the United States, accounting for 1 in 5 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the American Heart Association points out that menopause does not cause cardiovascular disease. Rather, it says, certain risk factors increase at this stage of a woman\u2019s life: Blood pressure tends to go up, as do levels of LDL cholesterol (the \u201cbad\u201d type) and triglycerides. Other life factors that are not heart-healthy \u2014 such as smoking, getting too little exercise and being overweight \u2014 may also contribute. The bottom line for women reaching menopause?
