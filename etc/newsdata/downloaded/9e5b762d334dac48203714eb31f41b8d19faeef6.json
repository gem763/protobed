It is also looking to catch fish living in the twilight zone between 200m and 1,000m deep.\n\nThe UK, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Ukraine, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay are also fishing in Antarctic waters, according to Professor Rogers. They are mainly fishing an extremely valuable species known as toothfish, or Chilean sea bass.\n\nHowever, the economic benefits of fishing come with severe ecological costs. \u200b\n\nA number of studies have shown species dependent on krill such as Ad\u00e9lie and macaroni penguins are in decline. Minke whales and pack-ice seal will lose the sea ice they depend on for foraging and reproduction.\n\nProfessor Rogers said: \u201cResearchers have found a combination of climate change and fishing for krill could lead to extinctions of penguins on some of those Subantarctic islands.\n\n\u201cIf the fishing pressure was removed then those populations would still decline but they wouldn\u2019t disappear. These types of interactions are the ones that are very difficult to understand.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year research found the Ross Ice Shelf \u2013 which is the biggest in the world \u2013 was melting 10 times faster than expected due to solar heating in the Antarctic ocean. The Arctic is currently losing an area of ice larger than Scotland ever year.\n\nProfessor Rogers says protecting polar marine habitats is extremely difficult because we know very little about them. Governments need to make it clear that \u201cthe poles are not for sale\u201d, he says.\n\nOrganisations managing fisheries and marine industries also need to properly quantify how their activities affect wildlife.\n\nEarlier this year the EU and the Arctic Five signed an agreement banning fishing in specific areas of the Arctic until scientists worked out if it could be done sustainably.\n\nProfessor Rogers said: \u201cBritish and French sub-Antarctic territories such as the South Sandwich Islands and St Paul and Amsterdam are still not comprehensively protected. Rectifying this would be a good start.\n\n\u201cDifferent areas of the polar oceans are managed by different nations, and a lack of communication is preventing them from being properly protected. A unified conservation effort could establish vast uninterrupted networks of protected areas.\n\n\u201cThese would make it much easier for species and even entire ecosystems to move polewards as waters warm.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not make things worse by treating the polar oceans as a burgeoning economic resource. Instead, let\u2019s give the life they contain the respect it deserves,\u201d he said.", "description": "Climate breakdown is leaving polar seas exposed to exploitation from industrial\u00a0fishing which could \u201cweaken the will\u201d of people to take urgent climate action, a scientist has warned.\u00a0 Alex Rogers, a visiting professor of conservation at Oxford University, says\u00a0Russian and Norweigian trawlers\u00a0are already benefiting from historically high numbers of cod in Arctic waters as the", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/13/istock-1147301791.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
