She has a compliant media to help her revise history right before our eyes.\n\nThe impeachment fever gripping official Washington and cable newsrooms is not just about removing the president \u2014 it\u2019s about deflecting and discrediting the Justice Department investigations into the shadowy origins of the failed \"Russia collusion\" ghost story.\n\nJACK YOEST: DEMOCRATS WILL PAY FOR GETTING CARRIED AWAY BY SUGAR HIGH OF IMPEACHMENT\n\nDemocrats want us to forget Attorney General William Barr told everyone he would investigate the source of the allegations that launched the Mueller probe and haunted the nation for three years.\n\nThey want us to forget Democrats paid a British spy to dig up dirt on then-candidate Donald J. Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThey want us to forget Democrats also asked Ukrainians to dig up dirt on then-candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThey want us to forget a shady Maltese professor set up a meeting with a Trump campaign aide.\n\nThey want us to forget an Australian diplomat conveniently happened to run into that campaign aide in a London bar, then tipped off the FBI about the aide\u2019s previous meeting with the professor.\n\nThey want us to forget top officials in the FBI, CIA and Justice Department never alerted the Trump campaign to potential threats from Russian agents.\n\nThey want us to forget these same officials launched a counterintelligence investigation of the president, hid it from him and discussed secretly taping their conversations with him.\n\nThey want us to forget Barr said he would get to the bottom of all this and follow the facts wherever they led.\n\nAnd they want us to forget Democratic senators asked Ukraine to help investigate President Trump or risk losing U.S. aid.\n\nHaving forgotten all this, the Democrats now feign outrage that Trump asked leaders of Ukraine, Australia and others to assist our investigators.\n\nHaving forgotten all this, the Democrats and their dutiful stenographers in the corrupt media feign outrage that Barr is traveling abroad to collect facts as he said he would.\n\nThey want us to forget that since his first days in office, the president\u2019s private conversations with foreign leaders have been leaked to the press, an extraordinary breech of security.\n\nHaving forgotten all this, the Democrats pretend to be outraged the president would secure records of his conversations with foreign leaders on a restricted-access computer. They call it a \u201ccover-up,\u201d though the transcript of the conversation in question has been made public.\n\nThey want us to forget the White House, the Justice Department, the State Department and virtually every agency, branch and bureau in this administration has been riddled with leakers, snitches and spies.\n\nThen they claim they don\u2019t know why the attorney general would keep a close hold on his sensitive investigation, and say it must be for some nefarious reason.\n\nThe Democrats would not even attempt to perpetrate such historical revisionism were it not for a compliant media that has ignored, covered up and dismissed the chicanery of a camarilla determined to obstruct and undermine this president.\n\nNow the Democrats hope to recast the attorney general\u2019s investigation into 2016 election skullduggery as foreign interference in the 2020 election and, incidentally, grounds for impeachment.\n\nTo accomplish this sleight of hand, a cabal of partisans including the less-than credible chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., carefully crafted a document alleging wrongdoing by the president and cloaked the accuser in anonymity.\n\nThen, to cement their sordid narrative in the public mind before the facts were known, they leaked an embellished version of the allegations to their collaborators in the media.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nWhen the transcript of the phone call was released, the original accusation of \u201ca promise to a foreign leader\u201d evaporated.\n\nWhen the facts of attorney general\u2019s investigation into illegal foreign interference in the 2016 election come out, the rest of this latest impeachment farce will evaporate as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CURTIS ELLIS", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi doesn\u2019t need an airbrush to change history.
