Then again, you know, there's a lot of parts of the Bible which talk about how life begins with breath,\" Buttiegeg explained during an interview with The Breakfast Club. \"And even so, that's something that we can interpret differently.\"\n\n\"I'm pro-choice,\" host Charlamagne tha God replied.\n\n\"Me too,\" Buttigieg replied. \"But I think no matter where you think about the kind of cosmic question about where live begins, most Americans can get on board with the idea of 'Alright. I might draw the line here. You might draw the line there but most importantly, the person who should be drawling the line is the woman making the decision.'\"\n\n\"Absolutely. And I think that if you're a man who is against abortion you haven't gotten the wrong woman pregnant,\" Charlamagne tha God replied.\n\n\"I mean-\" Buttigieg said with an awkward laugh and shrug.\n\n\"I'm just saying... I've had a few slip ups. A few,\" the radio host explained.\n\nNow, Buttigieg's brother-in-law, Pastor Rhyan Glezman, wants the presidential candidate to repent.\n\n\"I feel a sense of responsibility and stewardship of my faith to stand up and say something, to say, 'No, that's not true,'\" Glezman told the Washington Examiner. \"God places a very high value on all human life. Everyone is created fearfully and wonderfully in the image of God with intrinsic value. That doesn't start at the first breath, it starts when we enter our mother's womb.\"\n\nAccording to Glezman it's \"outrageous\" for Buttigieg to defend abortion up until the point of birth.\n\n\"If we're going to say we're for all people and we love all people, but we don't value human life in the womb, that's being a hypocrite. You're hypocritical if you don't stand up for all life. So that's why I'm speaking out,\" Glezman explained. \"This isn't a little issue, especially when we're talking about life. This is not just a political conversation. We're talking about human life. These are human beings.\"\n\nWhat's interesting, however, is Glezman's take on his brother-in-law. He believes Buttigieg is continually using Christian faith to defend his liberal policies as a way of \"appealing to the evangelical community.\"\n\n\"When I look at every single one of them, their policies, their beliefs, it's very anti-American. It's very anti-life. It's very anti-God,\" Glezman said of the 2020 Democratic field. \"They all have the same rhetoric, and that's the path they're deciding to go down. You see it right down the board. I don't understand why a Democrat can't come out and say, 'I believe life in the womb is valuable.'\"\n\nThe pastor believes Buttigieg is \"a modern-day Pharisee.\"\n\n\"Buttigieg is a person who's making up their own rules and regulations and, basically, if we don't celebrate and endorse their interpretation of Scripture, our religion is fallible. And that's just not true,\" Glezman said.\n\nGlezman hopes the presidential hopeful will repent.\n\n\"...he'd repent from teaching these false claims of Christianity; that he would just have an absolute encounter with God,\" the pastor said. \"Anyone who makes those claims, anyone who's going to weaponize the [Bible] in that way, I would say to anyone that you need to repent. This is leading people astray and it's very, very dangerous.\"", "description": ".09/08/2019 7:39:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/105/ce523739-69ba-4509-9565-cd55af0f6a25.png", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
