Only priests can consecrate the Eucharist, which is a key part of Catholic Mass.\n\nEven promoters of the idea, however, are not calling for the centuries-old custom of priestly celibacy to be scrapped entirely.\n\nAnd the ultra-conservative wing of the Catholic Church -- particularly in Europe and North America -- have refused to counter the idea, warning that making exceptions could pave the way to the abolition of celibacy globally.Many at the synod are also hoping for an official recognition by the Church of the key role played by lay women in the evangelisation of indigenous people by creating formal specific roles for them, termed \"ministries\".\n\nThere are some who would even like them to be allowed to become deacons, a function currently reserved for lay men.\n\nMale deacons, who can be single or married, are able to baptise, witness marriages, perform funerals and preach homilies.\n\nTwo thirds of the indigenous communities without priests are guided by women.\n\nBrazilian Bishop Evaristo Pascoal Spengler said Friday he was very optimistic about a vote in favour of female deacons, pointing out there were deaconesses in the early Church.\n\nFellow Brazilian Archbishop Alberto Taveira Correa said the proposals on married priests or ministries for women would be submitted \"for the discernment of the pope, who will be able to define the possible steps to be taken\".\n\nThe last of the three key issues concerns the formal recognition of the richness of indigenous peoples' culture and liturgy with the creation of an Amazonian rite, which would incorporate their symbols and gestures while maintaining the essence of the Eucharist.", "description": "Catholic bishops gathered at a special Vatican assembly will vote Saturday on whether to recommend Pope Francis to open the priesthood to married men or create female deacons, issues that are taboo for traditionalists.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7269/66c419d1f0de4d829d5d2c561453d6b3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
