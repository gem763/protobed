Kamenar said he was \u201cpuzzled\u201d as to why prosecutors wanted Miller as a government witness \u2014 he said earlier this year that he did not think Miller would be called \u2014 but confirmed that Miller plans to comply.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe result is that one of Stone\u2019s closest aides will be testifying about him at his trial in November for lying to Congress and the FBI about his dealings with WikiLeaks during the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMiller worked with Stone for over a decade, managing his schedule and travel. Miller accompanied Stone to the Republican National Convention in 2016, meaning he might have insight into Stone\u2019s activity around this time.\n\nThe subpoena offers further evidence that the government considers Miller a key part of its prosecution strategy and marks just the latest legal setback for Stone. U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson in July banned the one-time Trump political adviser from social media after ruling that he ran afoul of a court-imposed gag order.\n\nProsecutors have long had Miller on their radar and subpoenaed him in 2018 to testify before Mueller\u2019s grand jury. Miller vigorously fought the move, arguing that Mueller\u2019s appointment was invalid because his level of authority should have required Senate confirmation. He also contended that the deputy attorney general did not have the power to appoint Mueller, even though then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the matter.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The move raised some eyebrows, since grand juries are not supposed to be used to investigate a criminal case that\u2019s already been filed. But grand juries can be used to add new charges or to charge new defendants.\n\nU.S. District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell appeared satisfied during a hearing earlier this summer with prosecutors\u2019 explanations of why they still needed Miller to testify before the grand jury, and ordered him to appear in early June. Miller then abandoned his fight, as his only remaining option was to appeal to the Supreme Court, and turned over all of his text messages with Stone from October 2016 to March 2017, as well as the written agenda for Stone while he was at the Republican National Convention in 2016.\n\nAnother government witness at Stone\u2019s trial will be Randy Credico, a colorful New York radio host and Stone acquaintance who was subpoenaed by the Washington, D.C., U.S. attorney\u2019s office on April 18. That subpoena, obtained by POLITICO, orders Credico to appear in court the day the trial opens.\n\nCredico is expected to shed light not only on Stone\u2019s efforts to connect with WikiLeaks during the 2016 election as he sought Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, but also on Stone\u2019s alleged attempts to intimidate Credico into parroting his version of events.", "description": "Andrew Miller, whom Roger Stone has described as his \"wingman,\" will appear at Stone's November trial for lying to Congress and the FBI.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/87/b4/8c05bff64ae8b6419d77879e9f92/190904-andrew-miller-ap-773.jpg"}
