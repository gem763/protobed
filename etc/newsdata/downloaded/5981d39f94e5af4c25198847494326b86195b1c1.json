And even now, I don\u2019t regret it at all.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Konger said he had been distracted by the sometimes-violent unrest in his home city over the past four months.\n\n\u201cQuite a number of large-scale protests overlapped the competition time,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, I couldn\u2019t focus on the competition.\u201d\n\nThe makers of Hearthstone, Blizzard Entertainment, wrote in a statement Ng had broken their rules and said he will not receive any prize money \u2014 US$10,000 according to Ng \u2014 and will be banned from Hearthstone eSports for a year.\n\nThose rules say players must not engage in acts that bring themselves into \u201cpublic disrepute\u201d, offend anybody or damage the developer\u2019s image.\n\nThe video game industry last year generated more than $135 billion globally \u2014 $43.4 billion of that in the United States alone.\n\nNg said his removal from the competition was \u201ca pity\u201d after spending four years in eSports.\n\n\u201cI sacrificed time hanging out with my friends and studying because of this competition. Even though it seemed that I had wasted four years of time, I have something more important in my heart \u2014 if we lose the movement, Hong Kong will end forever.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, a small stake of Activision Blizzard \u2014 the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment \u2014 is owned by the Chinese holding company Tencent and Ng believes the games developer could be bowing to Beijing\u2019s world view by silencing him.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect my comments would make a huge impact,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just expressing myself and why should I be afraid of this kind of \u2018white terror\u2019? This is my freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be scared. I hope my act can inspire other gamers like me, to continue to support the movement in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe gamer drew support from the gaming community, some of whom wrote on the Reddit-like forum LIHKG.\n\n\u201cI really can\u2019t think of any reason why the developers in eSports would offend youngsters. Good luck to them,\u201d wrote one user in Cantonese.\n\nAnother wrote: \u201cI had been supporting the Blizzard Entertainment for nearly 20 years. I bought most of its games. I\u2019m uninstalling all its games. I will not support Blizzard anymore.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 A top online gamer from Hong Kong who was expelled from an international eSports tournament after showing support for the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/f8fd77_video-game-industry-year-generated-135-billion-globally-no-regrets-hong-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
