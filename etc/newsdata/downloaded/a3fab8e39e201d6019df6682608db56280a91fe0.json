(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Latest on wildfires in California (all times local):\n\n8:15 a.m.\n\nContainment is inching up on a smoky Los Angeles wildfire that damaged or destroyed more than 30 structures, as crews take advantage of calmer winds and cooler temperatures.\n\nOfficials say the blaze in the San Fernando Valley hasn't grown significantly since Friday. It's 19% contained Saturday morning.\n\nThousands of people remain under evacuation orders. Authorities warn there's still potential for flare-ups even as weather conditions improve.\n\nAir quality is poor as smoke from the fire settles over much of greater Los Angeles.\n\nTo the east, a blaze that ripped through a Riverside County mobile home park, destroying dozens of residences, is 25% contained with minimal growth.\n\nIn Northern California, the lights are back on for 98% of customers who lost power when Pacific Gas & Electric switched it off in an effort to prevent wildfires.\n\n___\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nSanta Ana winds that drove fires through two Southern California areas have died down but flames that destroyed dozens of homes continue to rage.\n\nA blaze in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles was only 13% contained Saturday after destroying 13 buildings. One man who had tried to fight the blaze died of a heart attack.\n\nThe fast-moving fire is keeping tens of thousands of people from returning to their homes until officials are convinced it's safe.\n\nThe fire broke out Thursday, just hours after flaming garbage in a trash truck sparked another wind-whipped blaze that ravaged a mobile park in Calimesa, east of Los Angeles.\n\nSeveral residents of the park were unaccounted for and the family of an 89-year-old woman says they fear she died when her home burned.", "description": "Containment is inching up on a smoky Los Angeles wildfire that damaged or destroyed more than 30 structures, as crews take advantage of calmer winds and cooler temperatures.
