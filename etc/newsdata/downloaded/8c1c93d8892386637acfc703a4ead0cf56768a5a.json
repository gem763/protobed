For the fiscal year of 2009-2010, the Harper government ran a deficit of $56.4 billion. Before they were done, the Conservatives ran six years of annual deficits, totalling $157.8 billion.\n\nStephen Harper abandoned his deficit pledge in the face of a global recession. His successors are finding it easier to put off deficit elimination to a later date. (Jose Luis Magana/Associated Press)\n\nStill, it was considered heresy when Justin Trudeau announced in 2015 that a Liberal government would run three years of deficits to boost a sluggish economy. One newspaper described the plan as \"political suicide.\" Shortly thereafter, Trudeau's Liberals won a majority.\n\nOnce in office, the Trudeau government pushed things further \u2014 first because of economic circumstances, then because of its own choices and priorities \u2014 resulting in deficits of $19 billion, $19 billion, $14 billion and $19.8 billion.\n\nTax cuts vs. spending hikes\n\nHarper's deficits could be traced to his decisions to cut taxes \u2014 the GST in particular. Trudeau's deficits had more to do with new spending on federal programs.\n\nWhile running for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2017, Andrew Scheer vowed to balance the budget within two years of forming government. But as the 2019 general election neared \u2014 and with budget cuts by Doug Ford's provincial government angering voters in Ontario \u2014 Scheer lost some of his enthusiasm for swift deficit elimination. In May, he announced that a Conservative government would instead take five years to balance the budget.\n\nFederal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer softened his stance on deficits after winning the party leadership. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe Liberal platform released on Sunday nudges the goalposts again. With promised new spending, a re-elected Liberal government would run larger deficits, starting at $27.4 billion in the first year and declining to $21 billion in the fourth.\n\nThe Conservative response was notable for what it lacked. Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre's primary argument was not that the deficits were themselves immoral or fundamentally unsound. Rather, he claimed the deficits inevitably would lead a Liberal government to increase taxes \u2014 tax hikes the Conservatives claim Trudeau is concealing now.\n\nThat attack might resonate more if the Harper government's deficits had triggered the same consequences.\n\nThe difference between 1995 and now\n\nEconomists like Kevin Milligan argue that the current deficit is not a matter for great concern \u2014 that government debt is not like household debt, borrowing rates are low, the situation in 2019 is not what it was in 1995 and recent deficits have been relatively modest.\n\nThe debt-to-GDP ratio \u2014 the debt as measured against the entirety of the national economy \u2014 was 31.5 per cent in 2014-2015. The Liberals now project that, even after eight years of deficits, it will be 30.2 per cent of GDP in 2023-2024. (For the sake of comparison, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 66.8 per cent in 1996, when Jean Chr\u00e9tien and Paul Martin were compelled to cut spending.)\n\nBut the bottom line still resonates in political news coverage and partisan debate. It's an easy way to measure a budget or a platform, something that can be quickly understood \u2014 unlike the relative value of the actual spending and tax commitments that a government or party makes. \"Is the budget balanced?\" is a much easier question to answer than, say, \"How much should the government be spending to help families?\"\n\nSpending into a deficit can be easily described as reckless. But it's not clear the public is much more concerned than the average economist.\n\nOther priorities\n\nJust 13 per cent of respondents to an Ipsos Reid survey earlier this month said government debt was among their three most important election issues. An Angus Reid Institute poll found only three per cent of uncommitted voters considered it their top issue. In both polls, issues like climate change, the cost of living and health care rated much higher.\n\nThat combination of economic and public sentiment may have given Trudeau room to promise more. But it's also not clear how far the public's patience with red ink might last.\n\nThe most expensive item in the Liberal platform is the promise to raise the personal income tax deduction, but its new commitments also include a boost to the Canada Child Benefit for families with children under a year old, new breaks for post-secondary students, a boost to Old Age Security and new spending to mitigate climate change. In all, the Liberals are effectively offering to push slightly harder in the direction they've set out over the last four years.\n\nScheer's Conservatives are still committed to a greater degree of frugality. That, along with a series of promised tax cuts, should compel them to present a different picture of what a federal government would do when they table their complete platform \u2014 to present their own approach as a stark contrast with what the Liberals have planned.\n\nIn 2011, Harper's Conservatives promised $1.6 billion in new spending, while Michael Ignatieff's Liberals countered with a platform that included $5.5 billion in new initiatives, all of it covered by corresponding tax increases or spending cuts.\n\nIn 2019, instead of arguing within a box created by competing desires to both balance the budget and avoid broad-based tax increases, the platforms of the two main federal parties could be upwards of $20 billion apart.\n\nThat is not a small amount of money.\n\nIf the orthodoxy of the balanced budget has weakened, it has left room for a clearer choice.", "description": "There was a time, not too long ago, when any federal party leader promising back-to-back deficits could expect scorn and mockery.
