To determine this, it used a hypothetical couple with two kids and $150,000 in income a year plus $10,000 in dividend income, and then looked at their income, property and sales tax burden.\n\nIllinois took the No. 1 spot on the list, thanks in large part to their very high property taxes. That was followed by Connecticut and New York, both of which have pretty high income taxes.\n\nThe 10 least tax-friendly states:\n\n1. Illinois\n\n2. Connecticut\n\n3. New York\n\n4. Wisconsin\n\n5. New Jersey\n\n6. Nebraska\n\n7. Pennsylvania\n\n8. Ohio\n\n9. Iowa\n\n10. Kansas\n\nMeanwhile, the most tax-friendly states (in order) were Wyoming, Nevada and Tennessee. The first two don\u2019t have income tax; Tennessee has income tax but it only applies to interest and dividends and doesn\u2019t apply to salaries and wages.\n\nThe 10 most tax-friendly states:\n\n1. Wyoming\n\n2. Nevada\n\n3. Tennessee\n\n4. Florida\n\n5. Alaska\n\n6. Washington\n\n7. South Dakota\n\n8. North Dakota\n\n9. Arizona\n\n10. New Hampshire\n\nOne seeming surprise? California, which many think of as a high-tax state, didn\u2019t crack the top 10 least-friendly tax states. (Of course, it\u2019s important to point out that this Kiplinger\u2019s ranking would look different if the hypothetical family and its income and dividends were different.)\n\n\n\nRocky Mengle, the tax editor for Kiplinger\u2019s, tells MarketWatch that\u2019s because many people \u201cwhen they talk about California tax, they focus on the 13.3% rate, which is the top rate \u2014 but that is for people making more than $1 million.\u201d For many others, the rate is much lower, he says, adding that \u201cCalifornia has a fairly progressive income tax with nine brackets.\u201d\n\nMengle adds that these kinds of analyses are often very useful to people looking to relocate, like in retirement. If that\u2019s the case, he says, retirees should also \u201cpay attention to what type of income they are going to be relying on in their golden years.\u201d That\u2019s because states tax income, Social Security, money from an IRA or 401(k), rental property income and more differently.\n\nFor example, Social Security income is not taxed in most states, but 13 states do tax it. These include Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia. And even then, they don\u2019t all tax it the same.\n\nRetirees may also want to consider the inheritance and estate tax in the spot they want to move. Right now, 13 states and Washington, D.C. have an estate tax and six have an inheritance tax.
