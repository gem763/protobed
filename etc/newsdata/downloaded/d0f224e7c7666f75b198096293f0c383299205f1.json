Gross short exposure remains near a 4-month high, although last week\u2019s increase of bearishness was a function of both longs and shorts closing out. Yet, whilst positioning doesn\u2019t scream a sentiment extreme, rallied nearly 1% between Tuesday\u2019s close (when the report was compiled) and Friday\u2019s high on progress with US-China trade talks. So, is the low in? Perhaps, but I\u2019m not currently convinced from this alone. There\u2019s still a long way to go on trade talks and traders remains net-short on the Euro. So until we see a material pick-up with gross longs and closure of shorts, it\u2019s probably better to assume the trend remains bearish.\n\nLarge Speculative Positioning\n\n: Over the past three weeks we\u2019ve seen gross longs increase and gross shorts decreased; albeit by a small amount but it has allowed net-short exposure to fall to a 3-month low. Given the 4% rally on cable over Thursday and Friday on Brexit developments, we\u2019d expect net-short exposure to fall notably, assuming traders still think there\u2019s chance of a deal before 31st of October. And looking at the cycles of net-short exposure, it\u2019s plausible that the low was in around mid-August.\n\nAs of Tuesday 8th October:\n\nTraders reduced net-long exposure to a 4-month low.\n\nBullish positioning on Palladium was at its highest level in 8-months.\n\nNet-short exposure to was at its most bearish level in 8-weeks.\n\nOnly minor adjustments to gold positioning sees net-long exposure remain stubbornly high.\n\nWTI Managed Funds Positioning\n\nWTI: Net-long exposure declined for a fourth consecutive week, taking bullish exposure for large speculators to their least bullish in 4-months. However, managed funds (pictured above) saw bullish net-long exposure fall to a 9-month low. Gross shorts are at their most bearish level since January, adding +36.9k contracts last week alone (or over +75k over the past three weeks) so some funds may have been squeezed following the missile attack on an Iranian oil tanker on Friday. Yet with volatility remaining relatively low following the attack, some funds may see the bounce as a reason to add to shorts unless geopolitical tensions rise, or we see another supply shock to make prices truly rally.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by City Index (Matt Simpson) covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, Copper Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
