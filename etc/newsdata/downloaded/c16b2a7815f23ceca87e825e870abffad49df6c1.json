Oh, do behave, readers \u2013 it\u2019s his wedding ring: black, ceramic, studded with a diamond and, as he gleefully points out, rather S&M-looking.\n\nHe wed his longtime partner, Ian Mackley, in 2016, although he is not here today to talk about that. The last time he did, telling Attitude magazine that he wasn\u2019t sure if he liked married life, he got into heaps of trouble. \u201cYes, I did! So now my mind is always going: \u2018Don\u2019t say anything too harsh!\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cAll I can say, really, is that I\u2019m highly amused by being married.\u201d\n\nBut there aren\u2019t many subjects that are off-limits for Clary. He rose to fame in the 80s as an outrageously camp comic decked out in garish PVC who shocked audiences with his innuendo-packed gags about gay sex. He sent his career into a tailspin at the 1993 British Comedy awards by telling the audience: \u201cI\u2019ve just been fisting Norman Lamont.\u201d (The then chancellor was in the audience with his wife, Rosemary, and the tabloids had a field day.) And Clary\u2019s 2005 autobiography, A Young Man\u2019s Passage, could teach most millennials a thing or two about the art of oversharing, what with its inclusion of embarrassing ailments and graphic ejaculation scenes.\n\nAt 60 years of age, Clary is still touring \u2013 his Born to Mince tour has just been extended \u2013 although he says it may be his last time around the circuit. \u201cAlthough I do always say that, rather lamely,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut can you go on doing buggery jokes into your 70s and 80s? I don\u2019t want to be one of those comedians who plays to ever-dwindling audiences. I met Danny La Rue in Australia once and he was doing a tour of care homes. I did think: \u2018Fuck me, does it come to that in the end?\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Clary in 1989 on his TV show Trick or Treat. Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nOf course, Clary doesn\u2019t trade so much in shock these days. There\u2019s an element of the unknown to his shows, thanks to his fondness for audience interaction \u2013 \u201cthey might be drunk, they might be mad\u201d \u2013 but in general his shows have become cosy, affectionate affairs, full of people who have been coming to see him for decades; some of whom now bring their grownup kids along. This time, he has included a section called \u201cheterosexual aversion therapy\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s just an excuse to get four straight men on stage and attach wires to their genitals. It\u2019s a bit of nonsense, really.\u201d But it\u2019s nonsense with a political edge if you\u2019re looking for it.\n\nWhen Clary first started out in comedy, he used to ditch any jokes that could potentially be deemed to have a political element: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be preachy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suit camp, really. Camp needs to be trivial by its very nature.\u201d And yet simply by being who he was \u2013 an overtly effeminate male on mainstream TV, talking about \u201cshiny helmets\u201d and \u201cjuicy saveloys\u201d, he was hugely political. His first reviews prompted plenty of \u201cGet This Poof Off Our Screens!\u201d headlines: \u201cThings the Daily Mail wouldn\u2019t even print now,\u201d he notes. How did that feel at the time? \u201cOh, I loved it! It\u2019s just the reaction I would have wanted from them.\u201d\n\nBy that time, Clary had had plenty of practice when it came to outraging straight society. Raised in the middle-class suburb of Teddington in south-west London, he surprised his family by winning a scholarship at St Benedict\u2019s, a Catholic private school in nearby Ealing. It was there he endured beatings from priests (something that wiped out his young religious fervour) and much bullying from peers for his effeminate mannerisms \u2013 something he gleefully played up to with his best (and only) friend, Nicholas Reader.\n\n\u201cWe found a way to turn it all into a performance,\u201d he says. \u201cJust mincing around, really, to escape from it into an imaginary world. Because we thought, well, this may be where we\u2019re stuck now, but we will do something with our lives.\u201d\n\nTheir friendship endured throughout Clary\u2019s fame, and so it is upsetting to hear that Reader died in June, especially as Clary\u2019s eyes well up a little when mentioning him. He says he has a ritual before he goes on stage each night: a little conversation with friends who are no longer here. \u201cNow Nick has been added, and Auntie Tess, too,\u201d he says. \u201cI noticed on the last tour that I\u2019d started to think: \u2018Well, I wonder who will be in today?\u2019 And then you see all these little faces leering down at you.\u201d\n\nClary says he has been thinking about Reader\u2019s influence on him a lot since he died: how they helped each other get through school, and how Reader probably shaped his comedy career. \u201cBecause we did escape through comedy, the usefulness of laughing at things that aren\u2019t actually nice. I was very shy [before they met] and quite effeminate, but the whole Quentin Crisp thing we adopted when we were together; that came from Nick, really.\u201d\n\nAfter school, Clary worked the cabaret circuit (along with a stint as a singing telegram), noticing a gap in the market for male glamour and escapism, and, after getting his TV break on Saturday Live in 1987, his fame swiftly soared. At about the same time, he became a regular at the \u201csordid little clubs\u201d in Soho, although it\u2019s a time he recalls with a sadness: \u201cBecause people kept disappearing.\u201d During the Aids crisis, Clary says the attitude within the gay community was basically: \u201c\u2018Everything\u2019s fucked, so we may as well party.\u2019 And so you would carry on \u2013 you\u2019d go out and be gayer than ever, really.\u201d\n\nHis parents were unaware of how reckless he was being, and so, he says, was he. \u201cBecause, compared with everyone else, I wasn\u2019t being reckless. It was just normal. And today, people are still just as reckless. I wasn\u2019t taking crystal meth and going to sex parties for the entire weekend.\u201d\n\nAlthough he recalls it with some embarrassment, he thinks a nasty case of anal warts probably saved him from contracting HIV. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things you realise in retrospect, where you think \u2013 gosh, maybe there is a God after all?\u201d he laughs. \u201cBecause I was very keen on it \u2026 and then I got the warts, and I was so mortified I wouldn\u2019t let anyone investigate that orifice for quite some time.\u201d\n\nFate was less kind to others, including Clary\u2019s boyfriend, Christopher, who died in 1991. In his autobiography, Clary writes beautifully \u2013 and brutally \u2013 about caring for him in his final days: cleaning up the fleshy lumps his lover was hacking up; taking him on ill-advised holidays in the sun. When he died, Clary put a circle of flowers around his face and asked the hospital to leave him lying in state for three hours: \u201cI wanted three days, but I knew there was a queue for that room,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe still has the notes Christopher wrote to him from hospital, and came across them recently: \u201cIt was upsetting,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause you\u2019re back in that moment, in the hospital. It\u2019s quite nice to remember happier times generally when I think of him.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Clary in 1989. Photograph: Darryn Lyons/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nClary was still grieving, taking on far too much work, and was pumped full of Valium when he delivered his infamous Normal Lamont gag. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good joke, and I stand by it,\u201d he says now, slightly miffed that people remember the fisting part and not the punchline: \u201cTalk about a red box\u201d was largely drowned out by uproarious laughter. He didn\u2019t enjoy the backlash \u2013 \u201cyou become a comedian because you want to be popular\u201d \u2013 but thinks, as with the warts, it may have been another unlikely case of divine intervention. \u201cI like to think he made me say something outrageous in order to clear my diary and give me some time off. Television was never my forte. It\u2019s probably just as well that I stayed out of it.\u201d\n\nIn some ways you can view Clary \u2013 who faced calls that he should be banned from television \u2013 as an early victim of \u201ccancel culture\u201d, although it was the right wing that Clary had offended: \u201cAnd I always felt that if you\u2019d outraged the Daily Mail then it was job done, really.\u201d So what does he think about today\u2019s comedy climate, where offending liberal sensibilities can cause you to be persona non grata?\n\n\u201cIf you start worrying about that, then it\u2019s all over,\u201d he says. \u201cYou end up with very safe, insincere comedy. That\u2019s where alternative comedy started \u2013 as a reaction to that.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s a new prudishness going on that is stifling comedy \u2013 concepts such as LGBT venues being safe spaces, or comedians thinking long and hard about who their targets should be, are things he\u2019s fully onboard with: \u201cI quite understand things like safe spaces and refusing to engage because life\u2019s too short. I get that.\u201d\n\nWould he have appreciated safe-space venues in the 80s? \u201cWell, no,\u201d he laughs. \u201cPeople think of that time as the dark ages. It wasn\u2019t, but it was a bit grim. But I didn\u2019t really play the gay circuit \u2013 I needed heterosexuals to pick on.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve got these mannerisms, this voice and all the things that could be a problem in life. So I decided to emphasise them\n\nDoes he ever worry about jokes that could be deemed to stereotype gay people? \u201cNo, because I don\u2019t ever think of myself as a stereotype. I have the right to be a camp, effeminate homosexual.\u201d He remembers going on highly politicised Pride marches in the 1980s. \u201cBack when it was all chants and whistles. We would be quite cross, as opposed to the commercial celebration thing it is now, which is also great.\u201d\n\nHe attended Pride this year, although it was \u2013 to paraphrase Withnail \u2013 by mistake (he was going elsewhere, but got caught up in things). He found himself shocked by just how debauched it all was. \u201cIt was a bit scary, the number of people and the \u2026\u201d he adopts a reaching-for-the-smelling-salts voice \u2013 \u201clevels of intoxication. I was worried for people \u2013 how are you going to get home? Where will you go to the toilet? I came over all paternal, much to my surprise.\u201d\n\nClary says the recent embracing of sexual fluidity and non-binary identities is a great evolvement: \u201cWhy not? We are all on sliding scales and there\u2019s no reason why that shouldn\u2019t move around. I know people get very worked up about it, but speak to teenagers and they\u2019re perfectly accepting of it all. People come out really young now; they can change their minds, and no one screams. It\u2019s a very good omen for the future.\u201d Indeed, even this self-styled \u201crenowned homosexual\u201d thinks such labels would have been helpful to him during his own sexual awakening. He embarked on a heterosexual affair while he was a student at Goldsmiths, University of London. \u201cI was terribly good at heterosexual sex, I quite mastered it,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut obviously emotionally, and in other ways, it wasn\u2019t what I needed.\u201d\n\nClary seems to enjoy his current life half out of the spotlight more than he did his peak fame years. Along with his tour, he has the \u201cunexpected joy in my life\u201d that is writing children\u2019s fiction \u2013 earlier this year, the fifth of his The Bolds series was published. The books are based on a story about the neighbours Clary made up himself as an eight-year-old boy \u2013 about a family of hyenas who have disguised themselves as humans and live in Teddington.\n\n\u201cI just regress to being a child when I write them,\u201d he says. Clary has just written a stage version, too, and the experience is so rewarding that it has put him off the idea of writing the next volume of his autobiography. (The first one only went up to 1993.) \u201cI\u2019m contemplating whether I can really face that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to write a children\u2019s book \u2013 25,000 words, thank you, goodbye. You don\u2019t have to bare your soul.\u201d\n\nSo what, after several decades of fame, does Clary think his legacy is? \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I think the way he brought the gay experience into people\u2019s living rooms, at a time when it was seen as something unpalatable by much of the press and public, must count for something. \u201cDemystifying gay sex \u2026 yes, I\u2019ll take that,\u201d he muses. \u201cSpecifically anal intercourse, because people just cannot cope with that, in all sorts of cultures.\u201d He smiles: \u201cIt\u2019s a very strange legacy, isn\u2019t it? But I did design it. I\u2019ve got these mannerisms and this voice and all the things that could be a problem in life. So I decided to emphasise them all the more. That\u2019s what comedy can do,\u201d he concludes. \u201cYou can just turn things the other way around and suddenly they\u2019re an asset.\u201d\n\nThe extension of Julian Clary\u2019s Born to Mince tour runs from 25 April-23 May 2020.
