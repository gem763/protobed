She is also alleging that The Irishman actor made unwanted physical contact and was verbally abusive to her.\n\nGraham Chase Robinson, who filed the lawsuit in a New York federal court, worked for De Niro\u2019s Canal Productions as vice president of production and finance. De Niro sued her in August for $6 million, alleging that she misused corporate credit cards and engaged in Netflix bingewatching while on the job.\n\nRobinson is now firing back, seeking at least $12 million in damages. In the complaint, she alleges that De Niro engaged in vulgar rants against her and at least one other female business partner. She claims De Niro called her a \u201cbitch\u201d and a \u201cbrat\u201d while calling another woman a \u201ccunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMs. Robinson\u2019s position became increasingly intolerable, and over the years she announced her intent to resign multiple times,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cDe Niro responded with both a carrot and a stick \u2013 he made promises to induce to her stay and threatened repercussions if she left.\u201d\n\nRobinson claims that De Niro\u2019s initial lawsuit contains falsehoods and mischaracterizations.\n\n\u201cThe results have been devasting to Ms. Robinson. Her reputation and her career have been destroyed,\u201d the suit states.\n\nRobinson claims that De Niro made unwanted physical contact when he would direct her to scratch his back, button his shirts, fix his collars, tie his ties, and prod him awake when he was in bed.\n\n\u201cDe Niro also stood idly by while his friend slapped Ms. Robinson on her buttocks,\u201d the complaint says.\n\nRobinson slams the actor for clinging to outdated views of gender in the workplace: \u201cHe does not accept the idea that men should treat women as equals. He does not care that gender discrimination in the workplace violates the law. Ms. Robinson is a casualty of this attitude.\u201d\n\nDe Niro has spent the last few weeks promoting Netflix\u2019s The Irishman, which opens in select theaters Nov. 1 before becoming available to stream later that month.\n\nDuring the press tour, the actor has repeatedly ranted against President Donald Trump. \u201cHe has no morals. No ethics. If people don\u2019t wake up and he gets reelected, it\u2019s going to be very, very bad,\u201d the actor told Variety.", "description": "Actor Robert De Niro is being sued by a former employee who claims \u00a0that the Hollywood star engaged in gender discrimination, harassment, and workplace retaliation.
