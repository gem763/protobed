If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nAmericans are cutting the cord left and right, and the trend even extends to their vacuums. Cordless vacuum cleaners give you the freedom to track down messes in your home, regardless of how close they are to an outlet.\n\nWe\u2019ve been testing cordless vacuums for years in our labs, and our favorite is the Dyson V11 Torque Drive. But there are still a number of cordless models on the market that help with floor cleaning. From modern Dysons to steadfast Oreks, these are the best cordless vacuums we tested, ranked in order.\n\n1. Dyson V11 Torque Drive\n\nOur pick for best overall cordless stick vacuum\u2014the Dyson V11 Torque Drive. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nThe Dyson V11 Torque Drive is a no-compromise cordless vacuum. It has powerful cleaning, great battery life, and features you won\u2019t find anywhere else. The V11 has two major features that set it apart from all other cordless vacuums: an LCD screen on the back and automatic suction adjustment.\n\nThe screen lets you know, down to the second, how much battery life you have left. This feature ensures you\u2019ll never be caught short while vacuuming between the cushions. The self-adjusting suction is a little more subtle. When you\u2019re cleaning, the V11 lowers or increases the amount of suction power based on the type of surface you\u2019re cleaning. This increases battery life and helps keep this Dyson from damaging your floors.\n\nShiny new toys aside, the V11 also aces the basics. Our testing showed that this Dyson picked up 95% of the dirt we laid out for it. The large debris tests also impressed us: A lot of vacuums just plows crumbs from one side of the room to the other, whereas the V11 has specialized gaps in its brush head to ensure pickup.\n\nGet the Dyson V11 Torque Drive on Amazon for $599\n\n2. Dyson V10 Absolute\n\nDyson Cyclone V10 Absolute (Photo: Dyson)\n\nWhen we first heard about the Dyson V10 Absolute, the details made us skeptical. Dyson announced that it would stop developing new corded vacuums because of how confident the R&D team was in the V10.\n\nHowever, after spending time with the V10, we found the Absolute moniker to be apt, since the V10 comes with absolutely everything: a powered brush head that's designed for hardwood floors, a motorized mini brush for cleaning upholstery, a soft brush for hardwood, a combination upholstery/bare floor tool, a crevice tool, a drive cleaner head, and a soft dusting brush for computers and delicate items. They all attach to a 5.6-pound wall-mountable package, making it one of the lightest cordless vacuums on the market.\n\nThe V10 puts all these tools to good use. In our testing lab, it picked up 89% of the dirt we left out for it. Even more surprising, the V10 also dominated the battery power tests. On the low setting, it can run for 60 minutes, perfect for day-to-day maintenance. For intense cleaning jobs, you can run the Absolute for 9 minutes on the highest setting.\n\nGet the Dyson V10 Absolute on Amazon for $491.49\n\n3. LG Cordzero A9 Ultimate\n\nLG Cordzero A9 Ultimate (Photo: LG)\n\nLG Cordzero A9 Ultimate epitomizes an easy-to-use cordless vacuum. Its dock can be set up to be free-standing, allowing you to charge anywhere without having to drill holes in the wall. This standing dock also has space for the alternate cleaning head and several attachments. When in use, the A9 comes with two removable batteries, giving you 16 minutes of cleaning time on the highest setting.\n\nWe cleaned carpets and bare floors with the A9. This cordless impressed us with its powerful suction, picking up 72.5% of the testing dirt we laid out for it and all of the food debris. Also during cleaning, we enjoyed using the telescopic wand, adjusting the reach up to 45 inches from handle to tip.\n\nOverall, we think the A9 is a strong competitor to Dyson's top performers. The A9 is easier to store and has more battery life, but lacks the raw power of the V11 or V10.\n\nGet the LG Cordzero A9 Ultimate on Amazon for $699.99\n\n4. Dyson V8 Absolute\n\nDyson V8 Absolute (Photo: Reviewed / Kyle Looney)\n\nThe Dyson V8 Absolute is near the pinnacle of cordless vacuum technology. It's one heck of a vacuum.\n\nThe V8 almost overwhelms with the number of attachments: a powered brush head that's designed for hardwood floors, a motorized upholstery brush, a soft brush for hardwood, a combination upholstery/bare floor tool, a crevice tool, and a soft dusting brush. As a hallmark of Dyson design, the handheld unit only weighs 5.6 pounds.\n\nThe brush head is made from carbon fiber and nylon. It's softer than a puppy\u2014and infinitely more gentle on floors and better at picking up dirt. In our labs, the V8 picked up 88 percent of the dirt we put down for our tests.\n\nOn the low setting, the battery lasted an amazing 40 minutes. (The max suction setting will drain the battery in 7 minutes, though.) When you're done, its dustbin empties out dirt with the pull of a single lever on top of the machine.\n\nIf want the V10's sleek design for less, the V8 is a viable option. However, the V8 still costs twice as much as most of the vacuums on our list. For everyone else, our Best Value pick works almost as well, but costs a quarter as much.\n\nGet the Dyson V8 Absolute at Home Depot for $499\n\n5. Dyson V6\n\nDyson V6 (Photo: Dyson)\n\nFormerly Dyson's cordless flagship until the V8 replaced it, the Dyson V6 is the cordless vacuum to buy if even your smallest messes require significant cleaning. It's as powerful as the V8, but has a weaker battery life (20 minutes on low compared to the V8's 40 minutes) and lack of a bare floors attachment.\n\nHowever, the V6 does not lack for customizing options. It can be reconfigured to better clean your car, the stairs, the ceiling, the floor, and your carpets. On paper, that's all very well and good, but we found it cumbersome in practice because there's no place for the extra parts to go when they're not in use.\n\nGet the Dyson V6 at Home Depot for $249\n\n6. Tineco Pure One S12\n\nTineco Pure One S12 (Photo: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan)\n\nThe Tineco Pure One S12 is one of the most unique cordless vacuums we've ever tested. It has a user interface that lets you know how much battery life you have left, the amount of suction, and how clean your floor is.\n\nWhile testing, we found that the S12 was pretty good at estimating how much dirt was on our carpet. It declared a clean surface when 80% of the testing dirt was suctioned up. Overall, the cleaning performance lagged behind other cordless vacuums in the Pure One's price range, but not so much so that it's a deal breaker.\n\nIf you want the coolest tech in your home, the Tineco Pure One S12 is a solid choice.\n\nGet the Tineco Pure One S12 on Amazon for $570\n\n7. Tineco A10 Hero\u2014the best value\n\nOur pick for best value cordless stick vacuum\u2014the Tineco A10 Hero. (Photo: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan)\n\nThe Tineco A10 Hero, our best value choice for cordless stick vacuums, comes from the same people that brought us the Ecovacs robot vacuum series. It has a lot to live up to\u2014iLifes are known for being affordable workhorses. The A10 does its robot vacuum cousins proud. And if you're worried about delving into a new brand, the A10 is covered by a two-year warranty.\n\nWe liked the fact this stick vacuum cleaner picked up 47% of we laid out for it; for the going rate, the performance is more than impressive. Plus, the A10 has the endurance to match our top pick, around 7 minutes on the max settings and 14 minutes on the regular. Unlike the Dyson, you can buy additional batteries and swap them in for even more cleaning time.\n\nThe A10 comes with the standard assortment of attachments including a crevice tool, a mini-powered brush, and an upholstery brush. While none of these wowed us, we like the fact that the default brush head has bright LED lights to help us spot dirt and debris under furniture.\n\nGet the Tineco A10 Hero on Amazon for $199.90\n\n8. Prolux Ion\n\nProlux Ion (Photo: Prolux)\n\nProlux is best known for its professional cleaning equipment, and the company put its knowhow to use to create the Ion. Our tests showed that the Ion\u2019s battery lasts about 20 minutes while cleaning. While cleaning our carpets, the Ion picked up around 45% of the testing dirt we laid out for it.\n\nThose test results put this cordless in the middle of the pack. We really liked that this is a two-in-one vacuum, with the ability to act as an upright or as a hand vacuum. The hand vac tips the scales at around 3.4 pounds, so it\u2019s a little heavy, but we appreciate that it has the capability.\n\nGet the Prolux Ion on Amazon for $135.79\n\n9. Tineco A11 Master\n\nTineco A11 Master (Photo: Tineco)\n\nThe Tineco A11 Master stands as the best of what the company has to offer. It\u2019s like an affordable Dyson V8\u2014like the V8, it has two different brush heads, one for carpet and one for hardwood. So if you ever find dust sticking to the floor, its specialized brush head may be just the ticket. Beyond the floor, the A11 has tools for cleaning under and around furniture, which we appreciated.\n\nAside from having more tools, the A11 also comes with two batteries. During testing, the two batteries gave us about 14 minutes of cleaning power on the highest setting.\n\nThe downside is that while the A11 apes many of Dyson\u2019s features, it can\u2019t match its power. It required four passes to get our testing area clean while the Dyson V10, for example, needed only two.\n\nGet the Tineco A11 Master on Amazon for $429\n\n10. Kenmore Elite 10441 Complete\n\nKenmore Elite 10441 Complete (Photo: Kenmore)\n\nWhen it comes to vacuums, Kenmore makes some of our favorite models. This time around, the storied company wowed us with its new cordless duo: the Kenmore Elite 10441 Complete and the 10440 Quick Clean. The Complete comes with an additional brush head that specializes in carpets, while the Quick Clean should only be used on bare floors. We also found that the Complete has a telescopic arm to give you that extra reach, should you need it.\n\nWe liked its 13-minute battery life and the fact that it picked up around 45% of the dirt we laid out for it. The Quick Clean was in strong contention for best value model, but it has a relatively high price and it\u2019s heavier than most of the models in this roundup. However, if you like the vibe of Kenmore's canister vacuums, you'll love these two Elite vacuums.\n\nGet the Kenmore Elite 10441 Complete on Amazon for $249.99\n\nHow We Tested\n\nWhen we test cordless vacuums, we\u2019re looking for long battery life, ease of use, and powerful suction. To test battery life, we charge each model for 24 hours. Once charged, each vacuum is run at its highest settings and timed until it stops working. If the vacuum doesn't meet its manufacturer's advertised claim about its total runtime, we take note and adjust our expectations to see if, under laboratory conditions, the vacuum can still adequately do its job.\n\nCleaning shouldn't be complicated, so we take note of how intuitive the design of the vacuum is: Can we figure out how to use it without opening its manual? We also consider the little things: how easy it is to use; and how quickly we can change a vacuum's attachments, plug in the charger, store it, or empty its dirt bin.\n\nTo test cleaning power, we placed 20 grams of 420\u2013595 micron sand on a testing platform covered in medium-pile carpet. (Photo: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan)\n\nTo test cleaning power, we placed 20 grams of sand on a testing platform covered in medium-pile carpet. Before use, this sand is sifted through a specialized mesh to ensure a consistent size of grains between 420 and 595 microns. After evenly spreading the sand across our test platform, we run each vacuum over the carpeted platform once, on max settings. We also check to see if each vacuum could pick up large debris like uncooked rice and macaroni. This test is conducted twice: once with the vacuum's motorized head and once with its crevice tool.\n\nWhat You Should Know About Cordless Vacuums\n\nCan Cordless Vacuums Replace Regular Ones?\n\nFor the most part, cordless vacuums should be viewed as supplementary cleaning tools to be used in between uses of heavier cleaning equipment or in situations where a full-sized vacuum is too cumbersome. That said, if you\u2019re willing to pay a higher price for the privilege, a cordless vacuum can stand toe-to-toe with a full-sized vacuum. Our top pick has a suction force similar to that of a regular vacuum. But, this amount of suction comes at a price: You'll only be able to use the Dyson V11 Torque Drive for this level of cleaning for about 9 minutes before it runs out of power and needs to be recharged.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between Cordless Vacuums and Hand Vacuums?\n\nIn many cases, the only difference between a cordless vacuum and hand vacuum is the cordless vacuum's long extension, which allows the brush head to reach the floor. Although rare, some two-in-one\u2013models come with a handheld vacuum that can be removed and used to clean, without the floor extension\u2014a real bonus when you're cleaning furniture or a flight of stairs.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
