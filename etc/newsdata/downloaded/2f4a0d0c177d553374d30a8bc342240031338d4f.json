Its success represents a public health dilemma for health authorities in the United States and elsewhere. (Photo: EVA HAMBACH/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA lawsuit filed a by former Juul executive alleges that the company knew a batch of contaminated e-liquid had been used in about one million pods shipped to retailers earlier this year, but did not inform customers. The lawsuit, first reported by BuzzFeed, was brought by Siddharth Breja, former senior vice president of global finance at Juul from May 2018 to March 2019, who alleges he was fired after complaining about the contaminated pods.\n\nNews of the lawsuit comes the same day as Juul\u2019s announcement it will lay off about 500 people, or 10% to 15% of its workforce, and the departure of four executives, including chief financial officer Tim Danaher. Juul is currently under scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration, which claims the startup made misleading statements about its product and targeting of teens.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Breja claims that during a meeting on March 12, he learned a contaminated batch of mint e-liquid was used to make 250,000 refill kits, or a total of one million pods, that had already been shipped to retailers.\n\nBreja alleges that when he complained about Juul\u2019s refusal to issue a product recall or health and safety notice, Danaher said doing so would cost the company billions of dollars in lost sales, hurting its then-$38 billion valuation. About a week later, Breja says the company fired him, telling him that it was because he had misrepresented himself as former chief financial officer at Uber. In the lawsuit, Breja says the claim was \u201cpreposterous,\u201d and that he had accurately represented his former position as a chief financial officer of a division at Uber.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Breja also claims that Juul wanted to sell pods that were almost a year old and when he asked the company to include an expiration or best by date, or a date of manufacture on the packaging, he was told by former CEO Kevin Burns that \u201chalf our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fos, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods?\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has contacted Juul and the law firm representing Breja for comment. In a statement to BuzzFeed, Breja\u2019s attorney Harmeet Dhillon said \u201cMr. Breja became aware of very concerning actions at the company, and he performed his duty to shareholders and to the board by reporting these issues internally. In exchange for doing that, he was inappropriatey terminated. This is very concerning, particularly since some of the issues he raised concerned matters of public safety.\u201d\n\nBurns was replaced in September by K.C. Crosthwaite, a former executive at Juul\u2019s largest shareholder Altria . A replacement for Danaher has not been announced yet.", "description": "A lawsuit filed a by former Juul executive alleges that the company knew a batch of contaminated e-liquid had been used in about one million pods shipped to retailers earlier this year, but did not inform customers.
