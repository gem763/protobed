There's just no appetite for either deal and the bankers showed a respect for the individual client and the companies recognize that they have a lot of work to do before their initial public offerings (IPOs) are done.\n\nWeWork was an abomination. It has a lot of work to do, if it can do it. To me, the self-dealing and the insider selling by the CEO are both so revolting that they are going to need to give it away before I would buy it. Looks like the company and the brokers were unwilling to do that.\n\nSaudi Aramco is a company that I don't know a soul who wants unless there is a huge dividend. It's one of those non-companies that would have been forced down our throats so the brokers could make a ton of money. It took an airstrike from 10 drones to have that deal postponed.\n\nBut the elevated prices in the market have brought out sellers and I hate that. For example, Monday night Shopify (SHOP) , the fabulous small business digital empowerment company, sold 1.9 million shares priced at $317.50. Kraft Heinz (KHC) insider 3G sold a small, 25-million-share stake at $28.44. Funko (FNKO) insiders sold 4 million shares.\n\nWe don't want new supply. It's the bane of our existence if we own stocks already.\n\nIt's worth watching -- a very bad trend.", "description": "Jim Cramer thanks heaven that the Saudi Aramco and WeWork IPO deals have been postponed, thankfully, but says there is another bad trend emerging that's worth watching....SHOP", "authors": ["Jim Cramer", "Thank Heaven These Ipos Are No-Gos For Now", "The Saudi Aramco", "Wework Deals Are Postponed", "Thankfully", "But There Is Another Bad Trend Emerging That'S Worth Watching.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bob Lang", "Paul Price", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/442dd195-d468-11e7-a8e6-697ef6b514fb.png"}
