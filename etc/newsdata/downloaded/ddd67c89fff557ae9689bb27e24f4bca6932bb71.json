Josh Hawley of Missouri, Ted Cruz of Texas, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Mike Braun of Indiana accuse the social network of a \u201cpattern of censorship\u201d that \u201creared its ugly head\u201d over pro-life group Live Action\u2019s assertions about abortions being unnecessary medically.\n\nFacebook declared Live Action\u2019s claim to be \u201cfalse,\u201d the senators wrote, noting that the belief that abortion is never necessary is a \u201cwidely held view\u201d and adding that any censorship of that claim proves that Facebook fact-checkers are biased against conservatives.\n\nFacebook did not respond to repeated calls for comment.\n\nEnforcing its \u201cfalse\u201d rating, Facebook stopped Live Action and its founder, Lila Rose, from advertising and promoting its content on the website, according to the letter. Facebook also notified users they had received \u201cfalse\u201d content.\n\n\u201cThis so-called factcheck came as part of a Facebook initiative to combat false news involving partnerships with groups like The Associated Press, Factcheck.org, PolitiFact, and others,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nPublicists for Live Action told media outlets nearly two weeks ago that the group had been \u201csilenced\u201d by Facebook on Aug. 30.\n\n\u201cWith thousands of OB-GYN\u2019s and medical professionals on the record agreeing with us that the direct killing of a child is never medically necessary, it is telling that Facebook decided to fact-check our information, which we have posted about for over three years, using two abortionists for their sourcing,\u201d Ms. Rose wrote.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, a spokeswoman for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a leading medical organization with nearly 60,000 members, pointed to a statement regarding the necessity for access to abortion dating to 2014.\n\n\u201cMany factors influence or necessitate a woman\u2019s decision to have an abortion,\u201d says the statement, noting that health concerns like placental abruption, eclampsia and cardiac arrest \u201cmay be so severe that an abortion is the only measure to preserve a woman\u2019s health or save her life.\u201d\n\nThe senators\u2019 letter cites the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a professional group with nearly 5,000 members, which says that even in late-term pregnancies \u201cwhere the mother\u2019s life actually is in danger,\u201d doctors cannot provide abortions \u201cbecause an abortion typically is a two- to three-day process.\u201d Instead, \u201cimmediate delivery is needed\u201d and can be done via labor induction or C-section, the group says.\n\nThe senators say Facebook relied on testimony from two pro-choice activists to contribute to its so-called Independent Fact Check and called for an external audit.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
