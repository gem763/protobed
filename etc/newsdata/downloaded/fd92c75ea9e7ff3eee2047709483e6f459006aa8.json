The field of record size and diversity includes two African Americans, half a dozen women, an openly gay man and two top candidates seeking to move the United States dramatically to the left.\n\nBut one thing unites them: desire to humiliate former real estate tycoon Trump into becoming only the fourth one-term president since World War II.\n\nOne lead Democratic contender, centrist former vice president Joe Biden, says a \u201cbattle for the soul of America\u201d is underway.\n\nTo which Trump says: Democrats want to \u201cdestroy our country.\u201d\n\nAnd with US intelligence warning that Russia seeks to repeat its 2016 dirty tricks campaign, the possibility of the contest ending in genuine crisis cannot be discounted.\n\n\u201cYou really have to stretch to find an election as combustible and unpredictable as this one,\u201d Allan Lichtman, distinguished professor of history at American University, said.\n\n\u201cThere are very few analogues.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Battle of the bases \u2013\n\nTrump\u2019s fate matters to the globe.\n\nTrade disputes with China and the European Union, the future of NATO, US entanglements in the Middle East and Afghanistan, Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the North Korean nuclear standoff, the Paris climate accord \u2014 there\u2019s a near endless list of major issues that depend on whether or not Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda gets another four years.\n\nBut good luck to anyone trying to predict results.\n\nPolls show Trump down against every serious Democratic candidate. His approval rate is stuck in the low 40 percent range, where it has been most of his presidency.\n\nYet this unpopular president shocked many experts when he defeated heavily favored Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nAnd polls this October by Moody\u2019s Analytics show he could repeat the feat, once again losing the popular vote but easily winning the all-important electoral college vote by focusing on strategically positioned strongholds.\n\nCharles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, says the depth and firmness of Republican-Democratic divisions nationwide mean there\u2019s little middle ground to play for.\n\n\u201cSupport for the president is intense with his base and opposition is, if anything, more intense,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe group to watch,\u201d he said, is the small slice of voters who say they \u201csomewhat approve\u201d of the president. A shift to \u201csomewhat disapprove\u201d could be \u201ca danger signal to the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Impeachment wild card \u2013\n\nImpeachment could yet throw all those considerations out the window.\n\nTrump is accused by Democrats of withholding military aid to compel Ukraine to mount an embarrassing corruption probe against Biden \u2014 in other words using US foreign policy for his personal political benefit.\n\nTrump dismisses the case as cooked up, but Congressional investigators have heard a steady flow of damaging evidence.\n\nA vote to impeach in the Democratic-controlled lower house is seen as near inevitable. Trump would then face trial in the Republican-led Senate.\n\nConviction still seems highly unlikely. Yet even without being removed from office, a House vote to impeach would indelibly mark Trump\u2019s record.\n\nOnly two presidents have been successfully impeached before and at minimum the scandal would fuel bitterness across the country, with unpredictable consequences.\n\n\u2013 Black swans \u2013\n\nImpeachment aside, the quantity of variables one year from voting day is already dizzying.\n\nWill the Democrats nominate an unusually leftwing candidate like Elizabeth Warren, who wants to remake the US economy, or go for the less dynamic, but perhaps safer choice Biden?\n\nPete Buttigieg, a gay small city mayor from Indiana, was so unknown until recently that few could pronounce his name. (It\u2019s Boot-edge-edge). Today, he\u2019s climbing in the polls and seen as a potential dark horse.\n\nAnd Trump, while not the unknown he was four years ago, remains wildly unpredictable, a convention-busting politician able to flip momentum with a tweet.\n\nLast Sunday summed up his roller coaster existence perfectly: bathing in the glow of victory with a morning announcement that US forces had killed the Islamic State leader in Syria, before getting booed at the World Series baseball game in Washington in the evening.\n\nFinally, there are the so-called black swan events \u2014 things so crazy that they are hard to foresee, let alone prepare for.\n\nOne could stem from the expected renewed wave of Russian covert interference \u2014 a well-timed data dump, for example, or a viral conspiracy theory or hacking of voting centers.\n\nIn some quarters there are fears that Trump could even refuse to accept defeat.\n\nThat sounds far-fetched, but the president has spent much of his first term claiming to be fighting off a mysterious deep state coup.\n\nIn the kind of nail-biting recount drama that saw Republican candidate George W. Bush defeat Democrat Al Gore in 2000 thanks to a Supreme Court decision, the brawler Trump would be right in his element.\n\nAll of which adds up to making 2020 the most fraught contest for half a century, Lichtman says.\n\nIn 1968, Richard Nixon won after a traumatizing spell that saw Martin Luther King Jr and Robert F. Kennedy assassinated, violent political protests, and race riots.\n\nUS institutions survived that turmoil. They also survived Nixon\u2019s subsequent resignation, just as they had survived the Civil War, the Great Depression and the civil rights struggle.\n\nBut will the country pull through again?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an open question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lichtman said.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Elections are often described as a horse race but when Donald Trump seeks his second term in 12 months, it\u2019s going to look", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/3a4b00_us-president-donald-trump-reelection-battle-wild-ride-trump-2020-reelection-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
