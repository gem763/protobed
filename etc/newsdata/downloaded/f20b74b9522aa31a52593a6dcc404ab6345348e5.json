The listing plans have long been dogged by questions over valuation and the venue for an international stock-market debut.\n\nThe weekend attack puts into focus another new risk, unusual for most companies planning an IPO: the threat of more attacks that might bottle up production by cutting revenue and profit, or otherwise shake investor confidence in Aramco\u2019s longer-term investment value.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe attack also comes at a sensitive time for Aramco leadership. Khalid al Falih, who until recently led both Aramco, as chairman, and the country\u2019s oil sector, as energy minister, was earlier this month relieved of those positions. Two officials untested by crises of this kind are now in charge: Yaser Rumayyan, who leads Saudi Arabia\u2019s main sovereign-wealth fund, now heads Aramco and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \u2019s older brother, Abdulaziz bin Salman, is just days in to his new job as energy minister.\n\nAfter putting the IPO plans on hold, Saudi Arabia recently ramped them back up, putting a fresh spotlight on its operations. Aramco\u2019s management just recently appointed bankers to advise on the IPO. Saudi oil officials and advisers are now concerned that investors crucial to a successful listing might become skittish about an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s biggest oil plant. Still, they say, there are so far no discussions about a delay in the IPO.\n\nSaturday\u2019s attack on the Abqaiq oil-processing facility cut off 5.7 million barrels a day in production. Saudi officials say they should be able to restore about one-third of that by the end of Monday, and be able to get production back up to normal in coming days, using stored oil and different facilities. But the processing plant sustained significant damage, and getting it back up online fully could take weeks, according to people familiar with the plans.\n\nAramco\u2019s valuation has been a point of contention between Prince Mohammed, who runs the kingdom\u2019s day-to-day affairs, and some bankers. The crown prince and his banking advisers expect the IPO could value the company at roughly $2 trillion and finance an ambitious program to diversify the economy beyond oil. Other bankers and several Aramco executives say the company should be valued at closer to $1.5 trillion. A key metric had long been the price of oil.\n\nThe attacks could now also figure in any investor valuation. If Aramco continues to be a target of attacks, some Saudi officials and advisers say the market might need a further discount of as much as $300 billion.\n\n\u201cThe most natural thing to happen is to see risk premiums rise which would lower the valuation,\u201d one of these officials said. \u201cIn the current valuation, Aramco does not count for serious attacks like these.\u201d\n\nAn Aramco adviser said that even if oil prices spike on the attacks, \u201cthe high risks will offset those hikes in the valuation.\u201d\n\nThe international segment of the company\u2019s stock-market debut could be especially affected by geopolitical risks, Eurasia Group analyst Ayham Kamel said in a note.\n\nAramco owns stakes in refineries in the U.S. and India, but it generates most of its profit from giant oil fields, plants and exports in the kingdom. Saudi officials worry the inability of the Saudi military to fend off attacks against such valuable infrastructure means Aramco won\u2019t command the sort of valuation diversified international oil companies get on the market.\n\nPrince Mohammed initiated the conflict against Houthi rebels in Yemen in 2015. The rebels have intensified the fight recently, with the backing of Iran, and have waged an increasing number of rocket and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn May, Houthis launched attacks on the strategically important East-West Pipeline to the Red Sea, followed last month by an attack on the Shaybah field, which generates about one million barrels of oil a day.\n\n\u201cThese attacks follow a number of others over the last year on Aramco and regional oil-supply-chain assets. But the context has changed with oil prices well off their last 12-month peak,\u201d said Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at financial bank Tellimer. \u201cAll of this suggests greater sensitivity in asset prices to these attacks compared to the precedent ones,\u201d he added.\n\nWrite to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com, Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com", "description": "The attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities are testing new top officials at the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and the kingdom\u2019s national oil ministry, adding fresh risk for investors hoping to take part in Aramco\u2019s initial public offering.", "authors": ["Summer Said In Dubai", "Rory Jones In Dammam", "Saudi Arabia", "Benoit Faucon In London", "Summer Said", "Rory Jones", "Benoit Faucon", "Summer.Said Wsj.Com", "Rory.Jones Wsj.Com", "Benoit.Faucon Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107304/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
