Throughout the history of the American experiment, a bedrock belief is that every person, no matter how powerful, is subject to the law. Knowing full well the scope of human ambition, from its highs to its lows, the founders built the system of checks and balances to ensure that no official, not even the president, could consider himself above the law.\n\nStill, the founders knew that the president and other executive officials would be unique cases if they breached the bounds of legal and ethical conduct. Therefore, the power to impeach was given to Congress. As the Constitution says, plainly and simply, the House has \u201cthe sole power of impeachment\u201d while the Senate holds \u201cthe sole power to try all impeachments.\u201d As for the result of the trial, the Constitution limits the Senate solely to remove the convicted from office and bar them from holding future office, \u201cbut the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.\u201d\n\nSeparating the impeachment from the other legal liabilities of the impeached was a clear delineation that impeachment was separate from the legal system. Furthermore, in Federalist 65, Hamilton wrote of impeachment, \u201cThe subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTherefore, one should read the letter by White House counsel Pat Cipollone to congressional leadership as one act in a broader political drama rather than any clear legal definition of impeachment, even as the letter confused the role of the House inquiry compared to what due process would be afforded in a Senate trial. What is truly stunning, though, is that the White House has decided that it is effectively above the Constitution\u2019s checks and balances, declaring that Congress has no authority to investigate further.\n\nDoubling down on the political element, it also suggested that House Democrats were seeking to undo the 2016 election and influence the 2020 election, ignoring the irony that this entire inquiry is related to influence and interference in the 2020 election. Furthermore, if we begin to weigh one election differently than another, ignoring the 2018 mandate of the Democratic-controlled House, or assume that elections automatically supersede our institutions, then we are on the pathway to becoming a banana republic.\n\nImpeachment too is a unique reflection of the politics of our time. The abrasive, dug-in nature of our current partisanship colors much of this, yet we also have to track how events unfold. With Republicans now breaking, nearly wholesale, from President Trump Donald John TrumpDemocratic 2020 hopefuls tout LGBTQ plans at town hall Trump defends Syria move at rally: 'Bring our troops back home' Pompeo adviser resigning: report MORE on Syria, polls suggesting greater and greater public support for impeachment, and the president\u2019s temperament on full display, the political context becomes even more important.\n\nNo president has been removed from office by impeachment, so there are no direct comparisons, but we can learn from the darkest days of the Watergate scandal before President Richard Nixon resigned from office. Nowhere in the Constitution or in U.S. law did it suggest that the military should ignore any order from Nixon without the approval of then-Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, yet Schlesinger gave such an order to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Even as White House advisers debated their defense of executive prerogatives, Republican leaders met with Nixon to explain that his support in Congress was collapsing. With the political writing on the wall, Nixon would resign the next day.\n\nToday, it remains to be seen whether members of the administration or the Republican caucus will make similar stands, but we are entering one of the greatest political struggles at a time when our country has never been more divided along partisan lines. At the time of Nixon\u2019s impeachment, it had become clear that his behavior and scandals were weakening the presidency, the Republican Party and the country. With the Cold War in full swing and economic stagnation gripping Western economies, congressional leaders knew that Nixon\u2019s resignation would be the only way to move beyond the political crisis for the sake of the nation and its institutions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, a similarly complex geopolitical and economic context \u2014 balanced with political considerations of party loyalty and Twitter-launched primary threats \u2014 will weigh on some members of Congress far more than the prerogatives of their institution or the overall rule of law. Yet, it is those institutions and the rule of law that we will count on to solve challenges beyond impeachment.\n\nImpeachment will not lower the cost of health care, nor will it secure our southern border. It will not fix our infrastructure or modernize our education system. It will be up to the same institutions to do the people\u2019s business during and after impeachment, so we cannot let them be destroyed by partisanship and politics in the process.\n\nDan Mahaffee is the senior vice president and director of policy at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress in Washington.", "description": "\u201cWherever law ends, tyranny begins.\u201d These words, from \u201cTwo Treatises of Government\u201d by John Locke, are part of the foundational texts of American political philosophy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/constitution_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
