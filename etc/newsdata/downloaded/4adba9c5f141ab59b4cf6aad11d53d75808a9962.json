This affects all two billion-plus of their users because it means what we see on Facebook, the news, the information, is being controlled by politically-biased employees,\" Rose told \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nThe comments came after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted to lawmakers last week that there was bias in the company's handling of a fact-checking controversy involving the pro-life group.\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN'T OFFER PROTECTION FROM DEEPFAKES, NEW REPORT SAYS\n\nThe embattled tech executive discussed the issue during a meeting with Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a frequent critic of Big Tech, on a host of topics, including privacy and allegations of anti-conservative discrimination.\n\nRose said Zuckerberg is not admitting the bias publicly, despite what he apparently told senators behind closed doors.\n\nLast month, Live Action was told by Facebook that its fact-checkers had marked two videos containing the statement \"abortion is never medically necessary\" as false. The tech giant also said that Live Action, its links and Rose's page would now have reduced distribution and other restrictions because of repeatedly sharing false news.\n\n\u201cFacebook decided to use two abortionists to fact check our content and say we were false and this is content we have been saying for years,\u201d Rose said.\n\nFACEBOOK TO CRACK DOWN ON EXTREMISM BY TRAINING AI WITH POLICE VIDEOS\n\nOne video, titled \u201cThe Pro-Life Reply to \u2018Abortion Can Be Medically Necessary\u2019,\u201d features neonatologist Dr. Kendra Kolb.

Live Action and Rose's Facebook page reach more than 3 million followers combined.\n\n\u201cFacebook has not formed its fact-checking system. They\u2019re still using politics to regulate content on their platform,\u201d Rose said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFacebook removed the strikes against Live Action two weeks ago while the fact-checking organization, known as Science Feedback, conducts an internal review of what took place.\n\nFox News' James Rogers and Judson Berger contributed to this report.", "description": "Live-Action President Lila Rose said that Facebook\u2019s\u2019 news information is being controlled by politically biased Facebook employees.\u201d", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-23-at-10.54.52-AM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
