It was introduced in September and intended to be a seasonal item.\n\nPricing and availability for avocados \u2013 which were in short supply and high demand during a summer of record-high prices \u2013 has stabilized, officials said. Some locations had guacamole shortages.\n\nJohn Hartung, Chipotle\u2019s chief financial officer, said a more plentiful harvest of avocados is expected next year.\n\n\u201cWe expect ongoing moderation in avocado pricing as a result of increasing supply in the back half of the quarter,\u201d Hartung said, noting the company also got more supply from Peru and reduced its reliance on Mexico.\n\nUpping its stake in steak: Chipotle adds carne asada to menu for a limited time\n\nMore new menu items are expected and Chipotle is currently testing quesadillas, salads, and a new queso called Queso Blanco, CEO Brian Niccol said.\n\nThe new and whiter queso is being tested in Detroit, Dallas and San Diego, Chris Brandt, Chipotle chief marketing officer, said in an interview with USA TODAY.\n\n\u201cThe queso is performing really well in all three of the markets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think that will be ready to go at some point in 2020.\u201d\n\nAlong with looking at adding more choices, the chain is planning new locations. Hartung said they plan to open 140 to 155 in the current fiscal year and then 150 to 165 new restaurants in 2020. More than half of the new locations will have a Chipotlane, a special drive-thru.\n\nSpotify freebie: Spotify giving away free Google Home Minis for new, existing users.
