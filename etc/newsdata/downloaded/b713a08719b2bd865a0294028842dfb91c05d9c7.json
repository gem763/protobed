REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/File Photo/File Photo\n\nRelations with Australia\u2019s most important trading partner have deteriorated in recent years amid accusations that China is meddling in domestic affairs. Canberra also fears China is seeking undue influence in the Pacific region.\n\nSouring relations have strained bilateral trade, prompting some business executives to urge Australia\u2019s conservative government to prioritize economic policy above social advocacy.\n\nHowever, Australia would not be silenced, Payne said late on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe must respect each other\u2019s sovereignty, but we will consistently continue to raise issues such as human rights, including, as I have said, with China,\u201d she said in a foreign policy speech in Sydney.\n\n\u201cTurning a blind eye to all human rights violations means an acceptance of behavior that undermines the foundations of international peace and stability. Where there is no challenge, there is no progress,\u201d Payne said.\n\n\u201cWe have also addressed the treatment of the Uighur people in Xinjiang province in China,\u201d she added.\n\nChina has been widely condemned for setting up complexes in remote Xinjiang it describes as \u201cvocational training centers\u201d intended to stamp out extremism and teach new skills.\n\nThe United Nations says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained.\n\nIn Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Payne had \u201cignored the facts\u201d, particularly with her remarks in Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cThis is really not good, and does not benefit the improvement and development of the two countries\u2019 relations,\u201d he told a daily new briefing.\n\n\u201cChina has already lodged stern representations with Australia about this, to say this way of doing things is very inappropriate.\n\n\u201cWe hope the Australian side can reflect on, and learn, the lessons of the recent disturbances in Sino-Australian relations.\u201d\n\nTrade between the two countries was worth more than A$180 billion ($123.48 billion) last year.\n\nHowever, several Australian lawmakers have stepped up criticism of China in recent weeks, despite the risk to trade.\n\nChina was targeting political parties and universities, Home Minister Peter Dutton said this month, triggering a strong reaction from Beijing.\n\nIn September, Reuters reported that Australian intelligence had held China responsible for a cyber-attack on the national parliament and three largest political parties before a general election in May.\n\nRelated Coverage China says lodges stern representations to Australia on human rights comments\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry denied involvement in any hacking attacks and said the internet was full of theories that were hard to trace.\n\nPayne\u2019s comments came just hours before she traveled to the Solomon Islands, which switched diplomatic ties to Beijing from Taiwan in September.\n\nAustralia has moved in recent years to challenge China\u2019s expansion of financial and political influence in the Pacific, which Canberra considers its historical domain.", "description": "Canberra will hold China to account on issues such as human rights, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne has said, insisting that staying quiet on sensitive issues is not in the national interest, in comments that drew a rebuke from China.", "authors": ["Colin Packham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446392355&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T05U", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
