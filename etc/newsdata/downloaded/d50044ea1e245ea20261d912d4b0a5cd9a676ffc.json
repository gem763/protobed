Lining the fence outside the closed Tree of Life building were 11 flowerpots, each one bearing the name of one of those killed. People also piled bouquets and crocheted hearts at the site and hung signs on the fence saying the city was \u201cstronger than hate\u201d and calling diversity its strength.\n\n\u201cToday we remember those we lost and come together as a commonwealth to stand united as neighbors,\u201d said a Twitter message from Governor Tom Wolf, who is scheduled to attend a memorial service in Pittsburgh on Sunday evening.\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s sports teams joined other organizations in honoring the victims. Steelers president Art Rooney II said Sunday that fans will be asked at Monday night\u2019s game to stand for a moment of silence for the victims and their families. The Pittsburgh Penguins said \u201cHatred and discrimination have no place in Pittsburgh or anywhere else,\u201d and the Pittsburgh Pirates echoed that sentiment, saying the memory of the victims \u201cwill always be a reminder that hatred has no place in our world.\u201d\n\nThe synagogue\u2019s three congregations now worship at two nearby synagogues. Last week, Tree of Life leaders unveiled their vision for the damaged building: a rebuilt space for places of worship; memorial, education and social events; and classrooms and exhibitions.\n\nThe commemoration\u2019s theme is \u201cRemember. Repair. Together.\u201d It includes a private Jewish service, studying the portion of the Torah that was to be read when the shooting happened, opportunities to do community service, and a public memorial service.\n\nSeveral hundred people had registered to volunteer at various community organizations on Sunday. In Germany, the Clarion Quartet, comprised of Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra musicians, was to perform at a special event in Berlin.\n\nThousands were expected to participate in Sunday\u2019s remembrance through Pause With Pittsburgh, a virtual memorial event created by the Jewish Federations of North America.\n\nAuthorities charged Robert Bowers, 47, a truck driver from Baldwin, Pennsylvania, in the massacre. Investigators say he used an AR-15 rifle and other weapons, and posted criticism of an immigrant aid society on social media before the attack, claiming the Jewish charity \u201clikes to bring invaders that kill our people.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.", "description": "PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 The first anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history was being marked around the world Sunday with community service", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/27/60b3dd_aptopix-synagogue-shooting-anniversary-21171-mother-hugs-her-son-in-memorial-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
