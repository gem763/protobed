So Don Jr., Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner should have known going in that if the offer was genuine, the oppo useful, it might involve stolen goods.\n\nBut on the basis of the emails, the younger Trump went in not skeptically but eagerly (\u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it\u201d), ignoring or simply accepting the weird formulation about Russian support for Trump\u2019s campaign. And then of course everybody lied about or \u201cforgot\u201d about the meeting, repeatedly and consistently, right up until the emails themselves made their way to the press.\n\nSo while this is not direct evidence that the president of the United States was complicit in a virtual burglary perpetrated against the other party during an election season, it\u2019s strong evidence that we should drop the presumption that such collusion is an extreme or implausible scenario.\n\nInstead, the mix of inexperience, incaution and conspiratorial glee on display in the emails suggests that people in Trump\u2019s immediate family \u2014 not just satellites like Roger Stone \u2014 would have been delighted to collude if the opportunity presented itself. Indeed, if the Russians didn\u2019t approach the Trump circle about how to handle the D.N.C. email trove, it was probably because they recognized that anyone this na\u00efve, giddy and \u201cBurn After Reading\u201d-level stupid would make a rather poor espionage partner.\n\nThen keep in mind, too, that all of this has come out (relatively) easily, thanks to digging by this newspaper\u2019s reporters and leaks from the various factions in and around the White House, without the subpoenas and immunity deals that the formal investigations have at their disposal. That means there is probably more and worse to come, and the more there is, the worse the president\u2019s dealings with James Comey look. Even if the president himself is innocent of Russian collusion, protecting your family from exposure is a pretty strong motive for obstruction.\n\nIn the end, impeachment is political, not legal, and the House G.O.P. probably won\u2019t impeach for anything short of a transcript of a call between Trump and Putin in which the words \u201cyes, I want you to hack their servers big-league, Vladimir\u201d appear in black-and-white. And even then \u2026.\n\nBut right now, the 2018 congressional elections promise to be a de facto referendum on impeachment. There are enough sparks in the smoke; there will probably be fire for some of Trump\u2019s intimates before another year is out.\n\nAnd as for the president himself \u2014 well, to conclude where I began, anyone presuming his innocence at this point should have all the confidence of Chris Christie awaiting his cabinet appointment, or Sean Spicer reading over the day\u2019s talking points.
