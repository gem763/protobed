Economists surveyed weekly by the central bank see the Selic at 5% at year\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cThe consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation should permit additional adjustment of the degree of stimulus,\u201d the bank said in the statement announcing the rate cut.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s survey predicts inflation will end the year at 3.45%, well below the bank\u2019s target of 4.25%. The economists also forecast meager 0.87% gross-domestic-product growth, a pace unlikely to significantly reduce the country\u2019s 11.8% jobless rate.\n\nThe rate-cutting cycle started in July will take time to show any effect on the real economy, said Western Asset\u2019s chief economist in Brazil, Adauto Lima. He said consumers remain cautious, and unused production capacity means businesses have little reason to invest, giving the bank room to reduce rates more.\n\n\u201cInflation is so low, and we are so close to the end of the year that there could be room for more cuts in subsequent meetings.\u201d he said. \u201cThe landscape remains very benign\u201d for prices.\n\nThe central bank has two more meetings this year, on Oct. 30 and Dec. 11\n\nBrazil\u2019s weak economic growth has prevented business from passing the cost of the recent depreciation of the real against the dollar on to consumers, Mr. Lima added. The real is trading at about 4.10 to the dollar, after reaching 3.74 in July.\n\nThe depreciation is part of a global weakening among emerging-market currencies, paired with domestic problems, economists say. The administration of Brazil\u2019s new president, Jair Bolsonaro, is still working to put in place its agenda of economic changes it says would boost growth.\n\nMr. Bolsonaro has promised to trim government costs and cut the red tape he blames, at least partially, for sluggish business activity. His administration is pushing a sweeping pension overhaul that is forecast to save more than $200 billion over 10 years and is expected to be approved by the Senate in October. The administration is also calling for a simplification of Brazil\u2019s complex tax code, while preparing a pipeline of privatizations.\n\nThe planned changes, which would extend market-friendly overhauls begun in 2016 after President Dilma Rousseff of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party was removed from office, are likely to ensure relatively low borrowing costs in Brazil after decades of double-digit rates, according to Rafael Cardoso, an economist from Daycoval Asset investment firm.\n\nLegislation passed under Ms. Rousseff\u2019s successor capping public spending and simplifying labor law, among other changes, is already allowing interest rates to remain at historic lows without triggering inflation. As Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s economic proposals advance through Congress, the central bank might decide it can keep its benchmark lending rate at 5% through 2021, according to Mr. Cardoso.\n\n\u201cBrazil\u2019s conditions have improved, meaning there\u2019s less solvency risk, which allows for lower rates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can now live with lower borrowing costs.\u201d\n\nWrite to Paulo Trevisani at paulo.trevisani@wsj.com and Jeffrey T.
