Now, with the world\u2019s growth outlook decidedly downbeat, Columbia Threadneedle Investments is positioning for the greenback to strengthen against the euro by more than many forecasters are predicting over the next three to six months.\n\nA trio of catalysts should support the dollar through the first quarter, according to Columbia Threadneedle\u2019s Ed Al-Hussainy: U.S. rates exceed most other developed nations, domestic inflation is in a \u201cbetter place\u201d than Europe\u2019s, and global growth expectations are being downgraded. The senior analyst says the $469 billion asset manager is prepared for the greenback to strengthen toward parity -- a level it hasn\u2019t traded at since 2002 -- against the euro, from $1.11 currently, despite the common currency rallying almost 2% against it in October.\n\nEconomic theory suggests the dollar should move in the same direction as interest rates, but reality shows that\u2019s not always the case. At the moment, a mix of positive and negative U.S. data, along with occasional progress on trade and Brexit, are complicating Fed policy makers\u2019 assessment of the economy heading into their two-day meeting in Washington. After Wednesday\u2019s widely-expected reduction, it\u2019s unclear whether the central bank will cut rates again soon.\n\n\u201cThe theory that the dollar should be weakening, along with the Fed lowering rates, depends on whether the rest of the world is in a steady state, with no radical changes in policy being undertaken,\u201d said Scott Kimball, a Miami-based bond portfolio manager whose team oversees $12 billion for BMO Global Asset Management.\n\n\u201cInstead, it\u2019s the exact opposite: Central banks are messing with policy in atypical ways and, in the midst of that, everyone is scrambling toward liquidity doors,\u201d Kimball said by phone. \u201cNegative rates overseas and weak currencies abroad are going to continue to drive people into positive rates and strong opportunities. There\u2019s nothing we see that\u2019s going to deter the dollar, even in these unusual times.\u201d\n\nKimball said he sees the greenback rising \u201cfor a painfully long time\u201d as capital flows from around the world pour into the U.S. and global interest-rate policies drive investors into American bonds, which offer higher rates. As a result, he says he\u2019s been buying more intermediate- and long-term corporate bonds.\n\nOvernight index swaps indicate that markets have priced in a rate cut for October, and the next one in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nThe last time the dollar largely held onto its strength into a recession was before, during and after the 2001 downturn fueled by the Internet bubble\u2019s collapse and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThat year, the Fed cut rates a total of 11 times in 25- and 50-basis-point increments, but the rose 6.6% from the end of 2000 through the end of 2001. At the time, the dollar appreciated sharply on perceived safe-haven flows, even while the economy was sliding into recession and fundamentals were \u201cdeteriorating,\u201d said Ben Randol, an FX strategist at Bank of America (NYSE: ).\n\nThe bank sees the dollar appreciating against most currencies except the yen into year-end. Though the greenback is overvalued, unresolved global tensions are one factor that \u201ccan keep it on a rising path,\u201d Randol said. On the flip side, \u201ca potentially less threatening global backdrop\u201d could cause the dollar to weaken in 2020, he added.\n\nGranted, there are more than a few people suggesting the greenback may already be at or near its peak. Commerzbank\u2019s Ulrich Leuchtmann and Scotiabank currency strategist Shaun Osborne say softer U.S. growth may help undermine the currency\u2019s haven appeal.\n\nBut even those awaiting a dollar bear market are having a hard time identifying when that might happen. Alessio de Longis, a New York-based multi-asset fund manager at Invesco, says it would take a sustainable rebound in growth outside the U.S., particularly in Europe and emerging markets, and \u201cright now we\u2019re not seeing that catalyst yet.\u201d For the time being, he\u2019s bullish on the Mexican and Colombian pesos and Brazilian real, and using the Swiss franc, Australian and New Zealand dollars as funding currencies.\n\nWhile a U.S. recession is hardly inevitable, the domestic data is on a \u201cknife edge\u201d and the \u201cmargin of safety in 2020 is eroding,\u201d Al-Hussainy said via email. To support growth next year, it would take some combination of steady consumer spending, lower rates, a weaker dollar and fiscal stimulus in the U.S., Europe or China, he says.\n\n(Updates with market pricing for Fed rate cut in eighth paragraph)", "description": "Dollar Looks Poised to Weather Fed Cuts and Recession Risk", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic8cdff125307029bbc6f886a8539b5de3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
