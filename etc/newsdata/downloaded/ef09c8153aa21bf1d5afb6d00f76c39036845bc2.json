Vicente Gonzalez switching his support for former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nGonzalez was one of three Texas representatives who endorsed the former HUD secretary, along with Castro's twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro, and Rep. Colin Allred. Gonzalez announced his endorsement for Castro in March, saying at the time: \"I know firsthand his passion for expanding opportunity for the Latino community, people of color, and historically disenfranchised communities, as well as his unparalleled dedication to building a bench of dynamic Democratic candidates in Texas and nationally.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGonzalez announced his switch to CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday morning saying: \"I think at this point in time we need to narrow the field and unite as Democrats to defeat Trump in November 2020. And that is why I believe I'm moving my support to Vice President Joe Biden.\"\n\nCastro and Biden went head to head at the third Democratic debate Thursday, with Castro going after the former vice president for his record on health care policy and for focusing so heavily on his ties to former President Barack Obama.\n\nDuring one of the most dramatic moments of the debate, Castro accused Biden of wanting to \"take credit\" for Obama's accomplishments when it convenes him, but distances himself from the former president on policy that has grown unpopular.\n\n\"I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not,\" Castro said during the debate.\n\nBiden is currently polling ahead of the Democratic field, with Castro trailing well behind. Gonzalez, in explaining his switch, noted that Castro was \u201cpolling in the low single digits.\u201d", "description": "He cites the need for Democratic unity.", "authors": ["Matthew Choi"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b0/c3/b3dbdedb4cc0ad42877821925b8b/190915-julian-castro-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
