The company noted on the earnings call part of that was due to including costs associated with facilities that have yet to start producing.\n\nSelling CBD products\n\nFor his part, Linton advocated for Canopy to bring in a tech-minded female to take his old role, with the hope being that she could keep the company focused on scaling to win the global cannabis opportunity.\n\nOne of the last opportunities Linton himself was focused on before parting ways with the company he co-founded was the opportunity to develop and sell CBD products in the U.S. It was also part of the reason why Linton steered the company to spend nearly $55 million on acquiring skincare company This Works, with the hope that infusing creams with CBD could be a big revenue driver for Canopy. As CEO, Linton made the bold call that Canopy\u2019s push into CBD would culminate in becoming the U.S. CBD market share leader by the end of the year. He still sees that as feasible.\n\n\u201cI know the people running the Canopy CBD stuff for the U.S. \u2014 unbelievable team,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if any company can actually crush it on this topic... it\u2019ll be these guys.\u201d\n\nZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
