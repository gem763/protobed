On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Fevertree Drinks Plc (LON:FEVR).\n\nWhat Is Insider Buying?\n\nIt's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.\n\nWe don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'\n\nSee our latest analysis for Fevertree Drinks\n\nFevertree Drinks Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Non-executive Director Kevin Havelock bought UK\u00a3290k worth of shares at a price of UK\u00a321.99 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is UK\u00a323.16. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. The good news for Fevertree Drinks share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price.\n\nHappily, we note that in the last year insiders bought 23958 shares for a total of UK\u00a3569k. Fevertree Drinks insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions.
