And unfortunately we have somebody who I feel doesn\u2019t have a grasp of the deep meaning of what it means to be an American.\u201d\n\nMr. Springsteen, 70, made the remark in response to being asked about remaining a target of the president\u2019s \u201ctrash-talking,\u201d years after the acclaimed singer and songwriter campaigned for Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2016 race, former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need Beyonce and Jay-Z.
