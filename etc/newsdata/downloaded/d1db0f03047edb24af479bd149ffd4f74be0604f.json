There\u2019s an official name for Android Q: it\u2019s just Android 10. This week also saw Mark Gurman\u2019s traditional rumor drop of everything to expect at Apple\u2019s upcoming iPhone event. It\u2019s a lot, and it\u2019s all fodder for Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Paul Miller to talk about.\n\nPromises we can make to you about this episode: there\u2019s no alliteration of a thousand Q words, no discussion of Bixby actually being a secret dog butler, and no way for you to opt out of any privacy clauses by leaving a rating and a review on Apple Podcasts for this show. (But if you did the last thing anyway, we\u2019d appreciate it.)\n\nOn top of all that, Paul explains what\u2019s up with the laptops featuring Intel\u2019s newest chips. Dieter can\u2019t handle Samsung\u2019s plot to make green bubbles cool. Nilay has feelings about the Sonos, AirPlay 2, the Apple Card, Goldman Sachs, and denim. Dieter also discusses Holo Taco nail polish. It\u2019s been that kind of week.\n\nStories discussed this week:", "description": "This week: the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus, DeX, the cameras, Android Q, Apple\u2019s upcoming iPhone event, the Apple Card, Sonos, Bose, and much more from Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Paul Miller.", "authors": ["Dieter Bohn", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNXy60sLCmbnrNCPcHC6UlHztLo=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19085122/akrales_190819_3594_0589.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
