There's been a bunch of promising leaks, some of which have already turned out to be true, so let's round them all up to see what's most likely in store for Pixel fans.

Essentially, it allows users to customise their devices' themes with options for everything from font selection to the colours used.\n\nAccording to 9to5Google, you'll be able to customise fonts, icons, colour themes and icon shapes. It's unclear if that's all that will be available at this stage.\n\nI can't wait for Google Pixel 4, give me it now!\n\nAccording to 9to5Google, to get it now, you'll need to do some sideloading, which means risk. Sideloading is when you download apps outside of the device's included app store and install them on your phone. It can be risky because you're circumventing an app store's security measures and downloading apps, which could potentially contain malware or other bad stuff.\n\nIf you're happy to risk it, download the Styles and Wallpapers app and then the Pixel Themes APK as well as the Pixel Wallpapers APK.\n\nThe themes will now be available in the Style tab of your wallpaper section. But 9to5Google warns it won't work just yet. For that, you'll need to enter the following ADB command.\n\nadb shell pm grant com.google.android.apps.wallpaper android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS\n\nIf that sounds like too much effort, you could just wait until the Pixel 4 is released.\n\nCreate Your Own Live Wallpaper For Your Android Device With 'KLWP' Nobody likes a boring home screen. And while you get a number of default options within Android to pretty up your device, you can get a lot more creative if you build your own live wallpaper.
