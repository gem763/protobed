But it allows GM to close three U.S. factories, a point of contention for many of the 42.8 percent of workers who voted no.\n\nThe new contract is expected to add roughly $350 million in annual labor costs by the end of the contract according to a note from Barclays analyst Brian Johnson reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThat kind of labor-cost inflation may be tougher for Ford and Fiat Chrysler to absorb.\n\nUAW STRIKES DEAL WITH MACK TRUCKS\n\nAlthough GM dealers had stocked up on vehicles before the strike and many still have decent supplies, analysts say GM won't be able to make up for the lost production. Had the strike been shorter, GM could have increased assembly line speeds and worked the plants on overtime to catch up and refill its stock.\n\nBut many of the plants that make popular SUVs and pickup trucks already were working around the clock to keep up with demand before the strike began.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAlso, companies that supply parts to the factories and halted production during the strike will need time to restart, although GM has some parts in stock.\n\nFOX Business' Evie Fordham, Thomas Barrabi and the Associated Press contributed to this article.", "description": "The labor-cost inflation from the GM contract may be tough for Ford and Fiat Chrysler to absorb.", "authors": ["Ken Martin"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/gm-ford-chrysler-logos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
