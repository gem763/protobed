Three hours, maybe even three and a half, but that was long enough. A burly ex-guard led my tour party round his former workplace. He\u2019d written a memoir, which he kept mentioning as he took us through the bleak horrors. Gleefully, he led us into the concrete recreation yard, the library, the kitchen. At the climax came the solitary confinement cell \u2013 \u201cthe Hole\u201d. It was basically a coffin with a slightly higher ceiling. \u201cFor five extra bucks,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can stay inside, individually, and I\u2019ll slam the door on you.\u201d I didn\u2019t take up the offer. A long queue of others did. I listened to the iron door go slam, slam, slam.\n\nLooking back, I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t shell out for the experience. Like many people, I am obsessed with tales of great escapes. Tension/release is how most stories work. But the rawest, most extreme form is confinement/escape. And the more extreme the confinement, the more exhilarating the escape. Of course, there are lots of different ways a person can be in prison, and you don\u2019t always have to get outside your particular prison to get away from it.\n\nI was quite a few years into writing my novel Patience before I realised it was \u2013 among other things \u2013 a kind of prison-break story. The prison is a Catholic children\u2019s home in 1979, and the prisoner is a boy called Elliott who can move only one finger, but the basic obsessive situation of confinement/escape is the same. Elliott yearns to be free.\n\nHere are 10 of my favourite great escapes, because sometimes Steve McQueen\u2019s motorcycle does make it over the barbed wire fence.\n\n1. Persuasion by Jane Austen\n\nAnne Elliot is the oldest of Austen\u2019s heroines, and the longest-suffering. In order to reach her happy ending, she endures years of confinement. She isn\u2019t literally in solitary, but \u2013 as an unmarried not-so-young woman, dependent on her demanding father, she is as trapped as any prisoner. Worse still, she has no true companionship. She is surrounded by a grotesque gallery of the neurotic and the interfering, the boring and the presumptuous. Only the reader knows Anne\u2019s true worth. Her victorious escape from the hell of the English country house to be together with her true love, Captain Wentworth, makes her years of anguish worthwhile \u2013 almost.\n\n2. The Peregrine by JA Baker\n\nChasing an elusive bird of prey around 1960s Essex, we track an even more elusive author. This was chosen by Werner Herzog as one of the course books for his Rogue Film School \u2013 where he teaches lock-picking alongside cinematography. I applied in order to make a film version of Patience, but didn\u2019t get on. Discovering this renowned classic of nature writing was some consolation. In its pages, a man tries to escape his human nature. The final encounter between man and bird is visionary.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hitler in his sights \u2026 Peter O\u2019Toole in the 1976 film of Rogue Male. Photograph: TCD/Prod DB/Alamy\n\n3. Rogue Male by Geoffrey Household\n\nThis novel begins with the most brutal chase sequence. Ten pages in, and you\u2019ve winced so many times your face is aching. The main character is more like an animal fleeing a pack of hounds than a human protagonist. Eventually, he is forced to go to ground. And then the tension really starts. All of this is based on the gossamer premise that an English gentleman decides one day, out of curiosity, to see if he can assassinate Adolf Hitler.\n\n4. The Long Way by Bernard Moitessier, translated by William Rodarmor\n\nSome people escape from concrete jails. For others safe, normal life is the worst imprisonment. In 1968, Moitessier \u2013 already a legendary sailor \u2013 is planning to sail solo around the world, without touching land. He can\u2019t be doing with shore life. When he hears about the Golden Globe yacht race, he decides to join in. He has the chance to win and gain the glory. But as he is sailing towards the finish, he realises it just another entrapment. If there\u2019s such a thing as enlightenment, Moitessier found it halfway across the South Atlantic.\n\n5. Tramp by Tomas Espedal, translated by James Anderson\n\nWhere Moitessier needs a bespoke sailboat, and plenty of supplies, to make his escape from the unbearableness of the day-to-day, Tomas Espedal needs only to step outside the door, decide whether to turn left or right, and just keep walking. This existentially narked Norwegian feels imprisoned by his limited world \u2013 his flat, the local bar where he drinks and then drinks some more. When this gets too much for him, he walks. But he refuses to wear hiking gear, preferring a suit. He loves to chain smoke as he goes, so as to annoy the more conservative ramblers. This is a deep and hilarious book about small truancies.\n\n6. How to Be Gay by David M Halperin\n\nNot everyone can run away from their captors. Some have to live with them for ever. But that doesn\u2019t mean they have to live in the same way as them. This is a wonderful, personal history of the many ways the constraints of the straight world have been subverted or co-opted by gay culture. \u201cWhy Are the Drag Queens Laughing?\u201d asks one section of the book. Until I read this, I can honestly say I had absolutely no idea.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A page from Hostage by Guy Delisle. Illustration: Cape\n\n7. Hostage by Guy Delisle, translated by Helge Dascher\n\nFor the longest time, this graphic novel is confined to the limited doings and far-straying thoughts of a bearded man lying on a mattress, his left wrist handcuffed to a radiator. But what could be dull is mesmerising. It is based on interviews with Christopher Andre, who was taken hostage in 1997, while working in Chechnya for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. The escape is super-tense.\n\n8. Papillon by Henri Charri\u00e8re, translated by Patrick O\u2019Brian\n\nAnother true story, Charri\u00e8re\u2019s merciless account of his incarceration in French Guiana, and his failed and successful escape bids, became a worldwide phenomenon when it was published in 1969. From childhood, I still remember the chunky paperback, with its cover image of a butterfly (papillon is French for butterfly) resting on a heavy padlock. There it was, on beaches and restaurant tables. It seemed as if my parents were reading it for most of the decade. With good reason. Some say this is the greatest of all escapes.\n\n9. \u00c1gua Viva by Clarice Lispector, translated by Stefan Tobler\n\nA recent discovery, this is a fictional account of a woman\u2019s attempt to escape from conventional time and exist instead in a perpetually renewing \u201cthis instant-now\u201d. Lispector pursued this same seemingly impossible aim through a number of books \u2013 getting closer and closer to the confused and thrilling feeling of fully conscious aliveness. Agua Viva is where she succeeds most amazingly.\n\nTop 10 ghost stories Read more\n\n10. The Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester\n\nWhen I asked my friends for their favourite books of escape, The Count of Monte Cristo was so frequently and fondly picked that it seems silly to leave it out. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve never read it. And so for my ultimate selection I\u2019m going for this novel, (sometimes known as Tiger! Tiger!). It\u2019s a sci-fi riff on Dumas\u2019 adventure classic, and starts with the tensest escape I know. The hero is trapped on a devastated spaceship \u2013 only a single compartment contains an air supply. And this has almost run out. From start to finish, this is a series of outlandish and nerve-shredding escapades. As, I\u2019m sure, is The Count of Monte Cristo \u2013 into the thousand pages of which I plan to make my escape this autumn.\n\n\u2022 Patience by Toby Litt (Galley Beggar Press, \u00a39.99).
