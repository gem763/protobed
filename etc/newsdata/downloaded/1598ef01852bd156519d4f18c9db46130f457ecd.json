That is the single worst thing in my opinion that you could do to somebody, and particularly as a fighter in this profession.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the past several years, since the company adopted U.S. Anti-Doping Agency-administered testing, it has become increasingly apparent that tainted supplements used by fighters who are not intending to cheat is a real thing, and not simply an excuse made after one gets caught.\n\nThe UFC has worked for much of this year to amend the policy in a common-sense manner that doesn\u2019t unfairly punish fighters who clearly did not intend to break the rules, while also continuing to catch those who are in fact deliberately running afoul of the program.\n\nAnd right before the policy was set to be formally announced \u2014 UFC VP of Athlete Health and Performance Jeff Novtizky said at a California State Athletic Commission meeting in Los Angeles last week that changes would be announced \u201cin a couple weeks\u201d \u2014 Diaz got snagged, less than two weeks before his major headlining fight against Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244, the fruition of Campbell\u2019s \u201cnightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nDiaz had an atypical reading in an out-of-competition for traces of LGD-4033, or Ligandrol, a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) which builds lean muscle mass, in a recent out-of-competition USADA test.\n\nDating back to an agreement in principle with USADA on Aug. 31, the company has reinstated fighters who have tested for less than 100 picograms/mL of certain substances, which can show up in tainted supplements or meat. Welterweight Neil Magny was among those who tested for microscopic levels of LGD-4033 and was reinstated after a provisional suspension, which was levied under the old system.\n\nNovitzky said Diaz tested in double-digit picograms for LGD-4033 which showed up in an organic, vegan multivitamin, and termed it \u201ccomfortably under\u201d the 100-picogram threshold. He also stated that Diaz would have to take 10,000 capsules of the multivitamin in order to get get a performance-enhancing benefit.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t guesswork,\u201d Novitzky said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing guesswork about the Nate Diaz case. It is as rock solid evidence as I\u2019ve ever seen in the history of my anti-doping career when it comes to a contaminant. To say he did anything wrong, you\u2019d have to say, \u2018You did something wrong by choosing a plant-based, vegan, organic multivitamin that said on the label they were lab tested.\u2019 Somebody can say he did something wrong on that? It\u2019s a shame if they would. The guy did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nDiaz was adamant his name be cleared, which apparently led to Thursday\u2019s social media post that announced he was out.\n\n\u201cWhat was important to Nate, immediately, before anything he put out there or anything he commented, as it was conveyed to us, was that he be cleared,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThat was the single most important thing for Nate. And I think what was telling in the statement that he put out, animated as it was, as he usually is, it highlights exactly, what I think the evolution of the anti-doping world is starting to show, Nate\u2019s comment was \u2018I don\u2019t cheat, I only take plant-based vegan,\u2019 \u2026 what he basically had contaminated was exactly what he believed it was. A plant-based, vegan, organic multivitamin. Period. End of discussion.\u201d\n\nLater, Novitzky added \u201cIt was a supplement that clearly was not marketed as a workaround that you see with certain supplements, saying \u2018you absolutely should have known based on packaging or the presentation that this substance was in it.\u2019 The label was clearly set forth .. it looks like the most innocuous, daily multivitamin. It wasn\u2019t \u2018Jacked 5000\u2019 or \u2018Black Rhino.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs of this writing late Friday night, Diaz himself has not stated whether he is back in the fight. Campbell, for his part, said \u201cI have every reason to believe he is in.\u201d\n\nCampbell and Novitzky also noted that the New York State Athletic Commission has been kept abreast of the situation every step of the way, although the commission itself has yet to make a statement.\n\nUSADA issued a brief statement Friday night. \u201cFollowing Mr. Diaz\u2019s public comments on Thursday we can confirm that he has not been sanctioned or provisionally suspended by USADA. As the independent administrator of the UFC Anti-Doping program, USADA always provides every athlete the presumption of innocence. If the athlete publicly speaks of a potential violation first, then USADA may choose to comment.\u201d the statement read.\n\nUltimately, Campbell believes that while the timing of the situation was unfortunate on multiple levels, at the end of the day, the UFC wants to do right by Diaz.\n\n\u201cYour legacy is what you do this for at the end of the day,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThe money is great and everything else is great, but you do this for your legacy and I don\u2019t want us to ever be a part of anything that negatively affects someone\u2019s legacy who did something unintentionally who did nothing wrong. Nate did nothing wrong. Nate is not a cheater. It\u2019s literally that simple.\u201d", "description": "Quite simply, the company believes Diaz has shown without a doubt that he didn't do anything wrong.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "John Morgan", "Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/nate-diaz-ufc-244-press-conference.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
