Meanwhile, one of the poorest parts of D.C., a section city officials call Far Northeast and Southeast, now has 15,760 units and would get an additional 490 under the mayor\u2019s plan.\n\nOfficials did not detail how they would meet those goals, including what kind of housing would be needed, how it would be created and what it would cost taxpayers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about where you are putting it,\u201d said Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), whose Northwest district would see some of the sharpest increases in affordable housing under the mayor\u2019s plan. \u201cIf we decided to do what\u2019s sensible to have this largely around transit and it doesn\u2019t threaten the single-family homes, then I think you\u2019ll have support. But if on the other hand it overcomes single-family residences, you\u2019ll get a lot of pushback.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome advocates have urged eliminating single-family zoning in American cities as a way to increase housing supply. But critics say that would change the character of neighborhoods, drive out some residents and harm real estate values and the related tax base.\n\nThe Bowser administration also released changes to the city\u2019s 1,600-page comprehensive plan \u2014 a blueprint for development and how the city uses land \u2014 that would affects what kind of housing can be built in different neighborhoods.\n\nChristopher B. Leinberger, professor and chair of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Analysis at George Washington University School of Business, said opposition from residents resisting change in their neighborhoods posed the biggest challenge to the mayor\u2019s proposal.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese are people who are in the top 10 percent of income earners and wealth in our society who are saying, \u2018We got it, you can\u2019t share it,\u2019 \u201d said Leinberger.\n\nAD\n\nSome residents said they resent being labeled as bigots for resisting an influx of affordable housing that could transform their communities.\n\n\u201cI would love to live in Beverly Hills, but I haven\u2019t earned enough money to do so and I\u2019m not asking anyone to give me a voucher or a way in,\u201d said Santiago, a 39-year-old homeowner in Chevy Chase who asked that his last name not be published because of fear of professional repercussions.\n\nHe saved money to buy his house after spending five years in Shaw, in part to escape violence in the gentrifying neighborhood. And he resented the mayor\u2019s recent comments that she would try to make opponents feel \u201cshameful.\u201d Concerns that new housing would bring traffic and crowding in schools are valid, he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want these people, they bring crime, they bring drugs, they bring troubles,\u2019 and it\u2019s not necessarily true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also equally easy to say, \u2018You are just a NIMBY\u2019 [not in my backyard] or \u2018You are a veiled racist or socioeconomic elitist.\u2019 The truth is somewhere in the middle.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBowser took a softer tone Tuesday at a news conference.\n\n\u201cThis is not a way to attack one group of people over the other,\u201d said Bowser. \u201cWill there be tough conversations? For sure. But will we have a fairer and more just city at the end? For sure.\u201d\n\nResidents interviewed Tuesday in neighborhoods west of Rock Creek Park were largely supportive.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are a very isolated, privileged area,\u201d E. Laura Golberg said while strolling through her Friendship Heights neighborhood, where she has lived since 1983.\n\nThe 71-year-old thinks it\u2019s a matter of \u201csimple fairness\u201d for affordable housing to be available in wealthy neighborhoods, especially given a legacy of racism that shut out generations of African Americans and concentrated subsidized housing east of the Anacostia River.\n\nJohn Dinges moved from Mount Pleasant to American University Park in the early \u201990s in pursuit of better schools and a bigger house. He said others deserve the same opportunity.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI grew up in the Midwest and everyone from the poorest to the well-off saw each other all the time, went to church together and sent their kids to the same schools,\u201d said Dinges, a 77-year-old retired journalist, in an interview on his front lawn. \u201cThat\u2019s the formula for a successful society.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe city defines \u201caffordable\u201d housing as costing less than 30 percent of a household\u2019s income, for households earning no more than 80 percent of the Washington area\u2019s median family income. That translates to maximum monthly rent of $2,460 for a three-bedroom unit for a family of four with annual income of less than $97,050, and maximum $1,640 for a studio for a single person earning less than $67,950.\n\nThat said, a large majority of households in subsidized housing earn no more than 60 percent of the region\u2019s median family income. For those households, \u201caffordable\u201d means maximum rent of $1,840 a month for three bedrooms for a family of four earning less than $72,787 a year, and a maximum of $1,230 a month for a studio for a person earning less than $50,962 annually.\n\nAD\n\nDavid Bowers, vice president of Enterprise Community Partners, a national affordable housing organization, described the mayor\u2019s plan as \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d but \u201cdifficult to implement\u201d because of political opposition and cost.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis will be a gut check for our city,\u201d said Bowers, who also is one of the co-conveners of the Housing Leaders Group of Greater Washington, a coalition of affordable housing groups. \u201cThe rubber is going to hit the road in how neighbors respond, how government officials encourage them. The other piece is going to be that dollar amount. How much is this going to cost? At the end of the day, there are going to have to be subsidy dollars.\u201d\n\nThe District\u2019s primary tool for subsidizing affordable housing is the Housing Production Trust Fund, which provides loans and grants to developers to create low-cost housing for eligible residents. The city also issues housing vouchers to help low-income residents pay rent in market-rate housing.\n\nAD\n\nSome areas of the city lack the space for additional development.\n\nAD\n\nThe Capitol Hill area, for example, is slated for 1,400 new units, nearly doubling the existing 1,820 units, under the mayor\u2019s plan. But the area has a large historic district where zoning restrictions make it difficult to add units to buildings. Large-scale projects have also been contentious in an area known for small rowhouses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had enough high-rise condo buildings go up in last couple of years, and they are always controversial,\u201d said Kirsten Oldenburg, an elected neighborhood commissioner in the area who supports the mayor\u2019s targets. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you get 1,400 units without building multiple story buildings \u2026 and we don\u2019t have a lot of land available on Capitol Hill.\u201d", "description": "D.C.
