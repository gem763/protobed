Here are my two main reasons.\n\nI don\u2019t like rewarding investors who make imprudent decisions, and it really galls me to bail out the (mostly) rich people who bought Greek bonds. I don\u2019t like rewarding politicians who make imprudent decisions, and it really galls me since bailouts encourage additional imprudent behavior.\n\nLet\u2019s focus today on the second point.\n\nHere\u2019s Greece\u2019s score for the \u201cSize of Government\u201d component from Economic Freedom of the World. As you can see, bailouts have actually subsidized a decline in fiscal responsibility.\n\nAnd it\u2019s worth pointing out that Greek politicians have been doing a bad job in other areas.\n\nThe burden of red tape has been, and remains, stifling.\n\nGreece ranks at the top in difficulty in setting up and running a business among 75 countries, according to the Global Business Complexity Index for 2019. The difficulty in starting an enterprise in Greece is mainly due to a labyrinth bureaucracy, frequent changes in legislation, differences in taxation and VAT rates in regions and unpredictable treatment of businesses by authorities. Indonesia, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, Bolivia, and Slovakia follow Greece in the first six places. The easiest state to start and run a business is in the Cayman Islands.\n\nHere are the rankings. Keep in mind that \u201c01\u201d is the worst score and \u201c76\u201d is the best score (kudos to the Cayman Islands for being the most entrepreneur-friendly).\n\nInterestingly, voters ousted a left-wing government earlier this year.\n\nAnd Bloomberg reports that Greece\u2019s new right-of-center government intends to reduce the burden of government.\n\nMitsotakis presented his four-year economic agenda in his first plenary speech to parliament since winning national elections on July 7. \u2026The premier\u2019s priority is a reform of Greece\u2019s complex tax system to create a more pro-business environment, necessary for attracting investment to boost the economy\u2019s recovery. Mitsotakis wants to make good on election pledges to alleviate the tax burden for crisis-weary Greeks, specifically for the middle classes who were targeted the most by the previous administration. \u2026Mitsotakis said he will introduce legislation\u2026to reduce the so-called Enfia property tax by as much as 30%, according to the value of properties. \u2026The government plans to reduce the corporate tax rate to 20% in two phases. The first step, in September, will cut the rate to 24% from 28% in 2019 and to 20% in 2020. The tax on dividend payments will be slashed by half to 5%\u2026 Also planned is the privatization of Hellenic Petroleum SA and the sale of a 30% stake in Athens Airport.\n\nIndeed, a columnist for the New York Times frets that the new government is hard right.\n\nNew Democracy\u2026seems to be a right-wing party\u2026 And Mr. Mitsotakis, who promised to unite the country, is following divisive and polarizing policies. \u2026You don\u2019t have to search far for evidence. \u2026Three crucial regulatory agencies \u2014 protecting the country\u2019s finances, work force and environment \u2014 have been effectively dissolved as part of a bill, recently passed by Parliament, to restructure government. \u2026Domna Michailidou, the vice minister of labor, personifies the cabinet\u2019s ideological agenda. In 2017, she openly praised cuts in wages as \u201cnecessary\u201d for the sake of competitiveness. \u2026Greece finished its third and last bailout program last August, but remains shellshocked after nearly a decade of austerity. Official unemployment is at 18 percent; youth unemployment scores a staggering 40 percent. \u2026None of New Democracy\u2019s vaunted policies \u2014 to cut corporation taxes and privatize industry in an effort to stimulate economic growth and create \u201cnew jobs\u201d \u2014 are likely to address the country\u2019s problems. They may well do the opposite.\n\nSome of this sounds good, but I\u2019ll have to see concrete results before I become a believer.\n\nMost supposed right-of-center governments are either very inconsistent (think Trump) or generally bad (think Macri or Sarkozy).\n\nI just focus on results.\n\nSpeaking of which, this chart, based on the OECD\u2019s fiscal database, shows what happened to revenue (left side) and spending (right side) between 2007 and 2018.\n\nAs you can see on the right side, the burden of spending has actually increased. That\u2019s not my idea of austerity.\n\nThe big change that stands out over the past 10 years, though, is that the burden of taxation has jumped. A lot.\n\nIn other words taxpayers have been forced to tighten their belts but politicians haven\u2019t tightened government\u2019s belt.\n\nThe moral of the story is that tax increases always make a bad fiscal situation worse. Greece has proved that over and over and over again.\n\nP.S. I guess bad results should be expected in a nation where bureaucrats demand stool samples before you can set up an online company. Another sign of Greece\u2019s moral and fiscal bankruptcy is that pedophiles can get disability payments.\n\nP.P.S. To offset the grim message of today\u2019s column, let\u2019s also enjoy some Greek-related humor. This cartoon is quite good, but this this one is my favorite. And the final cartoon in this post also has a Greek theme.\n\nWe also have a couple of videos. The first one features a video about\u2026well, I\u2019m not sure, but we\u2019ll call it a European romantic comedy and the second one features a Greek comic pontificating about Germany.\n\nLast but not least, here are some very un-PC maps of how various peoples \u2013 including the Greeks \u2013 view different European nations.", "description": "There are\u00a0many reasons to oppose the various bailouts of the .09/18/2019 19:20:22PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
