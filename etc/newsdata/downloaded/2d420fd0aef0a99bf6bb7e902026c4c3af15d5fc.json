The folks who hang out there will typically deliver some of the most liberal conversations you\u2019d ever care to hear on any subject under the sun. Climate change has been in the news in a big way over the past week, so of course, that was a hot topic.\n\nJoshua Johnson, the host of the 1A show, was recently talking to Justin Worland, a reporter for Time about this subject. There\u2019s really nothing unusual going on here in terms of typical climate alarmism, but the host appeared to have some sort of fixation with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Specifically, he was focused on when Cocaine Mitch might kick the bucket because that\u2019s the only way they think sweeping climate change legislation will be passed. (Free Beacon)\n\nAn NPR show discussed whether or not Democratic voters believe they have to wait until Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) dies to persuade Republican voters to take action on climate change. 1A host Joshua Johnson speculated that Democratic voters think they are \u201cjust going to have to wait for the Mitch McConnells of the Republican Party to die\u201d before persuading GOP voters on climate change. \u201cI know this is kind of a nihilistic question, but I wish I had a nickel for every time I heard a Democratic voter say, \u2018We\u2019re just going to have to wait for the older ones to die off,'\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe know that this current generation is much more pragmatic, much more solutions-oriented. The old folks aren\u2019t going to change, they\u2019re the ones in power.\u201d\n\nIf this all sounds a bit too bizarre to be believed, listen to it for yourself.\n\nNow, to be clear, nobody on the panel was threatening to kill McConnell or even suggesting others do so. (At least not overtly.) And if that phrase had only come up once it wouldn\u2019t be worth mentioning. But Johnson just kept going back to the well. After the first suggestion that they would have to wait for the Majority Leader to die, he invoked the phrase \u201cdie off\u201d before anyone else could get a word in.\n\nThe Time reporter initially seemed to avoid saying it (possibly in a moment of common sense), but then caved. He spoke of it not being \u201ca question of dying out,\u201d going on to repeat that people shouldn\u2019t have to wait for McConnell \u201cand his fellow older Republicans to die off.\u201d\n\nAnother panelist chimed in, saying, \u201cI mean, come on. You\u2019re going to wait for Mitch McConnell to die?\u201d\n\nThere were at least eight references to McConnell and/or other \u201colder\u201d Republicans dying in a very short period of time. Were we in more of a pouncing mode, I suppose we could suggest that this was some sort of veiled threat here that needs to be looked into.\n\nThe broader message they were pushing, death obsession aside, is the belief that there\u2019s a whole generation of younger Republicans out there who are ready and waiting to climb onboard the Green New Deal train, but the tide is being held back by McConnell\u2019s refusal to schedule a vote on Democratic agenda items. Frankly, that doesn\u2019t sound terribly realistic. The majority of conservatives I know aren\u2019t opposed to policies that are beneficial to the planet.\n\nBut when it comes to climate change they largely fall into two groups, including the younger ones. Some are unconvinced that the case has been adequately made that human activity is the main driver of any changes in the climate being observed, with some feeling that the data is being overblown. Others may be convinced that significant climate change is taking place, but are not willing to fund trillion-dollar programs to \u201cdo something about it\u201d when the major polluters and carbon emitters around the globe won\u2019t do their part as well.\n\nEither way, the idea that the GOP is going to radically reform on this issue if Mitch McConnell were suddenly and conveniently out of the way seems a bit far fetched. But at least for now, I suppose the NPR crowd will have to keep waiting to find out. Cocaine Mitch doesn\u2019t appear to be getting ready to give them their wish any time soon.", "description": "Not amused", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mcconnell.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
