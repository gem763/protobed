They\u2019re hoping their experience will mean they can create a group which can forge a genuine career.\n\n(Image: WENN)\n\n\u201cThe groups will also be helped by people who have worked with Little Mix during their careers.\u201d\n\nCowell hopes the new-look Celebrity X-Factor re-boot will win people over after falling ratings and a lack of interest in the last few years.\n\nHe said: \"I think change in any aspect is good.\n\n\"Sometimes you've got to take a break of at least a year, two years, between signing one kind of group and then launching another.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"It's the same with The X Factor . You can't just keep making the same show that it was 14 years ago and expect it to be the same show today.\n\n\"You've got to take a step back for a little while.\"\n\nCowell added: \"It just felt so obvious to do a celebrity version. The only condition was I couldn't know who was going to be on it.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
