Easier said than done, I get it! But a few simple techniques might help you (finally) figure out how to stop drinking soda for good.\n\nReminder: Soft drinks aren\u2019t good for you.\n\nYou already know that soft drinks are, well, not great for you. Okay, it\u2019s pretty bad for you. At least if you want to live a long, kick-ass life.\n\nA recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine on more than 450,000 people from across Europe found that people who consumed two servings of soft drinks per day (diet, included) had a higher risk of dying from any cause compared to those who sipped less than one serving a month. (It\u2019s also been linked with higher risk of stroke, diabetes, and obesity.)\n\n\u201cThe challenge with soft drinks is the quantity of added sugars,\u201d says Brooklyn-based dietitian Maya Feller, author of The Southern Comfort Food Diabetes Cookbook. Often, a serving meets (or exceeds!) the recommendation for your total daily added sugar intake.\n\nYep: 330ml can of cola packs 35 grams of sugar. That\u2019s nearly nine teaspoons of sugar dumped in there. Not to mention that a can of lemon-lime soft drink has 38 grams (nearly 10 teaspoons) of sugar. Whoa. You knew it was sweet, but didn\u2019t know it was that sweet.\n\nBut aren\u2019t diet soft drinks healthier?\n\nBefore you even go there, let me tell you: Diet soft drinks aren\u2019t the answer, either. Diet soft drinks may be sugar-free, but all those artificial, calorie-free sweeteners aren\u2019t exactly good for you, either.\n\n\u201cSome artificial sweeteners are hundreds of times sweeter than table sugar,\u201d says Feller. While they may have less of an effect on your blood sugar, that sweetness overload still makes you crave more sugar, she says. Not exactly the outcome you\u2019re going for.\n\nNot to mention, research has linked consuming artificial sweeteners with an increased risk of stroke, depression, and belly fat. Again, no bueno.\n\nREAD MORE: 5 Mistakes You\u2019re Probably Making If You\u2019re Trying To Cut Down On Sugar\n\nSo what is the best way to stop drinking soft drinks?\n\nReady to give the syrupy-sweet habit the boot? Just follow these dietitian-backed tips.\n\nGo gradual \u2014 not cold turkey. Good news! You don\u2019t have to wake up tomorrow and vow to never have soft drinks again. (That probably wouldn\u2019t work out anyway.) \u201cMaking drastic changes is not an effective way to create sustainable behavioural changes,\u201d says dietitian Mascha Davis, RDN, author of the upcoming book Eat Your Vitamins. Have a plan. It\u2019s one thing to tell yourself you\u2019ll cut back, it\u2019s another to have an exact goal that you can work toward. Let\u2019s say you usually drink two sodas a day. As you get started, keep your two sodas four days a week, but cut down to one the other three days, suggests Davis. \u201cYou won\u2019t feel like this thing you enjoyed so much is being taken away,\u201d she says. Then, reevaluate and adjust. Take a second for a self check-in. How tough was the first step? \u201cMost people say that incrementally decreasing intake is actually an easy switch,\u201d says Davis. Once you feel comfortable with your new soft drink routine, cut down more: have one soft drink four days a week and half a soft drink the other three. Find balance elsewhere. Unfortunately, if you were consuming large amounts of caffeinated soft drinks, you may experience caffeine withdrawal symptoms as you cut back. To diminish the side effects, stay hydrated, eat a balanced diet, exercise, and prioritize at least seven hours of sleep per night. Be patient with your taste buds. Though cutting back on soft drinks may leave you with wicked sugar cravings at first, your taste buds will eventually stop seeking out super sweet flavours, and your desire for soft drinks will wane. \u201cAs you adjust to a lower amount of sugar and sweetness, it becomes easier and easier to have less soda,\u201d says Davis. When this kicks in (it might take a few weeks), commit to drinking just one soft drinks every other day. Never say never. Though you want to cut back on soft drinks so that you don\u2019t rely on it regularly, you don\u2019t have to cut it out completely. \u201cKeep it as an occasional treat,\u201d says Davis.\n\nWhat\u2019s a good drink instead of soft drinks?\n\nDoes the thought of swapping soft drinks for plain water literally make you cringe? Yeah, I don\u2019t blame you. Keep your taste buds occupied by subbing soda out for one of these flavourful, good-for-you drinks.\n\nHerbal tea. If you\u2019re craving soft drinks, go for teas with bolder flavour, like hibiscus or mint, recommends Feller.\n\nSparkling water. If the fizz and flavour are what you love about soft drinks, meet your new love: flavoured sparkling water, says Davis.\n\nKombucha. Davis also gives kombucha, a fermented, fizzy tea, the green light. Since this buzzy drink does naturally contain some sugar (it\u2019s necessary for the fermentation process), read labels carefully and look for a brand that\u2019s lower in sugar.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: Ashley Kirk on Unsplash", "description": "Because who really needs an IV of sugar?", "authors": ["Jessica Migala"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9520/f3f0ecb9f1f94efba9b28f124edbb4fe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
