Fuji. Huge cheers went up for defending champions New Zealand but the biggest, of course, were reserved for hosts Japan.\n\nA choir of children sang the \u201cWorld in Union\u201d theme before former All Blacks captain Richie McCaw raised the Webb Ellis trophy to rousing cheers from the 50,000 capacity crowd.\n\n\u201cThe stage is set ... to make this the best World Cup ever,\u201d World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said.\n\nJapan\u2019s Crown Prince Akishino declared the Sept. 20-Nov. 2 tournament officially open.\n\nThe hosts are kicking off the tournament against Russia on Friday and supporters both local and from overseas turned out overwhelmingly in the red and white jerseys of Japan to root for the home side.\n\nFans squeezed on to trains for the journey to the stadium on the western edge of the city, then drank beer, had their faces painted and sang songs as they walked from the station to the venue. `\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep well and woke up early in the morning. I\u2019m so excited,\u201d said Hiroshi Moriyama, who painted his upper body in the colours of the Japan uniform with the message \u201cWelcome RWC 2019 Japan\u201d on his back.\n\nSetefano Siu Magele and Maia Siu Magele, fans from New Zealand, showed their support for Japan by donning Japan headbands and red T-shirts.\n\n\u201cSo excited, can\u2019t wait.
