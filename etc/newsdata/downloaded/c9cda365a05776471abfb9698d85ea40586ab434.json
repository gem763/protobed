The casino company has been operating in the Chinese territory of Macau since 2002 and now derives most of its income from there. In 2018, Macau accounted for nearly $9 billion, or roughly 63%, of Las Vegas Sands\u2019 revenue.\n\nChinese state media have warned that American companies could pay a price in an unfettered conflict, and some companies, including FedEx Corp. , have already faced setbacks linked to the standoff.\n\nRepresentatives for Mr. Adelson, a major donor to the Republican Party, have also spoken with members of Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, according to this person.\n\nThe White House couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nBefore the phone call with Mr. Trump, Mr. Adelson met the president in person at the White House on Aug. 20.

During the 2018 midterm elections alone he and his wife donated $123 million\u2014more than anyone else\u2014to candidates and conservative causes.\n\nHis company\u2019s license to operate in the Chinese territory of Macau, along with those of U.S. casino operators Wynn Resorts Ltd. and MGM Resorts International , is set to expire in 2022, unless the Macau government grants them renewals.\n\nBefore the phone call with Mr. Trump, Mr. Adelson met Mr. Trump in person at the White House on Aug. 20, in part to reinforce a message from the business community that the tariff and business clash with China has economic repercussions in the U.S., according to two people familiar with the meeting.\n\nAfter that meeting, U.S.-China trade tensions escalated after Beijing said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs on its imports set for Sept. 1. Mr. Trump lashed out on Aug. 23 in a series of tweets, and his administration the same day announced a plan to raise all tariffs on China by 5 percentage points as of Oct. 1.\n\nMr. Trump said that day in a tweet that firms operating in China are \u201chereby ordered\u201d to look for an exit from the market, including by bringing investment back to the U.S. The outburst triggered a market decline, and that evening Mr. Trump touted an emergency-powers law that gives him wide authority to limit business activities overseas.\n\nShipping containers from China and other Asian countries are unloaded in California on Sept. 14.

On Sept. 11, Mr. Trump said he would delay the tariff increase to Oct. 15.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be determined whether Mr. Adelson\u2019s call had any influence on Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to postpone the tariff increase.\n\nThe latest de-escalation, even if temporary, is a relief for businesses that use products traded between the two countries and for U.S. firms worried Beijing will crack down on their Chinese operations.\n\nWrite to Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com, William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com and Kate O\u2019Keeffe at kathryn.okeeffe@wsj.com", "description": "Big Trump donor expressed concerns about how conflict would affect U.S. economy, Trump\u2019s re-election prospects.", "authors": ["Alex Leary", "William Mauldin", "Kate O Keeffe", "Alex.Leary Wsj.Com", "Kathryn.Okeeffe Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109612/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
