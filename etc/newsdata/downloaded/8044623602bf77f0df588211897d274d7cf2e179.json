The official biography of the current leader\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, says he was born on Paektu when a double rainbow filled the skies. State media have occasionally shown Mr Kim, his sister and his father riding white horses. The symbolism goes back to Kim Il-sung, who according to the North\u2019s official narrative rode a white horse while fighting Japanese colonial rulers.\n\nThe latest trip to the peak may precede a major announcement, analysts have suggested, as it has become a favoured place for Mr Kim to visit before revealing policy shifts.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

North Korea walked away from high-level negotiations in Sweden earlier this month with top envoy Kim Myong-gil saying the talks had \u201cnot fulfilled our expectation\u201d.\n\nState media outlet KCNA said Mr Kim also visited nearby construction sites in Samjiyon County and complained about US-led UN sanctions imposed on his country because of its nuclear and missile programmes.\n\n\u201cThe situation of the country is difficult owing to the ceaseless sanctions and pressure by the hostile forces and there are many hardships and trials facing us,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying. \u201cBut our people grew stronger through the trials and found their own way of development and learned how to always win in the face of trials.\u201d\n\nMr Kim said of American sanctions: \u201cWhenever the enemies try to strangle us with the chain of pressure, we should pave the way with our own efforts to continue to live well under the banner of the great spirit of self-reliance so that the enemies feel a pain in their stomach and head.\u201d\n\nPyongyang has faced 11 rounds of sanctions since 2006, with the diplomatic pressure intensifying in 2016 after Mr Kim began conducting a series of high-profile nuclear and missile tests and Mr Trump responded by claiming he would \u201cbring fire and fury\u201d down on the country if they went further. The latest sanctions include a full ban on key exports such as coal, textiles and seafood and a significant curtailing of oil imports.\n\nDuring his second summit with Mr Trump in Vietnam in February, Mr Kim demanded the United States lift the newer sanctions in return for Pyongyang dismantling the country\u2019s main nuclear complex, a limited step. Mr Trump rejected that, and the summit collapsed without reaching any deal. Although there was impromptu meeting at the Korean border in late June where the pair agreed to resume talks before the latest derailment.\n\nThere have been a number of recent short-range missile tests by North Korea, but Mr Trump has sought to play down their significance as he continues to strive for a diplomatic deal that he believes will cement his legacy.\n\nReuters contributed to this report", "description": "He is a world leader whose\u00a0figure does not suggest an over-familiarity with vigorous exercise, but Kim Jong-un\u00a0is used to building up the \u201cmyth\u201d around his family name.
