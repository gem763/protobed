But the tech giant said it decided to strengthen its commitment after developing more programs.\n\nOne such program is the IT Support Professional Certificate .\n\nGoogle is expanding the online course to students enrolled in 100 community colleges _ more than triple the current number _ in 16 select states by the end of 2020 through a $3.5 million grant from JFF , a nonprofit organization that promotes economic advancement.\n\nThe course was released in January 2018 to 30 community colleges in California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Texas, Colorado and Wisconsin. Expansion will place the program in schools in Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Mexico, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nWhile at the Dallas school, Trump and Pichai will solicit feedback from students who have completed the IT support program.\n\n___\n\nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Google is committing to a White House initiative designed to get private companies to expand job training for American workers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Darlene Superville"], "top_image": ""}
