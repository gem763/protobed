Adamson released a statement Friday addressing the controversy.\n\n\"Earlier this month I communicated with a reporter from Time magazine regarding the existence of a photograph showing Justin Trudeau wearing Brownface at an event while he was a teacher at West Point Grey Academy,\" he said in a written statement.\n\nMichael Adamson, left, and his wife, Hisami Kumi Adamson. (Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning)\n\n\"As a past member of the WPGA community, I had been aware of gossip surrounding the existence of this photograph and was in a position to provide a copy of it from the school yearbook to the Time reporter.\"\n\nAdamson said he has never been a member of a political party and received no payment for releasing the image.\n\n\"My decision to provide it to Time magazine was motivated solely by the belief that the Canadian public had a right to see it,\" he said.\n\nAdamson said his written statement will be the only public comment he'll be making on the matter.\n\n\"I ask the media and others to respect my privacy and that of my family.\"\n\nCBC News approached Adamson at his Vancouver home on Friday and Adamson declined to speak further.\n\nWatch: CBC's Eric Rankin tries to interview Michael Adamson, the Vancouver businessman who supplied Time magazine with the Trudeau blackface photo\n\nMichael Adamson tells CBC he has no further comment than what was in his written statement. 0:31\n\nPhoto upended election campaign\n\nWhen Time magazine published its explosive report , it said little about Adamson beyond his connection to the school and how the photo came to his attention.\n\n\"He said that he first saw the photograph in July and felt it should be made public,\" Time reported.\n\nThe report immediately upended the federal election campaign and prompted media organizations, including CBC News, to seek out Adamson for further comment and to learn more about the man. Many details that CBC News has confirmed were first reported by the Globe and Mail on Thursday night.\n\nOver the years, Adamson and his wife have donated thousands of dollars to private schools in the Vancouver area, including West Point Grey Academy, which their son Bennet attended early in his education.\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, Adamson and his wife Kumi Adamson were listed as \"diamond sponsors\" of the West Point gala, online archives show. A diamond sponsor is defined by the school as someone donating $5,000 or more.\n\nIn later years, the couple donated at least $100,000 to another private school, St. George's, from which Bennet graduated in 2015.\n\nBennet is seen in St. George's newsletters and student publications as a member of the school's rowing team, and DJing a school dance.\n\nThe Adamsons also donated thousands of dollars to local charities, including the PALS Autism Society and the Vancouver Public Library.\n\nFred Lee, a Vancouver society columnist and a regular contributor to CBC Vancouver, said Adamson \"is a generous individual who has supported many charities.\"\n\nA source who knows Adamson personally told CBC News that he is \"definitely not a rabid conservative.\"\n\nConnection between Adamson and Time\n\nBennet Adamson appears to be the key link connecting his father with the Time reporter, Anna Purna Kambhampaty, who broke the story.\n\nAdamson and Kambhampaty both attended Cornell University, where Adamson is studying architecture. Kambhampaty graduated in June with a bachelor's degree in information science.\n\nKambhampaty posted a photo of herself holding a giant Toblerone chocolate bar on her Instagram account the same month, thanking Bennet Adamson for giving her a graduation gift.\n\nSince the Time story was published, Kambhampaty deleted her Instagram account, but CBC News was able to get an archived version of the photo.\n\nKambhampaty was a member of the Kappa Delta sorority at Cornell, while Adamson was a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. The two organizations hosted fundraiser events and parties together during the time both were attending the school.\n\nKambhampaty wrote about going to see the band Vampire Weekend perform with her friend Bennet in April, in a column for the Cornell Sun paper. In another section of the same column, she said Bennet is a \"dear friend.\"\n\nMichael and Kumi Adamson in a photo from the Cornell University website in 2017. (Cornell University)\n\nRecords also show Michael and Kumi Adamson fund the \"Adamson Family Cornell Future Architect Award\" and previously donated to the Cornell University College of Architecture, Art and Planning's annual fund .\n\nIn an interview with NPR after the story was released, Kambhampaty said she had heard about the photo \"as a source of gossip in Vancouver community and contacted a source to see the photo and was sent the yearbook.\"\n\nShe added that the gossip was circulating among \"people who had formerly worked there, parents, former parents. It wasn't widely talked about, but a few people were talking about it.\"\n\nComplaints filed to Elections Canada\n\nSince the Time story published, conspiracy theories about how the photo was acquired have circulated online.\n\nSome Twitter users have pointed out that a Michael F. Adamson in Toronto is listed as a donor to the Conservative Party of Canada as well as Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer. However, that's not the right Michael Adamson; the Michael Adamson who supplied the photo's middle initial is R, not F, and he is based in Vancouver, not Toronto.\n\nRT & Share = Thread below exposing the motives of \"Michael Adamson\" who gave the Trudeau picture to Time<a href=\"https://t.co/aHFETpWS9A\">https://t.co/aHFETpWS9A</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cdnpoli</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/elxn43?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#elxn43</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItsOurVote?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ItsOurVote</a> \u2014@gtlem\n\nOthers online questioned whether Adamson even existed, and wondered why the photo was supplied to an American outlet and not a Canadian one. But Adamson's son's relationship with the Time reporter sheds some light on how they may have connected.\n\nConcerns over the story sparked complaints to the Office of the Commissioner of Canada Elections, a spokesperson told CBC News.\n\n\"I can confirm that our office has received complaints, but can't say more beyond that,\" Myriam Croussette, senior communications advisor for the Office of the Commissioner of Canada Elections, wrote in an email. \"There are provisions in the Canada Elections Act that prohibit undue influence by foreigners. However, these provisions include exceptions with regard to the transmission of news to the public through media.\"\n\nSeparately, the Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections Task Force \u2014 which monitors potential foreign interference in the October election campaign \u2014 told CBC News it \"does not have any publicly available assessments to share\" regarding the photo.\n\nThe task force is chaired by the Communications Security Establishment, the country's signals intelligence agency, and includes the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the RCMP and Global Affairs Canada.", "description": "The man who says he sent the infamous blackface photo of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau to Time magazine said he did so\u00a0because the \"Canadian public had a right to see it.\"", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5289171.1568999202!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/justin-trudeau-brownface.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
