The new prime minister has vowed that the departure, known as Brexit, will occur \u2014 \u201cdo or die\u201d \u2014 by the end of October.\n\nThe court\u2019s judgment was a brutal one for the embattled prime minister. The justices asserted that his move to suspend Parliament was a political maneuver and strongly suggested that he might have misled the queen.\n\nJohnson said he will not resign.\n\nBrenda Hale, president of the Supreme Court, eviscerated the government\u2019s case.\n\nSitting in the high court, avoiding legal language and speaking clearly to the country, Hale said that Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament \u201cwas unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201d\n\nThe court unanimously found that Johnson\u2019s suspension was \u201cvoid and of no effect,\u201d meaning, essentially, that Parliament has not been suspended.\n\nJohn Bercow, the flamboyant speaker of the House of Commons, called the high court\u2019s decision \u201cunambiguous\u201d and \u201cunqualified\u201d and said Parliament would resume its duties Wednesday morning.\n\nLawmakers in the House of Commons will be allowed to ask \u201curgent questions\u201d of Johnson\u2019s ministers and take part in \u201cemergency debates\u201d Wednesday, Bercow said, foreshadowing a freewheeling session for the chamber to press the government on all fronts.\n\nSome lawmakers were already discussing a no-confidence measure against Johnson in Parliament, where the prime minister already has lost his majority.\n\n\u201cThis is an absolutely momentous decision,\u201d said Joanna Cherry, a Scottish politician who helped to launch the case in the Scottish courts.\n\nSpeaking immediately after the bombshell decision, Cherry said Johnson and his top aides, who had designed the suspension strategy, \u201cwere not nearly as clever as they think they are.\u201d\n\nShe also called on Johnson to step down. \u201cThe highest court in the United Kingdom has unanimously found that his advice to prorogue this Parliament, his advice given to Her Majesty the Queen, was unlawful. His position is untenable. He should have the guts for once to do the decent thing and resign,\u201d she said.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the court\u2019s decision demonstrates Johnson\u2019s \u201ccontempt for democracy and abuse of power.\u201d\n\nCorbyn said he hoped to make Johnson the shortest-serving prime minister in British history.\n\nIn New York, where he was preparing to address the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday afternoon, Johnson told broadcasters that he \u201cstrongly disagreed\u201d with the court decision but added that he maintained the \u201cutmost respect for our judiciary.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Johnson suggested that the ruling may have been politically motivated.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the E.U.\u201d\n\nJohnson said he would continue to seek an exit deal with Brussels. He doubled down and promised that Britain would leave with or without a withdrawal agreement, even though Parliament has passed \u2014and the queen has signed \u2014 a bill forbidding Johnson from taking Britain out of Europe without a deal.\n\n\n\nAnti-Brexit supporters gather in the rain outside the Supreme Court in London, Sept. 24, 2019. (Frank Augstein/AP)\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling left Johnson with little cover. His move to suspend Parliament was a bold and unprecedented one \u2014 and it backfired in spectacular fashion.\n\nA former prime minister and fellow Conservative, John Major, said he hopes this Supreme Court ruling \u201cwill deter any future prime minister from attempting to shut down Parliament, with the effect of stifling proper scrutiny and debate, when its sitting is so plainly in the national interest.\"\n\nMajor added, \u201dNo prime minister must ever treat the monarch or Parliament in this way again.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m literally speechless,\u201d said Joelle Grogan, a senior lecturer in law at Middlesex University. She said she was watching the judgment in a room full of academics, who were stunned by the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s the rewriting of an unwritten constitution,\u201d she said.\n\nJohnson is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly and to meet with President Trump on Tuesday. Opposition leaders in London said Johnson should return to Britain immediately.\n\nTwo hours after the high court ruling, neither Johnson nor the government spokesman had appeared on camera to respond to the morning\u2019s blockbuster news.\n\nThe ruling followed a three-day hearing last week at the highest court, which was hastily convened to weigh contrasting judgments from English and Scottish courts on Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament until mid-October.\n\nThe high-profile legal case concerns Johnson\u2019s decision to ask Queen Elizabeth II to suspend Parliament from Sept. 10 to Oct. 14, which the prime minister said was needed to introduce his \u201cexciting\u201d new legislative agenda. The queen agreed with the advice of her prime minister, as is customary. But such a suspension traditionally last just four to six days.\n\nJohnson\u2019s critics said that his break \u2014 at five weeks, the longest since 1945 \u2014 was an attempt to thwart lawmakers\u2019 ability to scrutinize the government\u2019s Brexit plans ahead of Britain\u2019s scheduled departure from the bloc on Oct. 31.\n\n[PM vs. PM: John Major argues against Boris Johnson in U.K. Supreme Court case]\n\nAhead of Tuesday\u2019s ruling, Johnson told the Daily Telegraph on Monday that he would not resign if the court ruled against him, insisting that he was correct to suspend Parliament so the government could focus on its domestic agenda. \u201cIt is absolutely absurd to be totally fixated on Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson also threw in a bit of French at one point, one of his rhetorical gimmicks, to say that people should give him a break.\n\n\u201cDonnez-moi un break, is my message to those who say there will be no parliamentary scrutiny. It is absolute nonsense,\u201d he said.\n\nIn court last week, the government\u2019s lawyers said they would abide by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, but they did not rule out suspending Parliament for a second time. Such a move now seems less likely.\n\nLast week, 11 justices on the Supreme Court listened to appeals from two cases with contrasting judgments. A Scottish court found that Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful \u201cbecause it had the purpose of stymying Parliament\u201d ahead of Brexit. An English court dismissed a similar case, saying it was political and not a matter for the courts.\n\nIn court last week, lawyers for the government echoed the English court\u2019s arguments, while lawyers for the claimants posited that the executive should not have unfettered power.\n\nIn one of the more surreal moments, a former Conservative prime minister criticized the current Conservative prime minister over his motives for suspending Parliament. In a written submission, John Major, a pro-European who was prime minister from 1990 to 1997, accused Johnson of being motivated by \u201cpolitical interest.\u201d\n\nThe case was unusual on many fronts, not least because it tested the limits of Britain\u2019s largely uncodified constitution. It is normal for a prime minister to suspend Parliament, but the break is usually measured in days, not weeks.\n\n\u201cThe truth of Brexit is that it\u2019s exposing questions to the courts that they\u2019ve never been exposed to before,\u201d said Grogan, the Middlesex University lecturer. \u201cWe\u2019re now asking them basic questions: What is Parliament? What is government? What is the separation between the two . . . and when there is a clash of law and politics, who gets to make the big decisions?\u201d\n\nShe said before the ruling that the courts were \u201cnavigating strange constitutional waters, with no map.\u201d\n\n[David Cameron says queen agreed to intervene in British politics]\n\nGrogan said that one of the remarkable aspects of the case has been the speed with which it was pulled together. Cases that come before the Supreme Court often take years to weave through the lower courts before they arrive at the highest court in the land, she said. Johnson announced he was suspending Parliament only at the end of August.\n\n\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets with military personnel near Salisbury, England, Thursday, Sept. 19, 2019. (Ben Stansall/AP)\n\nThe majority of lawmakers in Parliament oppose leaving the European Union without a deal, which the government\u2019s own analysis says could impact the supply of medicines and some fresh foods.
