Photo: Courtesy of the retailer\n\nStephanie Danler, whose novel Sweetbitter is now out in paperback, shares her essential skin cream.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I implicitly trust makeup artists. But this makeup artist had the most luminous skin I\u2019d ever seen. When I asked her what her secret was, she responded, \u2018Camellia oil and a little Skin Food around the eyes.\u2019 One of those frustrating answers that means, despite the pink marketing and cutting-edge technology, skin health usually comes down to genetics.\n\nShe pulled out a lime-green toothpaste-shaped tube of Skin Food, and it looked like a mistake. The cream was thick, balmlike, and billed under the product\u2019s website as a treatment for excessively dry or rough skin. \u2018\u201cMy face can be oily,\u2019 I said skeptically, while she nodded. I\u2019m going to look like a flashbulb, I thought, just before she handed me a mirror.\n\nMy skin was flawless, luminous even, and not at all greasy. Weleda Skin Food is an all-purpose, completely natural moisturizer that I now keep in threes: bedside, car, and purse. Nary a chemical in sight, it\u2019s sunflower-seed oil, avocado oil, and pansy extract, and nurtures as it dissolves into your skin.\n\nI\u2019ve used it to heal scrapes and burns while camping; to calm frizzy hair; and to spot-treat cuticles, elbows, and heels. On a recent trip to an arid, high altitude, I slathered it on my face day and night.\n\nAnd while I don\u2019t prime my face with it (I prefer something lighter, see Embryolisse), it has replaced all my shimmery highlighters. \u2018Ugh,\u2019 says my publicist when I tell her what\u2019s responsible for my glow, \u2018someone stole my last tube during a dinner party.\u2019 Yes, Skin Food may inspire your friends to theft, but it\u2019s crime in the name of beauty.\n\nWeleda Skin Food \u00a39 (was \u00a311, now 18% off) \u00a39 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nAnd if you find Skin Food too heavy, might we suggest Skin Food Light?\n\nOther skin-care products we love\n\nNatural Aqua Gel Cure \u2018Through some Amazon sleuthing a few years ago, I stumbled onto something seemingly too good to be true \u2014 a Japanese face peel called Cure Natural Aqua Gel, which is the No. 1 exfoliator in Japan (apparently one sells every 12 seconds). On your dry, post-cleansed face, slather two or three pumps of this jelly over your forehead, nose, cheeks, chin, down the neck, or wherever, and let it sit for five seconds. In an instant, the gel will react with your skin as it begins to dry a bit, at which point, you\u2019ll use your fingers to gently massage the product in a circular motion around your face. This is the wild part. The gel will start to shed almost immediately, much like the way pencil erasers leave those squiggly rubbings behind.\u2019 \u2014 Jinnie Lee.

A313, formerly known as Avibon, is a low-percentage vitamin-A cream. The amount of vitamin A is low enough so that it doesn\u2019t cause the flakiness of typical Retin-A creams, but strong enough that you\u2019ll notice a difference. I\u2019ve used it successfully as a blemish treatment, dotting it on oncoming zits to find them completely gone the next morning. Note: The texture feels like a gluey Vaseline, so be sure to rub it between your hands to spread it evenly over the skin. And people who are allergic to wool, beware \u2014 it does contain lanolin.\u2019 \u2014 Kathleen Hou.
