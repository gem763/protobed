We support ongoing investigations to establish further details.\u201d\n\nIt was a particularly a sharp rebuke of Tehran by three European powers that have been struggling to preserve the Iran nuclear deal (known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA) against enormous pressure from Washington.\n\nThe public calling out of Iran's culpability will also likely further complicate a recent effort by Macron to defuse tensions over the nuclear deal, and even broker a meeting this week between U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nMacron, speaking briefly to reporters after his discussion with Merkel and Johnson, said he remains hopeful, and plans to meet separately with Rouhani on Monday evening and Trump on Tuesday.\n\nHe called the joint statement \"a step that shows that there is clarity,\" and added: \"We are committed, we took our responsibilities by starting in the JCPOA, including when others were leaving it, so we expect that everyone be clear and preserve security in the region.\u201d\n\nTrump has similarly pointed a finger at Iran in the September 14 attack, which caused severe damage at two of Saudi Arabia's most important oil processing facilities and sent world petroleum prices soaring.\n\nIn response to the attack, Trump pronounced his country \"locked and loaded.\" In the end, though, he announced a series of stepped-up sanctions intended to punish Tehran for the attack and further toughen U.S. policy toward Iran, which he had already branded \"maximum pressure.\"\n\nThe Europeans warned sternly that the bombing of the oil facilities had raised the risk of a dangerous new conflict in the Middle East.\n\n\"These attacks may have been against Saudi Arabia but they concern all countries and increase the risk of a major conflict,\" they said. \"We are committed to continuing our diplomatic efforts to create conditions and facilitate dialogue with all relevant partners interested in de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East, in the interest of preserving international peace and security, building upon our joint declaration on July 14, 2019 and G7 conclusions adopted in Biarritz.\"\n\nThey concluded their statement with an appeal to Tehran: \u201cWe urge Iran to engage in such a dialogue and refrain from further provocation and escalation.\"\n\nIranian officials have repeatedly denied involvement in the drone strike, and warned the West against any reprisal. Rouhani has said the attack was a warning to Saudi Arabia from Yemen over the Saudi kingdom's role in Yemen's civil war.\n\nThe joint statement by the Europeans came just hours after the U.K. issued its own assessment of Iran's role.\n\nEarlier on Monday, British Prime Minister Johnson said: \"I can tell you that the U.K. is attributing responsibility with a very high degree of probability to Iran for the Aramco attacks.\" Downing Street said the strikes were conducted using drones and cruise missiles.\n\nEven on his way to New York, Macron had expressed hope that he might still be able to leverage the current situation into an opportunity for renewed diplomacy, and possibly to engage Iran in a conversation not just about returning to compliance with the JCPOA, but also about curbing its role in regional military conflicts and limiting its conventional ballistic missile program.\n\nBut ahead of the summit, Johnson called for a new \u201cTrump deal\u201d on Iran.\n\nIn an interview with NBC, he said the existing nuclear agreement was a \u201cbad deal\u201d with \u201cmany defects\u201d and argued the U.S. president was the \u201cone guy\u201d who could renegotiate it.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s an opportunity now, if everyone can de-escalate for us all \u2014 that\u2019s to say the Europeans, the U.K., plus the United States and others \u2014 to look at a successor to that deal. If it was a bad deal \u2014 and I\u2019m willing to accept that, it had many, many defects \u2014 then let\u2019s do a better deal.\u201d\n\nJohnson continued: \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s one guy who can do a better deal and one guy who understands how to get a difficult partner like Iran over the line and that is the president of the United States.\n\n\u201cSo I hope that there will be a Trump deal, to be totally honest with you.\u201d\n\nA U.K. government official said: \u201cThe Iranians aren't currently in compliance and we need to bring them back into compliance. If there's a way to do that we're open to discussing possible solutions.\u201d\n\nThe appeal to Trump could be a gambit to get the president, who is known for responding to flattery around the negotiating table \u2014 a possibility that might help explain Johnson\u2019s seemingly contradictory joint statement with Macron and Merkel, in which he expressed commitment to the JCPOA.\n\nIndeed, Trump appeared intrigued by the prospect of a new deal in a White House pool clip, saying he was \u201cnot at all surprised that [Johnson] was the first one to come out and say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's why he's a winner,\u201d the president told a White House pool reporter. \u201cThat's why he's a man who\u2019s going to be successful in the U.K.\u201d\n\nTrump added that the existing Iran deal was set to too short a time frame, and that it lacked sufficient inspection rights of Iranian development sites.\n\nIran has pulled back from its commitments under the nuclear deal in response to Trump's unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA and the inability of the European guarantors to maintain the economic benefits that Iran had been promised in exchange for tight controls and monitoring of its nuclear program.\n\nEmilio Casalicchio contributed reporting.", "description": "European guarantors of the Iran nuclear deal issue joint rebuke of Tehran and urge \u2018dialogue.\u2019", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "David M.
