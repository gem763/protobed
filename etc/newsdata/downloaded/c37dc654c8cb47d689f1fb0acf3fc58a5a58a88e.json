I got a phone call from the President of Kenya.\n\n\u201cIt is a great feeling to make history in sport after Sir Roger Bannister,\u201d Kipchoge added in reference to the late Briton\u2019s first sub four-minute mile in 1954. \u201cI am the happiest man in the world to be the first human to run under two hours and I can tell people that no human is limited. I expect more people all over the world to run under two hours after today.\u201d\n\nKipchoge pointed out his mission went beyond athletics.\n\n\u201cWe can make this world a beautiful world and a peaceful world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe positivity of sport. I want to make it a clean sport and an interesting sport.\u201d\n\nKipchoge was cheered by spectators along the course in Prater Park and there were celebrations in his home country before he had even finished.\n\n\u201cHearty congratulations, Eliud Kipchoge,\u201d President Uhuru Kenyatta said in a statement. \u201cYou\u2019ve done it, you\u2019ve made history and made Kenya proud. Your win today will inspire future generations to dream big and aspire to greatness. We celebrate you and wish you God\u2019s blessings.\u201d\n\nHundreds of joyous Kenyans brought traffic to a standstill in the middle of the capital, Nairobi, as they gathered to watch the end of the run on a large screen. People pumped their fists, clapped and fell to their knees as Kipchoge cruised to the finish line.\n\nIn Kenya\u2019s running mecca of Eldoret, called the home of champions, hundreds of people burst on to the streets in celebration.\n\n\u201cWe should line up the entire road from the airport to Nairobi. Receive him like the hero he is,\u201d prominent activist Boniface Mwangi said on Twitter.\n\nStarting at 8:15 a.m., Kipchoge was supported by 36 pacemakers who accompanied him in alternating groups, one of the reasons the IAAF will not ratify the time as a world record.\n\nThe groups were also helped by a pace car with a laser beam, projecting the ideal position on the road, and they received drinks handed over by cyclists and other runners to prevent them from having to slow down.\n\nRunning at an average pace of 2:50 minutes per kilometer (4:33.5 minutes per mile), Kipchoge was 11 seconds ahead of schedule halfway through his run. He then maintained his tempo until the pacemakers left him for the final 500 meters, where he sped up.\n\n\u201cI was really calm, I was just trying to maintain the pace,\u201d said Kipchoge, adding he was never in doubt about breaking the barrier. \u201cFor me it was not 50-50, it was 90 percent.\u201d\n\nJim Ratcliffe, founder of the chemicals company backing the attempt, exchanged high-fives with Kipchoge after the finish.\n\n\u201cHe even accelerated in the final kilometer, he is a super human,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s done it. He did the first half in less than an hour and then he\u2019s just done that again.\u201d\n\nOrganizers said normal anti-doping regulations were in place and that Kipchoge and all the pacemakers were being tested in and out of competition by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU).\n\nThe team behind the event \u201chas ensured all athletes involved in the project are undergoing extensive intelligence-led testing that has been pioneered by the partnership between Abbott World Marathon Majors and the AIU,\u201d they said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Prater Park in the Austrian capital offered long straights, protected from the wind by high trees, for most of the 9.6-kilometer course, which Kipchoge completed more than 4 times.\n\nIt was his second attempt at breaking the two-hour barrier, after missing out by 26 seconds at a similar event on the Formula One track in Monza, Italy, in May 2017.\n\nKipchoge, who took Olympic gold in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and has won 10 of his 11 marathons, holds the official world record of 2:01:39 since shattering the previous best mark by 78 seconds in Berlin last year.\n\nIn near-perfect circumstances at the meticulously planned attempt, Kipchoge shaved almost two minutes off that time.\n\nLong-time coach and mentor, Patrick Sang, a former Olympic and world steeplechase silver medalist, said it was \u201creally exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am happy for him and what he has achieved. He has inspired all of us that we can stretch our limits and that we can do more than we think we can do,\u201d Sang added.\n\nUnder Sang\u2019s guidance, Kipchoge won gold in the 5,000 meters at the world championship in 2003, the start of a distinguished track career which includes Olympic bronze and silver medals from 2004 and 2008.\n\nAfter missing out on qualification for the 2012 London Olympics on the track, Kipchoge switched to the marathon and has since been pushing the boundaries of the discipline.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Tom Odula in Nairobi, Kenya contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "VIENNA (AP) \u2014 Eliud Kipchoge sent shockwaves through the world of sport by becoming the first athlete to break the two-hour barrier for a marathon,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/12/10a85f_austria-hour-marathon-attempt-82805-marathon-runner-eliud-kipchoge-kenya-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
