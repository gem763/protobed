In the latest Morning Consult poll, released Wednesday, she\u2019s up by five percentage points with black voters since August.\n\nThose advances have played a role in her surging overall numbers, which have seen Warren expand her lead over the African-American candidates in the primary \u2014 Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker \u2014 and even overtake Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders in some state and national polls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a dramatic shift that had to be noticed by the Biden campaign \u2014 and also Sanders, Harris and Buttigieg,\u201d said Tim Malloy, Qunnipiac\u2019s polling analyst. \u201cOther [candidates] aren\u2019t moving. And if they are, it\u2019s in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nBiden has long commanded an outsized portion of black voters, many of whom look favorably upon his service as vice president to President Barack Obama. In both the Quinnipiac and Morning Consult polls, Biden holds 40 percent of their support.\n\nWarren, however, has faced doubts about her appeal to the party\u2019s most loyal constituency. But months of outreach and targeted policy proposals appear to have made a mark.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren has been speaking directly to a lot of black women\u2019s issues,\u201d said Avis Jones-DeWeever, a lead researcher on last month\u2019s Essence-Black Women\u2019s Roundtable poll, which has Warren in third place behind Biden and Harris. \u201cI\u2019m seeing those direct specifics that [she\u2019s] looking at and focusing on.\u201d\n\nHer April appearance at the She The People forum \u2014 the first-ever presidential candidate forum focused on women of color \u2014 marked a significant milestone for her campaign, particularly in regards to black women. Following her remarks to a majority-black female audience, the Warren campaign sharpened its messaging to include issues unique to black Americans like maternal mortality rates and racial justice, an approach that some activists say helped alter the perception that Warren was a detached policy wonk.\n\n\u201cIn terms of her building trust and authenticity, I believe that was the moment,\u201d said Aimee Allison, founder and CEO of She The People. \u201cThe thing about [black women] is that we have networks of networks. When she impressed a room of 2,000 women of color, I could just see months later that she started getting people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nSince then, Warren has continued to hold listening sessions with black women\u2019s groups and community activists. Ahead of July\u2019s Netroots Nation conference, one of the largest gatherings of progressive activists, Warren held a roundtable with a group of black organizers who then took to social media to express support for her platform.\n\n\u201cWarren is attempting to rewrite the playbook as it relates to what it takes to win the nomination,\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist based in South Carolina. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how anyone can secure the nomination without overwhelming black support across the board.\u201d\n\nPatrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, pointed to the broadening of Warren\u2019s base \u2014 from white college-educated Northeastern elites to working class people and women of color \u2014 as one of the most significant developments in the race at this point. A majority of Warren\u2019s black supporters are women, who are the most politically active of the bloc.\n\nMurray and other pollsters maintain that Warren\u2019s gains with African-Americans are likely more reflective of Warren\u2019s growing popularity overall, and not necessarily a trend that is unique to black voters.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator is also seeing a rise in support among college-educated white women, going from 25 percent in the August Quinnipiac poll to 37 percent in September.\n\n\u201cMore people are becoming comfortable with her as one of the alternatives [to Biden],\u201d Murray said, also noting that views of her among moderates and conservatives should carry just as much weight as other groups. \u201cShe has a message that she\u2019s a good fighter, regardless of where you are in this race.\u201d", "description": "One element of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s surge in the polls is likely to strike fear in her top Democratic rivals \u2014 her rising support among African-Americans.
