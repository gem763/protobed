In January, she\u2019d had the idea to host a series of \u201ccreativity workshops\u201d for her fans, offering to spend time with them; giving them gifts, some of them handmade; and serving lunch\u2014including that eggplant salad. But the organizational skills required to manage these events overwhelmed her. She ended up canceling most of the workshops, and the ticketing agency Eventbrite refunded everyone. For this, she has become known as an internet scammer, on a par with the men who organized the notorious Fyre Festival. Any time investors or ticket holders are given a prompt, full refund, you are not anywhere near the land of the scam, but the internet didn\u2019t care.\n\nRead: Why people paid thousands of dollars to attend a doomed music festival\n\nAll influencers live on the knife\u2019s edge. To display the details of an appealing life is to gather fans and jealous toads at about a 5-to-1 ratio. Get big enough, and then make a mistake, and the toads will rise up. Female internet rage is not nearly as frightening as male internet rage, which can include threats of extreme violence and sexual harm. But what it lacks in physical threats, it can make up for in intensity. Once it is unleashed on a new victim, all she can really do is lie low and wait it out; although, this is not the way of an Instagrammer, who inevitably prolongs the attack by repeatedly posting about it.\n\nThe venom of Natalie\u2019s essay in no way matches her claims against Caroline, which amount to these: For a short period, Natalie helped edit Caroline\u2019s posts, a service for which she was compensated, and she ghostwrote the book proposal, for which she requested the astronomical fee of 35 percent. For the toads, this news of a ghostwriter was the last straw. Caroline\u2019s creativity workshops had been a scam, and now it seemed that she herself was a fraud.\n\nGrotesquely, two days after the publication of the story in The Cut, the bloated body of Caroline\u2019s mentally ill father was discovered in his home, a possible suicide. He may have been dead for more than a week. Some of the toads announced, in what they seemed to think was a high-minded stance, that they would not discuss the death. Others felt no need to hold back. On the day Caroline announced her father\u2019s death, someone commented on her heartfelt post: \u201cJust fucking deleted your social media. Nobody gives a shit about your [sic].\u201d I started to worry. With a gathering sense of unease, it occurred to me that these bitches might actually kill her.\n\nCaroline Gotschall was born in the middle-class but by no means glamorous suburb of Falls Church, Virginia. \u201cIt, wasn\u2019t one of those REALLY bougie suburbs,\u201d she tells us, \u201cwhere the politicians live, with the sweeping lawns and the azaleas.\u201d Rather, it was more \u201cparking lots and Best Buys and craft stores.\u201d Falls Church is one of those American towns determined to think of itself, in terms both gently self-mocking and obviously self-congratulatory, as a Mayberry R.F.D. kind of place. In Falls Church, the ethos of swim teams and Little League games and Reunion Sundays prevails, and despite profound changes in the racial demographics of the Washington, D.C., metro area, it remains overwhelmingly white. Caroline was the only child of an unhappy mother and a mentally ill father. (Unless otherwise noted, all information about Caroline comes from her Instagram account. I don\u2019t know if it is all the truth, but as we say today, it is \u201cher truth,\u201d and I read it as such.)", "description": "Her Instagram account reads like Brideshead Revisited meets Twilight meets Vanity Fair magazine circa 1988, when greed was good and having money was a golden superpower.", "authors": ["Caitlin Flanagan", "Contributing Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_1147188361/facebook.jpg?1569529531", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
