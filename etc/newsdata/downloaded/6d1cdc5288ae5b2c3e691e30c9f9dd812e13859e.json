Animal Logic has started backing-up its on-premise production content onto Alibaba Cloud\u2019s world-class computing platform. Through this partnership, the parties hope to drive efficiencies of media production by utilising more cloud computing technologies.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s most recognised digital production studios, which has created animation and visual effects for award winning films including Peter Rabbit, The LEGO Movie 2, Captain Marvel and Happy Feet, Animal Logic requires a high-performance cloud storage platform that can quickly scale up for backup requirements, especially during peak production periods, in which 150TB of data can be generated in a 24-hour period. Animal Logic required a partner that could not only provide them with secure data protection capabilities, but also secure backup solutions for the increasingly large amount of data generated within a short period of time.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with Alibaba Cloud will provide us with the best technology to secure our content more efficiently,\u201d says Darin Grant, Animal Logic\u2019s Chief Technology Officer. \u201cWith Alibaba Cloud, we have the capability to backup large amounts of data and in turn, operate seamlessly even during our busiest times.\u201d\n\nAlibaba Cloud, recognised by Gartner as one of the world\u2019s top three cloud computing companies, can meet the demanding requirements set by Animal Logic by providing its first-class storage solutions. To protect storage safety, and enhance the approach to Disaster Recovery, Alibaba Cloud designed a comprehensive storage gateway for Animal Logic and created private networks to minimise disturbance during data transfer. The data during transfer will also be encrypted to enhance the level of security.\n\nAlibaba Cloud and Animal Logic will continue working on future cross-regional storage and backup projects, large scale rendering farm requirements and migration of legacy applications to the cloud. These projects will support Animal Logic\u2019s multi-cloud, whilst retiring a number of critical legacy applications, and ageing on-premise hardware.\n\n\u201cAlibaba Cloud is thrilled to announce our partnership with Animal Logic, in which we will bring increased efficiency and safety to the artists at Animal Logic and in turn, push the boundaries of animation and VFX to a new level,\u201d said Raymond Ma, General Manager for Alibaba Cloud in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAlibaba Cloud\u2019s cross border network covers 20 regions and 61 availability zones globally. It is also the first Cloud provider to fulfil the additional requirements of Germany\u2019s Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalog (C5) and has more than 70 security and compliance accreditations worldwide.\n\nAbout Alibaba Cloud\n\nEstablished in 2009, Alibaba Cloud (www.alibabacloud.com), the data intelligence backbone of Alibaba Group, is among the world\u2019s top three IaaS providers, according to Gartner. It is also the largest provider of public cloud services in China, according to IDC. Alibaba Cloud provides a comprehensive suite of cloud computing services to businesses worldwide, including merchants doing business on Alibaba Group marketplaces, start-ups, corporations and public services. Alibaba Cloud is the official Cloud Services Partner of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nAbout Animal Logic\n\nAnimal Logic is recognised as one of the world\u2019s leading independent creative digital studios, producing award winning design, visual effects and animation for almost 30 years.
