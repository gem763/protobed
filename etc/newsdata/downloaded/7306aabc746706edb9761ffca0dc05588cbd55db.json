To compile the list, the property website found the average loan-to-value and mortgage rate for first-time buyers in 20 towns and cities from banking trade body UK Finance to calculate annual mortgage repayments on a 30 year term. It assumed that 30 per cent of net household income is spent on mortgage costs and the mortgage amount is capped at four times income, as is standard for most lenders. It also assumed that buyers would put in a 15 per cent deposit in regional cities and 25 per cent in London, Oxford and Cambridge. The larger deposits for high value cities allow for the impact of lenders' loan to income limits.\n\nIt isn't all bad news for first-time buyers, particularly those in some southern hotspots where house prices are highest.\n\nThe average household income needed to purchase in the three most expensive cities, London, Oxford and Cambridge, has fallen by an average five per cent since 2016.\n\nIn London an average household income of \u00a384,000 is needed, \u00a33,250 less than the amount needed three years ago.\n\nThis follows years of weak growth and small price falls in the capital, where prices are just now beginning to stabilise.\n\nCambridge and Oxford require the highest incomes of anywhere outside of London, however, the income needed to purchase has also fallen in the university cities by five per cent and three per cent respectively.\n\nAberdeen registered a drop in the level of income required to buy of 12 per cent, the largest percentage decrease all the UK cities, as a result of sharp price decreases in the city since 2015.\n\nThe property market in the city, which is highly dependent on the oil industry, has been hit by declining oil and gas prices\n\nAverage deposit levels have also increased, and again the picture varies across the country.\n\nThe average first-time buyer deposit ranges from \u00a3119,000 in London to \u00a318,449 in Liverpool.\n\nZoopla's Richard Donnell said: 'First-time buyers are an important group accounting for more than one in three sales.\n\n'Affordability remains attractive in many regional cities where house prices have not registered the gains seen in south eastern England.\n\n'We expect prices to continue to increase in cities where housing is in reach of those on average incomes.'\n\nOn a national level house price growth is slowing\n\nThe most recently available figures from the Office for National Statistics and HM Land Registry show that in April the average cost of a home stood at \u00a3229,000, which is \u00a33,000 higher than at the same point a year ago.\n\nAlthough house prices continue to grow, the rate at which they do is slowing on a national level.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said: 'Over the past three years, there has been a general slowdown in UK house price growth, driven mainly by a slowdown in the south and east of England.'\n\nRegional property price shifts, according to figures from HM Land Registry and the ONS\n\nLondon's property market continues to struggle, with prices down by 1.2 per cent year-on-year in April.\n\nThis does mark an improvement on March, however, when prices fell 2.5 per cent compared with March 2018.\n\nDespite the recent slowdown, the average London house still costs \u00a3472,000. On a regional level this is seconded by the South East at \u00a3319,000, and the East of England at \u00a3289,000.\n\nThe North East continued to have the lowest average house price at \u00a3131,000, which means the average cost of a home in this region remains below 2007 levels.\n\nThe ONS report found that in the first-time buyer market, the average cost of a first home has risen by 0.7 per cent in the last month to \u00a3192,559.", "description": "The average first-time buyer needs an average household income of \u00a354,400 to secure a mortgage on their first property, according to data from Zoopla.", "authors": ["Will Kirkman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
