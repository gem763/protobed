Do you think?\u201d\n\nGingrich tried to defend the president with a big helping of whataboutism.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s exactly the same term that [Supreme Court Justice] Clarence Thomas used when he said he was guilty of a white-collar lynching,\u201d Gingrich said before asking Goldberg and the other hosts to put themselves in Trump\u2019s shoes.\n\n\u201cYou got beaten up for over two years with the Mueller thing. You start to relax,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cAll of a sudden, there\u2019s this whole new wave of things, and I think part of what you have is a guy here who\u2019s just really deeply frustrated that no matter where he turns, you know, the fight keeps going on.\u201d\n\nGoldberg then forcefully but politely explained why she has a problem with the president describing his current political situation in terms of a violent hate crime.\n\n\u201cListen, Newt, you and I have known each other a long time,\u201d Goldberg said, \u201cand when a giant 6-foot white guy says, \u2018I\u2019m being lynched here,\u2019 you understand why it\u2019s a little bit like, \u2018Listen, man, you\u2019re not being lynched here, you are being held to the standard we\u2019re supposed to be holding every president to.\u2019\u201d\n\nGingrich started to speak about the lynching of nonblack people, but the hosts steered him back to the question of whether Trump\u2019s language was appropriate. He eventually acknowledged the president \u201coften uses words more clumsily than he should\u201d and suggested that he personally wouldn\u2019t have made a \u201clynching\u201d comment.\n\n\u201cNo, look, I\u2019ve been comfortable just calling it a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 and a \u2018kangaroo court\u2019 and things like that, I haven\u2019t gone up to that next level,\u201d he said.\n\nYou can see the complete segment below.", "description": "\"I\u2019ve been comfortable just calling it a 'witch hunt' and a 'kangaroo court' and things like that,\u201d the former House speaker said on Tuesday's episode.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf4489210000ab21ad3961.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
