First, Brown missed time at training camp after suffering frostbitten feet because of cryotherapy gone bad. Then, he missed time while embroiled in a helmet dispute with the NFL after he was told he couldn't wear his old helmet that no longer met the league's safety guidelines on gear.\n\nAll of this happened while the Raiders were featured on HBO's Hard Knocks this summer, only adding to the media attention they received.\n\nIt's been a rocky road for Brown and the Raiders after the team traded 2019 third- and fifth-round picks to the Pittsburgh Steelers to acquire him. They also reworked his contract, giving him the ability to make up to $54.1 million over the next three years.\n\nGiven Brown's impact on the field\u2014he's a future Hall of Famer who has registered at least 100 receptions, 1,200 receiving yards and eight touchdowns in six straight seasons\u2014it could be money well spent. But off the field, it's come with its fair share of headaches.", "description": "The  Oakland Raiders  fined  Antonio Brown  $13,950 for skipping a mandatory walkthrough Aug. 22, and the wide receiver decided to let everyone know about it on Instagram...", "authors": ["Timothy Rapp"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/826/520/hi-res-cd02e3894076465fa7c2276bb0acd492_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75"}
