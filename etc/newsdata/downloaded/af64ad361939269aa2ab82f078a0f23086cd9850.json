I asked ten of them to share which trends they are most excited about when it comes to finding investment opportunities:\n\nDavid Gardner, Partner at London Venture Partners\n\nHenric Suuronen, Partner at Play Ventures\n\nSamuli Syv\u00e4huoko, Partner at Sisu Game Ventures\n\nJay Chi, Partner at Makers Fund\n\nPeter Levin, Managing Director at Griffin Gaming Partners\n\nGigi Levy-Weiss, Partner at NFX\n\nEthan Kurzweil, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners\n\nJonathan Lai, Partner at Andreessen Horowitz\n\nBlake Robbins, Partner at Ludlow Ventures\n\nJon Goldman, General Partner at GC Tracker & Board Partner at Greycroft Partners\n\nAmid the mix of predictions, there were several common threads, such as optimism about the rise of games as broader social platforms, opportunities to invest directly in new studios, and skepticism about near-term investments in augmented or virtual reality and blockchain.\n\nHere are their responses.\n\nDavid Gardner, Partner at London Venture Partners\n\n\u201cPC Games are back. Great place to start new IP to then migrate a success to multiple platforms. There is more innovation in business models and more open distribution on PC to facilitate audience growth without the punishment of mobile CPIs.\n\nVR & AR remain out. We stood away from VR in the beginning and extend that to AR while the user experience for games remains a disappointment. Let\u2019s hope those new Apple glasses do the trick!\n\nCrypto remain a theological war zone, but honestly everything on offer has been available in the cloud world, but the real consumer benefit isn\u2019t showing up.\n\nWe love games that are expanding audience demographics and are sensitive to less hardcore audiences. For example, women players are estimated to account for 1 billion gamers.\u201d\n\nHenric Suuronen, Partner at Play Ventures\n\n\u201cAt Play Ventures, we believe we have just entered the golden era of mobile gaming. Who would have believed 10 years ago that Nintendo and games like Fortnite and Call of Duty would all be on mobile. Mobile is not just a games platform anymore, it is THE games platform of choice for casual and core players alike. Consequently, in the next 2-3 years we will invest in 30-40 mobile games studios across the globe.\u201d\n\nSamuli Syv\u00e4huoko, Partner at Sisu Game Ventures\n\n\u201cWe at Sisu Game Ventures have been investing in many sectors since 2015 including free-to-play mobile games (especially big here in Finland), VR, AR, PC, console, instant messenger, hypercasual, audio and most recently cloud-native games as well. In addition to game studios, around a third of our investments are into games related tech/infrastructure.\n\nWe\u2019ve so far not dipped our toes into blockchain or eSports and our appetite for doing more investments in VR and AR is nil. To me, the most interesting mega trends lie with the promise of cloud gaming when utilized to its full potential. Another term that encapsulates my excitement is games-as-a-social-hobby. Put this and the extreme accessibility of the cloud together and you\u2019ll have a game with revolutionary potential.\u201d\n\nJay Chi, Partner at Makers Fund\n\n\u201cWe are looking closely at \u2018Gaming as Media\u2019 related content and platforms \u2014 the emergence of new interactive experience centered on \u2018viewers as participants.\u2019 Gaming as social media falls under this thesis. We are also looking for MMO and Metaverse enablers given increased demand for specialized, scalable and affordable technologies that empower lean startup teams to create and operate large-scale worlds and novel gameplays.\n\nWe also see potential for new start-ups to emerge in hypercasual games with midcore/social meta \u2014 no one has truly cracked this genre yet.\u201d", "description": "With cross-platform experiences like Fortnite and PUBG, in-game socializing environments, and subscription-based cloud gaming services from Playstation, Google, Amazon, and others, the gaming industry is entering a new era beyond mobile.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1089096526.jpg?w=600", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
