(Marielle Terhart)\n\nThe roots of the problem can be traced to a multi-billion dollar industry that thrives on self-loathing, Terhart said.\n\n\"There is so much more money to make if we hate our bodies,\" Terhart said.\n\n\"There is way less money to be capitalized on if we just like who we are from the beginning. There is so much effort in media and marketing to basically create one singular type of beauty.\"\n\nAnne Bissonette is an associate professor with the University of Alberta who has researched how bodies and clothes intersect.\n\nShe said standard sizing hasn't changed much since it was created during the Second World War even though women's bodies have.\n\n\"It's really a problematic issue because people have changed. The way we eat has changed, the way we stand has changed. What we consider to be ideals of beauty is getting more diversified but the quote unquote standard hasn't shifted,\" Bissonette said.\n\n\"It is a human right to be able to find clothes that fit you in some way.\"\n\nEthical fashion\n\nTerhart's love for ethical fashion first inspired her to launch her account on Instagram where her fashion magazine-like images have attracted more than 16,000 followers.\n\nBut the love didn't appear to be mutual.\n\n\"I never saw anyone that had remotely close to my body wearing the clothing that I wanted to be investing in,\" said Terhart, who grew out of standard sizing into a size 22 in her early 20s.\n\nShe said brands are slowly expanding their sizing as huge companies demand it. Terhart recently had a chance to experience what a difference that could make.\n\nAs a consultant for an organization that connects women with ethical brands, Terhart was part of an online-plus-sized pop up last summer featuring sizes up to 28. Terhart hosted 13 models at her home for a photo shoot.\n\nInstantly people were comfortable changing in front of each other, sharing items and trying things on.\n\n\"And for me it was just incredibly moving to realize this was an experience I hadn't had in the last decade where I could pull something from my closet and loan it to a friend and it fit them, and it fit them properly, because they were my size,\" Terhart said.\n\nAccording to Bissonnette, many factors contribute to the problem of clothes sizing: Among them, she said, is the fact that manufacturers are reluctant to offer larger sizes that might alienate customers and properly-proportioned clothing requires research.\n\n\"It takes one solid company to think it and do it and prove to others that you can make a ton of money,\" Bisonnette said.\n\n\"Then, you know, money talks.\"", "description": "An Edmonton advocate is calling for fashion and online media to be more inclusive of plus-size women.
