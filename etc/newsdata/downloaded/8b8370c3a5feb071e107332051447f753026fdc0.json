That\u2019s harder to believe.\n\nBy now, we all know better.\n\nAs a candidate, and then as president, Trump has more than allowed this sentiment to flourish. He has instigated and encouraged it.\n\nHe has essentially sided with the Saudi regime after the murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, who wrote columns for The Washington Post.\n\nHe has cozied up to dictators who throw reporters in prison or arrange for their deaths.\n\nHe has repeatedly called the press \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d\n\nAnd he has been pleased to hear the chants of \u201cCNN sucks!\u201d at his rallies. In 2017, he even tweeted another fake video that showed him body slamming someone with a CNN logo for a face during a pro-wrestling match.\n\nAD\n\nThe White House says Trump \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the video.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s pretty late for that.\n\nHere\u2019s what the video looks like, according to a Washington Post article:\n\n\u201cSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) screams as his head is lit on fire. Former president Barack Obama is smashed face-first like a battering ram into what appears to be part of a wooden pulpit. People with their faces replaced by the logos of news organizations such as CNN, NBC, Politico and HuffPost are brutally stabbed and shot.\n\n\u201cAt the center of the bloody rampage unfolding in the \u2018Church of Fake News\u2019 is a man dressed in a dark pinstripe suit. President Trump\u2019s head is superimposed on his body.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s disparagement of the press has infected not only American society but anti-press forces around the world.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that America\u2019s press-freedom ranking is sinking among the nations of the world in a Reporters Without Borders study.\n\nAD\n\nAnd it\u2019s no wonder that Cesar Sayoc \u2014 who pleaded guilty to 65 felony charges after sending pipe bombs to news organizations, including CNN, last year \u2014 described Trump rallies as his \u201cnew found drug.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s initial low-key distancing of the president from this video reminds me of his initial response to last year\u2019s massacre of five staffers of the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis.\n\nHe tweeted \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d and gave a thumbs-up sign and a dismissive wave to reporters asking for his comments.\n\nAD\n\nEventually, he issued a more serious statement, but it felt late, canned and out of sync with what he obviously believes.\n\nPresidential candidate and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke did quite a bit better, immediately responding: \u201cThe video isn\u2019t funny. It will get people killed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA vital part of what makes America great is free speech. So I\u2019m not in favor of yanking threatening T-shirts off the street or punishing people who get their sick pleasure by making horrific memes and videos.\n\nBut I am in favor of looking reality in the face.\n\nThe president of the United States didn\u2019t create this problem, any more than he created the video.\n\nBut, in many, many ways, he has unleashed a vile hatred of journalists that is playing out before our eyes. And it couldn\u2019t be more dangerous.\n\nFor more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan\n\nAD", "description": "A grisly fake video is just the latest example of anti-press rhetoric that the president has encouraged and enabled.", "authors": ["Margaret Sullivan", "Media Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dSJ75DJSuQd4_e9L-4PUEvJwOlY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/URJX4AVLWEI6PBIOFPORENV6LU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
