REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nZURICH (Reuters) - Roche\u2019s (ROG.S) Tecentriq mixed with Avastin helped liver cancer patients live longer, a boost to the Swiss drugmaker\u2019s strategy of expanding its late-to-the-game immunotherapy into niche areas not yet dominated by rivals.\n\nRoche said on Monday it will submit overall and progression-free survival data in hepatocellular carcinoma to U.S., European and Chinese regulators in hopes of a speedy approval. The study compared Tecentriq and Avastin with sorafenib, the generic name for Bayer\u2019s (BAYGn.DE) Nexavar.\n\nTecentriq\u2019s revenue, while growing, pales in comparison to Keytruda (MRK.N) from Merck and Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N), doctors\u2019 go-to immunotherapies for lucrative areas such as non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nBut Roche\u2019s drug is gaining a foothold against smaller targets including triple-negative breast cancer, where it has a head start on its competitors.\n\nThe combination is \u201cthe first treatment in more than a decade to improve overall survival in people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy\u201d, said Levi Garraway, Roche\u2019s new chief medical officer, without disclosing the specific survival benefit for Tecentriq and Avastin.\n\nRoche emphasised the importance of approval in China, where some studies show liver cancer\u2019s prevalence is higher than elsewhere and which may account for 50% of annual new cases globally.\n\nRoche\u2019s Chinese sales have accelerated this year, rising more than 50% through the first three quarters and underpinning the company\u2019s move last week to lift its 2019 outlook again.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Roche to continue its expansion in Asia, and especially in China,\u201d Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said in a note to investors.", "description": "Roche's Tecentriq mixed with Avastin helped liver cancer patients live longer, a boost to the Swiss drugmaker's strategy of expanding its late-to-the-game immunotherapy into niche areas not yet dominated by rivals.", "authors": ["John Miller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443276897&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0HJ", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
