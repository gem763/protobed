REUTERS/Stevo Vasiljevic\n\n\u201cAs I have done elsewhere in my travels in Europe, I also warned of the risks of Chinese investments in sensitive technologies and China\u2019s bribe-heavy strategy to secure infrastructure deals,\u201d Pompeo said after meeting North Macedonian top officials in the southern town of Ohrid.\n\n\u201cWe want North Macedonia to succeed, not struggle with corruption and with debt.\u201d\n\nPompeo began a short trip to two small Balkan countries, Montenegro and North Macedonia, on Friday to discuss their roles in the Western NATO alliance.\n\nAfter meeting top officials Pompeo visited a 9th century Orthodox church, one of the oldest in the region.\n\nChina includes Balkan countries in its \u2018One Belt, One Road\u2019 project to open up trade links for Chinese companies. It has extended loans worth billions of dollars to build railways, roads and power plants, mainly using Chinese workers.\n\nRussia, which has strong ties with some of the countries in the region, openly opposes NATO and EU enlargement to the six Western Balkan states.\n\n\u201cHearts and minds of North Macedonia citizens should guide country forward, not Russian bots and trolls on social media,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve contributed troops to fight alongside ours in both Iraq and Afghanistan; you have contributed to the coalition which has defeated the ISIS caliphate.\n\n\u201cI am confident that the United States Senate will ratify your accession protocol this fall, so that we can formally fold you into the NATO team.\u201d\n\nNorth Macedonia\u2019s attempts to integrate with Western institutions were hampered until it agreed with its neighbor Greece last year on its new name.\n\nGreece had long insisted that \u201cMacedonia,\u201d the name the country chose after the breakup of Yugoslavia, implied a territorial claim on the Greek region of that name.\n\nMILITARY DEAL\n\nFlying in from Rome, Pompeo became the most senior U.S. official to visit Montenegro since 2017 when the country joined NATO. He was set to be the most senior U.S. official to visit North Macedonia since 2001.\n\n\u201cThe United States will continue to partner with you for the good of your citizens, for the region, and for the world,\u201d he said.\n\nPompeo said the United States was about to finalize a deal for \u201c$36 million worth of light tactical vehicles\u201d to Montenegro.\n\nHe commended intelligence cooperation with Montenegro, through which \u201cwe\u2019ve been able to develop a patch against the latest Russian (computer) malware that now protects millions of devices worldwide.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is of strategic importance for Montenegro to have U.S. and EU presence in the Balkans so there would be no space for (influence) of those countries who do not share same values,\u201d Montenegro Prime Minister Dusko Markovic said.\n\nPompeo\u2019s trip to Southern Europe has been overshadowed by an impeachment inquiry in the United States against President Donald Trump.\n\nU.S. Democrats have pushed ahead with the inquiry following revelations by a whistleblower that Trump had asked Ukraine in July to investigate key political rival Senator Joe Biden and his son, and had withheld aid to Ukraine ahead of this request.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nPompeo has yet to comment on evidence presented in the probe on Thursday, in which it was revealed that the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, Kurt Volker, thought it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to withhold military aid from Kiev as it confronted a threat from Russia.\n\nAt the start of a meeting with Montenegrin Prime Minister Dusko Markovic and Darmanovic, Pompeo did not respond to a journalist\u2019s question on whether he thought Volker had acted appropriately in the case.", "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Montenegro and North Macedonia on Friday and warned Balkan leaders of possible risks from Chinese investment in technology and big infrastructure projects.", "authors": ["David Brunnstrom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436984175&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930QV", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
