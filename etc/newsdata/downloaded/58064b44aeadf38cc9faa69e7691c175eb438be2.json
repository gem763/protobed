Rodgers, who came close to ending the club's quest to win the Premier League in 2014, can expect a generous ovation.\n\nFSG appointed Klopp five days after they severed ties with Rodgers. He inherited a team that had been struggling to win at home but the German is adamant that the circumstances around him being appointed did not reflect personally on his predecessor.\n\nBrendan Rodgers returns to Anfield for the first time on Saturday afternoon with Leicester\n\nIn a twist of fate, Rodgers went on to become Klopp's landlord and he says the work the Irishman did at Celtic, where he won seven trophies from a possible seven, plus his reviving of Leicester, prove that his efforts at Liverpool were not a flash in the pan.\n\n'I do not know 100 per cent, but Brendan's quality could not be the reason (he was sacked) because I know how Liverpool were playing before and they were flying,' said Klopp. 'We played them (in August 2014) with Dortmund. We were not in the best shape that day and we lost 4-0.\n\n'They played really well that day and I really respected him as a manager. For the public, when a manager gets the sack, they think he lost his football brain or something. That is not how it happened. Whatever it was I do not know, but it was not his quality as a coach. As easy as that.\n\nJurgen Klopp has defended Rodgers, claiming his managerial ability was never in doubt\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\n'But of course, expectations and relationships, whatever, between who and who, if that does not work anymore the club has to make a decision.

If one day the club has to make a decision that would not say anything about me at that moment.'\n\nRodgers was only 39 when he was appointed in June 2012 - FSG had sounded out Klopp at the same time but he spurned their advances - but Klopp does not think age or a lack of experience stood against him.\n\n'Brendan reached the level he reached - Chelsea assistant, Swansea manager, Liverpool manager - very young,' said Klopp 'Then going to Celtic and being very successful. Going to Leicester just proves what I thought. I am not a bit surprised.\n\n'A lot of boys mid-30 are ready for big things. At Liverpool? I don't know. I have never felt: \"Wow! That is too much and for a younger boy it would be impossible\". Maybe you know more about that. I do not think it has too much to do with your age.'", "description": "Leicester's manager returns to Anfield on Saturday for the first time since Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool's owners, ended his three-and-a-half year reign in October 2015.", "authors": ["Dominic King For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/18/19308522-0-image-a-28_1570210280925.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
