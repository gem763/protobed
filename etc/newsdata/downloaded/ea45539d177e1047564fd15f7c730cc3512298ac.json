I could get the effect I wanted, but it takes some time and care and it doesn\u2019t feel that well-made (sometimes the nib scrolled up or bent during use).\n\n'It\u2019s delightfully minute, though \u2013 great for travel.\u2019\n\nBeauty writer Zoe says: \u2018Love the wand with the tinted gel, as the applicator brush is small and able to coat the hairs without smudging on the skin.\n\n'The pencil end transfers easily \u2013 I\u2019d have liked a thinner tip instead of an angled one, but that\u2019s being picky.\u2019\n\nZoe says: \u2018Inspiration must have been taken from Wunderbrow\u2019s cult brow gel, and this does live up to it.\n\n'I like that there\u2019s six shades, and though I wouldn\u2019t say it lasted completely for 24 hours (and through two face washes), it does definitely go on without budging during the day.\u2019\n\nOctavia says: \u2018I never knew my brows needed fluffing! Instead of having a spoolie like the Unbelieva Brow, this has a fluffing brush, which gives a softening and totally naturalising effect \u2013 the brow equivalent of a good hairbrush.\n\n'If you want your brows to be defined, but not obviously \u201cdone\u201d, this is brilliant.\u2019\n\nZoe says: \u2018The applicator has a stiff, angled end that gives precise lining for the brows, but the thicker brush on the other end isn\u2019t very useful.\n\n'The setting gel and three shades of powder options were good, though.\u2019\n\nZoe says: 'The pen side of this duo takes a little more time to do that my regular pencil because you have to neatly use the thin tip to create fine strokes of hair.\n\n'Once I got used to it, I loved the effect - much more natural than heavy powder. The pencil end was nice too, and lasted ages without rubbing off.'", "description": "From eyebrow pencils to kits and wands (and even one that promises a microblade effect), these new brow innovations will transform your arches in just a few strokes", "authors": ["Zoe Cripps", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16233380.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Beautiful-Happy-Woman-Showing-Love-Sign-Near-Eyes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
