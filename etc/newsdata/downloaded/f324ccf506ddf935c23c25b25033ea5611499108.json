(Think: B2B product manager, diversity and inclusion leader, or freelance beauty writer.)\n\nYour audience: If you're an entrepreneur, this might be your ideal client.

It doesn't need to be a laundry list, just a few of your most eye-catching employers.\n\nKey skills: Here's where you'll get into more detail about what you do.

Briefly mention what you've done in the past, and then, more importantly) highlight how it helps you in your career today.\n\nAdditional skills: Anything else you'd like to mention?
