It meant those reviewing the grades potentially had a vested interest in keeping them the same, so they wouldn\u2019t expose their earlier mistakes.\n\nOne of Britain\u2019s biggest exam boards was ordered to pay a record-breaking \u00a31million this week in fines and compensation after a scandal over re-marking (file image)\n\nLawyers say parents who paid for their child\u2019s paper to be re-marked in the belief the grade was too low could now sue.\n\nMr Williamson said the scandal undermined confidence in the system and he vowed to \u2018put matters right\u2019. He added: \u2018I am absolutely fully supportive of what Ofqual have done.\n\n\u2018It is a real sign that as a regulator they are not going to hold back, they are going to tackle exam boards where they got things wrong and they will be exceptionally robust in doing so, and they have my full backing.\n\n\u2018By them acting in this way it builds more confidence in the system because people have the belief that Ofqual won\u2019t be timid in their actions. I will always be there ready to listen if Ofqual needs more support, more powers, more ability to fine even larger amounts.\u2019\n\nThe penalty for AQA \u2013 a \u00a3350,000 fine and \u00a3735,000 in compensation to schools and exam centres \u2013 is the largest Ofqual has imposed since it was set up in 2010.\n\nPreviously the record fine was to OCR, which last year had to pay \u00a3175,000 after mixing up the Montagues and the Capulets in a GCSE paper on Shakespeare.\n\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson warned exam bosses that he is open to giving regulator Ofqual \u2018more powers\u2019 and the \u2018ability to fine even larger amounts\u2019\n\nCurrently, Ofqual has the power to impose fines of up to ten per cent of an organisation\u2019s annual turnover.\n\nIncreasing those powers further could mean boards in future would face fines of many millions, although a smaller fine is more likely because it is the damage to their reputations which the boards fear most.\n\nMr Williamson said: \u2018For the quality of the exam system, it is so integral for people to have the confidence and belief in terms of what we do for delivering the best education. It\u2019s actually in the interest of the exam boards that we have a robust regulator that isn\u2019t timid about fining them.\n\n\u2018I assure everyone that I will continue to work incredibly closely with Ofqual to make sure that matters are put right. This isn\u2019t acceptable behaviour, it\u2019s not something that we will tolerate. Ofqual have shown that they will take action and that is what they have demonstrated and done.\u2019\n\nOfqual estimated that the AQA scandal affected more than 53,000 exam papers, equivalent to seven per cent of all reviews carried out by the board between 2016 and last year.\n\nThe regulator said there was no evidence pupils got the wrong grades, but added: \u2018The failures have the potential to seriously undermine public confidence in the review of marking.\u2019\n\nMark Bedlow, interim chief executive at AQA, said: \u2018I want to reassure everyone that this past technical issue \u2013 which we\u2019ve fixed now \u2013 didn\u2019t affect the outcome of anyone\u2019s review. Where necessary, grades were still changed.\u2019", "description": "Education Secretary Gavin Williamson warned exam bosses he is willing to give Ofqual 'more powers' to fine after one of Britain's biggest exam boards ordered to pay \u00a31m in fines and compensation.", "authors": ["Eleanor Harding Education Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/22/19857964-0-image-a-20_1571346423367.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
