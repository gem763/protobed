In 2018, 41 cases were brought over illegal abortions, according to a report released by the prosecutor's office.\n\nRaissouni, 28, works for Akhbar al-Youm, an independent newspaper that has been critical of the Moroccan state, and is the niece of a Muslim theologian who is a former leader of a politically influential Islamist group.\n\n190909152602038\n\nRaissouni said police had taken her for medical checks against her will and had asked her about her work at the newspaper and about her uncles.\n\nHer lawyers and rights activists said the checks without her consent amounted to torture.\n\nIn court, the prosecutor dismissed any suggestion of procedural irregularities and said that the circumstances of Raissouni's arrest had been legal and the case had nothing to do with her work as a journalist.\n\nRaissouni and her fiancee had said in court that they had been married in a religious ceremony but had not yet arranged a legal marriage contract.\n\nPolice had said they detained her as she was leaving a clinic they were investigating for abortions.\n\nRaissouni and her doctor said she was there to receive treatment for a blood clot and denied that she had had an abortion.", "description": "Hajar Raissouni's conviction drew widespread criticism, with activists saying charges were an attack on press freedom.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/af92155625bb453b888acc6cf67e2593_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
