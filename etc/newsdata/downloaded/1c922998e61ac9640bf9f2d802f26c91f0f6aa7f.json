Absolutely she could, but we\u2019re intrigued to see where this goes either way, and would love to see her wield a lightsaber in a more official capacity should the opportunity arise.", "description": "Brie Larson has leaned into rumours that she will be involved in an upcoming 'Star Wars' movie, produced by Marvel's Kevin Feige.", "authors": ["Alasdair Duncan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/BrieLarsonStarWarsRumours.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
