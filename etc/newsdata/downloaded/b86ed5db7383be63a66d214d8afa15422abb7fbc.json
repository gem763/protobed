Rabin\u2019s death buried the prospect of peace, further divided an already riven society and left an indelible mark on Israel\u2019s politics.\n\nAlthough the assassination has been the focus of many documentaries, Incitement is the first narrative feature to take on the subject. Directed by Zilberman and co-written with Ron Leshem (Beaufort, Euphoria), it chronicles the events in the year preceding the assassination from Amir\u2019s point of view, and examines the political, religious and personal forces that influenced and motivated him. Extensive archival footage which is, at times, almost seamlessly intercut with reconstructed scenes, relays the progress of the Oslo accords and the violent protests against them, and gives perspective to Israeli politics and society at that time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I want the audience to understand\u2019 \u2026 director Yaron Zilberman.

It shows that Amir, who opposed the accords, was not a loner but sought religious justification and felt emboldened by radical right-wing rabbis. But personal and psychological elements were at play too, including his narcissistic fantasies about being a religious saviour, ethnic and class discrimination, and a mother who believed he was destined for greatness.\n\nThe film has not been without controversy. Following its world premiere at the Toronto film festival, Incitement won best picture at the Ophir awards \u2013 Israel\u2019s Oscars \u2013 and, as a result, will now be Israel\u2019s official 2020 submission to the Academy awards. In response, Israel\u2019s culture minister, Miri Regev claimed that the film \u2013 which received no state funding \u2013 maligned current prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu by suggesting he played a part in the incitement, through its footage of him speaking at a right-wing rally where protesters branded Rabin a \u201ctraitor\u201d, a \u201cmurderer\u201d and a \u201cNazi\u201d for having signed a peace agreement with the Palestinians. The accusation is not new. Netanyahu was head of the Likud party, then in opposition, and he has been repeatedly accused of stoking up hatred and ignoring the inflammatory rhetoric that characterised the political atmosphere leading up to his rival Rabin\u2019s murder.\n\nSpeaking on the phone from Tel Aviv, Zilberman says he had wanted to make a film about Rabin\u2019s murder for more than 20 years. \u201cFor me, it has always been a big wound. But there\u2019s something about how it\u2019s remembered by the nation\u2026\u201d he says, expressing concern that the memory, meaning and significance have somehow been lost. His hope is that Incitement will change the perception of the circumstances surrounding the events. The factors leading to the assassination were not fully investigated at the time, he says, perhaps to avoid a civil war between religious and secular Jews.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Israeli prime minister Yitzahk Rabin and PLO leader Yasser Arafat shake hands for the first time (watched by Bill Clinton) after signing the historic Oslo peace accords in 1993.

Yes, I let him speak but [viewers] hear all the logic, [from all sides] and see that it leads to a murder.\u201d\n\nThe film-makers say they wanted to convey the truth of what happened, to challenge the conspiracy theories that have proliferated since Rabin\u2019s death. \u201cI felt we needed to write this story as is and leave it on a history shelf because, in some parts of Israeli society, people don\u2019t believe that Amir killed Rabin. Or some believe he did, but that he was sent by the left,\u201d says Leshem.\n\nThe film took nearly four years of rigorous research. The film-makers gained access to unpublished psychiatric evaluations of Amir, as well as interviews with the head of the security services and the police investigators, and meetings with Amir\u2019s friends, family and his wife, Larisa Trembovler, and \u2013 most remarkably \u2013 over 100 hours of telephone conversations with Amir himself, from prison. \u201cOur goal was to get the cooperation of the family,\u201d says journalist Amihai Attali, one of the two researchers. As a former correspondent who had covered the West Bank and the Israeli settlements, he was well placed to approach them, he says. \u201cBut no one dreamed that I would talk to Amir personally.\u201d\n\nThe opportunity came via Trembovler. She enabled Attali to make lengthy calls with Amir, using her home phone, two or three times a week, an hour or two at a time. \u201cThe first time I spoke to him, I didn\u2019t believe it had happened. But like anything,\u201d he says, \u201cyou get used to things.\u201d\n\nAmir is serving a life sentence and has little direct contact with anyone in prison or outside. As a result, he dived into their conversations, says Attali. \u201cHe needs to talk to someone, to tell his story and his ideas. He really thinks that he stopped the Oslo process and believes that it would never have happened without him.\u201d But also, by participating in the project, Amir hoped to improve his reputation. \u201cFor most people in Israel, he is the worst person in the world, and so he does whatever he can to [alter this].\u201d\n\nIn his meetings with the family, Attali says he tried to be as non-judgmental as possible. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk with them about whether the assassination was a good thing to have done or not. My mission was to bring the family\u2019s story, not to talk about politics.\u201d Attali says that their conversations did not reveal any information not already disclosed, but details did end up in the film. For example, Amir told a story about when he, his brother Haggai and a friend of theirs, Dror Adani, decided to test a rabbi, Benny Alon, to see if he would join them as their spiritual leader. Amir organised a Shabbat retreat and invited Alon and, during the synagogue service, Amir gave a D\u2019var Torah \u2013 a talk on a topic related to the weekly section of the Torah \u2013 in which he intimated that someone should kill Rabin, in order to see if Alon\u2019s interest was piqued. In the event, Attali says, Alon did not take the bait.\n\nYehuda Nahari Halevi gives a compelling performance as Amir, and portrays the assassin\u2019s radicalisation and fanatical, delusional behaviour with chilling conviction. By coincidence, he is from Neve Amal, the same neighbourhood as Amir, and knew members of Amir\u2019s family, though not the killer himself. Like Amir, he comes from an Orthodox Yemenite family. \u201cBecause I used to be religious, I have the tools \u2013 the mannerisms, body language and the accent. It helped me a lot. But,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s the opposite of who I am now.\u201d\n\nAlmost 25 years have passed since the murder, yet its legacy is still fully present. \u201cSome of the people who were shouting \u2018Death to the PM\u2019 are now sitting as ministers in our parliament,\u201d says Leshem. \u201cYou see crazy things now,\u201d Zilberman says, \u201csuch as Netanyahu trying to close electoral deals to get the support of the extreme religious right, who were [in 1995] at the forefront of the incitement.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, the outcome of Israel\u2019s recent election is yet to be decided. But like many Israelis, Zilberman expresses hope for a change in direction, a leader who \u201cinstead of dividing and inciting, can unite us, raising the level of love and not the level of violence\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Incitement is screening at the London film festival on 12 and 13 October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The makers of a controversial new film about the assassination of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin describe their conversations with the killer, Yigal Amir", "authors": ["Anne Joseph"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b32e56811a387a79519ee4750ea3a914882cd3c/0_317_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=651be19fcd8b3fd27704759524fae33e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
