Add Interest\n\nABC News Live embarked on a 100-mile road trip through the political battleground state this week, talking to dozens of voters -- from downtown Columbus, to the purple suburbs of Westerville, to the Republican-dominant fields of Pataskala.\n\nNearly all of those voters showed openness to the inquiry into President Trump\u2019s conduct with Ukraine, but few expressed a sense of outrage or urgency. In a word, the Ohio voters ABC News spoke with are cautious about impeachment.\n\nABC News\n\n\u201cThe facts and the truth. I want to see where it goes,\u201d Columbus retiree and registered Democrat Judy Miller said. \u201cI would just say continue the investigations.\u201d\n\nAs clear a case as House Democrats might think they have, we found healthy skepticism of the politics surrounding the process; doubts about the ability of news media to fairly present the facts; and concern about the potential impact a successful impeachment vote might have.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s necessarily a good idea or not. I don\u2019t know if it would just cause more chaos,\u201d said a thoughtful 17-year-old high school senior from Pataskala, who will cast a vote for the first time in 2020, and asked not to be named. \u201cI personally don\u2019t think [President Trump] is the best, but I don\u2019t know right now if there would be anybody too much better.\u201d\n\nMany voters who spoke with ABC News seemed genuinely torn: believing it important to enforce norms and uphold principles, but also not seeing a direct stake in the president\u2019s alleged misconduct.\n\nABC News\n\n\u201cI think impeachment is important in one sense of the word, because I think it\u2019s important how our president acts and how he conducts himself. But I also realize that there\u2019s a lot of ways in which information is getting filtered in a bunch of different ways,\u201d said Michael Cole, a middle-aged manager for a truck management solutions company in Columbus.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have time for it. So it\u2019s like white noise in the background,\u201d he said of the daily deluge of scandalous headlines coming out of Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t know who to trust anymore. That\u2019s really the bottom line.\u201d\n\nColin Gardner, an IT specialist and independent voter from Pataskala, chatted as he picked out pumpkins with his wife at Lynd Fruit Farm.\n\n\u201cI feel like regardless of the result of the impeachment, if we don\u2019t have an impeachment inquiry we may have a constitutional crisis,\u201d Gardner said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna have a kid in the next month and I want him to grow up in the kind of place where leaders are held accountable for their actions,\u201d he added, motioning to his wife who is 8 months pregnant with their first child.\n\nABC News\n\nWe also observed near-universal Trump scandal fatigue.\n\n\u201cThere is interest,\u201d said Westerville Mayor Craig Treneff of his constituents\u2019 familiarity with the impeachment push, \u201cbut when I talk to people going door to door, they\u2019re mostly focused on local matters that affect them more directly than the national politics.\u201d\n\nVickie Whaley, a dental hygienist in New Albany, said she thinks it\u2019s all \u201cdirty politics.\u201d \u201cI think that I\u2019d let it just be fought out in the election,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI truly believe they have been trying to impeach this man from day one,\u201d said Todd, a pro-Trump kitchen worker at the Westerville Grill. \u201cThe truth will come out, and I hope that [Trump] prevails.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nFew of the dozens of voters ABC News spoke with could describe even the most basic, key details of President Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukraine now at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nNone could name the president of Ukraine when asked to identify him.\n\nAnna Webber, a special education teacher in Westerville, said she supports an inquiry into Trump\u2019s actions for the message it will send to politicians throughout government. \u201cIf we don\u2019t follow through with this,\u201d she said, \u201cif they\u2019re not accountable to the public and feel they can do whatever they want, that\u2019s very scary.\u201d\n\nMadison Lovell, a 28-year-old nurse in New Albany, said she doesn\u2019t approve of a president asking a foreign government for help investigating a rival, but considers it no worse than other Trump behavior she doesn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m half for Trump because I don\u2019t agree with some of the stuff that he does,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, there\u2019s things I really agree with.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nABC News' Cat McKenzie, Jon Schlosberg, Janet Weinstein and Victoria Moll Ramirez contributed to this report.", "description": "Support for impeachment may be on the rise, but the view from central Ohio is strikingly complicated and nuanced.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/voters-road-trip-01-abc-jef-191016_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
