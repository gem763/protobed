However they had a rocky relationship.\n\nThe court heard \"custody of children and shared ownership of the property caused tension and problems between them\".\n\nThe prosecution claimed Lacomba murdered Ms Wellgreen in a \u201ccalculated manner designed to avoid detection, to leave no trace, and to remove Ms Wellgreen, who is the mother of his three children, from his life forever.\"\n\nLacomba denied murder throughout the trial.\n\nThe taxi driver and Ms Wellgreen had struck up a romance in 2004 after meeting online.\n\nThey enjoyed a long distance relationship before she moved out to Majorca with him. But in 2006, the couple returned to the UK due to financial issues.\n\n(Image: JIM BENNETT)\n\nA year later, Lacomba secured a mortgage on the home, which would become central to the disappearance of Ms Wellgreen.\n\nIt would be in 2014 that the couple split but remained living under the same roof, with Lacomba occupying a bedroom in the loft.\n\nLast year, the house went on the market which led to several disputes. But despite the drama, Ms Wellgreen was optimistic about the future.\n\nShe had secured a new job with a good salary that would \u201callow her to become independent\u201d.\n\nThe last day Ms Wellgreen was seen alive, she took the children to school, accepted the job and told her new employers she was \u201clooking forward to working with them\u201d.\n\nThe court heard the mobile beautician had also been in a \u201cfriendly and chatty\u201d mood when she went to give an elderly client a massage.\n\nBy the time she arrived home for the evening just before 8pm, Lacomba had already been seen on CCTV returning - but had parked in a different place to his usual spot, the jury was told.\n\nMs Wellgreen headed to her bedroom after the children had gone to bed.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nShe exchanged several messages, including one which she sent to her on/off partner Neil James, who asked if she was excited for her new job.\n\nShe replied: \u201cNo not excited. Just feel that a whole weight has been lifted and then that fat t**t says \u2018oh you won\u2019t be able to get benefits for the kids\u2019.\u201d\n\nShe continued, referring to Lacomba: \u201cHe has been very quiet since I have got back. Hmmm, the truth hurts.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cJust want the house to myself now.\u201d\n\nA text to another friend at 9.59pm, believed to be the final one she sent, read: \u201cThere is always something to look forward to, you just need to open your eyes a bit more and dream.\u201d\n\nLacomba told the court he had last seen Ms Wellgreen under the covers in bed, wearing a pink dressing gown while on her laptop.\n\nHowever, Alison Morgan QC, prosecuting, told the court it was \"likely if not inevitable that she was killed within the address.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLacomba told police he was in his bed asleep all night and woke up at 7am to find Ms Wellgreen was not in her bedroom.\n\nThe trial heard that Lacomba's red Vauxhall Zafira was allegedly spotted in the early hours of October 10 at around 2am leaving the address.\n\nIt vanished for two hours before being spotted on CCTV again returning to the property.\n\nBut Lacomba told the court: \"I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s my vehicle as I was home at night.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been me driving that car that night as I was asleep in my bedroom.\u201d\n\nIt later emerged the CCTV outside the property had also been turned off on the night Ms Wellgreen vanished.\n\nLacomba told the court that he accidentally switched it off when trying to charge his phone, something he had \u201csometimes\u201d done before.\n\nBut in trying to claim Lacomba had spun a web of lies, the prosecution alleged a data session was started on one of his phones just before 4.30am in an attempt to delete things off the device.\n\nLater on the morning of October 10, he left at 8.19am for the school run and CCTV \u201cimportantly showed\u201d his taxi to be dirty, despite being clean an hour before he got home the previous evening.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe court also heard he wasn't wearing his normal brown shoes when he went to work at All Night Cars, telling colleagues he had lost them.\n\nHe made no attempts to contact Ms Wellgreen and find out where she was until after 11am, however he told the trial this was because \u201cher door was open and I noticed two phones were in her room.\n\n\"She hasn\u2019t even got her phones with her so how can I contact her?\u201d he said.\n\nAs the day went on, Ms Wellgreen's family began to get increasingly concerned.\n\nOn October 11, Lacomba called 999 at 9.55am to report her missing.\n\nHe told the operator: \u201cHi, I want to report a missing person.\n\n\u201cErrr I know her date of birth is 14.12.71. She hasn\u2019t gone missing before but she has got a bit of a weird lifestyle, let\u2019s put it that way.\n\n\"She lives with me. She is my children\u2019s mum. We\u2019re not together but live together sort of thing.\n\n\"She came home Tuesday night and then we all went to bed but when me and the kids woke up in the morning, she wasn\u2019t there. Her car is still outside.\n\n\u201cI texted her yesterday morning to see if she was alright and stuff but I haven\u2019t had a reply.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked through a phone, like one of them didn\u2019t have a lock on it, to see what was going on sort of thing. And one of them didn\u2019t have a lock on it and I\u2019ve looked through that and I\u2019ve found out that she\u2019s sort of like seeing a few blokes sort of thing. And so it looks like she\u2019s cheating on him sort of thing.\"\n\nLacomba was arrested at 1.55pm on October 16. Throughout the interviews, he answered no comment to all questions asked to him by police.\n\nThen on December 20, 2018, he was charged with murder - despite Ms Wellgreen's body not being found - and continued to deny the allegation.\n\nHe said he was \"shocked\" at his arrest and his solicitor had advised him to stay silent.\n\n\"I felt a level of frustration, the sort of things the police were coming out with were wildly incredible,\" he told the court.\n\n\u201cI wanted to correct them and show them what they were saying wasn\u2019t true, their theories.\n\n\u201cBut my solicitor told me to stay quiet so I followed his advice.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe court also heard that neither of the two phones belonging to Lacomba at the time his ex-partner disappeared have been found by police.\n\nOne, a Samsung Galaxy S8, was initially handed over to detectives but within minutes he demanded it back before any data could be downloaded.\n\nThe prosecution claimed he later told his mother, Marilyn, that he had \u2018chucked it in the river\u2019.\n\nA second phone, a Samsung Galaxy S5, was in use up to 10.35pm on October 14 last year but again has not been traced.\n\nHe told the court there were things on that phone that \"are personal to me and I\u2019d be embarrassed about other people looking through.\"\n\n\u201cI panicked,\" he added.\n\n\"There were things racing through my mind that was on my phone. The two main things were lots of messages that I\u2019d composed in response to a lot of Sarah\u2019s actions and messages that she\u2019d sent me over the years, especially when we were going through the acrimonious court battles.\n\n\"If Sarah\u2019s missing, I didn\u2019t want the police thinking it was me and I could have had anything to do with her disappearance.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cI could potentially be some kind of suspect in their investigation.\"\n\nWhen questioned over a red and grey woman\u2019s pyjama top that was found wet in his shed in a later police search, Lacomba described it as \u201cjust another old rag\u201d.\n\nThroughout the trial he denied murder or having any involvement in Ms Wellgreen's disappearance.\n\nWhen asked in court: \"Where did you put her body?\u201d\n\nLacomba replied: \"I did not\".\n\nUnder cross-examination, the prosecution also challenged Lacomba to point to a map and reveal the location of Ms Wellgreen's body, asking: \"Where\u2019s Sarah?\u201d\n\nA 5ft long shovel found in a garden shed at the home they shared was shown to the jury during the trial too.\n\nLacomba told the court it was a Christmas gift for his mother, but prosecutor Ms Morgan told him it was \"complete nonsense\" he had bought a \"gravedigger's shovel\" as a gift.\n\nShe also described him as an \u201can angry, bitter and controlling man.\u201d\n\nMs Morgan said: \u201cHe wanted custody of his children, in his home on his terms. When it was clear to him that this was not how it was going to be, he was not going to have it.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cHow long he planned for is known only to him.\n\n\u201cOnly he can unlock that secret. The secret of how he killed her and disposed of her body.\u201d\n\nIn her closing statement, Rebecca Trowler, defending, suggested Ms Wellgreen could have walked out of the home and left her life \"behind\", telling jurors there was \"no trace of a killing\" at the home.\n\nAfter the guilty verdict, Detective Chief Inspector Ivan Beasley, from Kent Police, said: \"Sarah had every reason to live \u2013 she had secured a new, better-paid job days before her disappearance, was looking forward to one of her children\u2019s birthdays and was getting into position to buy the family home outright.\n\n\"While we are yet to locate Sarah\u2019s body, it is clear to us that Sarah is no longer alive due to the inactivity of her bank and phone accounts, no contact with friends or family and the fact she left the home without any of her personal items or shown any plans to leave. She didn\u2019t even take her car.\n\n\"But when you look at Ben Lacomba, knowing what we know about Sarah and you begin to prove his account of what happened is untruthful, that he had reason to kill Sarah to avoid being left behind by her, it leaves us with little choice but to conclude he killed her.\n\n\"No other person came to that house that night, Sarah didn\u2019t walk out of there by herself and Lacomba had clearly researched how to leave the area without being seen \u2013 or so he thought.\n\n\"I\u2019m pleased the jury came to the same conclusion.\"", "description": "Beautician Sarah Wellgreen, 46, from New Ash Green, Kent, has not been seen since October 2018 - her ex Ben Lacomba has been found guilty of her murder", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Pa", "Jim Bennett"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13624391.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Sarah-Wellgreen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
