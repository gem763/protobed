Romain Grosjean was sixth for Haas.\n\nBritish-born Thai rookie Alexander Albon seventh in the other Red Bull ahead of Renault\u2019s Nico Hulkenberg and Lando Norris, whose McLaren team had earlier on Saturday confirmed a return to Mercedes engines from 2021.\n\nHaas\u2019s Kevin Magnussen rounded out the top 10.\n\nHome hero Daniil Kvyat\u2019s nightmare weekend continued.\n\nThe only Russian on the grid, the 25-year-old will miss Saturday\u2019s qualifying session after being sidelined by an engine problem in the final practice session.\n\nIt will make little difference, however, with Kvyat set to start last anyway for Honda-powered Toro Rosso.", "description": "Charles Leclerc set the pace ahead of Sebastian Vettel to lead a Ferrari one-two in Saturday\u2019s final practice session for the Russian Formula One Grand Prix.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434854877&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0A3", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
