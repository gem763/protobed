He was the state prosecutor who disposed of the corrupt Schabir Shaik, Zuma\u2019s close friend and benefactor, in a trial that lasted almost a year.\n\nConsensus on the prosecuting team back then \u2013 14 years ago, pre-Facebook, way before Twitter and when Netflix was still delivering VHS tapes via postage \u2013 was that the same set of forensic evidence used to sink Shaik was adequate to send Zuma to Kgosi Mampuru II Prison on Potgieter Street in Pretoria. But politics intervened and Downer has had to cool his heels while Zuma\u2019s famous Stalingrad strategy played out to its fullest extent.\n\nBut Downer\u2019s back in business. The High Court has rejected Zuma\u2019s attempt to escape justice and a date has been set for pre-trial proceedings. There\u2019s no doubt Zuma will try to frustrate the process some more, but his high noon is as close as it\u2019s ever been. News24 specialist reporter Mandy Wiener profiles Downer in this week\u2019s edition, while analyst Mpumelelo Mkhabela considers a \u201cfirm line\u201d that Zuma crossed, and will probably never return to. And I argue the former president\u2019s diminishing was inevitable.\n\nAnd: Up the Boks!\n\nPieter du Toit", "description": "Recent developments have exposed deep seated divisions in the DA on which direction it should take ideologically to renew its legitimacy as an opposition party capable of winning elections.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9487/a461cb190eba4dbf8cee030e1fdd6f4b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
