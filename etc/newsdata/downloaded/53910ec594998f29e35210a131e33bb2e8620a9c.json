Joker. Photo: Warner Bros\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: David Edelstein wrote his initial assessment of Joker at the Toronto Film Festival. This is his full review.\n\nGroundbreaking works are often dangerous, flouting aesthetic and moral norms, forcing you to see the world from angles you\u2019d rather not, through the eyes of people you\u2019d flee. But not all dangerous works are groundbreaking. Not even most of them. Not even many. More often, they\u2019re just sleazy and opportunistic, shocking only in the degree of their violence and not because they show the world from a radical perspective. Consider Joker, the R-rated DC Comics installment that prompted an eight-minute standing ovation after its premiere at the Venice Film Festival. Oh, those Italians \u2014 they do love operatic celebrations of psychosis. I can see why people are gobsmacked. The movie has a distinctively scuzzy look \u2014 harlequin hues plus urban rot \u2014 along with a tour-de-force performance by Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, the pitifully undefended party clown who will one day be Batman\u2019s most feared nemesis. Its director, Todd Phillips, has playfully referred to Joker as \u201cbonkers,\u201d but he\u2019s giving himself too much credit. Righteous vigilantism has long been the dominant mode in modern crime sagas; the main difference here is that the vigilante wears makeup and has a grating laugh. Joker is an attempt to elevate nerdy revenge to the plane of myth, which is scary on a lot of different levels.\n\nAlthough this is an \u201corigin\u201d story, Phoenix\u2019s Arthur is a volatile party clown well before he adopts that fabled moniker. But oh, does he mean well. The problem is that from birth, the fates have cast him as a victim, more sinned against than sinning. What a litany of injuries: In the first scene, a group of teens steals the sign he carries for an everything must go sale and bashes it across his face when he gives chase, after which his boss accuses him of stealing the sign and deducts the cost from Arthur\u2019s wages. An attractive single mother (Zazie Beetz) in his run-down apartment building can barely keep from grimacing in the face of his greasy leering. Social services are being cut, presumably to put money in the pockets of Gotham City\u2019s wealthy \u2014 among them Thomas Wayne, father of Bruce \u2014 which means Arthur no longer has easy access to therapy or meds, which means he could provoke still more scummy thugs with his Tourette\u2019s-like tendency to break into laughter in moments of stress. Sure enough, he\u2019s attacked on the subway, this time by drunken Wall Street guys who happen to work for Wayne. Then a popular talk-show host (Robert De Niro) cruelly ridicules his attempt to be a stand-up comic at an open-mic event. The underclass, the overlords, the bosses, the government, celebrities, his fellow plebes, his overbearing, sickly mother (Frances Conroy) \u2014 everyone knocks him down and down again. Is it any wonder that this bereft, belittled man sees only two possibilities: suicide or supervillainy? In the end, you have to admire Arthur for his self-actualization. It sure beats impotence \u2014 or nonexistence, which is the ultimate impotence.\n\nActually, you don\u2019t just admire Joker. The parade of insults is so repetitive and finally so tedious that you root for his alter ego\u2019s emergence. Kill someone, Arthur! Anyone! Liberate our eyes from those underlit interiors with their pools of red, green, and yellow and from those rusted-out, graffiti-ridden subways and back alleys that conjure up the hell that was New York City in the 1980s. The movie wears its influences like a squirting flower: Arthur is a melding of two Martin Scorsese protagonists, The King of Comedy\u2019s Rupert Pupkin and Taxi Driver\u2019s Travis Bickle (hence the gimmick casting of De Niro), and a cousin to Charles Bronson\u2019s Death Wish vigilante. At no point are we troubled by the people Arthur kills \u2014 they\u2019re \u201cfree-range rude,\u201d in the words of Hannibal Lecter, another psycho transformed by his author into an existential hero after an origin story in which some Nazis forced him to eat his little sister.\n\nJoker is the ultimate Joaquin Phoenix role, which is not necessarily a compliment, though not a disparagement, either. He\u2019s the best unhinged movie actor in the world. Phoenix never seems happier \u2014 or at least more at home \u2014 than when miserably lost in a character\u2019s mind, his features registering every short-circuiting synapse. There\u2019s music in his head, now flowing, now spasmodic, and when Arthur throws up his arms and twirls or does a little soft shoe, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s freeing himself from the oppression of acting sane. Take that, normalcy! When he finally makes an appearance on De Niro\u2019s talk show with his clown face and orange suit, he refuses to connect with the host\u2019s rhythms, and you flash on Phoenix\u2019s nutso act with David Letterman, when he stopped the world and made it squirm.\n\nThe downside to the performance is the downside to the movie: It\u2019s one note played louder and louder. The other actors offer no relief. De Niro is ill-suited to a part that calls for showbiz savvy, Beetz functions as a male projection, and Brett Cullen\u2019s Thomas Wayne would lose a charisma contest to Mike Bloomberg. Conroy has a lyrical moment or two as Arthur\u2019s mom, but she\u2019s so obviously off her rocker that she functions as yet another antagonist to Arthur. The movie comes to life visually \u2014 this time evoking The French Connection \u2014 when the greasepainted Arthur flees detectives by losing himself on a subway packed with protesters dressed as clowns, but I began to dread the inevitable outcome: that Arthur will be recognized as a Clown God in the circus of horrors we call urban life.\n\nAs Time\u2019s Stephanie Zacharek put it, the film is less an exploration of a modern pathology than a symptom of it. It\u2019s an anthem for incels. It brings to mind Stephen Metcalf\u2019s incisive 2012 essay in Slate after a disturbed man opened fire in a theater showing The Dark Knight Rises. Metcalf didn\u2019t blame the movie, exactly. But he did trace a connection between civil massacres and characters like Joker. The young men who had committed such acts believed \u201cthey had been grossly undervalued by the world\u2014so much so, their lives had become one long psychic injury.\u201d Metcalf suggests these men are drawn to supervillains, with their \u201ccharismatic malevolence\u201d and ability to put modern technology to \u201ccreatively annihilative\u201d uses, because it allows them to aggrandize themselves as Mephistophelean. Building on Hannah Arendt\u2019s famous assessment of the Nazi Adolf Eichmann, who represented \u201cthe banality of evil,\u201d Metcalf argued the best way to discourage incidents like the one in that theater (which have become way more frequent in the meantime) is to \u201cdivest evil of its grandiosity or mythic resonance by completely banalizing it.\u201d In other words, make them look like the loser schmucks they are.\n\nAlthough Phillips and the screenwriters sought to make Joker more realistic than its DC Comics predecessors, it exalts its protagonist and gives him the origin story of his dreams, in which killing is a just \u2014 and artful \u2014 response to a malevolently indifferent society. Arthur/Joker might be repulsive, but in a topsy-turvy universe, repulsive is attractive. I\u2019m not arguing that Joker will inspire killings (it might, but so might a lot of other things), only that it panders to selfish, small-minded feelings of resentment. Also it\u2019s profoundly boring \u2014 a one-joke movie.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 30, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
