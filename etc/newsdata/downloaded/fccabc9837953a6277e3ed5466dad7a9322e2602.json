She\u2019s single and lives in Blackburn with her parents and fully grown goats Vincent van Goat and Nigel, both aged two. Camilla (pictured) says:\n\nWhen my late great-grandmother left me \u00a3500, I bought two miniature billy goats. Everyone thought I was bonkers, but I had two as pets when I was a girl and was bereft when they died within a week of each other.\n\nWhen I bought these two \u2014 who I named Vincent Van Goat and Nigel \u2014 as 12-week-old kids, I spent two weeks house-training them before they went to live in a pen in the garden.\n\nCamilla Ainsworth bought two goats after her grandmother left her with \u00a3500. She says her beloved pets Vincent Van Goat and Nigel love to sit in the kitchen while we all eat dinner and have eaten all the vegetable and fruit plants in the garden\n\nNow, they love to sit in the kitchen while we all eat dinner. They also climb on the sofa and anything else they can get their hooves on.\n\nI should only feed them their special dry mix once a day, but they shout if they don\u2019t get a second portion. Mischievously, they\u2019ve eaten all the fruit and veg plants in the garden. They love bread and Nigel guzzles around six bottles of nut milk a week.\n\nA favourite pastime is going on long walks on their leads. In their pink collars and matching coats, they get a lot of attention. With winter on the way, I\u2019ll soon be dusting off their thicker coats, which have fluffy little hoods.\n\nThey even have their own Instagram page. Vincent is smaller, more fun, and cheerful in the morning. He\u2019s a bit of a mummy\u2019s boy, and loves to snuggle up with me on the sofa.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigel is grumpy until he\u2019s had his breakfast and bullies Vincent a bit. Both of them hate it when I wear wellies, and will start butting me if I do. But they\u2019re so comical and I think they\u2019re the perfect pets.\n\nNoisy nannies are very unladylike!\n\nTom Nochi, 44, is a photographer, and lives in Essex with his wife Laura, 40, an operations delivery manager, and their sons (pictured left to right) Yoav, 12, Guy, five, and Oz, nine. They have two pygmy goats called Millie and Bertha. Tom says:\n\nOur pet pygmies \u2014 named after Laura\u2019s late grannies \u2014 might be nanny goats but they\u2019re not ladylike, and burp constantly.\n\nWe bought them four years ago for \u00a3125 each from a farmer at 12 weeks old. He was overrun with kids after his billy goat escaped and impregnated every female in his herd! They\u2019re classed as livestock, so we had to get a Council Parish Holding number from DEFRA.\n\nTom Nochi, 44, lives in Essex with his wife Laura and their sons (pictured left to right) Yoav, 12, Guy, five, and Oz, nine. Their pygmy goats Millie and Bertha after names after Laura's late grannies but are far from ladylike - with both pets being big on burping\n\nLaura was a riding instructor and I worked in a zoo, but it\u2019s still been a learning curve. At first, we kept them indoors, worried they may be tempting to foxes. If any of us crouched down they would climb onto our shoulders. You\u2019d find yourself stuck in a funny position, with a goat nuzzling your face. And, my goodness, they were noisy.\n\nAs they became more robust, we put them into a pen in our 80ft garden, with a shed to sleep in. They love to come into the house for cuddles, but they\u2019re not potty trained so they have to wear baby nappies with a hole for their tails.\n\nHowever, they are escape artists. A man knocked on our door and asked: \u2018Do you have goats?\u2019 When I said yes, he replied: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s nice . . . they\u2019re in my garden!\u2019\n\nThey\u2019d managed to tunnel through and invited themselves round for a graze. Thankfully, he saw the funny side.\n\nThey chased our kittens upstairs\n\nTammy Faulkner, 43, is a teaching assistant and lives near Lincoln. She is single and has five children, Kurtis, 24, Ellis, 19, Imogen, 18, Freya, 13, and Felicity, four. They have two pygmy goats, Eden and Daisy, 16 months old and eight months old respectively. Tammy (pictured with Felicity) says:\n\nEden and Daisy used to live on a petting farm in Bradford, where my daughter Imogen was working ahead of studying veterinary medicine. When the farmer retired, she begged me to let them live here.\n\nTammy Faulkner took on pygmy's Eden and Daisy after the farmer of a petting farm in Bradford begged her to let the animals live with her as they were retiring. She lives with the animals and children Kurtis, 24, Ellis, 19, Imogen, 18, Freya, 13, and Felicity, four (pictured)\n\nI built a pen in our garden and they immediately clawed the fencing down. I\u2019m learning that\u2019s the way goats roll!\n\nAlthough they\u2019re sweet and loving, Eden has sharp horns, so I put foam swimming noodles on them. Our eight-week-old kittens are terrified of them, which Eden and Daisy find hilarious. They\u2019ll sneak inside to chase them, and Eden tried to follow them upstairs.\n\nRecently, they chewed through next door\u2019s fence. My neighbour found them lying on the lawn with her dog.\n\nIf I bend down, they try to knock me over\n\nRachel Horton, 27, is a dog groomer and lives in Wiltshire with husband Nathan, 28, a landscaper. Her pygmy goats, Susie and Steve, are both two. Rachel (pictured) says:\n\nOUR goats are registered with the Pygmy Goat Club and have formal names, Mr Speedy and Mrs Speedy. I bought Steve for \u00a3200 two years ago and Susie a week later. She cost \u00a3250 as females are more valuable.\n\nBecause they\u2019re not classed as domestic pets, goats must be registered with an agricultural vet, and I built a 6ft-high fence around their pen.\n\nRachel Horton, 27, lives with her husband and pygmy goats Mr Speedy and Mrs Speedy. She has built them a climbing frame and treats them to a wash and blow-dry at the local dog-grooming parlour\n\nI also bought a climbing frame, which they love. Steve\u2019s always wanting to rear up and be naughty. Susie\u2019s the boss and struts around. When I let them out, they race for the house, where I follow them with a handheld vacuum to suck up their poo. Much as I love them, they never sleep indoors!\n\nThey love cuddles and crave my attention. If I bend down they try to knock me over or jump on my back.\n\nBut for all their upkeep, Susie and Steve\u2019s guilty pleasure is a wash and blow-dry at my dog-grooming parlour!", "description": "Tom Nochi's pygmy goats wear nappies as they are not potty trained, Camilla Ainsworth's have eaten all the fruit plants in the garden and Tammy Faulkner's have chased the family cats upstairs.", "authors": ["Sadie Nicholas For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/00/19611596-0-image-a-62_1570836005856.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
