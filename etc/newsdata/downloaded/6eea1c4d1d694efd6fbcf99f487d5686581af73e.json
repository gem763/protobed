They tried levitating numerous objects, until they discovered that a basketball worked best and were able to keep it in the air for minutes at a time (right)\n\nThe result, like something out of Harry Potter, shows the ball rotating at speed in mid-air as the brothers manoeuvre it around their garden.\n\nJarrod said: 'I was very satisfied and pleased with the outcome, it was better than we expected.\n\n'It's really awesome that so many people have seen me and my family having fun. I'd like to see what else the leaf blower can do!'\n\nThe pair become so adept at using the leaf blower to control the ball that they're even able to score a slam dunk.\n\nAnd later in the footage, one of the brothers is able to keep the ball floating over the others head before letting it suddenly drop and bounce away.", "description": "Jarrod and Ryan Larsen were experimenting with the powerful device outside their home in\u00a0Benton, Arkansas earlier this year.
