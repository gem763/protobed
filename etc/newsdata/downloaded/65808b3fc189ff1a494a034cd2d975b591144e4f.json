He beat Mike Phillips to an up and under, followed it with a grubber that panicked the Welsh, and was dribbling the ball to the tryline until he lost it when James Hook covered him.\n\nBeale won a Rugby World Cup bronze medal at Wales\u2018 expense in 2011 in Auckland, and the next year he scored all of the points against Wales, including the match-winning try with 26 seconds left for Australia to triumph 14-12.\n\nHe replaced Mitchell again to help the Wallabies pull off a mighty defensive effort to beat Wales at Twickenham in a 2015 World Cup pool game, and scored his third try against Wales in a more comfortable win in 2017.\n\n\u201cThey got us last year,\u201d he says on Wednesday. Indeed, that was his first loss to Wales in eight matches.\n\nBeale is sure to receive a lot of ball coming down on him, more than Fiji gave him last Saturday in the Wallabies\u2019 tournament-opening comeback win in Sapporo.\n\n\u201cWe are well aware of (Dan Biggar\u2019s expected aerial assault),\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of making sure we are prepped, getting through a lot of reps at training.\n\n\u201cIn saying that, Wales have got a really good backline to run the ball, Jonathan Davies, (Leigh) Halfpenny, (Liam) Williams, he\u2019s class. A lot of threats.\u201d\n\nBut he believes defense will decide the likely fate of the winner of Pool D.\n\n\u201cTheir defense has gone up another level (in recent years),\u201d Beale says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a little bit harder to crack. It places more importance on holding on to the ball, building pressure, and hopefully matching them with fitness. It\u2019s always going to go down to the wire. We are prepared for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe World Cup is a different beast, the pressures and intensity,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s the team which handles that.\u201d\n\nBeale is a different beast, too, when he\u2019s facing Wales.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kurtley Beale loves playing Wales.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
