These are the most sacred days to the global Jewish community. Over 10 days \u2013 beginning with Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year) and ending with Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement) we will enter into days of focused repentance.\n\nWhile these Jewish holidays may seem foreign to my Christian friends, I want to invite them to find in these holy days a reason to celebrate three virtues shared by Jews and Christians.\n\nThese virtues are as foundational and inseparable to the Christian faith as they are to our own. One needs only to remember that the Christian Old Testament is our Hebrew Bible, and concepts like repentance, prayer, and charity \u2013 the key themes highlighted throughout these 10 days \u2013 are three values we share, partly because we take them from the same source.\n\nNYPD\u2019S LONGEST SERVING OFFICER, RABBI ALVIN KASS, PROTECTS THOSE WHO SERVE TO PROTECT ALL\n\nWhen these virtues become practices in our daily lives, we will strengthen our relationship with God and our neighbors.\n\nThe first of these pillars is repentance, which is, simply, \u201cgetting right with God.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s so much happening in our modern world that constantly distracts us from God and His love; as a result, we often lose our way. Repentance is about taking a moment to examine our hearts and see the places in our lives where God needs to be invited back in.\n\nIn the Book of Joel we\u2019re told: \u201cReturn to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love\u201d (Joel 2:13).\n\nThis time of the year, we remember that the God who knows every misstep in our lives has a bottomless storehouse of grace and forgiveness for each and every one of us.\n\nWhat Joel is also telling us here is that when we take the first step in getting right with God, He is there waiting for us; and not as an angry judge, but as a gracious Father ready to embrace us and welcome his wayward children home.\n\nThe second pillar is prayer, communing with God.\n\nPrayer is a direct line to our mighty God, and we can feel confident going to Him with any concern. We take this profound concept for granted so often. We disregard its power but it\u2019s quite remarkable when one stops to think about it.\n\nThe very Creator who gave us life and has authority over every living thing in our vast universe actually cares to hear what\u2019s on each and every human\u2019s heart, and He desires for us to constantly and honestly communicate with Him.\n\nKing David came to God with everything: joy and sorrow, anger and thanksgiving, praises and concerns. And so can we.\n\nAs my Christian friends often say, we can \u201ccome boldly\u201d to God\u2019s throne in times of need. What an awesome God we serve that we can come to Him with both the big and the little things! I hope you will be bold with God today, because He is ready to listen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe third pillar is charity, giving back to God.\n\nWhen you get right with God, it creates a thankful heart for all He\u2019s done. And a thankful heart is a generous heart: you want to spread God\u2019s love to others.\n\nSpreading God's love to those in need is what our organization, the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, is all about. We\u2019re blessing God\u2019s children in very tangible ways, like supplying food for families throughout these High Holy Days, mainly because of the generosity of Christians.\n\nThe prophet Isaiah tells us that God isn\u2019t pleased by an outward display of devotion, but by acts of service like feeding the hungry and clothing the naked.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI invite you, Christians (or anyone for that matter), to join me in practicing these three pillars of the High Holy Days \u2013 to get right with God, to come humbly before Him in prayer, and to give generously \u2013 and then to wait and to see how God richly blesses you.\n\nI KNOW that He will.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY YAEL ECKSTEIN", "description": "While the Jewish High Holy Days may seem foreign to my Christian friends, I want to invite them to find in these days a reason to celebrate three virtues shared by Jews and Christians.", "authors": ["Yael Eckstein", "Yael Eckstein Is The President Of The International Fellowship Of Christians", "Jews.
