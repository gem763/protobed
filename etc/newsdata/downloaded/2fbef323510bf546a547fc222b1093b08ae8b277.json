Now, the state\u2019s health authorities are questioning her methods with a four-part complaint, first reported by the Voice of San Diego, accusing her of gross and repeated negligence, failure to maintain records, and unprofessional conduct.\n\nIn 2016, the father of a four-year-old girl sought Zandvliet\u2019s help exempting his daughter from vaccines, according to the state complaint filed this month. The girl, referred to as Patient A, had already received some vaccinations, with none of the adverse effects that the anti-vaccination movement claims can come with immunization.\n\nNevertheless, Patient A\u2019s father sought to exempt her from the shots required for kindergarten enrollment. Zandvliet allegedly sent him a link to her website, which contained a long list of illnesses, allergies, and skin conditions. If A\u2019s father could \u201cfind 4 or more\u201d family members affected by those conditions, \u201cI could make a case that she likely has inherited a tendency to over reactive immune system,\u201d Zandvliet wrote, according to the complaint.\n\nA\u2019s father replied that that his grandmother had experienced asthma and psoriasis, his mother had asthma and adverse reactions to some pain medications, his half-brother \u201chad asthma when he was younger,\u201d and his uncle had \u201casthma, psoriasis, eczema, and allergies to cat dander and dust.\u201d \u201cDo you think that would qualify?\u201d he asked in an email.\n\nZandvliet said it would. A\u2019s father then sent her letters from three of those relatives testifying to their illnesses, and a one-page medical record from his uncle.\n\n\u201cAll of it looks fantastic!\u201d Zandvliet wrote of the documentation. \u201cGood job! I am putting you on the list of qualified and documented.\u201d Later that month, without having met or examined A, Zandvliet wrote an email approving her for a vaccine exemption.\n\n\u201cI certify under penalty of perjury that I have personally examined the pertinent medical records of [Patient A\u2019s] family, and find her qualified per California law SB277 for a medical exemption to vaccines,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIf the decision was dubious in 2016, it would come under even greater scrutiny today. Following media reports, Zandvliet removed a number of familial medical conditions (including psoriasis and asthma) that she used as a basis for A\u2019s vaccine exemption.\n\nThe new Medical Board filing is not a criminal complaint, but she could stand to lose her license. Zandvliet did not return a request for comment on Wednesday. She previously told the Voice that she recommended parents vaccinate their children.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t force them to do anything. But I can recommend it,\u201d she said of vaccination, adding that skipping vaccinations \u201cis a public health risk. It absolutely is. Each school needs to be above 95 percent vaccinated.\u201d\n\nDoctors cite the 95 percent figure as the baseline for establishing \u201cherd immunity\u201d in a community. When 95 percent or more of a population is vaccinated, an illness is unlikely to spread among the remaining 5 percent of people who are not immunized (often infants, the elderly, and people with specific medical conditions that prohibit vaccinations).\n\nDespite medical recommendations, vaccination rates plummeted in California after a 2015 law allowed parents to exempt their children based on their personal beliefs. More than a dozen San Diego kindergarten classes have measles or whooping cough vaccination rates under 95 percent, including one school with a 50 percent measles vaccination rate.\n\nA new state law, effective in 2021, would allow the state to step in when a school\u2019s vaccination rate drops below 95 percent, or when one doctor writes more than five vaccine exemptions in a year.\n\nDespite Zanvliet\u2019s claim to promote vaccines, her conversations with patients include misinformation about immunization, including a myth about aluminum in shots, according to the medical board complaint.\n\nShe also allegedly told parents to \u201cfollow [their] gut\u201d when deciding whether to vaccinate each child, and claimed to have used the same rationale for her own daughter, who was sure she was \u201cgoing to get the flu this year and die\u201d because she\u2019d \u201cfelt it in [her] bones \u2026 that\u2019s a pretty strong gut feeling. So I gave her the shot.\u201d\n\nIn A\u2019s case, vaccines appear to have been a point of contention in the family. A\u2019s parents are divorced, and when the girl\u2019s mother found out about the exemption, she asked Zandvliet whether she\u2019d fabricated her daughter\u2019s medical records. \u201c[I]n terms of falsifying medical documents, it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Zandvliet wrote, according to the medical board complaint. \u201cI have the records direct from the doctor.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t true, the medical board says. The only family medical records she\u2019d received came from the girl\u2019s great-uncle. Those records showed he had psoriasis and dermatitis, which Zandvliet no longer allows as a basis for exemptions.\n\nEventually, after granting the exemption, Zandvliet conducted a brief examination of A, which consisted of watching her play with toys. \"Respondent did not find any evidence in Patient A of an autoimmune condition,\" the complaint alleged.", "description": "Dr. Tara Zandvliet, who has written nearly a third of all vaccine exemptions for children in San Diego schools, is now accused of gross and repeated negligence.", "authors": ["Kelly Weill"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1521,w_2705,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571861731/GettyImages-1135360243_dl10ns", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
