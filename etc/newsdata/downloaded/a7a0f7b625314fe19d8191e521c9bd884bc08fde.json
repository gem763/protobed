He was too angry \u2013 too \u201cseriously pissed off\u201d, in his own words \u2013 to imagine that he could get a good night\u2019s sleep after Inter\u2019s Champions League draw with Slavia Prague, so he went directly from San Siro back to his club\u2019s training ground instead. The only way to work through his frustrations, was to work.\n\n\u201cHead down and keep pedalling.\u201d That was the mantra Conte gave at his introductory Inter press conference in July, and which he has returned to several times since. A little cheesy, for a man who accused his critics of speaking in cliches when they brought up his history of underwhelming European results this week, but you could not accuse him of failing to practice what he preaches.\n\nEuropean roundup: Lukaku seals Milan derby win as Ramsey scores for Juve Read more\n\nConte knew his team would need to pedal especially hard during this congested early section of the fixture list. Inter had four days to prepare for the season\u2019s first Derby della Madonnina. Milan, thanks to their suspension from European competition, were getting the full week.\n\nThe Rossoneri had been given a contrasting mission statement by their new manager, Marco Giampaolo, this summer. Hearing Conte\u2019s plans for the Nerazzurri, he responded that he would tell his players to keep their \u201cheads up and play football\u201d.\n\nOn paper, both men had made encouraging starts. Inter had taken maximum points. Milan had won two out of three.\n\nPerformances, though, were another matter. Inter were grateful to a red card for Rodrigo De Paul for giving them the breathing space they needed to recover from a rough start against Udinese. Milan, across all of their games, had mustered a total of five shots on target. At least Conte\u2019s team seemed to be taking on a measure of his personality.\n\nInter were dreadful against Slavia Prague, yet stole a draw, and almost an injury-time win, through tenaciousness alone. It was hard to identify such clear evidence of Giampaolo\u2019s footballing philosophy at Milan.\n\nHe arrived with a reputation for attacking excellence: the man who helped Fabio Quagliarella to become Serie A\u2019s top scorer at 36 years old. His role in that story might have been overblown. The striker told Dazn last week that Giampaolo had spoken to him \u201cfive or six times in three seasons\u201d.\n\nLess ambiguous was Giampaolo\u2019s preference for a 4-3-1-2. Milan spent the whole summer preparing to play in that formation, only to abandon it after a single game, the manager observing that Krzysztof Piatek was better suited to playing as a lone striker. After watching his No 9 continue to underwhelm in a new system, he flip-flopped back to his original plan on Saturday against Inter.\n\nIt made little difference. Milan were stodgy, and Piatek a peripheral figure, in a derby that never threatened to live up to the choreography that preceded it.\n\nBefore kick-off, fans of the Rossoneri had displayed a gargantuan image of Saint Ambrose \u2013 a fourth-century Bishop of Milan \u2013 stamping on Inter\u2019s serpent in the Curva Sud. \u201cFaith in the devil,\u201d read the accompanying text.\n\n\u201cThe legend gives us a story born of fantasy and imagination, but reality teaches us that even the protector fell into temptation.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Milan\u2019s head coach Marco Giampaolo gives instructions to his players during the derby defeat.

Where Inter could call on the dynamism of two brilliant summer signings, Nicol\u00f2 Barella and Stefano Sensi, Giampaolo had selected only Lucas Biglia, Franck Kessi\u00e9 and Hakan Calhanoglu, with Suso ahead of them in the No 10 role.\n\nIt might as well have been a team picked by Giampaolo\u2019s predecessor, Gennaro Gattuso. At least he would have known better than to believe Suso would have the discipline to occupy Marcelo Brozovic in the defensive phase of the game. The Spaniard started central, but drifted right soon enough, seeking the time on the ball that he craves.\n\nWhere were Milan\u2019s own new signings? Isma\u00ebl Bennacer was named player of the tournament at this summer\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations, while Rade Krunic contributed five goals and seven assists last season for Empoli from midfield. They were signed this summer specifically to address the club\u2019s shortage of creativity, yet they have started only one game between them thus far.\n\nPremier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20 Read more\n\nRafael Le\u00e3o, the one summer addition who did make it into Giampaolo\u2019s derby XI, was their best outfield performer: at least offering moments of invention on the left \u2013 and especially once his fellow new arrival Theo Hern\u00e1ndez joined him on that flank. Besides them, only the goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma emerged with credit.\n\nBrozovic opened the scoring \u2013 from a set piece, rather than open play \u2013 after 49 minutes. Barella then crossed for Romelu Lukaku to make it 2-0 in the 78th. Inter were hardly overwhelming, yet they controlled the game in midfield and took their chances eventually, after a first half in which it seemed like Saint Ambrose himself was at work to thwart his near namesake Danilo D\u2019Ambrosio.\n\nVictory moved Inter back to the top of the table, extending their perfect start. It also allowed for a speedy rapprochement between Brozovic and Lukaku, who celebrated together after reports of a heated argument at half-time during the draw with Slavia Prague. \u201cIf that happens sometimes, I welcome it,\u201d said Conte at full time on Sunday. \u201cIt means that there\u2019s blood running through the veins. I only hope that in future there are fewer news leaks, that would mean we\u2019ve grown.\u201d\n\nBetter to grow from a position of strength. Inter are a long way from the finished article, but they emerge from this season\u2019s first derby with their perfect start intact.\n\nMilan, by contrast, have more questions than answers. Giampaolo asked his team to keep their heads up and play football. His critics are starting to wonder when he will take a look around himself, and acknowledge the more creative options available within his own squad.\n\nTalking points (to follow)", "description": "Antonio Conte\u2019s side won the Milan derby and while he still has much to work on at Inter the San Siro worry lines belong to his Milan counterpart Marco Giampaolo", "authors": ["Nicky Bandini"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c385e8da689c8e2476a86fff1767b6f759ad1472/0_136_3521_2112/master/3521.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a7908649e74be7ca6a344d39b287898b", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
