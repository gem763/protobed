I\u2019ve already written once about some thoughts I have about the confluence of Android, Google, and Microsoft, but there is so much history here that there\u2019s much more to say.\n\nI really can\u2019t get over Microsoft making an Android phone, not after all the angst it went through trying to make Windows Mobile work, then Windows Phone, then buying Nokia, then... alright I won\u2019t get into the whole story here \u2014 because the end of it is that it was Android (not the iPhone) that definitely beat Windows Phone.\n\nAndroid, by the way, only exists because Google\u2019s old CEO Eric Schmidt was worried that Microsoft was going to take over smartphones and become the de-facto alternative to the iPhone.\n\nCommand Line is The Verge\u2019s daily newsletter about personal tech.

I made a Processor video about the whole thing, which was revealed in email evidence from a court case.\n\nNow the tables have been one hundred percent turned, and Android is so dominant that Microsoft had no choice but to adopt it. So it\u2019s making an Android phone \u2014 or will be in 2020, at least. That\u2019s left some calling the Surface Duo vaporware and sure, technically that\u2019s true, but it\u2019s also true that it\u2019s heading out to developers soon \u2014 this thing is coming.\n\nBut just because I believe that Microsoft is definitely committed to getting the Surface Duo out the door doesn\u2019t mean I believe it will definitely be successful. Far from it \u2014 because in order for the Duo to succeed both Microsoft and Google will have to accomplish something that each company has demonstrably spectacularly failed to do several times each in the past decade.\n\nNamely: get developers to make tablet apps.\n\nPetty complaints about the size of the bezels aside, I think the hardware on the Surface Duo looks good. Tom Warren and Nilay sat down with Microsoft\u2019s head of product, Panos Panay, to record a Vergecast episode and also get a second look at the Duo.\n\nHere\u2019s what Tom had to say after spending more time with it:\n\nI got a chance to take a closer look at the Surface Duo this week, and my first impression was simple: it\u2019s so much smaller in person than it appears in photos. I wasn\u2019t allowed to play around with the software on this device, but I was able to slip it into my jeans pocket, and it\u2019s definitely the first pocketable Surface device. It looks and feels like a miniature tablet that\u2019s also a phone.\n\nPanay says that the hardware is locked. So the thing is going to live or die by the software. There are a many places where that can go wrong when you look at the stack. Let\u2019s just enumerate them at a very high level:\n\n1. Can the Android OS handle multiple screens without breaking?\n\nI\u2019m going to go ahead and say yes. Google has been excited to tell me that Android 10 supports multi-screen devices for many months now. I found that excitement mysterious since the only viable device in that category to date has been the Samsung Galaxy Fold \u2014 and until recently it was a total disaster.\n\nNow Google\u2019s excitement makes sense. And some of the features built in to the Fold could actually translate well to the Surface Duo. On the Fold, Android is aware of what\u2019s open on the tiny front screen and can automatically switch and resize it on the big, unfolded inside screen without losing your state. That could roughly translate to ensuring an app on one side of the Duo could resize or move across its two screens.\n\nGoogle has also been working to make Android support resizable windows. On older version of Android, resizing a window literally required restarting the app. That\u2019s not the case anymore \u2014 though apps do need to be updated to support arbitrary resizing. More on that below.\n\n2. Can Microsoft make a customized version of Android that doesn\u2019t suck?\n\nLet\u2019s just take it on faith that Microsoft can pull this off. Normally, the first attempt at an Android skin any manufacturer makes is awful. But Microsoft has been building up to this for some time. It\u2019s been \u201cexperimenting\u201d with Android apps for awhile. Beyond well-made versions of Outlook and Office, it has already distributed a custom launcher and various other apps.\n\nPlus, honestly, the stakes are just too high for Microsoft to screw this up. In the early days of Android, a janky skin from Samsung, LG, or HTC wasn\u2019t enough to sink the phone. Nowadays, it would.\n\nFinally, the entire model of Android is more sophisticated about manufacturer customizations. They\u2019re not \u201cskins\u201d anymore, they\u2019re deeply modularized and sandboxed without forking the OS entirely. Android is designed to make it easy for manufacturers to put their own software in without breaking the core OS.\n\nThe Android OS update situation will never be as good as iOS, but it\u2019s much better than it used to be.\n\n3. Will developers update their apps to make them work elegantly on the Surface Duo?\n\nHere\u2019s where things get dicey. For the Duo to work, the apps on it need to be able to elegantly go from one screen to the other. Or they need to be able to elegantly move from a single screen to spanning across both of them. Microsoft has given itself a little more than a year to get developers onboard to get that work done.\n\nThe problem is that both Microsoft and Google have a terrible track record when it comes to convincing developers to refactor their apps for new form factors, much less new platforms.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Google. I invite you to search for literally any Android tablet review ever and see what the reviewer has said about app support for big screens. If you do, you will find that from the very beginning to now, the universal complaint about Android tablets is that most apps look like blown-up phone apps.\n\nIf Google couldn\u2019t get developers to improve their apps for Android tablets, what are the chances it can get them to update their apps for a weird new dual-screen Surface Duo phone?\n\nThere\u2019s another example of a Google failure to point to, unfortunately: Chrome OS. Android apps on Chrome OS run much better than they get credit for, but that\u2019s not saying much. Too many of them show up in weird, tiny little portrait windows that can\u2019t be resized like normal windows. The same code that makes resizing possible should make them work better on the Surface Duo, but too few support that feature.\n\nAs for Microsoft, there are two failures. The first is maybe unfair to keep bringing up, but here it is: Windows Phone bombed in large part because it didn\u2019t have the apps. It\u2019s unfair because as a distant-third player, the platform was fighting an uphill battle for developer support in the first place.\n\nStill: Windows Phone was a fast, elegant, smart OS and Microsoft poured significant resources into getting developers to support it and failed. The Surface Duo looks like a fast, elegant, smart device too.\n\nThe second failure is the Universal Windows Platform. This one isn\u2019t a total whiff \u2014 there are quality apps in the Microsoft App store. But there aren\u2019t as many as there should be at this point. The very fact that even the very fancy new Surface Pro X and Surface Neo still need to include a solutions for running classic win32 apps tells you everything you need to know.\n\nThis all reads as very dire, like I\u2019m declaring that neither company is up to the task and the Surface Duo will be dead on arrival. I am not, Both companies have learned from their failures and are much better at developer outreach. Making apps that can work across different screen sizes on Android is much easier now, too.\n\nMost importantly, I think both Google and Microsoft are eager to prove that this time they can get it right and they have the resources to make it happen. Every developer who works to make their app resizable on Chrome OS should find that it works better on the Duo as a result \u2014 and vice versa. Plus, frankly, both companies are probably not going to be shy about throwing money at the problem.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a full year before the Surface Duo is available. That\u2019s simultaneously a lot of time and no time at all \u2014 and if Microsoft is smart, it will spend every minute of it convincing Android developers to support its new phone.\n\nMore from Microsoft\n\n+ Microsoft doesn\u2019t think Windows is important anymore\n\nTom has a whip-smart analysis of what\u2019s going on with Windows, one that\u2019s clear on the history of Nadella de-emphasizing Windows. He also unpacks some of that \u201cMicrosoft Graph\u201d stuff that caught my eye:\n\nWindows is still a significant part of Microsoft\u2019s business, but it\u2019s not the future of it. Nadella is signaling that by focusing on the Microsoft Graph, a collection of APIs that connects devices to Microsoft\u2019s cloud services and acts as an important gateway into Windows, Office 365, and Azure. It looks like Microsoft is partnering with Google to connect this Graph deeper into Android.\n\n+ The Surface Pro X and Surface Laptop 3 are upgradable, but only a little\n\nJay Peters talked to iFixit\u2019s Kyle Wiens about Microsoft\u2019s promise to make the new Surface devices more repairable. It\u2019s laudable, but then again it would have been impossible to make them less repairable.\n\nMore from The Verge\n\n+ How this week\u2019s net neutrality ruling can move the fight for an open internet forward\n\nImportant analysis from Adi Robertson. If this ruling hadn\u2019t come during a wild news week of Facebook audio leaks and Microsoft making an Android phone (and, um, impeachment), it would have dominated the news cycle.\n\n+ Ikea Fyrtur smart blinds review: worth the wait\n\nGood review from Thomas Ricker. I remain baffled about why this seemingly obvious product isn\u2019t available, made by a million different companies, and ubiquitous. Something about it must just be really hard to do, I guess?\n\n+ Fire TV might not get Disney+ as Amazon and Disney clash over ads\n\nYou know, when Amazon and Google were engaged in the stupidest and pettiest fight in tech over the past year, I placed the blame equally on Google\u2019s snippy preciousness with YouTube as I did on Amazon\u2019s monopolistic desire to keep FireTV competitors out of its store.\n\nNow, though, Amazon can\u2019t make nice with Disney? For a company that constantly talks about putting the customer first, Amazon sure doesn\u2019t seem to give a damn about providing them with the services they actually want if it means losing marginal revenue somewhere.\n\n+ The next iPhone SE will reportedly look like an iPhone 8, but it\u2019ll be as fast as the iPhone 11\n\nFree advice for Apple: don\u2019t call it an iPhone SE. People who really want a small phone won\u2019t be happy with something the size of an iPhone 8, so don\u2019t antagonize them by using the brand they associate with the last good small phone.\n\n+ JBL Link Bar review: three devices rolled into one average soundbar\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of Jack of All Trades, Master of None?
