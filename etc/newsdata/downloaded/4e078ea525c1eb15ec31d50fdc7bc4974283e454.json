Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), to news breaking that morning that Trump would be pulling American troops out of northern Syria, setting up America\u2019s Kurdish allies for an immediate invasion by neighboring Turkey.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore than half a dozen Republican senators, many of them powerful, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), strongly criticize Trump\u2019s decision. It didn\u2019t immediately translate to any noticeable Republican break in support for the president as he faces an impeachment inquiry, but at the very least, this is another wedge between him and the senators who may soon hold a trial on whether to acquit or convict him.\n\nTUESDAY: Trump stonewalls Congress entirely on impeachment\n\nFirst, the Trump administration blocks a key diplomat from testifying. Fresh off text messages released last week that purported to show Trump\u2019s European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, doing the president\u2019s bidding in Ukraine, Sondland was ready to talk to House investigators behind closed doors. But hours before the scheduled testimony, the Trump administration blocked him \u2014 and confiscated texts and emails on his personal phone that may be relevant to the investigation, said House Democrats. Democrats issued a subpoena. (Sondland now says he\u2019ll comply with that, against State Department directions. He\u2019s set to give a deposition Wednesday, Oct. 16.)\n\nThat evening, the White House issues a letter to House leadership saying it won\u2019t cooperate with the impeachment inquiry at all. The White House counsel accused Democrats of violating \u201cthe Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent.\u201d It was a thin, at times inaccurate and misleading argument. But it formalized what Trump was already doing anyway. Democrats said that won\u2019t halt them \u201cone iota,\u201d but they may now be at the mercy of Trump officials willing to cross the impeachment picket line to testify. Or they could impeach him for obstructing Congress.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, a poll shows that a majority of Americans support the impeachment inquiry. And nearly half, 49 percent, support the House actually impeaching him. The Washington Post-Schar School poll is among those showing an uptick in public support for impeachment, including among some Republicans. Other polls out this week show similar support; at least half of Americans support the impeachment inquiry.\n\nA new memo from the original whistleblower, obtained by the New York Times, says that a White House official who was on Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president described the call as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cfrightening\u201d and \u201ccompletely lacking in substance related to national security.\u201d\n\nWEDNESDAY: Biden backs removing Trump, Pence struggles to answer questions\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden says Trump should be impeached \u201cfor shooting holes in the Constitution.\u201d He had been a notable holdout in the 2020 race on calling for impeachment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Democrats consider subpoenaing White House officials despite Trump\u2019s ban, Trump appears to offer a negotiating chip to them: take a vote putting lawmakers on record for an impeachment inquiry, and he would consider helping out. \u201cWe would if they give us our rights,\u201d he said.\n\nVice President Pence would not give a straight answer about his involvement in Ukraine. Despite Trump\u2019s insistence that the July call at the center of the impeachment inquiry was \u201cperfect,\u201d Pence did not seem to want anything to do with it. He met with Ukraine\u2019s president in September, and when pressed by an NBC News reporter, he did not say what he did or didn\u2019t know about Trump\u2019s attempts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201cIf Pence did not know this was about Biden,\u201d writes The Fix\u2019s Aaron Blake, \u201cyou could certainly argue he was being willfully ignorant.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTHURSDAY: Trump donors with ties to Ukraine are arrested\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman are accused of funneling foreign money to make political donations and help out a Ukrainian official. They had been under investigation at the same time that the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry requested their testimony. The indictment accuses them of trying to donate to a congressman to get a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine ousted (Trump later removed her) and to try to use lawmakers to help them get a marijuana business started. It\u2019s not clear how, if at all, this is connected to Trump\u2019s own efforts in Ukraine. We do know Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, worked with these two men and was, somewhat inexplicably, leading Trump\u2019s efforts in Ukraine. Democrats subpoenaed the two for documents, as well as Energy Secretary Rick Perry.\n\nTrump holds a rally for the first time since the impeachment inquiry. He went to Minnesota, a state narrowly he lost in 2016. There, he lambastes Democrats over the impeachment inquiry (\u201ca brazen attempt to overthrow our government\u201d) and launches vicious personal attacks at both Joe Biden (\u201dnever considered smart\") and his son Hunter Biden (\u201ca loser\u201d).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFRIDAY: Strategizing for the next big week\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, testifies behind closed doors, despite the White House\u2019s objections to administration officials cooperating with the impeachment inquiry. Yovanovitch tells House investigators that Trump had her ousted over concerns she was loyal to the Bidens, despite being a career diplomat -- an allegation she denies. She also questions, in prepared remarks, whether her focus on anti-corruption could have jeopardized some of Giuliani\u2019s clients in Ukraine.\n\nThat testimony caps what might turn out to be a slow week relative to the one that comes next, when the full House and Senate return to Washington.\n\nFriday afternoon, both sides are plotting how they\u2019ll adjust their strategies given the avalanche of developments over the two weeks they\u2019ve been on recess. House Democrats are wondering if the Ukraine-focused strategy they had settled on doesn\u2019t go far enough. \u201cWe have an obligation to just see how deep this sewage flows,\" one of them told The Post.\n\nAD", "description": "From news of a second whistleblower all the way to the arrest of two Trump donors with ties to Ukraine.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VxNZ4y8HhM8BefXlDz-K_idNV4A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JG4NSJL43NFKZF7Q3W5WM4AKWU", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
