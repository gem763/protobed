Many Chinese vaccine makers have failed to do this due to restraints in capital and technologies, he added.\n\nAt this time, CanSino Biologics has not reported any revenue. But it has 15 vaccine candidates in the pipeline for 12 diseases. The company has three near-commercial vaccines, including one for the Ebola virus, for example, according to its interim report released last month.", "description": "CanSino Biologics Inc, the Chinese mainland's first vaccine maker listed in Hong Kong, plans to file for a listing on Shanghai's tech-focused STAR Market, or the sci-tech innovation board, in the hope of raising about 1 billion yuan ($141.33 million).", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/16/5da680fba310cf3e97a17239.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
