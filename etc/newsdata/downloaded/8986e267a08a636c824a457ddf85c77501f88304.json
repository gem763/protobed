(Sept. 18) AP, AP\n\nWhen Juul Labs and Pax Labs split from one company into two in 2017, they seemed destined to reach new heights.\n\nJuul would conquer the e-cigarette industry. Pax would dominate the marijuana vaping business.\n\nTheir fortunes, however, quickly diverged. Juul found itself under fire for its alleged role in getting kids hooked on nicotine after pitching itself as a safe alternative to cigarettes; Pax largely escaped scrutiny as the burgeoning cannabis market made the company irresistible to investors.\n\nBut that honeymoon period might be ending for Pax.\n\nLess than six months after backers plunged $420 million into Pax, the San Francisco-based company that makes vaporizers and empty pods is staring down a national health crisis that threatens to engulf both companies.\n\nSocial Security raise: Social Security cost-of-living increase will raise benefits 1.6%\n\nIs your clunker ready to be junked?

(Photo: Artranq, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nFederal authorities are tracking an outbreak of vaping-related lung illnesses, about 75% of which have been tied to products containing THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Authorities say half of the THC products tested so far also included vitamin E acetate.\n\nThere\u2019s no proof any of Pax\u2019s products have caused injuries. Its vaping devices are shipped to preapproved suppliers who fill the pods with cannabis leaves or oils, including THC products, to be vaped.\n\n\u201cNo PAX products have been involved in any of these cases,\u201d the company said in a statement on Sept. 11. \u201cWhile the cause is yet to be determined, none of the brand partners who fill and distribute our pods use Vitamin E acetate in PAX formulations, and all pods are subject to rigorous state regulatory compliance and testing. We select our partners with careful diligence.\u201d\n\nBut on Oct. 4, the Food and Drug Administration advised Americans to immediately cease vaping THC products of any kind, including items bought from seemingly trustworthy companies.\n\nThe agency also advised people not to \u201cmodify or add any substances such as THC or other oils to products purchased in stores.\u201d\n\nThose recommendations thrust the company's business model into crisis mode, said Marianne Udow-Phillips, executive director of the University of Michigan's Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation, which uses data analysis to advise policymakers and practitioners on health issues.\n\n\"There is great risk for Pax right now,\" she said. \"The problem is that we don\u2019t really know yet \u2013 the science isn\u2019t there \u2013 what is causing all these illnesses.\"\n\nPax has a lot at stake. The privately held company\u2019s annual revenue is about $262 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Pax said last month it had sold more than half a million devices used to vape \u201coil concentrates,\u201d which include products containing THC. In April, the company was valued at $1.7 billion, according to investment tracker Crunchbase.\n\nFacing questions over the exact nature of the illnesses, Pax announced the formation of a \u201chealth advisory board\u201d in late September.\n\n\u201cAmid growing concern about the risks \u2013 and prevalence \u2013 of illicit cannabis, our top priority at PAX remains consumer safety,\u201d the company's newly appointed CEO, Lisa Sergi, said in a statement Sept. 25, days after the sudden departure of CEO Bharat Vasan.\n\nMarijuana vaping company Pax Labs shows off products at Digital Experience in connection with the Consumer Electronics Show on Jan. 7, 2019. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY)\n\nPax says only preapproved \"brand partners\" are authorized to provide vaping liquids or flower for its devices. But social media reports and videos unearthed by USA TODAY show some users are hacking Pax products to use their own homemade THC oils.\n\nIn one YouTube video with more than 56,000 views, a user named \u201cVape HowTos\u201d demonstrates a technique on how to use oils that were not intended for the Pax Era.\n\n\u201cYou can save money by refilling your Pax Era Pods instead of buying new ones,\u201d Vape HowTos says in a description accompanying the video.\n\nLung illnesses tied to vaping appears to be related to THC products, according to the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Photo: AleksandrYu, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nRobert Jackler \u2013 a vaping watchdog and Stanford University professor and otologist-neurotologist who specializes in complex ear diseases \u2013 questioned how Pax could reach the conclusion that its products have not been tied to any illnesses.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether Pax pods are injuring people,\u201d he said.\n\nDianne Gleason, head of communications for Pax, declined both an interview request from USA TODAY and an offer to respond to written questions.\n\nInstead, in response to a separate question on the nature of the Juul spinoff, she provided a statement on \"significant misreporting\" about the move. She said the former Pax Labs Inc. changed its name to Juul Labs Inc. on June 30, 2017, and concurrently spun off its marijuana business as a separate company that assumed the name of its predecessor, becoming the new Pax Labs.\n\n\"Since it spun off PAX in 2017, JUUL has not held any ownership interest in PAX, and the companies have operated as completely separate entities,\" Gleason said.\n\nPAX Era, good vibes, and the sunset.\n\nThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s the tweet. pic.twitter.com/4Y0OvUBySz \u2014 PAX (@PAXvapor) July 29, 2019\n\nWhen the spinoff occurred, there were no indications of an outbreak ahead. But in recent months, lung injuries tied to vaping have killed at least 26 people and sickened 1,299 as of Oct. 8, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe agency said on Oct. 4. that the majority of patients who got sick from THC vaping did so after using \u201cprefilled cartridges obtained from informal sources.\u201d\n\nThe CDC also specified its data is unclear on whether the cause is \u201cTHC itself or a substance associated with prefilled THC cartridges, such as a cutting agent or adulterant.\u201d\n\nPax has largely escaped scrutiny as watchdogs and federal investigators primarily trained their sights on Juul and other nicotine-focused vaping companies. (Juul is now facing a criminal investigation and a potential federal ban on nicotine vaping flavors.)\n\n\u201cThese tragic illnesses are focusing legislative attention on nicotine e-cigs,\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, said on Twitter last month. \u201cAt what point do they also instigate efforts to reign in dangerous THC and a proliferation of unregulated cannabis vape products, especially national brands of CBD vape hardware?\"\n\nOn Friday, Gottlieb singled out Pax for its role in \u201cinstigating\u201d the vaping of TCH.\n\n\u201cThe device isn\u2019t what\u2019s killing people, it\u2019s what\u2019s in the liquids. Why the devices are significant is that their promotion is popularizing the activity of vaping THC,\u201d he said in a text message to USA TODAY. \u201cPax spends a half a billion marketing devices for vaping THC (and) guess what happens? More people vape THC.\u201d\n\nPax did not respond to a request to comment on Gottlieb's statement.\n\nThese tragic illnesses are focusing legislative attention on nicotine e-cigs.

The arrangement allows the company \u201cto deliver a good experience without the complexity of trying to figure out exactly what the pods are filled with,\u201d Vasan said.\n\nWhile Pax only authorizes certain providers to supply cannabis products for its pods, consumers have figured out ways to hack the pods to insert their own blends. In one YouTube video, a user named Stoner Stuff shows how to use a syringe to refill Era pods with THC oil from other sources.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried it \u2013 it hits well, it works great,\u201d Stoner Stuff says in the video posted March 22.\n\nPax pod-hacking is especially concerning to health experts because the ramifications of vaping marijuana are still poorly understood.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know the long-term effects,\u201d said Jackler, the Stanford professor.\n\nHe rejected the suggestion that Pax should escape blame for people misusing its product because the company \"had no idea\" this could happen.\n\nScott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner. (Photo: Tim Loehrke, USAT)\n\nVasan declined to comment for this story, pointing instead to a blog post on his exit.\n\n\u201cLeading PAX and driving its mission to establish cannabis as a force for good, has been the privilege of a lifetime,\" he wrote.\n\nWhat are long-term effects?\n\nIt\u2019s not fair for anyone to suggest Pax could be responsible for lung illnesses, said Pax and Juul shareholder Kurt Sonderegger.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear this is from black-market THC cartridges,\u201d said Sonderegger, who once served as vice president of marketing for Pax Labs. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real problems\u201d with Pax products.\n\nThe CDC said Oct. 10 that \"no single product or substance has been linked to all lung injury cases\" but warned users to steer clear of THC products altogether \"to avoid potentially harmful effects.\"\n\nCLOSE It can take six tries for a child to quit vaping. Here are three key signs your kid might be vaping. USA TODAY\n\nErika Sward, assistant vice president of national advocacy at the American Lung Association, said one concern with vaping \u201cis that it may be an accumulated impact\u201d from long-term use. \"The dangers of inhaling chemicals in your lungs\u201d should not be underestimated, she added.\n\nIn its statement introducing the health advisory board, Pax pledged to explore \u201cvaporization safety, mental health and medical applications,\" and noted that it \u201cPAX Labs does not manufacture, produce or sell cannabis.\u201d\n\nBut Scott Schlesinger, a lawyer who has sued Juul and Pax on behalf of teenage clients, said the issue with Pax is \u201cthey look the other way and (say), \u2018Here, you fill it\u2019\u201d to avoid legal scrutiny.\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Jayne O'Donnell contributed to this report.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/14/thc-vaping-crisis-juul-labs-pax-labs-marijuana/3920362002/", "description": "Juul spinoff Pax Labs is suddenly immersed in the nation's marijuana vaping crisis as authorities flag deadly illnesses potentially connected to THC.", "authors": ["Nathan Bomey", "Published A.M.
