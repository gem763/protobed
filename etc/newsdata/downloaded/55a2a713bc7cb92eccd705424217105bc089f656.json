If the baby came early, I would miss Antwerp and then maybe play at the Paris Masters.\"\n\nThe couple already have two children named Sophia, three, and Edie, one, and there is a strong possibility Murray will take a break from tennis when the baby is born.\n\nMurray most recently competed in the Shanghai Masters, where he was involved in an on-court spat with Fabio Fognini during his second round defeat.\n\nHe told the Italian to \"shut up\" after he had shouted before Murray put away a volley in the deciding set.\n\n(Image: James Watkins / BACKGRID)\n\nMurray's aim is now to compete in the Australian Open in January after a turbulent year in which he considered retirement before undergoing career-saving hip surgery.\n\n\"I had two years of having lots of pain after every single match,\" he said. \"Now I play a match, the body hurts, I have some pain in my back, the muscles are tired and things like that, but my hip is fine and I couldn't remember what that was like before.\n\n\"It has been hard but I expected it to be quite a bumpy road because it wasn't something that has been done in tennis before.\"", "description": "The 32-year-old is currently in Antwerp for the European Open but Kim is due to give birth at any time", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "James Veysey Rex", "Daily Mirror", "James Watkins", "Backgrid"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14129292.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Racegoers-on-Day-2-Ladies-Day-of-the-2019-Cheltenham-Festival.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
