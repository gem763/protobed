Having been steadily climbing in the polls, she cemented her place as the new leading candidate by facing a barrage of questions from a number of the lesser lights looking to knock her off her perch.\n\nIt was bad news for Joe Biden, who had a mostly quiet night having been top of the majority of the polls for months. It is clear that other candidates are starting to believe he is not the force they feared.\n\nBut beyond the two-hour debate and the reaction on Twitter, Facebook and the cable news networks, what of any significance is there to take from the debate?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The billionaire Tom Steyer, who jumped into the race in July, is best known for funding a campaign pushing for the impeachment of Donald Trump.

Sanders\u2019s biggest piece of news across the evening was the announcement that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will join him at a rally on Saturday to endorse his candidacy. That could lead to AOC\u2019s entire \u201csquad\u201d of first-time congresswomen backing Sanders. Such endorsements will likely help the senator\u2019s campaign much more than a debate performance.\n\nAutumn in the year before a presidential election is the time when Washington normally turns its attention to the primary debates, but with an impeachment inquiry under way, the Democratic Party has bigger fish to fry at the moment.\n\nGiven the Trump administration\u2019s abstinence about allowing information to make its way to the investigation or for witnesses to give testimony, the party\u2019s leading figures are concentrating on fighting that battle.\n\nThe impeachment proceedings will have a larger impact on 2020 than the debates, if the Democrats get what they want, so it is little wonder.\n\nWith the Democrat presidential candidate field so large, there is also increased focus on the early polling in some of the first states to vote in the primary race as analysts look for anyway to whittle down the field. While such early data can be untrustworthy in the long run, polls from Iowa and New Hampshire are starting to be pored over.\n\nThere may be more focus on the next Democrat debate in November if the field is slimmed down further, or if Warren, Sanders and Biden begin to attack each other more. But for now, Washington has only one major focus \u2013 Trump and impeachment.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren was the big story of the latest Democrat debate.
