I know there is another side. And the other side is greater than my PPD-riddled-temporarily-adjusted-brain could have ever imagined: as a mum. As an artist. As a friend. As a collaborator. As a leader. As a boss. As an activist,\u201d Morissette wrote.\n\n\u201cI saw how things got richer after I came through it the last two times. I have my eye on that prize again... even as I drag my ass through the molasses.\u201d\n\nThe musician added that she has \u201cso much more support\u201d the third time around, explaining that she prepared \u201cas much as she could beforehand\u201d for the eventuality of suffering from PPD.\n\n\u201cSome parts of the care-prep have been a godsend, and well-planned. But for all of this preparation \u2013 PPD is still a sneaky monkey with a machete \u2013 working its way through my psyche and body and days and thoughts and bloodwork levels,\u201d Morissette said.\n\nThe singer said how, in her opinion, modern society is \u201cnot set up to honour women properly after birth\u201d.\n\n\u201cI see it changing, which is so heartening... but the general way is bereft of the honouring and tenderness and attunement and village-ness that postpartum deeply warrants,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is where the fabric of our culture, of our world, is crafted. On physical, emotional, neurobiological, chemical, spiritual, mental, existential, practical levels. Wouldn\u2019t it be cool if we treated all postpartum mums and families with this awareness and honour[?]\u201d\n\nMorissette concluded her message with the emphatic statement: \u201cWe\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nPostnatal depression affects more than one in every 10 women within a year of giving birth, the NHS states.\n\nSymptoms can include a persistent feeling of sadness, lack of enjoyment and interest, fatigue, difficulty bonding with your baby and lack of concentration.\n\nMorissette gave birth to her first child with rapper Mario \u201cSouleye\u201d Treadway in 2010, a son called Ever.\n\nTheir second child, a daughter called Onyx, was born in June 2016.\n\nYou can contact the Pre and Postnatal Depression Advice and Support (PANDAS) helpline on 0843 28 98 401.
