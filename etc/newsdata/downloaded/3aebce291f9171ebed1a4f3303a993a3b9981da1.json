The footage spread like wildfire and judgement was made that the Bok environment is a racist one.\n\nBut then the player released a video claiming that, as a starting XV player, he actually didn\u2019t belong in said huddle because the replacements \u2013 apparently nicknamed the Boom Squad \u2013 have their own post-match celebration.\n\nBut the woke police dismissed Mapimpi\u2019s utterances as a lie because he knows which side his bread is buttered on. While that scenario is obviously not implausible, it\u2019s incredible how the original narrative prevailed due to opinion trumping what one would, at some level, have to entertain as Mapimpi\u2019s facts.\n\nThe overriding thing about the Etzebeth situation for me is how many questions are still unanswered about it, which makes it a grey area and not the clear-cut case presented to us in social and traditional media circles.\n\nThe first is how is it that Etzebeth was not arrested and charged with assault and crimen injuria? My flimsy grasp of the law is that when you hit someone else, you get arrested, charged, appear in court, post bail and get a court date for trial.\n\nWhy this doesn\u2019t seem to have happened in this case is worth asking because having Etzebeth languish in a Langebaan police station instead of being announced as part of the Bok squad may have persuaded SA Rugby \u2013 whose conduct has borne the hallmarks of an organisation hoping this would go away \u2013 to institute the belated investigation they did this week then, and prevent him from going to Japan.\n\nAlso, I thought Etzebeth was with a group of about 10 people, so why is he the only one being charged?\n\nThe noises coming out of the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) have been incongruous, with commissioner Chris Nissen preaching innocence until proven guilty, while acting head of legal services Buang Jones was quoted as saying Etzebeth had been getting away with murder, would be made an example of and should be charged with attempted murder.\n\nForget the inflammatory nature of the latter\u2019s statement, the contradiction in the SAHRC\u2019s message is staggering.\n\nThen there\u2019s the news that the victims are now claiming more than R1 million in damages from the player.\n\nGiven the talk about one of the victims having had to return to hospital, the demand for money is understandable.\n\nBut few things weaken your quest for justice more than a demand for money, regardless of how you feel justice won\u2019t be forthcoming.\n\nLong story short, there are many unanswered questions in a case that has been badly handled all round, yet we\u2019ve all made up our minds well before it makes it to court.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @simxabanisa\n\n\n\n", "description": "Given the spot judgements that have abounded since the story broke, it\u2019s hard to comprehend that the Eben Etzebeth assault and racism case was only referred to the equality court on Friday, presumably because of the many questions that needed to be a", "authors": ["Simnikiwe Xabanisa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9439/991f33bf9a914c14ae340f98fb7a8e9c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
