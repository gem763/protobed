Katie Hill Katherine (Katie) Lauren HillThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Dems shift strategy on impeachment vote Feehery: How Republicans can win back the suburbs California secretary of state eyes running for Katie Hill seat MORE\u2019s (D-Calif.) resignation this week after nude photos of her surfaced online has reignited a debate over the need for a federal \u201crevenge porn\u201d law.\n\nThe freshman lawmaker, who resigned amid allegations she had inappropriate sexual relationships with congressional and campaign staffers, said Monday that after she leaves Congress she will devote her time to fighting revenge porn, a term used to describe when an intimate or explicit image is published without the consent of the person photographed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nForty-six states and the District of Columbia have laws banning the practice, but there is no comparable statute at the federal level. That discrepancy has created legal challenges \u2014 like whether Hill\u2019s case falls under D.C. or California laws \u2014 and inconsistent enforcement.\n\nBills to address the issue have been introduced in both chambers of Congress this year, though none have made it out of committee. However, the circumstances surrounding Hill\u2019s resignation may galvanize those legislative efforts.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that the attention that is being paid to the Katie Hill case might push it forward,\u201d said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law and president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative.\n\nThe most prominent revenge porn bill on Capitol Hill \u2014 the Stopping Harmful Image Exploitation and Limiting Distribution (SHIELD) Act \u2014 would establish federal criminal liability for individuals who share private, sexually explicit or nude images without the consent of those photographed.\n\n\u201cFederal legislation, the SHIELD Act \u2026 is the most clear, comprehensive law that you could have on the books. And it has the added benefit of being federal, so you don\u2019t have the jurisdictional question,\u201d said Franks, who helped draft the bill.\n\nThe measure was introduced in May by Reps.

Who uploaded it, exactly? And where exactly was congresswoman Hill when she found out about it?\u201d Rogers said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFranks added that different state laws have different definitions of revenge porn.\n\n\u201cThe downside has been that these 46 states and D.C. have all come up with varying definitions of what nonconsensual pornography is. They\u2019re all coming up with different penalties and there is a lot of confusion about which law would actually control in any given situation, especially given the fact that nonconsensual pornography so often occurs over the internet,\u201d she said.\n\nFor example, while D.C. law requires the victim to prove the disseminator had an intent to hurt them or get a financial benefit, California only requires the victim to prove they experienced \u201cserious emotional distress.\u201d\n\nWhile federal legislation has been introduced before, this year\u2019s SHIELD Act is seen by its supporters of having better prospects than in previous years.\n\n\u201cAs the author of the SHIELD Act and someone who has worked to eliminate so-called revenge porn, I\u2019ve spoken with many survivors of these attacks and I know that the financial, emotional, and professional toll they suffer is staggering and does not end with the initial violation,\u201d Speier said in a statement to The Hill.\n\n\u201cThis is precisely why we need a federal law to bar this predatory behavior and hold those who commit such revengeful acts legally accountable for their malignant behavior.\u201d\n\nHill is not the first lawmaker to resign from Congress after nude photos were posted online.\n\nFormer Rep.
