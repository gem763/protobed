But the company has experienced tremendous growth over the past couple of years. It now has a shot at becoming a global leader when it comes to payments via direct debit. Its co-founder and CEO Hiroki Takeuchi has become a fintech expert, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m excited to announce that Hiroki Takeuchi will join us at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin.\n\nGoCardless has a pretty self-explanatory name. While many small and big companies still rely on credit cards and sometimes even (gasp) cheques, GoCardless wants to make it easier to switch to direct debit payments. The company\u2019s API lets you get started and accept recurring payments in no time.\n\nThe advantages are obvious. First, card payments were never designed for recurring subscriptions. They expire and lead to churn. If you\u2019re running a subscription business with card payments, you\u2019re basically leaving money on the table.\n\nSecond, card payments can be expensive. Stripe charges 2.9% + 30 cents for each transaction in the U.S. for instance. GoCardless costs 1% per transaction.\n\nIf you\u2019re a global company, GoCardless has been slowly expanding its footprint with many supported direct debit schemes, such as SEPA in Europe, Bacs direct debit in the U.K., ACH debit in the U.S. and many more.\n\nBut GoCardless doesn\u2019t want to stop at consumer subscriptions. The company thinks direct debit payments could represent a big opportunity for B2B use cases. It\u2019s cheaper and provides a lot more visibility than cheques.\n\nWhile many startups also talk about resilience, Hiroki Takeuchi actually knows what resilience feels like on a personal and professional level. TechCrunch\u2019s Steve O\u2019Hear wrote a thoughtful interview with him shortly after a serious road accident that has left him paralyzed below his chest.\n\nA few months ago, the company raised a $75 million Series E round with an impressive list of investors that included Adams Street Partners, GV, Salesforce Ventures, Accel Partners, Balderton Capital, Notion Capital and Passion Capital.\n\nBuy your ticket to Disrupt Berlin to listen to this discussion \u2014 and many others. The conference will take place December 11-12.\n\nIn addition to panels and fireside chats, like this one, new startups will participate in the Startup Battlefield to compete for the highly coveted Battlefield Cup.", "description": "GoCardless has been around for 8 years.
