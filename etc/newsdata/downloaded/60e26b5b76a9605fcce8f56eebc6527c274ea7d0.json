You don\u2019t have to worry about getting back down to the $1.6 million limit for 12 months as her pension won\u2019t count until 12 months after you inherited it.\n\nThen when it is counted, the amount will be deemed to be whatever value the pension was on the day she died, not what it\u2019s grown or shrunk to in the subsequent 12 months.\n\nThis can be good if it\u2019s increased in value (as you get away with not counting this growth) but bad if it falls in value (as you will have to count the full value of her pension when she died even though by the time it actually counts it\u2019ll be worth less).\n\nAnother potential benefit of having a reversionary pension, says Heffron, is where you have an entitlement to a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. If you have this card, which gives self-funded retirees access to discounted prescriptions via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme among other health benefits, making the pensions reversionary can help you.\n\nA benefit of a reversionary pension is that it allows you to continue the pension rather than start something new.\n\nBecause the pension is continuing, it will hang on to the special status it had because it was established before January 1, 2015. That\u2019s when the Coalition government restricted social security benefits to higher-income earners by (among other things) limiting those entitled to the seniors health card. It decreed that income from account-based super pensions would in future be included in the income test for the CSHC. Where it is and the income threshold of currently $55,808 for a single retiree is exceeded, the health card will be lost.\n\nAs far as the 12 months' entitlement to continue with an existing pension and the concession granted to pre-January 2015 CSHC holders is concerned, this special treatment is only available where there is no question the pension can continue without you needing to make any decisions as the trustee of your SMSF.\n\nOne essential task is to double check your trust deed and existing binding nominations, says Heffron. If the rules in your trust deed state that a binding nomination over-rules a reversionary pension, you might find that putting a reversionary pension in place makes no difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, not all SMSF trust deeds allow a reversionary beneficiary entitlement after a pension has started, says Heffron. Some may require the inherited pension to be stopped and then restarted, action that will result in CSHC grandfathering being lost.\n\nIf this is a possibility, she says, one option could be to amend the SMSF trust deed before passing any reversionary beneficiary resolutions.\n\nMaking certain you can include reversionary resolutions for the entitlements that come with them is particularly important if you want to maximise how much of your partner\u2019s super either of you want to retain in your SMSF, says Heffron.\n\nThere is an important rule that states that if someone dies their super must be \u201cpaid out\u201d of the fund.\n\nIf you faced inheriting your wife\u2019s super in a year from now, for instance, the neatest way to do so would be as a reversionary pension. If her super pension balance happened to be $950,000 when you inherited this, you could include it as a separate pension that is part of your overall $1.6 million pension cap by rolling back $950,000 of your pension into an accumulation account. You could pay yourself lump sums from this if you needed to do so.\n\nYou would then have a smaller pension plus the amount in your accumulation account where the investment earnings will be taxed at 15 per cent.\n\nThis would meet the superannuation law requirement to pay out her death benefit. By rolling back enough of your super so that when her pension hits your transfer balance account on the 12-month anniversary of her death, you won\u2019t exceed the $1.6 million pension limit.\n\nBut if you were to die first with, say, a $1.6 million reversionary pension, she could roll over her entire pension into an accumulation account and treat this as super from which she could pay herself lump sums while your pension \u2013 which is now hers \u2013 would continue to pay her income.\n\nEmail journalist John Wasiliev with your questions at superquestions@afr.com.", "description": "There can be benefits in having a reversionary pension as part of your retirement income arrangements, writes John Wasiliev, who answers your questions on super.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4572%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7cb65c3f20ade0fbf39131b3d70a366ff1ac339e", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
