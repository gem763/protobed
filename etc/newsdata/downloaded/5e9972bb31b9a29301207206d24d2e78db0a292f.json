They\u2019re dead. As far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019re dead,\u201d he said Monday.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s pronouncement appeared to contradict comments on Sunday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said in several televised interviews that he hoped negotiations continue. \u201cI hope we get them started back,\u201d he said on Fox News. \u201cIt will ultimately be up to the Taliban.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo is among those who have proposed continuing talks with the Taliban, a person familiar with the administration deliberations said. Mr. Pompeo on Sunday said Mr. Khalilzad was being recalled to Washington \u201cto chart the path forward,\u201d indicating talks could resume.\n\nState Department officials didn\u2019t respond to questions on Monday about Mr. Khalilzad\u2019s plans to return or Mr. Pompeo\u2019s view of the talks in light of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nMr. Trump last year called off a planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un weeks before the meeting, and threatened to take military action if necessary. He soon reversed course, and the summit was held as scheduled.\n\nThe developments left uncertain the status of possible U.S. troop withdrawals from Afghanistan. Under proposed terms of a U.S.-Taliban agreement, the U.S. would withdraw about 5,000 troops within 135 days after completion of the deal. There are currently about 14,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n\nThe U.S. military has refused to publicly discuss its force posture. U.S. officials on Monday said there are no immediate plans to decrease the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. One official said the Pentagon is still sorting out the status of the talks.\n\nMr. Trump has said before that the U.S. could take drastic military action to end the war, but has said he doesn\u2019t want to do so. \u201cWe would beat them very easily militarily if we wanted to, by doing certain things, and I\u2019m not talking nuclear,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cWe could have that over with very, very rapidly, but you would lose millions and millions of lives, and I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nIn July, Mr. Trump said, \u201cIf I wanted to win that war, Afghanistan would be wiped off the face of the Earth.\u201d He added he wouldn\u2019t take such a step because he didn\u2019t want to kill 10 million people.\n\nHe denied on Monday that he had overruled top aides by pursuing a set of meetings involving the Taliban at Camp David.\n\nMr. Trump decided to hold the meeting at the Maryland retreat even though Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser John Bolton advised that such a summit could be problematic, people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nMr. Trump said in a tweet on Saturday that he had decided to cancel the previously unannounced Camp David meeting because of the death of the U.S. soldier last week. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr. Trump said he didn\u2019t consult any advisers before canceling the meeting. \u201cI took my own advice,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Bolton had tried to counter the plan for a Camp David meeting for several days and Mr. Pence told Mr. Trump he believed Mr. Bolton was correct on the issue, adding that inviting the Taliban could have serious political implications, a person familiar with the discussions said.\n\nMr. Trump in a Twitter post Monday afternoon didn\u2019t dispute the existence of opposition to his plan to hold Camp David talks, but he denied that the decision to try to go ahead with the meeting caused turmoil at the White House.\n\n\u201cI always think it is good to meet and talk, but in this case I decided not to,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMr. Trump wrote on Twitter that it is fake news to report that he \u201coverruled the VP and various advisers on a potential Camp David meeting with the Taliban. This story is False!\u201d he wrote.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters he had been open to meeting the Taliban at Camp David, saying criticism of the plan wasn\u2019t as important as ending the war. He added that he wouldn\u2019t meet the Taliban at the White House, saying that was a step too far.\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani speaks during a ceremony to introduce the new chief of the intelligence service in Kabul on Monday.

A tentative agreement didn\u2019t involve the Afghan government.\n\nMessrs. Khalilzad and Bolton have long known each other and often don\u2019t see eye to eye on various issues, a person familiar with their relationship said, adding that tensions in their relationship dated back to the administration of George W. Bush in the early 2000s.\n\nPlans to hold talks with the Taliban at Camp David also drew criticism from members of Congress, some noting that the retreat served as the site for planning U.S. responses to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nWrite to Vivian Salama at vivian.salama@wsj.com and Michael C.
