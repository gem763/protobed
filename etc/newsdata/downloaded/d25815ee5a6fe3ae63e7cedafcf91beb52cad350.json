A correspondent with KMAX-TV, he was reporting from the Sacramento International Auto Show on the final day.\n\nAs he couldn\u2019t get any car representative to talk to him he decided to lay on one of the cars that were on display. This incident didn\u2019t go down well with people on social media and they called this behaviour \u2018inappropriate\u2019 and the person \u2018shameless\u2019.\n\n\u201cI feel like a kid in a candy store without the owner because you can do anything,\u201d Cardenas is heard saying on camera. He found a baby pink Ford Thunderbird, but when he opened the car\u2019s door to hop inside, he accidentally hit the car next to it.\n\nWatch the video here:\n\nHe was fired after the producer of the auto show reached out to the General Manager of the channel.\n\n\u201cI may have crossed the line a bit, but my intentions were never to disrespect the owners of the vehicles, although it seemed that way,\u201d Cardenas wrote in a message to the channel, reportedly told Buzzfeed. \u201cIt was really a dumb choice on my part,\u201d the journalist admitted.\n\nDon't Miss 110 SHARES 3.6 K SHARES 445 SHARES 647 SHARES\n\nWhat do you think: Was it a dumb move or not?", "description": "It was not a good day for Angel Cardenas, a TV reporter, who lost his job after he was filmed jumping on vintage cars during reporting.
