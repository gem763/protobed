Those facing scrutiny suspect he\u2019s chasing conspiracy theories.", "language": "en", "text": "Those involved in the FBI investigation said they are mystified by the attorney general\u2019s activities and interest in the professor, Joseph Mifsud, and they suspect that Barr might be using Justice Department resources to validate conjecture that Mifsud was deployed against a Trump adviser by Western intelligence to manufacture a basis to investigate the campaign.\n\n\u201cIt just seems like they\u2019re doing everything they can to delegitimize the origins of that investigation,\u201d said one person involved with the Russia probe, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the politically sensitive matter that is still being reviewed. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real basis to disparage it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Barr\u2019s inquiry has heartened Trump and his conservative allies. Trump, who at times has inquired about the origins of the Russia investigation and the professor in particular, has bragged that Barr will get to the bottom of the case and is doing a good job as the country\u2019s top law enforcement official, a White House official said.\n\n\u2018The enigma of the entire Mueller probe\u2019: Focus on origins of Russian investigation puts spotlight on Maltese professor\n\nBarr\u2019s defenders assert that he is exploring what he views as possible problems.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a conspiracy theorist. He\u2019s a realist,\u201d said George Terwilliger, a former deputy attorney general and longtime friend of Barr\u2019s. \u201cAnd I\u2019m confident that if he has a concern that justifies his personal involvement, it\u2019s based on fact, not conjecture.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nUnproven or vague allegations about impropriety in the origins of the FBI\u2019s Russia probe have long been passed between Trump, his conservative allies on Capitol Hill and the conservative media ecosystem \u2014 with the country\u2019s top law enforcement official and conservative lawmakers sometimes helping to fuel them.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) wrote in recent days to Australian, Italian and British officials, asking them to cooperate in Barr\u2019s review of the Russia investigation and asserting that the attorney general was \u201csimply doing his job.\u201d Graham said in an interview that he expected Mifsud to be a significant part of the investigation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a curious character in this whole deal, and we need to know more about him,\u201d Graham said, adding that he had not talked to Barr about the matter.\n\n\u201cWhatever Barr finds is fine with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing there, there is nothing there. I trust him.\u201d\n\nAttorney general says he believes \u2018spying did occur\u2019 in probe of Trump campaign associates\n\nBarr has never spoken specifically about his view on the theories surrounding Mifsud, though people familiar with his thinking say he is interested in the professor and the broader work of the U.S. intelligence community surrounding the Trump campaign. The Washington Post recently reported that Barr had been traveling abroad \u2014 to the United Kingdom and Italy, in particular \u2014 to ask his foreign counterparts to aid in the Justice Department\u2019s review of the matter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBarr has long harbored suspicions about the Russia probe, which began before the 2016 election and was later overtaken by then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III after Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey early in his tenure as president. Even before he was nominated, Barr had written a letter to Justice Department leaders asserting that the special counsel\u2019s theory of how Trump might have obstructed justice in the Russia probe seemed \u201cfatally misconceived.\u201d At a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing in April, Barr said he believed \u201cspying did occur\u201d against the Trump campaign \u2014 using a term some feel has a negative connotation, and one which FBI Director Christopher A. Wray later said he would not use.\n\nIn May, it was revealed that Barr had assigned U.S. Attorney John H. Durham to determine if the U.S. government\u2019s \u201cintelligence collection activities\u201d related to the Trump campaign were \u201clawful and appropriate.\u201d Barr told CBS News that month that some of the facts he had learned \u201cdon\u2019t hang together with the official explanations of what happened,\u201d but he declined to be more specific.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I really will say,\u201d Barr said. \u201cThings are just not jiving.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe unproven theory about Mifsud is that the Maltese professor was working to set up the Trump campaign. Mifsud was undeniably critical to the FBI\u2019s decision to open an investigation. He boasted to Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos about having \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton in the form of \u201cthousands of emails\u201d \u2014 before Russia\u2019s hacking of Democrats was publicly known. When the FBI learned of that conversation some months later, it opened a case.\n\nMueller\u2019s team wrote that Mifsud \u201chad connections to Russia,\u201d and Comey has described him more bluntly as a \u201cRussian agent.\u201d\n\nJames Baker, who was the FBI\u2019s general counsel when the bureau opened the counterintelligence probe, defended the investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important that the American people have confidence in the intelligence community,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident that there was no attempted coup and that nothing was done for political reasons.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBaker said that after Durham was appointed, he contacted the prosecutor and offered to cooperate with the review. Durham has yet to contact Baker, Baker said.\n\nDavid Laufman, a former Justice Department counterintelligence official involved in the early stages of the Russia investigation, said on Twitter that Barr\u2019s \u201cspearheading of a Justice Dept. investigation to pursue conspiracy theories about the 2016 election is cause for alarm at the hijacking of a great institution to vindicate partisan political grievances.\u201d\n\nMifsud was never accused of crimes and last surfaced two years ago for an interview with a reporter in Italy. That has fueled speculation, particularly from those who want to discredit the Russia probe, that he is not what the FBI says he is.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani told The Washington Post that he was interested in Mifsud because it \u201cseems to me it was a counterintelligence setup . . . a rather typical CIA plot to create a basis for the investigation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani noted that he had not talked to Barr or Durham about the matter. A person familiar with Barr\u2019s thinking said Barr has questioned the wisdom of Giuliani\u2019s attempts to get foreign nations, especially Ukraine, to pursue investigations of interest to the president because Giuliani is operating outside normal government channels.\n\nPapadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Mifsud, has tweeted that Mifsud was \u201can Italian intelligence asset who the CIA weaponized.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCaroline Polisi, a lawyer for Papadopoulos, declined to say whether he has been contacted by Durham or Barr as part of the Justice Department\u2019s review.\n\nAttempts to locate Mifsud were unsuccessful. Stephan Roh, a Swiss lawyer who purports to represent him, has called accusations that Mifsud was a Russian asset \u201cdefamatory.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn Roh\u2019s 2018 book, which postulates that Mifsud was working with Western intelligence, Roh indicated that he interviewed Mifsud about his interactions with Papadopoulos that same month.\n\nRoh did not respond to questions about when he was last in contact with the professor or where he is located. In an email, he declined to comment on any interactions Mifsud has had with the Justice Department \u201cor if there were any.\u201d\n\nAccording to a former Italian government official, Barr first met with Gennaro Vecchione, the head of Italy\u2019s Security Intelligence Department, on Aug. 15, essentially to establish contact, and returned Sept. 27 for a second meeting with the heads of Italy\u2019s domestic and foreign intelligence services.\n\nBarr, the official said, \u201casked if Italian intelligence knew anything about Mifsud and if the Italians were aware of his role\u201d in the Russia investigation \u201cin terms of being involved in Italian intelligence itself or if he was politically tied with Italian political leaders allied with the Democrats.\u201d The Italians, the official said, \u201cexplained that there is no involvement by the Italian intelligence services in this \u2014 and the fact that we don\u2019t have any evidence of this plot.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey confirmed no connections, no activities, no interference,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe Justice Department inspector general is also examining aspects of the FBI\u2019s Russia probe, but some who have been questioned in it said that Mifsud has not seemed to be a key focus of investigators.\n\nBarr\u2019s critics say his efforts to investigate the investigators are meant to placate Trump \u2014 even if that means casting aspersions on U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\n\nBarr personally asked foreign officials to aid inquiry into CIA, FBI activities in 2016\n\nTrump had virtually no relationship with Barr when he chose him to be attorney general in late 2018, and conservative and liberal lawyers alike hoped that Barr might restore independence to the Justice Department that they felt had been eroded in the first years of Trump\u2019s presidency. Barr had been attorney general before, in the George H.W. Bush administration, and was widely respected in conservative legal circles.\n\nSome analysts said Barr disappointed quickly. His characterization of the Mueller report, they noted, hewed closely to Trump\u2019s favored talking point \u2014 no collusion, no obstruction \u2014 and Mueller felt it so misleading that he complained in a letter that the attorney general \u201cdid not fully capture the context, nature, and substance\u201d of the special counsel\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cLike most Republican lawyers or most lawyers in Washington, I expected that Bill Barr would be a very by-the-book sort of attorney general, especially since he had done it before and certainly knows the job,\u201d said Greg Brower, a former U.S. attorney now in private practice at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. \u201cUnfortunately, many people in town now think he is playing politics, or he\u2019s running the department in a way that he\u2019s too political.\u201d\n\nOther analysts, though, noted that Barr had essentially telegraphed the type of attorney general he would be before he was nominated. In addition to writing a memo critical of Mueller, Barr had opined to a New York Times reporter in 2017 that the basis for investigating alleged wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation, as well as the controversial sale of a uranium company to Russia while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, was stronger than the basis for launching the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cI have long believed that the predicate for investigating the uranium deal, as well as the [Clinton] Foundation, is far stronger than any basis for investigating so-called \u2018collusion,\u2019 \u201d Barr wrote.\n\nMatthew Miller, a Justice Department spokesman when Eric H. Holder Jr. was attorney general, said that when he first saw Barr\u2019s comment, \u201cI thought, this is someone who\u2019s had his brain warped by a couple decades of Fox News, and that\u2019s not the type of person that should be leading the Justice Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Trump basically got what he wanted at the Justice Department \u2014 which is someone that would define his job as protecting the president first and foremost,\u201d said Miller, who is an analyst for MSNBC.\n\nTerwilliger, the former deputy attorney general, disputed that assessment, saying Barr \u201cremains as straight an arrow and middle of the road as he can be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he thinks that there was malfeasance in some aspect of the way the government operated in a way that was designed to hurt the presidency, I think he has every right \u2014 indeed, a responsibility \u2014 to uncover that,\u201d Terwilliger said.\n\nBarr\u2019s critics and defenders alike note that he has long believed in a strong executive branch, and that is likely to inform some of his interest in protecting Trump and the office he holds.\n\n\u201cWhen you pair someone with that view of executive authority with this particular president,\u201d said Matt Axelrod, a Justice Department official when Loretta E. Lynch was attorney general, \u201cit\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\u201d\n\nBarr\u2019s defenders, though, note that he has generally enjoyed a good reputation and \u2014 given this job might be his last \u2014 he is unlikely to want to ruin it over causes in which he doesn\u2019t believe.\n\n\u201cThroughout his career, both in public life and in the corporate world, he\u2019s always been viewed as an individual of tremendous integrity and honesty and always beyond reproach,\u201d said Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the conservative Federalist Society legal organization. \u201cI just don\u2019t see him \u2014 at the twilight of his career, given everything he\u2019s done, and given his faith-based and spiritual life \u2014 coming off the rails at this point.\u201d\n\nEllen Nakashima contributed to this report.", "description": "The attorney general is particularly interested in a shadowy European professor at the center of much conservative conjecture.", "authors": ["Matt Zapotosky", "National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter", "Rosalind S.
