PRECIOUS-Gold dips as dollar holds strong ahead of Sino-U.S. trade talks\n\n* Gold set for third straight decline\n\n* Sino-U.S. trade talks to take place on Oct 10-11\n\n\n\n(Adds technicals; updates prices)\n\nBy Karthika Suresh Namboothiri\n\nOct 8 (Reuters) - Gold prices slipped to a near one-week low\n\non Tuesday, declining for a third straight session, weighed down\n\nby a firmer dollar ahead of the upcoming trade talks between\n\nChina and the United States.\n\nSpot gold was down 0.3% at $1,489.32 per ounce, as of\n\n0627 GMT. Prices had dropped 1% in the previous session.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.6% to $1,494.60 per ounce.\n\n\"One of the key factors to the gold market is the outlook\n\nfor global growth, and with trade developments between U.S. and\n\nChina, traders are on alert,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief\n\nmarket strategist at CMC Markets.\n\nTop-level trade talks are scheduled to resume on Thursday,\n\nwhen Chinese Vice Premier Liu He meets with U.S. Trade\n\nRepresentative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven\n\nMnuchin.\n\n\"The market is very vulnerable to headlines. Any further\n\nnews on discussions in the U.S. with negotiators in China could\n\nbe very important,\" McCarthy said.\n\nAsian shares inched up in early trade, though caution\n\nprevailed as expectations of a trade deal dimmed after\n\nWashington blacklisted Chinese companies over Beijing's\n\ntreatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities and\n\nPresident Donald Trump said a quick trade deal was unlikely.\n\nThe uncertainty regarding the outcome of trade talks had\n\npushed the dollar index higher overnight. A stronger U.S.\n\ncurrency makes dollar-denominated gold more expensive for\n\nholders of other currencies, which could subdue demand.\n\nThe talks are to proceed ahead of a scheduled increase in\n\nU.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30% from\n\n25% on Oct. 15. Trump has said the tariff increase will take\n\neffect if no progress is made in the negotiations.\n\nData from China on Tuesday did little to cheer markets after\n\nthe services sector grew at its slowest pace in seven months in\n\nSeptember, despite a strong increase in new orders. \"For the moment we are fairly in a trading range. There is\n\nsupport between $1,480 and $1,490, and resistance around $1,525\n\nto $1,530,\" McCarthy added.\n\nInvestors now await the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee's\n\nminutes from its September meeting, due on Wednesday, for clues\n\non whether the Fed will cut rates at its October meeting, in\n\nwhat could be its third interest rate cut for the year.\n\nSpot gold may break a support at $1,488 per ounce and fall\n\ntowards the range of $1,446-$1,462, Reuters technical analyst\n\nWang Tao said. Among other precious metals, silver dropped 0.6% to\n\n$17.34 an ounce, while platinum XPT= and palladium XPD= rose\n\n0.4% each to $880.25 and $1,665.93 respectively.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold dips as dollar holds strong ahead of Sino-U.S. trade talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB380UB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
