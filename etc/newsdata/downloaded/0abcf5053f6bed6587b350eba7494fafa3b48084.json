On Sunday they\u2019ll square off with the New York Giants again, hoping to avoid their first 0-4 start to a season since 2001. Here\u2019s what you need to know before kickoff:\n\nOpponent: New York Giants (1-2)\n\nWhere: MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J.\n\nWhen: Sunday, Sept. 29, 1 p.m.\n\nTelevision: Fox\n\nRadio: The Team 980, ESPN 630AM\n\nWhat to watch for:\n\n- Case Keenum played two solid games at quarterback without a turnover before coughing up the ball five times in Week 3 against the vaunted Chicago Bears defense. Then Keenum sat out Wednesday\u2019s walkthrough with a foot injury. Keenum returned to practice Thursday and coach Jay Gruden said he expects him to start, but is he 100% healthy? Even if he is, will he bounce back from his poor showing on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d?\n\n- The other starting quarterback in this game, Daniel Jones, experienced one of the fastest reputation turnarounds the NFL has ever seen. The Giants were roundly criticized for drafting Jones No. 6 overall last spring. One four-touchdown performance and comeback win later, Jones has New York already believing he\u2019s the future of the franchise. Sunday will be Jones\u2019 first start at MetLife Stadium, so the Giants faithful is sure to be psyched.\n\n- Amid an awful start to the Redskins\u2019 season, most people agree on one bright spot: Terry McLaurin. The 2019 third-round pick became the first receiver in NFL history to record five catches and one touchdown in each of his first three career games. Chad Johnson took notice and praised McLaurin on Twitter, writing, \u201cput it together like tonight consistently [and] they got to come see you.\u201d Against the Giants\u2019 32nd-ranked pass defense, the rookie has a chance to further prove he\u2019s a star in the making.\n\n- The Giants won\u2019t have star running back Saquon Barkley, who will miss several weeks with a high ankle sprain he suffered last week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nPre-game reading:\n\nThe latest #Redskins quarterback argument could become epic, maybe even RG III 2.0, @thomloverro writes. https://t.co/uaOKlsPcjP \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 25, 2019\n\n\n\nDaniel Jones has provided the Giants the kind of hope that #Redskins fans need, @Matthew_Paras writes. https://t.co/RdO4cOU0cp \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 26, 2019\n\n\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
