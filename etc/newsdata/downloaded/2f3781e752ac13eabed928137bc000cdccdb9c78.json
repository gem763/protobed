It would declare war on whatever legislative agenda they still have,\u201d one former administration official said.\n\nThat may not matter for Trump\u2019s political standing or his popularity with his base, which has remained fairly constant during his presidency even in some of its most controversial moments.\n\n\u201cPeople have made up their minds on Trump. It would take a momentous event to change enough minds to alter his job approval rating away from the average of 43 or 44 percent,\u201d said Whit Ayres, founder and president of North Star Opinion Research, a Republican polling firm. \u201cWe\u2019re so polarized and in our tribes that people will look through their current lens and determine either the president did something wrong, or Joe Biden did something wrong.
