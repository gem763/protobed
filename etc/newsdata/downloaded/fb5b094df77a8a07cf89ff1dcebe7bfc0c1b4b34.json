The good news is that the country is actually far purpler than either red or blue. The most recent survey data shows that a majority of Democrats still consider themselves moderate or conservative while barely one in four see themselves as \u201cvery liberal\u201d; among Republicans, despite Trump\u2019s vaunted popularity, roughly 40 percent want their party to move closer to the center.\n\nA wide base for purple politics\n\nPolitical moderation is far more widespread than many suggest. Sarah Lawrence political scientist Sam Abrams, found, for example, that voters in the South are only slightly more conservative than those in the Northeast. Roughly as many consider themselves moderate as conservative, while a quarter describe themselves as liberal. Similarly, among residents of New England, long a bastion of progressives, barely 31 percent call themselves liberal while over a quarter identify as conservative and 43 percent moderate.\n\n\u201cSelf-described moderates control the balance of power in all regions,\u201d Abrams suggests. This is also the case, he notes, if you break down areas by rural, suburban and urban designations. Again, moderates dominate in virtually every category over both liberals and conservative.\n\nSo why extreme polarized politics?\n\nGiven these realities, how do we end up with choices, such as in 2016 and likely next year, that as Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse put it, are about as \u201cpopular as dumpster fires\u201d among voters?\n\nSome of the problem stems from record high alienation from the higher levels of government.\n\nBarely 18 percent of Americans, for example, believe the federal government will do the right thing, a pattern common across all regions. The more powerful and least accountable the institutions \u2014 the media, academia and big corporations \u2014 the higher the level of distrust.\n\nThis has left our national politics largely in the hands of zealots, both right and left, and those for whom politics is often a profitable business. These are the forces driving the committed to ever more ideological hysteria.\n\nZealots, and those who make their livings from serving them, do not favor political collaboration across party lines. Groups that rally to the far right and left don\u2019t want peaceful dialogue with dissenters. Indeed, the most intolerant of all our political \u201ctribes,\u201d notes one recent Atlantic study, are white social justice warriors, precisely the people who dominate the loud leftish Twitter fringe that drives the party base.\n\nThe Purple Tide could be just beginning\n\nIn contrast, purple politics would not exploit paranoia and hysteria but seek out practical answers to problems from transportation and housing to energy use and homelessness; it would follow essentially moderate policies that fit the largely suburban middle class.\n\nThis requires a new generation of leaders willing to break the ideological paralysis. Critically this includes the great GOP stronghold of Texas. In 2018 many longstanding Republican congressmen and other officials were defeated, as was nearly the polarizing Sen. Ted Cruz. To stem the bleeding, Republican strategist are seeking out more moderate, sensible politicians to deal with an increasingly purple electorate.\n\nFortunately for the Republicans in Texas, the Democrats seem to be accommodating this strategy by pushing the Texas party further to left, embracing such things as bans on fossil fuels, a mortal threat to their state\u2019s boom. Some, notably in Austin, have adopted policies on homelessness modeled on San Francisco\u2019s, with predictable results on the street that will make for fine GOP propaganda.\n\nThis hopefully temporary insanity manifests itself in onetime moderate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who now favors such things as reparations for those arrested for marijuana possession, open borders, as well as essentially nationalizing zoning, a position first embraced by his fellow Texas Democrat, Julian Castro. Between them, these once touted young political stars barely muster 15 percent of the Texas Democratic primary vote, according to a recent poll.\n\nGenerally, in gaining public approval, moderate GOP governors do best, and dominate the ranks of the most popular figures in American politics. In contrast, those at the bottom tend to be outspoken progressives, including Gov. Gavin Newsom and similarly left-leaning politicians such as last place finisher Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, although some particularly harsh conservatives, like Kentucky\u2019s Matt Bevin also do poorly.\n\nPolitical self-interest lies in the center\n\nPurple politics, sadly, is not doing well in the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential race. Elizabeth Warren, with her calls for a vast increase in federal power, as well higher taxes on the middle class, could drive a large number of middle-of-the-road and even working-class voters, including many minorities, to the GOP.\n\nAs the liberal columnist Jonathan Chait has observed, many new progressive stances now being adopted by Democrats \u2014 reparations, decriminalizing border crossings, health-care coverage to undocumented immigrants, eliminating energy production \u2014 are not likely to appeal to even moderate party members, much less independents.\n\nFor example, Medicare for all, embraced by Warren, is favored by barely 40 percent of the electorate. Proposals from Democratic candidates to eliminate private cars, end air travel and phase out red meat may not play well outside Manhattan, San Francisco and West Los Angeles. Already, notes The New York Times, the left shift is driving independents away from the party. Some 54 percent of all Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents prefer a more moderate than more liberal party.\n\nThe failures of more mainstream candidates, such as Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and John Hickenlooper, illustrate that the party\u2019s left is far better organized than the center. They appeal, according to a recent YouGov poll, to bread-and-butter issues built around the safety net, jobs and prosperity that moderate Democrats care about.\n\nBut the more motivated, and well-organized activists embrace a less saleable agenda of draconian climate-change policies, virtually unregulated abortion and removal of barriers to undocumented immigration. Only the embrace of such extreme and unpopular positions can save the presidency of the clearly unbalanced and deeply unpopular Donald Trump.\n\nYet purple politics may regain its appeal particularly if Trump is reelected. At some point, the political class will have to recognize that most people don\u2019t care much about \u201cconservative principles,\u201d \u201csaving the planet\u201d or massive schemes to assure \u201csocial justice\u201d on the backs of middle-class taxpayers. They want competent government, not politicians who only represent money interests and the organized yammerers within their parties.\n\nDespite the awful choice we are about to have at the top of the ticket, the good news that America is already essentially a purple country, dominated far more by moderation and common sense than the punditry suggests. What we need are political leaders capable of tapping into that reality, both for the own benefit and that of the country.\n\nThis piece first appeared at The Orange County Register.\n\nJoel Kotkin is the R.C.
