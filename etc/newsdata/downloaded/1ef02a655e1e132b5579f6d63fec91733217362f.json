I now want to represent my country at the international level and win the crown for India. My life story must inspire people. And I need to help my community break barriers.\u2019\n\nThe beauty queen, who identified as a trans woman in middle school, felt that being successful would make it easier for her parents to accept her.\n\nShe started her own beauty parlour, opened a restaurant, and educated herself. And now, her whole family stand by her.\n\n\u2018As a son, I completed my responsibilities,\u2019 she explained. \u2018That is when I decided to come out for the sake of my life and decided to step into the next phase.\n\n\u2018I came out to my sister in 2016 who was shocked and in tears. I told her about successful LGBTQ+ people, showed her videos and how many people are part of the community.\n\n\u2018She eventually told my mother who was depressed for a long time. But I told her that my strength lies in her and now, my entire family stands by me.\u2019\n\nNeetu is a successful tattoo artist and business owner (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nFounder of Miss Trans Queen India, Reena Rai explained why the pageant is more than just a beauty contest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018When I started this, I was all alone. My victory lies in the fact that all my queens are standing with me.\n\n\u2018These queens are not just about beauty but agents of change. They are doing work on the ground level.\n\n\u2018They are celebrating the success of their own trans sister. They now understand that a transwoman winner is not just an individual but a representative of the community.\u2019\n\nHere are some more images of Miss Trans Queen India 2019:\n\nFab colours (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nGlam squad (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nA quick nap among the activities (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nEnjoying a laugh backstage (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nA contestant takes photographs with Veena Sendre, Miss Transqueen India 2018 (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nStrike a pose (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nHigh fashion (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nTraditional round (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nTwo queens (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nBest gown round (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nBusy busy (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nGlam squad pt 2 (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nRunners up (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nContestants speak with Navya Singh (right), Miss Transqueen India brand ambassador (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nMore photoshoots (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nWinner and runner up from last year imparting their wisdom (Picture: EPA, Rajat Gupta)\n\nNeetu will now be entered in the Miss International Queen to be held in Thailand.
