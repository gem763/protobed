REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nBANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai exporters facing the loss of duty-free status for certain goods sold to the United States could incur losses of up to 1.8 billion baht ($59.68 million) per year, Commerce Minister Jurin Laksanavisit told reporters on Sunday.\n\nThe United States on Friday suspended duty-free treatment for $1.3 billion worth of Thai imports, including seafood products, under its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, saying Thailand did not \u201cafford workers in Thailand internationally recognized worker rights.\u201d\n\nThe tariffs that would take effect in six months would be 4-5% instead of zero, Jurin said.\n\n\u201cThai products that are sold in the U.S. will have a burden ... which comes to around 1.5 to 1.8 billion baht,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparately, Labor Minister Chatumongol Sonakul said Thailand is working on measures to ensure migrant worker rights, but that those would be based on Thai standards and laws.\n\n\u201cWe refer to international standards, but do not translate them into law,\u201d Chatumongol told reporters.\n\n\u201cOne of the issues is large unions \u2026 we don\u2019t want that - we have company unions,\u201d he said, adding there would be more negotiations but that migrant workers should not have more rights than Thai workers.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest producer of canned tuna and owner of the Chicken of the Sea brand, Thai Union Group Pcl (TU.BK), said in a statement that the move should not affect its products.\n\n\u201cThe decision will not have a material impact on Thai Union Group\u2019s business, as no seafood or pet food products sold into the U.S. from Thailand are currently covered by the GSP,\u201d it said.", "description": "Thai exporters facing the loss of duty-free status for certain goods sold to the United States could incur losses of up to 1.8 billion baht ($59.68 million) per year, Commerce Minister Jurin Laksanavisit told reporters on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445482117&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0CM", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
