The nature of the attacks are such that a dangerous finding is inevitable.\n\n\u201cThere is no alternative sentence that would provide protection to the public and therefore this court must impose a sentence of life imprisonment.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife\u201d sentences in the United Kingdom are somewhat disingenuously titled, however, as they almost never entail a so-called \u201cwhole life order\u201d, i.e. life in custody.\n\nInstead, they typically involve serving a relatively short minimum term behind bars, followed by a parole hearing and release back onto the streets with the mere possibility of being recalled to prison if certain terms and conditions are broken.\n\nThis is often too late to save victims from the supposed \u201clifers\u201d reoffending \u2014 for example, at least 51 people were killed by criminals previously convicted of homicide between 2009 and 2017.\n\nIn Desta\u2019s case, his minimum term in custody has been set at ten years \u2014 almost seven decades short of average male life expectancy in the country \u2014 and it is not even clear that he will finally be deported on release, with Judge Inman saying his \u201cstatus is not a matter to me.\u201d\n\nUK Govt to \u2018Resettle Thousands More Refugees Starting Next Year, for Years to Come\u2019 https://t.co/M4KGYyaVhj \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 20, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "A \"violent predatory rapist\" who came to Britain as a refugee has been convicted for roaming the country by train assaulting women.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/refugee-desta-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
