Don\u2019t get left behind. This is a fear that\u2019s prevalent across multiple industries, creating a gold rush for startups with spectacular ideas for the future \u2013 but not everyone can be Uber or Airbnb.\n\nThe billionaires of the future will be entrepreneurs who can solve a billion people\u2019s problems according to Mann, because innovation crosses the tipping point to mainstream when there really is a need.\n\nAs Laila Pawlak pointed out, from SingularityU Nordic, it all depends on what we spend our time on \u2013 the iBeer app which makes your phone look like you\u2019re drinking the golden liquid was downloaded 20 million times \u2013 no other species uses technology on such pointless endeavours.\n\nInstead we should be focusing on the world\u2019s most urgent to-do list \u2013 the UN Sustainable Development Goals. For Pawlak we have to rehumanise our technology, especially with the exponential development of computing power that\u2019s surpassing human brainpower that hasn\u2019t had an upgrade over thousands of years.\n\nWATCH: Robots finally replacing humans? Meet Tokyo's digital security guards\n\nBut are we building castles in the air?\n\n\u201cNever before has every one of us had the opportunity to change the path of where we end up,\u201d says Pawlak, \u201cit all depends what we decide to spend our time on when we wake up in the morning.\u201d\n\nAnother revolutionising technology that\u2019s ever-expanding is the mobile smartphone, says computer scientist and former director of programme management at Microsoft Ramez Naam. By 2025, there will be 500 million mobile internet users in Africa, the continent that\u2019s currently the least-connected in the world.\n\nBut this open space provides a lot of innovative thinking and opportunities for new ways to connect \u2013 which should be led by Africans themselves.\n\nLocal South African tech hero Stafford Masie \u2013 who helped forge a Google presence in Africa \u2013 is more focused on the practicality of tech rather than it looking \u2018pretty\u2019. Pushing machine learning into retail and calling artificial intelligence our \u2018superpowers\u2019, but inequality remains its weakness.\n\n\u201cWe hear about AI\u2019s negative impacts, but that\u2019s not because of AI, but because of a lack of imagination from humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not to do more with fewer humans \u2013 we need to do more by augmenting our human resources.\u201d\n\nALSO WATCH: First smiling AI robot sent to space to assist astronauts and be a companion\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
