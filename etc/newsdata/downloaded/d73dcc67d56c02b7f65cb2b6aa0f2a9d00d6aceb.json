What a roller coaster ride it\u2019s been!! We all had hopes and dreams when we were younger... doesn\u2019t always play out the way you hoped but my goodness things all happed for a reason, to be where I am today, to be the person I am today!!\n\n'Forever and eternally grateful for being given the most amazing experience of life. They\u2019ve had ups and they\u2019ve had downs and each and every high and low made me who I am today! Forever blessed! I\u2019m where I\u2019m supposed to be!\n\n'If my story helps change and helps others over come whatever challenges they are going through in life then it\u2019s all been worth it!!

Kerry Katona has revealed that the company responsible for her latest round of cosmetic treatments is naming a package deal after her\n\nThe ad showed a picture of Kerry (albeit with the top half of her head cropped off) along with the offer of '2ml face filler and 1 area of fat dissolving \u00a3699'.\n\nComments began rolling in from her followers, with one posting: 'What bulls**t!!!! You got it free!'\n\nAnother ranted: 'Not great for some of your younger audiences or fans really......!'\n\nSomeone else posted: 'Ordinary workers cant afford this Kerry!'\n\n'That\u2019s REALLY expensive. Lots of places are much cheaper than that for the same results!' someone else posted.\n\n'What an absolute disappointment! Didn't think you would promote this in such an unethical way! By all means do what you need to do to make yourself feel good, but please bare in mind the bad influence you promote to your younger followers,' penned another fan.\n\nCriticism: This was met with a major backlash from her fans, who commented that it was very expensive and sending a negative message to her young followers\n\nFollowed by someone else who penned: 'Usually love your posts and I've followed you for years but I'm actually shocked that u are promoting this. Why are u not telling people that follow you that there natural beauty is enough and that they don't need to spend a fortune or go under the knife to feel better about themselves?'\n\nA rep for Kerry has been approached for comment.\n\nThis promotion comes days after Kerry was admitted to A&E for unknown reasons - not long after sharing a video of herself getting filler injections in the comfort of her own home.\n\nShe added a caption: 'So today I had the beautiful ladies from @harleycosmeticlondon come and enhance my natural beauty.\n\n'Now I know half of you are gonna have a go and say something like me being a role model blah blah but I honestly don\u2019t think this is any different to heavy make up if it\u2019s done properly!!\n\n'I\u2019m 40 next year and just had a full M.O.T on me face!!! And I\u2019m loving the results.. thank you ladies.'\n\nMakeover: Kerry recently showed off the results of her newly applied lip and chin fillers.
