December arabica KCc2 rose 0.2 cent, or 0.2%, to 95.60 cents per lb, still some way off a five-month low of 93.40 cents set on Aug. 20.\n\n* Weakness in Brazil's real currency has weighed on arabica of late, but the market is due to see less excess supply as Brazil moves into an off-year crop cycle, where tired trees flower less.\n\nSUGAR\n\n* October raw sugar fell 0.02 cent, or 0.2%, to 10.94 cents per lb, having hit 10.86 cents earlier, its weakest since late September 2018.\n\n* October white sugar , which expires at the end of next week, was down $0.5, or 0.2%, at $302.00 per tonne, having hit its weakest since mid-July at $300.20 on Thursday.\n\n* Dealers said nearby supplies remain ample and large deliveries were expected both against the whites and the raws contract, which expires at the end of this month.\n\n* \"At the moment the outlook continues to be bearish. The next target on flat price looks like 10.43,\" said Nick Penney, senior trader at Sucden.\n\n* The sugar market is widely expected to move into deficit next season, but it faces a huge buildup of stocks near term in India and Thailand.\n\nCOCOA\n\n* December New York cocoa CCc2 fell $9, or 0.4%, to $2,236 per tonne.\n\n* The market continues to regain some ground, with rains in top producer Ivory Coast prompting some concerns about quality. A large Ivory Coast crop is still expected overall.\n\n* December LCCc2 was down 2 pounds, or 0.1%, at 1,735 pounds a tonne.", "description": "SOFTS-Robusta coffee near 9-year low as Vietnam sellers face pressure to fix prices", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Coffee_800x533_L_1421322850.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
