The morning after Brexit day, Britain will still find itself located next to a huge trading bloc with increasingly state-like structures.\n\nU.K. politicians are scrambling to lay blame on the EU for the ever-increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, but they have failed to grasp a key aspect of life outside the EU: London will soon be more reliant on the bloc\u2019s goodwill than ever before \u2014 especially in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIf the U.K. leaves the EU without a deal on October 31 \u2014 which Johnson has insisted he is prepared to do, despite the House of Commons voting to stop him \u2014 U.K. politicians will have to pause their EU-bashing, and humbly beg Brussels to put in place a raft of measures averting the worst economic effects of a messy exit. These would be mitigating measures the EU can terminate at any time.\n\nSimply put, few in the U.K. have come to terms with what becoming a neighboring state of the EU will mean in practice.\n\nThe promise of Brexit \u2014 peddled by Johnson and his chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, during the 2016 campaign \u2014 was to give British voters sole control over the U.K.\u2019s future. In truth, it means giving up a significant source of control: The ability to block European policies that might contradict British interests.\n\nJust ask the EU\u2019s other neighbors.\n\nBrussels, it turns out, has a long reach. EU laws have a ripple effect on countries that neighbor the bloc, as they force non-EU governments to adjust the way they organize their borders, laws and trading practices to ensure they can maintain access to the Brussels-led single market.\n\nAfter Brexit, the U.K. \u2014 much like Turkey, Serbia, Algeria or Ukraine \u2014 will find itself in a position of having to adapt to whatever legal changes happen at an EU level, with no control over how these decisions are made.\n\nAnd if the experience of current neighboring states is any indication, maintaining a relationship with the EU that also serves your national interests is no easy feat.\n\nFor countries like Norway and Switzerland, the ability to sustain a close and stable relationship with Brussels depends entirely on politicians and voters believing it\u2019s in their best interest to do so. Current tensions between Switzerland, where Euroskepticism is on the rise, and Brussels are a good example of how quickly a breakdown of political consensus can destabilize that relationship.\n\nFor some countries, including Tunisia, Albania and North Macedonia, access to the EU is so crucial for business they are willing to accept oversight from Brussels. In the case of Turkey, the level of interdependence with the EU is so high that Ankara has agreed to keep a shared customs union and effectively freeze Turkey\u2019s accession process, despite deep tensions over hot-button issues such as Kurdish diaspora politics and border management.\n\nBritish Brexiteers and quite a few Remainers still seem mesmerized by visions of a powerful Britain with an undamaged political and diplomatic status in Europe.\n\nRussia, too, has been forced to sustain its engagement with EU institutions, as a result of its energy and export sectors\u2019 dependence on European markets.\n\nBritain will not be able to escape a similar fate.\n\nNor will a no-deal scenario be a get-out-of-jail-free card. On November 1, the U.K. would no longer be bound to the EU by any formal agreement but it would immediately become dependent on Brussels for cooperation in mitigating the worst of the disruption to trade, the economy and its borders.\n\nGiven that the EU could turn its back on the U.K. at any time, British politicians, officials and businesses will face many of the same diplomatic and political dilemmas as their counterparts in countries like Turkey, Serbia or Iceland.\n\nBritish Brexiteers and quite a few Remainers still seem mesmerized by visions of a powerful Britain with an undamaged political and diplomatic status in Europe. These dreams are increasingly divorced from the U.K.\u2019s real geopolitical position.\n\nThe U.K. is not exchanging its EU membership for more control. It is giving it up for a spot in the EU\u2019s sphere of influence.\n\nAlexander Clarkson is a lecturer in European studies at King\u2019s College London.", "description": "Leaving the engine room of EU policymaking doesn\u2019t mean sailing off happily on your own.", "authors": ["Alexander Clarkson", "Charlie Cooper", "Emilio Casalicchio", "Annabelle Dickson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1166065876-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
