Sexism and abuse against women? Meet Bill Clinton and Harvey Weinstein. Racism? Meet the blackface donning Gov. Ralph Northam and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump pressuring Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election? Meet the Democrats in May 2018. Yes, the very same Democrats who are now supposedly aghast that President Trump asked the president of Ukraine to look into Joe Biden's family corruption, actually sent Ukraine a letter saying \"U.S. assistance\" was at stake unless the Ukrainian government complied with the bogus special counsel Robert Mueller investigation and conducted their own investigation into the president and his former aid Paul Manafort. Marc Theissen of the Washington Post brought this up yesterday, and after seeing what the president actually said to his call to the newly elected president Volodymyr Zelensky, it looks like the Democrats have nothing but egg on their face.\n\nHere's what Theissen reported Tuesday:\n\nIt got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) wrote a letter to Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as \u201cstrong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,\u201d the Democratic senators declared, \u201cWe have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,\u201d before demanding Lutsenko \u201creverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.\u201d So, it\u2019s okay for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it\u2019s not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?\n\nThe senators in question are defending their actions.\n\n\"So, so wrong. Again. Our letter was about concern **EVEN IN 2018** about WH pressure on Ukraine, to benefit you personally. And unlike you, we have strongly and consistently supported assistance to Ukraine as it struggles with Russian aggression. @SenatorMenendez @SenatorDurbin,\" Sen. Leahy tweeted.\n\nSo, so wrong.

Patrick Leahy (@SenatorLeahy) September 25, 2019\n\nBut that seems like a flimsy excuse. The letter clearly shows they were threatening to withhold assistance unless the Ukrainian government did as they demanded. Between this uncovered letter and former Vice President Joe Biden bragging about intimidating the Ukrainian prosecutor, this whole thing is boomeranging on the Dems. Here comes Trump 2020, folks, steamrolling into the White House (again).", "description": ".09/25/2019 19:24:07PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/199/778f6c42-39a5-4f93-991e-3f8b70a7a11b.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
