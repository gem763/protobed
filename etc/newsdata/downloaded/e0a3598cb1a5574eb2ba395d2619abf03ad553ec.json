Under the country\u2019s legal system, once the Supreme Court reaches a similar decision in five separate cases, the standard set by the rulings applies to the country\u2019s entire court system.\n\nAs the Associated Press explained, \u201cThe rulings technically do not legalize recreational use, however. They establish that courts must allow it, but it is still up to each individual to press his or her case in the judicial system.\u201d The rulings apply to possession, use, and growing \u2014 not commercialization or sales.\n\nThe Supreme Court \u201cfound that adults have a fundamental right to personal development which lets them decide their recreational activities without interference from the state,\u201d the AP reported. The right is not absolute, and it does not apply to all substances \u2014 but it does mean that total marijuana prohibition is unconstitutional.\n\nPrimera Sala reiter\u00f3 inconstitucionalidad de la prohibici\u00f3n absoluta del consumo recreativo de marihuana. Lo que permiti\u00f3 integrar jurisprudencia sobre el tema. pic.twitter.com/1p9stESEYn \u2014 Suprema Corte (@SCJN) November 1, 2018\n\nMexican lawmakers could react to the ruling by adjusting the law to regulate marijuana under the new legal framework set by the Supreme Court. Officials in President-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government have indicated that they may legalize marijuana, Reuters reported.\n\nIf Mexico\u2019s government follows through, the country could become the third in the world to legalize pot for recreational purposes \u2014 after Uruguay and Canada.\n\nAlthough nine states in the US have legalized marijuana for recreational purposes, pot is still illegal under federal law in America.\n\nSupporters of legalization argue that it eliminates the harms of marijuana prohibition: the arrests over a relatively harmless drug (and the racial disparities involved in America), and the billions of dollars that flow from the black market for marijuana to drug cartels that then use the money for violent operations around the world. All of this, legalization advocates say, will outweigh any of the potential downsides \u2014 like increased cannabis use \u2014 that might come with legalization.\n\nOpponents, meanwhile, claim that legalization will enable a huge marijuana industry that will market the drug irresponsibly. They point to countries\u2019 experiences with the alcohol and tobacco industries, which have built their financial empires in large part on some of the heaviest consumers of their products. This could result in far more people using pot, even if it leads to negative health consequences.\n\nAt least in Mexico, the supporters won a big victory this week.\n\nFor more on marijuana legalization, read Vox\u2019s explainer.", "description": "Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court deemed the marijuana prohibition law unconstitutional.", "authors": ["German Lopez", "Sigal Samuel", "Shirin Ghaffary", "Ian Millhiser", "Zack Beauchamp", "Nov"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FWtH9_Tc5izBogCcncbhRupRAOY=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13370405/57299333.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-01"}
