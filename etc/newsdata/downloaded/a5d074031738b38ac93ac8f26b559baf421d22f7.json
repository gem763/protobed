There is a grand-jury redaction in that passage, the lawyers note.\n\n\u201cThe text redacted ... and any underlying evidence to which it may point are critical to the committee\u2019s investigation,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cThose materials therefore have direct bearing on whether the president was untruthful, and further obstructed the special counsel\u2019s investigation, when in providing written responses to the special counsel\u2019s questions he denied being aware of any communications between his campaign and WikiLeaks,\u201d they added.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.
