We bring home about $90,000 a year. In addition to this, we have almost $60,000 in equity in our home. We also have a toddler, plus another baby on the way. Do you think we should sell the house, and rent for a few years, while using the money from the sale of the house to pay down our student loan debt?\n\nChris\n\nDear Chris,\n\nNo, I wouldn\u2019t sell your home in this situation. You\u2019re going to be out of debt in a couple of years or so, anyway. You\u2019ll just have to lean into it, and make sure you\u2019re living on a strict, written budget. I\u2019m talking about no vacations, and no eating out. You shouldn\u2019t see the inside of a restaurant unless you\u2019re working there. And the new kid\u2019s crib may have to come from a garage sale, but so what? Mine did, too. Want to know something else? I survived without having a rich kid\u2019s nursery, and so did my kids.\n\nThere\u2019s a price to be paid anytime you decide to get serious about gaining control of your money and cleaning up a financial mess you\u2019ve made. You\u2019re going to have to work like maniacs and have no lives for a while. That might even mean picking up a part-time job at night or on weekends. You\u2019ve got a tough couple of years ahead of you, but I think it\u2019s worth the tradeoff.\n\nKeep your house.\n\n\u2014Dave", "description": "Dear Dave,My wife and I are on Baby Step 2, .09/02/2019 3:20:51AM EST.", "authors": ["Dave Ramsey", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/166/5843b606-792a-4bee-8733-b7d67ca227a5.jpg"}
