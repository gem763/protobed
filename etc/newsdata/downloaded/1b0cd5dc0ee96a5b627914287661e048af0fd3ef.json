But the rise in concern has largely come from Democrats. Opinions among Republicans on this issue remain largely unchanged.\n\nAmong Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents overall, 84% say climate change is a major threat to the country\u2019s well-being as of July 2019, up from 58% in a March 2013 survey. Views among Republicans and Republican leaners have stayed about the same (27% in 2019 vs. 22% in 2013).\n\nNearly all liberal Democrats (94%, including independents who lean to the party) consider climate change a major threat to the nation now, up 30 percentage points from 2013. Three-quarters of moderate/conservative Democrats say the same, up from 54% in 2013.\n\nBy contrast, there has been no significant change among either moderate or conservative Republicans on this issue. (While the share of moderate/liberal Republicans who see climate change as a major threat is up 9 percentage points since 2013, this change is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.)\n\nThe partisan trend is similar on a related question. More Americans said in January 2019 that dealing with global climate change should be a top priority for Congress and the president (44%) than did so in early 2015 (34%). But the increased interest in prioritizing climate policy stems from Democrats, not Republicans.\n\nTwo-thirds of Democrats (67%), including 83% of liberal Democrats, said this year that dealing with global climate change should be a top priority for the president and Congress. This was up from 46% of Democrats in 2015.\n\nIn contrast, about two-in-ten Republicans (21%) said this year that climate change should be a top priority \u2013 a virtually identical share as in 2015 (19%).\n\nClimate change policy is among the issues taking center stage for Democrats seeking their party\u2019s nomination. A 2018 survey by the Center found 82% of registered Democrats said the issue of the environment would be very important in their vote, up from 69% just two years earlier. The role of such issues in the general election remains unclear. The same 2018 survey found 38% of registered Republicans saying the environment would be very important to their vote, roughly the same share as a decade earlier.", "description": "The share of Americans calling global climate change a major threat to the U.S. has grown since 2013, an increase that has occurred largely among Democrats.", "authors": ["Brian Kennedy", "Meg Hefferon"], "top_image": "https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FT_19.08.27_ClimateChange_feature.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
