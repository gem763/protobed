I'm sure you've noticed this if you've watched Queen's 70s concerts.\n\n(Image: ullstein bild via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"The thorns of these long-stemmed red roses would have been plucked out one by one by a crew member because Freddie didn't want anybody to get hurt in any way.\"\n\nThis was all very well until one in night in Bristol, when there were palpitations backstage as the roses were nowhere to be seen.\n\nIt was during Queen's 1975 tour for album A Night At The Opera that near disaster struck and Freddie's tradition almost died.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images)\n\nA newspaper story at the time revealed: \"While Freddie, Bryan, John and Roger were on stage performing, someone backstage discovered that the roses Freddie throws to the audience during the final number were missing.\n\n\"Unseen by the ecstatic audience, a member of Queen\u2019s slipped out of the audience and, with the aid of a policeman, raced off in a car, its lights flashing, to find a garden with roses.\n\n\"They managed to find a fresh bunch for Freddie to shower on the fans. That is dedication. And because of it, Queen are all set for a long, long reign.\u201d\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nWhile the acquisition of the fresh flowers seemed innocent enough in the report, one fansite reported that they may have come from somewhere a little more surprising that first thought.\n\nAccording to another fansite: \"The roses mentioned in the article that Freddie threw into the audience were actually stolen from a local cemetery.\"\n\nWell, Freddie liked to be a little naughty and while pilfering from a cemetery may not be exactly what he would endorse, he would no doubt have seen the funny side as to how his end of gig tradition was kept alive.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
