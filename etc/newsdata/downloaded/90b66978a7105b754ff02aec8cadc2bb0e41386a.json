Even by their colors \u2014 reds and blues mostly. As the saying goes \u201cNobody ever got fired for buying [suite vendor].\u201d\n\nThey sell a vision of a suite of user-level tools that can solve the problems of a marketing and content professionals in a seamless way \u2014 from web content management to e-commerce to analytics. It makes sense in theory \u2014 you\u2019ve got one big name that you can trust, and because everything falls under the same brand and works on the same infrastructure. The digital experience should work seamlessly. You and I know it doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe truth is \u2014 these suites are built from years (and even decades) of acquisitions, and despite the billions invested, they are the direct opposite of every suite\u2019s favorite seam-free buzzword. What\u2019s even worse is that they\u2019re in no way a universal solution to the diverse needs of businesses \u2013 they fail you in cost, in complexity, and in features.\n\nHow does this manifest on the customer side? Well, say you\u2019re a large consumer products with many brands. A single stack suite including a web-based CMS, personalization, marketing automation, and so on isn\u2019t going to be able to deliver the corporate website, run your fleet of microsites, run your e-commerce storefronts, and all of your other requirements in a scalable way, from a cost or governance standpoint.\n\nSoftware licenses, SaaS subscriptions, or development models that are a fit for one use case or team won\u2019t be when multiplied by 100 or 1000. Further, organizational structures (including politics, preferred partnerships, and regional requirements) rarely facilitate a one-size-fits-all technology consensus.\n\nReal organizations have complex needs, and those needs are solved by solutions that scale to fit: WordPress blogs, Adobe Experience Manager for the .com, and Drupal for the community sites. Multiply that times 10s or 1000s of sites, and what you end up with is chaos, as each solution is usually deployed in a vertically oriented stack, separate from the others. That\u2019s where Shadow IT has festered \u2014 software installed and used to run an organization without the organization necessarily knowing.\n\nWe need to change course\n\nIt\u2019s time for anyone building a company to give up on multi-service software vendors. It\u2019s time to admit that you cannot expect companies to actually offer a one-size-fits-all suite. Instead, IT and digital business leaders can forge a win-win partnership, by looking further down the stack for their platform for success.\n\nTechnology leaders can win by providing access to a range of solutions for digital engagement \u2014 including open source and licensed software \u2014 delivered on a common platform. At this platform level, they can standardize best practices in DevOps, security, compliance, and access control, and provide developers in business teams with the \u201cprimitives,\u201d or building blocks, for delivering the applications their markets need.\n\nProviding standardized ways of consuming databases, configuring applications, and accessing cloud services like storage and routing can not only save costs, but gives business teams a win, with greater agility and innovation as they no longer have to either manage these stacks on their own, or invest in outside vendors to do so. They can also choose the frameworks and languages that work best for their use case, budget, and team skills and structure.\n\nThe biggest reward comes from the next level of platform building: self-service. When consuming primitives becomes simple, and development teams can access them without intervention of central IT, Shadow IT fades away.\n\nBusiness teams can iterate and innovate faster because they\u2019re focusing on shipping great product (be it campaigns, content, features, etc.) to their users rather than running their own operations or trying shoehorn a single vendor\u2019s suite into each and every use case. All the while, the organization benefits from a reduced surface area for security and compliance risk.", "description": "You've got a big name that you can trust, and the digital experience should work seamlessly due to the shared infrastructure.
