By early May, their relationship had turned 'more intimate,' according to the court documents cited by The State.\n\nWhen the girl's father became aware of her online exchanges with Aliff on September 2, he took his daughter\u2019s phone away, but the two continued communicating on a tablet, according to the FBI.\n\nIn the course of their chats, Aliff and the girl allegedly made plans for the woman to pick up the child in South Saint Paul, Minnesota, and drive her to Greenville.\n\nAliff is accused of driving more than 1,000 from Greenville, South Carolina, to Saint Paul, Minnesota, to pick up a girl younger than 12 and take her back to her home for sex\n\nAccording to the court documents, the 23-year-old made good on that plan and on the morning of September 7 picked up the girl near her home in Saint Paul, after covering a distance of 1,100 miles.\n\nThe pair then got back on the road and traveled back to Aliff's home in Greenville, after driving through Wisconsin and Kentucky.\n\nAccording to the FBI, Aliff attempted to cover her tracks and avoid detection by dunking her phone in a cup of coffee.\n\nThe girl allegedly helped with the task of destroying the device by stabbing it repeatedly with a knife, according to the records.\n\nUpon reaching her apartment in Greenville on September 8, Aliff allegedly introduced 'Jane Doe' to her roommate as a friend.\n\nWhen the roommate left, Aliff and the minor drank beer and took a bath together, at which time the two engaged in sexual activity, the documents state.\n\nWhen the feds came to arrest Aliff, she was found wearing only a tank top in bed with the victim, who was completely nude\n\nAliff later allegedly described the victim to FBI agents 'as a little bit loose \u2018cause of the alcohol.'\n\nThe woman and the child then moved to the bedroom where the alleged sexual assault continued, according to the records.\n\nWhen federal agents came to arrest her, the 23-year-old was wearing only a tank top, while the victim was completely naked in bed.\n\nAliff is being held at the notorious Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, where accused pedophile Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in August.
