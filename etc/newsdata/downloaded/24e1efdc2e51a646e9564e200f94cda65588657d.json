If you want to drain the swamp, make sure the swamp creatures understand that they could have their corruption exposed and won\u2019t be allowed to threaten the witness when they do. Joseph Maguire specifically promised at this morning\u2019s hearing, in fact, that he wouldn\u2019t tolerate any retaliation against whoever wrote the whistleblower complaint on Ukraine.\n\nSo here\u2019s the president casually hinting to a roomful of people today that the people responsible for supplying the information for the complaint would have been executed if America was great again. And not just any roomful of people. He was addressing U.S. diplomatic staff \u2014 people who are in a position themselves to be whistleblowers potentially if they witness misconduct.\n\nImagine being a Senate Republican who\u2019s already feeling queasy about the impeachment fight now having to defend this. You\u2019re grasping for arguments that the president\u2019s intentions on Ukraine and the Bidens weren\u2019t sinister. And suddenly he\u2019s like wait until I get my hands on whoever reported this\u2026\n\nThe remark stunned people in the audience, according to a person briefed on what took place, who had notes of what the president said. Mr. Trump made the statement about several minutes into his remarks before the group of about 50 people at the event intended to honor the United States Mission. At the outset, he condemned the former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s role in Ukraine at a time when his son Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company\u2026 \u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person who gave the whistle-blower the information because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\u2026 Some in the crowd laughed, the person briefed on what took place said. The event was closed to reporters, and during his remarks, the president called the news media \u201cscum\u201d in addition to labeling them as crooked.\n\nThat reminded me of a vivid quote from a story I read last night about the political bind congressional Republicans are in over the Ukraine matter:\n\nMonths ago, one House member from a firmly red district described feeling like the most wanted man in his state after he made a vote Trump didn\u2019t like. \u201cTrump has said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone dead and and not lose any supporters,\u201d said the member. \u201cWell, if that happens I\u2019d better be photographed stuffing a body into the trunk of a car, or my constituents will demand to know why I\u2019m not supporting the president.\u201d\n\nCould the president shoot a whistleblower on Fifth Avenue and not lose a single vote? We\u2019ll find out.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to say \u201cugh\u201d about his remarks to staff at the UN Mission and then move on but Democrats are eager for material to add to their impeachment case against him. Openly threatening the whistleblower and/or his sources is arguably obstruction of justice. After all, the officials who gave information to the whistleblower about Trump and Ukraine might eventually be called to testify before Congress to substantiate the allegations in the complaint. The president\u2019s now on record as saying that he regards them as little better than spies. The federal law on witness tampering prohibits knowingly using \u201cintimidation\u201d with intent to prevent a witness from testifying. Democrats are probably going to toss this into the articles of impeachment and call it separate and independent grounds to impeach. What will Republicans say?\n\nYeah, I know: \u201cHe was joking.\u201d People laughed, right?\n\nIs it even clear from the whistleblower complaint, by the way, that the sources meant to blow the whistle on Trump? The impression I got from it isn\u2019t that they were feeding information to the author in the hope and expectation that he would take it to Congress. It was more \u201ccan you believe this?\u201d gossip, with no intention that it would be made public. After all, if they wanted the information out there, they could have written their own complaints or leaked it to the media ages ago. As it is, it\u2019s unclear (and even doubtful) that they did anything illegal by sharing what they knew with the author. I wonder if Trump focused on them instead of the whistleblower himself in what he said about \u201cspies\u201d because it\u2019s already been drummed into him by his lawyers that he shouldn\u2019t say anything threatening about the author of the complaint. He needed to vent, he couldn\u2019t vent legally about his chief antagonist without making much more trouble for himself, so he decided to scapegoat the people who supplied the whistleblower with information rather than the person who went public with it.\n\nJohn has a post coming up about the Times\u2019s new story this afternoon reporting key details about the whistleblower\u2019s identity. I don\u2019t want to step on that so I won\u2019t say anything about it here except to note that the paper is under fire for publishing it for an understandable reason. Chew on this:\n\nIt does seem like the incentives for whistleblowing are a bit perverse, because if you do it the proper, legal way, you become fairer game for journalists to identify you, whereas if you just leak the same stuff to journalists, we\u2019ll generally conceal the source and protect you. https://t.co/UGossMOfxR \u2014 Matt Pearce \ud83e\udd85 (@mattdpearce) September 26, 2019\n\nThe famous op-ed written by an anti-Trump member of the government \u2014 \u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration\u201d \u2014 is now more than a year old and its author remains unknown to this day, a secret successfully kept by the op-ed editors of the New York Times.
