But with massive, massive surprises that even had me like, \u201cOh, wow!\u201d So I think we\u2019re going to really shock people.\u2019\n\nShe continued to GQ Hype we may see a freshly emotional Bond, who is perhaps shirking the overly masculine caricature of the past\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I would say that he\u2019s reconnected with his heart. We\u2019re de\ufb01nitely seeing a Bond who\u2019s more in touch with his feelings and more open to falling in love,\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018At the end of Spectre there are women he gives his career up for: there\u2019s no more emotional attachment than that. It\u2019s just about moving with the times and recognising that women can no longer be seen as eye candy.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nIt follows her earlier comments on the legendary fictional master, as she said at the May GQ Heroes summit: \u2018The Bond of old, his days are numbered.\u2019\n\nNaomie is fast becoming a household name thanks to her roles in the Bond films, and after being nominated for the best supporting actress award for her role in Moonlight\n\n\u2018I expected [Moonlight] to make a difference but not on the level it has,\u2019 she revealed.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s completely changed my career. It\u2019s changed how many offers I\u2019ve got, the fee I can command, my standing in the industry, the respect I get given. It\u2019s huge. I wouldn\u2019t have been offered something of the exposure of Black And Blue before Moonlight.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe won\u2019t have to wait as long for Bond to hit screens, by the way, after the release date was moved forward.\n\nBy a day.\n\nThe film was originally scheduled to hit cinemas on 3 April in the UK and 8 April in the US, but has been bought forward a day by producers.\n\nThe new release date was revealed on global James Bond Day which also saw the release of a new poster, showing Daniel looking all kinds of moody in Bond\u2019s signature tux and gazing intensely at something in the distance.\n\nWe\u2019ll know what that something is in a few short months.\n\nNo Time To Die is in UK cinemas 2 April 2020.\n\nRead the full interview on GQ Hype.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
