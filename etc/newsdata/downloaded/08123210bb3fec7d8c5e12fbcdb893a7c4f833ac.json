If you think you should challenge the man who is the leader of your party, you need to make sure that at the very least your sins aren\u2019t the same as his sins.\n\nThe second thing you need is a plan. You are trying to wrest control of your party away from someone you think is a lunatic, so you need to have some basic rough draft of a plan put together that you can present and say \u201cThis is how we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d\n\nThe third thing you need is at least a snowball\u2019s chance in hell.\n\nAt no point in any of the musings, writings, or statements of Mark Sanford does he confirm that he has these three things. If he had, it would have been a lie, because he does not.\n\nIt simply would not be fair to write a column about Sanford solely making fun of his own sins, which he has apologized to the public for and sought atonement for. However, his past sins to make going after Trump significantly harder.\n\nAfter all, Trump has openly bragged about his affairs and has never shied away from them. His early life story was built on his successes with women as much as it was his successes in real estate. It was something that people just expected of him, which is largely why the news of the Stormy Daniels affairs never really hurt him in any way with his supporters.\n\nSanford, however, carried on an affair in secret and used taxpayer money in the process of carrying his affair on. He did it to hide the affair from his family and his constituency. He spent time lying about it because he knew it was wrong and knew that people would judge him for it.\n\nIf a large part of your argument against Trump is about the respectability and decency of the office, then the above paragraph alone is probably enough to disqualify you. But that isn\u2019t the extent of the problems Sanford will face as a primary challenger.\n\nThere is no plan for Sanford to take any noticeable votes from Trump. No path he can take to pose a threat to the president. He hasn\u2019t offered one, and short of harnessing the votes of an alternate universe, there is no way to create one. Trump has the base firmly on his side, so Sanford can\u2019t take any of that, and his own past makes it unlikely that other wavering Republicans would look elsewhere.\n\nDemocrats certainly won\u2019t choose him. Independents are already trying to decide if they can go with Biden or side with Trump if an absolute trainwreck of a socialist (see: Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders) gets nominated. The worst-case scenario is that they just stay home. They won\u2019t vote for a longshot Republican challenger like Sanford.\n\nHe is also going up against a raving lunatic of a radio host who was a raving lunatic of a Trump supporter early on (Joe Walsh) and the only man I\u2019ve ever seen in a presidential election actually have less than zero energy (Bill Weld). If these three are the best that the anti-Trump Republicans can come up with, then they are foolish and would be better served if they just left the party and went elsewhere (Britain maybe? I hear they need some new conservative voices).\n\nIf Sanford isn\u2019t running solely to lift his name ID or sell a book, then he\u2019s a delusional maniac. There is nothing for him on the path he\u2019s chose to take.", "description": "Mark Sanford Is Probably Not The Right Guy To Challenge Trump", "authors": ["Joe Cunningham", "Alex Parker", "Posted At Am On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AP695944808985.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
