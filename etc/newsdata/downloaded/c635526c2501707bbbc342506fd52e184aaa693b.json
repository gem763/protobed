That's the way forward.\"\n\nCorbyn told reporters that he would wait to see what the EU decides on a Brexit delay before saying which way his party would vote on Johnson's offer of an election.\n\n\"The principle is: take no-deal off the table, EU answers tomorrow, then we can decide,\" Corbyn said. \"If the EU will answer tomorrow then we'll know tomorrow.\"\n\nOther opposition parties also rejected the offer, casting doubt over its chances of success.\n\nJust a week before the country was due to leave the EU, the bloc looks set to grant Johnson a Brexit delay, something he has repeatedly said he does not want but was forced to request by the country's divided Parliament.\n\nI have written to Jeremy Corbyn: this Parliament must get Brexit done now or a NEW Parliament must get Brexit done so the country can move on <a href=\"https://t.co/PekfFRsR9F\">pic.twitter.com/PekfFRsR9F</a> \u2014@BorisJohnson\n\nAn election is seen by his team as the only way of breaking the deadlock over Brexit after Parliament voted in favour of his deal but then, just minutes later, rejected his preferred timetable which would have met his Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nBut he has twice failed before to win the votes in Parliament for an election, where he needs the support of two-thirds of its 650 lawmakers, as per the Fixed Term Parliaments Act of 2011.\n\n\"This Parliament has refused to take decisions. It cannot refuse to let the voters replace it with a new Parliament that can make decisions,\" he wrote to Corbyn.\n\n\"Prolonging this paralysis into 2020 would have dangerous consequences for businesses, jobs and for basic confidence in democratic institutions, already badly damaged by the behaviour of Parliament since the referendum. Parliament cannot continue to hold the country hostage.\"\n\nIn Parliament after the government announced the new vote on an election for Monday, Labour's parliamentary business manager Valerie Vaz did not say whether the party would back the move, saying only it would wait to see what the EU says about a delay on Friday.\n\nMore than three years after voting 52 per cent to 48 per cent to be the first sovereign country to leave the EU, the future of Brexit is as unclear as ever, with Britain still debating when, how or even whether it should go ahead.\n\nJohnson won the top job in July by staking his career on getting Brexit done by Oct. 31, though in the letter he makes clear he is ready to scrap his deadline. Last month, he said he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than ask for a delay.\n\nAn anti-Brexit sign is seen outside Parliament earlier this week. A potentially long Brexit delay could open up the possibility of another referendum on leaving the EU. (Simon Dawson/Reuters)\n\nBut several of his aides think he can weather any criticism for failing to meet the deadline at an election by arguing that he was thwarted by lawmakers, doubling down on his team's narrative of pitting the \"people versus the Parliament.\"\n\nAt a meeting of his political cabinet of top ministers, some media reported that there was disagreement over whether the government should try for an early election, fearing that going to the polls before Brexit was settled might damage the governing Conservatives.\n\nBut Johnson seems to still hold out hope of securing a deal with Brussels, offering Parliament until Nov. 6 to ratify an agreement he settled with the EU last week.\n\n\"This means that we could get Brexit done before the election on 12 December if MPs choose to do so.\"\n\nLabour has long said it cannot back an election until a so-called no-deal Brexit is off the table. But if the EU grants an extension until the end of January, that would appear to remove the threat of Johnson taking Britain out of the bloc without an agreement.\n\nBy proposing to dissolve Parliament on Nov. 6, that would also be beyond the current Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nLength of delay still undetermined\n\nAll eyes are now on not whether, but by how long, the EU decides to extend the Brexit process: Berlin supports a three-month delay, while Paris is pushing for a shorter one.\n\nWhile both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron appear to be fatigued by Brexit, they fear a no-deal exit that would almost certainly hurt global growth, roil financial markets and create a potentially deeper EU crisis.\n\nTo offer a long extension would take the pressure off British lawmakers to approve Johnson's deal and open up possibilities such as a referendum on it. A short extension might focus minds in the British Parliament.\n\nBrexit was initially supposed to have taken place on March 29 but Johnson's predecessor Theresa May was forced to delay twice \u2014 first to April 12 and then to Oct. 31 \u2014 as Parliament defeated her Brexit deal by margins of between 58 and 230 votes earlier this year.\n\nJohnson was forced by Parliament on Saturday to send a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk requesting a delay until Jan. 31. He did so reluctantly, sending an unsigned photocopied note, but the correspondence was accepted.", "description": "U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday called for a general election on Dec. 12 to break the\u00a0Brexit impasse, conceding for the first time he will not meet his \"do or die\" deadline to leave the European Union next week.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5333875.1571939112!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1177954398.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
