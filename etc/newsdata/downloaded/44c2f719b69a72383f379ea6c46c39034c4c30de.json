(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nAn Elizabeth Warren administration would use its regulatory power to implement a flood of market-rattling moves on everything from antitrust enforcement to raising worker pay.\n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion two former executive branch economic hands reach in a new report on what Warren winning the White House would mean for corporate America. Sarah Bianchi and Ernie Tedeschi, now analysts at research firm Evercore ISI, write in a private report the Massachusetts Democrat probably would face a Republican Senate, hamstringing her ability to move much of her legislative agenda.\n\nBut as Warren said at the last debate, \u201cI know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it.\u201d\n\nThe resulting regulatory bonanza, Bianchi and Tedeschi argue, would reach into just about every corner of the economy. \u201cAll any President needs is to have an effective group of Administration officials in place with a clear agenda \u2014 which Warren certainly provides,\u201d they write. \u201cThis is where much of the action in her Administration would be.\u201d Bianchi was director of economic and domestic policy for ex-vice president Joe Biden, who is running for president in 2020; and Tedeschi served as a senior adviser and economist at the Treasury Department during the Obama administration.\n\nWe\u2019ve written here about the difficulty Warren could face getting nominees confirmed by a GOP Senate. But it\u2019s worth considering the range of the moves she could try to make toward the \u201cbig, structural change\u201d to which she has committed herself on the campaign trail. President Trump has certainly taken advantage of his regulatory powers, as did his predecessor, former President Obama.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the actions a President Warren could take, per the Evercore ISI report.\n\n1. A muscular antitrust push.\n\nA Warren administration could juice investigations the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have launched into big tech companies \u2014 and push to break up Amazon, Facebook and Google, Bianchi and Tedeschi write (Warren has made no secret of her desire to break up large tech companies like Facebook). They argue the senator would also fight to block tech giants from acquiring startups that pose a competitive threat. \u201cCompanies have the ability to take the government to court,\u201d they write. \u201cBut there is no doubt that a Warren Administration would make corporate America think twice before proposing many mergers.\u201d (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nIt\u2019s not just big tech that would feel new antitrust heat from Washington. Bianchi and Tedeschi argue. \u201cWarren gave a speech in 2016 where she outlined her views about the concentration throughout the economy, including aspects of the health care sector, agriculture, and beyond,\u201d the report says, noting Warren was critical of the Obama administration for not being more aggressive on this front. \u201cThere is no question she would look to undo certain mergers and there certainly would be a higher bar for [mergers and acquisitions] that increases industry concentration for a variety of industries.\u201d\n\nGoogle's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. (AP / Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\n2. Tough new rules for Wall Street.\n\nThough Warren wants to break up the big banks by restoring the Glass Steagall Act, the proposal stands little chance of moving on the Hill. But Bianchi and Tedeschi point to several other pressure points a President Warren could target through executive authority. Among them: Ramping up pressure on the big banks through the living wills process; applying new scrutiny to credit ratings agencies via the Securities and Exchange Commission; and cracking down on non-bank financial companies, including by reviving the designation of some as systemically risky, subjecting them to stricter federal oversight.\n\n3. More \u201ceconomic cold war\u201d with China.\n\nWarren has been a tough critic of Beijing and would likely confront the regime on a number of issues. \u201cWe think Senator Warren could be tougher particularly around issues such as labor, environmental rights, including Climate Change,\u201d Bianchi and Tedeschi write. \u201cMoreover, we think that she is trying to \u2018out tough\u2019 Trump on China given the political benefits of doing so, particularly in the Midwest.\u201d\n\nThey argue Warren would speak out where Trump hasn\u2019t, on human rights issues generally and the protests in Hong Kong specifically. She could look to bring that push home by extending \u201ccriticism or action to Americans companies that have stopped their workers from expressing views on China or have put their companies in vulnerable positions by producing in the country or making the intellectual property vulnerable.\u201d\n\nAnd they conclude she would continue the Trump team\u2019s effort to decouple U.S. and Chinese supply chains, including by dialing up export controls, regulating foreign investment, and looking to build up American tech and manufacturing capacity.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\n4. Raising worker pay.\n\nWarren can\u2019t achieve her ambition of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by executive fiat. But she could make some opportunities to force companies to hike employee compensation. For example, she could more aggressively enforce rules already on the books governing what constitutes full-time work versus contract work.\n\n5. Stronger corporate accountability.\n\n\u201cOne of Warren\u2019s main messages is that a central reason for the high levels of wealth disparity in the United States is due to a lack of accountability for those at the top \u2013 whether it is the top of the income scale or corporations,\u201d Bianchi and Tedeschi write. \u201cShe has called this out as a Senator and no doubt would use all of the relevant agencies in the government \u2013 from DOJ to CFPB to the SEC \u2013 to hold corporations accountable.\u201d That would include prosecuting executives who break the law. And she could target stock buybacks through rules changes at the SEC.\n\nSome of Warren\u2019s more ambitious regulatory efforts could get knocked down in the courts.\n\nBut the Evercore pair note that Warren made her biggest mark on policy before arriving in the Senate in 2013 \u2014 by standing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cThis is how she thinks about government and we believe her Administration would focus on a similar kind of accountability through the federal government,\u201d they write.\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

WSJ's Paul Kiernan: \"Finance ministers and central bankers who gathered in Washington for the [International Monetary Fund's] fall meetings in recent days said in interviews and public events that the biggest risks to the global economy are trade-related uncertainties and divisions among nations over how to reduce them.\n\nGlobal economic growth has ebbed this year to its slowest pace since the 2009 recession, the IMF said. The main culprit for the malaise has been the trade war between the U.S. and China, which the fund estimates to have left a Switzerland-size hole in the global economy... While the IMF predicts a modest pickup in 2020, it also stressed the risk of growth again falling short. The fund said the world\u2019s three largest economies-\u2014the U.S., China and Japan\u2014are likely to slow further next year.\"\n\nLagarde says the U.S. is at risk of losing its role as a leader: \"Christine Lagarde, the departing head of the International Monetary Fund who is set to take over as president of the European Central Bank, said in an interview that the U.S. risks diminishing its role as a global leader and warned of dire consequences of its trade war with China, the WSJ's Kate O\u2019Keeffe reports.\n\n\"[Lagarde] also warned [Trump] against pushing the Federal Reserve for lower interest rates because it could spur inflation. 'When the unemployment rate is at 3.7%, you don\u2019t want to accelerate that too much by lowering interest rates,' she said. 'Because the risk you take is that then prices begin to go up. You have to be very careful. You know, it\u2019s like navigating a plane.'\"\n\n\u2014 Brexit's path remains uncertain. The Post's William Booth and Michael Birnbaum: \"At the very last minute on Saturday night, [Britist Prime Minister Boris] Johnson asked the Europeans for a Brexit delay until the end of January 2020. In fact, he sent three letters, leaving people to puzzle over exactly which one meant what \u2014 and to wonder: Where Brexit is headed next? A most excellent question. Because nobody really knows.\n\n\"After lawmakers voted 322 to 306 to withhold support for Johnson\u2019s new Brexit deal, scuppering his hope of finalizing Britain\u2019s exit plan at an extraordinary \u2014 but ill-named? \u2014 'Super Saturday' session in Parliament, the prime minister was forced to fold and seek an extension... Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC, 'Notwithstanding the parliamentary shenanigans, we appear to have now the numbers to get this through.'\"\n\nBritish voters are exhausted. From Hermes Investment Management CEO Saker Nusseibeh: \"At this stage, any prediction for the future of this process is by definition perilous, but the popular mood for some sort of closure and an end to uncertainty would argue for an eventual Brexit. The economic price of that divorce as well as any mitigants from a more independent economic policy will not be fully apparent for several parliamentary cycles. The UK has already suffered some economic loss, and I would argue more importantly, deep wounds to its social fabric and political framework, as a result of this process.\"\n\n\u2014 Goldman Sachs: The economic slowdown is widespread. From a note to clients: \"Economic data were titled to the downside this week, underscoring the broad-based nature of the ongoing economic slowdown. While we believe the US economy will be able to withstand the global storm, momentum will continue to cool into 2020. We see GDP growth slowing from 2.2% this year to 1.6% in 2020 as cautious consumers drive the economy at a slower pace.\"\n\nIn a Strong Economy, Why Are So Many Workers on Strike?

(Bridget Bennett/Bloomberg)\n\n\u2014 Exclusive: Private equity goes on offense. The industry has come in for some harsh criticism from Democrats \u2014 particularly from Warren, who has called the firms \u201cvampires\u201d that are \u201clooting\u201d the economy and pitched a plan one economist said would \u201dbe the end of private equity as we know it.\u201d Now the sector is fighting back, ramping up a campaign to convince voters and policymakers that the business model supports jobs and economic growth.\n\nThe American Investment Council, private equity\u2019s lobbying group in Washington, is releasing a new economic report from Ernst and Young that says the industry supports 26 million American jobs and 5 percent of U.S. economic activity \u2014 while paying $174 billion in federal, state and local taxes last year. It highlighted Ohio\u2019s share with a release and an ad last week timed to the Democratic presidential debate there. And as it braces for more heat from presidential contenders, the group is also going up with a six-figure digital ad campaign in Washington and early-voting states to advance its message about the industry\u2019s contributions.\n\nLobbyists say they can work with Warren. Politico's Theodoric Meyer: \"Even in a Democratic presidential field in which most candidates have sworn off contributions from lobbyists, Warren\u2019s hostility to K Street stands out.

Workload and schedule were cited as important causes. Such conflicts could become problematic, the survey found, when it came to Boeing engineers who played dual roles designing certain systems on behalf of the plane maker and then certifying the same systems as safe on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration, as part of a decades-old agency program that effectively outsources such regulatory work to company employees.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Buttigieg eyes 35 percent corporate rate to fund health plan: \u201cPete Buttigieg would pay for his $1.5 trillion health-care plan by rolling back President Donald Trump\u2019s corporate tax cut to return the rate to 35% and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, campaign spokesman Sean Savett said,\u201d Bloomberg News\u2019s Sahil Kapur reports.\n\n\u201cButtigieg\u2019s \u2018Medicare for all who want it\u2019 plan would extend the federal health-care program for seniors as an option for Americans who prefer it, while also letting people opt for private plans.
