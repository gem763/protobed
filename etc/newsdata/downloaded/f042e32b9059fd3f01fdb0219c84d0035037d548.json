It was not clear what the 15 investigations pertained to, nor Zlochevsky's role in them.\n\n'Conspiracy theories'\n\nTrump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has pursued unsubstantiated allegations that Biden had tried to fire Ukraine's then-chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016, to stop him investigating Burisma. Biden has accused Giuliani of peddling \"false, debunked conspiracy theories\".\n\nRyaboshapka took over as General Prosecutor at the end of August.\n\nTrump on Thursday publicly called on China to investigate Joe Biden. Trump said he believed both China and Ukraine should look into Biden and his son, and described the impeachment probe as \"crap\".\n\n\"I don't care about Biden's campaign but I do care about corruption,\" Trump told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"If we feel there is corruption, we have a right to go to a foreign country,\" he said.", "description": "It is the first concrete sign of how Ukraine plans to handle investigations that are being closely watched in Washington amid possible impeachment of Donald Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/75/32/1000x563_cmsv2_4221c805-4b86-5712-a992-f0fbea4eed6b-4207532.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
