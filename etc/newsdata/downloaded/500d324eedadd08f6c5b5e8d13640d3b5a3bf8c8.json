A number of protesters similarly held spent casings in their hands.\n\nLebanon's army said in a statement that it intervened in a clash between protesters and citizens who were trying to drive through the blocked road, at which point stones and fireworks were thrown at them.\n\nThe army was then \"forced to fire in the air\", and also used tear gas and rubber bullets, injuring a number of people, the statement said.\n\nThe army said it brought in reinforcements and launched an investigation into the matter, adding that five soldiers were injured in the clashes. Calm was restored in the Beddawi area by nightfall.\n\nThe incident occurred after a high-level meeting of the country's top security branches was held earlier at the Lebanese Army's headquarters in an attempt to agree a plan to reopen the country's roads, many of which have been blocked by protesters since a largely peaceful nationwide uprising began on October 17.\n\nDemonstrators who first took to the streets to oppose new taxes are calling for the resignation of the government and for politicians who have ruled the country since its 1975-90 civil war to be held accountable for decades of corruption.\n\nPrime Minister Saad Hariri has responded by cancelling proposals for new taxes and promising support for low-income families, while President Michel Aoun asked protesters to select representatives with whom a dialogue can be held.\n\nAoun, Hariri and Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah have also all called for roads to be reopened.\n\nSaturday's security meeting to that end brought together the Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun and the heads of Lebanon's three other major security services, The Internal Security Forces, General Security and State Security.\n\nBeirut protests\n\nIn the capital Beirut, security forces attempted to clear vital roads throughout Saturday, including a ring-road connecting east and west Beirut and a crossing on the capital's outskirts through which traffic passes to the mountains behind the city, known as the \"Chevrolet crossing\".\n\nIn a game of cat-and-mouse, protesters were pushed from one road, blocked another, and then headed back to the roads from which they were removed earlier.\n\n191026094204733\n\n\"We will close the ring road, we will close the banks street, we will close [the street] in front of the [Central] Bank, we will close all of Lebanon,\" a protester blocking a main road in downtown Beirut shouted.\n\nShortly thereafter, that group of protesters ran towards the ring road and blocked it.\n\nAs of 6:30pm local time (15:30 GMT), hundreds of protesters held both the ring road and the Chevrolet crossing, in addition to the downtown Beirut area which was filled with tens of thousands of demonstrators.\n\nProtesters continued to hold several areas along the main north-south highway, including in Jal el-Dib, Zouk Mosbeh and Jbeil north of Beirut, and in Jiyyeh south of Beirut, while others occupied squares and roads the eastern Bekaa region, as well as in Sidon and Tyre in south Lebanon.", "description": "The army says it intervened in a clash between protesters and citizens who were trying to drive through a blocked road.", "authors": ["Timour Azhari"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/25/3ca1a94b20904d719104abcbb2db5e60_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
