She has not travelled to the (Democratic Republic of Congo) and was not in close contact to an Ebola patient from DRC or Uganda,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nHe added that the Tanzanian government or the WHO may release test results either late on Friday or on Saturday. Ebola testing usually takes one to two days, Williams said.\n\nThe WHO regional office for Africa said in a statement on Thursday it was aware of a rumour of a death from an unknown illness, adding that the agency \u201cis working with national health authorities and is deploying a technical team to Tanzania to investigate this rumour as a matter of urgency\u201d.\n\nWHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told Reuters in Geneva on Friday that the agency \u201cdoes not have official confirmation of any particular disease\u201d.\n\nThe Tanzanian Health Ministry did not answer calls.\n\nThe Ebola outbreak in Congo, the world\u2019s second largest in history, has infected almost 3,000 people in Congo since it began in August 2018, killing two thirds of them.\n\nA few cases have been confirmed in Uganda after infected patients crossed the border, but all either died or were sent back to Congo for specialised treatment.", "description": "A woman whose death in Tanzania is being investigated by the World Health Organization probably did not have Ebola, a spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.", "authors": ["Omar Mohammed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
