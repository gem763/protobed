Will that solve the underlying issue? To answer this, we need to look a little deeper.\n\nASIC's statement this month highlighted the main concerns were with funds where lower balances stayed that way. To understand how this happens, the ATO has targeted SMSFs with a limited recourse borrowing arrangement (LRBA). Often a single asset like property makes up the vast majority of the fund\u2019s assets, in some cases more than 90 per cent. With such a non-liquid, cash-poor asset with high costs and variable income, there is little potential to grow super beyond changes in the value of the asset as contributions are gobbled up in maintenance and other overheads.\n\nA 2019 report from the Council of Financial Regulators expressed concerns over the concentration of LRBAs in SMSFs with low balances, which has resulted in little diversification and high loan-to-value ratios. It\u2019s no wonder that financial advisers are being subjected to more surveillance and enforcement by ASIC in this area \u2013 particularly \"one-stop shops\" where borrowing within the SMSF for a property asset is a key sales focus.\n\nThat said, we firmly believe that SMSFs with balances below $500,000 can and should do well. We encourage investors and potential new SMSFs not to focus on the balance identified by ASIC as it is misrepresentative of the key underlying issues.", "description": "DIY funds with less than $500,000 can thrive \u2013 as long as trustees have a structured investment strategy, contain costs and follow the rules.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.181%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8b30c89c3d40ec0ddf3baba85305c398f11d0ff2", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
