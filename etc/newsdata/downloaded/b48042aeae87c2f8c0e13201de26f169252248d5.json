His film, titled \u201cNo Time to Die,\u201d is expected to be released sometime in 2020. According to the outlet, it will be the 51-year-old\u2019s final appearance as the suave leading man who prefers his martinis shaken, not stirred.\n\nROGER MOORE'S DAUGHTER SAYS JAMES BOND STAR 'VISITS' HER FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lasted until now,\u201d said Geoffrey. \u201cIt\u2019s the longest living franchise. I don\u2019t think it will go unless a meteor comes crashing down and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nGeoffrey also shared producer Barbara Broccoli would get his full support if she were to move forward and break tradition by casting a woman in the leading role.\n\n\u201cIt would be her idea,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cAnd if that were the case I\u2019d definitely back her, and I think the fans would go along with that.\u201d\n\nThese days, Geoffrey is determined to keep the legacy that his father created with UNICEF alive. Moore accepted the role of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 1991.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really say no to Audrey [Hepburn],\u201d said Geoffrey. \u201cShe said, \u2018Please come along.\u2019 That\u2019s when she really realized the power of stardom and how she could bring this matter to a wider audience. He didn\u2019t have much to say because he didn\u2019t know much about it, but as a crash course she said, \u2018Come and see what I see,\u2019 and he couldn\u2019t stop crying.\u201d\n\nROGER MOORE DEAD: 'JAMES BOND' ACTOR WAS 89\n\n\u201c\u2026So he continued that goodwill program,\u201d Geoffrey said. \u201cAudrey was the founder but she needed a contemporary who had that kind of reach to a wider audience. And he kept it going.\u201d\n\nThe outlet revealed Geoffrey has since released a song titled \u201cU.N.I (You & I) which he co-wrote. Production credits went to Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers, actress Naya Rivera and former \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d personality Julianne Hough. The song is meant to raise funds for UNICEF in honor of Moore\u2019s memory.\n\nBack in 2018, Moore\u2019s daughter Deborah recalled her final moments with the film icon to UK\u2019s Yours magazine. She insisted Moore never lost his charm, even as he was battling cancer.\n\n\u201cDad was such a kind man and had a wonderful sense of humor,\u201d she said at the time.\n\n\u201cEven when he was in [the] hospital in his last days, he had a twinkle in his eye, and you could see him flirting with the nurses. I\u2019d have to say \u2018Dad, behave!\u2019\u201d\n\nROGER MOORE'S DAUGHTER SHARES MEMORIES OF GROWING UP WITH JAMES BOND STAR\n\nDeborah still had fond memories of growing up with the Hollywood star. She described how even when Moore was at the height of his fame, family always came first.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d usually take us on film sets with him when he was working because, being such a family man, he didn\u2019t want us to be split up,\" she said. \"As we were quite young \u2013 I was 10 when he got Bond \u2013 we were taken out of school for a few months and a tutor would come with us so we didn\u2019t miss out on class. I remember when we went to Jamaica to film Bond \u2013 it was all very exciting.\u201d\n\nMoore didn\u2019t think twice when it came to welcoming his children into his star-studded world of filmmaking. But, when cameras stopped rolling, he preferred to dedicate his time to them.\n\n\u201cHis favorite thing to do with us when we were young was to take us swimming, especially when we went out to Italy, where my mother was from,\u201d said Deborah. \u201cIt was right by the sea, so every morning we\u2019d get up at the crack of dawn together and go out for a swim. It was wonderful.\u201d\n\nFORMER BOND GIRL SLAMS FEMALE 007: JAMES BOND 'WAS CONCEIVED AS A MAN'\n\nMoore also taught his children the importance of giving back to those in need.\n\n\u201cHe cared hugely about what was happening in the world and got very upset about injustices, particularly towards women and children,\u201d said Deborah, also an actress..\n\nWith the help of UNICEF, the goodwill ambassador traveled the world for over 26 years to champion children\u2019s rights. In 1999, he was made a Commander of the British Empire and was knighted in 2003.\n\nThen in 2012, he raised more than $1 million for the organization by leading a Bond-themed auction. That same year, he received the first UNICEF UK Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n\u201cHe actually turned down a lot of work because of his UNICEF commitments,\u201d said Deborah. \u201cHe even used to get a little bit annoyed when he went on talk shows and found it hard to get around to talking about the charity. He\u2019d always come away and say, \u2018Oh I wish I\u2019d had more time to talk about UNICEF.\u2019\u201d\n\nFORMER JAMES BOND PIERCE BROSNAN WANTS A FEMALE 007\n\nAnd throughout his life, Moore never took his fame for granted, a lesson he was determined to teach his daughter.\n\nDEMI MOORE REVEALS 'INDECENT PROPOSAL' DIRECTOR DEMANDED SHE GAIN WEIGHT\n\n\u201cDad taught me to always be appreciative of what you have,\u201d said Deborah. \u201cIn fact, he would never say no to anyone who asked for an autograph. Even if it was at the most inconvenient moment, he\u2019d be so gracious and say yes.\n\n\"I remember he once said, \u2018These are the people who put me here\u2019 and that\u2019s why he did it. He also taught me that it\u2019s so easy to be kind and so hard to be unkind because he always had so much love and respect for other people. He was such a good man.\u201d", "description": "Roger Moore\u2019s son Geoffrey believes his father made the right decision when he walked away from James Bond after 1985\u2019s \u201cA View to a Kill.\u201d", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Roger-Moore-Bond-1972.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
