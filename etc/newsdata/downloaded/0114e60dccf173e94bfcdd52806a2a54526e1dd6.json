(AP) - A handful of voices softly chattering in Spanish filter into a building that\u2019s become the heart of Winchester Heights, a Willcox neighborhood filled with farmworkers. The community center is dedicated to connecting southeastern Arizona residents - with one another and with better health care.\n\nAs the clock nears 6 p.m., more men and women arrive, some coming straight from 10-hour shifts in the greenhouses of a tomato farm north of Willcox. Musculoskeletal problems, frequent exposure to excessive heat and long-term exposure to pesticides are common problems for Arizona agricultural workers, and just a handful of the many issues this year-old center aims to address.\n\n\u201cFor this community in particular, it\u2019s because they\u2019re so rural and isolated that a lot of the time they can\u2019t go to the doctor,\u201d said Linda Cifuentes, a staff member of the Southeast Arizona Area Health Education Center, or SEAHEC, and coordinator at the Winchester Heights Community Center.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t make the drive all the way to Tucson to see a provider. And surely, they come across a lot of people who aren\u2019t bilingual in these health facilities.\u201d\n\nEnter SEAHEC and its Healthy Farms Program.\n\nCronkite News reports the organization partnered with the University of Arizona to establish the community center, completed in August 2018. In addition to serving as a gathering place for the 600 or so mostly Latino people living in Winchester Heights, the multipurpose center helps educate residents about how to better care for themselves.\n\n\u201cSince they are mostly farmworkers . we\u2019ve taught them about safety in the sun, like using solar protection, and also about cancer and what skin cancer looks like,\u201d Cifuentes said.\n\nAdditional training has focused on nutrition, diabetes and treating common problems like a cold or the flu, as well as how to distinguish one from the other.\n\nThe center also trains some locals as health promoters, or \u201cpromotoras de salud,\u201d to work as health educators and advocates.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll go from home to home teaching family members about these health issues and how to watch (out) for each other,\u201d Cifuentes said.\n\nAccess to health treatment is a challenge in isolated agricultural communities. According to the National Rural Health Association, the patient-to-primary care physician ratio in rural communities is 39.8 doctors per 100,000 people , compared with 53.3 per 100,000 in urban areas.\n\nThe number of uninsured also is higher in rural areas, and many seasonal or contract farmworkers do not receive health insurance benefits. U.S. Department of Labor statistics show that about 53% of farmworkers in the country lack such insurance. In comparison, the national average of uninsured adults younger than 65 is 13%.\n\nNatureSweet, a tomato producer based in San Antonio, Texas, employs more than 400 workers at its operation north of Willcox. Inside greenhouses punctuated with row after row of tomato plants, farmhands pluck, prune and sort as bees flit to their hives, heavy with pollen.\n\nThe workers, a mix of contract laborers and regular employees, are expected to toil four days a week, with Wednesdays and weekends off to spend time with family, pay bills and tend to health needs.\n\nEfrain Gutierrez is one of them. At the community center one recent evening, Gutierrez laughed when asked when he last visited a doctor. Not in years, he said in Spanish, despite having company-provided health insurance. His health, he added, seems good.\n\nHe helps organize soccer games at the new field behind the community center and is grateful for the positive changes he sees.\n\n\u201cThere were 40 men, 20 women and more than 100 kids playing here - something never seen before,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cI\u2019m very thankful to the center . and to the people who go house-to-house checking water quality and how we\u2019re doing. This community was very abandoned before.\u201d\n\nJill Guernsey de Zapien, director of border, transborder and binational public health research at the University of Arizona and a founder of SEAHEC, has devoted her career to studying the health issues that uniquely affect rural residents and agricultural workers. She was inspired by her father\u2019s work as a labor organizer.\n\n\u201cI learned as a child about the invisibility of farmworkers,\u201d she said. \u201cEven as a child, it\u2019s so easy to make the connections and go . \u2018Why don\u2019t they get a decent wage? . Everything I\u2019m eating, I couldn\u2019t be eating without them being here.\u2019 Very, very young, I had a real sense of the injustice.\u201d\n\nShe envisions a future where farmworkers receive equal access to health care and have more options that better fit their needs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really needed, because farmworkers are out in the field during the day . so increasing the access of hours I think is good,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in the end, they shouldn\u2019t be any different than any of the rest of us.\u201d\n\nWith her students and the current director of SEAHEC, Gail Emrick, Guernsey de Zapien has continued to examine how to make a difference in other communities like Winchester Heights.\n\nIn Winchester Heights, the change is tangible.\n\nA few months after the community center opened, a mobile health clinic, run by Chiricahua Community Health Centers, came to Winchester Heights. Every Wednesday, excluding holidays, the mobile unit parks next to the center to provide checkups and treat people for diabetes, hypertension and common chronic illnesses that disproportionately affect Latinos.\n\nCifuentes said efforts such as those happening in Winchester Heights could serve as a model for other rural or underserved communities.\n\n\u201cI knew that farmworkers were very much a vulnerable population,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know to what extent.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Cronkite News https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A handful of voices softly chattering in Spanish filter into a building that's become the heart of Winchester Heights, a Willcox neighborhood filled with farmworkers.
