Add Interest\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday his administration has warned officials in Los Angeles and other cities in California to \"clean it up.\"\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSpeaking at a GOP lawmaker retreat in Baltimore -- a city he said this summer was \"rat and rodent infested\" -- he claimed businesses are leaving Democratic-controlled cities.\n\n\"We're going to fight for the future of cities like Baltimore that have been destroyed by decades of failed and corrupt rule. These are our great American cities and they're an embarrassment,\" Trump said.\n\nHe's made it a campaign issue, telling a Make America Great Again rally in August in Ohio, \"Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame the world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible disgusting conditions. Look at San Francisco. Look at some of your other cities.\"\n\nA White House official confirmed there was an administration team on the ground in California this week on a fact-finding mission about the homelessness crisis but didn\u2019t elaborate on any specific options being discussed.\n\n\u201cLike many Americans, the President has taken notice of the homelessness crisis, particularly in cities and states where the liberal policies of overregulation, excessive taxation, and poor public service delivery are combining to dramatically increase poverty and public health risks,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn June, the President took action and signed an Executive Order to confront the regulatory barriers to affordable housing development, a leading cause of homelessness. President Trump has directed his team to go further and develop a range of policy options for consideration to deal with this tragedy.\u201d\n\nJeff Chiu/AP, FILE\n\nA HUD spokesperson said the administration is looking at a range of options.\n\n\u201cThe spike in homelessness we are seeing in places like Los Angeles and San Francisco is alarming. While there are many state and local issues at play here, we\u2019re looking at a range of options available to us at HUD \u2013 as well as other agencies \u2013 for possible federal action, if and where appropriate,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported Tuesday that Trump ordered aides to launch a \u201csweeping effort\u201d to combat homelessness in California cities, which the story said could include plans to force people out of tent camps and direct them into unused government facilities.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times also reported officials met with law enforcement unions in the city a discussed a range of issues including possible options to increase law enforcement involvement.\n\nFrederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nWhile the White House statement seems to shift partial blame for the problem on local policies. In a letter to Trump, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he welcomes increased attention to the issue of homelessness but that lack of resources and support on the federal level are also part of the problem.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that no local government, including ours, can address homelessness on our own,\u201d Garcetti said in the letter.\n\n\u201cFor many years, the federal government has woefully underfunded our housing safety net, contributing to homelessness. The federal government cut HUD funding for the production of new housing and preservation by 31% for the 2016-2018 time period, and according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, only one in four low-income families who qualify for housing assistance actually receive it. This pressure is acutely felt here in Los Angeles, where 36,000 people experience homelessness on any given night.\u201d\n\nMario Tama/Getty Images, FILE\n\nAffordable housing and homelessness advocacy groups like the National Low Income Housing Coalition said the most significant step the administration could take would be to fund existing programs focused on ending homelessness and stop proposing cuts to the budget for those programs at HUD and the Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\n\u201cThe solution to homelessness is affordable homes \u2013 not criminalization, not punishing poor people for being poor, not sweeping homeless people into increasingly unsafe areas, and not warehousing people in untenable and unsustainable conditions,\u201d NLIHC president and CEO Diane Yentel said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHomelessness in California is a crisis, as it is in many other areas of the country, and it demands action from federal, state and local government. But Trump and his administration are not acting in good faith to solve for it \u2013 they\u2019ve worked time and again over the last 2 years to worsen the housing and homelessness crisis and this latest effort looks to be no different,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvocates have also said in the past that uncertainty about federal grant programs during shutdowns and the federal budget process can also make the private housing sector less willing to work with nonprofits on affordable housing, adding more challenges to the issue.\n\nABC News' Meridith McGraw contributed to this report.", "description": "Officials from the Trump administration met with local agencies and advocates on homelessness in Los Angeles this past week.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/homeless-san-francisco-ap-jt-190911_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
