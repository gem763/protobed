Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nWhen a \u2018crazy rumor\u2019 becomes reality\n\nPresident Trump on Thursday awarded the 2020 Group of Seven summit of world leaders to the Trump National Doral Miami golf resort in Florida, using his public office to direct a major contract to himself.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s Doral resort has been in sharp decline in recent years, according to the Trump Organization\u2019s records. The G-7 summit will draw hundreds of diplomats, journalists and security personnel to the resort during June \u2014 one of its slowest months of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEven if they just charge the government their costs, it\u2019s still a huge win for them because this is a time of year that the hotel is normally 60 percent empty,\u201d says reporter David Fahrenthold , who covers the Trump family and its business interests. \u201cThey\u2019re able to pay costs they would otherwise eat.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut is it legal?\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe constitution says that the federal government can\u2019t pay the president any money beyond the salary he receives as president and that foreign governments can\u2019t pay the president money unless Congress approves,\u201d Fahrenthold says. \u201cThis is a case where Trump is inviting both the federal government and foreign governments to pay him money all at the same time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s soccer sees a renaissance\n\nOver the summer, the U.S. women\u2019s national soccer team took home its fourth World Cup championship. The women on the team were widely lauded not only as titans of the sport but as legends elevating women\u2019s rights and the sport of soccer globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nRose Lavelle is a breakout star from the World Cup. She tells guest host Nicole Ellis that this renaissance in the sport is not \u201ca moment but a movement.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 24, Lavelle is widely considered to be the future of women\u2019s soccer. The midfielder for the Washington Spirit, part of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, was awarded the bronze ball for third-best player in the World Cup tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think we've seen a big bump after the World Cup, and I think now it's just about maintaining that and making sure this isn't just an every-four-years type of thing,\u201d Lavelle says. \u201cIt's an every-year, every-day kind of thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMonths after the World Cup and the team\u2019s victory tour, momentum and enthusiasm for women\u2019s soccer has kept ticket sales and TV ratings up. But reporter Steven Goff says that, in terms of the NWSL, \u201cyou know it needs to grow and it needs to invest more money in its players.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Washington Spirit\u2019s head coach, Richie Burke, says that while he\u2019s \u201cnew to the movement,\u201d a lot of investors are looking at women\u2019s soccer as \u201ca sleeping giant.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe studio making money by breaking Hollywood\u2019s rules\n\nA24 isn\u2019t like other film production houses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the studio that everyone wants to work with,\u201d says pop culture reporter Sonia Rao . \u201cBut at the same time, they\u2019re the studio the random kid in your film class would be so into, and you\u2019re like: \u2018That\u2019s so annoying. Stop talking about this. We all appreciate the studio.\u2019 You know what I mean?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd whatever it is doing differently \u2014 such as affording filmmakers a lot of autonomy and using social media promotion more effectively than other distributors \u2014 it\u2019s definitely working, Rao says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "David Fahrenthold scrutinizes the president\u2019s decision to award a major government contract \u2014 to himself.
