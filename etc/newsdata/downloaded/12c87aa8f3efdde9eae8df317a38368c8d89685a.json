But, with national elections approaching, recriminations over the blazes have ratcheted up tensions in the already politically volatile region.\n\nAccording to figures from the government of the Santa Cruz department, more than 4m hectares (9.9m acres) of forest and arable land \u2013 an area almost the size of Switzerland \u2013 have been ravaged by the fires.\n\nA further 1.3m hectares were destroyed in the northern Beni department. Seven firefighters died and 10,000 families were forced to leave their homes.\n\n'Murderer of nature': Evo Morales blamed as Bolivia battles devastating fires Read more\n\nCarmi\u00f1a Aguilera, a 40-year-old administrative worker, found herself on the frontline of the battle against the flames after she volunteered to provide food and supplies to affected communities.\n\n\u201cI was born for it,\u201d she said, speaking by phone from Concepci\u00f3n, 175 miles (280km) north of Santa Cruz, the regional capital. \u201cI didn\u2019t need any introduction, I simply put on the extinguisher backpack and start killing the fires. I went in four times, it felt good.\u201d\n\nAguilera says she had always wanted to be a firefighter but had been put off by the training and time constraints that come from being a mother of three. Following her literal baptism of fire, she became a certified forest firefighter on 25 September.\n\nThanks to the work of more than 1,000 volunteer firefighters such as Aguilera, rural populations can now start taking stock of the damage done.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A burned forest in Charagua, southern Bolivia.

More than 2 million animals are estimated to have been killed and huge swathes of forest turned to ash.\n\n\u201cThe Chiquitano dry forest is a unique ecosystem, some of the trees there are over 200 years old,\u201d said Aguilera. \u201cIt will take many years to recover what was lost.\u201d\n\nThe government says that in the coming days it will send teams of zoologists and botanists to study the affected areas, with their reports due in November.\n\nBut the fires have focused public anger on President Evo Morales, who is seeking his fourth consecutive term in elections on 20 October. Polls suggest he may be forced into a run-off vote.\n\nEarlier this month hundreds of thousands of people joined a mass protest in Santa Cruz over what they said was a slow response to the fire. Speakers held Morales responsible for the destruction because of his decrees promoting slash-and-burn agriculture in forest areas.\n\nMorales would need 40% of votes nationwide and a 10-point margin for a first round victory, but polls published on Thursday showed him on just 36.2% of votes, behind his main challenger, the former president Carlos Mesa.\n\n\u201cA couple of months ago it seemed Morales was set for a first-round victory, but his handling of the fires have seen him lose support,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Pe\u00f1aranda, a political analyst. \u201cThe fires have also caused increased tension and polarisation in Bolivian society.\u201d", "description": "Polls suggest Evo Morales may face a run-off vote after being blamed for devastating blazes", "authors": ["Mat Youkee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0ce97d6958d962b68d3840cfedc4e923f2db31b/0_86_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4aef0dbc0f3c189c65b9bacede5a4a76", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
