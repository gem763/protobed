Peter Speliopoulos at his wheel, working on a vessel. Photo: Courtesy of Les Ateliers Courbet\n\nPeter Speliopoulos has long been a mainstay in the fashion world \u2014 he began his career in 1997 at Cerruti in Paris and went on to become the senior vice-president of design and creative at Donna Karan. In the past few years, however, his medium has switched from fine fabrics to clay. \u201cIt may sound clich\u00e9d, but throwing on the wheel is very Zen,\u201d Speliopoulos says. \u201cIt is all about centering. I think there is a direct psychological correlation between one\u2019s state of mind and the piece being thrown.\u201d In early September, the former fashion designer\u2019s work will be on display in the Chelsea-based design studio Les Ateliers Courbet. A recent visit to his showroom in Long Island City revealed the full range of his artistic interests and endeavors: a collection of photographs by Daniel Gordon including a self-portrait (seen below), a bevy of wall-mounted African masks, and tables brimming with his ceramic vessels.\n\nThe showroom.

They beg to be touched.\u201d Photo: Courtesy of Les Ateliers Courbet\n\nLes Ateliers Courbet will unveil Peter Speliopoulos\u2019s solo exhibition \u201cArchaeos\u201d in early September.", "description": "A tour through the showroom of fashion designer-turn-ceramicist Peter Speliopoulos.
