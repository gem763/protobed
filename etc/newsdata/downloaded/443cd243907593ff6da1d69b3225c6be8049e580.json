What he's done is domestically damaging and globally embarrassing. And it speaks to a pattern of events that's not just isolated to 2001,\" Majumder said.\n\nBoth men spoke to The Current interim host Laura Lynch in the hours after the photo was published by Time Magazine.\n\nSince then, a separate video of Trudeau in blackface has also come to light.\n\nAlthough the two strategists come from different political sides, both acknowledged that the incident called back difficult memories.\n\n\"I know the tinge of, you know, being called the P-word and being ashamed of your skin colour. And that does burn deeply,\" said Khan.\n\n\"I think that that kind of hurt is something that a lot of people of colour have grown up with,\" added Majumdar.\n\nTo discuss the fallout of Trudeau's brownface photo, Lynch spoke with:\n\nOmar Khan, vice president of public affairs with Hill and Knowlton Strategies.\n\nShuvaloy Majumdar, former policy director to Conservative foreign ministers.\n\nCBC reporter Tom Parry, who was aboard the Liberals' campaign plane for Trudeau's Wednesday night apology.\n\nWritten by Kate McGillivray. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bProduced by John Chipman, Cathy Simon, Geoff Turner and Elizabeth Hoath.", "description": "Political strategists Shuvaloy Majumder and Omar Khan on Justin Trudeau's brownface photo, plus a conversation with CBC reporter Tom Parry about his late-night apology on board the Liberal campaign plane.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4573226.1520889152!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/omar-khan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
