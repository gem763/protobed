He took the time to introduce himself to me, shake my hand and call me Richie\u2026 Most mob guys are grumpy. They\u2019re not outgoing or friendly. But John was the opposite. He was always smiling, happy, telling jokes and waving to people. He seemed to be enjoying what was happening to him.\u201d\n\nBut Stratton\u2019s documentary, titled \u201cGotti: Godfather & Son,\u201d doesn\u2019t focus on his encounter with the leader of the Gambino crime family.\n\nInstead, it takes place in 1999 when then-35-year-old Junior spoke to his dying father for the last time at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, MO.\n\nIt was during this meeting when Junior asked his father for his blessing to take the unprecedented steps of quitting what might have been one of the last of the major mafia dynasties.\n\nThe documentary features never-before-seen segments from the 90-minute video of that final visit, as well as a first-hand account from Junior. It also highlights interviews with Gotti\u2019s other children Peter and Angel and former FBI agents, among others.\n\nStratton, who was contracted by Playboy to cover Junior\u2019s fourth racketeering trial in New York City, said he kept hearing about the recording, which could have proved whether Junior was still involved with the mafia or not. Gotti was such a high-profile inmate that every visit he had was required to be videotaped.\n\nStratton managed to get access to the tape for his story and still believes it sheds new insight into the father and son confrontation.\n\n\u201cIt was very difficult for him to ask his father permission to leave [the lifestyle],\u201d said Stratton. \u201cHis father wasn\u2019t happy about it. In the tape, you can see his father basically ripping through Junior. \u2018Where\u2019s your dignity? Where\u2019s your manhood?\u2019 But then he changes at a certain point. He becomes a father, instead of the godfather and the boss of the Gambino family. He understand that the life he led can go one or two ways. You die in prison or you die on the street.\u201d\n\nGotti passed away in 2002 at age 61 from throat cancer. In the tape, an emotional Junior is seen breaking down at the sight of his father. Gotti, who was once hailed as the charismatic Dapper Don who favored $2,000 suits and hand-painted floral silk ties, was struck by the deadly disease that resulted in parts of his jaw being reportedly gone.\n\n\u201cYou can see [Junior] crying when he sees his father and how he\u2019s basically disfigured by cancer,\u201d said Stratton. \u201cBut even with cancer, his father is making jokes about it. He\u2019s talking about how he had half of his face removed, how he had some muscle taken off and put on his face. He\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, I told your mother I don\u2019t even have tits anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, Stratton noted Junior was \u201cbrave\u201d for coming forward and asking his father \u201cfor closure,\u201d an alleged code word for leaving the mob.\n\n\u201cHis father wasn\u2019t happy,\u201d said Stratton. \u201cBut what\u2019s interesting is you really see the father change\u2026 He said, \u2018John, if this is what you want to do, you\u2019re your own man. But they will never leave you alone. The government will never accept it. You think they\u2019re going to stop if you plead guilty? They\u2019ll just bring another case. And another case.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd when his father died, Junior said, \u2018I could still hear my father\u2019s words ringing in my ear. \u2018John, they\u2019re never going to leave you alone.\u2019 And Junior went to trial four times after that. His father foretold Junior\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nJunior, who idolized his celebrity father from the time he was a child, was raised to follow in the dominating patriarch\u2019s footsteps. But in the documentary, Junior admitted he didn\u2019t want to suffer from a similar fate and instead, yearned to be a hands-on parent to his own children.\n\n\u201cWhy did he want to leave? I think it becomes obvious,\u201d said Stratton. \u201cThe life his father chose was not for him. He didn\u2019t really like it. Didn\u2019t want it. Didn\u2019t want to be a part of it. He was drawn into it because of who his dad was. He wanted to go into the military and be a different kind of person.\n\n\"But he got captured by the life. Spending time with his father, hanging out at a the social club every day, meeting all these guys, and his father was a huge celebrity. He said his father was an easy person to idolize. That drew him into it. But when his father went to prison, I don\u2019t think there was anything left that [Junior] wanted.\u201d\n\nGotti was ultimately convicted in 1992 for murder and racketeering. But Stratton said Junior had an epiphany when he attended a family gathering.\n\n\u201cHe remembers going to an event and seeing all the women,\u201d said Stratton. \u201cAll the men were either dead or in prison\u2026 He looked around and felt that if he led the life Gotti had, there was going to be a lot of pain. He didn\u2019t want that. He wanted to be a dad to his kids. He wanted to be a very involved father. He wanted to be an uncle to his nephews and nieces.\u201d\n\nStratton noted Junior could have easily waited for his terminally ill father to pass away and officially leave the mafia world behind. However, Junior didn\u2019t want to disappoint his father to the very end.\n\n\u201cI think that really proves the kind of man Junior is,\u201d said Stratton. \u201cAll he had to do was wait until his father died. He could have said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to fight against everything he stands for.\u2019\u2026 He was very nervous and tense about asking permission from his father\u2026 And to say to his father, who was dying of throat cancer in prison, \u2018Dad this is your life, but this is not my life. I want out.\u2019 That struck me as being very brave.\u201d\n\nSome of the FBI agents interviewed for the documentary still believe Junior never left the mob. Some even claimed that both father and son must have acted out the dramatic scene for the courtroom. But Stratton insisted Junior was telling the truth.\n\n\u201cSome believe the only way you quit is to become an informant,\u201d said Stratton. \u201cBut Junior doesn\u2019t think so. He chose to leave that life\u2026 And based on what we know, he left. We can\u2019t find any involvement in any criminal activity\u2026 He chose his blood family over the mafia family.\"\n\n\"Gotti: Father and Son\" premieres Saturday, June 9 at 10 p.m. on A&E.", "description": "Richard Stratton will never forget the time he was locked up behind bars with mob boss John Gotti.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/06/08/694940094001_5795342309001_5795346680001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-07"}
