Nicki is, after all, not known for being a shrinking violet (although she might wear a violet wig on occasion). In fact, just take a look at her past looks and you\u2019ll see that low key isn\u2019t even in Nicki's vocabulary.\n\nSo finally, after teasing a team-up back in July, Nicki and Fendi dropped their long awaited Fendi Prints On x Nicki Minaj on 16 October, and it's predictably a Big Deal. Referencing the rapper\u2019s banger \u201cChun-Li\u201d \u2014 on which Nicki brags about \u201cBentley tints on / Fendi prints on\" \u2014 the collection is the latest in Fendi\u2019s FF Series, a number of capsule collections that puts the fashion house\u2019s iconic FF logo front and centre.\n\nThe Fendi Prints On x Nicki Minaj campaign was shot poolside by a pool by legendary photographer Steven Klein and is as outrageously fabulous as you\u2019d expect. Nicki is flanked by a number of shirtless hunks and badass women, positively dripping in Italian glamour. In fact, Nicki was so excited about her collab with the fashion house, that last month she released a song featuring PnB Rock and Murda Beatz called \u201cFendi\u201d.\n\nThe line, which includes both mens and womenswear, is a perfect encapsulation of Nicki\u2019s more-is-more philosophy. The loud and proud leisurewear includes tracksuits, sneakers and T-shirts emblazoned with Nicki\u2019s face (naturally). Meanwhile, higher end pieces blend high-octane glamor with kaleidoscopic futurism, including cropped reflective jackets, a hot pink shearling bomber festooned with Double-F prints, and a very Minaj-esque body-hugging viscose dress.\n\nSpeaking to Elle about the collection, Nicki said: \"I want to make clothes that make girls with my body look sexy. What I want [to tell] girls is not necessarily, \u2018Go and gain weight and have a big booty,\u2019 but \u2018If you do have curves, be proud of it, flaunt it\u2014love the skin you\u2019re in.\" Who can complain about that, eh?\n\nThe Fendi Prints On x Nicki Minaj is available now from the Fendi website and in selected stores.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "The collab, the latest in Fendi\u2019s \u2018FF Series\u2019, is a festival of fuchsia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da9a489301a59000a05ef75/lede/1571406599388-06_FENDI-PRINTS-ON_Special-shooting.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.9169xh;0xw,0.0138xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
