We all understand that. But I do believe it will be permanent.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the sanctions will be lifted unless something happens that we\u2019re not happy with,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump said that his administration would \u201creserve the right\u201d to reimpose sanctions on Turkey, including increased steel tariffs, if Ankara falls short of its obligations, including protecting religious and ethnic minorities.\n\nTrump said he has instructed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinOn The Money: Waters clashes with Trump officials over 'disastrous' housing finance plan | Dems jump into Trump turf war over student loans | House passes bill targeting anonymous shell companies Two new Trump executive orders will shape up Treasury and hold bureaucracy accountable Trump has floated Mnuchin, Conway for White House chief of staff: report MORE to lift sanctions on Turkey announced on Oct. 14, which targeted top officials and agencies in Ankara, as well as increasing tariffs.\n\nThe speech had the tone of a victory lap for Trump. He insisted he had kept his promises, arguing the U.S. had saved \u201ctens of thousands of Kurds\u201d in the short-term alone.\n\nTrump chided the Obama administration for failing to adequately address the situation in Syria, and he boasted that his overall strategy paid off even as he has come under intense bipartisan scrutiny for his policies on Turkey and Syria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe president is unlikely to be able to fend off continued criticism that the U.S. is ceding ground to enemies and abandoning allies. Russia has already begun to fill the void of U.S. troops in Syria as they exit, reaching an agreement with Turkey a day prior to push Kurdish forces out of territory they once controlled in northern Syria .\n\nDuring his remarks, Trump harkened back to the themes of his original campaign for president, during which he promised to bring home U.S. troops from conflicts abroad.\n\n\u201cThe job of our military is not to police the world,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump weeks ago abruptly announced the removal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, a decision that precipitated a Turkish military incursion against Kurdish forces in the region who had been U.S. allies in the fight against ISIS.\n\nThe decision was heavily criticized by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers and led to a House resolution passed with bipartisan support that rebuked Trump.\n\nLawmakers argued Trump was abandoning the Kurdish fighters and had given the green light for Turkey to launch an offensive into northern Syria that led to bloodshed and uncertainty.\n\nLawmakers have also called for sanctions on Turkey for its offensive against the Kurds.\n\nBut Trump on Wednesday dismissed the idea that the U.S. bears blame for any negative consequences, instead declaring that the newfound ceasefire was a product of his administration.\n\n\u201cThis was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else. No other nation. Very simple,\u201d Trump said, flanked by Vice President Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceTrump hotel cancels Christian aid group's event to support the Kurds: report China is not going to be America's space partner anytime soon Turkey's Erdo\u011fan warns of renewed fighting if Kurds don't withdraw MORE, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoTrump hotel cancels Christian aid group's event to support the Kurds: report Pence on Syria: 'Our troops are coming home' House calls on Russia to release Paul Whelan or else provide evidence of wrongdoing MORE and national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re willing to take blame and we\u2019re also willing to take credit,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is something they\u2019ve been trying to do for many, many decades.\u201d\n\nTrump vociferously defended his decision to pull U.S. troops from northern Syria and again asserted that the violent skirmishes between Turkish and Kurdish forces were necessary to get a ceasefire.\n\n\u201cHalting the incursion by military force would have required deploying tens of thousands of military troops against Turkey, a NATO ally,\u201d Trump said, cheering his \u201cgood\u201d relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n\nTrump's announcement came hours after the Turkish Army had halted its incursion into northern Syria and one day after Turkey and Russia struck a deal that gives Moscow additional influence in the region and forces Kurdish forces to retreat from the area.\n\nThe Turkish Defense Ministry said in a statement that it would not advance further into Syria in its offensive targeting Kurdish forces.\n\nThe deal between Ankara and Moscow redraws the power structure in the region given the absence of the U.S. The agreement allows the Russia-backed Syrian government of President Bashar Assad to retake parts of the country the Kurds had previously controlled.\n\nTrump also confirmed he would leave a \u201csmall number\u201d of U.S. troops in Syria near oil fields. He said the U.S. troops would be \u201cprotecting\u201d the oil and \u201cdeciding what we\u2019re going to do with it in the future.\u201d\n\nLawmakers have expressed concern that the chaos caused by Turkey\u2019s invasion would lead to an ISIS resurgence, including allowing ISIS prisoners to escape while their Kurdish guards focused on fighting Turkey.\n\nBut that, too, Trump dismissed Wednesday. He said just a \u201csmall number\u201d have escaped, adding, without evidence, that they have been \u201clargely recaptured.\u201d He also said Kurdish Gen. Mazloum Kobani has assured him that prisoners remain under \u201cvery, very strict lock and key.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperOvernight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Hillicon Valley: Zuckerberg would support delaying Libra | More attorneys general join Facebook probe | Defense chief recuses from 'war cloud' contract | Senate GOP blocks two election security bills | FTC brings case against 'stalking' app developer Pentagon chief recusing himself from B 'war cloud' contract MORE said Tuesday in an interview with CNN that \"a little bit more than 100\" ISIS fighters have escaped.\n\nQuestions remain about how the United States will continue its anti-ISIS campaign in Syria with most U.S. troops leaving.\n\nU.S. officials originally said the troops would move to western Iraq and conduct operations from there. But Iraqi officials, heeding the sensitivities of their constituencies at the appearance of a U.S. occupation, rejected that plan.\n\nAfter meeting with Esper on Wednesday, Iraqi officials said U.S. troops would have four weeks to stay in Iraq before they have to leave.\n\nGiven all the remaining questions, Trump\u2019s announcement is unlikely to quell the unrest that his withdrawal caused in Congress.\n\nAt the same time as Trump\u2019s announcement, his special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, was testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where lawmakers told him Trump caused \u201ca mess\u201d in Syria.\n\nBut efforts at a congressional response to Trump\u2019s withdrawal have hit partisan roadblocks amid debates about the best way forward.\n\nA House-passed resolution opposing the withdrawal has been blocked twice in the Senate.
