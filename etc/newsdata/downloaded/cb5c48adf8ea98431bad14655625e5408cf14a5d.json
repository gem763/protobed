(Jan Gerber, News24)\n\nWith Mashaba's eyes boring into the back of his head, Motsoaledi said former minister of home affairs Malusi Gigaba met with him, and earlier this year another former minister of home affairs, Siyabonga Cwele, extended an olive branch and met with him, and they even released a joint statement.\n\nMotsoaledi said he was not denying that migration was a \"huge problem\" in the country.\n\n\"We do have porous borders and they are very problematic.\"\n\nHe said there was a big spike in asylum applications in 2008, coinciding with the worldwide economic recession. The department didn't expect this and since, there have been \"very serious backlogs\".\n\n\"We must understand that immigration is a global issue,\" Motsoaledi said.\n\n\"Nobody is denied a service because they are undocumented.\"\n\nOn Monday, Mashaba announced his resignation from the DA and as mayor, effective November 27. He said he would resign if Helen Zille was elected chairperson the DA's federal council on Sunday. She was.\n\nIn the run-up to the ANC's elective conference in 2017, Masina said he would resign if Cyril Ramaphosa was elected to lead the ANC. This happened, but he is yet to announce the date of his resignation.", "description": "Outgoing Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has asked Parliament to help ensure that the \"dysfunctional\" Department of Home Affairs discharge is duties in terms of documenting foreign nationals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9500/8fb73fd29ac341f284f0e05f6225ea38.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
