It\u2019s Like This Weight\u2019: How the Clinton White House Handled Impeachment", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWe did compartmentalize,\u201d Sosnik recalls. \u201cSenior staff at 8 a.m. was almost like a Potemkin village, with no discussion of impeachment. It was all about the functioning of government. If you just went to that meeting and nothing else, you wouldn\u2019t know there was anything going on.\u201d At the same time, Sosnik says, \u201cit\u2019s hovering. It\u2019s like this weight. If you\u2019re in the middle of dealing with this stuff, then it\u2019s an unbelievable load and burden and never leaves you. It\u2019s like having a chronically ill family member.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in at least one especially fraught moment during the scandal, three of his colleagues recalled, Bowles simply threw up.\n\nGreg Craig, a longtime friend of the Clintons and a veteran Washington lawyer, was brought into the White House to help coordinate the work of the impeachment team. \u201cEverything that happened went through the prism of impeachment,\u201d he remembers, even as the president was conducting diplomacy between Israel and the Palestinian Authority at Wye River, Maryland, in October 1998. \u201cEverything that happened\u2014all the planning, all the thinking\u2014had to go through the prism of impeachment.\u201d\n\nJennifer Palmieri, then one of Lockhart\u2019s press deputies, recalls a particularly grim moment in December 1998 as she sat with Susan Brophy, the White House\u2019s internal lobbyist with the House of Representatives, learning one by one of the defection of the handful of Democrats who had decided to vote for articles of impeachment on the floor. \u201cIt just felt like it was all crumbling,\u201d Palmieri remembers. \u201cI would call and give the news to Joe, who was on Air Force One with the president on a trip home from Israel. One time I called him, and he\u2019s like, \u2018Did we lose Gephardt?\u2019\u201d\u2014meaning the House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.\n\nBrophy has a similar memory of that time, only her bad news was the slipping away of moderate House Republicans who Clinton had hoped would stand by him, such as then-Representative Jack Quinn of Buffalo, New York. \u201cClinton was in Israel, and Sosnik called me and I started to give him the rundown, and he said, \u2018I\u2019m going to hand the phone to the president,\u2019 and I told him, \u2018Mr. President, we lost Jack Quinn.\u2019 He knew what that meant.\u201d (Quinn, whose district was the most heavily Democratic of any Republican congressional district in the nation, had grown personally close to Clinton over Ireland and other issues, and his decision to vote for impeachment emboldened other GOP moderates to follow suit.)\n\nPerhaps the single most dangerous day for Clinton was Saturday, December 19, 1998, when the full House voted to impeach him. On the same day, the incoming Republican speaker, Bob Livingston of Louisiana, acknowledged an extramarital affair and resigned, challenging Clinton to do the same. Later that afternoon, congressional Democrats trooped to a pep rally on the White House lawn, where Clinton vowed to stay on the job. Still later that evening, the president returned to the lectern and summoned the press to announce the cessation of air strikes on Iraq\u2014Clinton had ordered them days earlier as punishment for Saddam Hussein\u2019s refusal to allow United Nations weapons inspectors to do their work\u2014prompting some Republican critics to accuse him of a \u201cwag the dog\u201d diversion.", "description": "Former staffers reflect on keeping a besieged administration from falling apart during a scandal.", "authors": ["Todd S.
