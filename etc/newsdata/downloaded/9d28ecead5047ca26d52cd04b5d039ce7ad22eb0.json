A positive index reading means activity is expanding.\n\nEconomists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected an index reading of 0.8.\n\nThe New York Fed said 30% of respondents reported business conditions improved from a month earlier, while 26% said they had worsened.\n\nThe index for future business conditions inched three points higher to 17.1 but remained below levels seen for much of the past few years, according to the survey.\n\nThe new orders index rose remained flat at 3.5, which points to a small increase in orders. Shipments rose seven points to 13 after reaching its lowest level in nearly three years.\n\nWrite to Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 15, 2019 08:38 ET (12:38 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
