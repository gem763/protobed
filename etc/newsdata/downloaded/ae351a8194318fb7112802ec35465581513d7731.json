Photo: Getty\n\nRetirement feels a long way off for many people, even those already a couple of decades into their working lives, but especially for younger generations.\n\nWith the state pension age pushed further back, the stagnation of incomes, and the high cost of living such as housing, retirement is just a pipe dream to many people.\n\nBut that\u2019s why it\u2019s more important than ever to get thinking about your pension\u2014and taking action too.\n\nWith the right mindset, retiring at 60 should not be out of the question for many people. But as the old scout saying goes: failing to prepare is preparing to fail.\n\nA 2018 survey by insurer Aviva of 2,100 employed people aged 22-65 found that just 32% were prioritising saving for retirement.\n\nFor the 22-30 age group, only 19% were saving money into a pension\u2014yet these are people who may have to wait until their 70s before they can receive a state pension, if they even get one at all.\n\nIf you harbour dreams of retiring early, you need to get your act together quickly. Here are five things to do if you want to retire at 60.\n\nPlan ahead\n\nIt is essential that you plan your path to early retirement fully and in detail.\n\nYou need to establish exactly how much you need to have saved by the time you hit 60, bearing in mind that you\u2019ve got a good chance of living well into your 80s, if not longer.\n\nThat means figuring out what your annual spending will be.\n\nWhat type of lifestyle do you want? Are you happy to live frugally if it means retiring sooner? Or do you want a life of luxury, jetting off to holiday and driving around in a brand new car?\n\nUnderstand your retirement goals so you know what needs to be done to achieve them, even if it means making some sacrifices, such as foregoing the odd luxury.\n\nCentral to that is the target size of your pension pot on retirement day.\n\nStart saving early\u2014and lots\n\nThe earlier you start saving, the larger your pension pot will likely be.\n\nIt\u2019s generally never too late to start saving, but you\u2019re at a huge advantage if you begin early\u2014and as close to the beginning of your working life as possible.\n\nIn truth, unless you have sizeable savings or assets already, you probably won\u2019t be able to retire at 60 unless you began saving early on in your career.\n\nSo save into a pension early, put away as much as you can afford\u2014every little helps\u2014and let compound interest work its magic.\n\nUse a pension calculator to estimate how much you must put aside each month from this point onwards to reach your target pension size at 60.\n\nIt might also make sense to consolidate your savings into one pension pot. This could save you money, generate larger returns, and make monitoring its performance easier.\n\nWatch your pension closely\n\nRetiring at 60 will require your pension to perform strongly over time. If your investments are not yielding the returns you need, it\u2019s time to rethink.\n\nYou should always stay focused on the long-term and try not to be spooked by short-term turbulence in the market.\n\nBut be vigilant about your pension. If performance over a certain time is poor, then consider taking action.\n\nYour investment decisions could mean the difference between retiring at 60 and retiring at 70.\n\nPay off your mortgage and downsize your home\n\nRetiring without debt is important. Many people have a mortgage hanging over them as they head into retirement so it\u2019s best to try to pay it off beforehand.\n\nDon\u2019t overstretch yourself to buy a bigger or more expensive home while you\u2019re working. Focus on clearing the mortgage.\n\nThen, when the time comes, sell up and downsize if you\u2019ve got more space than you need.\n\nThis could help you to clear any outstanding mortgage debt and unlock equity to use in your pension pot.\n\nThat cash injection could make up the difference and get you out onto the golf course.\n\nSeek professional advice\n\nMost important of all, seek professional financial advice.\n\nThese people know the ins and outs of investing, tax, retirement options, and saving plans.\n\nThey will help you to map out your retirement plan and to keep your goals realistic without you taking unnecessary risks.\n\nAnd they\u2019ll also help you to avoid falling into any traps or making poor decisions.\n\nIf you want to retire at 60, you\u2019ll need a helping hand to guide you there\u2014and that helping hand should be a financial adviser.", "description": "If you harbour dreams of retiring early, you need to get your act together quickly \u2013 here is what you need to do.", "authors": ["Yahoo Finance Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9NAJce9r8Hjk7RzrYqFkBA--~B/aD0zNzIwO3c9NTU4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/20a6aa50-cdbc-11e9-b7f7-5eac26651342", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
