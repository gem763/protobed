While many commentators point to changing consumer habits and new technology, business rates are a significant factor, as they make it harder for shops to compete and grow.\n\nToday we, Tesco and the Co-op, are calling on government to take urgent action to help our sector.\n\nA grand plan: Co-op's Steve Murrells (left) and Dave Lewis of Tesco are trying to save the High Street\n\nRetailers support 3m jobs across the UK and invest in communities up and down the country.\n\nTheir shops are at the heart of communities, creating vibrant high streets and precincts where people come together. Retailers also contribute 5 per cent of national income but they account for more than 10 per cent of corporate tax and a disproportionate 25 per cent of the nation's business rates bill.\n\nBusiness rates are taxes applied to the physical premises where a firm operates and they help pay for local services in communities. These rates for retailers have almost doubled in the past 20 years. There are Tesco and Co-op shops that are paying more than 50 per cent of the value of their property in tax.\n\nBut if you're a typical online business, operating out of a few warehouses scattered around the country, you can be paying much less.\n\nThis is not sustainable \u2013 all companies should be contributing their fair share to local taxes. Of course, some of the increased costs retailers face reflect positive changes in the sector.\n\nEmployee pay has risen in recent years, with most major retailers paying well above the National Living Wage.\n\nThere has also been an increase in flexible working, with staff having more control over when and how long they work. As employers of hundreds of thousands of people, we know that they are our greatest asset and one of the most important reasons our customers keep coming back.\n\nBy contrast, business rates are simply having a negative impact on the industry, making it harder for shops to compete. As profit margins reduce, businesses are unable to invest and grow.\n\nThis causes communities to stagnate rather than flourish. It also penalises those who most rely on shops \u2013 the elderly and those on lower incomes.\n\nWe have seen the damage that empty retail spaces can cause, isolating people and severing the connections that make our communities vibrant and cohesive.\n\nMoreover, as stores close, especially where they are the only one left in the area, access to fresh, quality food is made harder, often hitting those least able to cope.\n\nIt also makes the UK less competitive, as we now have the highest property taxes in Europe and the second-highest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It is twice as expensive to open a supermarket in the UK as it is in France, Germany or the Netherlands.\n\nAt a time when government is trying to boost the UK's position as an investment destination, cracking the problem of business rates is essential. We welcome the Treasury Select Committee's report on business rates today, which makes clear that the system is not working; that there is not a level playing field between online and bricks-and-mortar operations and that government needs to carefully consider reform of the system.\n\nWe propose a two-part shake-up to reduce the burden.\n\nFirst, cut business rates for all retailers by 20 per cent. Second, level the playing field on tax between online and high street shops by introducing an online sales levy of 2 per cent on the sale of physical goods.\n\nThe first measure is a reduction in rates for retailers \u2013 benefiting every shop in the UK. The second would mean the growing online sector pays 2 per cent of what they make from online purchases of goods, to contribute to local services, although there would be exemptions, such as a dispensation for small and medium firms.\n\nThese measures would be revenue-neutral, would stimulate investment in our communities and would upgrade the outdated rates system, so that all retailers (online or bricks-and-mortar) are contributing a fair sum to local taxes.\n\nSome worry that the 2 per cent levy would add to prices in your online shopping cart. But the tax is on the companies, not the customer, and the 20 per cent business rate tax reduction would support lower prices in shops.\n\nSome worry that the measures will stymie online retail, but they would only mean all retailers pay a similar proportion of tax and play their part in contributing to services.\n\nThe UK's shops, and the communities they support, face increasing challenges from rates, but it is not an insoluble problem.\n\nWe believe that, with the right action by policy makers, we can redress the balance, and breathe new life into our towns and cities, ensuring we continue to have bright and diverse businesses bringing communities together.", "description": "Today we, Tesco and the Co-op, are calling on government to take urgent action to help our sector.
