Experts say the increase is due to Pyongyang's campaign to boost fish harvests.\n\nIn this Monday, Oct. 7, 2019, photo released by the 9th Regional Japan Coast Guard Headquarters, North Korean fishermen ride on a lifeboat off the northwestern coast of the Noto Peninsula, Ishikawa prefecture, Japan.
