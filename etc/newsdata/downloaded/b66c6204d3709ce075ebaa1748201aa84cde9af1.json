The men were accused of filling the building in Oakland with so much clutter that it trapped people at an electronic music party nearly three years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in shock,\u201d said David Gregory, whose 20-year-old daughter Michela perished in the fast-moving fire. \u201cWe were hoping for justice, but we didn\u2019t get justice today.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nMichela Gregory and her 22-year-old boyfriend, Alex Vega, died when fire roared through the so- Ghost Ship warehouse, which had been illegally converted into a live-work space for artists and held events.\n\nThe building was packed with furniture, extension cords and other flammable material but had only two exits and no smoke detectors, fire alarms or sprinklers, prosecutors say.\n\nThe blaze killed many young people trapped on the illegally constructed second floor. Prosecutors said the victims received no warning and had little chance to escape down a narrow, ramshackle staircase.\n\nAlmena, 49, and Harris, 29, had pleaded no contest to manslaughter and were set to be sentenced last year to nine and six years in prison, respectively. But a judge threw out their pleas after many of the victims\u2019 families objected.\n\nVega\u2019s mother, Mary, was angry about Thursday\u2019s outcome but didn\u2019t regret the plea agreement getting tossed. She said she was glad that Harris served more than two years behind bars awaiting trial.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something. Doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s not going to bring my son back,\u201d Mary Vega said.\n\nProsecutors acknowledged the emotional toll of the trial on the victims\u2019 loved ones and said they would meet with families and others to evaluate their next steps in the case against Almena. He remains in custody and is due in court again Oct. 4.\n\nOne of Almena\u2019s attorneys, Brian Getz, broke down in tears, while another, Tony Serra, said he was pained and anguished but vowed to win the case.\n\n\u201cIn the next trial, we\u2019ll do better,\u201d Serra said. It may be hung again, or he may be acquitted, but we\u2019re not going to lose,\u201d\n\nAlmena, 49, was the master tenant of the warehouse and Harris, 29, acted like a manager by collecting rent and settling household disputes, prosecutors said.\n\nIn closing arguments, Alameda County Deputy District Attorney Autrey James said the men didn\u2019t obtain permits because they didn\u2019t want inspections and they violated the fire code by refusing to install safety devices.\n\nThe defendants argued that city workers were to blame for not raising concerns about fire hazards and said the fire was arson. Investigators have never found its cause, meaning arson cannot be ruled out.\n\nSerra, Almena\u2019s attorney, repeatedly brought up instances in which fire, police and other officials toured the two-story building and never said anything about it posing a danger.\n\nAlmena cried on his first day on the witness stand, saying that he felt remorse and sorrow for having fostered a space for artists. He said he would never have let his wife and three children live somewhere considered unsafe.\n\n\u201cI built something. I dreamed something, I invited, I attracted beautiful people into my space, and I\u2019m responsible for having this idea,\u201d Almena said.\n\nHarris\u2019 attorney, Curtis Briggs, argued that his client had no leadership role at the warehouse and that he had not even been there when Almena signed the lease in 2013.\n\nHarris testified that he performed menial tasks such as cleaning the communal space and pooling the monthly rent to reduce his rent. He described a free-floating space where every tenant built on or furnished the building as they saw fit and rejected prosecutors\u2019 characterization that the warehouse was a \u201cdeath trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have made sure my friends were not buried there,\u201d Harris said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A mistrial was declared for Max Harris and Derick Almena, who were charged after a fire struck a party at Ghost Ship warehouse in Oakland", "authors": ["Janie Har", "Olga R.
