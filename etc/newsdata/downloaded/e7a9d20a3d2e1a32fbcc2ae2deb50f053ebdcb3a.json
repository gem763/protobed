I believe this case is an opportunity to impose an exemplary sentence\u2026 to warn potential offenders that this is what could happen to them if they behave negligently,\" he said.\n\nIt was because of this, that he had denied Ramnarain bail pending appeal.\n\n'Unjustified and irrational'\n\nIn a document noting the appeal, Ramnarain's attorney Reg Thomas said the magistrate was wrong.\n\n\"He [Ramnarain] has been on bail throughout the trial and observed all conditions. Even the State did not oppose the granting of bail and placed on record that he was not a flight risk.\n\n\"It is common cause that he is not a risk to society. It is not disputed that he is employed, has roots in the community and, as a result of his incarceration, about eight people and their families will lose their jobs and livelihood.\"\n\nThomas said he had not been found to be \"grossly negligent or reckless\", but simply that he had failed to keep a proper look-out.\n\nHe said the exemplary sentence was \"unjustified and irrational\" and that the magistrate was punishing his client by refusing to grant bail, especially because his appeal could succeed, and he would have served jail time unnecessarily.\n\nThe matter will be set down for argument before a judge in the Durban High Court.\n\nCaro Smith, of South Africans Against Drunk Driving (SADD) congratulated Magistrate Maharaj for the sentence.\n\n\"We hope others will follow his lead to help deter these preventable and costly (both financial and emotional) crimes on our roads,\" she said.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Omesh Ramnarain, the motorist who was sentenced to 10 years in jail for killing two cyclists, wants to be released on bail, pending an appeal against his sentence and conviction on two counts of culpable homicide.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7450/df6729a816c44f61bf2307b034eb1af6.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-04"}
