He added that he asked why that was the case, and was not given a specific reason.\n\n\u201cMy experience has been that when the president loses confidence in an ambassador, no matter what the reason, that the president\u2019s confidence in his ambassador in a Capitol is the coin of the realm, the most important thing for that ambassador,\u201d Sullivan told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nSullivan also told lawmakers that he became aware of a packet of information about Yovanovitch that was supplied to the State Department counsel. He said it was told he came from \u201csomeone at the White House\u201d but that he didn\u2019t know who was responsible for producing the packet.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t provide, to me, a basis for us taking action against our ambassador,\u201d Sullivan said of the packet. But he said \u201cto be cautious\u201d he asked the Justice Department or the State Department Inspector General to look at the materials.\n\nThe State Department inspector general furnished the documents, which sought to bolster unproven allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenWhite House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report Biden uses National Cat Day to fundraise for putting a 'pet back in White House' Sondland emerges as key target after Vindman testimony MORE, to Congress earlier this month.

A source with knowledge told The Hill in early October that Pompeo \u201cnever promised Rudy Giuliani that he would investigate the contents of the envelope or anything related to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch, a career diplomat, was recalled from her post in Ukraine in May, around the same time Giuliani acknowledged he was pursuing information in Ukraine that could be damaging to President Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nHer dismissal came under fresh scrutiny following the release of a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nOn the call, Trump describes Yovanovitch as \u201cbad news\u201d and was \u201cgoing to go through some things.\u201d Zelensky told Trump that he agreed Yovanovitch was a \u201cbad ambassador,\u201d according to the White House memo.\n\nSullivan said Wednesday he did not know what Trump meant when he called Yovanovitch \u201cbad news.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters on the day of Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony that he didn\u2019t know her, sidestepping a question about whether he put pressure to have her removed as ambassador to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cShe may be very much a wonderful woman. If you remember the phone call I had with the President -- the new President -- he didn\u2019t speak favorably. But I just don\u2019t know her. She may be a wonderful woman,\u201d Trump said, referencing his phone call with Zelensky at the center of the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nUkraine policy was brought up multiple times in the course of Sullivan\u2019s confirmation hearing, particularly in the context of Russian intervention in Crimea.\n\nSeveral witnesses have testified in connection with the House impeachment inquiry, describing an unusual second channel directing foreign policy toward Ukraine that included Giuliani, former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerAdministration official to testify Bolton painted Giuliani as possible obstacle on Ukraine policy The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Dems unveil impeachment measure; Vindman splits GOP The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - ISIS leader dead; Congresswoman resigns MORE, Energy Secretary Rick Perry Rick PerryThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - ISIS leader dead; Congresswoman resigns Timeline: Trump, Ukraine and impeachment Bolton looms large as impeachment inquiry accelerates MORE and U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\nSullivan said Wednesday it wouldn\u2019t be unusual to have officials outside the State Department working on foreign policy, noting Perry\u2019s participation would be relevant given his work on energy issues with Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Sullivan said that it would be problematic to have more than one channel working on foreign policy, saying it creates difficulty for the secretary of state in maintaining control over it.\n\n\u201cI think we normally assume everyone is pursuing the same policies when we have different channels of communications to a country,\u201d said Sen.
