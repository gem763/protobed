That\u2019s when he heard the news of yet another school shooting. Seventeen people died that day at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\n\u201cWhen we heard the students\u2019 rallying cry, \u2018enough is enough\u2019 it really got to us,\u201d Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods CEO and Chairman Ed Stack told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe felt like we had to take a stand.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS), the biggest sporting goods retailer in the country, completely stopped selling guns to customers younger than 21 and removed assault rifles and high-capacity magazines from all of its stores.\n\nThe company originally tried to ban assault rifles back in 2012 after the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting. But after customer backlash, they put the guns back on the shelves at its Field & Stream stores, some of which the company has sold.\n\nThe Parkland shooting was a turning point for Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. Stack discovered the shooter bought a shotgun from the company in November of 2017. \u201cIt was not the gun, nor the type of gun, he used in the shooting\u2014 but it could have been,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\n\u201cMass shootings had become an all-too-familiar part of life in America,\u201d Stack wrote in his new book \u201cIt\u2019s How We Play The Game.\u201d \u201cTheir frequency seemed to be increasing and there seemed to be no end to it\u2014 and maybe worse, no one trying to deal with it.\u201d\n\nDestroying $5 million worth of guns\n\nBut Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods continued to take action. In April 2018, the company said it planned to destroy all military-style rifles it took off its shelves after the Parkland shooting rather than allowing them to sell at another retailer. Since then, the company destroyed $5 million worth of its gun inventory and turned it into scrap metal.\n\n\u201cIf you see a problem and you have an expertise on the problem and you have a sense of the solution, you should stand up and say something and that\u2019s what we did,\u201d Stack said.\n\nStack also said the new restrictions on guns will cost the company about a quarter of a billion dollars in revenue. For the fiscal year ending Feb. 2, 2019, same-store sales fell 3.1%, according to company earnings, and Stack blamed a lot of it on gun issues.\n\nThe entrance to the Dick's Sporting Goods store is seen in Glendale, California on February 28, 2018. Dick's, one of the nation's largest sports retailers, said February 28 that it was immediately ending sales of all assault-style rifles in its stores. The retailer also said that it would no longer sell high-capacity magazines and that it would not sell any gun to anyone under 21 years of age, regardless of local laws. / AFP PHOTO / Robyn Beck (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images) More\n\nStack is among the 144 corporate executives that signed a letter urging Congress to expand background checks and issue stronger gun control laws in September.\n\n\u201cThe American people are looking for leadership\u2014and they\u2019re not getting it in Washington,\u201d Stack said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to the private sector and we need to do something.\u201d\n\nSince the move by Dick\u2019s, in September Walmart announced that it would reduce gun and ammunition sales and request that customers no longer openly carry guns into their stores.\n\nValentina Caval is a producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Dick's Sporting Goods CEO Ed Stack explains his decision to restrict gun sales at the company.", "authors": ["Valentina Caval"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UOflAUTrWQ1N2VlxV1aPNw--~B/aD0zNDkxO3c9NTEyNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b7e603d0-ea0d-11e9-b7fe-551e3cd6e238", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
