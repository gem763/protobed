After his hiring, the sheriff's office adjusted its regulations to allow him to wear a beard and a turban as an observant Sikh.\n\nDhaliwal\u2019s dashboard camera showed the officer speaking with the driver in an apparently normal tone with \u201cno combat, no arguing,\u201d Sheriff\u2019s Maj. Mike Lee said.\n\nAfter Dhaliwal turned to walk back to his patrol car, the driver got out of his vehicle and \"almost immediately running with a gun already out,\u201d Lee said, the Houston Chronicle reports. The driver shot the deputy at least twice from behind in the head, returned to his car and drove away.\n\nDhaliwal died after being airlifted to a hospital.\n\nIn this Aug. 30, 2015, photo, Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal, center, is seen during a memorial for Deputy Darren Goforth in Houston.

He called Dhaliwal \"a hero, a trailblazer.\"\n\nRobert Solis, 47, of Houston, was charged Friday night with capital murder in the killing. He was wanted for parole violation involving an alleged assault on a girlfriend. .\n\nAt a court hearing Saturday morning, prosecutors said a female passenger in Solis' car had been allowed to leave the vehicle before the incident. She later told officers that she went to her father's house, where Solis called her.\n\nThe unidentified woman, according to prosecutors, \"said (Solis) had shot a police officer\" but that she did not believe him.\n\nTipped by a witness, officers tracked Solis' car to a grocery parking lot in the area. Surveillance video showed that the suspect had ditched a handgun in a sidewalk trash can, where it was recovered by police.\n\nDeputy Sandeep Dhaliwal beamed with pride when then-Sheriff @AdrianGarciaHTX announced he could wear his Sikh turbin and a beard while on duty. #hounews pic.twitter.com/BN3wnqYoCP \u2014 HCSOTexas (@HCSOTexas) September 27, 2019\n\nThe prosecutors said Solis, who was spotted near the store, became agitated when approached by police and refused to identify himself.\n\nDhaliwal, a father of three young children, joined the force 10 years ago when then-Sheriff Adrian Garcia sought to improve relations with the Sikh community after a domestic violence call at a Sikh family's home was badly handled by deputies.\n\n\"He was a walking lesson in tolerance and understanding, which are values Houstonians uphold here in the nation\u2019s most diverse big city,\" said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner.\n\nThis photo provided by Harris County Sheriff's office shows Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal. Dhaliwal was shot and killed while making a traffic stop Friday, Sept. 27, 2019 near Houston. Robert Solis, 47, of Houston, was charged Friday night with capital murder in the slaying.
