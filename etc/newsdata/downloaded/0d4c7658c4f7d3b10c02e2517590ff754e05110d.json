The new costume to be worn by actresses portraying the character is long-sleeved, with a neckline that rests at the collarbone.\n\n\u201cDisney has slowly been rolling out brand new costumes for all the princesses in the park, and Jasmine\u2019s one of the last to get a new look,\u201d Hello Giggles said. \u201cWhile obviously an updated wardrobe is never a bad thing, according to those in the Disney Princess know, one of the main reasons for this change is that many were complaining about Jasmine showing her stomach \u2014 which is totally understandable, especially taking young body-conscious girls into consideration.\u201d\n\nThe Jasmine character in particular has been under fire from feminists as well as Muslim critics in recent years as an offensive role model unworthy of showcasing to impressionable young girls.\n\n\u201cThe majority of Princess Jasmine\u2019s numerous flaws stem from the fact that she is completely inaccurate and offensive to her culture. From the clothes she wears to the way she speaks, Jasmine does not represent Arab or Muslim women at all but rather a disgraceful woman in their culture. Unfortunately, Jasmine is not a suitable role model for young girls,\u201d complained a woman writing at FanPop.com last year.\n\n\u201cHad Jasmine been portrayed more accurately, she would\u2019ve been far more like Cinderella, Ariel or Belle. She would\u2019ve been braver, kinder and more modest. She would\u2019ve had more grace and poise the way a princess should. The most accurate Jasmine was portrayed in Aladdin was in her purple royal engagement announcement dress. That is the Jasmine who should be sold to the little girls. Not the spoiled, impulsive, shrew-like tease version of her.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
