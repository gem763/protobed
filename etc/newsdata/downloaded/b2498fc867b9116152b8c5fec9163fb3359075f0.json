In their presidential election, Argentines put it to a vote.", "language": "en", "text": "Macri took office in December 2015 promising pro-market reforms that he said would bring immediate and solid economic growth for 20 years. But at the end of his four-year term, poverty has increased by some 10 percentage points, annual inflation is over 50 percent and the public debt is equal to 100 percent of GDP, on the verge of default.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Fern\u00e1ndez-Kirchner ticket, drawing support from the poor and outside the capital, defeated Macri and running mate Miguel \u00c1ngel Pichetto (a right-wing Peronista) in Argentina\u2019s all-parties primary in August, 47.8 percent to 31.8 percent. The same vote on Sunday would give the Peronistas an outright victory, without need of a second round.\n\nThat was Ra\u00fal Montoya\u2019s hope. The 70-year-old computer consultant cast his ballot Sunday for Fern\u00e1ndez and Kirchner.\n\n\u201cI do trust in market-friendly policies, but Macri promised the earth four years ago,\u201d Montoya said outside his polling station in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Caballito. He said the charges against Kirchner were politically motivated. Peronism, he said, \u201crespects the rules of the market without leaving people to their own fate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Esther Rosas feared the return of Peronism \u2014 and, in particular, Kirchner.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI hope they don\u2019t retaliate,\u201d the 83-year-old pensioner said after voting for Macri in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Villa Crespo. \u201cCristina is arrogant and corrupt.\u201d\n\nStill, she said, she understood popular frustration with the incumbent: \u201cMacri is a good engineer, but he tried to help only businessmen, forgetting the rest.\u201d\n\nResults were expected late Sunday.\n\nMacri, who held top positions in several businesses before running for office, faces federal charges himself on accusations that he tried to benefit his family\u2019s firms. He has denied wrongdoing and blames the charges on the influence of Kirchner on judges and prosecutors. Kirchner also denies wrongdoing and blames Macri for the cases against her.\n\nAD\n\nArgentina, a nation of 44 million, has the third-largest economy in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico.\n\nAD\n\nKirchner, a former two-term president and first lady, is the current face of Peronism, the populist political machine created in the 1940s by Juan and Eva \u201cEvita\u201d Per\u00f3n that has returned to power periodically ever since, with mixed results. In Kirchner\u2019s second term, from 2011 to 2015, a stagnant economy stopped generating employment, inflation hit 25 percent, the fiscal deficit reached 5 percent and the country had no access to external financing.\n\nMacri\u2019s election in 2015 was widely seen as a milestone for Argentina and Latin America: For the first time, a conservative candidate who proposed market orthodoxy to guarantee \u201csustainable growth\u201d defeated a Peronist-led coalition that had pursued protectionist policies, expanded public spending and implemented a wide net of social assistance.\n\nKirchner\u2019s unusual decision to run as the vice presidential candidate to Fern\u00e1ndez was seen by some as a recognition that although she has a loyal base, she is still deeply disliked by many voters and has a low electoral ceiling. Fern\u00e1ndez, a chief of staff to her late husband and presidential predecessor N\u00e9stor Kirchner, left the administration a few months after Cristina Kirchner took office, and became critical of her in the intervening decade.\n\nAfter the Fern\u00e1ndez-Kirchner primary win in August, Macri announced tax cuts for the middle class, salary increases, social benefits and a fuel price freeze. The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, suspended the last tranche of a record $57 billion deal that represents more than 60 percent of the IMF\u2019s credit portfolio.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMoody\u2019s foresaw high probabilities of a sovereign default next year even if Macri were reelected.\n\nMacri reduced the primary deficit in the last year, but significantly increased the burden of debt service, which returns the fiscal deficit similar to that left by Kirchner in 2015, according to Carlos Melconi\u00e1n, head of the Macroview consultancy firm.\n\nInflation hit 5.9 percent in September. By the end of the year, poverty will hit 40 percent, according to the Observatory of Social Debt at the Catholic University of Argentina. (The percentage is not comparable to others in Latin America because the poverty line in Argentina is based on higher standards.)\n\nAD\n\nMassive protests against austerity measures in Chile and Ecuador and the electoral conflict in Bolivia weighed on Argentine public opinion in the days leading up to the vote. But while Argentina is suffering a recession reminiscent of its economic meltdown at the turn of the century, the campaign proceeded in relative calm. Macri and Fern\u00e1ndez headed massive rallies without significant incident.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMass demonstrations are something common in Argentina, but the system of political parties has worked well in this country for many years, and that provides a certain stability,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Esperanza Casullo, a political scientist at the University of Rio Negro in Patagonia.\n\nThe Fernandez-Kirchner and Macri-Pichetto tickets led a field of six. To win in the first round, a ticket must capture a plurality with more than 45 percent of the vote, or 40 percent and a 10-point lead. If no ticket achieved either result, a runoff would be held next month.\n\nCasullo said the next president risks the rapid deterioration of his approval rating.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cArgentine society is deeply anti\u00adhegemonic,\u201d she said. \u201cIf expectations are not met, people punish those who fail to meet their expectations.\u201d\n\nBut she predicted the Peronistas would remain united, \u201cbecause these years of Macri in office were really painful for them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEduardo Fidanza, director of the political consulting firm Poliarquia, predicted Argentines would allow Fern\u00e1ndez and Kirchner a honeymoon. But he said they would have to clarify who was in charge. The running mates disagreed publicly on several points before resuming their old friendship in 2017.\n\nPeronism has majorities in the Congress, Fidanza noted, and maintains links with union leaders, industrial entrepreneurs and the Catholic Church.\n\nAD\n\nMacri pledged to strengthen democracy and ethics in government. Casullo said he was \u201cnaive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality proved to be more difficult than magically getting results by only removing the Kirchnerites,\u201d she said. \u201cMacri relied too much on slogans, underestimating what claims for an independent judiciary, a plural press and the respect of human rights really represent for many Argentines.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLula Gonz\u00e1lez contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Cristina Kirchner and the Peronistas were poised for a return to power Sunday.", "authors": ["Sebasti\u00e1n Lacunza"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JBtyIa-ADIkBD3mzA55cbEsw29Y=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FVFZSJHY4UI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
