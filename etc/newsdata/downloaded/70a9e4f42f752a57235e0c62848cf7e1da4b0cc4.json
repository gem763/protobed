It\u2019s unwarranted and dangerous, and it represents a threat to a free press in this country.\u201d\n\nJust hours earlier, Trump railed against Rucker and Parker in a tweet, calling them \u201ctwo nasty lightweight reporters\u201d who \u201cshouldn\u2019t even be allowed on the grounds of the White House because their reporting is so DISGUSTING & FAKE.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s @PhilipRucker (Mr. Off the Record) & @AshleyRParker, two nasty lightweight reporters, shouldn\u2019t even be allowed on the grounds of the White House because their reporting is so DISGUSTING & FAKE.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\nTrump was referring to the reporters\u2019 article published Sept. 1, the headline of which read: \u201cTrump\u2019s lost summer: Aides claim victory, but others see incompetence and intolerance.\u201d\n\nThe story noted Trump\u2019s racist smears of several congresswomen of color, as well as the insults the president hurled at the majority-black city of Baltimore, which he labeled \u201crat and rodent infested.\u201d It also mentioned that echoes of Trump\u2019s xenophobic rhetoric surfaced in a white supremacist manifesto believed to have been written by a Texas shooter who killed 22 people at an El Paso Walmart in August.\n\nTrump\u2019s erratic Twitter habits have sent markets \u201cping-ponging,\u201d the Post noted, and his \u201cwhipsaw diplomacy at the Group of Seven summit left allies uncertain about American leadership.\u201d\n\nThe White House rejected the report on Thursday. Two of Trump\u2019s frontline defenders \u2015 press secretary Stephanie Grisham and principal deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley \u2015 came out swinging with an op-ed in the conservative Washington Examiner, which was mockingly titled, \u201cThe Washington Post\u2019s lost summer.\u201d\n\nGrisham and Gidley\u2019s remarks, which Trump shared, labeled the Post\u2019s report an \u201copinion article,\u201d claiming it pushed the two journalists\u2019 \u201cown personal political narrative.\u201d\n\nThe piece argued that instead, the Post story should have focused more on Trump\u2019s accomplishments.", "description": "The paper's executive editor defended two of its reporters after Trump suggested banning them from the White House.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7409c9230000980251273c.jpeg?cache=dflvcdqjhm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
