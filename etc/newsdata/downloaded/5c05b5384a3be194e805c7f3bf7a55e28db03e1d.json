Trump Doral is a world-class facility, with an unrivaled hospitality team and we are honored by this recognition.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident @realDonaldTrump shares the location of the next @G7 summit, hosted by the United States! pic.twitter.com/CMtHG2Dump \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 26, 2019\n\nPresident Trump announced in August 2019 the possibility of holding the G-7 at Trump National Doral saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful place. It\u2019s a very very successful area of Florida.\u201d\n\nThe president explained that his golf resort is close to Miami International Airport and is large enough, 800 acres, to host the international leaders and delegates that would attend.\n\nBut Trump National Doral has suffered financially since Trump took office. Financial disclosures show Doral generated just under $76 million dollars in revenue last year, down from the $116 million it generated in 2016.\n\nEric Trump insists neither The Trump Organization nor his father are using Donald Trump\u2019s presidency to turn a profit.\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s a prideful guy,\u201d Eric Trump said. \u201cYou know, he built something incredible and you know there\u2019s a comfort level there. And he would like to show hospitality to these countries like they do to us.\u201d\n\nBookbinder disagrees. \u201cThe President and his family have consistently and shamelessly used the presidency to promote their properties,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just the latest and most brazen example.\u201d\n\nAdam Shapiro is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "The Trump administration announced plans to host the 2020 G-7 Summit at the President's golf club in Miami Florida but critics say the Trump family is profiting off taxpayers who will payt the bill.", "authors": ["Adam Shapiro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sz.GCpZexiGKf2xgmoM_Cg--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTEzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/1ec209f0-c4f7-11e9-bac5-1f116711132a", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
