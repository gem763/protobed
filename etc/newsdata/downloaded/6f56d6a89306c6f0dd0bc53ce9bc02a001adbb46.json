In his Chelsea studio, he\u2019s drawn the Pope having sex with Mary Whitehouse, Harold Macmillan naked in the pose of Christine Keeler . . . and countless other ruthless takedowns. Bernard Levin called him a \u2018candidate for the position of the first man to be prosecuted simultaneously for obscenity, blasphemy and criminal libel\u2019.\n\nSunday Times and Evening Standard political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe has published his autobiography 'Long Drawn Out Trip'\n\nIn the first film he directed, Scarfe On Scarfe, he showed a drawing of the Rhodesian premier Ian Smith hanging the Queen by the neck. Shortly afterwards, Scarfe met Princess Anne at a charity event. \u2018I really enjoyed your TV programme,\u2019 she said, \u2018but did I see Mummy hanging from a tree?\u2019\n\nIn this compelling, but tightly controlled, memoir, he likes to blow his own trumpet, quoting letters and articles praising him. I did have a slight \u2018pot-calling-kettle-black\u2019 feeling when he harangued politicians for being egotistical, thick-skinned and ambitious.\n\nHe\u2019s still fuming at having been let go by The Sunday Times after 50 years, aged 81, and lets us know that he was snapped up by the Evening Standard.\n\nScarfe explains in his introduction that he\u2019s going to keep his personal life out of this memoir, although he does frequently refer to his current wife, Jane Asher, the glamorous actress and cake-maker. But there\u2019s no mention, not a squeak, of the mothers of his first two children, Maureen or children\u2019s author Marcia Williams. So this is very much a selective memoir.\n\nThe childhood chapters are extremely moving. Gerry\u2019s first 16 years were blighted by debilitating asthma, requiring him to take weeks off school every term.\n\nHe\u2019s still fuming at having been let go by The Sunday Times after 50 years, aged 81, and lets us know that he was snapped up by the Evening Standard\n\nHe was rushed to hospital in the middle of the night, gasping for breath; he was made to wear a plastic mouth-plate to aid breathing; a sadistic male nurse made him stand naked in a white-tiled room and hosed him with needle-sharp jets of cold water, \u2018as though I was being sliced by an open razor as the laser-like jet traced down my back on to my buttocks\u2019. A few reasons for the lifelong anger, then.\n\nHe went along to St Martin\u2019s School of Art aged 15, forgetting his portfolio. The interviewer said he was too young. Scarfe writes: \u2018I feel that if he had seen my drawings, I would have become a student at St Martin\u2019s.\u2019 He\u2019s probably right.\n\nAlso powerful in those opening chapters is Scarfe\u2019s portrayal of his compulsion to draw. Aged ten, Gerry was taken by his father to see Disney\u2019s Pinocchio. He drew all the characters endlessly.\n\n\u2018I could never have imagined that I would one day be the only outside artist to be production designer on a Disney movie.\u2019 (Hercules.)\n\nScarfe\u2019s first success was winning a competition by The Eagle in which David Hockney was the runner-up.\n\nHe whisks us from the boredom of his first job in advertising to the relief at being free to let rip when Punch and then Private Eye took him on.\n\nIn the Sixties, he was lured to the Daily Mail with a Jaguar E-Type. The paper sent him round the world as a reportage illustrator, where he drew the horror of the Vietnam war and a cholera outbreak in Calcutta.\n\nPushing boundaries, he began making sculptures of his cartoons. His son told his teacher: \u2018At home, we have a dog, three cats, a goldfish and two naked Mrs Thatchers.\u2019\n\nThis vigorous sculpting led to him designing sets for Pink Floyd concerts. A Bafta for Scarfe On Scarfe led to him being suddenly sought after as a film director.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to keep the ego at bay when you\u2019re both feted by the whole world and married to Jane Asher.\n\nBut always, Scarfe says, he has suffered from a lack of self-confidence, as well as sensitivity about his status as a true artist.\n\n\u2018One only has to go into a Chelsea house,\u2019 he writes, \u2018to see that the real art is hanging in the drawing room and the cartoons are hung in the lavatory.\u2019\n\nOn the jacket of this memorable, but frustrating, book, Scarfe has drawn himself as a jester holding a quill pen. It\u2019s far milder than his cartoons of other people.\n\nIt would require a more ruthless cartoonist to capture the man who tells the truth, and nothing but the truth, but not the whole truth.", "description": "Former Sunday Times and Evening Standard political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe has published his autobiography, revealing how he became a ruthless diminisher of power.", "authors": ["Ysenda Maxtone Graham For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19558950-0-image-a-25_1570741151109.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
