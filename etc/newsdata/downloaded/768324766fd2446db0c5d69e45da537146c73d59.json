So to be able to be a part of that was awesome.\u201d\n\nHudson said he was grateful that the Nationals, including manager Dave Martinez, backed his decision to take a short paternity leave to be with his wife, Sara, for the birth in Phoenix of baby Millie \u2014 their third daughter.\n\nThe decision sparked predictable barbs on social media, many from worried fans. Former Miami Marlins president David Samson weighed in on Twitter, condemning Hudson\u2019s absence.\n\nAs he watched the game with family on Friday night, Hudson said, the negative comments were \u201chard to ignore\u201d.\n\n\u201cI went from not having a job on March 21 to this huge national conversation on family values going into the playoffs,\u201d he said. \u201cLife comes at you fast. I don\u2019t know how that happened and how I became the face for whatever conversation was going on.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the Nationals managed just fine without Hudson on Friday, thanks in large part to starting pitcher Anibal Sanchez\u2019s stellar game.\n\nSanchez took a no-hitter into the eighth inning and reliever Sean Doolittle then came in to record the last four outs in a 2-0 triumph.\n\nIn a late-night text message to Hudson, Martinez suggested a name for the newest addition to his family in tribute: \u201cAnibella Sean.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife got a good kick out of that,\u201d Hudson said.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Washington Nationals closing pitcher Daniel Hudson was back on duty in time for Game Two of the National League Championship", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/31c442_nationals-reliever-daniel-hudson-is-team-missing-game-one-attend-birth-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
