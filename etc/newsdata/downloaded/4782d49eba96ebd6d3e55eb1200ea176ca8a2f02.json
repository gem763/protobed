On Monday, as he met foreign leaders on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr Trump insisted he had done nothing wrong. He sought to turn the focus onto Mr Biden.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden and his son are corrupt. If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they\u2019d be getting the electric chair right now,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cI did not make a statement that \u2018you have to do this or I\u2019m not going to give you aid\u2019. I wouldn\u2019t do that. I wouldn\u2019t do that.\n\n\u201cThere was no pressure put on them whatsoever. I put no pressure on them whatsoever. I could have. I think it probably, possibly would have been OK if I did,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Trump suggested the White House might release a transcript of the conversation, though he said he worried that it might set a precedent. Later, he wrote on Twitter that Fox News had \"bombshell information\" that suggested the whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of that phone conversation.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Politico reported that congressman Dean Phillips of Minnesota became the first centrist Democrat to announce support for Mr Trump\u2019s ouster if he had urged the Ukrainian government to investigate his political rival.\n\n\u201cIf the reports are corroborated, we must pursue articles of impeachment and report them to the full House of Representatives for immediate consideration,\u201d Mr Phillips said.\n\nIn a letter to her colleagues on Sunday, House speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote: \u201cIf the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u201d\n\nA number of Democrats, among them Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, believe Ms Pelosi, 79, is being too timid and have called for the party to move forward with Mr Trump\u2019s impeachment. Ms Pelosi is calculating the move could backfire and hurt Democrats\u2019 fortunes in 2020 as there is little support among the public.\n\nMeanwhile, congressional Democrats demanded documents from the White House about the Mr Trump team\u2019s contacts with Ukraine.\n\nThree House committees \u2013 intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight \u2013 called on secretary of state Mike Pompeo to produce documents related to contacts between Mr Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Democratic-led committees said in a letter that they \u201cjointly request documents related to reported efforts by President Trump and his associates to improperly pressure the Ukrainian government to assist the president\u2019s bid for re-election\u201d. They warned they wanted to hear from Mr Pompeo by Thursday to know to whether to obtain subpoenas.\n\nHunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings in April 2014, two months after Ukraine\u2019s Russia-friendly former president was ousted by protesters, and as the US vice president was heavily involved in US efforts to support the new pro-western government.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Joe Biden has called on\u00a0Donald Trump to release the transcript of a controversial conversation with the leader of Ukraine, as pressure mounted on Democrats to move forward with impeachment.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/19/biden-transcript.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
