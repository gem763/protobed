What\u2019s behind the climate catastrophe headlines\n\nThe conference\u2019s agenda has been slammed for turning the Church into a \u201csecular NGO with an ecological-social-psychological mandate\u201d by some Catholics, including Cardinal Walter Brandm\u00fcller, who views it as a Trojan horse for political meddling.\n\nThe synod\u2019s working document admits that Catholic missionaries took part in the colonization of the Amazon region, but attempts to expiate the Church\u2019s guilt for atrocities committed by the early colonizers by aligning itself with the remaining indigenous people \u2013 centuries after the fact \u2013 against their government. It bemoans \u201cclimate change and the increase in human intervention\u201d for \u201cdriving the Amazon towards a point of no return.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday the Church \u2026 has the historic opportunity to differentiate itself from the new colonizing powers by listening to the Amazon peoples,\u201d the document proclaims, decrying the \u201cviolation of the rights of indigenous peoples\u201d and proclaiming solidarity with \u201cthe peoples of the Amazon, especially the poor and the culturally different.\u201d Those \u201cisolated peoples\u201d with no contact with civilization \u2013 or Catholicism \u2013 are especially singled out for the Church\u2019s protection.\n\nThe Church may decry colonialist predators, but it\u2019s not acting all that different from a colonizer itself, openly discussing the \u201cchallenge\u201d of \u201chow to recover the Amazon territory, rescue it from neocolonial degradation and restore its authentic and healthy well-being.\u201d Brazil, which contains most of the Amazon, is a heavily Catholic nation led by a president determined to open the rainforest up to farmers, miners, and any other industries that can turn a tidy profit. The Church appears determined to override that government\u2019s authority in the name of saving the planet (and a few souls in the bargain). Swathing itself in moral righteousness, it pledges to \u201cdemand the protection of the areas\u201d where its helpless new charges live and \u201cplan joint pastoral action in border regions,\u201d where it will push governments to \u201crespond to the needs and rights of migrants.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Top Polish Catholic archbishop urges against \u2018ideological totalitarianism\u2019 in LGBT debate\n\nIt\u2019s easy for the Church to slam \u201cthe idolatry of money\u201d \u2013 the Vatican has more money than many countries. It\u2019s not so easy for a Brazilian logger to give up his livelihood for the sake of sustainability. Though perhaps the Church would like to see him become a priest?\n\nAs if shoehorning climate change into Catholic doctrine wasn\u2019t controversial enough for one synod, the conference is also mulling doing away with the celibacy requirement for the priesthood \u2013 complaining that some 70 percent of those living in the Amazon region are unable to take part in Catholic ritual because there aren\u2019t enough priests.\n\nThe Catholic Church has a long and honorable history of helping the poor, and many of its motives may be noble. But it also has a long and less-than-honorable history of political meddling. Elevating environmentalism to the level of religious doctrine is an example of the latter. As Catholics fear the Amazon synod is \"formalizing heresy,\" governments should be wary of science that has to be taken on faith.\n\nBy Helen Buyniski, RT\n\nLike this story?
