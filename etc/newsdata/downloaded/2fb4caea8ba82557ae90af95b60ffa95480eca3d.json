REUTERS/Anshuman Daga/File Photo\n\nA deal would see Singapore-based Grab buy a majority interest in Ant-backed DANA from Indonesian media conglomerate Elang Mahkota Teknologi (Emtek) and merge it with OVO, they said.\n\nIt could help OVO-DANA dominate Gojek in Indonesia\u2019s multi-billion dollar online payments market. OVO and Gojek have been vying for the top spot in payments since 2018, with DANA not far behind.\n\nGrab and Gojek are the top-two startup brands in Southeast Asia, valued at $14 billion and $10 billion, respectively, according to sources. They compete in a host of areas including financial services, e-commerce, ride-hailing and food delivery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the Grab-Gojek battle,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nThe plan also points to intensifying competition in Indonesia\u2019s digital payments industry that is seeking to piggyback on the country\u2019s booming e-commerce market and its 260 million people.\n\nGrab and OVO declined to comment, while DANA said it does not comment on market rumours. The people declined to be named as the talks are private and remain at an early stage.\n\nEmtek, Ant Financial, and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how much a deal would be worth. Finance Asia, citing sources, put OVO\u2019s latest valuation at $2.9 billion. DANA\u2019s valuation could not be immediately determined.\n\nThe overall structure of the deal would need to be negotiated with the country\u2019s central bank due to foreign ownership restrictions, the sources said.\n\nGrab\u2019s exact ownership of OVO could not be ascertained but sources said it owns a sizable stake. Emtek currently owns over 50% of the company that owns DANA, which was formed in 2017 through a tie-up with Ant.\n\nThe talks for a merger follow SoftBank Group Corp\u2019s announcement in July it will invest $2 billion in Indonesia through Grab.\n\nSoftBank, Grab\u2019s biggest shareholder, supports the proposal, sources said. The plan was discussed with top Indonesian officials when the Japanese investment firm\u2019s CEO Masayoshi Son visited Jakarta in July, a source with knowledge of those discussions said.\n\n\u201cSon is in favor,\u201d the person said.\n\nANT\u2019S ANGST\n\nSoftBank is a key link Grab has been leveraging to expand in the region, with Grab founder Anthony Tan using the connection to convince Indonesian e-commerce firm Tokopedia, backed by SoftBank and Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba, to take a minority stake in OVO earlier this year, the sources said. Tokopedia said it does not comment on rumours.\n\nBut Ant Financial, a financial services affiliate of Alibaba, has reservations about the deal due to differences over valuations and as it also wants to take a lead in digital payment expansion in the region, the sources said.\n\nAnt also fears the deal may unsettle similar payment partnerships it has with local partners in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, they said.\n\nCompanies find the Indonesian market for digital payments promising. More than half of Indonesians don\u2019t have bank accounts, and they increasingly use smartphones for transactions.\n\nLocal payment firms have attracted huge interest from foreign tech giants whose expansion drive in Indonesia has been deterred by tough licensing regulations.\n\nReuters reported last month that Facebook Inc\u2019s messenger service WhatsApp is in talks with multiple Indonesian digital payment firms to offer their mobile transaction services.\n\nOVO, also owned by Indonesian conglomerate Lippo, is the official payments partner of Grab in the country, while Gojek has backing from strategic investors such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Visa.\n\nDANA, originally created to be embedded in the once massively popular chat app Blackberry Messenger in 2017, is one of several digital payment firms Ant has stakes in Asia including India\u2019s Paytm and Thailand\u2019s TrueMoney.", "description": "SoftBank-backed ride hailer Grab is in talks to merge OVO, an Indonesian digital payments firm in which it owns shares, with an Ant Financial-backed local peer to build heft and power ahead of archrival Gojek, people familiar with the matter said.", "authors": ["Fanny Potkin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428573026&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A09A", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
