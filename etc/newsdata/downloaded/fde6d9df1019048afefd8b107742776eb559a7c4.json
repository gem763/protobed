Before leaving, they submitted applications for filming approval.\n\n\u201cOn arrival they arranged a meeting with authorities including the Executive Assistant of the President and a Senior Representative of the Immigration Department to discuss the application. Further forms were submitted and a request was made for expedited approval. That request was declined this morning and the 60 Minutes team were asked to remain in their hotel until the next flight out, which was their scheduled departure flight.\n\n\u201cThe crew is not under detention or house arrest as has been incorrectly reported, and the issue does not affect the story being worked on.\u201d\n\nThe Kiribati immigration official said that despite their infraction, the group had not received any penalty except the request not to leave the hotel until their departure.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no deportation, we don\u2019t lock them up in an immigration holding cell, they just relax at the hotel,\u201d he said.\n\nThe official confirmed that two immigration officials were stationed at the hotel to prevent the crew from leaving and said that earlier on Wednesday the crew had tried to leave the hotel and had been asked to return by the officials.\n\n\u201cThe way they conducted themselves is not entirely professional. They come here and lecture us on democracy, they come here and lecture us on how much we should charge people for the fee [for the media permit] and they come here because they think they can do whatever they want in the Pacific and beyond and we should follow suit. This is not acceptable. They insist on going out even though we ask them nicely to stay in the hotel, they ask for legal representation, they argue with officers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe official said the crew had had visitors and he suspected they were trying to make a documentary from inside the hotel.\n\n\u201cWe never experienced a media group like this, with these people undermining the authorities, talking back to them, teaching us our history and how to run this country and they have no verification and no rights to come here.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 another 60 Minutes crew, with the reporter Tara Brown, was detained in Beirut, Lebanon after filming a botched child recovery operation.\n\nBrown, the veteran producer Steven Rice, cameraman Ben Williamson and sound recordist David Ballment were arrested while attempting to help the Australian woman Sally Faulkner recover her children from her estranged husband.\n\nForeign journalists who come to Kiribati must receive permits from the government to report.\n\nThe Kiribati president, Taneti Maamau, restricted the criteria for media permits after a ferry sank off the country last year, killing 95 people, due to a litany of failings, including overcrowding on the boat. A team of New Zealand journalists from Newshub were detained last year upon arrival in the country to report on the ferry\u2019s sinking.\n\nThe Pacific Islands News Association, the leading regional news organisation, issued a statement saying it was \u201cconcerned\u201d by reports of the detention of the Australian crew and were carrying out an investigation through its own media partners on the ground in Kirbati.\n\n\u201cWe have tried to contact the 60 Minutes crew at their hotel in Tarawa but have been informed that they are not allowed incoming or outgoing calls, as per their detention order,\u201d said a spokesperson for PINA.", "description": "Australian Channel Nine crew held at a hotel with officials stationed outside their rooms after being denied a filming permit", "authors": ["Kate Lyons", "Amanda Meade"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f25eebab3483ab5a3c47aca316c13bf8272a37/0_271_4644_2786/master/4644.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b0eca95520e9bc2951a7129030f1b2b8", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
