I Said It.", "language": "en", "text": "That Wellness file of mine was a shallow excuse to write about a favorite performer who, in the last decade or so, appeared to lose her zest for performing. I, at least, had trouble making do with her alongside Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s Iron Man, playing Pepper Potts, his assistant then partner then wife then co-Avenger then widow. She was breezy with him but where was the beef? Between Marvel movies, I\u2019d take what I could get. That meant watching her, on the Goop site, slice pork with Jon Favreau, drink margaritas with Seamus Mullen; fry chicken with John Legend \u2014 well, he fried his; she baked hers. Was Paltrow hiding, taking a vacation, retiring, making absurdly savvy business decisions? She\u2019s got a good part, as a mansion-dwelling mommy with a secret life, on a new Netflix show called \u201cThe Politician.\u201d\n\nThe middle has gone out of the movies. And the middle was where Paltrow lived. Where else, besides streaming, would she even go now? Still, how could a person who seemed to act all the time, and at the height of her talent, gradually stop acting? Were there no roles that challenged her? She\u2019s 47 now : Were there just no roles?\n\nBut last week, I finished \u201cShe Said,\u201d a stressful new book by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey about, in part, how they broke the Weinstein sexual harassment story for The New York Times. In an epilogue there is a gathering of a dozen very different women (lawyers, a fast food worker, Christine Blasey Ford) at Paltrow\u2019s home where they talk about their experiences surviving and fighting back against a range of men . Among these women, she discloses the discovery that, even though she resisted him, Weinstein had been exploiting her success to prey upon women: How do you think Gwyneth has what she has?\n\n\u201cThat has by far been the hardest part of this,\u201d she tells the group, \u201cto feel like a tool in coercion of rape.\u201d\n\nWeinstein\u2019s effect on the many women he\u2019s alleged to have harassed, assaulted and worse remains largely private. For the actors, maybe he actively cost them work. Maybe what he did to them changed their relationship to their work. I\u2019ve spent two years wondering whether Paltrow\u2019s taste for acting had diminished because of that man, whether having his company seem synonymous with some of her strongest, most popular work compelled her to start a company of her own, one where the work concerned not acting but being, being whole, being better, being ridiculously better . How much power does a female actor truly have in Hollywood? Not just autonomous power, but the power to completely protect yourself from predation? Why not build something that doesn\u2019t control you because it\u2019s yours? Intelligence is an essential component of Paltrow\u2019s screen self. She rerouted that intelligence into the kind of workplace some people wish they had.", "description": "She\u2019s still among the very last generation of movie actors for whom stardom and skill seem scarily, thrillingly natural.", "authors": ["Wesley Morris"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/arts/30paltrow-tenenbaums/30paltrow-tenenbaums-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
