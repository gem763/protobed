The Enquirer never published her story.\n\n\u201cThe staffer opened the safe, removed a set of documents, and tried to wrest it shut,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cLater, reporters would discuss the safe like it was the warehouse where they stored the Ark of the Covenant in Indiana Jones, but it was small and cheap and old.\u201d\n\nThe safe, which often got jammed, had sat for years in an office that belonged to the Enquirer\u2019s then-longtime executive editor, Barry Levine.\n\nFarrow also quotes an Enquirer employee as saying that later that day a trash disposal crew collected \u201ca larger than customary volume of refuse.\u201d\n\nThat June, according to Farrow, Howard had put together a full list of Trump-related \u201cdirt\u201d that was in AMI\u2019s archives, some dating back decades. After Trump was elected, Trump fixer Michael Cohen asked for all of AMI\u2019s materials about Trump.\n\n\u201cThere was an internal debate: some were starting to realize that surrendering it all would create a legally problematic paper trail, and resisted,\u201d Farrow writes in \u201cCatch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators\u201d which will be published on Tuesday. \u201cNevertheless, Howard and senior staff ordered the reporting material that wasn\u2019t already in the small safe exhumed from storage bins in Florida and sent to AMI headquarters.\u201d\n\nWhen the material came to the AMI headquarters, it was first put into the small safe. Then, as the scandal around the magazine\u2019s close relationship with Trump deepened, it was placed into a bigger safe in the office of AMI\u2019s head of human resources, Daniel Rotstein.\n\n\u201cIt was only later, when one of the employees who had been skeptical started getting jumpy and went to check, that they found something amiss: the list of Trump dirt didn\u2019t match up with the physical files,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cSome of the material had gone missing.\u201d\n\nHoward told colleagues that none of the material was destroyed, but Farrow\u2019s sources expressed skepticism.\n\n\u201cWe are always at the edge of what\u2019s legally permissible,\u201d one senior AMI employee told Farrow. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\n\nAsked for comment, Howard attorney Paul Tweed said: \u201cWe have advised Mr. Howard to make no further comment at this stage, while all legal options and jurisdictions are being considered.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast reported in early October that the Tweed law firm sent threatening letters to a number of U.K. booksellers as well as Farrow\u2019s British publisher saying there were \u201cfalse and defamatory allegations\u201d in his book.\n\nAn American Media spokesperson said: \u201cMr. Farrow\u2019s narrative is driven by unsubstantiated allegations from questionable sources and while these stories may be dramatic, they are completely untrue.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Trump Organization didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Hatchette, which is publishing a book by Levine about Trump and women, declined to comment. Rotstein, who no longer works at AMI, could not be reached for comment.\n\nTrump had a decades-long close relationship with AMI CEO David Pecker and in turn, Pecker and the Enquirer protected Trump from his own misdeeds with a tabloid practice called \u201ccatch and kill\u201d in which the Enquirer bought up embarrassing stories involving Trump and then wouldn\u2019t publish them.\n\nFarrow quotes one former Enquirer journalist, Jerry George, who estimates that Pecker \u201ckilled perhaps ten fully reported stories about Trump, and nixed many more potential leads during George\u2019s twenty-eight years at the Enquirer.\u201d\n\nLate last year, AMI admitted its hush money payment to McDougal, which it said it had done to prevent her story from \u201cinfluencing the election.\u201d In an agreement with federal prosecutors that said AMI would not get charged for its role in the scheme, the company said it would cooperate with authorities.", "description": "American Media, Inc. and the National Enquirer shredded sensitive Donald Trump-related documents that had been held in a top-secret safe right before Trump was elected in 2016, according to fresh allegations made in a new book by journalist Ronan Farrow.
