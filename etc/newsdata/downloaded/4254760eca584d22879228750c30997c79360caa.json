Carlson and her mother, Cora Louise Adams, 85, of Elbe, Wa., were killed in December when they were hit by a bus while crossing Pennsylvania Avenue NW. (Family photo)\n\nThe driver of a tour bus who in December made an illegal left turn and struck two tourists in a downtown Washington crosswalk pleaded guilty Tuesday in a D.C. court to two counts of felony negligent homicide.\n\nGerard James, 45, could face a maximum of four years in prison as part of the plea deal, James\u2019s attorney Todd Baldwin said in D.C. Superior Court. Had James rejected the plea, gone to trial and been found guilty, he would have faced a maximum of 10 years in prison.\n\nThe Dec. 19 crash killed Monica Adams Carlson, 61, and her mother, Cora Louise Adams, 85, who were struck at around 9:40 p.m. as they crossed Pennsylvania Avenue near the National Archives and Navy Memorial.\n\n[Tour bus driver in fatal pedestrian crash was distracted by phone, D.C. police say]\n\nJames, who was a driver for Eyre Bus, Tour & Travel, was driving north on Seventh Street NW that night. When he got into the left turn lane at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue NW, James ignored a red-arrow that told drivers not to turn, Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward O\u2019Connell said in court. Instead, James steered onto Pennsylvania Avenue, where the two women, who had a pedestrian crossing signal, had just stepped off the sidewalk. Both women were hit and later died of blunt traumatic injuries.\n\n\u201cMr. James has a tremendous amount of remorse and sadness for the victims,\u201d Baldwin said. James, who stood next to his attorney, did not comment. He could speak in court on Nov. 15, when he is scheduled to be sentenced by D.C. Superior Court Judge Danya Dayson. James may remain out of jail at his Baltimore home until sentencing, Dayson ruled.\n\n\n\nCora Louise Adams, 85, of Elbe, Wash., left, with her grandson, Maxwell Carlson, who is a Marine stationed in Florida. Adams and her daughter, Monica Adams Carlson, 61, were killed in December when they were struck by a bus in the District. (Family photo)\n\nCarlson was the mayor of Skagway, Alaska; Adams, who lived in Elbe, Wash., ran a hamburger stand for tourists and hikers at Mount Rainier. The women had traveled to Washington to visit the White House and see Christmas decorations, which they did hours before they were struck.\n\nAuthorities said lighting was good at the intersection and the bus was in proper working order, with headlights on. The bus had no passengers at the time.\n\nJames told police he did not see Carlson and Adams, and stopped after he heard the impact, according to court documents. The bus at that point had traveled 183 feet from the intersection. Police said one of the women was caught under the bus and dragged. The arrest affidavit filed in D.C. Superior Court indicates that an attorney for the bus company turned over surveillance video from cameras inside the bus that showed the incident from two angles.\n\nIn court, O\u2019Connell said turning against the red arrow was not the only action by James that might have contributed to the crash. A camera on the tour bus showed James\u2019s cellphone ringing just before the turn. He answered the phone with his left hand, O\u2019Connell said, and then switched the phone to his right hand.\n\nBaldwin argued James\u2019s cellphone use was not the cause of the crash, but the illegal left turn was the source of James\u2019s negligence. Baldwin also said there were three streetlights at the corner where the victims were crossing that were not working at the time of the crash.\n\nWhen reached by telephone, Robert Carlson said he was \u201csurprised\u201d that four years was the maximum sentence in the deaths of his wife and mother-in-law.\n\n\u201cI would have thought that would have been the minimum,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I\u2019m torn right now. But I hope he has taken responsibility for his actions.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nPush to allow some violent criminals a chance at early release causes U.S. attorney for the District to come out fighting\n\nGrief for D.C. homicide victim is compounded by fatal shootout after his funeral\n\nFBI still has nothing to say about 2017 shooting of Bijan Ghaisar by Park Police\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Gerard James faces a maximum of four years in prison for the Dec. 19 crash that killed an Alaska city mayor and her mother.", "authors": ["Keith L.
