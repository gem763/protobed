It was a wild week in oil, with prices surging as much 19% on Monday, right after the attack, and tumbling about 6% the following session as traders tried to gauge the impact on global oil supply. Friday\u2019s gains were relatively modest as traders awaited the outcome of a high-level meeting by the Trump administration on the Saudi attack and how to deal with Iran.\n\nWashington suspects Iran as the perpetrator for the Sept 14 attack which initially disrupted 5.7 million barrels per day of Saudi production -- or 5% of world global output. Yemen-based Houthi rebels, however, have claimed responsibility for the attack and Tehran any role in it.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford would meet with President Donald Trump later Friday to present possible options for military retaliation.\n\nSo far, the U.S. has blamed Iran directly for the attacks, but Trump\u2019s only concrete reaction has been to impose further sanctions on the country, a move largely dismissed as symbolic given that existing U.S. sanctions on the country are already strangling its trade and capital flows.\n\nSaudi state oil company Aramco repeated its assurances Friday that it will have 11 million barrels a day of capacity back online by the end of the month, well above its current actual output level.\n\nMuch is riding on the kingdom's ability to recover from the initial attack and protect itself from future ones.\n\n\"A sustained oil price increase of $10 - $20 per barrel could cut global growth by 0.1\u20130.2 percentage point,\" said IHS Markit chief economist Nariman Behravesh in a research note.\n\n\"While the damage of an oil shock to the US economy will be much less than in the past, the harm to large net oil-importing economies such as China, Japan, and Europe could be significant.\"\n\nU.S. prices may also come under some pressure in the short term after heavy rainfall in the Houston area hit refinery activity. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) closed its 370,000 b/d Beaumont refinery on Thursday due to flooding. However, the floods have been nowhere near as severe as Hurricane Harvey two years ago, which knocked 4 million barrels a day of refining capacity offline.", "description": "Oil up nearly 7% on Week after Saudi Attack", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC9I0S2_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
