They\u2019ve got to the final without playing quite as well as they probably can, so I think they have a good chance of winning.\u201d\n\nLambie also offers his thoughts on England.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had two really big weekends, and the game against New Zealand was the best this England team has played together. But now they\u2019ll need another huge performance.\u201d\n\nThe 56-Test Bok also offers counsel for the build-up to the game.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep busy, try to stay relaxed, not get too worked up about the final. But Siya and the guys will know that - they\u2019ve played a lot of big games.\u201d\n\nLambie isn\u2019t the only one on the show anticipating a South African victory in Japan - rugby-mad author Deon Meyer is also calling a Springbok victory.\n\n\u201cI definitely think we\u2019re going to win it,\u201d predicts the acclaimed thriller writer, who famously named one of his villains Romaine Poite after the French referee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching a lot of the games, and I\u2019m feeling confident.\u201d\n\nMeyer also speaks proudly of the new M-Net series trackers, based on his bestselling novel of the same name.\n\n\u201cI was nervous before I saw the first episode, because M-Net hyped the series up a lot. But they\u2019ve done a terrific job, with the filming, the script, the actors. As the author, I\u2019m very happy.\u201d\n\nHaving recently sold his motorbike and changed his two-wheel hobby to mountain biking, Meyer also entertains the idea of setting a future novel around the Cape Epic.\n\nThere\u2019s also a Schalk on the show this week, but not Burger or Brits - comedian Schalk Bezuidenhout makes an appearance ahead of this weekend\u2019s Big 5 Comedy show in Cape Town, and just after his engagement, which he details with full comedy value.\n\nFellow comedian Joey Rasdien also makes an appearance, as he joins host Dan Nicholl for an archery challenge at Albie Morkel and Jo Black\u2019s Ultimate Aim in Pretoria, and Nedbank Golf Challenge tournament director Ken Payet confirms Ernie Els' appearance at the tournament, and gives an update on what\u2019s planned for local golf\u2019s biggest event.\n\nThe Dan Nicholl Show, presented by BrightRock, premieres every Wednesday night on SuperSport 8 at 19:00, and is available on ShowMax, Catch-up and DSTV Plus.\n\nWatch a preview of this week\u2019s show BELOW.", "description": "Recently retired Pat Lambie anticipates a good result for South Africa this weekend with the former star firmly believing the Springboks can win the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9537/fa8dd6e677624dcfa9e46efa81cd1eb6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
