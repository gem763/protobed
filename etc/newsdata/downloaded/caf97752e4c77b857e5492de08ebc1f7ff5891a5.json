(John Locher/AP)\n\nA county jail in Nevada may not be another planet, but it was alien territory for the pair of Dutch YouTube personalities who ended up in lockup after being arrested Tuesday on accusations of trespassing at the Nevada National Security Site outside Area 51 \u2014 the Air Force facility that\u2019s best known for conspiracies about UFOs and alien encounters.\n\nOne of the men said in a jailhouse interview with a Nevada TV station that a local woman who told them about \u201cStorm Area 51\u2033 \u2014 the alien desert festival turned viral Internet frenzy \u2014 stoked their interest in checking out the secure government site.\n\nTies Granzier, 20, and Govert Sweep, 21, were each charged with trespassing and held at the Nye County Detention Center, roughly 250 miles north of Las Vegas, according to the Nye County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n\n\nDutch nationals Govert Sweep, left, and Ties Granzier.

Sweep is also a video blogger and told 13 Action News he thinks his and Granzier\u2019s status as YouTube personalities is affecting their situation, suggesting the trespass would not have been a big deal otherwise. A Nye County sheriff\u2019s deputy confirmed the two were still being held as of Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cThey said we were going to go out of jail this morning, but we\u2019re still here and we don\u2019t know anything,\u201d he said Wednesday night.\n\n[Half a million people signed up to storm Area 51. What happens if they actually show?]\n\nOn Tuesday, deputies found Granzier and Sweep\u2019s rental car parked near a gate about three miles into the property, the department said in a statement. In their car, deputies found several cameras, a laptop and a drone. After confirming they understood and could speak English, the pair consented to deputies searching their cameras, in which the Nye County deputies saw video footage taken from the NNSS property, according to the department.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t realize this was going to happen,\u201d Sweep told 13 Action News in the jailhouse video interview Wednesday night.\n\nThe day of the arrest, Granzier posted a photo of himself at the Grand Canyon, teasing a visit to the site known as Area 51.\n\nIn the jailhouse interview, Sweep said he and Granzier were on their way from Tonopah, Nev., when they saw a sign for the Area 51 Alien Center, which Sweep observed as \u201ckind of a big deal here.\u201d That\u2019s where an employee told them about the Storm Area 51 event: an Internet sensation started by a college student as a joke that eventually swelled to some 2 million interested attendees. The day Granzier and Ties were arrested, Storm Area 51\u2019s creators pulled out over fears that the mass of visitors would overwhelm the small rural Nevada town and potentially create a \u201chumanitarian disaster.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Storm Area 51\u2019 creator pulls out of his own event, calling it Fyre Festival 2.0]\n\nSweep said in the interview that a woman at the alien center told them they could go into Mercury, Nev., where they could get a closer look. When they arrived, Sweep said, they weren\u2019t alone and \u201cthere were a lot of cars going there.\u201d\n\nDespite seeing a sign barring entry, Sweep said he interpreted the warning as applying to nonresidents, and thought they could ask a live person if they might enter anyway. Though both of the men read, write and speak English, Sweep chalked up their alleged trespass to a simple misunderstanding.\n\n\u201cThere were no bad intentions. We saw the military post and then had to turn back at that point. We thought we could ask someone,\u201d he told 13 Action News.\n\nA Nye County sheriff\u2019s deputy told The Washington Post on Thursday that trespassers to the NNSS site are rare, with the exception of an occasional stray protester.\n\nThe NNSS website describes the Mercury location as a \u201cpremier outdoor, indoor, and underground national laboratory\u201d located in a \u201cremote, highly secure area of southern Nevada.\u201d While scheduled tours are open to the public, foreign nationals are required to submit advance paperwork to visit \u2014 and all visitors are barred from bringing recording devices such as cameras, cellphones and laptops.\n\nRead more:\n\nWatched by millions, \u2018vape influencers\u2019 worry they will become collateral damage in Trump\u2019s new ban\n\nThe government admits it studies UFOs.
