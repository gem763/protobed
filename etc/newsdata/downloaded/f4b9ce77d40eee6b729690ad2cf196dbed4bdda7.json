For now, Tyrrell Pigrome will work with the first-team offense in practice. Locksley said he expects Pigrome to start Saturday\u2019s game at Purdue, but wouldn\u2019t rule out Jackson.\n\nJackson played well in the season\u2019s first two games, but Pigrome split practice reps with him heading into the matchup at Rutgers. Jackson\u2019s poor performances in losses to Temple and Penn State urged the staff to be ready to make a midgame switch if needed. That preparation proved useful, even though the change came under different circumstances.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the worst way to get the job,\u201d Pigrome said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I look at it as motivation, and I\u2019m trying to push myself forward.\u201d\n\nWith Pigrome under center, the game plan will remain essentially the same. While still leaning on each quarterback\u2019s strengths, the staff has a \u201csimilar menu of plays that we call for both,\u201d Locksley said. Pigrome\u2019s elusiveness will help prevent sacks and give the offense a different dimension. But the redshirt junior will also be working behind an offensive line that was missing three starters against Rutgers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around here for a lot of injuries when we\u2019ve had to play with a linebacker at quarterback for several games,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cYou get creative. Our coaching staff does a good job of knowing what we can do well and identifying that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPigrome has played in numerous games and started a handful of others but never for a sustained stretch. As a freshman, he stepped in for the injured starter, Perry Hills, in double overtime at Central Florida and scored the winning touchdown on a 24-yard run on his first play. But when Pigrome started later in the year against Minnesota, he struggled, throwing for 161 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nPigrome earned the starting spot to open the following season against Texas, but he tore his ACL in the second half and missed the rest of the year. In 2018, Pigrome started the season as the backup to Kasim Hill but took over after Hill tore his ACL in the 10th game. Pigrome nearly led a comeback victory in that game against Indiana, as well as against Ohio State, but he missed his receiver on a two-point conversion attempt in overtime against the Buckeyes.\n\nPigrome has showed potential in bursts \u2014 hitting receivers deep, flashing his speed when scrambling and leading the offense with poise. He has just never gotten the chance to start for more than two consecutive games.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMan, we feel confident with Piggy,\u201d running back Javon Leake said after the win over Rutgers.\n\nDepending on Jackson\u2019s recovery timeline, this could be Pigrome\u2019s longest stretch as the starter. And it could quickly become his most meaningful time in charge of the offense. Maryland\u2019s hopes to become bowl eligible will take center stage this month with Purdue, Indiana and Minnesota on the schedule before the Terps turn toward their difficult November slate.\n\nWhen Jackson earned the starting job in the preseason, Pigrome said, \u201cthe first two days, it was definitely hard; I\u2019m not going to lie to you.\u201d Since Locksley\u2019s arrival, Pigrome has improved as a passer, one of the areas in which the new staff hoped to see growth. Even though Jackson, a graduate transfer from Virginia Tech, won the job, the quarterback competition was closer than Locksley expected, an encouraging sign for how Maryland might fare for as long as it needs to be led by its backup.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany quarterbacks have opted to transfer when playing time doesn\u2019t come their way. Pigrome entered his name in the transfer portal at the end of last season, before the new coach had been named. Soon after, he removed his name because he was excited to play for Locksley within the offense he ran at Alabama. That didn\u2019t change when the new staff began pursuing help at quarterback through graduate transfers and ultimately brought in Jackson.\n\n\u201cThere are some good people here,\u201d Pigrome said when asked why he decided to stay. \u201cI heard people talking about Coach Locks, how he\u2019s a good person. I\u2019m like, \u2018All right, I have a good relationship with these teammates, so I trust their word.\u2019 \u2026 I believed in him, and I trusted him.\u201d\n\nFor Pigrome, the game at Purdue will begin his chance to show how far he has come. He hasn\u2019t felt fully healthy since that Texas opener in 2017. Now he\u2019s back and even more comfortable without a knee brace.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe has had promising moments. Now Pigrome should have a considerable stretch, even if its length remains unknown, to lead his Maryland teammates and see how far he can take them.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve always tried to do is prepare him mentally that you have to be ready when your opportunity comes. And you never know when that is,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cNow with Josh\u2019s injury, he\u2019ll have an opportunity to go play and hopefully take advantage of the opportunity that he\u2019ll have.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The redshirt junior has started every season he has played at Maryland but never more than two games in a row.
