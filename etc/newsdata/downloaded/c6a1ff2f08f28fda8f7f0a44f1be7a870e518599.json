This would involve the three parties standing down for each other and, in some places, not standing against strongly remain Labour candidates.\n\nSources said a formal announcement was expected in the coming days, probably next week. One party source said there had been a meeting several weeks ago, but none more recently. \u201cI imagine a general election will concentrate people\u2019s minds and the process will now move fairly quickly,\u201d they said.\n\nOne complication is that decisions have to be agreed by local activists. The three parties involved are notably decentralised, with constituency parties having considerable autonomy. The source said: \u201cThe hope is that with such an uncertain election, and the tight timetable, we can get people to agree more willingly.\u201d\n\nThe 2017 plan ran into problems, mainly because of a perceived unwillingness of parties to give ground, especially Labour. The Greens subsequently expressed scepticism about taking part in a similar process again.\n\nBut a Green spokeswoman said the party was committed to the process now: \u201cIt is right that political parties engage in grown-up discussions about how to best stop a deeply damaging Brexit. Our party is in talks about the potential to stand a single remain-supporting candidate in some seats in England and Wales, as was successfully done in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. No decisions have yet been made and any agreement will involve the relevant local parties.\u201d", "description": "Parties may stand aside in some constituencies in bid to stop \u2018damaging Brexit\u2019", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f2368aa46c27ba3925b18d84b8106e7e46c12d0/0_197_3230_1938/master/3230.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7947e62cbd36ffe7df61bbdecfc5401d", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
