From the seeds, they have harvested the groundnuts and squash leaves shown on the table.\n\n\"A table in Natalie's home, with a machete, radio, chicken-foot talisman, box of matches, hanging squash leaves and groundnuts in a bag,\" says De Bode, \"the radio is one of their prized possessions. They are an important part of rural life for communities with no access to TV or internet - but they are only able to use them intermittently when they are able to buy batteries.\"\n\nImage copyright Chris de Bode/Panos Pictures\n\nDe Bode says of his picture of the table of the nutritional health officer at Gbandengue clinic: \"On the table is a health register and notebook, stethoscope, CAR flag, official stamp with ink and pens and a photograph of Selefio Stanislas, the previous director of the facility, who died recently.\"\n\nImage copyright Chris de Bode/Panos Pictures\n\n\"A metal bowl on a table in Nadine's house with palm nuts, mushrooms, mashed cassava and avocados. All the items were bought from the local market that day to make a family meal.\n\n\"Nadine is a Mama Lumi\u00e8re in her community, which means she passes on her skills and knowledge to other women and encourages mothers to take their children to the nearby health facility at the first sign of malnutrition or sickness.\"\n\nLiberia, by Nora Lorek\n\nImage copyright Nora Lorek/ Panos Pictures\n\nMum-of-five Handful Bowein, 30, and her son Israel, two.\n\n\"When Israel was 18 months old, he weighed just 4.4kg [9lb 11oz] and was unable to walk because he was severely malnourished,\" Lorek says.\n\n\"An infection that had developed after the birth of her first child meant Handful was unable to breastfeed any of her children.\"\n\nImage copyright Nora Lorek/Concern/Panos Pictures\n\nMary Wrobone, 46, is a member of a savings and loan association and mothers' group.\n\n\"Thanks to the training she has received in the mothers' group, she is able to demonstrate how to cook a meal for a sick or malnourished child,\" Lorek says.\n\n\"These cookery demonstrations show mothers how to prepare nutritious meals and diversify diets with vegetables and locally available fruit, like papaya, banana and pineapple.\"\n\nImage copyright Nora Lorek/ Panos Pictures\n\nSeven-month pregnant mum-of-five Patience Darway, 35, told Lorek: ''I have learned new things with my friends this year. The most important is how to breastfeed my newborn properly and to include vegetables in the family diet.\n\n\"My vegetable garden is really useful. I used to have to buy [vegetables]. Now I just take from the garden. It means I can spend money on other needs.\"\n\nImage copyright Nora Lorek/ Panos Pictures\n\n\"Orphelia[, eight,] is in her first year in primary school. Jimmy[, 25,] is a member of Wrobone Town mothers' group and savings and loan association.\n\n\"When Jimmy's father fell ill last year, she made use of the community savings and loan association, borrowing money to hire labourers to cultivate her family's land.\n\n\"She was also able to start up a small business selling frozen food and even begin work on a new house.\"\n\nFree From Hunger is at More London Riverside Development until 31 October.", "description": "A new exhibition highlights malnutrition in the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Liberia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15166/production/_109147368_southsudan146.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
