This builds on rumors from September suggesting Fitbit was in conversation with investment banking firm Qatalyst Partners as it entertained the possibility of a sale, and Google was suspected to be a potential buyer at the time. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nHere's why a Google buyout could make a strong market exit for Fitbit:\n\nFitbit has struggled to unseat Apple Watch as the market leader for wearables. Fitbit enjoyed relative success recently, growing revenue after nearly three years in decline. And we have attributed this success in no small part to the company's renewed focus on healthcare.\n\nHowever, the wearable maker is still losing out to the Apple Watch, which claimed just over half the market for global smart watch shipments in 2018, according to Strategy Analytics. And Fitbit's latest attempt to win over users with a cheaper line of devices, the Inspire HR and Versa Lite, failed to gain traction, causing the company to lower its guidance for the year during its July earnings release.\n\nFor its part, Fitbit brings a bounty of healthcare partnerships from which Alphabet can build out its own wearable line focused on healthcare. Fitbit has been incredibly successful when it comes to securing major healthcare partnerships for research and remote patient monitoring.\n\nIn the past few months, Fitbit has inked deals with the Singapore government to provide health trackers for hundreds of thousands of people and with a major pharma alliance comprised of Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb to develop educational content and health suggestions for Fitbit users who may be at risk of atrial fibrillation. And we've posited that large-scale healthcare organizations might be seeking out partnerships with Fitbit because its devices possess many health features similar to those on the Apple Watch, but without the bloat (and added cost) of more consumer-oriented features, like texting and navigation apps.\n\nAnd acquiring Fitbit could boost the reach of Alphabet subsidiaries Verily and Google Health with consumers, as well as bring in heaps of data for health research. Google is making strides with Google Cloud for enterprise health firms, empowering providers with AI data analytics, and even branching out into behavioral health care with a Verily-backed opioid rehabilitation clinic.\n\nBut Alphabet's lack of a wearable platform is a noticeable gap in its broad healthcare play when compared with rival Apple: Leveraging the Apple Watch's huge consumer footprint, Apple has demonstrated its ability to improve clinical study recruitment and is positioning its wearable line to be an invaluable platform for research across a variety of health conditions. If Google manages to close a deal with Fitbit, it could expand the company's reach with consumers and, perhaps more importantly, provide troves of patient health data to fuel research at Alphabet subsidiaries.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
