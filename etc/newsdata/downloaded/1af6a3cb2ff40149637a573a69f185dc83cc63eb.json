It just took a few more swings than he expected because it didn\u2019t break on the first attempt as he had figured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a regular TV where it shatters, it just went thud,\u201d Bochy recalled this week.\n\nSuch moments of madness were rare for Bochy, who is known more for his even-keel temperament, and that made them all the more meaningful. While his legacy in San Francisco will always be capturing those three World Series titles in a remarkable five-year span, Bochy\u2019s reputation for fairness and having a genuine way of dealing with players has been of utmost importance to him during a decorated 25-year managerial career.\n\n\u201cMy hope is they know I care. I don\u2019t always get it right as far as communicating,\u201d said Bochy, who wraps up what has certainly been a Hall of Fame career this weekend. \u201cI know there have been players who questioned how fair I was, too, and that\u2019s going to happen in this job. If most of the guys feel that way (he was fair), it makes me feel good. I appreciate that. That means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nBochy has spent the last 13 seasons with the Giants following 12 in San Diego, where he guided a Padres club led by Hall of Famers Tony Gwynn and Trevor Hoffman to the 1998 World Series. San Diego got swept by the Yankees. He never got fired along the way, joking he beat the Padres to it when he departed for their NL West rival up north.\n\nA former first-round pick catcher who played nine major league seasons with Houston, the New York Mets and Padres, he opted to announce his retirement plans early in spring training to avoid any distractions for his club considering he faced regular questions about his future. He manages his last game Sunday.\n\nBochy arrived in the Bay Area just ahead of home run king Barry Bonds\u2019 final season of 2007. He managed Bonds through his successful pursuit of Hank Aaron\u2019s all-time home run record, choosing when to rest the seven-time NL MVP and when to push him amid the daily pressures of chasing the record.\n\nAnother Barry, Barry Zito, will never forget Bochy\u2019s respectful approach in telling the left-hander - earning a team-high $18.5 million at the time - that he wouldn\u2019t make the playoff roster in 2010, when the Giants went on to capture their first World Series title since moving West in 1958. They made it an every-other-year thing after that, winning titles again in the even years of 2012 and \u201814.\n\n\u201cSuch a professional. Boch is so composed. It\u2019s almost like it doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore when guys are yelling, but with Bochy he\u2019s always so composed so when he did get mad or raise his voice - or, take a baseball bat through a flat-screen TV - then you\u2019d listen,\u201d Zito said. \u201cHe did that once. It was probably \u201808. He had to have very difficult discussions with me about leaving me off the roster in 2010. He was always just so amazing at handling his players.\n\n\u201cHe always treated me with respect even though a lot of times I didn\u2019t deserve respect in the game at those times.\u201d\n\nBochy, to this day, respects how Zito immediately got back to work despite the disappointing news. The 2002 AL Cy Young Award winner with Oakland, Zito came back from that to help the Giants win the 2012 title.\n\nOthers have noticed from afar how Bochy handles the tough matters.\n\n\u201cWe have shared and exchanged ideas and thoughts over the years from a managerial basis,\u201d said Pirates manager Clint Hurdle, who played against Bochy and also managed regularly against him while with Colorado. \u201cWatching from afar, the number of quality, elite players that have gone through here, they all speak glowingly of him on their way out. I don\u2019t know if anybody bats 1.000. He bats close to 1.000. I also think he\u2019s remained true to himself in his core beliefs. He\u2019s a good baseball man and I think he has over time learned how to adapt, to improvise and overcome. I have nothing but the utmost professional and personal respect for him. It\u2019s a Hall of Fame career. It\u2019s a Hall of Fame manager. San Francisco and San Diego I think will both look back, they\u2019re feeling it now, at what a wonderful opportunity they had to share the career with him.\u201d\n\nRepeatedly, Bochy has trusted his gut based on a player\u2019s track record over time rather than looking at one bad day or slump.\n\n\u201cIn his 25 years as a big league manager, Boch never had a team that underperformed. He never was given a team that was supposed to win a division, win a pennant, or win a World Series, but he always got the most out of his teams, his players, his coaches. He trusted the length of the season to allow players to be the best they could be by giving them every chance, every opportunity, while believing in them and putting them in the roles they needed to be in, and in what he needed from them to win as a team,\u201d recalled Tim Flannery, Bochy\u2019s ex-teammate and longtime third base coach in both cities.\n\nBochy understands what it takes to be a role player in the game, too. He was a career .239 hitter with 26 homers and 93 RBIs.\n\n\u201cSometimes the tough moments are some of the most cherished memories, because people do things in tough times and that experience \u2026 being in the trenches and supporting each other, you grow very firm bonds and very strong bonds,\u201d said Texas outfielder Hunter Pence, who lost his starting job with the Giants in 2018. \u201cYou just appreciate all the work and all the effort, just his whole character. Playing for him and being around him, he lights up the room, he\u2019s funny, he\u2019s fun, he\u2019s smart and he gives you every opportunity to succeed. And I\u2019m thankful for all of these things, not just one.\u201d\n\nSimilar to the Zito situation, Bochy said one of his toughest conversations ever came in early August with Joe Panik, to let the second baseman know he was being designated for assignment. It never gets any easier to let a player go.\n\n\u201cYou may think it does but it\u2019s part of the job,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cThis was one of the more difficult ones. I really like Joe, I respect him, of course appreciate everything he\u2019s done here. I\u2019m not going to lie, this was a very tough one, but it should be. You spend as much time as we all do together and for as long as we\u2019ve been together, it\u2019s going to be tough. If it\u2019s not, you\u2019re not human.\u201d\n\nBochy\u2019s approach has remained fairly simple: \u201cI try to treat people the way I would want to be treated. I kind of have to remind myself of that. It\u2019s not an easy game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bruce Bochy once took a bat to a flat-screen TV during a San Francisco Giants team meeting to make a point to his players.
