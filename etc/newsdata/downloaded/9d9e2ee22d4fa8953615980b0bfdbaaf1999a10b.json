Barr and Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, as individuals the committee wanted to speak with. But he declined to say if he would subpoena either of them.\n\nPresident Trump offered the assistance of both Mr. Barr and Mr. Giuliani to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the event he were to open an investigation into the son of Democratic Presidential frontrunner Joseph R. Biden, according to a transcript of the July 25 phone call.\n\nMr. Barr has insisted he did not know his name was floated in the conversation until weeks later.\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Schiff said his committee would like to talk to the attorney general.\n\n\u201cWe want to know what role Rudy Giuliani had in all of this. We what to know what role Bill Barr had in any of this. We want to know what Ukraine understood was expected of them before they even had this July 25 phone call with the president,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.\n\nWhen asked what he hoped to uncover, Mr. Schiff said there are a number of potential violations that could be revealed.\n\n\u201cI think there are any number of potential crimes when a president is soliciting for an assistance again in another presidential election,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Mr. Schiff was speaking, Mr. Trump fired off a tweet attacking one of his most fiercest critics.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
