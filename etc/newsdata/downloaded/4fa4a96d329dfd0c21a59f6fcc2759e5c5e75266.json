REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s third-largest economy bucked a global cooling trend and grew faster than expected in the first half of 2019, but analysts say the U.S.-China trade dispute and expanding protectionist policies around the world will eventually drag on the export-reliant country.\n\nNevertheless, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad\u2019s government forecast economic growth of 4.8% next year, slightly higher than this year\u2019s projected 4.7%, and pencilled in a very modest improvement in exports. (For budget highlights, click)\n\nAnalysts said the growth projection for next year was optimistic, with economic research consultancy Capital Economics forecasting only 4%.\n\n\u201cIn the event of continued worse-than-expected external environment, the government stands ready to step in with contingency measures to provide further support or stimulus to growth,\u201d Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said in a two-and-half-hour budget speech in parliament.\n\nAs expected, the government projected a fiscal deficit of 3.2% of gross domestic product (GDP), larger than an initial target of 3% but lower than this year\u2019s 3.4%, citing a heightened risk of a global economic slowdown and unanticipated spending needed to rescue troubled state institutions.\n\nThe government expects the fiscal deficit to average 2.8%over the medium term.\n\nLim had said earlier it would be a \u201cchallenge\u201d to meet the earlier deficit target for 2020.\n\n\u201cSet against a projected contraction in revenues, the expanded budget puts the government\u2019s original 3.0% deficit target for 2020 further out of reach,\u201d said Anushka Shah, senior analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\n\n\u201cFiscal strength will continue to constrain Malaysia\u2019s credit profile, although the focus on some inclusive growth measures will be credit positive for the country if sustained over time.\u201d\n\nMalaysia\u2019s stock market ended higher on Friday as Lim delivered his speech.\n\nINCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT\n\nMalaysia will also provide tax exemptions to promote high value-added activities in its massive electrical and electronics industry, as it looks to attract companies moving operations from China because of the escalating Sino-U.S. tariff battle.\n\nNew incentives for foreign investment will be finalised by Jan. 1. The government will also extend up to 1 billion worth of customized incentives annually over five years, as part of push to attract top global companies.\n\nThe government budgeted 297.02 billion ringgit ($70.85 billion) in spending for 2020, 6% lower than this year.\n\nAnalysts had expected an expanded budget overall, but the government is grappling with a 1 trillion ringgit debt pile left behind by its predecessors and with declining revenue.\n\nRevenue is forecast at 244.53 billion ringgit in 2020, down 7.1% from this year\u2019s projection. Unlike this year, there will be no repeat of a 30 billion ringgit one-off payout to the government by state energy firm Petronas [PETR.UL].\n\nHowever, Lim ruled out reintroducing a goods and services tax (GST) that was repealed last year.\n\nThe government\u2019s operating budget will drop sharply to 241.02 billion ringgit next year from 262.26 billion ringgit allocated for this year. But development spending will expand to 56 billion ringgit from 53.7 billion ringgit in 2019.\n\nIn an accompanying fiscal outlook report, the government said it would also set aside an additional 3 billion ringgit to speed up ongoing major infrastructure projects.\n\nMODEST GROWTH OUTLOOK\n\nThe government said the economy is expected to grow in the range of 4.5% to 5.0% over 2020-2022.\n\nDomestic demand is expected to rise 4% this year and 4.8% next year, supported by a stable labor market and low prices.\n\nThe government expects private sector activity to continue to prop up the economy. The services sector, which accounts for about 58% of GDP, is forecast to grow 6.1% in 2019 and 6.2% next year.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nPolicymakers expect petroleum-related revenue to fall 1.4% to 50.5 billion ringgit in 2020, based on a global crude oil price of $62 per barrel.\n\nGross exports are estimated to expand by 0.1% in 2019 and 1.0% the following year.\n\nThe current account surplus is likely to widen to 43.4 billion ringgit in 2019 on an increase in net exports of goods and services. However, projected weakness in global and domestic demand and commodity prices is expected to slash that figure to 29 billion ringgit in 2020.", "description": "Malaysia's government on Friday unveiled a smaller budget than expected for next year but flagged a wider budget deficit than earlier estimated, and said it would step in with stimulus measures should global demand worsen.", "authors": ["Joseph Sipalan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439606315&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0LI", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
