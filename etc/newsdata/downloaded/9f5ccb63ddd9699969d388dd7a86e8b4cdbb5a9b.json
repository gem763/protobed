Many thought Morticia was her 18-year-old daughter, Lola Consuelos.\n\nWhen Kelly Ripa reposted a Halloween photo from the Live with Kelly and Ryan Instagram account, she didn't expect fans to react the way they did.\n\nThe picture in question features Kelly dressed up as Wednesday and Morticia and her co-star Ryan Seacrest as Pugsley from The Addams Family. To complete the creepy and kooky ensemble, Kelly's husband, Mark Consuelos, put on a Gomez costume, producer Michael Gelman played Lurch, and executive in charge Art Moore donned an Uncle Fester get-up. As Kelly teased in her Instagram caption, these costumes will be shown on Live with Kelly and Ryan's annual Halloween special this Thursday.\n\nUpon seeing the fun picture, many fans complimented Ryan and Kelly's Addams Family outfits. Besides that though, quite a few seemed really confused.\n\nPhoto credit: Instagram More\n\nBecause Kelly was also dressed as Wednesday, a handful of commenters assumed Morticia had to be Lola Consuelos, her 18-year-old daughter. Kelly, shocked that folks didn't recognize her, took time to clarify to her followers that she was actually both characters. \"What is going on? They're both me \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\" she wrote to one confused fan. In reply to another, she simply replied with an eye-rolling emoji.\n\nPhoto credit: Instagram More\n\nPhoto credit: Instagram More", "description": "Kelly's reaction is everything.", "authors": ["Kayla Keegan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ril0R1qX7ZXUJ6h4PVDHoQ--~B/aD0yNTI7dz01MDM7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_prevention_66/603172c1b0728ee4d9261729d98d1050", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
