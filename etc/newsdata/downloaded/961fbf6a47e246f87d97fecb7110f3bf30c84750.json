I\u2019m trying to point out there is a major discrepancy between what the mission statement as I understood it was and what they\u2019re now saying.\u201d\n\nCamerota acknowledged she was still \u201cvery close to some people at Fox\u201d and didn\u2019t really like talking \u201cabout how they run their operation, but the times that I talk about it, it\u2019s when the hypocrisy is so astonishing that I can\u2019t help but to talk about it.\u201d\n\nDesiree Navarro via Getty Images Alisyn Camerota joined CNN from Fox News in 2014.\n\n\u201cI remember what the talking points were there, what the mandate was there, I remember the issues that we went crazy with,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat drove our news cycle for days, weeks. Now, I can\u2019t believe that they\u2019ve forgotten that. There are times where I just can\u2019t believe the reversal on the air that they have done. ... \u201c\n\n\u201cThey went berserk when Barack Obama would use executive action. Now, they don\u2019t care,\u201d Camerota added. \u201cThe idea of sitting down with dictators, the idea that Barack Obama said he might consider that \u2014 they went crazy, went berserk with that. So, all I\u2019m looking for is a little like position consistency. ... Their 180-degree turn has been astonishing for me.\u201d\n\nCamerota, who now hosts CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d last year explained how key talking points from her old show on Fox were regurgitated by social media bot accounts (operated by Russian officials) in a bid to sow discord in America.", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to insult them,\" said CNN's Alisyn Camerota.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8496fa2300003100cf6ac3.jpeg?cache=s8c1otblqe&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
