From today until Monday, October 28, the outdoorsy retailer is hosting its Snow Big Deal Event, which has some of the biggest winter gear discounts of the year.\n\nRight now, you can get up to 50% off select jackets, snow pants, and boots, 25% off all Swix and North waxing and tuning products, and 20% off one class, day tour, or event hosted by REI with the coupon code SNOW4DAYS19. Skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports can get quite pricey, so this is a great chance to score some essentials for a discount. Those planning to hit the slopes this winter can also save on lift passes at a few select mountains, which is perfect if you already had a ski trip in the works.\n\nBut this sale isn't just limited to those interested in winter sports. There are a ton of discounts on coats and boots you'll want to wear in your day-to-day all season long. The Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket dropped down to $138.93 ($60 in savings), and The North Face Descendit Insulated Jacket is half off, bringing the price to $135. Plus, you'll want to live in these Sorel Whitney Camp Boots, which are currently 45% off.\n\nWarning: Stock is especially limited on the clothing and footwear, so if you see something you like (and in your size),we recommend you act sooner than later. But whether you're a snow bunny or are dreading the brutal cold, there's something in this sale for you.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
