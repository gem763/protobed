The contest would also only take place if at least 2,500 people attended the game.\n\nHowever, Joyce Tremblay, spokesperson for the R\u00e9gie des alcools, des courses et des jeux (RACJ), told Radio-Canada Friday it was that element \u2014 tying the existence of the draw to attendance figures \u2014 which was \"simply illegal.\"\n\n\"The team does not have the right to ask fans to pay two dollars without knowing if the draw will take place or not,\" Tremblay said in a French-language interview.\n\nThe club also didn't apply for a licence, and even if they had, the application might have been denied on the grounds it was a cross between a contest and a draw \u2014 making it difficult for the RACJ to determine what kind of licence to grant, , Tremblay said.\n\nGatineau Olympiques players practice at the Robert-Guertin Centre. (Jonathan Jobin/Radio-Canada)\n\n'We need to be more cautious'\n\nThe junior hockey club announced Saturday it would be temporarily suspending the promotion.\n\n\"In the past we have done various promotions on the internet, and we didn't think this would be any different. Now, we know we need to be more cautious,\" team president Martin Lacasse told Radio-Canada in French.\n\nHolding a lottery without the necessary licence contravenes the Canadian Criminal Code.\n\nIf the club had decided to go ahead with the promotion for its Sunday game against the Drummondville Voltigeurs, it could have left them open to charges, according to the Gatineau Police Service.\n\nLacasse said he hoped the suspension of the promotion wouldn't keep the Olympiques from drawing a decent crowd Sunday.\n\nThe Olympiques play regularly in front of crowds of less than 2,000, and only topped 2,500 fans seven times during the 2018-19 QMJHL season.", "description": "The Gatineau Olympiques\u00a0are pulling the plug on a promotion that could have ended with one lucky fan taking home thousands of\u00a0dollars after the province's liquor and gaming authority said it wasn't legal.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5319574.1570913304!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/qmjhl-promotion-gatineau-olympiques-illegal.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
