For some reason, players have access to not one, not two, not four, but five different tattoos featuring a Bald eagle and American imagery.\n\nThe new Ghost Recon game launched earlier this week. I jumped into the game and messed around with it for a few hours. It seems fine. If you want more in-depth impressions, read Heather\u2019s great write-up of the game. But I\u2019m here instead to rank each of these eagle tattoos.\n\nI will ask two important questions about each eagle design, which will determine their rating and ranking: How big is the eagle? And how cool looking is the eagle?\n\nSimple enough. So let\u2019s get to ranking!\n\n5 - Soaring Eagle\n\nSize: 3/5 | Coolness: 3/5\n\nAt the bottom of the list is The Soaring Eagle. It\u2019s hard to even tell that it is, in fact, a Bald eagle. I mean, that could be a vulture from far away. The pose is also not very exciting. In a game filled with eagle tattoos, this is the runt. The one nobody wants or buys.\n\n4 - The American Eagle\n\nSize: 5/5 | Coolness: 2/5\n\nIf this was a list where I ranked each tattoo according to their name, this would be at the bottom of the pile. That isn\u2019t a clever name or anything. It just is what it is. However, the size is very good. That is a large eagle and it is clearly a Bald eagle. But that pose is terrible. It looks like the eagle just heard a joke and is way overselling how funny the joke is because his boss said it.\n\n3 - The Bold Eagle\n\nSize: 5/5 | Coolness: 3/5\n\nThat is a big and, dare I say, bold, eagle. A great name for a fairly good eagle tattoo. The pose isn\u2019t very interesting, but at least it doesn\u2019t look too weird. He is staring a bit too intently for my liking, though. If I was in a squad with this dude and he had this tattoo I would ask him to wear long-sleeve shirts, so I wouldn\u2019t constantly feel intimated by that bird.\n\n2 - The Freedom Eagle\n\nSize: 4/5 | Coolness: 5/5\n\nThis may not be the biggest eagle, but that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s big enough and has a really exciting pose. Look at it! It is diving and attacking something. Maybe a snake? Hopefully a snake. Those things will sneak into your house.\n\n1 - Swooping Eagle\n\nSize: 5/5 | Coolness: 4/5\n\nThis is the biggest eagle on the list. Honestly, it might be one of the biggest eagle tattoos featured in a video game. I haven\u2019t done enough research on that, so I could be wrong. But I feel confident in saying that there can\u2019t be much bigger than this swooping eagle.\n\nThis ended up tying with the Freedom Eagle, both receiving 9 eagle points out of a possible 10. So I decided to use the number of stars as the tiebreaker. This was no contest. Swooping Eagle has six stars and the poor Freedom Eagle has none. What a shame.\n\nAre these tattoos worth actual money? I don\u2019t think so, but I\u2019m more into pelicans anyways, so what do I know? I hope the next Ghost Recon game has a bunch of pelican tattoos.", "description": "I\u2019m here to talk about something odd I discovered in the recently released Ghost Recon Breakpoint.
