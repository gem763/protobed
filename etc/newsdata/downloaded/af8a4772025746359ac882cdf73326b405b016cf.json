He said he pledged to bring troops home and that the media will criticize him no matter what he does.\n\nHoping to keep evangelicals \u2014 who backed him by a 4-1 margin over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton \u2014 in his corner, the president cast himself as a bulwark against a mainstream intent on liberal change.\n\n\u201cYou are the warriors on the frontiers defending American freedom. We meet tonight at a crucial moment in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d he told the Values Voter Summit in Washington, which was hosted by the legislative arm of the Family Research Council. \u201cOur shared values are under assault like never before. Extreme left-wing radicals, both inside and outside government, are determined to shred our Constitution and eradicate the beliefs we all cherish.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said he won\u2019t let the IRS infringe on houses of worship or allow Congress to expand abortion rights. He touted his Israel policy and pointed to the huge slate of conservative judges he has put on the bench, likely reshaping the courts for decades to come.\n\nThere is a straight line, Mr. Trump said, between Democrats\u2019 attacks on Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and what he is facing now. He said Democrats are using his interactions with Ukraine to undo the 2016 election and \u201cstop our movement and impose their agenda by any means necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she hates our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t hate our country, she wouldn\u2019t be doing this to our country. It\u2019s a fraud.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say Mr. Trump left them no choice but to gather documents and testimony after Mr. Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his assistance in investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a political rival, and his son Hunter Biden, who had business ties in Ukraine. The president said his call with Mr. Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d and that he can\u2019t believe his rivals are pursuing impeachment.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see or hear that word with regard to me. It\u2019s an ugly word,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt means horrible, horrible crimes and things. I can\u2019t even believe it.\u201d\n\nThe House\u2019s impeachment inquiry hasn\u2019t eroded Mr. Trump\u2019s support among evangelicals because \u201cthey see that as political theater,\u201d Family Research Council President Tony Perkins told The Washington Times ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s speech.\n\nWhat is happening in Syria, however, \u201chas shaken some people,\u201d he said.\n\nTelevangelist Pat Robertson has said Mr. Trump risks losing the \u201cmandate of heaven\u201d by withdrawing U.S. troops in the region. Faithful conservatives point to the contributions of Kurds who are being pummeled by the Turkish military.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds are the ones who have been leading the fight against ISIS in Syria. Also pray for the Christians who the Kurds have been protecting,\u201d the Rev. Franklin Graham tweeted last week. \u201cThey could be annihilated. Would you pray w/me that Pres. @realDonaldTrump will reconsider?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump isn\u2019t budging. He wants countries in Syria\u2019s \u201cneighborhood\u201d to settle their long-running disputes and secure the area, and he would like European nations to take back Islamic State fighters who left to join the now-destroyed \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria and Iraq.\n\nMr. Trump told the Values Voter Summit that Americans shouldn\u2019t be \u201cguarding a border between Turkey and Syria when we can\u2019t guard our own borders at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot stay there forever. We have to bring our great heroes, our great soldiers, home. It is time. It is time,\u201d he said to applause.\n\nMr. Perkins said Mr. Trump is a man of his word on ending foreign entanglements, but Christian conservatives are still worried about religious minorities in the region. He said northern Syrian had been shaping into a positive model for the rest of the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThis tree of liberty that\u2019s beginning to bud,\u201d he said, \u201ccould become nothing more than a stump.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
