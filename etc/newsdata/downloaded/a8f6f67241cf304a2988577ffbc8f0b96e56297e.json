Judge Andrew McFarlane, who presided over the case at the Court of Appeal, said: 'That core factual context does indeed establish a significant index of suspicion that the parents were engaged directly in radical or terrorist activities [in Syria].'\n\nLawyers acting for the husband and wife argued that the couple's statements should not be handed over to the police, as they had a 'right to silence'.\n\nBut three Appeal Court judges ruled in favour of the police, upholding an earlier judgment that found the handover would not breach that right, because that right only existed during the police interviews.\n\nThe statements are now with Leicestershire Police, which is assisting Greater Manchester Police with the criminal investigation.", "description": "Detectives had to release the couple on bail because they gave 'no comment' responses during interviews.
