It's actually fairly easy to set this up for yourself at home, as well.\n\nThere are a few different reasons to use a dual monitor setup on a Windows 10 computer. If you're working with multiple applications at once, using two monitors gives you more space to display everything you need.\n\nYou can also have two monitors show the same content if you're connecting your PC to a television or projector, which is useful for watching videos on a big screen, or presenting slideshows.\n\nCheck out the products mentioned in this article:\n\nHow to set up dual (or more) monitors with Windows 10\n\n1.

If you can't tell, then checking the manufacturer's website should tell you. Make sure your computer has room for the kind of connection you need, and can use it.\n\n\n\nThis is a very easy mistake to make, and it can be an expensive one if you purchase a second monitor without checking.\n\n2.

Switch them around until they're in the right position \u2014 the numbered monitor to your right in real life should be the one on the right side on-screen.\n\nIf you aren't sure which monitor is which, click \"Identify.\" Ross James/Business Insider\n\n5. Scroll down to the \"Multiple Displays\" option.\n\nIf you want your screens set up so they display different things, and your mouse cursor can move between them, select \"Extend these displays\" from the dropdown menu.\n\nSelecting \"Duplicate this display\" instead will show the same image on both screens. This is the option that's useful for PowerPoint presentations and slides.\n\nThe other options will allow you to selectively disable monitors you're not using while keeping them plugged into the desktop.\n\nThe options you should be able to see.
