So cool down and calm down, before you blow a fiery fuse!\n\nTAURUS April 21-May 21 **\n\nYou think you know how a loved one is feeling but jumping to conclusions \u2013 without checking the facts first \u2013 is a recipe for trouble today Taurus. Take the time to really talk things through.\n\nGEMINI May 22-June 21 **\n\nTwins are in the mood to be rash! Making a snappy decision seems like a good idea but it could land you in trouble. Impulsive actions could also lead to an argument or accident so pace yourself.\n\nCANCER June 22-July 23 **\n\nPlace your own issues on the backburner today Crabs. Putting others first works wonders, as you tune into the needs of family and friends. But expect some fiery words along the way.\n\nLEO July 24-Aug 23 **\n\nA colleague or relative will try to push your emotional buttons but avoid retaliating with rash words or hurtful comments. You can\u2019t control what others say but you can control your reaction!\n\nVIRGO Aug 24-Sep 23 **\n\nA relationship with a relative or neighbour could flare up, as responsibilities overtake having fun. If you keep the lines of communication open, then the storm in a tea cup will soon blow over.\n\nLIBRA Sep 24-Oct 23 ***\n\nAvoid getting drawn into arguments or misunderstandings over money today. Plus postpone creative projects for another time, as it will be difficult to connect with your artistic inner muse.\n\nSCORPIO Oct 24-Nov 22 **\n\nExpect a hectic day where you\u2019re running around all over the place.

If you run around on auto-pilot, then you\u2019re more likely to make thoughtless mistakes and careless slip-ups.\n\nCAPRICORN Dec 22-Jan 20 **\n\nFinding fault with others won\u2019t win you any friends or favours today. Children and friends are feeling particularly touchy. So avoid offering criticism \u2013 no matter how \u2018constructive\u2019 it is.\n\nAQUARIUS Jan 21-Feb 19 **\n\nYour Aquarian people skills are definitely required today, as loved ones indulge in family feuds or close friends get caught up in silly squabbles. Some deft diplomacy will see you through!\n\nPISCES Feb 20-March 20 ***\n\nThere\u2019s impulsive and erratic energy about, as the planets stir up your emotions. If you don\u2019t slow down then you could blurt out something that you later regret, so pace yourself Pisces.\n\nYOUR DAY\n\nThere\u2019s explosive energy about so tread carefully.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\nWhen you are in the mood, you can be very charming. 2020 is the year to set realistic goals and then follow them through to completion.\n\nCopyright Joanne Madeline Moore 2019", "description": "See what the stars have in store for you today.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5969/a1b65d46ce564e0eaf478e32bc53ab53.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
