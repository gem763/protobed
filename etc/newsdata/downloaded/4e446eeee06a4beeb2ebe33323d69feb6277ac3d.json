The remainder was given as a gift to an undisclosed recipient.\n\nThe longtime chief executive left Overstock in late August after proclaiming in a corporate news release that he had an affair with a convicted Russian agent and had provided important information to the U.S. Justice Department about Russian involvement in U.S. politics. He left behind plans for a \u201cdigital dividend\u201d set for next week that could only be accessed through Overstock\u2019s experimental blockchain-based exchange, and required the holder to retain the asset for six months, which many thought to be an attempt to squeeze short sellers, with whom Byrne has frequently battled publicly.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: A final chapter for Patrick Byrne\u2019s Overstock drama\n\nOverstock OSTK, -8.01% changed those plans on Wednesday, announcing that the dividend would be freely tradable upon distribution, and suggested that the change was due to pressure from the government by stating it was a reaction to \u201cfeedback we received from industry participants, investors and regulators.\u201d Overstock also moved back the distribution of the dividend and promised to announce a new record date in three to six weeks.\n\nIn a blog post on his \u201cDeep Capture\u201d website, Byrne was more specific about where he thought the pressure was coming from.\n\n\u201cWe heard over the weekend that starting last Friday, the Deep State\u2019s pets at the SEC began leaking something to their clients JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman (and here as citizens I bet you thought we were their clients, right? lol),\u201d Byrne wrote in summing up the decision to sell. \u201cThey leaked that they were going to Bazoomba our digital dividend,\u201d he said, referencing a joke regarding a poker game that Byrne has used to summarize Wall Street.\n\n\u201cOnce that started getting back to me, I realized this: Whenever I have had any question about whether the SEC would or would not do something totally outrageous in order to hurt our company to benefit their clients on Wall Street, they never let me down: they always did the evil thing,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSince February 2018, the SEC has been investigating Overstock\u2019s tZero blockchain subsidiary and its token security offering. In the company\u2019s 10Q filing in May, Overstock disclosed that the SEC had expanded its investigation to include certain public statements made by the company. Overstock has said previously it is cooperating fully with the SEC, but did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday afternoon.\n\nSee also: Paying your bills in bitcoin? Watch out for these tax issues\n\nByrne said that any suggestion that he sold the shares due to a lack of confidence in the company\u2019s prospects was \u201cwrong,\u201d and said that he would invest almost all the money in gold GCZ19, -0.73% , silver SIZ19, -0.61% and two unnamed cryptocurrencies as a \u201chedge\u201d against the economy failing and taking Overstock with it. He promised investors that if that did happen, he would recapitalize the company with his gains from the other investments.\n\n\u201dYou will have not just access to capital, you will have access to the friendliest capital imaginable: my own,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have to wait six months for it to be legal, but anytime after March 17, 2020 I can provide a capital injection if needed by buying back into Overstock. Please remember that as you watch the global chaos.\u201d\n\nByrne said he also bought into precious metals and crypto to put his money \u201coutside acts of retaliation from the Deep State,\u201d which he promised to \u201cshellac.\u201d\n\nOverstock shares hit a 52-week high last week, but took a big hit as Byrne sold, falling 20.8% Monday, 10.9% Tuesday and 8% on Wednesday. Shares fell more than 3% in after-hours trading Wednesday following the disclosure of Byrne\u2019s stock sales.", "description": "Patrick Byrne\u2019s dramatic exit from Overstock.com Inc. had a surprise second act Wednesday, as the former chief executive sold his large stake in the company...", "authors": ["Jeremy C.
