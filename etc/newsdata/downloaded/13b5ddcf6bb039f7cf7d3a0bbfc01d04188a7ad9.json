I just got a job and did it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m anything special.\u201d\n\nBut Betty remains one of Carol\u2019s stand-out winners from the 20 years she has hosted the Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB.\n\n(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster/Daily Mirror)\n\nBetty had the audience in hysterics \u2013 upstaging Bruce Forsyth by joking she was 65, 10 years younger than she was.\n\nMost of all, she won the hearts of everyone for the help she has given to the hundreds of youngsters who have passed through her terraced home in Coventry over four decades.\n\nCarol tells her: \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it, I really don\u2019t. It\u2019s your whole life, it\u2019s sharing your bathroom, your kitchen, sharing everything, and for over 40 years.\n\n\"To have that level of love and compassion, that\u2019s what makes you such a special person. I think that anyone who fosters just one child is amazing. And you\u2019ve fostered over a thousand.\u201d\n\nBetty tells Carol she has fostered another 30 or so children since they last met and the total now stands at 1,347.\n\nCarol exclaims: \u201cYou\u2019re still doing it?\u201d\n\n(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster/Daily Mirror)\n\nBetty says: \u201cI\u2019ve got two at home at the moment. A 17-year-old from Somalia who fled the country after his brother was killed. And a 14-year-old local boy who\u2019s a real Jack the Lad.\n\n\u201cHe tries it on with me, especially when he wants to come home after the 8.30pm curfew. It keeps my mind in gear because I have to be smarter than him.\u201d\n\nAnd all at the age of? \u201cEighty,\u201d says Betty immediately, adding: \u201cOh, I don\u2019t dare lie about my age anymore.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I could get away with saying I\u2019m 10 years younger any longer.\u201d\n\nHolding hands as they talk, Betty and Carol open up about their own difficult experiences in the past.\n\nBetty reveals how, before embarking on her career in fostering, she lost four babies of her own.\n\nShe says: \u201cMy first boy died a few hours after being born. I miscarried the others, including twin girls. Then I had cancer and had to have a hysterectomy. I found out that I was born with a gene that meant I was unable to carry children.\n\n\u201cBut then I look back and, when I reflect on it, I think, life\u2019s odd, isn\u2019t it? I lost four children. And for my whole life I\u2019ve been looking after four children, always four at any one time. I was meant to be a mum to hundreds of children.\u201d\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nCarol says: \u201cI hadn\u2019t even thought about this, but I now think one of the reasons you made so much of an impression on me is because my father rejected me.\n\n\u201cHe refused to see me for most of my life. He\u2019d come to see my brother and sister, but never wanted to see me. I only met him in my 40s after he finally got in touch after his wife died.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s left its scars, but that\u2019s nothing like the lives of the children you deal with. At least I had my mother.\n\n\u201cBut I feel for the children you look after and I know how much of a difference you are making in their lives.\u201d\n\nBetty says: \u201cIt\u2019s just about doing what\u2019s right and then taking each situation as it comes. Everybody knows in their heart what is the right thing to do, so as long as they are doing the right thing any problems are easy to deal with.\u201d\n\nCarol says: \u201cThis is what I mean about Betty. While most of us create problems for ourselves that don\u2019t exist, she talks herself out of problems. She should have an agony aunt column. We could all learn from her.\n\n(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster/Daily Mirror)\n\n\u201cShe sums up the spirit of Pride of Britain. It\u2019s about people who don\u2019t accept what society tells us is normal, and just do something extraordinary.\u201d\n\nBetty\u2019s story began 44 years ago after she and husband Seamus moved from Scotland to Coventry.\n\nThere, she became best friends with fellow Scot Lily Martin, who died from meningitis , leaving two daughters, aged nine and 11.\n\nBetty, then aged 36 and unable to have children, didn\u2019t hesitate in taking the girls and raising them as her own.\n\nShe says: \u201cI was with Lily in hospital and she said, \u2018I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m going to be in here, promise that you\u2019ll watch them for me\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe doctor had told me she was going to die, but Lily didn\u2019t know. I promised I would take care of them.\n\nI didn\u2019t have any second thoughts. I knew it was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nShortly afterwards, Betty, who worked for Coventry Council, was asked by social services if she and Seamus would consider fostering.\n\n(Image: Nicholas Bowman/Daily Mirror)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nThe social workers had been impressed by how she had coped with the two girls, and thought she could help look after vulnerable children.\n\nFirst to come into her loving home were three siblings, aged eight, five and four, who were meant to stay for a fortnight but were with her for 16 years. Hundreds more followed.\n\nBetty, who has been fostering alone since Seamus died 20 years ago, is also on call 24 hours a day and provides emergency care, sometimes arranging beds for children brought by police in the early hours.\n\nShe says: \u201cI\u2019ve had abused children arrive in the night, calls from police to act as an adult for a child who has either done or witnessed something horrendous, and spent weeks coaxing a child to eat, speak or come out from under the bed covers.\u201d\n\nBetty has only had to have five children removed.\n\nShe says: \u201cI have never met any bad children. Just some who are deeply affected by certain situations.\n\n\"Every day someone comes up and gives me a hug. I may have had them when they were four or five and they are now 20, but they remember me. My brother refuses to go with me into the city centre because he says the walk from the precinct to Boots takes around two days.\u201d\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nRemembering how Pride of Britain began 20 years ago, Carol, who has hosted all of them, says: \u201cIn the first year, we gave awards to celebrities. Richard Branson got businessman of the year, Mo Mowlam won politician of the year.\n\n\"Then came these awards to ordinary people, and the whole room fell silent. There were survivors of\n\nthe Omagh bombings, a man who intervened in a fight and was blinded.\n\n\u201cIt left me in floods of tears. Afterwards I said, \u2018We need to make these awards just about ordinary people\u2019.\u201d\n\nBetty says: \u201cThe award has opened so many doors. Now, when the council is making a decision about children\u2019s services, they will consult me because I\u2019m a Pride of Britain winner.\n\n\u201cThe awards are making a much greater difference to the country than people might think.\u201d\n\nThere are more hugs and kisses as Carol and Betty say their goodbyes and return to their very different lives.\n\nIt is more than an hour later that Carol texts and says, simply: \u201cShe\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t she? I love her.\u201d", "description": "Foster carer Betty McGlinchey, 80, told Pride of Britain host Carol Vorderman she'll often have four children living with her at any one time and has no plans to stop", "authors": ["Matt Roper", "Image", "Jonathan Buckmaster Daily Mirror", "Philip Coburn Daily Mirror", "Nicholas Bowman Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706787.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Carol-Vorderman-meets-2014-Pride-of-Britain-winner-Betty-McGlinchey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
