We are doing many things well. We have to keep believing in our philosophy, we have to keep believing in our team, which is the best way for us to improve.\n\n\u2018Football is about the end, not the beginning, so let\u2019s see how we finish at the end of the season in May. We have to win, we always have to win.\n\n\u2018If you want to achieve big goals, you have to think about winning, winning, winning. It\u2019ll be tough against Crystal Palace but we want the three points.\n\n\u2018I want to win titles with Arsenal, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u2019\n\nPalace are just a point and place behind Arsenal in the Premier League table ahead of their trip to the Emirates and won 3-2 in the corresponding fixture last season in April.\n\nIt is the first time that Wilfried Zaha will come up against the Gunners since their interest in him during the summer but Roy Hodgson insisted they were never close to signing the Ivorian.\n\n\u2018I believe that the money that was offered which was widely reported was reasonably accurate, and of course that was way below our valuation,\u2019 he said.", "description": "David Luiz has urged Arsenal to stick to their philosophy as they bid to bounce back from Monday's defeat to Sheffield United against Crystal Palace.", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91924009_1572086222.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
