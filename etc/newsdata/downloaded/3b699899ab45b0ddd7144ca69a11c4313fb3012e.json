REUTERS/Nerijus Adomaitis/File Photo\n\nOSLO (Reuters) - Norway\u2019s Equinor (EQNR.OL) has agreed to sell a 25% stake in Germany\u2019s Arkona offshore wind farm for around 500 million euros ($547.85 million), almost doubling the value of its investment, the company said on Thursday.\n\nThe buyers are funds advised by Credit Suisse Energy Infrastructure Partners, while Equinor will retain a 25% stake, it added.\n\nSince entering the project with a 50% stake in 2016, Equinor has invested just over 500 million euros, a company spokesman told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re satisfied with this deal and to still remain owner of a 25% stake,\u201d Equinor spokesman Eskil Eriksen said.\n\nArkona is operated by RWE Renewables, which holds a 50% stake.\n\n\u201cThis divestment demonstrates Equinor\u2019s ability to realize value from the development of offshore wind projects. Active portfolio management through the project life cycle is an important part of our offshore wind strategy,\u201d said Paal Eitrheim, head of Equinor\u2019s New Energy Solutions unit.\n\n(This story has been refilled to correct amount in third paragraph to \u201cjust over 500 million euros\u201d from \u201caround 520 million euros\u201d)", "description": "Norway's Equinor has agreed to sell a 25% stake in Germany's Arkona offshore wind farm for around 500 million euros ($547.85 million), almost doubling the value of its investment, the company said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436535785&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920C3"}
