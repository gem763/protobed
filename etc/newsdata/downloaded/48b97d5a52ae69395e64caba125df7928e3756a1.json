Oh, but no,\" Carlson said. \"Just the opposite. He transferred It. When Trudeau blames privilege he's moving responsibility for what he did from himself to the rest of us. In other words, 'I did something awful because society itself is rotten, therefore, and this is the key, therefore, I need to keep telling you how to live your life.' It's not a confession. It's a justification and the only people dumb enough to buy it are the news media, of course. The dumbest people in the world.\"\n\nCarlson played a clip of CNN's Don Lemon talking about how extremely impressed he was by Trudeau's apology.\n\n\"I do have to say this before we go. Think about it however you wanna think about it. When someone apologies, wow,\" Lemon said with a gasp. \"We don't often see that here, especially a world leader who's saying 'I should have known better and I'm sorry.' You could go about that however you want but to me, that does mean a lot.\"\n\nBut Carlson brought up one important tidbit: Lemon is impressed with Trudeau for admitting he was wrong for wearing blackface but he absolutely vilified Megyn Kelly for not being outraged enough by blackface. In other words, it's okay for a Democratic politician to wear blackface but it's not okay for a conservative woman to not be outraged enough. Translation: there are double standards. And, naturally, networks like CNN give those on the left get the benefit of the doubt.", "description": "Boom..09/20/2019 1:07:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/72/3a3aded7-0564-4a50-98a8-fe5303555d62.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
