Alongside products for the face, the range incorporates footcare products like a Moisturizing Foot Balm ($25)\n\nThe cork oak extract used in the newly-unveiled dermatologically-tested formulas has been clinically proven to improve skin moisture, boost smoothness, reduce redness and minimize the appearance of wrinkles.\n\nMulti-use: Even the refillable packaging makes reference to cork, as is seen on the bottle of the Intensive Moisturizing Cream ($80)\n\nAlongside cork oak extract, the products also boast ingredients such as avocado oil, shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera and volcanic sand.\n\nThanks to its commitment to transparency and sustainability, the product range has also been COSMOS certified, meaning it fits the 'gold standard' in natural and organic cosmetic certification.\n\nWhile most cork is first harvested when the tree is 25 years old, Birkenstock said that the cork oak complex utilized in the new skincare range is extracted from trees that are at least 43 years old because older cork is richer in essential nutrients.\n\nSaid trees can then be harvested for another 150 years or more after this process - ergo, no trees were compromised in the making of the products.\n\nBecause of its ability to regenerate its bark without being cut down, cork oak remains one of the planet\u2019s most sustainable natural resources - and that same self-regenerating ability works to rejuvenate the skin when applied topically too.\n\nEvidently working towards being a lifestyle empire in their own right, the brand quietly launched Birkenstock Sleep Systems in 2017.\n\nWellness, but make it fashion: Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow (left) and fashion star Alexa Chung (right) are regularly spotted in various shades of the brand's popular Arizona sandal\n\nFans: Actress Sienna Miller (left) and Kendall Jenner (right) are also notable fans of the comfortable footwear\n\nAgain, Birkenstock took inspiration from its cork footbed and used it for inspiration for a range of 'cork latex' mattresses that specifically support restful sleep by 'molding' to the 'contours' of the body.\n\nWith clean living at the forefront of everything it does, is it any wonder that Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow is such a big fan of the brand?\n\nThe actress and mom-of-two, 47, is regularly spotted out and about in various Birkenstock styles, such as the perennially popular Arizona sandal.\n\nSo too are Sienna Miller, Alexa Chung, Busy Philipps, Kendall Jenner, Pierce Brosnan and Jennifer Garner.\n\nMany link the rise in popularity of 'Birks' among the style-conscious set to Phoebe Philo's decision to send fur-lined Birkenstock-inspired sandals down the runway when she was at the helm of Celine in 2012.\n\nEver since, the footwear brand has become the go-to fusion of functional meets fashion, and collaborations with the likes of Rick Owens, Opening Ceremony and Valentino followed suit.", "description": "Footwear brand Birkenstock, known for its orthopedic-style sandals, has branched out into the natural beauty game as it unveils new product range incorporating skincare starting at $22.", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/22/20154594-0-image-a-35_1571951548165.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
