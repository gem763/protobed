Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.

As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy.

AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House.

Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.

He was criticized by Republicans for giving what he called a \u201cparody\u201d of the Ukraine phone call during a hearing, with Trump and others saying he had been pretending that his damning characterisation was a verbatim reading of the phone call. He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint.

The facility is one of the most luxurious of any in Brussels,\u201d one person said.\n\nGuests often found themselves invited for dinner or receptions. Mr Sondland\u2019s predecessor, Obama appointee Anthony Gardner, held annual 4 July parties there, as a brass band played and European bureaucrats, diplomats, business executives, academics and journalists chomped on hot dogs.\n\nMr Sondland has called himself a \u201cdisruptive diplomat\u201d. In public appearances and in private meetings, he has often echoed the rhetoric of his boss, Mr Trump, another hotel developer.\n\nHe once said to American business representatives that unlike his predecessors, he would \u201cget s*** done,\u201d according to people who were present. He called the EU \u201dout of touch\u201d and accused it of stalling on trade talks with the Trump administration.\n\nProcurement records show that in the years before Mr Sondland\u2019s arrival, the biggest expenses were for regular maintenance of the swimming pool, which cost between $15,000 (\u00a312,000) and $20,000 (\u00a315,000) per year, and for general upkeep and landscaping, save for a $122,000 (\u00a394,000) purchase in 2015 for refrigeration equipment, apparently for the house\u2019s catering kitchen.\n\nUnder Mr Sondland, however, the State Department has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on furniture, fabrics and what is described in documents as a \u201cfamily kitchen\u201d, at a cost of just under $223,000 (\u00a3170,000).\n\nThat project is distinct from another for a \u201cprofessional kitchen\u201d, costing about $209,000 (\u00a3160,000), the records show.\n\nBefore Mr Sondland\u2019s arrival, the home did not have a personal kitchen, and ambassadors and their families would prepare their personal meals in the professional kitchen.\n\nThe cost of the family kitchen was in line with high-end homes in Brussels, said Jorge Almada, a Brussels-based designer who has experience working on luxury projects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like in [New York City],\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThat price is within reason if it\u2019s all decked out with appliances. It\u2019s always the woodwork which is especially expensive.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
