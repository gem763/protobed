This time last year, Venice pulled out a corker of a programme \u2013 Roma, The Favourite, Sunset, a posthumous Orson Welles feature \u2013 and we all said that Cannes would have to raise its game accordingly. Well, this year Cannes did raise its game, while Venice discreetly returned to being solid but less than indispensable. The 76th festival had its gems, but was short on real excitement \u2013 although, as befits our age, the real buzz came less from the films than from the social media that amassed around them.\n\nArguably the biggest controversy this year, providing ripples that extended beyond the Lido, came from a mainstream Hollywood production, but an unusually dark one \u2013 Todd Phillips\u2019s Joker, a sombre, arguably nihilistic spin on the Batman villain. It was a tour de force for Joaquin Phoenix, and a flamboyantly knowing tip of the hat to certain Martin Scorsese movies. The film itself was all but eclipsed by the Twitter storm it provoked \u2013 was it really a message of empowerment to incels and other embittered social outsiders? \u2013 but it is certainly one of the boldest Hollywood productions for some time.\n\nAmong the dominant flavours of Venice 2019 were despair and damnation, making this year at times quite indigestibly apocalyptic. If Joker\u2019s unalloyed bleakness was the very antithesis of superhero escapism, it was easily outdone for sheer moral and visual horror by Czech director V\u00e1clav Marhoul\u2019s The Painted Bird, a near three-hour adaptation of Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski\u2019s now largely forgotten 1965 bestseller, which followed a young boy on his travels through a second world war landscape resembling a medieval hell. From the word go, there was no imaginable atrocity that was not inflicted on the boy, assorted other adults and animals and, indeed, the audience (and that includes the dubbing of Harvey Keitel and Julian Sands). The film is painstakingly executed, magnificently photographed in black and white, and was much admired by some; for me, it was a grisly parody of the more authentic darkness of the Hungarian director B\u00e9la Tarr, to whom its aesthetic owes a lot.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joaquin Phoenix in Joker: \u2018one of the boldest Hollywood productions for some time\u2019. Photograph: Niko Tavernise\n\nDifferently ordeal-like was Oliver Hermanus\u2019s Moffie, which evoked the brutality faced by white South African army conscripts in the 1980s, especially if they were gay (the title is an Afrikaans homophobic slur). A sort of sub-equatorial Full Metal Jacket, this was in no way pleasurable, but it had the ring of brutal authenticity and some terrific performances from a young cast who boldly submit to its boot camp rigours.\n\nBut for bleakness with a leavening touch of gallows humour, there was respite in About Endlessness from Roy Andersson, the Swedish auteur who won Venice\u2019s top prize, the Golden Lion, in 2014 with his snappily titled A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence. Andersson is the most deadpan and consistent of jokers. About Endlessness is his fourth film in which the human condition is enacted in a series of elaborately staged vignettes, acted out by performers made up to resemble whey-faced extras in a zombie movie.\n\nLargely set in Andersson\u2019s own version of Stockholm, it also features a Chagall-like couple flying over a ruined city, a defeated army marching off to Siberia, and a glimpse of Hitler\u2019s bunker, where his weary generals can barely muster a \u201cSieg Heil!\u201d. If you\u2019re willing to tune in to Andersson\u2019s unique, visionary brand of anti-cinema, it\u2019s one of the best things here, albeit no departure.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest V\u00e1clav Marhoul\u2019s gruelling second world war epic The Painted Bird, \u2018in which no imaginable atrocity was not inflicted on the boy\u2019. Photograph: Jan Dobrovsk\u00fd\n\nThere were some significant big-name disappointments in and out of competition, and the true-life dramas weren\u2019t remotely as incisive as Venice\u2019s best documentaries \u2013 notably Lauren Greenfield\u2019s The Kingmaker, a terrifying portrait of Imelda Marcos and the legacy of a power broker who simply will not let go of dynastic influence. In the docudrama realm, Olivier Assayas offered a sprawling story of Cuban-American espionage, Wasp Network, with a cast including Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, but without the nail-biting focus of the director\u2019s previous true-espionage epic Carlos.\n\nThen there was Benedict Andrews\u2019s Seberg, about the latter days of film star Jean Seberg, persecuted by the CIA for her involvement with black power activists; a lifeless dud, it featured that barely imaginable rarity, a listless Kristen Stewart performance. Steven Soderbergh\u2019s The Laundromat was an episodic, smart-arsed account of international financial chicanery, as exposed in the Panama Papers, with Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas as J\u00fcrgen Mossack and Ram\u00f3n Fonseca, winking to camera in the finance for dummies style of The Big Short. It\u2019s a horribly self-satisfied film, the absolute tooth-grater of the festival.\n\nThe Laundromat was one of three Netflix films here; the others were Noah Baumbach\u2019s Marriage Story (see below) and a laborious, revisionist take on the Henry V story, David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s The King, with a solemn Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Hal, rising to the challenge of wearing the crown. The battle scenes, when they came, were great \u2013 hardly the glorious Agincourt of the Laurence Olivier version \u2013 but the film is distinguished mainly by a nicely downbeat turn from Joel Edgerton, who co-wrote a verbally rich script and plays Falstaff as a canny, no-nonsense military strategist, rather like a pragmatic second-division football manager.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brad Pitt in Ad Astra. Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Duhamel\n\nOther established names did better at the start of the week. James Gray offered an enjoyable, all-out loopy space adventure, Ad Astra, with Brad Pitt heading to the ends of the universe in search of the meaning of it all, and in search of his dad (an inimitably grouchy Tommy Lee Jones). Roman Polanski, whose personal reputation meant that many were unhappy about him being in competition at all, actually came up trumps with An Officer and a Spy, about the 1890s Dreyfus case. For some, Polanski making a film about a case of unjust accusation was downright cheek, but this was a more than solid historical drama \u2013 a little academic, but gripping and cogent, with sometime joker Jean Dujardin (The Artist) excelling in all seriousness as the intelligence officer who unravels the true facts.\n\nAnd then, triumphantly, there was Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach\u2019s acidic dramedy about a theatrical couple (Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver) splitting up, the divide between LA and New York cultures paralleling their emotional schism. Both leads are dazzling, as are Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta as their attorneys; by the time Driver sings a solo version of Sondheim\u2019s Being Alive, this profound, pitiless film hadn\u2019t left a dry eye in the house.\n\nAnother Venice controversy came before the festival when the programme was announced, and it was revealed that there were only two films by women in competition \u2013 scant improvement on last year\u2019s meagre one. One of the two felt like a good-intentions inclusion: The Perfect Candidate, by Saudi director Haifaa al-Mansour. About a young woman doctor attempting to buck the Saudi patriarchy by standing as a local councillor, it was a passionate and very necessary drama, but lukewarm as cinema. But something else again was Australian first feature Babyteeth by Shannon Murphy, who immediately put her wayward stamp on this tragicomedy adapted by Rita Kalnejais from her own play. It\u2019s about a suburban teenager with cancer (Eliza Scanlen), who takes up with a local bad boy, to the horror of her very dysfunctional parents (Ben Mendelsohn; The Babadook\u2019s superb Essie Davis). With dazzling colour choices, off-key wit and a wild sense of mischief, this was the freshest discovery here.\n\nThe best of Venice\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anders Hellstr\u00f6m and Tatiana Delaunay in Roy Andersson\u2019s About Endlessness.
