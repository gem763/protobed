There was no hairdryer. He knew it wouldn\u2019t serve much use at that moment. They felt bad enough.\n\nBy the time Pochettino did come out of the dressing room to speak to the media, however, there was one particular piece of analysis getting repeatedly stated. It was that this 7-2 was really just a freak case of pretty much everything Bayern Munich hitting going in.\n\n\u201cThey scored with every touch,\u201d Pochettino argued, and it wasn\u2019t just him saying it. Opposing manager Nico Kovac backed him up.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It didn\u2019t happen that much the other way around.\u201d\n\nMany of the stats back this up, particularly the xG. Bayern scored about three or four goals that, probability-wise, shouldn\u2019t really have gone in. Hence it felt like absolutely everything they hit went in, and was thereby an outlier of a game.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That is undeniably true - but it doesn\u2019t mean it was a total freak.\n\nOne of the reasons everything Bayern hit went in was because they were in the mood to try anything. There was that marked mental shift in the game.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that Spurs had stopped pressing, in the way that was proving very effective in that impressive opening 40 minutes. It was that much more about their game had given way.\n\nTheir sharpness went, replaced by a laxness. They had gone from relentlessly closing space to so casually offering it up. Sensing this vulnerability, and buoyed by their own resilience, Bayern just went with it and went for them.\n\nThey pounced on everything. There was that predatory hunger to every Spurs slip, best displayed by the sensational Serge Gnabry and peerless Robert Lewandowski.\n\nEven though Pochettino pointed to the last seven minutes as the spell where things really collapsed - and when Bayern scored three to really turn this from an exacting defeat to an absolute thrashing - it was a dynamic summed up by the third goal; the one that really started it all off.\n\nSerge Aurier was a little lax in getting too far ahead of Gnabry, but the young forward took maximum advantage, with maximum application. He so fluidly rode Aurier\u2019s desperate attempt at a challenge before charging purposefully at goal and then finishing with full conviction. There was no doubt in his mind.\n\nThere was the realisation that Spurs were there for the taking, and that spread. The big question now is how far it will spread, in all senses.\n\nIt is ultimately why this was not just Pochettino\u2019s worst ever defeat in terms of pure numbers. It was also his worst in terms of the feel of it, the potential meaning, and why it can\u2019t just be completely dismissed as a freak.\n\nThat is why it presents far greater problems than just as regards the chances of getting through this group or getting the players back up on their feet.\n\nIt does give some greater form to the growing suggestions that it\u2019s just gone \u201cstale\u201d, that the management are struggling to shake them out of this.\n\nThere have after all already been team meetings to discuss issues. There have already been \u201cclear-the-airs\u201d. And yet the air around the club now is not that optimistic.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean this is insurmountable. Some of what Pochettino said remains true. But for a defeat this bad to happen this early? For a team to sense that they were coming apart at the seams here; that they could be so easily got at?\n\nThat maybe says even more than the score, or any statement.", "description": "As the humiliated Tottenham\u00a0players trudged back into the dressing room immediately after such a humbling, Mauricio Pochettino knew it was pointless to say too much.
