But they really want a down payment on their socialized medicine scheme,\u201d says the television ad featuring shots of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont.\n\nMs. Pelosi unveiled legislation last month aimed at reducing drug prices that would put the government in charge of negotiating a \u201cfair price\u201d for the 250 most expensive patent-protected pharmaceuticals, with companies that fail to cooperate facing a 65% escalating excise tax on sales.\n\nCoalition executive director Marc Palazzo said the \u201csocialist price controls are a threat to patients, innovation, and the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would hinder access to and degrade quality of care, serve as a death-knell for innovation, and impose crippling new taxes of up to 95% on the medicines patients depend on,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis plan is nothing more than the first step of a total government takeover of the health care system \u2013 a dream for a San Francisco liberal, but a nightmare for patients, innovators, and taxpayers.\u201d\n\n.@SpeakerPelosi\u2019s drug pricing proposal will have DANGEROUS consequences for patient access and quality of care, innovation, and taxpayers. We are proud to join @SayNo2SocialMed to stop Pelosi and the Socialists\u2019 government takeover of healthcare https://t.co/QZdm7S9lPz \u2014 Club for Growth (@club4growth) October 7, 2019\n\n\n\nRepublicans, including President Trump, have also sought to lower pharmaceutical costs, but the Pelosi-backed bill short-circuited bipartisan efforts in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, prompting ranking member Rep. Greg Walden to accuse Democrats of putting \u201cpolitics over progress.\u201d\n\nMs. Pelosi has argued that the bill, which also sets an out-of-pocket $2,000 cap for Medicare co-pays, would boost innovation by reinvesting \u201csavings\u201d from the lower negotiated prices to research at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cIt stops drug companies from ripping off Americans while charging other countries less for the drug,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said at a Sept. 19 press conference.\n\nSoaring drug prices impact everyone, from millennials to middle aged parents to seniors. Thankfully, leaders like @RepLBR are spreading the word about @HouseDemocrats\u2018 efforts to #LowerDrugCosts for Americans nationwide. pic.twitter.com/O01OcRE9PA \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) October 4, 2019\n\n\n\nCritics argue that there\u2019s a way to lower out-of-pockets costs for consumers without putting research at risk. Of new drugs introduced between 2011-18, 89% are available in the United States, as opposed to 62% in Germany and 60% in the United Kingdom, according to the Galen Institute.\n\nEuropean drug firms once led U.S. companies by 24% in spending on research and development, but since the introduction of price controls, Europe now trails U.S. investment by 40%.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. emulates the European price-setting example, innovation here almost certainly will suffer,\u201d said the Galen Institute\u2019s Doug Badger.\n\nThe ad campaign, timed to Mr. Trump\u2019s speech Thursday on health care at the Villages retirement community in Florida, where he signed an executive order once titled, \u201cProtecting Medicare From Socialist Destruction,\u201d but renamed, \u201cProtecting and Improving Medicare for Our Nation\u2019s Seniors.\u201d\n\nThe coalition\u2019s members include Heritage Action, FreedomWorks, the National Taxpayers Union, Club for Growth, Citizens Against Government Waste, American Commitment, and the Committee to Unleash Prosperity.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
