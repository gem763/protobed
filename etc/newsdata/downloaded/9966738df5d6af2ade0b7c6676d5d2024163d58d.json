The only time new claims have been lower was when they dipped below 200,000 in April around the Easter holiday.\n\nEconomists polled by MarketWatch estimated new claims would total a seasonally adjusted 213,000.\n\nEven if the holiday and the hurricane caused the big drop in applications, the low level of new claims still show muscular labor market that has shown little wear and tear from a slowing U.S economy\n\nRead: For the first time in 11 years, 80% of Americans in their prime are working\n\nWhat happened: Actual or unadjusted jobless claims fell the most in the largest states: California, New York, Illinois, Texas and Pennsylvania. No state reported any big increases.\n\nThe more stable monthly average of new claims fell by a smaller 5,250 to 212,500, an almost two-month low. The four-week average gives a more accurate read into labor-market conditions than the more volatile weekly number.\n\nThe number of people already collecting unemployment benefits, known as continuing claims, dipped by 4,000 to 1.67 million.\n\nRead: U.S. manufacturing index falls below key 50 mark that sometimes signals recession\n\nBig picture: The trade war with China, a slump among American manufacturers and a slowing U.S. economy have done little to cool off the most vibrant labor market in decades.\n\nSo far.\n\nEconomists are watching closely to see if layoffs start to rise, a sign that companies are feeling more stress. But as long as most Americans keep their jobs the U.S. is likely to keep growing steadily and avoid recession.\n\nRead: U.S. consumers are far from spent and that\u2019s a lifesaver for a wobbly economy\n\nMarket reaction: Market reaction:The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.85% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.72% were set to open higher in Thursday trades.
