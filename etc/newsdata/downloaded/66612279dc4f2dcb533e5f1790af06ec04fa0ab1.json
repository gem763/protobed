Of that total, less than $14 billion has been received.\n\nNuestra portada de hoy. \ud83d\udcf0 Busca nuestra r\u00e9plica digital del peri\u00f3dico impreso en https://t.co/bcbzFQBplk pic.twitter.com/zm8O6OEzTd \u2014 El Nuevo D\u00eda (@ElNuevoDia) August 30, 2019\n\nBut Trump has long disregarded the numbers, instead insisting that the island has been paid several times the actual amount.\n\n\u201cWow! Yet another big storm heading to Puerto Rico. Will it ever end?\u201d he tweeted Tuesday, erroneously stating once again that Congress has approved $92 billion for the island, calling it \u201can all time record of its kind for \u2018anywhere.\u2019\u201d\n\nWow!

Congress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year, an all time record of its kind for \u201canywhere.\u201d \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2019\n\nThe president also made the claim in July, days before Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 announced his resignation amid protests over the leak of his crude messages to advisers and federal corruption charges against two of his administration\u2019s former top officials.\n\nIn a pair of tweets that month, Trump took the opportunity to attack the island, claiming \u201cCongress foolishly gave 92 Billion Dollars for hurricane relief, much of which was squandered away or wasted, never to be seen again.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, as Puerto Rico was readying itself for the arrival of Hurricane Dorian, which mainly missed the area on its way toward Florida, Trump called the island \u201cone of the most corrupt places on earth\u201d and slammed its politicians as \u201cincompetent.\u201d\n\nThough the president has deemed himself \u201cthe best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico,\u201d he is part of the reason it has been slow to receive aid. In June, The Washington Post reported that he had finally signed a disaster relief bill that he had delayed for months in opposition to the funds.", "description": "The president has repeatedly and falsely claimed that $92 billion in aid has been granted to the island.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6a7fb82500008d0000de89.jpeg?cache=jdx901j4k0&ops=1778_1000"}
