(Ed Zurga/AP)\n\nIt\u2019s Week 1 of the NFL season, and we again will be highlighting weekly matchups in which the implied odds of winning are significantly higher than the actual odds. Our league-projection formula helps determine how often one team should beat another based on actual and projected win rates. That gives us win probabilities for every game, as well as an implied margin of victory \u2014 helpful for picking games against the spread.\n\nIn light of last year\u2019s underwhelming performance (a 16-21-1 record in best bets), we made some tweaks to this year\u2019s model, including less reliance on a team\u2019s actual win-loss record and more weight on how teams are expected to perform in the future. There will also be more flexibility in adjusting for injuries, especially at quarterback.\n\nWith that in mind, here are this week\u2019s prime picks against the consensus point spreads from multiple sports books in Las Vegas.\n\n[NFL expert picks for 2019 season: Who will win the Super Bowl?]\n\nIndianapolis Colts at Los Angeles Chargers (-6.5)\n\nPick: Los Angeles Chargers -6.5\n\nThe Colts will be without four-time Pro Bowl quarterback Andrew Luck after he abruptly retired and instead will rely on backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett. The change under center is massive. Luck was the fifth most valuable quarterback of 2018, per ESPN\u2019s Total Quarterback rating, while Brissett was the 27th most valuable passer out of 30 qualified quarterbacks in 2017, the only year he started more than two games.\n\nThe Chargers, meanwhile, boast the fourth-best pass-rushing unit of 2019, per Pro Football Focus, which seems likely to keep Brissett uncomfortable in the pocket. During Brissett\u2019s 2017 campaign, his passer rating dropped from 91.5 in a clean pocket to 61.1 when faced with a pass rush. His completion rate dropped from 65 percent to 45 percent when under pressure, as well.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (-3) at Carolina Panthers\n\nPick: Los Angeles Rams -3\n\nThe Rams have everything they need to be successful in 2019. Coach Sean McVay has given quarterback Jared Goff plenty of offensive tools, including running back Todd Gurley and wideouts Brandin Cooks, Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp. Pro Football Focus gives Los Angeles high marks for both its offensive and defensive lines, too, with the key matchup of this Week 1 game involving Aaron Donald against Carolina\u2019s offensive line, projected to be the 18th best in the league in 2019.\n\nDonald led the league in sacks (20\u00bd) and was PFF\u2019s highest-rated interior lineman last year, with 20 hits and 65 hurries over 913 pass-rush snaps. If he can make life uncomfortable for Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, who injured his foot during the preseason, the defending NFC champions should get off to a fine start.\n\nHighest pressure percentage, interior D-Linemen (2015-18):\n\n\n\n1. Aaron Donald 17.8%\n\n2. Geno Atkins 14.8\n\n3. Fletcher Cox 14.2\n\n4. Chris Jones 13.3\n\n5. Sheldon Richardson 12.6\n\n6. Malik Jackson 12.3\n\n7. Mike Daniels 12.1\n\n8. Kawann Short 11.4\n\n9. Jurrell Casey 11.0\n\n10. Cameron Heyward 10.9 \u2014 Steve Palazzolo (@PFF_Steve) July 24, 2019\n\nSan Francisco 49ers at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Pick 'em)\n\nPick: San Francisco 49ers\n\nThe 49ers welcome back quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo as their offensive leader after he suffered an ACL tear last September. The 27-year-old passer competed 64.8 percent of his passes in a San Francisco uniform for 2,278 yards, 12 touchdowns and eight interceptions over two brief seasons, and he is by all accounts ready to lead the 49ers back into playoff contention.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, Garoppolo produced a 94.1 passer rating while the rest of San Francisco\u2019s quarterbacks produced a 77.1 passer rating.\n\n***\n\n[Ezekiel Elliott cashed in with a massive deal. The numbers say he isn\u2019t worth it.]\n\nThe three games above represent our best plays of the week because our analysis shows the point spreads are the most divergent from what we expect to happen once the teams take the field. Below, you will find picks for the other games on this week\u2019s schedule. However, trying to pick every single NFL game is something of a fool\u2019s errand. The house wins so often partly because bettors try to make too many plays when the odds aren\u2019t in their favor. Keep that in mind when evaluating the remaining games from the Week 1 slate.\n\nGreen Bay Packers at Chicago Bears (-3)\n\nPick: Green Bay Packers +3\n\nTennessee Titans at Cleveland Browns (-5\u00bd)\n\nPick: Cleveland Browns -5\u00bd\n\nKansas City Chiefs (-4) at Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nPick: Kansas City Chiefs -4\n\nBaltimore Ravens (-7) at Miami Dolphins\n\nPick: Baltimore Ravens -7\n\nAtlanta Falcons at Minnesota Vikings (-4)\n\nPick: Minnesota Vikings -4\n\nBuffalo Bills at New York Jets (-3)\n\nPick: New York Jets -3\n\nWashington Redskins at Philadelphia Eagles (-9\u00bd)\n\nPick: Philadelphia Eagles -9\u00bd\n\nCincinnati Bengals at Seattle Seahawks (-9\u00bd)\n\nPick: Seattle Seahawks -9\u00bd\n\nDetroit Lions (-2\u00bd) at Arizona Cardinals\n\nPick: Detroit Lions -2\u00bd\n\nNew York Giants at Dallas Cowboys (-7)\n\nPick: Dallas Cowboys -7\n\nPittsburgh Steelers at New England Patriots (-6)\n\nPick: New England Patriots -6\n\nHouston Texans at New Orleans Saints (-7)\n\nPick: New Orleans Saints -7\n\nDenver Broncos at Oakland Raiders (Pick 'em)\n\nPick: Denver Broncos\n\nRead more on the NFL\n\nEzekiel Elliott and the Cowboys reach agreement on massive new deal\n\nAaron Rodgers can do it all.
