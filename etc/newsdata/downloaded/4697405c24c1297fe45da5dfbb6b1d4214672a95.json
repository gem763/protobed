Apple's Tim Cook speaks during a product launch event in Cupertino\n\n(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O: ) on Friday disputed a Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) research note which stated that the company's plans to account for the trial of its new streaming service Apple TV+ will have a \"material negative impact\" on its results.\n\n\"We do not expect the introduction of Apple TV+, including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material impact on our financial results,\" Apple told Reuters.\n\nGoldman Sachs had earlier cut its price target on Apple saying its plans to account for the Apple TV+ trial would likely hurt its average selling prices, gross profits and earnings per share.\n\nShares of the company, which fell as much as 2.7% in the day, cut losses by more than 1% on the news. They were last down about 1.7% at $219.17 in afternoon trading.\n\nA spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs said the bank declined to comment on the matter beyond what was stated in the analyst's note.", "description": "Apple counters Goldman call on 'negative impact' of Apple TV+ trial", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8C22W_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
