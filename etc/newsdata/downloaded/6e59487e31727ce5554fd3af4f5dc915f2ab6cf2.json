USA TODAY\n\nIn the opening minutes of Paul Rudd's comedy series \"Living With Yourself\" on Netflix, Rudd rolls up to a massage parlor located in a strip mall.\n\nAnd who else would exit but ... New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady?\n\nThe six-time Super Bowl champion makes a cameo that is quite the nod to the legal trouble Patriots owner Robert Kraft found himself in earlier this year for his trips to the Orchids of Asia spa in Jupiter, Florida that led to two counts of soliciting prostitution.\n\nThe name of the spa Brady exits in the show is \"Top Happy Spa.\" Brady, sporting a smile and confident strut, strolls past Rudd to a black SUV. Rudd sticks his head out of his car and Brady asks if it's his first time there.\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Rudd responds. \"You?\"\n\n\"Six,\" Brady says with a slight shake of his head as he enters the car.\n\nShow creator Tim Greenberg wrote the script for the show, including the Brady cameo, four years ago \u2014 long before the Kraft revelations. Greenberg and Rudd never thought Brady would agree to the part amid Kraft's ongoing legal battles related to the case.\n\nBut he did, and the scene was shot in a Boston-area hotel parking lot during the offseason.\n\n\"Nobody seemed to check every box like Tom Brady,\" Rudd said. \"He's kind of the epitome of excellence in just about every category.\"\n\nBrady has done cameos before. He appeared on HBO's \"Entourage\" more than a decade ago and showed up in another Mark Whalberg production, \"Ted 2,\" in 2015.\n\nActing aside, Brady is doing fine for himself on the field this season. The Patriots are 6-0 and he is completing 65.4% of his passes with 10 touchdowns.\n\nContributing: Gary Levin", "description": "In Paul Rudd's Netflix comedy series \"Living With Yourself,\" Patriots QB Tom Brady spoofs Patriots owner Robert Kraft with a massage parlor cameo.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published P.M.
