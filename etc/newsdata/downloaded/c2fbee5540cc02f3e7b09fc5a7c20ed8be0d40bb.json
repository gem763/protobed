They cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface and contain 97% of the planet's water. A weather phenomenon known as the \"blob\" is impacting the world's largest ocean, the Pacific.\n\nThe creatures at a San Diego rescue center are getting a second chance at life. Seaworld's Jody Westberg expects to release the sea lions early next year and is dreading what could happen next.\n\n\"On average, Seaworld rescues 150 to 200 marine animals and then in 2015, we rescued over 1,000 marine mammals,\" Westberg said. \"We are preparing for another thousand animal year.\"\n\nA \"thousand animal year,\" sparked by what's known as the \"blob,\" a sci-fi sounding term for ocean heatwaves made worse by . The blob is responsible for toxic algae blooms that kill plankton, a key food source for marine life.\n\nThe \"blob\" is responsible for toxic algae blooms that kill plankton, a key food source for marine life. CBS News\n\nOceanographer Melissa Carter measures water temperatures and algae levels. She's concerned that the massive blob that formed in the Pacific in 2015 is now reforming.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of Pacific temperatures then and now show striking similarities. Some areas are 12 degrees above normal. Another blob could decimate the shellfish industry, as it did in 2015.\n\nWhile the fish at Seattle's Pike Place Market are considered safe for now, a Washington state lab is conducting regular tests by blending them and measuring for toxins.\n\n\n\n\"The ocean is critical. It's the most critical piece of giving us a moderate climate on Earth,\" Carter said.\n\nExperts warn marine life could be harmed by rising ocean temperatures. CBS News\n\nBut once again in the Pacific, what was moderate is now extreme, leaving an uncertain future for animals.\n\n\"They're really letting us know what's going on with the ocean's health. What's impacting them is eventually gonna impact us,\" Westberg said.\n\nIn our \"Eye on Earth\" series, we're looking ahead to a landmark United Nations Climate Action Summit next week.
