But it has been seeking new ways to grow in the face of competition from startups including short video apps Douyin and Kuaishou.\n\nThe company, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, launched image-sharing app Oasis on Monday. Local media likened it to Facebook Inc\u2019s Instagram app as it had a similar interface and allowed users to browse, share and edit photos and videos through the app. Instagram is blocked in China.\n\nBy Wednesday, it ranked as one of the top free apps on Apple Inc\u2019s Chinese App Store.\n\nBut Weibo then took the app offline after a microblogger said the logo was nearly identical to one designed by a Korean movie studio for the Ulju Mountain Film Festival in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe apologize to the designer and also to our friends that care for us!\u201d the app said in a Weibo post. \u201cWe especially thank the user who flagged this to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have initiated an internal inspection of our design process and contacted the designer to solve the copyright issue,\u201d it said.\n\nOasis said it will relaunch the app \u201csoon\u201d.\n\nA Weibo representative did not immediately respond to an emailed request by Reuters for comment.", "description": "Chinese microblogging website Weibo Corp has taken down an Instagram-like app just three days after its launch and apologized following accusations of plagiarism about the app's logo, in a stumble for efforts to find new sources of growth.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
