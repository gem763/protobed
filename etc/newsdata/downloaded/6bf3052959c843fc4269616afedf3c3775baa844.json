The 30-second clip, titled \u201cBiden Corruption,\u201d is running on several national cable networks and online. To run the ad, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign spent $8 million, while the Republican National Committee (RNC) chipped in $2 million.\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson TJ Ducklo responded angrily to Facebook\u2019s decision, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said that the flow of \u201cobjectively false information to influence public opinion poisons the public discourse and chips away at our democracy.\u201d He did not comment on the substance of the ad\u2019s claims.\n\nLast Monday, CNN announced it had rejected to run the ad, claiming the video \u201cdoes not meet our advertising standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecifically, in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN,\u201d the network said in a statement.\n\nTim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 campaign\u2019s communications director, ripped into CNN\u2019s decision, accusing the network of \u201cspend[ing] all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming.\u201d\n\n\u201c[I]t\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re shielding him from truthful advertising too, and then talking to other media outlets about it,\u201d Murtaugh told the Daily Beast of the former vice president. \u201cOur ad is entirely accurate and was reviewed by counsel, and CNN wouldn\u2019t even describe to us what they found objectionable. This isn\u2019t a cable news channel anymore, it\u2019s a Democrat public relations firm.\u201d", "description": "Facebook has rejected a request from Joe Biden's 2020 campaign to remove a video ad by President Donald Trump's re-election campaign.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1173655366-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
