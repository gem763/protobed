Some people are adamant that they want to spend most of their money before they pass away, and then distribute whatever is left to their favorite charitable causes.\n\nIf you and your financial advisor agree that you truly have more than enough money to last for what is an increasingly long life expectancy in the United States, and you are not concerned about drawing down your portfolio's assets, you can consider increasing your annual withdrawal to 7% or even 8% based on your level of wealth, lifestyle and expenses.\n\nJust be sure to have regular check-ins with your financial advisor to confirm you are not overspending and are still on track.\n\nThis strategy is not, however, recommended for people who want to pass on their estate to others or have other circumstances that would make 7% or 8% far too high of an annual distribution.\n\n[See: How to Invest in Real Estate Without Buying Property.]\n\nWhichever percentage you choose to withdraw from your retirement savings each year, it is critical to make the decision alongside a financial professional who knows your portfolio, lifestyle and estate plan.\n\nA secure retirement strategy is most certainly always the best one.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore From US News & World Report\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Retirees often follow what is known as the 4% rule.
