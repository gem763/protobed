Breaking a long-held grand jury rule could solve it.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201c[We thought] we was gonna see them get beat up,\u201d Adams said with a rueful laugh during a 2017 interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution where he recounted the scene. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t funny after that.\u201d\n\nAdams, 10 years old at the time, didn\u2019t come forward with his account for more than 40 years; parts of his claim have been supported and disputed in the decades since, AJC reports. If Adams saw what he claims to have seen in 1946, he would be the only living witness to what is now widely considered \u201cAmerica\u2019s last mass lynching.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrom archival news accounts and court records, this much is certain: Four black residents \u2014 Roger Malcom, 24; his 7-months-pregnant common-law wife, Dorothy Dorsey Malcom, 20; her brother George Dorsey, 28, and his wife, Mae Murray Dorsey, 24 \u2014 were pulled from a car that summer evening, bound, beaten and dragged to a clearing along the Apalachee River. The couples were shot more than 60 times at close range by an all-white mob.\n\nPublic records leave frustratingly little for investigators to pursue today. In the aftermath of the lynchings, the surrounding community refused to cooperate; four days after the crime, William J. Spence, the head of the Georgia State Police at the time, told the Associated Press that state officials had hit a \u201cstone wall\u201d in the investigation.\n\n\u201cWe have talked to a lot of people and got nowhere,\u201d Spence said. \u201cWe think we know who some of the members of the mob are, but we can\u2019t prove it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven after the FBI investigated at the behest of President Harry S. Truman, the case remained a mystery. In six months, the FBI subpoenaed more than 100 witnesses and conducted nearly 2,800 interviews. The effort failed to yield a single confession, let alone an indictment.\n\nSeventy-three years later, the unsolved crime is now at the heart of a federal appellate court trial over grand jury secrecy.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit heard arguments that pit the historic significance of secret grand jury records \u2014 ones the plaintiffs argue could help shed light on the unsolved case \u2014 against the government\u2019s interest in preserving the confidentiality it argues is critical to maintaining the integrity of a powerful judicial tool.\n\nAD\n\nTranscripts from weeks of grand jury investigation in 1946 were thought to have been lost or destroyed until the late historian and author Antony Pitch discovered them in the National Archives, according to Joseph Bell, who is representing Pitch\u2019s estate. A federal judge in Georgia agreed to unseal the records in 2017, but the Department of Justice appealed the decision. A three-judge panel from the 11th Circuit upheld the ruling, but the decision was later vacated when the full bench of 12 judges decided to hear the case.\n\nAD\n\nThe day after the hearing, Bell told The Washington Post it was hard to tell how the judges might rule, but noted they seemed concerned their \u201cinherent supervisory authority\u201d could be undermined by what\u2019s known as \u201cRule 6,\u201d guidelines in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that establish the rule of grand jury secrecy.\n\nBell said the justices further implied that while they could affirm the lower court\u2019s decision and unseal the transcripts, the plaintiffs could pursue the material under the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act, a 2018 law that in some cases permits the release of criminal investigations records for alleged civil rights violations that took place between 1940 and 1980.\n\nAD\n\nJuliet Sorensen, a professor at Northwestern Law who spent seven years as an assistant U.S. attorney, said grand jury secrecy is crucial to the presumption of innocence and due process \u2014 such as cases where someone is investigated but no indictment is produced. The government also has an interest in preserving grand jury secrecy to help protect the integrity of a grand jury investigation, she said.\n\nAD\n\nThe set of circumstances for which grand jury information may be unsealed is small. When a grand jury participant goes on to testify at an actual trial, their grand jury testimony may be unsealed for the purposes of a cross-examination; it can also happen when a defendant alleges impropriety in the grand jury investigation or when an outside court \u2014 such as a foreign government, military tribunal or Native American tribal court \u2014 requests the grand jury information for a prosecution. A 1984 ruling by the same appeals court that\u2019s deciding the current case established precedent for judges unsealing grand jury records in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \u2014 which the court did not define.\n\n\u201cIf this isn\u2019t an exceptional circumstance, what is?\u201d Sorensen said of the Moore\u2019s Ford lynching materials. \u201cIt\u2019s now 73 years in the past. Surely, no targets of the investigation are still living. I don\u2019t believe that granting the release of the records in this case will open the door to courts ordering grand jury record disclosures willy-nilly.\u201d\n\nProponents of the unsealing point to some of the details of the lynching that have been unclear for years, including the lynching\u2019s possible ties to then-Georgia Gov. Eugene Talmadge (D) and the Ku Klux Klan. News reports at the time and court files at the very least establish a firm timeline of the events.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLoy Harrison, a wealthy white landowner, was driving the couples home from the Walton County Jail. Earlier that day, Dorothy Dorsey Malcom had convinced Harrison, her boss, to post bail for Roger Malcom, who had been in jail for 11 days for allegedly stabbing a white man during a dispute. In exchange, Malcom, a World War II veteran, would work on Harrison\u2019s farm. A second couple \u2014 Dorothy\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, who also worked for Harrison \u2014 accompanied her.\n\nHarrison would later tell investigators after the lynching that a dozen cars and at least 20 men blocked his path as he neared the Apalachee River; the mob pulled Malcom from the car and said, \u201cwe want that n-----.\u201d Harrison, who was considered an early suspect in the case but never indicted, said that while none of the men wore masks, he couldn\u2019t identify anyone. Harrison was identified in a later FBI report as a former Klansman; civil rights activists at the time alleged he bailed Malcom out to hand him over to the mob.\n\nAll but the youngest adult suspects and witnesses would be more than 100 years old today; more recent probes into the case by the FBI and Georgia Bureau of Investigations have determined any likely eyewitnesses have died. Investigators are left to parse accounts heavily based on rumors and hearsay as firsthand memories of the unsolved crime fade with each year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAtanya L. Hayes, the granddaughter of Robert Malcom, is eager to know the details of how an entire town fell silent in the wake of her grandfather\u2019s murder. Her father was only 2 when Malcom died, and Hayes, 49, said she heard only \u201cbits and pieces\u201d about what happened to him growing up. Her father carried a photo of her grandfather around in his wallet, but rarely spoke of him.\n\nLearning the truth of how her grandfather died as an adult left Hayes feeling frustrated \u2014 and angry.\n\n\u201cIt made me really disappointed in our judicial system and FBI and all the people who were supposed to protect us,\u201d Hayes told The Post. She argued the truth, which she hopes the grand jury transcripts could reveal, is more important than protecting the feelings of any descendants of guilty parties who might feel shame or embarrassment on behalf of their relatives.\n\n\u201cYou should not be able to enjoy that good reputation,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cDead or alive, good or bad, [the truth] needs to be known.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Clues to the 73-year-old cold case could rest in the sealed grand jury transcripts.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6QZNy-dQaOsaQALlMVk0vuC8Oyw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L6IADHEHBII6THLT4K5GXPY3TM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
