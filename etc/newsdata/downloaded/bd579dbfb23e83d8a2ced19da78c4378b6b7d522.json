The digital signs you see on Caltex bowsers while filling up the petrol tank, for example, are powered by Mandoe.\n\nIt is not known what Advent Partners is paying for its stake, although it is believed to be within the firm's usual shopping range. Advent Partners typically writes equity cheques worth up to $50 million.\n\nIt is understood Advent Partners is in the late stages of securing the deal.\n\nThe firm's investment is being led by dealmakers Brad Lynch, Mark Jago and Melissa Lok and would be the third acquisition in its Advent Partners 2 Fund. The other investments include SILK Laser and Compass Education.\n\nPwC Melbourne and Herbert Smith Freehills advised Advent, while PwC Sydney and MinterEllison advised the target, sources said.\n\nAdvent's equity injection is expected to seek to grow the business. The Mandoe platform is cloud-based and said to be highly-scalable. It is typically used for customer engagement or messaging - and is applicable to all sorts of industries.\n\nThe management team is said to be focused on growing into new markets and updating its software platform.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see where Mandoe ends up. It's something a bit different for Advent whose portfolio includes the aforementioned Compass and SILK, as well as independent craft beermaker Tribe Breweries, Frosty Boy Australia and outside school hours care operator Junior Adventure Group.\n\nIt has previously had success with the likes of GenesisCare, Integral Diagnostics and Gourmet Garden.", "description": "Quadrant Private Equity isn't the only Australian buyout firm with eyes on digital billboards.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4996%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_174/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1e8d2d65daf95392174079942a5c2af756c38922", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
