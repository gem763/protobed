Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, by not once mentioning Trump. The snub came despite the fact that Trump gave the order to go after al-Baghdadi, who led ISIS since 2014 and was responsible for most of the group\u2019s terrorist activities in the past few years.\n\nI congratulate our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals on delivering justice to the terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The world is better and safer without him in it. pic.twitter.com/miLSVWBT9l \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 27, 2019\n\nThe president confirmed on Sunday that al-Baghdadi was killed during a daring nighttime raid on a compound in northwestern Syria\u2019s Idlib Provence. The raid, which was led by a group of U.S. special forces, killed a \u201clarge number\u201d of ISIS forces, culminating in al-Baghdadi being cornered in a tunnel beneath the compound. Instead of being captured by the approaching U.S. forces, the ISIS leader detonated a suicide vest killing himself and three children.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward,\u201d Trump said when announcing the news. \u201cThe world is now a much safer place.\u201d\n\nNo U.S. troops were wounded in the operation, according to the president, except for \u201ca beautiful\u201d and \u201ctalented dog\u201d that was part of the canine unit brought along for the mission.\n\nBiden, in his own statement on Sunday seemed to agree with the president, even if he refused to mention him by name, when he said the \u201cworld is better and safer without\u201d al-Baghdadi. Biden\u2019s reluctance to congratulate the president for successfully taking out the ISIS leader stands in stark contrast to a message Trump sent to then-President Barack Obama upon the death of Osama bin Laden in May 2011.", "description": "Joe Biden snubbed Donald Trump when he congratulated U.S. forces on Sunday for killing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178402690-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
