The Judiciary Committee has already opened what its chairman, Representative Jerry Nadler of New York, has called an impeachment investigation, but until today, Pelosi has refused to describe it precisely that way. Her declaration today puts her full backing behind a process that could lead to the first effort to remove a president from office in more than two decades.\n\nStill, the speaker gave no timetable for when the House would decide whether to vote on articles of impeachment, which, if passed, would go to the Senate for a trial.\n\n\u201cThe president must be held accountable,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d\n\nEarlier this afternoon, in an interview with The Atlantic\u2019s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, Pelosi had strongly hinted this is the action she would take.\n\n\u201cIf we have to honor our oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have to do,\u201d Pelosi told Goldberg. \u201cBut we have to have the facts. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve said, soon as we have the facts, we\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nThen she added: \u201cNow we have the facts. We\u2019re ready \u2026 for later today.\u201d\n\nThe speaker was reluctant to announce an official impeachment probe before a series of meetings she planned to have with fellow Democrats at the Capitol this afternoon. But Pelosi signaled that she would join more than two-thirds of her caucus in backing an impeachment investigation that could lead to a formal effort to remove Trump from office.\n\nShe said that Trump was \u201cmaking lawlessness a virtue in our country,\u201d and accused the director of national intelligence of \u201cbreaking the law at the direction of the president\u201d by withholding a whistle-blower complaint that reportedly implicates Trump in asking the president of Ukraine to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s dealings in the country.\n\n\u201cIf that is the case\u2014that the president of the United States would ask a foreign government to assist him in a political way\u2014that would be wrong,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nWould it be impeachable?, Goldberg asked.\n\nPelosi would not answer directly. \u201cI\u2019ll be making an announcement at 5 p.m. today. Not here, not now,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the hours before Pelosi\u2019s appearance, support for impeachment among House Democrats surged to more than two-thirds of the caucus, including a key group of vulnerable freshman members and veteran leaders such as Representative John Lewis of Georgia, the civil-rights icon. \u201cWe cannot delay. We must not wait. Now is the time to act,\u201d Lewis said in a speech on the House floor earlier today.\n\nAll eyes were on Pelosi, who joked as she joined Goldberg onstage that she had been \u201cin hiding\u201d from reporters seeking to see if her position on impeachment had changed. During the interview, Trump tweeted from New York, where he was delivering a speech to the United Nations, that he would release a declassified, unredacted transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump has acknowledged that he pressed Zelensky to launch an investigation into the Biden family\u2019s \u201ccorruption\u201d and that he sought to withhold aid to Ukraine, but he has said that it was not a quid pro quo.", "description": "The speaker of the House announced the launch of a long-awaited formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump.", "authors": ["Russell Berman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/9_24_Main_Program_Ideas_Stage_0333/facebook.jpg?1569355926", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
