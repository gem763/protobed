While interviewing them, a woman identifying herself as a Collier County School system employee said the incident was posted on Instagram.\n\nThe deputy told the family that due to the nature of the crime and \"that the sole motivation was to strike 'Trump',\" investigators may follow up with them.\n\nThe Naples Haunted Gross House is an annual Halloween-themed event at the fairgrounds.\n\nFollow Stacey Henson on Twitter: @stacey_henson\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/28/florida-teen-charged-punching-man-dressed-donald-trump-face/2488880001/", "description": "A 14-year-old girl walked up to stranger dressed as President Trump as he waited in a line for haunted house and punched him as friends put on Instagram.", "authors": ["Stacey Henson", "Published P.M.
