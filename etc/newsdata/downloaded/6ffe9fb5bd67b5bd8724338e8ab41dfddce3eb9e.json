Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWide receiver Marvin Jones Jr. had six receptions for 101 yards and one touchdown as the Lions improved to 2-0-1.\n\nEagles quarterback Carson Wentz was 19 of 36 for 259 yards and two touchdowns to Nelson Agholor, but Philadelphia fell to 1-2.\n\nThe Eagles were hurt by seven dropped passes.\n\nThe Lions dominated much of the first half and took a 20-10 lead into the locker room.\n\nAfter Eagles kicker Jake Elliott kicked a 25-yard field goal on the game\u2019s opening drive, Detroit\u2019s Jamal Agnew returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for a 7-3 Lions lead 3:46 into the game. It was the first kickoff return for a touchdown allowed by the Eagles since 2013.\n\nRunning back Jordan Howard\u2019s first touchdown with the Eagles \u2014 a 1-yard run \u2014 gave them the lead back at 10-7 lead with 6:15 remaining in the first quarter.\n\nBut Detroit quickly reversed the momentum with a 13-play, 75-yard drive that carried into the second quarter and ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Kerryon Johnson for a 14-10 lead.\n\nAfter pulling ahead 17-10 on a Matt Prater 25-yard field goal, the Lions took advantage of a fumble by Agholor at the Detroit 40-yard line, returning it to the Eagles\u2019 22 and ultimately settling for a Prater 33-yard field goal and 10-point lead at halftime.\n\nAgholor redeemed himself somewhat with a dazzling 20-yard touchdown catch in which he spun off a defensive player and found the end zone to get the Eagles within 20-17 with 4:15 left in the third.\n\nThe Lions responded on their next drive and took a 27-17 advantage when Jones Jr. hauled in a 12-yard catch from Stafford on the first play of the fourth quarter. They moved 75 yards in nine plays, taking 4:22 off the clock.\n\nAgholor\u2019s second touchdown reception, this time from 2 yards, closed the gap to 27-24 with 6:59 remaining.\n\nThe Eagles had one last chance to win when Malcolm Jenkins blocked a 46-yard field goal attempt by Prater just inside the two-minute warning. Wentz connected with running back Darren Sproles on fourth-and-5 for a 25-yard strike to get to the Lions\u2019 20, but Sproles was called for pass interference to negate the play.\n\nOn fourth-and-15, rookie JJ Arcega-Whiteside dropped a long pass inside the Detroit 5, allowing the Lions to run out the clock.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Quarterback Matthew Stafford completed 18 of 32 passes for 201 yards and one touchdown and the visiting Detroit Lions remained unbeaten with a 27-24 victory against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432730007&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0UK-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
