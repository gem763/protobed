Standards, expectations high for new US women's coach", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nCongratulations, Vlatko Andonovski. Don\u2019t screw it up.\n\nThe longtime National Women's Soccer League coach now has what is arguably the toughest job in sports \u2013 at least until Bill Belichick retires. Introduced Monday as the new head coach of the U.S. women\u2019s team, all Andonovski has to do is follow Jill Ellis, who won two World Cup titles and more games than anyone else in the program\u2019s history.\n\nBefore Ellis, Pia Sundhage led the Americans to Olympic gold medals in 2008 and 2012, and a spot in the 2011 World Cup final. Tony DiCicco won World Cup and Olympic titles. Getting the picture?\n\n\u201cWhat this team has done, and what Jill has done, I think is absolutely amazing,\u201d Andonovski said Monday at a news conference in New York. \u201cJill was hired to win one World Cup and she won two. It just pushes the standards even higher and made the whole job even more stressful.\n\n\u201cBut for me, I was very well aware of it.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. players often talk about the culture of their team, and how it\u2019s impressed upon them from their first youth team call-up. This is a program that has produced Michelle Akers, Mia Hamm, Abby Wambach, Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, and has set the standard for the game globally for almost four decades now.\n\nWhile the players are responsible for maintaining the culture, the coach has a role, too. It will be Andonovski who will have to manage the egos and minutes of his players, all of whom would be both starters and stars on any other team in the world. It will be Andonovski who will have to find a style of play that best suits and maximizes the talent of his players.\n\nAnd it will be Andonovski who will have to figure out how to keep the rest of the world at bay.\n\nIf there was anything to be taken from the World Cup, it was that the level of play around the world has improved faster than possibly anyone expected. Other countries are pumping resources into their women\u2019s program and/or domestic leagues, and the gap between the Americans and everyone else will continue to narrow.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say change, I would say evolve. The game is evolving from World Cup to World Cup, but also from year to year,\u201d Andonovski said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t follow those trends, all the other national teams are going to catch up to us.\n\n\u201cAlso, I don\u2019t want to follow some of the trends \u2026 we want to be leaders in some of the trends.\u201d\n\nVlatko Andonovski, 43, hasn't coached at the international level before.

But the NWSL has made that less of a factor.\n\nBorn in North Macedonia, he played in Europe before coming to the United States in 2000 to play indoor soccer. He has coached in the NWSL since its inception, leading FC Kansas City to titles in 2014 and 2015. He has coached Seattle\u2019s Reign FC the past two seasons, and this year was named NWSL\u2019s coach of the year.\n\n\u201c(His teams) liked to have the ball, they\u2019re very sound defensively and they like to attack creatively,\u201d said Kate Markgraf, the general manager of the U.S. women\u2019s team who headed up the coaching search.\n\nMore importantly, Andonovski knows the players he will be coaching as well as those his teams will be facing. Asked how he will handle the tough decisions, particularly those that will have to be made as some of the U.S. team\u2019s biggest stars get older, Andonovski said his management style has always been to be honest, direct and concise.\n\nCurrent members of the national team reportedly lobbied for his hiring, and it was telling that in the moments after he was hired, U.S. Soccer posted quotes praising him from Rapinoe and Allie Long, who played for him in Seattle, as well as Becky Sauerbrunn, who played for Andonovski in Kansas City. His hiring was approved unanimously.\n\nThis is no easy transition w the Olympic qualifiers just months away, but I like that Vlatko Andonovski, the new USWNT coach, comes into the job well loved by players for his knowledge of game & also his ability to manage people. That is huge. #USWNT \u2014 Julie Foudy (@JulieFoudy) October 28, 2019\n\n\u201cHe is everything you\u2019d want in a head coach,\u201d U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a more perfect match for this team, at this time.\u201d\n\nAndonovski will have to be. The Tokyo Olympics begin in nine months, and there is no grace period given to new coaches.\n\n\u201cI knew coming into it, it is extremely important to win all of the tournaments,\u201d he said.\n\nIn any other job, that would be hyperbole. In Andonovski's new job, it's the standard.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "description": "Vlatko Andonovski has coached in NWSL since its inception, winning two titles with FC Kansas City and coach of year honors this season with Reign FC.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published P.M.
