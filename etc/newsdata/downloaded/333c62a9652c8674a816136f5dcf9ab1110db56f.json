Cramer told his viewers that it isn't trade talks or the Federal Reserve, it's demand. The companies that have demand are in demand, and those that don't, don't. Housing was in demand as it accounts for 15% of our economy, Cramer said. And when you add in all the ancillary businesses, including retail and payment processors such as Visa Inc. (V) , housing counts for a lot more than it appears. Let's check out the charts and indicators of V to see if the fundamentals and the trends line up.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of V, below, we can see after an uptrend earlier this year that prices have moved sideways the past five months. Dips into the $170-$165 area have been bought while rallies to the $185 area found profit takers. V crossed above and below the 50-day moving average several times during this consolidation pattern but it is currently above the line and it has a positive slope. The slower-to-react 200-day moving average line has a positive slope and intersects down around $165.\n\nThe trading volume looks like it has increased this month and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has turned upward, telling us that buyers of V have turned more aggressive. The OBV line is close to making a new high and its breakout could precede pricing breaking out -- not that uncommon. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is right on the zero line and could cross to the upside very soon for an outright go long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of V, below, we can see a bullish picture. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line, which has done a great job identifying the uptrend over the past three years. The weekly OBV line shows a matching uptrend and confirms and support the rally. The weekly MACD oscillator has been above the zero line for nearly the entire time, and while it is in a take profits sell mode the two moving averages that make up this indicator are narrowing and could cross to a new buy signal before long.\n\nIn this weekly Point and Figure chart of V, below, we can see that the software is projecting an upside price target of $206.\n\nBottom line strategy: The weekly uptrend in V is long and strong and with a potential upside price target of $206 we want to be buyers of V, risking a close below $170.", "description": "Visa Inc.'s (V) technical charts indicate the stock is where you want to be, as the weekly uptrend in shares of the payments processor is long and strong and points to higher prices....V", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Visa'S Charts Indicate It'S Where You Want To Be", "The Weekly Uptrend In Shares Of The Payments Processor Is Long", "Strong", "Points To Higher Prices.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Carolyn Boroden", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Bob Lang", "Gary Berman"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/08eb1620-3127-11e8-9b34-b9188a31b524.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
