Mueller III under oath in 2017. Lewandowski said then that Trump had instructed him twice to tell Sessions, then the attorney general, to curtail Mueller\u2019s investigation of Trump, and Lewandowski failed to do so, perhaps saving Trump from an overt act of obstructing justice.\n\nSo how to square the two conflicting statements? During testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Lewandowski said something that sparked an audible reaction from onlookers in the hearing room: \u201cI have no obligation to be honest with the media because they\u2019re just as dishonest as anyone else.\u201d\n\nBasically he conceded that you can\u2019t take his word for it.\n\nDuring a combative interview on CNN on Wednesday morning, Lewandowski expanded upon his situational truthfulness, saying, \u201cI\u2019m as honest as I can be, as often as I can be.\u201d\n\nGiven his admission on Tuesday, that should have raised another question: Was he being honest about that?\n\nCNN employed Lewandowski as an on-air commentator between April 2017 and June 2018, during which he repeatedly spoke on behalf of Trump and his administration\u2019s policies. CNN did not respond to a request for comment about Lewandowski on Wednesday.\n\nDespite widespread cynicism about honesty in Washington, Eric Schultz, a former spokesman for President Barack Obama, said Lewandowski\u2019s admission is one of a kind. \u201cTo be fair, I don\u2019t know a single other Democratic or Republican spokesperson who thinks this way,\u201d Schultz tweeted. \u201cWe all work hard to make our best case, but I\u2019ve never worked with (or against) anyone on either side of the aisle who thinks lying is okay.\u201d\n\nJournalists know their sources sometimes hedge their answers or spin for advantage. They also suspect that a few outright lie (an old saw in the reporting game: \u201cIf your mother says she loves you, check it out\u201d).\n\nAs president, Trump has made more than 12,000 suspect statements, according to The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker. Aides such as Kellyanne (\u201calternative facts\u201d) Conway and former press secretaries Sean Spicer and Sarah Sanders have made plainly inaccurate or false statements in their dealings with the press.\n\nBut it\u2019s rare for anyone closely associated with Trump to correct the record or admit fault in speaking to the news media. And it\u2019s unheard of for them to admit that they lied.\n\nUntil Lewandowski.\n\nThe admission raises questions about how reporters should cover him in the future, especially if, as expected, he declares his candidacy for a U.S. Senate seat in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cI fail to see the value in interviewing Lewandowski in any capacity as commentator or Trump proxy,\u201d said Gabriel Kahn, a professor at the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, on Wednesday. \u201cHow would any news organization properly contextualize that for the audience? \u2018We\u2019re about to hear from someone who quite possibly is not telling the truth, but let\u2019s hear what he has to say anyway\u2019?\n\n\u201cAny news organization that puts him live on camera now, no matter what the chyron [or on-screen graphic] reads, does so for showmanship, not to further public understanding,\u201d Kahn said.\n\nHe described Lewandowski\u2019s bad faith as part of a bigger strategy. It\u2019s \u201cdeliberate and calculated and part of a long-running campaign by the Trump movement to discredit news media so as to allow the administration to act without accountability.\u201d\n\nLying to the media isn\u2019t a crime, but lying under oath is. Several figures who were involved in Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, including George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn and Rick Gates, have been indicted or convicted of lying to federal authorities.\n\nIn his testimony on Tuesday, Lewandowski said he tells the truth while under oath. Asked by CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on Wednesday if that is the only circumstance in which he feels obligated to be honest, Lewandowski deflected, invoking former FBI director Andrew McCabe, now a CNN contributor. McCabe was fired last year just before he was set to retire after the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general found that he made an unauthorized disclosure to the media, then lied to investigators about it.\n\n\u201cYou and your network continue to use him as a contributor who has been lying under oath,\u201d Lewandowski said of McCabe, who authorized the initial investigation into Trump\u2019s ties to Russia in 2016. \u201cSo if you\u2019re going to hold me to a standard, hold your same employees and contributors to that same standard.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Lewandowski declined to admit that he lies in news interviews, despite telling the House committee that on Tuesday.", "description": "Former Trump campaign manager, caught in a lie, says dishonesty with the press is fine.", "authors": ["Paul Farhi", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/22KK3JG2GEI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
