Science Photographer of the Year shortlist 1/9 Soap bubble structures showing light interference colours and patterning Bubbles want to optimise space and minimise their surface area for a given volume of air. This unique phenomenon makes them a reliable, useful tool in many areas of research. In particular, materials science and 'packing' - how things fit together. Bubble walls drain under gravity, thin at the top, thick at the bottom and interferes with travelling lightwaves to create bands of colour. Black spots show the wall is too thin for interference colours, indicating the bubble is about to burst! - Kym Cox Kym Cox/RPS 2/9 Upside down Jelly fish, Cassiopea xamachana Instead of swimming, this species spends its time pulsing up and down in the water. Their diet is sea plankton and their coloration comes from the uptake of algae in the water. Some jellyfish species have been documented eating plastics in the ocean. One theory suggests that algae grows on the plastic. As it breaks down, the algae creates the odor of dimethyl sulfide that attracts hungry animals. - Mary Anne Chilton Mary Anne Chilton/RPS 3/9 Tribolium confusum. Confused flour beetle.

The remarkable shape of the nebula resembles that of the continent of North America, complete with a prominent Gulf of Mexico. The Cygnus Wall, a term for the \"Mexico and Central America part\" of the North America Nebula, exhibits the most concentrated star formations in the nebula. - Dave Watson Dave Watson/RPS 5/9 Safety Corona A safety pin is connected to a high tension AC generator. The pin ionizes the air around it. When the electrons fall back on an atom, the excess energy is emitted as a photon, which generate the corona glow around the pin. The fuzziness of the pin is because the camera did not actually capture light reflected on the pin but rather the light emitted by the ionized light around it. - Richard Germain Richard Germain/RPS 6/9 Calmness of Eternity Himalayas mountains, Nepal.

The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye.

Here, I wanted to take a series of closer, more detailed and more honest shots than we often see. Exploring the multitude of shapes and exposing the wear of the telescope, each photo in the series stands alone or can be viewed collectively, either way, they present a powerful portrayal of machine that helps humankind in their endeavours to understand space and time. - Marge Bradshaw Marge Bradshaw/RPS 1/9 Soap bubble structures showing light interference colours and patterning Bubbles want to optimise space and minimise their surface area for a given volume of air.

Only three women have ever been awarded the physics prize, the equivalent of one every 60 years.\n\nIt is the second Nobel Prize winner to be revealed this year, after British scientist Sir Peter Ratcliffe and US scientists William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n\nThe trio of scientists were awarded for their discoveries of \u201chow cells sense and adapt to oxygen and availability\u201d, which is one of the most fundamental processes for sustaining human life.\n\nWinners of the Nobel Prizes for Chemistry, Literature, Peace and Economic Sciences are set to be announced over the next seven days.\n\nGreta Thunberg is one of the favourites for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, which will be unveiled on Friday. The teen activist has gained international recognition for campaigning against climate change.\n\nMore to follow", "description": "The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics has been won by\u00a0James Peebles, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz.
