It affected my relationship with my husband, with friends. It really was rock bottom of my entire career.\u201d\n\nBetween an ankle injury in 2017 and coming off the bench for the national team in 2019, Lloyd said, she believed she \u201cdeserved\u201d to be on the field throughout the entire World Cup.\n\n\u201cThere's no denying it,\u201d she said. \u201cI deserved to be on that field that whole World Cup, but I wasn't. And I think I've grown as a person, as a player. It sucked. It absolutely sucked.\u201d\n\nCANADA BEATS US 2-0, ENDS 34-YEAR, 17-GAME WINLESS STREAK\n\nLloyd, 37, said she would like to play for the Olympic team in Tokyo next year.
