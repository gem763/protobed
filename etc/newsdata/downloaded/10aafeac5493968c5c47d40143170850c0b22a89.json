It will now be on hold while legal challenges against it proceed.\n\n191008203705967\n\nJudge George Daniels of the Southern District of New York, issued a nationwide block of the rule, writing that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and would suffer \"irreparable harm\" if the rule were to go into effect. He wrote the government had failed to demonstrate why the current approach was inadequate.\n\n\"It is repugnant to the American Dream of the opportunity for prosperity and success through hard work and upward mobility,\" Daniels wrote.\n\nKen Cuccinelli, the acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, expressed confidence that the administration would eventually prevail and framed the policy as a legal attempt to ensure that those who settle in the United States can support themselves financially and not be a drain on public benefits.\n\n\"The public charge standard was never intended to exclude working class immigrants from developing countries,\" said Charles Wheeler, a lawyer with the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, which is a plaintiff in the case. \"This ruling confirms that the American dream remains open to them.\"", "description": "Ruling temporarily blocks Trump administration rule that would deny green cards to immigrants on public aid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/8/8/a6a586b9cebe41a8b95a6f98bb8d7fdb_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
