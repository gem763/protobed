If they want to delete the lap, then delete the lap\u2026..\u201d\n\nThe stewards said Verstappen had \u201cadmitted that he was aware that car 77 (Bottas) crashed and did see the car on the left hand side of the track, but was not aware of the waved yellow flag.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe admitted not reducing his speed in the yellow sector,\u201d the stewards added.\n\n\u2013 \u2018I had to risk it\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cTaking into account all the available evidence and the statement from the driver the stewards impose a drop of three grid positions and two penalty points.\u201d\n\nRed Bull boss Christian Horner said it was \u201ca great shame\u201d that the flamboyant Verstappen had been penalised.\n\n\u201cMax put in a phenomenal performance throughout qualifying. He was quickest in Q1, second quickest in Q2 and quickest in Q3 to achieve his second pole position of the season,\u201d said Horner.\n\n\u201cIt is a great shame that Max has lost pole position.\u201d\n\nVerstappen\u2019s demotion and Bottas\u2019s crash boosted Hamilton\u2019s hopes of clinching his sixth drivers\u2019 world title in Sunday\u2019s race by outscoring his Mercedes team-mate by 14 points.\n\n\u201cI knew that I had to risk it in the last run to gain positions, so I tried to squeeze everything out of the car,\u201d said Bottas.\n\n\u201cThe lap was good until the last corner where I went a bit wide on the exit on the dusty part of the track and that\u2019s where I lost it and hit the wall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all okay, but I\u2019ve unfortunately given the boys in the garage some extra work to do tonight. Hopefully we can avoid taking any penalties for tomorrow. It\u2019s annoying because looking at the times, I think I had a chance at qualifying third.\u201d\n\nMercedes team chief Toto Wolff said he feared for the implications of the crash in Sunday\u2019s shake-up.\n\n\u201cThe car took a bit of a beating,\u201d said Woolf.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re assessing the damage at the moment and hope that we don\u2019t have to change any parts that would result in a grid penalty.\u201d\n\nHamilton had earlier admitted he thought third place on the grid was possible before Bottas\u2019s accident.\n\n\u201cThe last sector went to pot (when it was controlled by double yellow flags) so that was it,\u201d said the five-time champion.\n\n\u201cGenerally, I was quite happy with today. I knew it would be difficult, but I have a fighting position and I am going to give it everything.\u201d", "description": "Mexico City (AFP) \u2013 Max Verstappen was given a three-place grid penalty and stripped of pole position at the Mexican Grand Prix late Saturday after", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/9e76b2_valtteri-bottas-walking-his-accident-verstappen-stripped-mexico-pole-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
