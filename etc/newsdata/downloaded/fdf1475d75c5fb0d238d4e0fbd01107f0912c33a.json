It's listed there as a best-selling offering.\n\nOffering the book free as a Word document is tempting bait, according to Malwarebytes. Typical malware hooks involve such things as fake invoices or fake delivery notices, Malwarebytes\u2019 William Tsing told Fox News.\n\n\u201cHowever, using something like Snowden's book is an interesting approach because many people will be curious to view it, especially if delivered straight into their inbox,\u201d Tsing said.\n\nROBOCALL 'HIJACKING' IS ON THE RISE, REPORT WARNS\n\nEmotet is dangerous. \u201cEmotet is behind the largest spam campaign we track due to the size and diversity of its botnet,\u201d Tsing said, referring to a network of computers that send spam.\n\n\u201cIts payload is used as an entry point into systems for additional and more destructive malware specifically targeting organizations that may be held for ransom,\u201d Tsing added.\n\nWhen a bogus document is opened, a fake message that \u201cWord hasn\u2019t been activated\u201d is displayed. Then you are prompted to enable the content. Once you do this, nothing appears to happen. \"However, what users don\u2019t see is the malicious macro code that will execute once they click on the button,\" according to Malwarebytes.\n\nCHINESE CYBER HACKERS HAVE BUILT A BACKDOOR IN US-CHINA TRADE WAR, SAYS REPORT\n\nAn English-language sample of the spam \u201choneypot\u201d email is more convincing than the garden variety, broken-English spam.\n\n\u201cFirst, they spy on us, then they persecute whistleblowers, now they ban books. Freedom? Time to organize collective reading of Snowden book everywhere. \u2026 The book is in the attachment\u201d \u2013 said one bogus email.\n\nThe malicious email templates are in several different languages in order to target different geographic zones, Tsing said.\n\nHOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM RANSOMWARE USING WINDOWS 10\n\nAlways be wary of email containing links, Tsing says.\n\n\u201cAlways beware of emails containing attachments or links even if they appear to be from a friend or colleague,\u201d according to Tsing. This is especially true if you\u2019re a business with a network. Tsing says businesses need to \u201cprotect endpoints from being compromised and possibly infecting the rest of your network.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSnowden\u2019s book continues to generate a lot of interest. On Sept. 17 the day the book was published, the Department of Justice filed a civil lawsuit against Snowden, alleging he had violated nondisclosure agreements signed with the government.", "description": "A pernicious strain of malware has reemerged that claims to offer Edward Snowden\u2019s just-released book as a hook to lure in unsuspecting victims.", "authors": ["Brooke Crothers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/EdwardSnowdenBook2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
