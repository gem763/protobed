No, It\u2019s Not! How Experts See Different Things in the Data", "language": "en", "text": "Is the \u2018best we can get\u2019 good enough?\n\nEven observational trials are hard to do well. Most major health setbacks are pretty rare. It\u2019s hard to see big differences in death, cancer and heart attacks in even large groups of people, unless you follow them over long periods. But quantifying what people are eating over long periods is challenging, too, because often people don\u2019t remember.\n\nSuch studies are also difficult to interpret because of what are called confounding factors. Maybe people who eat more meat are poorer. Maybe they smoke, drink too much alcohol or don\u2019t exercise. Those things would also lead to bad outcomes, and it\u2019s hard to tease out individual components over time.\n\nIf you do trials of people at higher risk \u2014 those who have already had heart attacks, for example \u2014 it\u2019s easier to see if changes matter. The Predimed trial, for instance, which studied the Mediterranean diet, focused on people who already had diabetes or a number of traits placing them at high risk for heart disease. But these people aren\u2019t necessarily representative of the general public, for whom dietary recommendations are written.\n\nAll of this means that observational evidence, which is easier to obtain, will be ruled as \u201clow quality\u201d by some researchers. Others will argue it\u2019s the best we can get, and therefore we should apply different standards to such research.\n\nShould we care about signals like blood pressure, or only major events like heart attacks?\n\nBecause big outcomes are rare, research sometimes looks at intermediate measures. Those, like weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and more, can change in shorter periods. Some will point to studies in these domains and say that they prove that meat reduction has significant health effects. High blood pressure or cholesterol levels are widely believed to be major risk factors for adverse events. Others will disagree as to how much we should rely on intermediate measures. These new studies focused only on those end-stage outcomes.\n\nIf experts are uncertain, should they recommend anything?\n\nCritics of the new meat studies argue that given the authors\u2019 low certainty about their findings, they should have issued no recommendations at all. That\u2019s not unreasonable. When the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force lacks sufficient evidence to publish recommendations on prevention, it gives recommendations an \u201cI\u201d rating, and says the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms. That\u2019s all. Maybe that was preferable here, instead of publishing recommendations that people continue their current meat consumption.\n\nShould we look at the individual, or the population?\n\nEven in studies that find statistically significant effects, the absolute benefits in most studies are small. I\u2019ve written about this before. Many will argue, however, that even if there is a small individual benefit, the benefits to the population can be large.", "description": "As the latest controversy over new research illustrates, nutrition science can be open to interpretation.", "authors": ["Aaron E.
