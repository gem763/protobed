The prosecutors claim that he used illegally accessed virtual machines to mine cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nOver $5 million worth of computing power\n\nPer the indictment, the total worth of computing services used by Ho amounted to over $5 million. The prosecutors also allege that at some point he even became the largest AWS data consumer, adding:\n\n\"In the few months his scheme remained active, Ho consumed more than $5 million in unpaid cloud computing services with his mining operation and, for a brief period, was one of Amazon Web Services (AWS) largest consumers of data usage by volume. Some of the bills were paid by the California game developer\u2019s financial staff before the fraud was detected.\"\n\nThe prosecutors claim that Ho also stole identities from a man in Texas and an Indian business owner, likewise using them to reserve virtual machines on AWS and Google Cloud.\n\nPolice arrested Ho in late September. When the case goes to trial, he could face charges in the Seattle Western District court if extradited \u2014 which is possible thanks to an extradition treaty between the U.S. and Singapore.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Oct. 3, cryptocurrency exchange HitBTC has denied allegations that it froze Brazillian investment startup Atlas Quantum\u2019s funds, claiming the evidence was forged.", "description": "The United States prosecutors officially indict a man from Singapore for stealing Amazon Web Services\u2019 cloud computing power to mine cryptocurrencies", "authors": ["Liam Frost"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOWZkZGUzOGVhYjY0OTY0ZGU0YzEyZGU5ZDQ4ODZhYzEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
