I would pay any amount \u2014 millions \u2014 to get that dog back,' she added.\n\nResidents in New York City's Upper West Side say they're living in fear of a Siberian husky named Charlie (pictured) who has attacked multiple other canines in Central Park\n\nBailey and her little pup, Belle, were playing fetch in the park when Charlie approached and attacked.\n\n'You go to the park for a walk and you come home with a box,' Bailey mournfully stated.\n\nShe told the New York Post that losing Belle has been 'an emotional nightmare', which has prompted her to relocate to Los Angeles.\n\n'New York just wasn't the same without [Belle],' she explained.\n\nMeanwhile, the killer canine was responsible for another attack in Central Park, which took place on August 12.\n\nElizabeth Graham told The New York Post that her miniature dachshund, Lulu, was bitten by Charlie near the park's 97th Street entrance.\n\nThe pup suffered a punctured spleen which had to be removed by a veterinarian.\n\nDachshund Lulu was bitten near the entrance to Central Park's 97th Street entrance on the ritzy Upper West Side\n\n'She had a tube in her neck for oxygen, the flesh was twisted, she was very black and blue and she had staples in her stomach, It's a miracle she's still alive, Graham stated.\n\nMedical bills topped $25,000, and Charlie's owner insisted he would cover the costs.\n\nHowever, Graham claims she has only received $2,925 from the owner of the husky - an Upper West Side resident named Matthew Stock.\n\nStock says he is the victim of a 'smear campaign' and is being treated like a 'villain' in his moneyed neighborhood.\n\nCharlie (pictured) is two years old and has killed 'several raccoons' as well as beloved chihuahua Belle\n\nCharlie's owner Matthew Stock (right) says he is the victim of a 'smear campaign' and is being treated like a 'villain' in his moneyed neighborhood\n\n'It's harassment,' he bluntly told the newspaper on Saturday\n\n'I feel terrible about what happened [with chihuahua Belle and dachshund Lulu] \u2026 but this is just too far. Charlie's not a command killer dog.'\n\nStock also disputes claims he walks his husky unleashed, insisting Charlie has been restrained after he mauled Belle and killed 'several raccoons'.\n\nHowever, that hasn't stopped other fearful locals from erecting posters warning other dog owners to be cautious of the killer husky.\n\nGraham is now concerned that - after an attack on her pup Lulu - Charlie may now bite children.\n\n'If in one second he was able to do this to Lulu, can you imagine what he could do to a child?' she asked.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene sent Stock a stipulation this week ordering to keep his husky on a leash and muzzle at all times.\n\nStock says he will cooperate with the demands.", "description": "The predatory pooch, a two-year-old named Charlie, mauled a chihuahua to death  last August, before critically injuring a Dachshund two months ago.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/03/19348706-0-image-a-19_1570328280685.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
