When one looks at the current challenges in South Africa, we have to confront the reality that as a nation, we may be closer to genocide than we are willing to admit.\n\nREAD | A crime that cost more than 50 million people their lives\n\nThe sad part of the Rwandan genocide experience is that people who used to peacefully exist alongside each other began to embrace their differences, told in the language of who the rightful native and settler native are.\n\nCulture and practices were then highlighted as features that distinguish each other, and such differences were then highlighted as a source of a conflicting value system that could not be resolved.\n\nSource of conflict\n\nOf course, when nations or groups begin to appeal to nationhood as a source of difference, someone's sense of being will then be castigated as a source of conflict in society.\n\nThe solution that is often suggested involves the removal or elimination of an alien nation. The source of conflict in this situation is always a struggle for resources; economic resources.\n\nHowever, the conflict express itself as a selector of who has a right to exist and earn and living, and who has no such rights. Eventually, those who feel victimised by an unjust system which has condemned them to economic desperation, tend to victimise others as perpetrators of the system.\n\nREAD | Melanie Verwoerd: We are losing our soul\n\nWhether we call it xenophobia or criminality, the truth is that the sentiments that drive such reactions by those who feel they are the natives of the land, are the same sentiments that drove the genocide in Rwanda; the genocide in Bosnia, and in other countries.\n\nThe underlying feature of this horrid social phenomenon is always the same: Victims become killers. Mamdani's book is a warning about how others are firstly defined as culprits of the moral decay, and they are subsequently made into deserving victims.\n\nEven worse is that the state and its institutions in such circumstances often play a distance role whilst the broader population carries out systematic removal of the identified culprits. As Mamdani said, in the case of Rwanda, he faced the reality of a criminal population hiding behind economic frustration.\n\nIn this short piece, South Africans need to avoid becoming a criminal population. History will judge us badly for having made victims out of equally desperate people who made it to our shores.\n\nREAD | SA is a dysfunctional, broken and collapsing society\n\nThis is not about the state, it's rather about the population ensuring that it does not become a criminal population. We are becoming a criminal population and once we are done victimising others, we will go ahead and find new victims amongst ourselves.\n\nThe sentiments that drive xenophobia never stop unless deliberate efforts are made to change the views of the nation. New victims will be searched. The question is, once this phase is completed, who is next in line to take responsibility for social ills in the country?\n\n- Ralph Mathekga is a political analyst and the author of When Zuma Goes and Ramaphosa's Turn.\n\nDisclaimer: News24 encourages freedom of speech and the expression of diverse views.
