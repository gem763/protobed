With ancestors dating back to the Jurassic era, some of the trees that now grow along California\u2019s Sierra Nevada Mountains been alive for thousands of years, bearing witness to most of human history \u2013 from the fall of the Roman empire to the rise of Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nBut a couple hundred years of human encroachment on to the sequoias\u2019 habitat, combined with the climate crisis, increasingly intense wildfires, and drought have threatened the species\u2019 future. The last of the world\u2019s most massive trees now live on just 73 groves scattered across the Sierras. Most lie within protected national parks such as Sequoia national park, where visitors flock from around the world to marvel at General Sherman, the world\u2019s most massive tree.\n\nWhat is 'forest bathing' \u2013 and can it make your healthier?

Now, in an ambitious bid to secure a future for them, a conservation group has struck an unusual deal to acquire the last, largest privately owned sequoia grove.\n\nThe deal is the result of two decades of discussions between the not-for-profit conservation group Save the Redwoods and the Rouch family, which has owned the 530-acre Alder Creek grove since before the second world war. The forest is home to hundreds of sequoias, including the Stagg Tree which \u2013 at more than 240ft tall and 100ft around \u2013 is the fifth-largest in the world.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A conservation group has struck an unusual deal to acquire the last, largest privately owned sequoia grove.

Once they acquire the land, the group plans to work with ecologists to help the forest build resilience against global heating and its catastrophic consequences,\n\n\u201cThe forest is truly ancient,\u201d said Sam Hodder, the president of Save the Redwoods. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve now got this extraordinary, unique opportunity to restore and protect it.\u201d\n\nAlthough sequoias have evolved to withstand temperature changes, extreme heat and fire, drought and destructive wildfires are now proving to be the biggest threats to their survival.\n\nCuriously, decades of humans fighting fires has made the problem worse.\n\n\u201cGiant sequoias really need wildfire,\u201d explained Kristen Shive, a forest ecologist with Save the Redwoods. Their cones are cued up to open with the heat of a fire, releasing seeds that like to germinate in freshly burned, fertile forest floor.\n\nFor millions of years, \u201csequoias adapted to survive and thrive with regular, low-level fires\u201d, Shive says. With their thick barks and high crowns, most mature giant sequoias are immune to fires that burn though almost everything else around them. \u201cBut over the past century, we moved in, and started stopping fires everywhere.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Most giant sequoias lie within protected national parks.

Smaller trees serve as \u201cladders\u201d, allowing the fires to climb up to the sequoia\u2019s crowns and kill them.\n\nClimate change hasn\u2019t helped. Intense heat waves and drawn-out periods of drought have left California\u2019s forests drier, and more prone to wildfires.\n\nDroughts also depleted giant sequoias, weakening them and leaving them vulnerable to bark beetles that chomp through their bark and spread a fungus that can kill them. Healthy trees are usually able to fight off a beetle attack \u2013 but dehydrated trees are defenseless. \u201cThere\u2019s a handful of giant sequoia trees that died in the recent drought,\u201d said Anthony Ambrose, a plant ecologist at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\u201cRestoring these lands and stewarding these groves is going to be a big job,\u201d Ambrose said. \u201cIt takes a lot of money to take care of these lands.\u201d\n\nSave the Redwoods plans to make that investment in the coming years, as well as install trails and roads \u201cin a way that is mindful of the ecological sensitivity\u201d, said the CEO Hodder, before eventually transferring the land to National Parks. \u201cOnce it\u2019s ready, we really do want to give the public access to this area,\u201d Hodder said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s remarkable \u2013 the cinnamon bark, the incredible shades of green in the alpine meadows, that unique Sierra blue sky.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The last of the world\u2019s most massive trees now live on just 73 groves scattered across the Sierras.

And the other thing is you just have to look at them. They\u2019re so beautiful, and you realize once they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.\u201d", "description": "A conservation group plans to buy the largest privately owned sequoia grove as the climate crisis threatens the species\u2019 future", "authors": ["Maanvi Singh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99e67ec058cc8033451c159ff686af748ecace19/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=97de772206fb719bde57b7a80abee841", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
