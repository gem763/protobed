Researchers looked at whether people are more likely to continue using tobacco products if their first experience with them is with something that\u2019s flavored. As many might reasonably guess, their analysis shows that people who are introduced to tobacco via flavored stuff are more likely to have continued using tobacco later on, and with more frequency.\n\nResearchers analyzed the data by breaking self-reported responses from a nationally representative survey on tobacco use into two waves: one from September 2013\u2013December 2014; the second from October 2014\u2013October 2015. Across the board, if a person\u2019s first tobacco experience involved something flavored (whether it be a menthol cigarette, hookah, or an e-cig), they were more likely to report continued tobacco use later on.\n\nFlavors were particularly attractive to people between age 12\u201325: Researchers found they were more likely to be initially drawn to flavored products than older adults. People seemed to be less drawn to flavored tobacco as they got older. The study also showed that people who started out with flavored e-cigs weren\u2019t just likely to keep using them, but upped their frequency as they got older.\n\nNone of this is particularly surprising. In the study discussion, researchers even note that their findings are in line with what tobacco companies have known: Flavors are not only attractive to people who\u2019ve never used regular tobacco products, but they\u2019re also more likely to get people hooked. Notably, this study predates the JUUL Age (JUUL became the most popular vape product in late 2017) and what the CDC started referring to as a youth \u201cepidemic\u201d earlier this year, when data showed more than one in four high schoolers reported using vaping products in the past 30 days.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Hannah Smothers on Twitter.", "description": "A new study leaves little room for doubt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db06c6e62af2e008dc83d1c/lede/1571843443304-GettyImages-912992688.jpeg?crop=0.7877xw:0.6629xh;0.1745xw,0.3371xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
