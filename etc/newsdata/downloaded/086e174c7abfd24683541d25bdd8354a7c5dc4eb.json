We call out journalists for bias and fake news all the time on this site, but suggested they be hanged is a bit much.\n\nHowever, what happens when a man wearing such a shirt boards an airplane and other passengers feel threatened? It\u2019s just a T-shirt, obviously, but on Friday there was quite a back and forth over what United should have done.\n\nMy brother is on a @united flight from LA to Boston and saw this guy boarding with a shirt that reads \u201cRope. Tree. Journalist. Some assembly required.\u201d #thread pic.twitter.com/MWy5HnDxzI \u2014 Jessica Sidman (@jsidman) October 11, 2019\n\nHe told the flight attendant and she asked what he wanted her to do. \u2014 Jessica Sidman (@jsidman) October 11, 2019\n\nHe told her he didn\u2019t want one passenger threatening to kill other passengers. \u2014 Jessica Sidman (@jsidman) October 11, 2019\n\nHe told her @United should do the right thing. She went to talk to the captain. \u2014 Jessica Sidman (@jsidman) October 11, 2019\n\nThen security pulled my brother off the plane. He talked to a security official. \u2014 Jessica Sidman (@jsidman) October 11, 2019\n\nThe security guy said they couldn\u2019t do anything just because it was offensive. \u2014 Jessica Sidman (@jsidman) October 11, 2019\n\nMy brother said it wasn\u2019t offensive, it was THREATENING. \u2014 Jessica Sidman (@jsidman) October 11, 2019\n\nThey offered to put my brother on another flight. They didnt say anything to the guy with the shirt. \u2014 Jessica Sidman (@jsidman) October 11, 2019\n\nWe know that prima donna journalists like Jim Acosta consider their lives in danger at Trump rallies whenever the president starts in about fake news being the enemy of the people, but was this an overreaction? What should United have done?\n\nIt's a stupid shirt and opinion, but it's irrational to choose to interpret a tee as a threat and upset oneself. Exercise intellectual integrity and acknowledge that you want to stop folks down so @united can enforce a dress code. Argue for THAT. \u2014 lizbuddie (@lizbuddie) October 12, 2019\n\n@united you need to review your policy about how to handle a threat. What\u2019s the difference between a T-shirt and the man holding a sign that said the same? I\u2019m horrified you let him stay. \u2014 Regan Fletcher Stephens (@ReganStephens) October 12, 2019\n\n\u201cLOOK OUT!!! HE HAS A T-SHIRT\u201d \u2014 tom (@tomd44) October 12, 2019\n\n. It\u2019s only a threat if he\u2019s readily capable of doing such action. I doubt there is a tree or a rope on that plane. Therefore it\u2019s free speech. \u2014 Antonio Salguero (@Salguero4Senate) October 11, 2019\n\nThe First Amendment does protect everyone-and the US Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that hate speech is legally protected under the First Amendment \u2014 Tim Jeffreys (@RadioTimJ) October 11, 2019\n\nFirst, \"Fighting words\" are not protected, and that shirt *easily* can be seen as inciting violence. Second, United is a private company, not Congress. Zero First Amendment application. Sorry. \u2014 Trevor S. Valle (@tattoosandbones) October 12, 2019\n\nAre there no rules? I would be wary of sitting next to this man \u2014 paulaptb (@paulaptlb) October 12, 2019\n\nrelax, it's just a tshirt \u2014 Tina Shumway (@TiffClina) October 11, 2019\n\nYeah freedom of speech is threatening. Or, maybe you could recognize that journalists are mostly propagandists and that folks are getting very frustrated about it? \u2014 Rob McNealy (@RobMcNealy) October 11, 2019\n\n@united you are shameful. That man was threatening to passengers. He should have been removed. Not the threatened passengers. I\u2019ll send this to the @FBI maybe they can straighten it out. \u2014 Windwalker \ud83d\udea9 (@windwalker1020) October 12, 2019\n\nYeah, maybe the FBI can straighten this out.\n\nreplace \"journalist\" with \"president\" and see how little they can do about offensive shirts \u2014 basic white dude (@mediumcooI) October 12, 2019\n\nI find it offensive that your brother took this man\u2019s photograph without his consent. \u2014 Doc (@RidemDoc) October 12, 2019\n\n@United, I stand with others, as a customer, demanding that you to take a stand against people being able to wear THREATENING messages. \u2014 Perrkj \ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udd98 (@mitgoalie) October 11, 2019\n\nHow did he get through @TSA? \u2014 Joe Flood (@joeflood) October 11, 2019\n\nPretty damn easily, we\u2019d guess \u2026 walking through like everyone else.\n\nGood thread with some great points, however, to me, it's just a shirt with words on it. You may think it \"easily\" incites violence, but I disagree. As for the 1st amendment, if the man was asked to get off the plane and refused-and the police were called it gets a bit dicey. \u2014 Tim Jeffreys (@RadioTimJ) October 12, 2019\n\nFor a threat to be real it must be specific, actionable, and imminent. This literally says \"I have to build the tool to kill you first, come back later\". \u2014 Stringfellow Hawke (@GobsofTexas) October 12, 2019\n\nFirst, they are protected. Just because you're emotionally weak that mere words make you fearful, doesn't make it everyone else's responsibility to protect your feelings \u2014 The First Amendment Extremist 2 (@coltsfan702) October 12, 2019\n\nIt cannot be seen as \"inciting violence\" in any way at all, either \"easily\" or otherwise. Your sissy snowflake opinion notwithstanding. \u2014 Russian Dude-bot (@deadrody) October 12, 2019\n\nFor a threat to be real it must be specific, actionable, and imminent.

It\u2019s threatening and people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to wear clothing items threatening other passengers. \u2014 TheHeSaidSheSaidExp (@hesaidshesaidxp) October 12, 2019\n\nPushes button. \u201cI\u2019d like to buy that man a drink\u201d \u2014 MethLabOfDemocracy\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u269c\ufe0f (@noprezzie2012) October 12, 2019\n\nDid he say if he found out where I can get one? \u2014 tom (@tomd44) October 12, 2019\n\nWhere can I get one? \u2014 Educat\u00ebdHillbilly\u2122 (@RobProvince) October 12, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "United allowed the man with the T-shirt on the plane and offered to put the offended person on another flight.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rope-tree-journalist-t-shirt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
