Here\u2019s how to choose the right one.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cI\u2019m planning a trip to Europe and I need someone with experience in booking rail trips,\u201d said Corcos, a retired university administrator from River Forest, Ill.\n\nA quick visit to what was then the American Society of Travel Agents\u2019 website to find a specialist in European travel would have yielded a few usable leads.\n\nAD\n\nBut in the fast-changing world of travel, is anything that simple? Maybe not. Airline, car rental and hotel sites enable you to act as your own travel agent. If you need a little hand-holding, you can visit an online travel agency and avoid some fees. And now, to add to the confusion, some travel agents aren\u2019t even calling themselves agents anymore.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s right, those agents are now advisers . Last year, the American Society of Travel Agents changed its name to the American Society of Travel Advisors.\n\nPaul Metselaar says it\u2019s an important shift. Travel agents are no longer \u201corder takers,\u201d or intermediaries between the traveler and a company, he says. People now think of them as professionals, like lawyers or accountants. As the CEO of Ovation Travel Group, a New York-based agency, he was among the first to discard the \u201cagent\u201d label in favor of \u201cadviser.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs travel advisers, we\u2019ve built a significant level of trust with each of our customers on a highly personalized level,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the face of fierce competition from online agencies, travel agents are also upping their game, says Dave Hershberger, ASTA\u2019s chairman and owner of a Travel Leaders agency in Cincinnati. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest change,\u201d he says.\n\nAD\n\nInstead of offering a broad range of services, many agents now specialize in niche products such as honeymoons or cruises.\n\nIf agents \u2014 or advisers \u2014 don\u2019t see themselves as intermediaries anymore, are there some trips you should book yourself? Yes. For a simple weekend trip, self-booking might be easier. Plus, you can avoid an adviser\u2019s consulting fee, which averages about $100 per trip. But for a complicated rail adventure through Europe, like the one Corcos is planning, you\u2019ll probably want to hire an adviser.\n\nAD\n\nSo how to find an agent in this topsy-turvy world of travel?\n\nYou\u2019ll still want to look for certifications and association memberships. For example, the Travel Institute\u2019s Certified Travel Associate (CTA) and Certified Travel Counselor (CTC) designations mean an agent has taken the time to study and understand travel. In 2017, ASTA created a Verified Travel Advisor program, which indicates that an adviser has met \u201ca higher level of verifiable professional knowledge.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOf course, membership in ASTA or in the Association of Retail Travel Agents is also a sign that your travel adviser means business.\n\nSome of the best travel agents, or advisers, are affiliated with well-known franchises, such as American Express or Carlson Wagonlit Travel, or with an agency network such as Travel Leaders, Signature or Virtuoso. These affiliations offer peace of mind and, sometimes, lower prices.\n\nAD\n\nFor example, membership in Travel Leaders or a similar network means that the agent is properly trained and insured and that there\u2019s an 800 number you can call 24/7. \u201cIt ensures that you have someone to help you if your trip is disrupted or you need advice once you arrive in your destination,\u201d says Roger Block, president of the Travel Leaders Network.\n\nThere\u2019s more, says Matthew Upchurch, the CEO of Virtuoso, a network of luxury travel advisers. \u201cReputation, experience and professionalism certainly come into play,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then you have to count on the X-factor, which really comes down to chemistry.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVirtuoso\u2019s directory of advisers includes detailed biographical information, including years of experience, languages spoken, verified reviews and recommendations from clients, travel specialties, and destinations personally visited.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA great travel adviser will be happy to provide references \u2014 not just online testimonials, which can be posted by anyone,\u201d says Christine Hardenberger, owner of Modern Travel Professionals, a full-service travel agency in Virginia Beach. \u201cPeople are less likely to lie when contacted directly.\u201d\n\nAbove all, stay flexible as the industry changes. Behind the scenes, the economics of being a travel adviser are still shifting, says Jack Ezon, the founder of Embark, a new platform for travel agencies. \u201cThe next generation of travel advisers will turn the entire model upside down to be more customer-centric.\u201d\n\nThat would be good \u2014 for everyone.\n\nRead more from Travel:\n\nAD", "description": "Look for experience, certified expertise and a solid reputation when shopping for advice.", "authors": ["Christopher Elliott"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/amEwQcALOmiaE4ztXwwwcV9kwdM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AOFIEZXJ6AI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
