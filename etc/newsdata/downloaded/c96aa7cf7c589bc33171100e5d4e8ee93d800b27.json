It\u2019s not high gloss or terribly stylish (definitely not Instagram worthy), but on those nights when you need a reliable companion, there\u2019s nothing that you crave more.\n\nBalancing her family and her job at the San Francisco Police Department, Sgt. Lindsay Boxer tries to have it all for the holidays. She\u2019s running from a serious crime scene - a cop was shot and the suspect is dead - to tree-trimming with her toddler.\n\nBut this is, at its core, a feel-good novel, even with its blood, guts and bodies piling up. There\u2019s no way the criminal mastermind, known only as \u201cLoman,\u201d is going to ruin that.\n\nOh, he tries: Loman has sacrificial \u201cfriends,\u201d a plot to assume a new identity with a hefty offshore bank and an almost entirely frozen heart. It turns out, though, he has a soft spot for his wife.\n\nChristmas is her birthday, and when he screws up his own greedy plan, he can\u2019t let her take the fall.\n\nHe would let the snitches on his payroll do that, even his long-time associate (Dare we call him a \u201cfriend\u201d?). He wasn\u2019t going to let his \u201cBunny\u201d rot in her orange jail jumpsuit, though.\n\nInterestingly, Bunny - aka Imogene - is probably the most complex character in the book. She thinks she\u2019s the housewife of a middle-class jewelry salesman, not a criminal mastermind. When she finds out otherwise, she doesn\u2019t take it well.\n\nNeither does the heroine Lindsay, of course. But she\u2019s gotten a little hard around the edges and isn\u2019t so sure of her priorities.\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing she has her posse, including friends in the district attorney and medical examiner offices, and an investigative reporter - and a great New Year\u2019s Eve around the corner.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"The 19th Christmas\" (Little, Brown and Co.) by James Patterson and Maxine Paetro", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Samantha Critchell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/book_review_-_the_19th_christmas_47517_c0-892-1836-1962_s1770x1032.jpg?69e3b113d99a95138ba7ecd87dea023c2cab037f", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
