Tonight, as candidates began discussing their plans to end America\u2019s seemingly endless spree of mass shootings, something remarkable happened: Again and again, they turned to O\u2019Rourke, commending him on how he has handled the aftermath of the latest violence in his home state.\n\nThe moderator then turned to O\u2019Rourke. In a question about O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposed gun-buyback program, the moderator spoke directly to conservatives\u2019 central fear: that gun-reform proposals are really just an excuse for the government to get rid of Americans\u2019 guns. So, O\u2019Rourke was asked, \u201cAre you proposing taking away their guns?\u201d\n\nThe former congressman was unapologetic. \u201cI am,\u201d he said, \u201cif it\u2019s a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield.\u201d And there may be room for compromise, he said: Attendees at a recent gun show he visited in Conway, Arkansas, were open to his proposals to limit the distribution of weapons such as AR-15s. \u201cLet\u2019s do the right thing,\u201d he said, and \u201cbring everyone in America into the conversation\u2014Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, and non-gun-owners alike.\u201d\n\nAccording to public-opinion polling, O\u2019Rourke is right, at least to an extent: Strong majorities of Americans from both parties, including those who own guns and those who don\u2019t, agree on policies like implementing basic background checks, although there\u2019s less consensus on banning \u201cassault-style weapons\u201d and high-capacity magazines. So far in this Democratic primary race, as in his failed bid to become a U.S. senator in 2018, O\u2019Rourke has not been a consensus-focused candidate; he has tried to appeal to the left.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s experience in El Paso may have permanently shifted his presidential bid, and perhaps his political career. When he speaks about this issue, he appears to speak from the heart. The Democratic presidential candidates agree that they have to do something about how guns are bought and sold in America. In the end, O\u2019Rourke may not make it to the White House, but on this issue, he may lead the way.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
