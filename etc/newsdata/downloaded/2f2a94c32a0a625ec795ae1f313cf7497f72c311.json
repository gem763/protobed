Yet, in the two weeks since the House of Representatives started formally investigating the president, veterans of the Nixon administration have been notable only for their silence.\n\nIn fact, they have been about as willing to answer questions about impeachment now as they were when they were being dragged before House and Senate investigative committees at the height of the Watergate scandal.\n\nThe main keeper of the 37th president\u2019s flame, the Richard Nixon Foundation, offered not one word for or against Trump when approached. A post-presidential chief of staff told the Guardian he was \u201cpretty much focused elsewhere\u201d. A former domestic policy aide who served on Nixon\u2019s legal defense team refused to speak on the record \u2013 even though he writes regular, highly opinionated pieces for conservative outlets that touch on impeachment, whistleblowers, special prosecutors and more.\n\nAn outspoken former Nixon speechwriter, Bruce Herschensohn, declared in an email: \u201cI believe in saving the possibility of impeachment for impeachable offenses as defined by the U.S. Founders and authors of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d\n\nWhen asked, however, whether the allegation against Trump, subverting national security policy to search for dirt on his enemies, might constitute just such an impeachable offense, Herschensohn went silent.\n\nSuch skittishness is more bad news for Trump, since the Republican party as a whole is showing reluctance to speak up in his defense and, on the issue of withdrawing support from Kurds in Syria, a willingness to be openly critical.\n\nThe Nixon crowd can generally be counted on to be good Republican partisans, not least because the foundation, among others, relies on the party base to make donations, buy tickets to events, and otherwise contribute to the furtherance of Nixon\u2019s memory. Recent invitees to foundation events in Yorba Linda, California, where Nixon was born, include the Fox News hosts Jeanine Pirro and Bret Baier, the former House speaker Newt Gingrich, and Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court appointee, Neil Gorsuch.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the House speaker, is joined by the House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, at a news conference as House Democrats move ahead in the impeachment inquiry on 2 October.

Nixon, unlike Trump, was a firm believer in international alliances and treaties, and for all his willingness to lean on the FBI and the IRS to do his political bidding domestically he never \u2013 at least as president \u2013 sought to extract political favors from overseas allies or client states.\n\nSome of that ambivalence was expressed by Bob Bostock, a post-presidential Nixon staffer who put together a sympathetic account of the Watergate scandal for display at the Nixon Presidential Library in the days when it was still controlled by loyalists. (The library was taken over by the National Archives in 2007 and the display subsequently replaced.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe for a second that Nixon committed an impeachable offense,\u201d Bostock said. \u201cI don\u2019t think President Clinton committed an impeachable offense. Andrew Johnson certainly didn\u2019t. With respect to Trump \u2013 it\u2019s way too early.\u201d\n\nBostock, a lifelong Republican, complained about the bitter partisan atmosphere in Washington and said he suspected impeachment was just another form of cross-party political warfare. But he also acknowledged that goading foreign countries into interfering in US elections was not acceptable. Whether Trump had done such a thing \u201cremains an open question\u201d, he said.\n\nWhile it seems likely that other Nixonians share conflicted views, the reluctance of many to air them publicly points to a problem they have with the whole notion of presidential abuse of power. For 45 years they have refused to accept that Nixon was guilty of this particular article of impeachment (the other two were obstruction of justice and contempt of Congress), which puts them in an awkward spot with Trump because the Ukraine scandal turns entirely on use or misuse of power.", "description": "Nixon administration veterans and members of his foundation had little to say when approached by the GuardianRichard Nixon waves goodbye from the steps of his helicopter outside the White House, after he gave a farewell address to members of the White House staff, in August 1974.
