He has also chopped the company's dividend to a penny.\n\nGE and its finance arm had total borrowings of about $105.8 billion as of June 30, with industrial net debt at $54.4 billion.\n\nThe company said it will also freeze supplementary pension benefits for about 700 U.S. employees who became executives before 2011. GE's pension plan has been closed to new entrants since 2012.
