A report from ESPN\u2019s Jeremy Fowler now shows that Gordon may be blinking in his standoff.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nW/ LAC showing little interest in a trade, Melvin Gordon will continue to \"protect himself\" with holdout but will report to the team in '19, per source. \"Not a Le'Veon Bell situation,\" source said. \"He still wants to be a Charger.\" Midseason/early Nov. return looking more likely \u2014 Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) September 13, 2019\n\nGordon soon responded by signaling that any reports without a direct quote from him are not to be trusted, something he pretty much has to do to maintain what leverage he has.\n\nStop listening to sources you don\u2019t hear it quoted by me !!! It ain\u2019t me \ud83e\udd1c\ud83c\udfff\ud83e\udd1b\ud83c\udfff \u2014 F L \u26a1\ufe0f S H (@Melvingordon25) September 13, 2019\n\nThat Gordon will report at some point is not too big of a surprise. The 26-year-old former first-rounder may be inspired by Le\u2019Veon Bell\u2019s holdout last season, but one major difference is that Gordon is actually still under contract.\n\nStory continues\n\nBell was freed from the Pittsburgh Steelers because he never signed his franchise tender. The Steelers decided not to tag him again, and he was free to go. However, since Gordon is in the final year of his contract, if he doesn\u2019t report by Week 10, this season will not count, and the Chargers will retain his rights in 2020, making his holdout moot.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nGordon wants a raise on his $5.6 million salary, likely in the eight figures after Ezekiel Elliott landed a massive new deal. It\u2019s fair for him to want to protect himself from injuries to ensure he\u2019ll reach that new pay day, and cutting his number of games played in half could be an effective way to do that.\n\nHowever, every day that he\u2019s away from the Chargers could be another point towards how replaceable running backs are in the NFL. If the Chargers are just fine without their big-name back, other teams may not be as willing to shell out $10 million next summer.\n\nChargers running back Melvin Gordon will reportedly return this season.
