It\u2019s therefore a bit ironic to hear the Republican make a spirited case that his efforts to coerce foreign governments to help his re-election campaign are really just an extension of a sincere anti-corruption crusade.\n\nIt\u2019s clear Trump has settled on this as his principal talking point, as evidenced by this morning\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cAs President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!\u201d\n\nDuring a brief Q&A with reporters this morning, the Republican stuck to the phrasing with almost comical repetition, as if he\u2019d been led to believe the words are a magical elixir that will make his scandals go away.\n\nThe pitch is so fanciful, it\u2019s almost insulting. Americans are genuinely supposed to believe that Trump and his GOP cohorts, indifferent to Joe Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine for several years, suddenly decided the former vice president is guilty of serious wrongdoing, evidence be damned. Trump and his allies came to this realization quite suddenly, and it occurred to them \u2013 coincidentally, of course \u2013 right around the time polls showed Biden leading the president in national polling by double digits.\n\nThe Republican, according to the White House\u2019s preferred narrative, isn\u2019t concerned at all with Biden\u2019s 2020 bid. Heaven forbid. Trump, his own corruption notwithstanding, simply feels an obligation to root out corruption wherever he finds it. By this reasoning, our beleaguered president is actually something akin to a hero, putting electoral considerations aside in a quest for good government around the globe.\n\nIf members of Team Trump believe such a laughable story is going to derail the impeachment process, they\u2019re likely to be disappointed.\n\nIn fact, the house of cards seemed to collapse quite suddenly this morning, when a White House reporter had the good sense to ask a question the president didn\u2019t see coming.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Eamon Javers asked Trump if he\u2019s ever sought a corruption investigation from foreign leaders targeting someone who isn\u2019t one of his political opponents.\n\n\u201cYou know, we would have to look,\u201d the president said, apparently unable to think of a comparable example.\n\nLet me save the White House staff some trouble: international corruption has never been a subject of interest to Trump. As the Washington Post reported on Monday, \u201cA search through Trump\u2019s past comments on corruption shows he has rarely raised concerns about corruption in foreign countries \u2013 except when it suited his political purposes.\u201d\n\nImagine that.", "description": "Trump's defense for pressing foreign governments for campaign help is so fanciful, it's almost insulting.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_msnbc_brk_trump_biden_191004_1920x1080.jpg?itok=dh-Xu4Yp", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
