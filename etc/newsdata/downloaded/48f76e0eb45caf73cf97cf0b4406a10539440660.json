The ground is saturated and some trees were just coming down everywhere,\u201d said Charlie Blanton, a homeowner in North Carolina.\n\nOne of those trees crushed Charlie Blanton\u2019s family home. He says he still has several months of work left to repair the damages. He says it will cost $150,000 to fix everything up.\n\n\u201cThe fan that was up here had water pouring down off of it, right there in the middle of the room,\u201d he said, as he described the damage done to the roof of his home.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Florence caused $22 billion in damages in North Carolina. There is currently no estimate available yet for Hurricane Dorians.\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN SETS SIGHTS ON CANADA AFTER 'BIBLICAL' FLOODING IN NORTH CAROLINA\n\n\u201cWe were just hoping that we wouldn't have another tree fall through. We still have one tree in the front of the house that is old. We did some hurricane prepping, we brought everything inside that was outside, but we were also prepping the house that we're standing in now, so we just basically had constant worry during the whole storm,\u201d Blanton said.\n\nCharlie says several houses in the area are still rebuilding. Due to the destruction, his daughter says she can still barely recognize the home.\n\nSTRANDED BAHAMIANS WAIT TO GET OFF ABACO ISLAND: 'ONLY ANIMALS CAN LIVE HERE'\n\n\u201cThis was my room. Sadly, it\u2019s no longer very much of a room. We had a bunk bed over there in the back corner, a toilet right here, which we don\u2019t have anymore,\u201d said Bernadette Blanton.\n\nThe Blantons have been staying with friends for over a year. About 400 families are still living in temporary housing since Florence.\n\nFor Charlie, with Dorian behind him, he says he hasn\u2019t let his guard down. He is ready for what comes next.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely dodged a bullet and I hope that we can get our house done before the next hurricane comes because we'll be ready and now we know what to do.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile skies are looking clear in the Carolinas post-Dorian, there are still roughly 240,000 power outages reported across the Carolinas.
