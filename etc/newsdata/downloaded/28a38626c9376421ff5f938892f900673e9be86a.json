REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov\n\nThe battle for Ras al Ain raged as Turkey pursued a four-day-old, cross-border offensive against a Syrian Kurdish militia despite an outcry from the United States and European Union and warnings of possible sanctions unless Ankara desisted.\n\nWashington said Turkey\u2019s incursion was causing \u201cgreat harm\u201d in relations with its NATO ally. The Arab League\u2019s head called it \u201can invasion of an Arab state\u2019s land\u201d. nL2N26W1FT]\n\nThe Turkish assault has raised alarm about its humanitarian fall-out. The regional Kurdish-led administration in Syria\u2019s northeast said nearly 200,000 people had been displaced as a result, while the U.N. World Food Programme put the figure at more than 100,000 in the towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain.\n\nTurkey began its onslaught against the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as a terrorist group, after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew some U.S. troops who had been backing Kurdish forces in the fight against Islamic State militants.\n\n\u201cThe (Syrian rebel) national army took control of (Ras al Ain) town centre this morning,\u201d a senior Turkish security official said. \u201cInspections are being conducted in residential areas. Mine and booby trap searches are being carried out.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defence Ministry subsequently said Ras al Ain had been brought under control, with officials posting photos showing deserted streets and Syrian rebels standing on Kurdish militia flags.\n\nBut the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in which the YPG comprises the main fighting element, swiftly denied losing the centre of Ras al Ain.\n\nMarvan Qamishlo, an SDF spokesman, said Turkish-backed forces had entered the town\u2019s industrial district following hours of heavy Turkish shelling that had forced the SDF into a \u201ctactical retreat\u201d from that area.\n\n\u201cNow the SDF\u2019s attack has started and there are very fierce clashes now,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThe clashes are continuing in the industrial district,\u201d he said, saying this was the part of Ras al Ain closest to the border.\n\nIn response, the senior Turkish official said fighting was going on in \u201ctwo small areas\u201d of Ras al Ain but that \u201cnearly all\u201d YPG forces had fled to the south. Turkish artillery continued to bombard parts of the town, a Reuters reporter said.\n\nTurkish forces had overnight stepped up their bombardment of Ras al Ain in their incursion, after U.S. troops in the vicinity came under artillery fire from Turkish positions.\n\nTURKEY SEEKS \u201cSAFE ZONE\u201d\n\nIn the latest international censure of the assault, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit on Saturday called it an \u201cinvasion of an Arab state\u2019s land and an aggression on its sovereignty\u201d.\n\nIraqi Foreign Minister Mohamed Ali Alhakim, president of the current Arab League session, also condemned the offensive during an emergency meeting for the body. He called on the League to reinstate Syria\u2019s membership in the body.\n\nErdogan has dismissed the mounting condemnation of the operation and said on Friday evening that Turkey \u201cwill not stop it, no matter what anyone says\u201d.\n\nTurkey aims to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria to resettle many of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees it has been hosting. Erdogan threatened to send them to Europe if the EU did not back his assault.\n\nOn Saturday morning, thick plumes of smoke rose around Ras al Ain, one of two Syrian border towns targeted in the offensive, as Turkish artillery pounded the area. Intense gunfire also resounded within Ras al Ain in the early hours, while warplanes could be heard flying overhead.\n\nIt was quieter at Tel Abyad, the operation\u2019s other main target some 120 km (75 miles) to the west, with only occasional shelling heard in the area, a Reuters reporter said.\n\nThe Turkish-backed SDF said earlier they had cut a road linking Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad and had captured 18 villages since the operation began.\n\nU.S. TROOPS UNDER FIRE\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon said U.S. troops came under artillery fire from Turkish emplacements though none of its soldiers were wounded near the Syrian border town of Kobani, 60 km (37 miles) west of the main area of conflict.\n\nTurkey said its forces did not shoot back at the U.S. base and took all precautions to prevent any harm to it while it was responding to YPG fire from a nearby area.\n\n\u201cU.S. and coalition soldiers were definitely not hit. Indeed the necessary coordination is being carried out by our headquarters and the Americans,\u201d Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar was quoted as saying on Saturday.\n\nSeventy-four Kurdish-led fighters, 49 Turkey-backed Syrian rebels and 30 civilians have been killed in the fighting, according to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor.\n\nTurkey said 415 YPG militants had been \u201cneutralised\u201d since the operation began, a term that commonly means killed.\n\nOvernight a car bomb exploded outside the wall of the prison in Hasaka in northeast Syria, causing serious damage but no casualties, a statement from security forces in the region said. It did not say if any Islamic State prisoners had escaped.\n\nThe SDF\u2019s Qamishlo said the attack was carried out by Islamic State (IS) sleeper cells.\n\nThe SDF holds most of the northern Syrian territory that once made up Islamic State\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d in the country, and has been keeping thousands of fighters from the jihadist group in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nThe SDF says the Turkish assault could allow the jihadist group to re-emerge. In its first big attack since the assault began, IS claimed responsibility for a deadly car bomb in Qamishli, the largest city in the Kurdish-held area.\n\nFive IS militants fled a jail there, and foreign women from the group being held in a camp torched tents and attacked guards with sticks and stones, the SDF said.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper has told his Turkish counterpart they should de-escalate the conflict before the situation becomes \u201cirreparable\u201d.\n\nErdogan\u2019s spokesman rebuffed the criticism on Saturday, saying \u201cTurkey\u2019s fight is against terrorists, not Kurds or civilians\u201d. The spokesman told those who condemn Turkey that thousands of civilians were killed in previous U.S.-led coalition operations in Syria\u2019s Raqqa and Iraq\u2019s Mosul.\n\n\u201cBlackmail and threats will never deter Turkey from its just cause,\u201d Ibrahim Kalin wrote on Twitter. \u201cGod willing victory will be ours.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nU.S. lawmakers introduced more legislation on Friday seeking stiff sanctions on Turkey over the offensive, underscoring unhappiness from both Democrats and President Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress over his Syria policy.\n\nU.S. military officials denied lawmakers\u2019 accusations that Washington abandoned U.S. allies. Ankara says it aims to defeat the YPG, which it sees as an enemy for its links to Kurdish militants who have waged an insurgency in Turkey since 1984.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump had authorized the drafting of \u201cvery significant\u201d new sanctions against Turkey and would activate them if necessary.", "description": "Turkish-backed Syrian rebels advanced into Ras al Ain in northeast Syria on Saturday but it was unclear how far they had reached, with Turkey saying the town centre had been taken and Kurdish-led forces denying this and saying they were counter-attacking.", "authors": ["Orhan Coskun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439978664&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B07T", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
