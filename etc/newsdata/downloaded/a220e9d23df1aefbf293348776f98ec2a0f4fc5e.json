Separation anxiety in children is the fear and worry youngsters experience when they can't be with their parents or guardians. Children with separation anxiety typically: - protest, cry or struggle when being separated from their mother or father - worry about getting hurt or having an accident (they might worry about their parents or themselves) - refuse to go to or stay at day care, preschool or school by themselves - refuse to sleep at other people's homes without their parents there too and complain of feeling sick when separated\n\n'When we reached her class I told her they were fully charged and to press it whenever she missed me and it would give her a magic hug from me and vice versa.\n\n'Hey presto!!! She went in with no tears, just a kiss and a smile. She asked me when she came out how many times I pressed my magic button today and I said 10 times!!! She smiled and said \"same as me\".'\n\nSpeaking to FEMAIL about the idea, the mother-of-three said: 'My daughter turned six in August so is one of the youngest in her year.\n\n'She has suffered with separation anxiety for as long as I can remember.\n\n'I tried what the school suggested which was walking away when she started up but it got to the point of her starting as soon as she woke up in the morning and the silent tears and shaking broke me.'\n\nMelissa, a midday supervisory assistant, said she read about the 'hug button' online, adding: 'One morning when trying to leave the house she was getting upset and there was a Sharpie on my dining table and I thought I'd give it a try.\n\nSocial media users were quick to praise the idea, taking to the comments to suggest that they would soon be trying it with their little ones\n\n'That morning has changed her life and mine and we now have no issues.
