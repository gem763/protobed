'It's how you react and how you overcome the hurdles.\n\n'We had a couple of situations last season exactly the same and he came roaring back. He looked a really good keeper today.'\n\nHenderson's crucial saves bookended the second-half at Vicarage Road and left basement club Watford frustrated as they continue to await their first victory of the season.\n\nAndre Gray had the pick of the chances in the first half but blazed the ball over the crossbar\n\nThe curious thing about their predicament is that they do know how to create chances.\n\nOnly Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool had made more opportunities than the Hornets in the opening seven Premier League rounds prior to this fixture.\n\nBut the reason Watford are already cut adrift at the bottom is that they don't take them and so it proved again here.\n\nMoments after the start of the second-half, John Egan stooped to try and head a low bouncing ball inside the centre circle, only for Danny Welbeck to nick it past him and surge clean through on goal.\n\nWelbeck had Andre Gray alongside him but declined the pass in search of personal glory and was denied by Henderson, who stood tall to block with his right leg, much to Gray's annoyance.\n\nSheffield United also had their chances but struggled to break the deadlock on Saturday\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd deep into stoppage time, Henderson plunged to his right to save Craig Dawson's header after Roberto Pereyra's searching free-kick had breached United lines.\n\nBut Watford's clearest opening came inside the opening 10 minutes and Gray will spend much of the international fortnight wondering how he didn't take it.\n\nA hopeful ball played down the right touchline exploited slack positioning by Enda Stevens and Jack O'Connell, allowing Pereyra to scamper onto it after Henderson decided against rushing out.\n\nThe Blades were at sixes and sevens and Pereyra had plenty of time to roll a low cross past Henderson's reach and into Gray, who just needed to tap into an empty net from barely five yards.\n\nBut somehow the Watford striker spooned his shot over the bar to general disbelief in the stands.\n\nWatford took their first clean sheet since February but remain without a win this season\n\nWatford's Abdoulaye Doucoure in action with Sheffield United's Jack O'Connell in tight contest\n\nMATCH FACTS Watford (5-3-2): Foster 6.5; Janmaat 6, Cathcart (c) 6, Prodl 6 (Dawson 57, 6), Kabasele 6, Holebas 6; Cleverley 6, Doucoure 6.5, Pereyra 6.5; Welbeck 5 (Sarr 76), Gray 5 (Deulofeu 59, 6) Substitutes not used: Gomes (GK); Chalobah, Hughes, Femenia Manager: Quique Sanchez Flores 5 Sheffield United (3-5-2): Henderson 7; Basham 6.5, Egan 6, O'Connell 6; Baldock 6, Lundstram 6, Norwood (c) 6, Fleck 6, Stevens 6; McBurnie 5.5 (Mousset 62, 6), Robinson 5 (Sharp 71, 6) Substitutes not used: Moore (GK); Jagielka, Osborn, Freeman, Besic Manager: Chris Wilder 6 Booked: McBurnie, Lundstram Referee: Andre Marriner (West Midlands) 6 Attendance: 20,811 Man of the match: Dean Henderson (Sheffield United)\n\nSurely Troy Deeney, watching from an executive box as he recovers from knee surgery, would have gobbled up such a chance.\n\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores set up his team in a belt and braces 5-3-2 formation despite playing at home to a newly-promoted side who play a similar style.\n\nIt helped ensure Watford's first league clean sheet in 20 matches but surely stifled their creativity.\n\n'It wasn't our intention to play on the counter-attack, we tried to play in different ways,' Sanchez Flores said.\n\n'We can take confidence from not conceding goals but it is very clear we created the best opportunities. In another moment of the season, with more confidence, they would be goals.'\n\nMeanwhile, United were well organised and enjoyed the lion's share of possession but created little.\n\nNevertheless, they look streetwise enough to compete in the Premier League and appear unlikely to be sucked into a relegation battle.\n\nWatford are undoubtedly in one and must locate their elusive cutting edge.\n\nChris Wilder's Sheffield United remain just outside top ten after clinching a valuable away point", "description": "ADAM SHERGOLD AT VICARAGE ROAD: Dean Henderson's crucial saves bookended the second-half at Vicarage Road and left basement club Watford frustrated as they continue to await their first victory.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/19/19339118-0-image-a-32_1570298980459.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
