About 54,000 acres already have been torched, 94 structures destroyed and State Route 128 turned into a hellish gantlet. And 80,000 structures remain under threat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the largest evacuation that any of us at the Sheriff\u2019s Office can remember,\u201d the Sonoma Sheriff\u2019s Department tweeted in both English and Spanish. \u201cTake care of each other.\u201d\n\nThroughout the day, with gusts up to 93 mph sweeping through the hills and valleys, state and local officials expanded the number of areas under mandatory evacuation orders. Some in Santa Rosa were told to leave. Evacuation warnings were later issued to communities in neighboring Napa County.\n\n\u201cApocalyptic,\u201d said Carol Pajala, 67, who fled her home in Santa Rosa with her husband, David, and their golden retriever after the predawn alert came through. The couple found shelter at a fairground in Petaluma, a city about 17 miles south, where authorities had established a space for displaced residents.\n\nAD\n\nStrong winds kicked up leaves and knocked down branches. Roads were congested as residents packed up their cars and RVs to head out of the county. Traffic lights at some intersections lost power, further slowing evacuation efforts, yet overall the process went smoothly, officials said. Sonoma County shelters were filled with about 4,600 people.\n\nAD\n\nFire encroaching the highway on 128, both sides, in Sonoma Co. in Healdsburg.

They\u2019d started to prepare the night before, collecting papers, passports, instruments, paintings and sentimental items, such as a needlepoint passed down to Tryph from her great-great-grandmother and a mask that her daughter had made in seventh grade.\n\nThe flames kept approaching as they packed. They \u201clooked like lava coming over the crest of the hill,\u201d Tryph said.\n\nAD\n\nAbout 200 patients were evacuated Sunday from two medical centers in the area, Kaiser Permanente and Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital, and relocated to safer facilities, according to hospital and local fire officials.\n\nNo deaths had been reported as of Sunday evening, but two firefighters were burned, officials said. One was transported with minor injuries while another was flown to UC Davis Medical Center in more serious condition.\n\nForecasters said low humidity and abnormally dry vegetation had created tinderbox conditions, which, combined with the high winds, were \u201cplenty supportive of extreme fire spread.\u201d National Weather Service forecasters warned that the dry, gusty winds would probably continue through Monday morning.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is probably one of the biggest weather incidents in California history,\u201d said Craig Clements, a fire meteorologist at San Jose State University.\n\nThe governor described the situation as a \u201cchallenging moment in our history.\u201d\n\nOf utmost concern was the risk of new blazes igniting as a result of those conditions. Red flag warnings indicating weather with high fire risk were issued in 43 counties by Sunday evening, officials said.\n\nCal Fire analyst Steve Volmer said authorities were concerned about an area west of Highway 101 that has not burned for decades and contains \u201cextremely dense\u201d and dry fuel for flames to consume. Officials closed the highway near Windsor and Healdsburg because of poor visibility but managed to keep the blaze to the east of the highway.\n\nAD\n\nScientists say climate change is exacerbating California\u2019s natural cycle of drought and fire. Temperatures have risen significantly since the 1970s, and the amount of precipitation has been consistently below average for at least a decade.\n\nAD\n\nThe little moisture that grasses and plants store to survive will easily evaporate, turning parched vegetation into a perfect fuel \u2014 vulnerable to a spark from a utility line or power tool, a lightning strike or a carelessly tossed cigarette.\n\nAfter the Kincade Fire started Wednesday, worries about its potential led Pacific Gas & Electric to announce a massive power shutdown \u2014 the largest planned outage in the state\u2019s history, on the heels of another unprecedented electricity disruption meant to curb fire risk this month. The blackouts, affecting 38 counties, began in Northern California at about 5 p.m. local time Saturday and cascaded south throughout the evening, according to a statement from the company.\n\nAD\n\nAn estimated 965,000 customers \u2014 or nearly 3 million people \u2014 were braced for no power through the weekend as a result of fire prevention measures. An additional 100,000 customers lost power unplanned, probably because of infrastructure damage, PG&E officials said. Amid wind sometimes topping 90 mph, the company expects far more destruction than it found inspecting its lines after the last mass shutdown.\n\nAD\n\nWeather with high fire risk could cause another mass outage starting Tuesday, the company said. More than 30 counties could be affected, and notifications had gone out to half a million customers by Sunday evening.\n\nThe good news, officials said, is that there\u2019s no shutdown on the horizon afterward \u2014 yet.\n\nAD\n\nThis part of California has experienced two years of the deadliest and most destructive blazes in state history.\n\nDuring last November\u2019s Camp Fire, which leveled Paradise, 153,000 acres burned and about 52,000 people were ordered from their homes. The October 2017 Tubbs Fire in Sonoma County burned 36,000 acres and forced 97,000 people to leave the area.\n\nCollectively, more than 100 people lost their lives.\n\nThe latest evacuations and warnings triggered uneasy flashbacks for some.\n\n\u201cAll we can do is hope and pray,\u201d said Riki Sandtree of Monte Rio, who\u2019d retreated to a shelter on the Sonoma fairgrounds. \u201cStuff can be replaced, but your life is your life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot every resident immediately heeded the call to leave. Mike Martinez was still in Windsor in the morning, despite the alerts he\u2019d received.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a barn, a residence and a lot of equipment a half-mile from here,\u201d said Martinez, 69. \u201cI\u2019ve also got a pool and some pumps, and I\u2019m going to try to save it.\u201d\n\nBy evening, firefighters there were still keeping the blaze at bay.\n\nMore than 3,000 people were on hand to battle the Kincade Fire, assisted by 50 helicopters and several air tankers that flew suppression missions as the weather allowed. Elsewhere in Northern California, crews battled smaller blazes that prompted evacuations and burned buildings. But the Kincade Fire \u201cremains the most stubborn challenge that we face,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nShifts in the wind forecast for Monday afternoon will help firefighting efforts, authorities said. But worrisome gusts could pick up again later.\n\nAD\n\nThe mandatory evacuations on Santa Rosa\u2019s northwest corner and part of its northeast affected 60,000 people as of Sunday morning, said Paul Lowenthal, assistant fire marshal with the Santa Rosa Fire Department. The rest of the city of about 175,000 was warned to be ready to leave if conditions worsened.\n\nAlong Santa Rosa\u2019s main drag downtown, at the edge of the evacuation zones, most stores were closed. But Belly Left Coast Kitchen and Tap Room was packed at 2 p.m. Owner Gray Rollin said he opened up with the community and evacuees in mind.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s craziness going on all around us,\u201d Rollin said. \u201cThey need a sense of normality.\u201d\n\nTeague and Donosky reported from Santa Rosa and Petaluma, Calif.; Epstein reported from Washington.
