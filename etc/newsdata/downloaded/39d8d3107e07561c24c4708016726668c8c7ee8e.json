In one of the most publicized, a passenger was left with a bloody face after another passenger\u2019s dog attacked him.\n\nDOG WALKER CAUGHT RUMMAGING THROUGH CLIENTS' REFRIGERATOR, DRINKING THEIR BOOZE\n\nThe Atlanta-based airline made the announcement on Monday, detailing that the changes were in response to the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s final statement of enforcement priorities for service and support animals, which was published in August.\n\n\u201cEffective immediately, Delta is discontinuing its 8-hour flight limit for ESAs [emotional support animals],\u201d reps for the carrier said in a news release. \u201cAfter working with the DOT and cross-divisional business groups, Delta was able to develop a solution to protect the health and safety of those onboard while also allowing ESAs to fly on longer flights.\u201d\n\nThe eight-hour flight limit was in place for less than a year, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nAccording to the news release, however, the carrier plans to continue banning pit bulls from traveling as emotional support or service animals \u201cto protect the airline\u2019s employees, customers and trained service animals.\u201d\n\n\u201cPit bulls account for less than 5 percent of the overall dog population but 37.5 percent of vicious dog attacks. Understanding this risk, Delta has not come to a solution for allowing pit bulls onboard that satisfies its own rigorous safety requirements,\u201d the release said.\n\n\u201cWe will never compromise on safety, and we will do what is right for the health and safety of our customers and employees,\u201d John Laughter, senior vice president of Corporate Safety, Security and Compliance, said in defense of the decision. \u201cWe continue to work with the DOT to find solutions that support the rights of customers who have legitimate needs to travel with trained animals.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nIn June 2017, a Delta Air Lines passenger was allegedly attacked by what the police report identified as a \u201cchocolate lab pointer mix\" during a flight from Atlanta to San Diego, suffering injuries to his face and upper body. The man has since filed a lawsuit against the carrier regarding the incident.\n\nThe DOT\u2019s August guidance, meanwhile, rejected Delta\u2019s 2018 ban of \u201cpit bull-type dogs.\u201d\n\nMore specifically, the federal government said that airline employees can bar any animal they consider a safety threat but they cannot issue a blanket ban against an entire breed, such as pit bulls.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kitty Block, the president and CEO of the Humane Soceity of the U.S., described the airline\u2019s continued ban of pit bulls as deeply concerning and \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelta\u2019s decision to maintain its discriminatory ban on pit bull-type dogs as service dogs is misguided and will hurt countless individuals,\u201d Block said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to offer Delta and all airlines our support to implement alternatives that keep the skies friendly for people and animals alike.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nIn recent months, both public and professional organizations, including the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), have urged lawmakers to review the rules for service animal designations during air travel, to combat an alleged culture of \u201crampant abuse\u201d of protocol.
