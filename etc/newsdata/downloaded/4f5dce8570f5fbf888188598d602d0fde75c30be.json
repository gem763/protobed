The president chimed in by calling the mayor a \u201clightweight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWelcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors,\u201d the mayor politely clapped back.\n\nYawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors. https://t.co/v1cXvoD9uR \u2014 Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) October 8, 2019\n\nThe Trump campaign called Frey a \u201cradical leftist mayor\u201d and accused him of conjuring up excessive security charges to pressure the Target Center, the site of Thursday\u2019s planned rally, into effectively trampling on Minnesota residents\u2019 First Amendment rights to gather and yell in support of the president.\n\n\u201cFrey\u2019s city government preemptively informed the Target Center that it would be responsible for $530,000 in security and other costs related to the event. The Target Center attempted to pass the costs on to the Trump campaign under threat of withholding the use of the arena,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAfter another tweet from Trump about how he stands \u201cstrongly & proudly\u201d with \u201cgreat Police Officers,\u201d Frey told the president that the charges were necessary to pay those officers for their extra labor \u2015 and that Trump could afford it:\n\nSomeone tell the President of the United States that he can afford to help pay for the extra time our officers will be putting in while he\u2019s in town. https://t.co/bXITaPdW4E \u2014 Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) October 8, 2019\n\nIn a press conference later that day, Frey told reporters that he woke up to a \u201csurprise\u201d that morning when he discovered the president was tweeting about his city and him.\n\n\u201cI wake up every single morning with not a lot of time on my hands because I\u2019m doing things like filling potholes and making sure our city has enough affordable housing,\u201d the mayor said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time with a city of 430,000 people to be tweeting garbage out, so it\u2019s kind of surprising when the president of the United States, a country with 327 million people, has the time to do this himself, so I don\u2019t know where the guy gets the time,\u201d he added.\n\nMpls mayor @Jacob_Frey on Trump's Twitter attacks: \"I'm doing things like filling potholes & making sure our city has enough affordable housing ... I don't have time to be tweeting garbage out, so it's kinda surprising when POTUS has the time to do this himself.\" pic.twitter.com/Hn1NpoWYMV \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 8, 2019\n\nFrey also fired back at the Trump campaign\u2019s accusation that security for an Obama rally at the same venue in 2009 cost significantly less.\n\n\u201cThere are significant expenses associated with a campaign rally from Donald Trump,\u201d he said. By contrast, the Obama event focused on health care policy, he said. It was not an election rally.\n\nAccording to the mayor, the security costs for the Trump event were calculated by a standard methodology used to estimate costs of previous major events like the 2018 Super Bowl and Final Four, the Star Tribune reported. The public safety expenses were expected to be around $400,000 and the remainder would be the result of lane closures, traffic control and various other costs.\n\nShould the rally go ahead \u2015 and the campaign has said it will \u2015 this won\u2019t be the first time the Trump campaign has caused fiscal concerns for local officials. The campaign has an outstanding bill for more than $470,000 from a February rally in El Paso, Texas.\n\nNine other cities across the country have complained that they were not reimbursed for services provided by local police and fire departments, totaling more than $840,000, according to a study by the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nEl Paso confirmed to ABC News on Tuesday that its bill was still outstanding. Minneapolis seems to have taken note, as an El Paso spokesperson said Minneapolis officials had reached out to them regarding the bill.", "description": "Jacob Frey said he doesn't have time to be \"tweeting garbage\" as the mayor of a city, so he's surprised the president has time while governing a nation.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9d12732100002a0433f2e4.jpeg?cache=1cgd3gqdhx&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
