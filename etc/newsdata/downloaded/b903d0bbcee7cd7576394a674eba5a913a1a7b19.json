He is a director of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners and executive chairman of Toll Group.\n\n\u201cI'm very supportive of investment in infrastructure, having spent half my life in related industries,\u201d he said in an interview with Chanticleer.\n\n\u201cI think the advantage of investing in infrastructure is you both get the stimulus and you also get a long-term asset with it that will continue to add to growth, which is far better than any one-off stimulus you could put into the market.\u201d\n\nMullen said there was no shortage of opportunity for government assisted infrastructure investment given the strong population growth and the slow decision making over many decades in relation to critical infrastructure connections.\n\n\u201cThere's an awful lot that can be done,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI think the challenge we have is the infrastructure cycles are long. They tend to be 10 to 20-year type cycles, whereas electoral cycles are very short, which is never an incentive for any government, state or federal, to spend a lot of money and see successors two decades later reap the benefits.\n\n\u201cSomehow we really could have some political unity on both sides to make these long-term decisions that are fundamental to Australia.\u201d\n\nMullen said the amount of savings being generated through the compulsory superannuation system meant there were funds available to invest. But there needed to be some sort of incentive to invest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think some form of government incentive around trying to direct a percentage of those super investments into infrastructure with attractive tax treatments is an extremely good idea,\u201d he said.\n\nTelstra chairman John Mullen. Nick Moir\n\n\u201cI don't know why the government would not embrace that.\u201d\n\nMullen stopped short of endorsing a special infrastructure fund financed with the issue of government bonds. He said it was up to the experts to decide what was the optimal way to encourage more infrastructure investment.\n\nThe incoming president of the Business Council of Australia, Tim Reed, said the pressure should be on the state governments rather than the federal government when it came to encouraging infrastructure investment.\n\nAlso, he said it was essential governments carry some of the risks involved in infrastructure investment.\n\n\u201cI think the first thing to recognise is that much of that infrastructure comes through the states and you know, and the federal government certainly encourage it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJoe Hockey [former Treasurer] did that with the asset recycling program, and that seemed to work well. I think the government should go back and look at what worked well, before and, we\u2019d certainly encourage them to think about extending that program.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReed said the NSW government understood that infrastructure investment was part of driving productivity growth.\n\n\u201cWe would absolutely encourage state governments to continue to prioritise infrastructure and to look at continuing to build more infrastructure, whether they have to do that by taking on public debt or whether they can do that through recycling the assets that they've got,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said complaints from government that additional infrastructure investment was not possible because of a skills shortage merely highlighted the need for increased vocational training.\n\n\u201cThat gets back to our number one priority, right? \u2013 that we need to be making sure that Australians have the skills to be able to continue to contribute to growing productivity going forward.\"", "description": "Leading business figures have rallied around the idea of governments encouraging more investment in infrastructure.
