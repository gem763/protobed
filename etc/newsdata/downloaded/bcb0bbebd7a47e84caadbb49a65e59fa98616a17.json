He comes from the Texas Rangers organization, where he served as their major league player development field coordinator.\n\nTingler is currently managing Leones del Escogido of the Dominican Winter League. The team currently has four players on the roster who are tied to the Padres \u2014 pitcher Henry Henry, second baseman Ivan Castillo, first baseman Aderlin Rodriguez and outfielder Josh Naylor.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Tingler beat out ex-Rangers manager Ron Washington and Cubs bench coach Mark Loretta for the job.\n\nTingler is a relative unknown to the common \u2013 or even hardcore \u2013 baseball fan. He never played a single game in the major leagues, bouncing around the minors in Double-A and Single-A.\n\nMLB, PLAYERS' UNION REPORT POSITIVE TALKS ON OPIOIDS TESTING\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays selected Tingler in the 10th round of the MLB Draft. The former outfielder was in the Blue Jays\u2019 organization from 2003 to 2005 and never made it further than Class-A Advanced.\n\nHe joined the Rangers in 2006 and went as far as Double-A. He played in 389 minor league games overall, hitting .271 with a .701 OPS and three home runs.\n\nHe would then join the organization as the team's Dominican Summer League coach in 2007 and later be named manager in 2008 and 2009. He also managed the franchise's Rookie League affiliate and soon moved up the ranks of the front office from the coordinator of instruction of Arizona and Dominican operations to minor league field coordinator.\n\nHe interviewed for the Rangers job in 2018, but it was given to Chris Woodward.\n\nPadres general manager A.J. Preller was in the Rangers organization when Tingler was moving up. He was the director of international and professional scouting in 2004 and eventually worked up to be the assistant general manager before leaving for San Diego in 2014.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nTingler will now be called upon to lead the Padres out of the basement of the National League West.
