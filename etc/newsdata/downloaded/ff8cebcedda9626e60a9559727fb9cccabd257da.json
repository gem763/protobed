He said it had not been proven safe or effective and could confuse local populations already in parts mistrustful over Ebola.\n\nWHO 'too slow'\n\nOn Monday, medical charity Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) criticised the pace of ongoing inoculation, terming is \"too slow\".\n\n190922053618812\n\nMSF singled out the WHO for imposing \"tight controls on supply and eligibility criteria\" over Merck's product and said an independent committee should be created to oversee vaccination efforts instead.\n\nWHO's approach is centred on a so-called \"ring strategy\", whereby all people found to have come into contact with someone with a confirmed case of Ebola are given the vaccine.\n\nOn occasions, blanket \"targeted geographic vaccination\" of entire neighbourhoods deemed to be at high-risk from the virus, is also carried out rather than vaccinating only known contacts and contacts of contacts.\n\nAccording to MSF, between 450 000 and 600 000 people should have been immunised by now.\n\n\"Our capacity to carry out real-time assessments and react accordingly is severely undermined by a rigid system which is hard to comprehend,\" Natalie Roberts, MSF's emergency coordinator, said in a statement.\n\n\"Every day we see known contacts of confirmed Ebola patients who have not received their dose despite being eligible for vaccination.\n\n\"It's like giving firefighters a bucket of water to put out a fire, but only allowing them to use one cup of water a day.\"\n\nManaging the 'finite doses available'\n\nCommenting on MSF's criticisms, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the agency was carefully managing the \"finite number of doses available\".\n\n\"If all doses were sent to the DRC, there would be no reserves available to respond should cases emerge in any of the high-risk neighbouring countries,\" Jasarevic told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe added that an international committee, such as the one called for by MSF, could only be used to manage licensed vaccines.\n\nNeither Merck's nor Johnson & Johnson's Ebola vaccines are licensed.\n\n190819065038868\n\n\"When the vaccine is licensed, this would be an appropriate mechanism for managing supply,\" Jasarevic said.\n\nSo far, more than 3,000 people have been infected by Ebola during the current outbreak in DRC.\n\nEarlier this year, a handful of cases were confirmed in neighbouring Uganda after infected patients crossed the border.\n\nAll those affected either died or were sent back to DRC for specialised treatment.\n\nFears of a possible regional spread spiked again earlier this month after WHO criticised Tanzania for failing to share detailed information on suspected cases of the virus.\n\nOverall, the epidemic is the second worst of its kind, behind a 2013-16 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,300 people.\n\nWHO was heavily criticised for its sluggish response to the crisis in West Africa, which it repeatedly declined to declare a global emergency until the virus was spreading explosively.\n\nAdditional reporting by David Child: @DavidChild90", "description": "The WHO has confirmed the DRC will begin using a second Ebola vaccine as part of efforts to curtail the epidemic that has killed more than 2 000 people in the last 13 months.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7432/eee149c5c13642f7b7862b862934a067.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
