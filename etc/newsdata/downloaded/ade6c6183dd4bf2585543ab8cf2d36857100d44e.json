Some of them are in a panic over Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s claim during the last debate that the government was going to \u201ctake your AR-15.\u201d He decided to air this complaint during an interview on CNN Friday. (National Review)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Cory Booker on Friday criticized what he called \u201cfear-mongering\u201d about police showing up to confiscate legally owned assault-style weapons such as the AR-15 rifle. \u201cI hate when Democrats use the language that Republicans try to use to scare people away as opposed to the sort of pragmatism and practicality of this,\u201d the New Jersey senator said during an interview with CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen around this world, countries that have said enough of these assault rifles. They dealt with the problem that got them off of their streets. These weapons should not be in this country.\u201d Booker said he supports the policy proposed by fellow presidential contender Beto O\u2019Rouke, who made headlines during Thursday evening\u2019s Democratic debate for pledging, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nThis becomes even more humorous when you consider that Booker is already on record as supporting O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal of having a mandatory \u201cbuyback\u201d program. Just as a reminder for the senator, you can\u2019t \u201cbuy back\u201d something you didn\u2019t sell. Also, if it\u2019s mandatory, then it\u2019s not a buyback. It\u2019s gun confiscation.\n\nBut since Beto tossed out the idea and Booker supports it, the definition of \u201cfearmongering\u201d is apparently repeating something that you yourself said. Let\u2019s think for a moment about what such a program would look like and how it would work. You issue the mandate and anyone who feels inclined to obey goes and turns in their AR-15 and collects the money. But what about the \u201ccome and get it\u201d crowd?\n\nIf they don\u2019t show up, somebody will have to go collect the firearms from them. Who will be assigned to do that job? Will President Booker or President O\u2019Rourke be personally going around the country and knocking on doors to seize the weapons? Doubtful. Each jurisdiction would have to send out the police or the sheriffs to do it. And do you honestly think they\u2019re going to show up unarmed to attempt to seize weapons from an obstinate owner?\n\nIn other words, armed police officers will be showing up at people\u2019s doors to take their guns. That\u2019s not \u201cfearmongering.\u201d It\u2019s a description of what would have to happen.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t think the Democrats are serious about this, I would suggest you browse through an editorial from National Review. Yes, they are coming for your guns.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan has been endorsed in full by Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, and is now insinuating its way into the manifestos of gun-control groups nationwide. Presumably, this was O\u2019Rourke\u2019s intention. But he \u2014 and his party \u2014 would do well to remember that there is a vast gap between the one-upmanship and playacting that is de rigueur during primary season, and the harsh reality on the ground. Prohibition has never been well received in America, and guns have proven no exception to that rule. In New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey, attempts at the confiscation of \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines and the registration of \u201cassault weapons\u201d have both fallen embarrassingly flat \u2014 to the point that the police have simply refused to aid enforcement or to prosecute the dissenters.\n\nShould the Democrats actually bring this fever swamp dream to fruition, they will face a harsh dose of reality. There is very little appetite for confiscating legally purchased firearms from law-abiding citizens, even among the police and sheriffs who would be charged with enforcing the law. And in certain parts of the country, owners would likely become more than just \u201creluctant\u201d to comply. Do the Democratic hopefuls really want another Ruby Ridge on their hands?
