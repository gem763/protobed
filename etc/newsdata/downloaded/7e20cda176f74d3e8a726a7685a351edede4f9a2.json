A stream of green projectile vomit erupted from her mouth. This wasn\u2019t so much a Queen\u2019s speech as an exorcism. A desperate purge of the toxic waste that had been forced on her by a prime minister she had come to detest. A man who had already misled her over one prorogation and was now using her as a frontwoman to deliver an election manifesto. She had had her fair share of grubby moments during her time on the throne \u2013 the Ceau\u0219escu state visit being a case in point \u2013 but this was almost up there.\n\nThere was a large cluster of empty seats amid the ermine and tiaras from Claire\u2019s Accessories in the Lords. The sense of futility was too much even for some Tory peers. The Queen eyed up the gaps enviously. She\u2019d have given almost anything to have skipped the occasion herself. Anything but let Prince Charles have a go. Her son might be 70 but he still couldn\u2019t be trusted not to screw things up. Even an election stunt like this.\n\nBoris Johnson wins more backing from MPs for Brexit deal Read more\n\nThe Queen had looked both frail and furious as she sat down in her throne. Her eyes glanced over towards the TV screens as she waited for MPs to make their way over from the Commons. There was the prime minister trying to make small talk with Jeremy Corbyn. Good to see the Labour leader giving him the brush-off. At least he was good for something.\n\nHer Maj then looked up towards the visitors\u2019 gallery. Surely not? But it was. Stanley Johnson. You just couldn\u2019t escape a Johnson these days. Though surely Stanley was the Johnsons\u2019 prize Johnson. He was like Boris\u2019s shadow. How pathetic that he could exist only in the reflected, tainted glory of his son. He probably slept in his own basket next to Dilyn the dog, just outside Boris and Carrie\u2019s bedroom.\n\nThen the lord chancellor handed her the parchment and her professionalism kicked in. \u201cMy government,\u201d she began. My government, my arse. This wasn\u2019t her government. It wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s government. It was just a bunch of shits and charlatans, men and women for whom lying was second nature. That her reign should have come to this. She and the country surely deserved better. Though perhaps they didn\u2019t. Maybe the UK was on a one-way ticket to becoming a failed state.\n\nShe plodded on, making sure not to let the slightest hint of enthusiasm escape her lips. Not hard. This was a punishment beating for everyone. An exercise in utter existential nihilism. Even if Johnson meant a single word of it \u2013 something she rather doubted \u2013 there was no chance of any of it happening this side of a general election.\n\nSo the best she could hope for was to be back in the Lords in a couple of months\u2019 time, spouting the same old shit about providing dignity in old age and improving mental health provision. This from a man who had stripped a 93-year-old woman of her dignity and who had done more to damage the nation\u2019s mental health than any other politician. Once she had wrapped things up, she slipped a message to the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant to pick up the pace on the procession out. She needed a drink badly. Make it a double.\n\nTwo hours later the Commons was back in session to go through the charade of debating a Queen\u2019s speech that was never going to be implemented, while pretending the really serious business of the Brexit negotiations in Brussels wasn\u2019t happening. If this was a war, parliament would have been court martialed for dereliction of duty.\n\nAs is customary, two government backbenchers proposed and seconded the debate. These speeches are meant to be a chance to shine. To mix wit and personality with light-touch sincerity. But in Lee Rowley and Sarah Newton, the government had picked two MPs who are completely devoid of charm, barely capable of delivering a coherent sentence, let alone one that grips the imagination. Opera heroines have died a less agonising, less painful death.\n\nCorbyn spotted his opportunity to live down to the occasion. This was the most open of open goals. All he had to do was declare the debate a farce, deliver his own election manifesto, point out that Johnson had now embarrassed the Queen twice within a couple of months, and ask when he was planning on going for the hat-trick.\n\nInstead he rambled on, mistaking the Queen\u2019s speech as serious policy and getting hopelessly bogged down as he tried and failed to grapple with the lack of detail. No wonder some Labour MPs are now seriously thinking of waving through Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, however crap it turns out to be, and voting Conservative in the next election. Just to get rid of their leader.\n\nJohnson was no more impressive. Pifflepafflewifflewaffle. Rather, he was at his most loathsome. Arrogant and dismissive. Not even funny. Land of hopeless glory. Devoid of detail and morality as he indulged in petty point-scoring. A desperate blob interested more in his own survival than that of the country. As are nearly all Tory MPs. Principles that were once held sacred on both the leave and remain wings of the party are now up for grabs. Sold to the lowest bidder in return for a Brexit deal appreciably worse than Theresa May\u2019s that would make their constituents appreciably less well off.\n\nThis was an embarrassment. A parliament of all the talentless.
