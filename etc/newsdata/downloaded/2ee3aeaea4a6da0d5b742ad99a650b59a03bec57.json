While vitamin E is considered to be safe as a dietary or health supplement ingested in capsule or pill form, it can cause respiratory illness including pneumonia when inhaled.\n\nRob Di Pisa, co-chair of the Cannabis Law Group at law firm Cole Schotz, said the risk now is that \u201ceverything just gets lumped in together,\u201d meaning that consumers are conflating the products being sold in the black market for cannabis with the e-cigarettes that dispense strong doses of nicotine and have drawn the ire of regulators because of their popularity with young people.\n\n\u201cAnything related to cannabis and vaping cartridges are usually illegal and contain all kinds of pesticides that can create cyanide when they are inhaled,\u201d he said. \u201cThis all relates back to regulation and the need for it. If the black market is allowed to survive and there are no clear rules on what is permitted to go into cartridges that\u2019s safe for human consumption, this is what happens.\u201d\n\nVaping is a popular way of ingesting cannabis, because it doesn\u2019t smell like a traditional joint, he said. Many have sleek designs, which further appeal to young people.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sector is so volatile right now and it\u2019s really a shame to see it take additional hits,\u201d he said.\n\nIn case you missed it: Cannabis companies are having a horrible summer as scandals mount and stocks slide\n\nCannabis Watch: For all of MarketWatch\u2019s coverage of cannabis companies\n\nShares of accessories maker Greenlane Holdings Inc. GNLN, -8.59% fell 7.5% Monday and are down 59% in the last three months. Turning Point TPB, -1.84% was slightly lower, but has lost about 47% of its value in the last three months.\n\nElsewhere in the sector, a banking bill that would allow financial institutions do business with cannabis companies without fear of federal enforcement action is expected to be put to a vote in the House this week, according to advocacy site Marijuana Moment.\n\nThe bipartisan Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act cleared the Financial Services Committee back in March and will be put to a floor vote on Wednesday, according to the site. The continued federal ban on cannabis has made it risky for banks that are federally insured to serve the new legal cannabis sector, preventing companies from tapping capital markets.\n\nDiPisa said he still expects a banking bill to be the first major piece of legislation on the cannabis sector, but that states will likely seek more autonomy over their own markets than push for a lifting of the federal ban.\n\n\u201cIf each state creates its own regulations and manufacturing facilities, they won\u2019t want those jobs to relocate to the South or the Midwest where you have traditional farming because they would lose tax revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect either the SAFE Act or the STATES Act will be passed,\u201d he said referring to the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States (STATES) Act, a separate bill that would address the banking issue.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Key Republican sounds noncommittal on protecting banks that work with the marijuana industry\n\nGW Pharma stock GWPH, -1.49% rose 2.8%, after the company said the European Commission has granted approval for its cannabis-based drug Epidyolex for the treatment of seizures in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome, two severe types of childhood epilepsy.\n\nSee now: Justice Department poised to allow more marijuana to be grown for research\n\nThe drug, which is already approved in the U.S. under the brand name Epidiolex, will now be available to children of 2 years of age and older across Europe.
