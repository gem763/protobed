She's designed a line of clothing aimed at empowering unemployed women to find work.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex on Thursday launched the Smart Set capsule collection, in collaboration with Smart Works, a UK-based charity of which she is patron.\n\nBringing together leading British brands and fashion designers Jigsaw, John Lewis & Partners, Marks & Spencer and Misha Nonoo, the collection features work wear essentials and classic pieces which women need for interviews and the workplace.\n\nThe tote bag from the Duchess of Sussex's Smart Set capsule collection has already sold out on the John Lewis website.

During several quiet visits prior to her appointment, she observed that while donations to Smart Works were plentiful, the right choices or sizes were not always available.\n\nAddressing the small gathering at John Lewis on London's Oxford Street, Meghan said: \"When I first moved to the UK it was incredibly important to me personally to be able to connect with people on the ground doing really important work and one of the places that I went to very early on was SmartWorks.\"\n\nAfter meeting with them, the duchess said she asked herself: \"What can I do in some small way... how can I help amplify this?\"\n\nThe idea for the capsule collection came after a visit to the charity's London headquarters, she said, explaining: \"We had a lot of donations but not necessarily thing that women need to have. I said, 'ok, let's try to work with what we have and make the best of it.'\n\n\"And then the next time I went there was a rack of about 40 or 50 lilac blazers. Now don't get me wrong, it's a great blazer and I'm sure for someone it's exactly what she wants to be wearing but for most women, when you go in there and you want to have a job, interviewing, you want to feel confident, you want to be wearing the pieces ... that make you feel that way and not the leftovers that didn't sell from the end of the season.\n\n\"I kept thinking about it as I went home and it didn't track for me.\"\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex speaks at the launch of the Smart Works capsule collection in London.

That's charity as we know it today.\n\n\"Community is going through your closet and saying this is the blazer that I wore when I nailed my first job interview and got my dream job and I don't need that anymore because I'm where I want to be.\n\n\"But if I'm able to share that blazer and be part of another woman's success story then that's community.\"\n\nThe duchess said that in creating the collection, her friend Nonoo was her first port of call because of her experience in designing capsule collections and empowering women.\n\nShe then set out to select \"traditional and quintessential British brands\" in her \"new home\" which led her to choose M&S and John Lewis which -- surprisingly -- she admitted to \"wearing quite a bit in the last year or two.\"\n\nHer inspiration for working with Jigsaw, she said, came from a prior campaign that the chain had to use focusing on the diversity of the UK.\n\nAfter announcing that the bag had already sold out online, the duchess called upon her fashion partners to extend the range as much as possible to maximise the charity's gain.\n\nWrapping up her short but confident speech, Meghan said that the project was \"in the same vein of work that my husband and I will continue doing\" and promised to share about what lies ahead when their foundation, Sussex Royal, launches next year.\n\nNonoo, who was rumored to have introduced the royal couple, told CNN Style that the question of collaborating on the project was a \"no brainer.\"\n\nShe said: \"When the Duchess of Sussex approached me about being part of it when she became royal patron of Smart Works she obviously knew that what I do is very much about empowering women through their wardrobe and capsule collection is at the very heart of what I do, so it was a no brainer for me to say yes.\n\n\"The values were completely aligned with my own philosophy and values. She asked me to do the white shirt specifically because that's the signature of our collection.\"\n\nTweeting about the event, Smart Works quoted a client named only as \"Kate\" who has worn the collection already. The client said: \"My outfit made me feel like a boss -- powerful and strong. It just made me feel amazing, reminding me of how far I have come and the future I have in front of me.\"\n\nPhilippa Charles, a SmartWorks trustee, told CNN: \"SmartWorks is an amazing charity which helps women to find a job so we see ladies who have typically struggled to find employment. They are really trying hard and they basically need some support, so they see our incredible volunteers who help find them an amazing outfit so they feel absolutely fantastic.\n\n\"Then they get interview coaching, help with their CV and over half of them go on to get their job first time.\"", "description": "When it comes to fashion the Duchess of Sussex most certainly has the midas touch, with anything she wears in public usually selling out within hours.", "authors": ["Lianne Kolirin", "Ana Rosado"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190912102309-03-meghan-markle-0912-super-tease.jpg"}
