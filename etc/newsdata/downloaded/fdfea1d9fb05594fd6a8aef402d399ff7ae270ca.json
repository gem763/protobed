Writing that, all 42,000 verses of it, took the stuffing out of me. Darned of I\u2019m up to doing a follow-up.\n\nNarad Muni: Of course you can do a follow-up. Think of all the royalties you\u2019ll earn on it. And then they\u2019ll make a blockbuster TV series, like they did with the Ramayana, and you\u2019ll make even more royalties.\n\nValmiki: But what on earth am I supposed to write about? I\u2019ve said whatever I had to say in the Ramayan, where Ravana gets his lumps, largely thanks to the faithful Hanuman, and Sita gets herself swallowed up by Mother Earth, and Rama \u2013 who, just between you and me, I always thought of as a bit of a pompous prig, for all the talk of him being the Ideal Man \u2013 goes on to rule Ayodhya, with Luv and Kush. There\u2019s nothing more to say.\n\nNarad Muni: There\u2019s plenty more to say. And it\u2019s all waiting there, in front of all of us, for someone to say it.\n\nValmiki: What the dickens are you talking about?\n\nNarad Muni: I\u2019m talking about that ready-made epic that\u2019s just waiting out there to be written about in its entirety \u2013 I\u2019m talking about the legal mandir/masjid on-going century-old saga of Ayodhya, which we could call Ramayana II, and which would be a knockout chartbuster, maybe even outdoing the original Ramayana.\n\nValmiki: Give me a break, Narad. Just thinking about writing about that tangled mess and trying to make heads or tails of it gives me a headache. Not to mention writer\u2019s block. Get someone else to do it, not me.\n\nNarad Muni: Who, then. Rushdie, Arundhati, Amitav Ghosh?\n\nValmiki: Dunno. It\u2019ll have to be someone who can make sense out of nonsense, and nonsense out of sense.\n\nNewcomer (entering): Hi, there \u2013 Chetan Bhagat, at your service\u2026.", "description": "Valmiki conferring with his literary agent, Narad Muni.
