(Jemal Countess/Getty Images)\n\nColumnist\n\nIf Matt Lauer\u2019s response to a sexual assault accusation had been a wine, instead of just a whine, we\u2019d say it had an acidic bouquet of victim-blaming with a bitter aftertaste of self-pity.\n\nI find myself . . . frustrated by it, is the best word. Two days after he issued his much-dissected public letter, I still find myself frustrated. By its lack of self-reflection, sure. But mostly by how it drags us back into the Dark Ages of sexual assault discussions \u2014 the days when we assumed real rapists jumped out of bushes in ski masks, and anything else was just a woman scorned.\n\nWhat happened, if you\u2019re catching up: journalist Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d contains a shocking allegation that Lauer, the \u201cToday\u201d host fired in 2017 after multiple co-workers accused him of harassment, raped a young NBC producer in 2014. Brooke Nevils says Lauer invited her into his room while they were on a work assignment and there asked if she liked anal sex. She declined multiple times, Farrow writes, but Lauer proceeded anyway as Nevils \u201cwept silently into a pillow,\u201d then returned to her room bloody.\n\nLauer\u2019s long response, published in Variety, didn\u2019t deny the act \u2014 he admitted the anal intercourse \u2014 but rather, the coercion: \u201cShe was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSome readers found his explanation suspect. But for many it was exactly the defense they needed to exonerate a beloved television personality. \u201cFatal attraction,\u201d wrote one commenter. \u201cShe was dropped and very angry about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA case of a jilted lover getting revenge after he cut ties,\u201d wrote another.\n\n[Ronan Farrow overcame spies and intimidation to break some of the biggest stories of the #MeToo era]\n\nLauer\u2019s letter is an illustration of an impossible roadblock in our discussions about sexual assault: For a long time, women have been accused of \u201ccrying rape.\u201d But in the court of public opinion, there\u2019s no more potent get-out-of-jail-free card for an accused man than crying, \u201cconsensual sex!\u201d\n\nWhich is exactly what men from Kobe Bryant to Les Moonves to Matt Lauer have tried.\n\nRape? No, consensual sex!\n\nBruises? She liked it rough.\n\nSemen? She said I didn\u2019t need to wear a condom.\n\nWeeping? I think she might be kind of crazy, actually.\n\nA formal complaint, filed in the workplace or with police? Morning-after regrets! She felt guilty! She didn\u2019t want her boyfriend to know! She\u2019s trying to make me look bad. I\u2019m the victim here!\n\nThis last one was Lauer\u2019s overarching point. He was the victim here \u2014 and not only the victim of Nevils, but the victim of all the women who had accused him. These women had ruined his life, he essentially said, and now he was going to take them down with him. Or, as he actually put it rather ominously, \u201cAnd I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.\u201d\n\nTo those who were swayed by Lauer\u2019s protestations of innocence: Think about how rare it is for a rapist to say \u201cI raped someone.\u201d Or, think about this: Think about how it could have been possible for Lauer to genuinely believe that he, one of the most powerful big shots at NBC, was simply initiating spontaneous sex, while on a work trip, with a drunk junior colleague, who by her own account had consumed six shots of vodka at the bar with Lauer and others. And think about how \u2014 even if you don\u2019t believe her claims of being raped \u2014 that was still a very, very bad idea on his part. A fireable offense, even.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that Lauer and Nevils\u2019s interactions were simple. In the weeks following the alleged rape, Nevils had sex with Lauer again multiple times \u2014 contact that he called \u201can affair\u201d and she called \u201ctransactional\u201d because she now feared that refusing would jeopardize her job. As mind-boggling as it might seem, it\u2019s not uncommon for assault victims to carry on relationships with their perpetrators: as a means of self-preservation or as a form of magical thinking to take back some of the agency they lose in the assault. As a way to rationalize what happened, so they feel like less of a victim.\n\nIt\u2019s messy. It\u2019s unbelievably messy, as these situations often are. None of us will ever know with 100 percent certainty what happened in that hotel room.\n\nBut by crying \u201cconsensual sex,\u201d Matt Lauer is asking us to make it simple again. He\u2019s telling us: Don\u2019t have difficult conversations about consent or workplace power imbalances or victim psychology or the horrible moment when one person has simply given up on saying \u201cno,\u201d so the other person assumes it\u2019s now a \u201cyes.\u201d He\u2019s saying, let\u2019s just have a conversation about vindictive women and victimized men. She wanted it all \u2014 blame her.\n\nThe presumption of innocence is a bedrock of our judicial system. The accused are innocent until proven guilty. Which is exactly as it should be; nobody wants a scared teenager locked up because of hearsay evidence about a stolen TV. On the other hand, if there are fingerprints and cellphone records, and if the owner of the television is saying, \u201cThat\u2019s the guy who took my flat-screen\u201d \u2014 well, then, a jury will probably convict.\n\nBut when the accused\u2019s immediate default is \u201cconsensual sex,\u201d our discussions get stuck. A victim can produce fingerprints, and her attacker can say\u201d \u201cOf course those are my fingerprints. I never said we didn\u2019t have sex.\u201d A victim can point to an attacker and say, \u201cThat\u2019s the guy,\u201d and the guy can say, \u201cSure, I\u2019m the guy, but it was consensual.\u201d\n\nCrying \u201cconsensual sex!\u201d means that he says something, and she says something, and we immediately fall back on believing him.\n\nMaybe you think this how it should be, because you think that women, overwhelmingly, are lying. Or maybe this outcome doesn\u2019t sit well with you, but you can\u2019t figure out a way around it. Because even if you sense she\u2019s telling the truth, it can\u2019t be proved. So we preserve the status quo. And we never get any better at these conversations.\n\nSince the publication of Lauer\u2019s letter, reports have come out about Brooke Nevils\u2019s life in the past several years. In Farrow\u2019s book, she describes falling into a depression, being hospitalized for post-traumatic stress and alcohol abuse. Sources have said that she feels terrible for not speaking up sooner, and she blamed herself for what happened.\n\nI understand the impulse for this kind of agonized self-reflection. It\u2019s too bad Lauer doesn\u2019t seem to have engaged in it, too.\n\nNo, women are not always victims. But I wish we didn\u2019t so often default to believing that men are.\n\nREAD MORE: by Monica Hesse:\n\nRead more by Monica Hesse:\n\nBrett Kavanaugh and the terrible, lingering price of his denials\n\nWhy should we trust a man who harassed women to cover the historically female 2020 race?\n\nWe can\u2019t let go of the Al Franken question.
