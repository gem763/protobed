(File photo)\n\nTwo support workers are needed around the clock to help him deal with his outbursts and although he started at a mainstream school, he was excluded almost daily.\n\nHe now attends a specialist school with his own support workers. At home, his father cares for him as well as his mother, who uses a wheelchair.\n\nHis mother and father were accused by health and social workers of being bad parents for almost five years before a court ruled that his birth injuries are a significant factor behind his behaviour.\n\nProblems at his birth included sepsis, seizures and persistent pulmonary hypertension, or high blood pressure in the arteries supplying the lungs.\n\nMedical evidence backed up claims that his difficult behaviour was down to these injuries and University College Hospital eventually admitted liability.\n\nJudge Graham Robinson approved a settlement in excess of \u00a330million at the High Court on Monday to fund the boy's care.\n\nJane Weakley, a partner at Fieldfisher, the law firm that argued the case, said: 'We instructed independent medical experts, including a paediatric neuropsychiatrist, and a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder was made, which he wouldn't have had but for the brain injury, plus ADHD which he probably would have had anyway but which the brain injury made more severe.\n\nThe boy's emergency caesarean section was delayed as a result of negligence at University College Hospital in London in June 2012\n\n'Our case was that it is impossible to divide up his injury \u2013 that is, to attribute certain behaviours to the injury and others to factors such as his environment.\n\n'Without this vital diagnosis, this child would have continued to be considered as badly behaved, with blame focusing partly on genetics, partly on his living environment, whereas in fact, mistakes and delays during his birth meant he was deprived of oxygen which left him brain injured.'\n\nShe added: 'I'm extremely pleased that this settlement for life will allow his family to provide the best possible care.'\n\nThe boy's mother said: 'It has been an incredibly stressful time. We have some peace of mind knowing that our son will be supported for the rest of his life.'\n\nUniversity College London Hospitals Trust said: 'We are very sorry that this young person suffered a brain injury at birth in 2012 due to a delay in delivery.\n\n'We are pleased that... we reached a settlement with the family.'", "description": "A seven-year-old boy, from  London, who was labelled 'naughty' in school for his behaviour, has been awarded \u00a330million due to the brain injury he was left with as a baby from hospital blunders.", "authors": ["Jake Hurfurt For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/21/20397868-0-image-a-3_1572471482877.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
