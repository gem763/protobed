Mr Taylor's office gave the document to the media and claimed the council had spent over $15 million on travel and attacked mayor Clover Moore for hypocrisy on climate change. The real figure was less than $6,000, which has raised questions about where Taylor's office sourced the document. Labor has referred the matter to NSW police. Mr Taylor has confirmed he will send a letter to Moore apologising for \"getting the figures wrong\" but refused three times to be drawn further.
