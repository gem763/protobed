The withdrawal needs the approval of the Legislative Council, which is not expected to oppose Lam.\n\nThe bill would have allowed extraditions to mainland China where courts are controlled by the Communist Party. Its withdrawal is a key demand of protesters but just one of five. The move came after pitched battles across the former British colony of 7 million. More than 1,000 protesters were arrested.\n\nMany are furious about perceived police brutality and the number of arrests and want an independent inquiry.\n\n\"The government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,\" Lam said.\n\n\"I pledge that the government will seriously follow up the recommendations of the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Council) report. From this month, I and my principal officials will reach out to the community to start a direct dialogue ... we must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions.\"\n\nThe protests began in March but snowballed in June and have evolved into a push for greater democracy for the city which returned to China in 1997. It was not clear if killing the bill would help end the unrest. The immediate reaction appeared skeptical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"FIVE DEMANDS, NOT ONE MISSING\"\n\nSome lawmakers said the move should have come earlier.\n\n\"The damage has been done. The scars and wounds are still bleeding,\" said pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo. \"She thinks she can use a garden hose to put out a hill fire. That's not going to be acceptable.\"\n\nMany people on street corners after nightfall were shouting: \"Five demands, not one missing.\"\n\n\u201cWe still have four other demands. We hope people won\u2019t forget that,\" said a woman speaking for the protest movement who declined to identify herself except by the surname Chan. \"The mobilization power won\u2019t decrease.\"\n\nRiot police fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray on Tuesday to clear demonstrators from outside the Mong Kok police station and in Prince Edward metro station, with one man taken out on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face, television footage showed.\n\nThe four other demands are: retraction of the word \"riot\" to describe rallies, release of all demonstrators, an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders.\n\n\"Too little, too late,\" Joshua Wong, a leader of pro-democracy protests in 2014 that were the precursor to the current unrest, said on his Facebook page.\n\nIn the United States, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a persistent critic of what he sees as Beijing's attempts to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, called Lam's move \"welcome but insufficient.\"\n\n\"The Chinese Communist Party should uphold its commitments to Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and stop aggravating the situation with threats of violence,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi called the move long overdue and demanded an end to the use of force against demonstrators. Pelosi said she looked forward to the swift advance of bipartisan legislation to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong.\n\nRubio has co-sponsored a Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act that would require annual certification of Hong Kong's autonomy to justify special treatment the territory enjoys under U.S. law.\n\nIn an op-ed in the Washington Post on Tuesday, Rubio said the United States and the rest of the world needed to make clear to China that aggression toward Hong Kong risked \"swift, severe and lasting consequences.\"\n\nHe said the U.S. administration should make clear it could respond \"flexibly and robustly,\" including with sanctions against the police force and individuals responsible for abuses. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests so the Chinese-ruled city can move forward from a \"highly vulnerable and dangerous\" place and find solutions.
