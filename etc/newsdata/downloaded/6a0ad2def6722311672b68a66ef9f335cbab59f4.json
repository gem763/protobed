The second-quarter decline in global trade volumes, coupled with the decline in JPMorgan's global manufacturing export index in August, led the company to predict a decline in trade volumes this year, Carere said.", "description": "FedEx sounded the alarm on the US economy during its first-quarter earnings call this week.
