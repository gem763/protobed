They will move as one, like a flock of birds, so long as each fish stays in line with the fish that surround it.\n\nModern fish, as well as other kinds of animals, already know how to move as one. But unraveling when in Earth\u2019s deep past this behavior evolved has been a tough fish to fry for scientists.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult, for instance, to find evidence of schooling fish in the fossil record. You need just the right circumstances to fossilize something like a school of fish in place within a rock. Then, that rock has to survive intact long enough for a paleontologist to discover it and study it.\n\nBut that is just what may have happened.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]", "description": "A slab of rock and the methods used to study it could offer clues to when a behavior common in fishes first evolved.", "authors": ["Lucas Joel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/04/science/29TB-FISHFOSSIL1/29TB-FISHFOSSIL1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-29"}
