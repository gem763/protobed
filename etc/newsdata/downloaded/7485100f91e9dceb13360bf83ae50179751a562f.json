(AP) - In a week in which one of his 2004 draft classmates suffered a season-ending elbow injury and the other was benched, Philip Rivers continues to be old reliable for the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nRivers will make his 209th consecutive start on Sunday when the Chargers host the Houston Texans in a key early season matchup. That ties him with Eli Manning for the second-longest QB starting streak in NFL history.\n\nManning, who was the No. 1 pick in the 2004 draft, was benched this week by the Giants for rookie Daniel Jones and Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, the No. 11 overall selection, will miss the rest of the season with an elbow injury.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you ever take it for granted, no question. I think even more-so now, you just realize that it doesn\u2019t last forever,\u201d Rivers said.\n\nLongevity though is not what Rivers is focusing on this week. It is trying to bounce back from a disappointing 13-10 loss at Detroit where the Chargers\u2019 hope for a comeback ended when he threw an interception in the end zone late in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe pick capped a day that saw the Chargers have two touchdowns called back because of penalties, two missed field goals and a turnover in the red zone. The loss leaves LA at 1-1 and facing a fellow playoff participant from last season.\n\n\u201cI think that we\u2019ve shown the ability to bounce back over the years when we\u2019ve lost some tough ones,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cUsually, you never take any satisfaction in losing, obviously, but most of our losses are going to be tough ones - at least I hope.\u201d\n\nRivers is very much a pocket passer who is not fleet of foot, Deshaun Watson is the opposite. The third-year quarterback is two touchdown passes away from 50 in his career and needs 35 rushing yards to become the seventh QB in NFL history with 900 yards or more in his first 26 games.\n\nWhile the Chargers are coming off a close loss, the Texans survived a missed 2-point conversion to beat Jacksonville 13-12.\n\n\u201cEveryone is making sure that as far as I go, the offense goes and the whole team goes,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt just kind of grows on itself and the more I play, the more reps I get, the more games I start as a quarterback here, the more it grows.\u201d\n\nHere is what else to watch for during Sunday\u2019s game:\n\nSTILL RUNNING WELL\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been any decline in the Chargers\u2019 running game despite Melvin Gordon\u2019s holdout. Austin Ekeler and Justin Jackson have combined to average 5.7 yards per carry.\n\nEkeler leads the AFC in scrimmage yards (287) and is tied for sixth in the league in offensive touches (46). However, he did fumble near the goal line in last Sunday\u2019s 13-10 loss to Detroit.\n\nJackson has been a nice change-of-pace back with seven of his 13 carries going for 10 yards or more.\n\nWITHOUT MERCY\n\nHouston outside linebacker Whitney Mercilus was the AFC Defensive Player of the Week this week after he had two sacks, forced two fumbles and had two quarterback hits in a win over the Jaguars last Sunday. His second strip sack was recovered by J.J. Watt and the Texans scored their only touchdown of the game four plays later. Mercilus is the only player in the NFL to force more than one fumble this season.\n\nIt was his second straight big game this season after he had a sack, an interception, five tackles, including one for a loss and a quarterback hit in Houston\u2019s opener.\n\n\u201cWhitney has been a very productive player for us over the years,\u201d coach Bill O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a guy that really is just known for doing his job. He just does a good job of setting the edge in the running game and then rushing the passer.\u201d\n\nFILLING IN\n\nRunning backs Carlos Hyde and Duke Johnson have filled in nicely in the first two games after Lamar Miller, who was Houston\u2019s featured back for the past three seasons, sustained a season-ending knee injury in a preseason game. The duo has helped the Texans average 153 yards rushing a game, which ranks fifth in the NFL. Hyde has carried a bigger load than Johnson so far and he is fifth in the league with 173 yards rushing.\n\nTheir success is impressive considering that neither player started camp with the team. Johnson came to Houston in a trade with Cleveland on Aug. 9 and Hyde joined the Texans on Aug. 31 in a deal with Kansas City.\n\nPASS RUSHERS ON PARADE\n\nThe game will feature three of the top pass rushers in the AFC. Houston\u2019s J.J. Watt is still looking for his first sack this season and has never taken down Rivers.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram have combined for two sacks, both coming in the opener against Indianapolis.\n\nKICKING WOES\n\nThe Chargers are hoping to get placekicker Michael Badgley back after he has missed two games because of a groin injury. Ty Long has handled both kicking and punting duties, but missed a pair of field-goal attempts last week.\n\nThe Texans have brought back punter Bryan Anger after Trevor Daniel struggled.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In a week in which one of his 2004 draft classmates suffered a season-ending elbow injury and the other was benched, Philip Rivers continues to be old reliable for the Los Angeles Chargers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Reedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/chargers_lions_football_89612_c0-144-3451-2156_s1770x1032.jpg?3f41058e8b0fa3801681c846074da4f3d0a82c4c", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
