What was at stake makes Bielsa\u2019s act of sportmanship all the more remarkable.\u201d\n\nBielsa\u2019s decision to allow Aston Villa to equalise came after the visiting manager, Dean Smith and his assistant John Terry had remonstrated with him at length.\n\n\u201cI suggested I thought that would be the right thing to do and he agreed. But I\u2019m not sure all his players did,\u201d Smith said afterwards. \u201cI can understand their frustration but full respect to Marcelo for that because it was the right decision.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marcelo Bielsa instructs Pontus Jansson to allow Aston Villa to equalise in the game at Elland Road.

English football is known around the world for its noble features. I\u2019ve said all I want to say.\u201d\n\nThe 64-year-old experienced an eventful first season in English football, missing out on promotion via the play-offs, which were won by Aston Villa. Earlier in the season, Bielsa admitted to sending someone to spy on Derby County after a man was apprehended by police outside the Rams\u2019 training ground.\n\nThe Fiver | The possibility of a petulant diva strop is always on the cards Read more\n\nIn response to the growing \u201cSpygate\u201d furore, Bielsa held an extraordinary press conference, in which he admitted to spying on every Championship opponent that season. \u201cI observed all the rivals we played against and watched the training sessions of all opponents,\u201d Bielsa said. \u201cAlthough not illegal, it\u2019s not necessarily the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe club were fined \u00a3200,000 and given a severe reprimand by the EFL. Leeds then lost to Derby in the play-off semi-finals, but Bielsa agreed to return as manager for another season \u2013 although Jansson was promptly sold to Brentford.\n\nPrevious winners of the Fifa Fair Play award include Paolo Di Canio, Lucas Radebe, Gary Lineker and Bobby Robson.
