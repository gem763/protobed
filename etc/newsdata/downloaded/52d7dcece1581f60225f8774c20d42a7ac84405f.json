Aramco\u2019s Long-Awaited IPO May Be Kryptonite to Saudi Stocks\n\n(Bloomberg) -- It\u2019s been at least three years in the making, but it\u2019s just dawned on investors what a share sale by Saudi Aramco would do to the Arab world\u2019s biggest stock exchange.\n\nThe Tadawul All Share Index almost wiped out this year\u2019s gains after the kingdom\u2019s efforts to line up banks for the sale spurred market players to realize the initial public offering really is happening. About 90% of the index\u2019s stocks fell.\n\n\u201cAll local index constituencies should suffer outflows,\u201d said Slava Breusov, a senior analyst with the emerging and frontier equities team at AllianceBernstein in New York.\n\nThe IPO is part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s efforts to modernize the economy and diversify the nation\u2019s revenue from oil, including turning the bourse into a gateway for foreign investment. The kingdom spent years relaxing rules for foreign traders and aligning its market with global peers, culminating in its inclusion in MSCI Inc. and Russell\u2019s developing-nations equity benchmarks.\n\nThe world\u2019s most profitable company is planning a listing in Riyadh, and potentially another internationally, although the timings of either haven\u2019t been announced. The energy giant is considering first selling around a 1% stake through a listing on the Saudi stock exchange, with the possibility of offering another 1% on the local bourse at a later date, one person with knowledge of the matter said.\n\n\u201cBarring some sort of liquidity injection by the Saudi government, I would expect an Aramco local listing to be a drain on the rest of the market as Aramco\u2019s behemoth size crowds out other local investments,\u201d said Adam Choppin, an investment officer at FIS Group in Philadelphia.\n\nThe index fell as much as 2.5% as of 2:01 p.m. in Riyadh.\n\nWhat It\u2019s Worth\n\nPrince Mohammed in 2016 valued Aramco at about $2 trillion, which means floating 1% would be valued at about $20 billion. That would account for about 4% of the market. To be sure, Bloomberg Intelligence values Aramco at $1.1 trillion because of the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will need to limit its output, and other analysts have said about $1.5 trillion. at about $60 a barrel isn\u2019t enough to fund the the kingdom\u2019s budget, which needs prices at $80 a barrel or more.\n\nBut even if Aramco\u2019s worth is lower than the kingdom\u2019s estimates, it would still dwarf other equities. Its profit in the first half of the year was more than four times the combined earnings of 170 Saudi publicly traded companies that reported earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAnd assuming the company\u2019s valuation is about $1.5 trillion, a 1% listing would put Aramco at 5.2% of the main stock index, according to Mohamad Al Hajj, an equities strategist at EFG-Hermes in Dubai. That would dilute the dominance of other market heavyweights, such as Al Rajhi Bank, which currently accounts for 15% of the index. The equity would receive roughly $1.9 billion in inflows from MSCI and passive trackers alone, almost a tenth of total foreign inflows into the Saudi bourse so far this year.\n\n\u201cConsidering the size of Aramco\u2019s IPO and its expected weight in indexes, the company will have a significant effect not only on the local gauge, but also on global indexes,\u201d said AllianceBernstein\u2019s Breusov.", "description": "Aramco\u2019s Long-Awaited IPO May Be Kryptonite to Saudi Stocks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECAK0NT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
