Despite his referendum defeat, Cameron\u2019s stock then remained relatively high, even if the figure paled in comparison to the reported \u00a34.6m earned by Tony Blair for his book.\n\nWith the UK mired in Brexit-related culture wars and teetering on the edge of a potential no-deal departure from the EU in six weeks\u2019 time, the same industry figure suggested the timing of the book\u2019s release could not be worse, viewing the publication as an ordeal that HarperCollins would need to \u201cget over and done with\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the events will be hard to manage in that he\u2019ll be heckled, it\u2019ll be very hard for him to get through the Brexit part of the discussions. It\u2019ll just be a massive struggle,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest For the Record has been languishing in the charts on preorders.

Some independent bookshops say they will not be stocking the \u00a325 hardback, often out of deference to left-leaning or remain-backing customers. In the eyes of many, the chaos of the last three years will forever be linked to the hubris of the Etonian former Tory leader.\n\n\u201cWe will probably get one or two people asking for it but I\u2019m not going to make a big thing \u2013 we might get firebombed,\u201d said Jane Howe, the owner of the Broadway Bookshop in Hackney.\n\nAnother indicator is pre-orders: the bookranked as low as 335 in the Amazon charts as recently as Thursday. Such a position suggests it may be on course for sales closer to those of Gordon Brown\u2019s My Life, Our Times than Blair\u2019s A Journey, which shifted more than 10 times as many copies as Brown\u2019s in its first seven weeks.\n\nAs for style, one might expect For the Record to fall somewhere between the density of Brown\u2019s book and the breeziness of Blair\u2019s, which curled toes with one particularly purple passage of a sexual nature. Reportedly based on 53 hours of recordings from monthly meetings Cameron held with the Times columnist and Conservative peer Daniel Finkelstein, it was originally slated for the publication last year but publishers are said to have demanded a 100,000-word cut.\n\nA more optimistic vision of how it will fare was offered by James Daunt, the Waterstones chief executive, who said the chain was hoping it might fill an \u201cObama-shaped\u201d hole in its political biography section.\n\n\u201cOur early indications are that it is going to be extremely popular. It looks as if it\u2019s going to be really a big publishing event, although until we see it and have it in our shops we are not going to truly know,\u201d he said. He described the interest in pre-orders both online and in-store as \u201cstrong\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is clearly interest but political biographies are quite febrile things. Some take off and some fall flat and it\u2019s not always because of the content. At the end of the day, if the Guardian, the Times and others have reviews that reinforce expectations among some that this really does explain things then we will sell a lot.\u201d\n\nOf significance too will be the reaction to a serialisation this weekend in the Times, part of the same Murdoch-owned media universe as HarperCollins.\n\nOverall it\u2019s a tightly controlled publicity schedule. The only events on the calendar are An Evening with David Cameron, at a yet-to-be-revealed central London location on 6 October, and an interview by the BBC\u2019s Sophie Raworth at the Times-sponsored Cheltenham literature festival a day earlier. Conspicuously absent are bookshop signings of the sort where irate members of the public could show up, although the timing of another, lesser noticed event on 1 October in Washington DC may be significant.\n\nCameron will appear on the campus of George Washington University for an event that will \u201cprovide, for the first time, his perspective on the EU referendum and his views on the future of Britain\u2019s place in the world following Brexit,\u201d the advance notice states. Meanwhile, 3,537 miles away at the Tory party conference, his fellow Conservatives will be grappling with the turmoil from a still-undelivered process.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson and David Cameron in 2012.

An added twist to the intrigue about what Cameron will say about Boris Johnson is provided by political whispers that he backed Jeremy Hunt over his one-time fellow Bullingdon Club member to be Tory leader.\n\nThere is no shortage of potentially explosive questions. For example, will Cameron opine on whether the referendum result did or did not give a mandate for a no-deal Brexit? At least one person who has discussed the book with Cameron suggests there may well be fireworks.\n\n\u201cI have talked to him about it a little bit and my impression is that it will be quite a revealing book,\u201d said Iain Dale, the broadcaster and political commentator. He said a poignant aspect of the book would be Cameron remembering his son Ivan, who had severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy and died at the age of six. Charities working with disabled children are among those set to benefit from the book\u2019s profits.\n\n\u201cHe is not somebody who I think will want to write all-out attacks on people but there are also some very human stories that he will have to address \u2013 his relationship with Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, for example. I suspect that will be one of the most difficult chapters to write.\u201d\n\nOf course, any difficulties in writing about his relations with the two most prominent cabinet ministers to declare for the leave campaign are likely to be trumped by the challenges of addressing Brexit at its most brute level.\n\nWhile cautioning against expecting any mea culpa, Dale added: \u201cHe will know that history will remember him for the Brexit referendum. Every prime minister is remembered for one thing in a sense, even if they may have done an awful lot else.\u201d", "description": "Preorders appear sluggish and some shops in remain-voting areas say they won\u2019t stock memoir", "authors": ["Ben Quinn", "Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03b92c4f8e2eeb1d7c7a9d15f0bf5dc1008d4568/181_76_1832_1099/master/1832.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=566bd81568fca86754eb388f76a2110d", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
