Taking on somebody who\u2019s undefeated, up and coming and who has a style that can really shut you down and even if you win against him, not a lot of guys are going to look good.\u201d\n\nGillespie (13-0 MMA, 6-0 UFC) has run through competition so far in his UFC tenure, but Lee will be his highest-profile fight to date. \u201cThe Motown Phenom\u201d knows that Gillespie has a lot more to gain from this fight, but is excited to be going up against this caliber of an opponent, even if he\u2019s relatively unknown to the general public.\n\n\u201cGoing against that type of style, he\u2019s a more decorated wrestler than anybody in the division,\u201d Lee said. \u201cSo there are a lot of factors that come into play, and again I\u2019m coming off two losses, and I remember that too. That\u2019s something that\u2019s in the back of my head. He\u2019s undefeated, he\u2019s never even tasted that before so it\u2019s definitely one where my back is against the wall. It\u2019s not a whole lot to gain but that\u2019s the types of fight where I rise to the occasion.\u201d\n\nLee, who\u2019s had struggles with his cut down to 155 pounds, decided to make the move up to welterweight in his last fight. He took on former lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos, and ended up losing via fourth-round submission in May.\n\nBut Lee never thought about a tune-up fight to try and get back into the win column. He wanted to bounce back with a tough test. Gillespie is exactly the type of opponent Lee was looking for, and the fight ended up fitting perfectly into his desired date to return.\n\n\u201cFor me it was about just getting in there and competing,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAnd to compete against somebody who\u2019s really good. Not just getting in there, oh let me just make some money and let me get my feet wet and fight somebody like a Diego Sanchez or something like that. I want toughest guys that they could possibly find and it worked out perfect. Gregor\u2019s from New York, we\u2019re going to take this fight in Madison Square Garden, biggest arena in New York.\u201d\n\nAnd for someone who\u2019s always wanted to face lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, Gillespie could be the fight to prove that Lee has the style to beat Nurmagomedov.\n\nBut Lee will leave that up for the fans to decide. He wants to let his fighting do the talking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave this for the people to decide,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI think Gregor is the most decorated wrestler at 155, way more decorated than even Khabib was so I\u2019ll leave that for the people. They\u2019ll see the fight, they\u2019ll see how it\u2019s going to go. It\u2019s so hard trying to fight a guy that\u2019s really trying to take you down and really skilled at it too so after this fight, I\u2019ll let the people see what they see and see how we match up.\u201d\n\nWith the undefeated Nurmagomedov having ran through the majority of the top contenders at lightweight, Lee thinks a win over Gillespie would put him in a prime position.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s not a lot of opponents for Khabib at 155,\u201d Lee said. \u201cEspecially after he gets past Tony Ferguson so after this fight, I\u2019m going to show everybody that there\u2019s a new challenger on the block for sure.\u201d\n\nAnd in what looks like an intriguing grappler vs. grappler fight on paper, Lee says it won\u2019t necessarily go down that way. All he knows, is he plans on making a statement on Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to beat the hell out of him at the end of the day,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a wrestling match, it\u2019s not going to be see how many points you score versus \u2013 no, I\u2019m going out there to hurt the man so that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s on my mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to remind everybody who\u2019s the next up at 155 for sure. This is that fight. This is win big, or go home, and my back\u2019s against the wall so I\u2019m coming out swinging.\u201d", "description": "Kevin Lee admits that taking the Gregor Gillespie fight at UFC 244 might not be that smart, but it's a challenge he wants anyway.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Dan Tom", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Simon Head", "The Blue Corner", "Abbey Subhan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/kevin-lee-edson-barboza-ufc-fight-night-128-5.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
