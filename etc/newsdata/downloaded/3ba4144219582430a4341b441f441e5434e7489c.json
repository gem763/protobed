At 77, he won\u2019t even be the oldest in the field, and the billionaire is certainly not short of funding to be able to throw his hat in the ring.\n\nOver the past several weeks, he\u2019s signaled renewed interest in the democratic nomination, telling friends and associates he\u2019s \u201cstill looking at\u201d running for president. But he has cautioned he\u2019d only join the race if former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s faltering centrist campaign takes a decisive hit or pulls out early in primary season, according to a report by CNBC.\n\nBiden\u2019s collapse would likely leave Elizabeth Warren as frontrunner, a liberal candidate with whom he has repeatedly clashed over her anti-corporate policies and fears she will push the party too far to the left and eliminate the chance of a Democratic candidate unseating Donald Trump next year.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s disagreements with Warren are stark. In January, when he was considering a run for president, he described Warren\u2019s wealth tax proposals in extreme terms .\n\nRelated: The Many Lives of Michael Bloomberg review: not quite a presidential read\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about our system,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to look at a system that\u2019s not capitalistic, just take a look at what was perhaps the wealthiest country in the world and now people are starving to death. It\u2019s called Venezuela.\u201d\n\nMore recently, at an anti-gun event in Iowa hosted by the Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, a group Bloomberg founded and supports, he was again asked about Warren\u2019s wealth tax proposals.\n\n\u201cI just said to Senator Warren on the way out, \u2018Senator, congratulations, it\u2019s a nice talk. But let me just remind you if my company hadn\u2019t been successful, we wouldn\u2019t be here today, so enough with this stuff\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s attitude to wealth is diametrically opposed to Warren, whose criticisms of the financial sector\u2019s excesses are legion. Before he ever ran for New York mayor, his company threw a party in London complete with entertainers \u2013 representing avarice \u2013 instructed to wave bundles of cash and shout: \u2018Money, ain\u2019t it gorgeous?\u2019\n\nForbes recently put his wealth at $51bn.\n\nBloomberg has previously flirted with presidential ambitions, but he decided not to run in 2016 after concluding he might split the Democratic vote. It is not clear that dynamic has changed, nor whether Democratic primary voters really have the taste for a billionaire candidate.\n\nBut others see a possible centrist path to the White House.\n\n\u201cThe reality is both parties, Republican and Democrat, are in serious trouble, they are not functioning, and they\u2019ve gone to extremes,\u201d says veteran strategist Hank Sheinkopf. \u201cCould Mike Bloomberg unite the centre of the party and bring people to the center if he can prove he can win? The answer is yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBloomberg has up-top professionals ready if he needs them, and he could assemble an operation in days and go to work. Whether the Democrats like him as centrist or not, they want to win the White House. He provides an extraordinary alternative to losing.\u201d\n\nPeople familiar with Bloomberg\u2019s thinking says his aims are clear \u2013 and they\u2019re grouped neatly as gun control, climate change, coal, education and health.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t talk about his five points more. If he happens to mention something about the presidency at a cocktail party and they get talked about more, that\u2019s a good thing for him,\u201d one source said.\n\nStrengthening the rumor mill is Bloomberg\u2019s appointment of his former deputy Patti Harris to his company\u2019s management committee. Harris has been at the company since 1994. As Bloomberg\u2019s deputy during his three terms as New York mayor, Harris was regarded, in personal and political terms, as the keeper of the Bloomberg brand, his personal gate keeper and point person on all strategic and staffing decisions.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most important person in his life and director of all his political aspiration,\u201d says the source. \u201cIf you believe in this line of gossip, putting Harris in to run the company frees him up to run for president. You can argue that he\u2019s setting himself up to do something.\u201d\n\nWhen Bloomberg was last considering a run, almost exactly a year ago, a Quinnipiac University poll found he had an overall unfavorable rating of 32%, and 19% of Democrats viewed him negatively.", "description": "The former New York mayor\u2019s attitude towards wealth is staunchly opposite Elizabeth Warren\u2019s, with whom he\u2019s repeatedly clashedMichael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, is teasing a presidential run if former vice-president Joe Biden were to fall back.
