Amid this, if a certain character manages to stay with you it definitely means that the makers did something right. More often than not, it\u2019s not the protagonists or antagonists but a side character that catches the fancy of audiences.\n\nThe credit not only goes to the writers but even to the artists, for they bring such good energy to the characters that they make a mark in the hearts of the viewers even if they get a lesser screen time in comparison to the leads.\n\nA very apt example of the same has to be Katekar, Sartaj Singh\u2019s sidekick in Sacred Games. You would be lying if you didn\u2019t flinch when he got killed in that freak attack!\n\nTo celebrate characters just like him, here\u2019s a list of 11 characters that won our hearts and then some. Check it out!\n\n1. Stranger Things\n\nDUSTIN\n\nWell, Stranger Things came into our lives, some 2-3 years ago and became an integral part of our conversations and discussions, it would be wrong to single out one character as the lead, as the entire bunch plays an important role in their own regard. While i do love eleven as much as the next person, it\u2019s Dustin and his crooked smile that turns my heart to mush! From his toothless smile to his whacky hairdo, there\u2019s nothing that i don\u2019t love about him. Plus, his level-headed nature and fierce protectiveness for his group is adorable beyond words, isn\u2019t it?\n\nDon't Miss 221 SHARES 12.1 K SHARES 548 SHARES 938 SHARES\n\n2. Bojack Horseman\n\nDIANE\n\nThis is one show that most of us relate to even though it revolves around a horse. Why you ask? Well, because this is perhaps the only show that deals with real stuff ie mental health. This show is based on depression, where BoJack gets the maximum screen time yet it is Diane Nguyen whose character aptly projects clinical depression. Not only does the character has issues but even the emotional behaviour that she portrays is spot on. From melancholy, rage to maniacal outbursts, Diane\u2019s temperament represents modernity with full precision.\n\n3. The Good Place\n\nJANET\n\nI still remember I discovered this show while randomly surfing the net, bored out of my wits and when I started watching the show it felt like I had hit the jackpot. While Kristen Bell, of course is super entertaining and so is Chidi and the others, it\u2019s Janet who steals the show in every scene she stars in. The provider and the source of knowledge for the people in the good place, she\u2019s robotic yet oozes dry humour and her endearing qualities are hard not to fawn upon.\n\n4. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\n\nNICK\n\nThe dystopian drama that started a wave, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale has a lot of strong characters and it\u2019s hard to pick just one. However, one character that is everyone\u2019s favourite is Nick. The father of June\u2019s child and her saviour. His brooding look and patient personality makes most single ladies crave for a man just like him. He lets his woman June be and take her own decisions, yet he has a voice of his own.\n\n5. Suits\n\nLOUIS LITT\n\nYou just got Litt - Don\u2019t call yourself a Suits fan, if you don\u2019t know this catch phrase!\n\nIf you are an avid fan of the show Suits then you won\u2019t even waste a wink in agreeing to this one. He started off as the most annoying character you wouldn\u2019t want to cross paths with but as the seasons progressed so did Louis Litt. He made his way in our hearts to never go back. Ever!\n\n6. The Family Man\n\nATHARV\n\nOn of the most recent shows, The Family Man is led by Manoj Bajpayee who is an intel officer working for NIA or the National Investigation Agency. It\u2019s Manoj\u2019s show out and out but the characters supporting the one-man army are carefully curated. Not only do they compliment him, they even help in boosting his role. One of the most loved characters that shine the brightest has to be his son Atharv. With limited screen time, this little one manages to lighten up the spy series. From blackmailing his father to fulfill his demands to being there for his elder sister, Atharv has won our hearts and how.\n\n7. This is Us\n\nBETH\n\nThe show that makes us laugh and cry in equal measures, This Is Us is basically all genres meshed into one. This show is a roller-coaster of emotions for most fans. The story is so beautiful that even the most cold-hearted people find themselves getting engrossed in it in no time. Now, if we had to pick one character out of the super amazing cast, it has to be Beth. While the main characters are already fan favourites, Beth is one character which somehow remains in the shadow of the lead yet plays an integral role. She has patiently been in the sidelines giving all the spotlight to the main cast. She is funny and practical and a rock for her husband Randall. After two seasons, she has finally got her own storyline and it\u2019s time we give her due credit for the same.\n\n8. The Grey\u2019s Anatomy\n\nCATHERINE FOX\n\nPeople have come and died, some have remained immortal in our memories, yet Grey\u2019s Anatomy is one show that has openly welcomed each and every character and the beauty of it is that each one of the characters have a kickass storyline. Some have a short span, others are regular, but one lady who stands out from the rest is the badass Catherine Avery aka Catherine Fox. Her character graph has seen it all. A new marriage, shedding her marital name which carried a mighty legacy and still managing to build a name for herself. Characters like her set an example for the people to look up to in the real world as well.\n\n9. Criminal Justice\n\nMUSTAFA\n\nhotstar\n\nYou can\u2019t call Jaggu dada a side character even when he is one for he owns the screen every time he performs. In this show as well, he is the kingpin of the prison. The leader who despite being in jail feels like a supremacy that no one can mess with. While Vikrant Massey\u2019s storyline kept us gripped throughout, it was Jackie's Mustafa who won hearts with his rawness.\n\n10. Killing Eve\n\nVILLANELLE\n\nThis is one show that has the undivided attention of fans and critics alike. Sweeping all the honorary nominations, Killing Eve has become a cult show in no time. It\u2019s your typical serial cat and mouse chase with the right amount of danger and intriguing twists. The best tadka, however, is the right amount of wit.The icing on top of it all is the fact that it\u2019s a female driven show. The too-smart-for-her-own-good Eve, played by Sandra, is a MI5 agent Eve while her arch nemesis Villanelle played by Jodie Comer is an international assassin. Their mutually obsessive relationship forms the plot for this show. While Sandra Oh is a phenomenal actor par excellence, the special mention belongs to Comer who stands her own ground opposite the former Grey\u2019s Anatomy actor. To shine in front of such an award-winning actor definitely deserves the most-loved title, don\u2019t you think?\n\n11. Sacred Games\n\nMAJID KHAN\n\nbollywood hungama\n\nWhile the first choice will always be Katekar, unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t make it to season 2. Like they say the show must go on, the second season did boast of some uber interesting characters which took the story to all new heights. The character that made us fall in love with him, this time around has to be Majid Khan. While he started off in the negative light, his transformation into Sartaj\u2019s helpful ally definitely made him a fan-favourite. You would be lying if you didn\u2019t feel when he got killed in the most unexpected manner.", "description": "With web-shows taking over our lives at an agile pace, it\u2019s becoming fairly difficult to sustain a lot of information.
