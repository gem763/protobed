(Evelyn Hockstein for The Washington Post)\n\nIn a secret chat last November, according to court filings, two associates of a violent white supremacist group discussed whether drug use was in line with their political beliefs.\n\n\u201cPsychedelic Nazis . . . There\u2019s nothing more Aryan than entheogenic drug use,\u201d Andrew Thomasberg, 21, texted a friend, according to prosecutors, referencing plants that have psychedelic effects. But, he added, \u201cDrug addiction is untermensch\u201d \u2014 a Nazi term for people considered subhuman.\n\nHis friend replied: \u201cThat\u2019s debatable. But I still have a bunch of shrooms anyway.\u201d\n\nThomasberg was arrested at his home in McLean on Thursday, according to court filings, accused of possessing guns as a drug user and illegally buying an AK-47 in 2017 for that friend, who is cooperating with authorities. In federal court in Alexandria on Friday, FBI Special Agent Shawn Matthews, who testified that his focus is domestic terrorism, said Thomasberg took part in the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017 with a neo-Nazi group called Vanguard America. After Charlottesville, Matthews said, Thomasberg gravitated to another neo-Nazi group called the Atomwaffen Division that is \u201cdistinct in that it advocates for violence or violent acts to start a racial war in the United States.\u201d\n\nProsecutors produced records of group chats in which Thomasberg said he was probably under investigation because he is \u201con record at shooting at people.\u201d Thomasberg said he had shouted the n-word at a group of African Americans at the mall, according to the chat logs, talked about a coming \u201cracial holy war\u201d and described racially motivated mass shooters as \u201csaints.\u201d\n\nMatthews said law enforcement found 20 guns in the home Thomasberg shared with his mother, stepfather and sister. Six were in Thomasberg\u2019s bedroom; most were loaded. There was also a pistol in his car.\n\nMarijuana was found in his home, although Thomasberg\u2019s family said it belonged to his stepfather.\n\nOne person close to Thomasberg told the FBI last year that he had three or four firearms and regularly carried a handgun. He bought two rifles, a pistol and a handgun in the past four years, according to court records.\n\nThe case is one of several brought recently in federal court charging people linked to far-right groups with gun or drug crimes. A D.C. man who glorified violence against minorities on social media was sentenced last week to 10 months\u2019 time served on a gun charge.\n\nJudge Theresa Buchanan declined to grant bail for Thomasberg, calling the evidence \u201cextremely concerning.\u201d\n\nThomasberg\u2019s mother, who declined to give her name, said there were \u201ca lot of discrepancies\u201d and \u201clies\u201d in the case against her son. She said he is active in the Greek Orthodox Church.\n\n\u201cThe United States seeking out a rich, white kid \u2014 not cool,\u201d she said.\n\nAn attorney for Thomasberg, Elita Amato, declined to comment. In court, she emphasized that there was no evidence that Thomasberg was using drugs while buying guns.\n\nA 2013 conviction was referenced in court by the judge; Thomasberg would have been a juvenile at the time, and those records are not accessible.\n\nIn June, he texted the friend who is now cooperating, known in court papers as B.B., that he was \u201ccarrying enough gear and supplies to set the new high score and wouldn\u2019t want to have to explain that to a cop.\u201d\n\nAccording to Matthews in his affidavit, \u201chigh score\u201d is a reference to mass shootings.\n\nThomasberg bought the AK-47 for B.B. in October 2017 at the Sterling, Va., gun store where he worked, in violation of store policy, according to Matthews. The gun was found when police searched B.B.\u2019s home this year as part of a separate investigation. Matthews said Thomasberg described the gun in an interview Thursday as a \u201cstraw purchase.\u201d B.B. said the pair made up a bill of sale for the gun as a \u201cjoke\u201d with the price $14.14; the number 14 is a reference to a white-supremacist slogan.\n\nAlong with LSD and mushrooms, according to prosecutors, Thomasberg and B.B. discussed using marijuana, opium and the prescription stimulant Modafinil.\n\nIn July, Thomasberg applied for a concealed-carry permit in Fairfax and was denied.\n\nEric Clingan, a defense attorney, said he considered calling Thomasberg as a witness during the murder trial of a man who was eventually convicted of shooting and killing another man at a Fairfax County shopping center last year. Clingan said his client, Manvinder Aulakh, was friends with Thomasberg and had learned self-defense techniques from him.\n\nBut Clingan said he dropped those plans after a background check revealed that Thomasberg had talked about marching in Charlottesville with white-supremacist groups.\n\n\u201cMy client and I determined that we didn\u2019t want Mr. Thomasberg to testify in any manner,\u201d Clingan said.\n\nJustin Jouvenal contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Andrew Thomasberg, 21, is accused of illegally acquiring firearms as a drug user.", "authors": ["Rachel Weiner", "Local Reporter Covering Federal Court In Alexandria", "Va.", "Local Court In Arlington", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_Pj0DHCSreZw58ZFL2S8B-qBwuo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V4QZFMFZGUI6PPUU7K5Q6HU77M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
