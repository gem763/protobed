The Houthis, for their part, said they would cease all drone and missile strikes in the kingdom.\n\nThe Houthis have also released hundreds of prisoners including three Saudis as part of the UN-supervised Stockholm Agreement. On the other hand, the movement has also carried out cross-border raids some of which have resulted in capturing Saudi forces and munitions \u2013 although the extent to which has been disputed.\n\nREAD: Yemeni government denies prisoner swap proposal by Houthis\n\nAlthough the Saudis agreed to a halt in air raids over four Houthi-held cities including the capital Sanaa, they have continued with further air strikes, carrying out over 250 since the initiative was offered, according to Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree.\n\nDespite this, it has been reported that the scale of the bombardments has since been significantly reduced. Sources affiliated with the Houthis however, have claimed that the Saudis have repeatedly breached the conditions of the Swedish backed agreement.\n\nLast month it was also reported that the US government had started direct communication with the Houthis, the last known contact was under the Obama administration which led to failed peace talks in Geneva.\n\nREAD: Tehran confirms reception of a Saudi message requesting dialogue with Iran\n\nThe five-year conflict escalated with the coalition intervening after the Houthis gained control of the capital and ousting the Saudi-backed Yemeni government. The war has brought about what the UN describes as \u201cthe world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis\u201d leaving ten million people on the brink of famine, with the war-torn country on track to become the poorest country in the world should the war continue.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018_5-31-Abdrabbuh-Mansur-Hadi-Mohammed-bin-Salman-Al-Saud-in-Saudi-Arabia20180531_2_30648497_34215273.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&quality=75&strip=all&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
