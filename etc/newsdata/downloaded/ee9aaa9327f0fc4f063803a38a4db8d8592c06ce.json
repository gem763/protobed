Source: Blockchain\n\nThis is the largest reading ever and echoed by others such as BitInfoCharts, which recorded an all-time high of just over 110 quintillion at the same time. Coin Dance numbers put the all-time high of 134 quintillion occurring on Oct. 10.\n\nDue to it being impossible to measure hash rate exactly, all charts are estimates that rely on the previous period\u2019s block times.\n\nHash rate refers to the overall computing power involved in validating transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. More power suggests greater network security, as well as interest in the profitability potential of Bitcoin mining.\n\nIn other words, miners are anticipating higher Bitcoin prices in the future.\n\nMiner profitability being tested with the latest price drop\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the network hash rate appeared to experience volatility last month, with Blockchain\u2019s reading falling 40% in one day before analysts explained the statistics did not imply miners were deserting Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, the mounting hash rate in the face of a falling Bitcoin price underscores their dedication to investing in the industry \u2014 and its future profitability. Mining giant Bitmain, for example, this week launched what it calls the \u201cworld\u2019s largest\u201d mining farm in Rockdale, Texas.\n\nOn the other hand, the profitability metric is, in fact, approaching its lowest in 12 months, with one miner telling Cointelegraph that $6,500 is a floor price to maintain profitability for participants. Pass it, and Bitcoin then could see a reduction in hashing power, as miners may choose to turn off their rigs until difficulty adjusts and/or prices recover.\n\nAccording to investor Dovey Wan, Bitmain\u2019s Antminer S9 mining rig model \u2014 one of the most popular miners int he world \u2014 is already in the red at current prices, even before miscellaneous costs such as electricity are taken into account.\n\nTherefore, it remains to be seen if the latest drop in Bitcoin price will have a negative impact on the hash rate.\n\nAll eyes on block reward halving\n\nFrom May 2020, miners will compete for half as many new Bitcoins per new block as now \u2014 6.25 BTC instead of 12.5 BTC.\n\nWith the equivalent of up to $63 million unavailable each week, commentators widely expect the block halving event to dramatically boost the Bitcoin price.", "description": "Computing resources dedicated to Bitcoin transaction validation is bigger than ever, underscoring miners\u2019 overall bullish sentiment despite the price falling", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMGVhNjY4NmEwMWFlNTA1MjNmMjZhYjRmNjQ1N2VkNjAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
