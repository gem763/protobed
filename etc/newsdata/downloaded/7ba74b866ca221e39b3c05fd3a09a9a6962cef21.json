Davis, the former light heavyweight champion, lost his title to Ryan Bader and would like nothing more than to get it back, but he will do it his way.\n\nHe just wants to keep winning until you can\u2019t deny him.\n\n\u201cI try to lead my life in a way where I am accountable for my own actions,\u201d Davis said Friday during the post-fight news conference. \u201cAnd ultimately it makes me happier because I\u2019m in the driver\u2019s seat, and I\u2019m the one making all the decisions. And so when I lose the title to Ryan Bader, I don\u2019t feel like I want to say give me a title shot, title shot, you need to be fighting people in this division. I want to win fights and make the fans say what the heck is this, he keeps winning, what\u2019s going on with this title?\u201d\n\nSince edging Davis in 2017, Bader has defended his 205-pound title only once and gone on to win the heavyweight title, holding two belts simultaneously. It\u2019s been almost two years exactly since Bader last competed at light heavyweight, and Davis thinks the division has got to get moving.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to defend that title, and I think it\u2019s gotten to that point, and I think hopefully he\u2019s going to fight against (Vadim) Nemkov, and we\u2019ll get some fresh blood in there and see where we\u2019re at,\u201d Davis said. \u201cBut my job is simple: Go in the cage, fight, win, and just wash, rinse, repeat.\u201d\n\nAnd that is why Davis has suggested a light heavyweight grand prix, hoping to face the likes of Nemkov, another narrow loss on his resume that he\u2019d like to avenge.\n\n\u201cI want all of them. I want everybody,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThere\u2019s room for plenty in the grand prix. I definitely got to get a win back over Mr. Nemkov. Great fight, he\u2019s a great competitor, he just had a big win, but most likely he\u2019s waiting to fight for the title. I would love to fight him. Great fight, close fight, and he got the win, so I got to get that back. And whenever there\u2019s an opportunity, I would love to fight for the title again.\u201d", "description": "Former Bellator champion Phil Davis wants to do things his way when it comes to earning a shot at Ryan Bader.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/phil-davis-bellator-231-post-copy.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
