And Sunday's goalfest came against the meanest defense, with Udinese having only conceded six goals in its previous eight matches.\n\nLuis Muriel grabbed a hat trick against his former club. Josip Ilicic scored two and was only denied a hat trick of his own by the crossbar.\n\n\"Our strength up front allows us to deal with some mistakes at the back, but if we also had the best defense we would be at the top of the table,\" Gasperini said.\n\nIMPRESSIVE TEENAGERS\n\nAtalanta has long been known for producing great players, having helped to launch the careers of the likes of Roberto Donadoni, Christian Vieri, and Filippo Inzaghi.\n\nAnd another potential star has emerged from its youth ranks as 17-year-old substitute Amad Traor\u00e9 scored six minutes into his debut.\n\nHe became the first player born in the year 2002 to score a Serie A goal.\n\n\"Scoring on his debut is a great sign. He has talent but I don't think youngsters like him are already ready for the Champions League,\" Gasperini said. \"There's still a gap between the youth league and Serie A. They need to take it step by step.\"\n\nTraor\u00e9 would have been the first player born in 2002 to play in Italy's top flight had Inter forward Sebastiano Esposito not made his Serie A debut the previous day, in the Nerazzurri's 2-2 draw against Parma.\n\nEsposito almost scored a stoppage-time winner but volleyed narrowly wide of the right post.\n\nIt was another impressive performance from the 17-year-old, who also shined midweek in the 2-0 Champions League victory over Borussia Dortmund.\n\nEsposito won a penalty and consistently troubled the Dortmund defense. He appeared unfazed at making his Champions League debut despite having only previously played 17 minutes for Inter's first team.\n\nWhile Traor\u00e9 and Esposito were unknowns, there has long been hype around another teenager: Brescia midfielder Sandro Tonali.\n\nThe 19-year-old has even been compared to Andrea Pirlo.\n\nTonali scored his first Serie A goal on Saturday and it was worth the wait. He curled a free kick into the top far corner from near the left touchline. He did later confess he had intended it as a cross.\n\nUnfortunately it counted for little as Brescia lost 3-1 at Genoa.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
