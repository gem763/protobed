Experts say they were kept prisoner for six months, fed and then used in sacrificial enactment scenes from mythology.\n\nThey were members of a Spanish convoy from Cuba who reached Aztec territory in 1520, laden with supplies for Conquistador Hernan Cortes.\n\nBut they met a grisly end at the hands of their Aztec captors, who held them prisoner in doorless cells where they were 'fattened up' for sacrifice.\n\nThe Aztec inhabitants of Zultepec captured a convoy of about 15 male Spaniards, 50 women, 10 children and 45 foot soldiers in 1520. Over the next six months the town ate the prisoners - including toddlers and pregnant female 'warriors' whose heads were strung up on skull racks alongside their men.\n\nAdorning the 27.5-foot long wall are 11 carved images, as well as what was once a wooden gate.
