You have your strategy in place. But, you also like to look ahead, to the production the players you draft might provide you, say, in the first couple of weeks of the season.\n\nOr maybe you\u2019ve already wrapped up your draft, and you\u2019re looking to see which of your players will give you the most bang for your buck the first couple of weeks.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBrad Evans and Andy Behrens have you covered with four players who are set to start the fantasy season off strong.\n\nCurtis Samuel will deliver on the hype\n\nAndy has made huge investments in Samuel this year, and he admits that the entire Carolina offense could get off to a fast start, too. An extremely talented player, Samuel gets to face off against the Rams, Bucs, and Cardinals the first three weeks of the season. The Rams and Bucs had bottom-5 pass defenses in 2018, while \u2018Zona is gonna be without their top two corners to start the year. Samuel could get off to a raucous start.\n\nLamar Jackson ready to be dual-threat?\n\nWe\u2019ve talked Jackson up a lot this August, and Brad thinks the second-year QB will be flying out of the gates, hopefully through the air as well as his legs. Jackson opens at Miami before Arizona and Kansas City, and Brad thinks he\u2019ll be a top-five QB by the time Week 4 rolls around.\n\nDak Prescott often gets overlooked\n\nAndy follows up with another passer in Prescott, who has never finished out of the top-12 fantasy quarterbacks since he\u2019s been in the league. He opens against the Giants before facing Washington and Miami \u2014 all great matchups for Prescott.\n\nTevin Coleman set to run wild\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Brad shares how Coleman \u2014 who starts the season off against Tampa, Cincy, and Pittsburgh \u2014 could expose those three questionable rush defenses while seeing more than 50 percent of the backfield share in San Francisco.\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "Andy Behrens and Brad Evans give their picks for four players who could get off to fast starts this fantasy season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8XHYeEKGdw6h4AZaD3KW2Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Yd46bXscQNvJ4O0rbdJC4g--~B/aD0yNTk5O3c9Mzg5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/fe2e4850-c930-11e9-a79f-45be178724a5"}
