Some may return to the United States, officials said.\n\nWhat routes will the troops use in exiting Syria?\n\nThe western and eastern headquarters are likely to withdraw independently of each other. In the west, American forces will, according to American military officials, probably leave through the Kobani airfield, known as the Kobani Landing Zone. That base, with its long dirt runaway, can support C-17 transport aircraft and has a large Air Force contingent of maintenance staff. In the east, those forces will most likely exit overland and into Iraq in convoys, with some traveling via helicopter airlift.\n\nAre there risks in the withdrawal?\n\nThe risk of confrontation with the medley of different ground forces \u2014 both state-led and proxy \u2014 is undoubtedly higher than it was several weeks ago.\n\nConvoys moving through contested territory and aircraft making repeated landings all might contribute to an accidental confrontation or a staged attack, especially from any Islamic State leftovers that might want to take advantage of the sudden withdrawal.\n\nOne of the biggest risks to the remaining American troops as they pull back will most likely be attacks from a Turkish-backed Syrian militia called the Free Syrian Army, which has spearheaded the Turkish offensive in many places along the border. Those troops are supported by Turkish Army artillery and mortar fire, and Turkish Air Force strikes.\n\nAmerican officials say these Turkish-backed militia are less disciplined than regular Turkish soldiers, and deliberately or inadvertently have fired on retreating American troops. Another emerging threat comes from Islamic State fighters, who had gone underground after the defeat of the final shards of the terror group\u2019s caliphate, or religious state, in northern Syria this year.\n\nThe hasty, risky nature of the withdrawal might actually require that the number of American troops in Syria be increased, at least temporarily. The military\u2019s Central Command is preparing to send hundreds of additional American forces to help secure bases where American Special Forces have been operating with their Syrian Kurdish partners \u2014 many of whom have now left to fight the Turks \u2014 and safely evacuate those Americans in the coming weeks.", "description": "The Pentagon will have to disassemble combat bases that were built to stay for a mission that was supposed to last, and protect the troops as they withdraw amid a chaotic battlefield.", "authors": ["Thomas Gibbons-Neff", "Eric Schmitt"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/us/politics/15dc-troops/15dc-troops-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
