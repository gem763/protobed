Josh Harder, a California Democrat, brought a dead nutria \u2014 commonly referred to as a \u201cswamp rat\u201d \u2014 to a congressional hearing this week as he sought support for a bill that would direct $7 million to help eradicate the invasive rodent species from his state.\n\nThat money would be on top of $8.5 million state wildlife officials said they were granted in May for three years of combating swamp rats. But it\u2019ll be cheaper to deal with them sooner rather than later, according to Harder.\n\nRepresentative Josh Harder (CA-10) today brought a taxidermy nutria to a hearing to illustrate the scale of the threat posed by the invasive species and the importance of his legislation to eradicate it.

They destroy almond trees as well as irrigation canals,\u201d he testified during a congressional hearing this week. \u201cThey can even cause flooding because they burrow into our water control systems.\u201d\n\nNutria are about five times the size of muskrats, but smaller than beavers, which are both native to California.

Officials estimate they damaged more than 100,000 coastal acres in Louisiana, and eradicating them has cost $24 million since 2002.
