There will be manufacturing and services surveys for the United States, which will also release data on its trade balance and non-farm payrolls.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said the sides would still meet for talks later this month, but hopes for a resolution to the trade war have diminished.\n\nForeign-exchange trading could be subdued on Monday as U.S. financial markets are closed for the Labor Day holiday.\n\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed on Monday at 98.821.\n\nRisk sentiment could also take a hit due to ongoing protests in Hong Kong over China's rule of the city.\n\nThousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday in a bid to draw attention to their fight for democracy.\n\nThe euro stood at $1.0991, unchanged in Asia, but sentiment for the common currency was weak after it tumbled on Friday to the lowest in more than two years.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and her coalition partners held off a surge in far right support in two state elections in eastern Germany on Sunday.\n\nThe result averted an immediate political crisis in Europe's largest economy, but expectations are high that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates at its next monetary policy meeting on Sept. 12, which could weigh on the euro.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2158, down 0.07% so far on the day.", "description": "The yen strengthened on Monday, thanks to bigger appetites for safe-haven assets as Washington and Beijing put additional tariffs on each other's exports, adding to the gloom hanging over the global economic outlook.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102382572-1717131.jpg?v=1529467662"}
