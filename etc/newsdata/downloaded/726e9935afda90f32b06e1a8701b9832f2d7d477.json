And remember, very, very recently \u2013 barely seven weeks ago \u2013 the formal policy of the cabinet was to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\u201d\n\nQ&A Who were the rebel Tories? Show Hide Here is the list of the 21 Conservative MPs who voted with the opposition and against the government on Tuesday night\u2019s motion to seize control of the parliamentary timetable in order to pave the way for a bill to block a no-deal Brexit. Guto Bebb, Aberconwy Richard Benyon, Newbury Steve Brine, Winchester Alistair Burt, North East Bedfordshire Greg Clark, Tunbridge Wells Kenneth Clarke, Rushcliffe David Gauke, South West Hertfordshire Justine Greening, Putney Dominic Grieve, Beaconsfield Sam Gyimah, East Surrey Philip Hammond, Runnymede and Weybridge Stephen Hammond, Wimbledon Richard Harrington, Watford Margot James, Stourbridge Sir Oliver Letwin, West Dorset Anne Milton, Guildford Caroline Nokes, Romsey and Southampton North Antoinette Sandbach, Eddisbury Sir Nicholas Soames, Mid Sussex Rory Stewart, Penrith and The Border Edward Vaizey, Wantage\n\n\n\nLater on Monday, the rebel bill that led to Stewart and others losing the Tory whip is expected to receive royal assent. It will mandate Johnson to seek a Brexit delay till 31 January if, by the middle of next month, he has not passed a departure deal or got MPs\u2019 consent for no deal.\n\nStewart dismissed reported ideas that Johnson \u2013 who has pledged to never seek a delay \u2013 could seek to get round the law, for example by adding a second letter to the mandated approach to the EU over an extension spelling out that he does not actually want this.\n\n\u201cI remain very, very confident we can stop no deal. Because in the end parliament is sovereign, and we are making a positive case for a moderate, pragmatic solution to the problem,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Gauke, the former justice secretary and another key rebel, said a separate letter would be pointless given the EU would know it was not the will of parliament. \u201cThe European Union are perfectly capable of following our news stories,\u201d he told BBC1\u2019s Breakfast programme.\n\nOf a parallel letter, Gauke said: \u201cIt carries no weight. Statute will say that the position is that the prime minister is writing to the European Union seeking an extension. Now, of course, the European Union can refuse that extension. I personally think that they wouldn\u2019t want to be blamed for a no-deal Brexit and they will agree to an extension.\u201d\n\nWhile saying he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that Johnson would ultimately comply with the new law, he condemned anonymous briefings that No 10 could decide to simply ignore it, calling this \u201cdamaging to our reputation\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking on Monday, the former supreme court justice Lord Sumption said it would not be legal for Johnson to apply for a Brexit extension while simultaneously trying to get the EU to reject it.\n\n\u201cNo, of course it wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he told Today. \u201cThe bill, or act as it\u2019s about to become, says that he\u2019s got to apply for an extension. Not only has he got to send the letter, he\u2019s got to apply for an extension. To send the letter and then try to neutralise it seems to me, plainly, a breach of the act. What you\u2019ve got to realise is the courts are not very fond of loopholes.\u201d\n\nWhen he returns from Dublin later on Monday, Johnson is expected to make a second attempt to trigger a general election on 15 October by asking MPs to support a motion tabled under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.\n\nBut he is almost certain to be rebuffed for a second time, after opposition leaders agreed on Friday to reject a snap poll until a no-deal Brexit has been definitively avoided.\n\nSpeaking before the Dublin trip the Irish finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, told Today he remained unclear about much-touted UK government plans for alternative arrangements to replace the backstop, the guarantee against a hard Irish border, which Johnson has vowed to scrap.\n\n\u201cWhat I would say to those who are putting those ideas forward is we are yet to see examples of how they would work not only on our island but anywhere else in the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo be in a situation where we would have one part of our island inside the single market and the other outside the single market is a very, very testing challenge for alternative arrangements.\u201d", "description": "Rory Stewart says more cabinet ministers could follow Amber Rudd in resigning", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0979ae0e5c48965b3c271711e980ab5a771b349/0_174_5016_3009/master/5016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e8d29679b860376e955f5413c57ca1db", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
