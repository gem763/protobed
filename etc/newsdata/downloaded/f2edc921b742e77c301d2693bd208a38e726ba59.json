Yet just last year every Democratic frontrunner voted in favor of FOSTA-SESTA, legislation that is supposed to inhibit sex trafficking online but in reality strips sex workers of resources to book and screen clients, thereby creating a more dangerous work environment under the guise of protecting those same workers. So, this begs the question: How serious are these candidates, really?\n\nThough it hardly qualifies as \u201cin favor,\u201d Elizabeth Warren threw her hat in with the progressives in recent comments made to the Washington Post. \u201cI\u2019m open to decriminalization. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy but they are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse and hardship,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we don\u2019t undermine legal protections for the most vulnerable, including the millions of individuals who are victims of human trafficking each year.\u201d\n\nSex worker activist Ginger Banks finds statements like these encouraging: \u201cWith bodily autonomy currently at the forefront of many social movements, it was only a matter of time before sex work decriminalization became accepted as well. I\u2019m glad to see Democratic candidates realizing that \u2018my body, my choice\u2019 extends to a person\u2019s choice to do sex work.\u201d\n\nOn the heels of Warren\u2019s statement, Bernie Sanders\u2019 camp raced to issue a similar comment, saying that \u201cdecriminalization is certainly something that should be considered.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris has made similar remarks of late about decriminalizing sex work but in the context of the Nordic model, which targets customers instead of escorts but still criminalizes the purchase of sex\u2014just not those selling it.\n\nBut those pro-decriminalization comments seem far-fetched given Harris\u2019 background as an attorney general prosecuting those involved with sex work and Warren\u2019s joint effort with Florida Senator Marco Rubio in 2017 to introduce legislation that would enable banks to discriminate against sex worker, known as the \u201cEnd Banking for Human Traffickers Act.\u201d (Despite bipartisan support Warren and Rubio\u2019s initiative was never voted on by the Senate, but the same bill has been reintroduced this year as H.R.295 - End Banking for Human Traffickers Act of 2019 and just passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee in March.)\n\nEmma Evans, a sex worker, tweeted the following sentiment\u2014which was shared by other members of the adult industry: \u201cI don\u2019t hate Elizabeth Warren. I like her the best of all the candidates. I know many of you like her too. But, I need you to press her on sex worker issues for me, because she supports some shit with Rubio that foreshadows us losing the ability to bank. Which is deadly.\u201d\n\n\u201c I see why some people like Warren but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll focus much on decriminalizing sex work if she\u2019s elected, she\u2019ll most likely forget about that promise. \u201d\n\nActions taken against sex workers continue to outweigh the goodwill implied by the politicians\u2019 statements, and until lawmakers can understand the material difference between what is consensual sex work and what is coerced sex trafficking, any offer to decriminalize sex work feels empty. Despite this, many in the adult industry remain hopeful that it\u2019s nonetheless a step in the right direction\u2014and some are even rooting for Warren thanks to a statement she made hinting that she may in fact see the difference between sex work and sex trafficking.\n\n\u201cWhat I hope we\u2019re trying to look for is not the question about sex\u2014sex is good\u2014but the question of exploitation, and how fine the line that runs between those who have been taken advantage of, who are being trafficked, who are being abused, and those who are not,\u201d Warren said.\n\nMulti-award-winning actor James Bartholet is more skeptical of Warren\u2019s newly acquired stance\u2014and hopes this isn\u2019t going to bring further complications to the adult industry: \u201cIf Elizabeth Warren and all the rest will push for the rights of sex workers, I applaud them for doing that. But will it really happen? The other danger will be putting us all in the conservative crosshairs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Carmen Valentina, the reigning 2019 HotMovies MVP (Most Valuable Pornstar), doesn\u2019t have much faith in the empty promises of politicians. \u201cI\u2019m an independent and I don\u2019t like voting blindly by party. I like politicians who are willing to meet in the middle, not ones on the far end of their party; we can accomplish more by give and take,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c I see why some people like Warren but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll focus much on decriminalizing sex work if she\u2019s elected, she\u2019ll most likely forget about that promise,\u201d Valentina continued. \u201cMost politicians don\u2019t care for sex workers and if they say they do they eventually forget about us because sex work is still a taboo that\u2019s looked down upon, no matter how far we think we have come.\u201d", "description": "The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate recently said she\u2019s open to decriminalizing sex work, but given her history some in the adult industry aren\u2019t buying it.", "authors": ["Aurora Snow"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1565735834/190809-Snow-Elizabeth-Warren-tease_cinlg2", "published_at": "2019-08-14"}
