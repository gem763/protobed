Farmer Telling Pollies Exactly How The Drought Is Hurting Kids", "language": "en", "text": "Farmers in drought-stricken Australia worry over the days, weeks, and months ahead, asking when rain will return to replenish the nation\u2019s agricultural regions. But the younger generation has a somewhat different concern: whether farming will be viable in the future at all.\n\nThat was the concern raised by grazier Kate McBride on Q&A last night, who cut through political debate on the panel show to urge clear-headed support for young Australians doing it tough in regional areas \u2013 and the 21-year-old\u2019s strong showing framed the issue as an existential threat.\n\nAfter John Southon, principal of Trundle Central School, asked the panel why Australia offers so little support to young people when droughts roll around, Water Resources Minister David Littleproud asserted \u201cThere is a future in agriculture.\n\n\u201cThe story of agriculture is just add rain. We can\u2019t beat ourselves up. We have been through this before. We\u2019ll be through it again.\u201d\n\nDiscussion fell to Shadow Agriculture Minister Joel Fitzgibbon, who criticised Littleproud and his Coalition counterparts for their handling of drought relief payments. Through the noise came McBride, who expressed her fears that her community\u2019s way of life is no longer possible.\n\n\u201cThe question was what\u2019s the future for the kids and that\u2019s my question as well,\u201d McBride said.\n\nAs a young farmer, I\u2019m 21 years old, where is my future in all this? I spoke to people this week saying there were people in their communities taking kids out of boarding school because they can\u2019t afford it anymore. That\u2019s destroying their future. But they get dragged back to a property where they can\u2019t see a future themselves. What are we doing for these kids? They\u2019re not going to be allowed in the cities. They come home and there\u2019s nothing for them there. I don\u2019t understand. For kids, what are we doing and how are we helping these kids?\n\nThe community of Trundle in western NSW are disillusioned about the speed and targeting of aid.
