This was the third time he has started alongside Messi and Suarez but the first that they have really gelled as a trio.\n\nThere was good news too for Barcelona in defence, where Samuel Umtiti came through 90 minutes in what was his first appearance of the season. Umtiti, who has been out with a foot injury, replaced the banned Gerard Pique.\n\nThe only blot on the afternoon was an injury to Sergi Roberto, who hurt his left knee and was replaced at half-time.\n\nThe visting fans chanted in support of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned last week for their failed independence bid in 2017.\n\nSuarez tried his luck from the halfway line early on before Griezmann\u2019s finish clipped the inside of the post and found the net after 13 minutes.\n\nMessi should have made it two before half-time but was denied one-on-one by goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic. He then he played Suarez through but the Uruguayan\u2019s goal was ruled for offside.\n\nBarca did make it two just before the hour as Frenkie de Jong\u2019s incisive ball was collected by Suarez. As he lost control, Griezmann took over, flicking left to Messi, who made no mistake.\n\nThe third involved all three again. Griezmann\u2019s superb reverse pass set Messi clear and while he could have had his second, he generously slipped the ball left for Suarez who found the back of an open goal.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 Barcelona\u2019s \u2018MSG\u2019 is finally up and running as Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Antoine Griezmann all scored in a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/492e79_lionel-messi-scored-his-goal-season-in-barcelona-win-eibar-on-saturday-messi-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
