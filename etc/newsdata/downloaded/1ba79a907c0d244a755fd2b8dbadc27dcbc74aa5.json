But he wasn\u2019t interested in that particular road back.\n\n\u201cYou never want to see yourself losing, but I thought if I can\u2019t do it here \u2026\u201d Powell said. \u201cMy management is amazing, and they were basically like, \u2018We could get you an easier fight.\u2019 The UFC liked me \u2013 get a couple of easy wins outside the UFC, and they\u2019d probably bring me back. But it didn\u2019t excite me.\n\n\u201cI could easily get easy fights, but I wanted this opportunity and I got it and I got to showcase my skills and got the finish.\u201d\n\nThe submission finish by Powell will certainly be a memorable one. Referee Kevin MacDonald stepped in at the end of Round 2 to break up the choke, a few seconds after Surin gave a thumbs up that he was OK.\n\nBut when MacDonald broke it off at the end of the round and Powell stood up to go to his corner, Surin attempted to take MacDonald down. With it clear that Surin had gone out from the choke at some point long enough to think MacDonald was his opponent, MacDonald stopped the fight to give Powell the technical submission win.\n\n\u201cSecond round, I literally watched somebody finish the fight like that in PFL,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I really want to hit this,\u2019 and I just told him that I\u2019ve never done that even in jiu-jitsu class, like sniping that down, hitting that rear-naked style guillotine. I think that\u2019s what it was. But it felt super deep, so I kept squeezing, trying to put my lats into it.\n\n\u201cThen I was like, \u2018Oh God damn it, the round ended,\u2019 and then he was wrestling the ref. I was like, \u2018Oh wait, I did it \u2013 he is out.\u2019 So that was kinda crazy.\u201d", "description": "Devin Powell admits prior to the fight, he envisioned himself retiring if he had lost at Bellator 232.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/devin-powell-bellator-232-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
