There\u2019s nothing wrong with preferring a neat pour of whiskey to a daiquiri, but judging a drink by its colour, glassware, or imagined gender is deeply weird, particularly when fruit is delicious, and coupes are classy.\n\nBesides, pink\u2014the colour most commonly associated with girly-ness\u2014happens to be the colour of most Campari-based beverages, which are bitter, a flavour that is usually not considered feminine, which is odd, when you consider how often that word is used to describe outspoken women.\n\nAnyway. My point is that you cannot know what a beverage will taste like until you taste it, and that even easy-drinking fruity drinks\u2014nay, especially easy-drinking fruity drinks\u2014can pack a punch just as potent as any stiff whiskey beverage. Such is the case with this extremely pretty cacha\u00e7a and pineapple drink.\n\nCacha\u00e7a, pineapple, and Campari may not seem like a natural trio, but the funky sugar cane spirit benefits from sweet pineapple and bitter Campari in ways I didn\u2019t see coming. It\u2019s a gentle rollercoaster of complementary and contrasting flavours, and it will mess you right up. (It\u2019s also surprisingly morning-appropriate, which is something else I didn\u2019t see coming.) To make this pretty pink pineapple number, you will need:\n\n2 ounces cacha\u00e7a\n\n1 ounce pineapple juice\n\n3/4 ounces Campari\n\nPour everything into a shaker filled with ice and shake hard until the shaker becomes too comfortable to hold. Strain into a classy coupe. Enjoy.", "description": "People who shun fruity drinks or drinks that come in coupe glasses on \u201cprinciple\u201d are most likely very boring people.
