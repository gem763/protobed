"language": "en", "text": "The prime minister insists the UK will still leave the EU this month (Picture: Reuters/PA)\n\nYesterday was supposed to be the day when we came closer to a Brexit resolution, but with the MPs voting for a delay, what happens next?\n\nWhat happened in Parliament?\n\n\u2018Super Saturday\u2019, where MPs sat in the Commons for the first time in 37 years, was meant to be a day of immense significance for the country\u2019s future, where the government finally tried to conclude a Brexit deal.\n\nHowever, matters did not go the way Boris Johnson planned, after MPs voted by a majority of 16 to back an amendment put forward by former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin to \u2018withhold approval of the deal agreed between Mr Johnson and Brussels unless and until implementing legislation is passed\u2019.\n\nThat means that with Mr Johnson failing to get a \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 vote on his Brexit deal, he has had to send a letter to the EU asking for an extension.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSir Oliver, who lost the Tory whip for voting against the Government on Brexit previously, said the amendment was designed to act as \u2018insurance\u2019 against the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal by mistake on the scheduled deadline of October 31.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to

amendment.\n\nHowever, Mr Johnson insisted that the government would still push ahead and bring the Withdrawal Agreement Bill \u2013 the legislation needed for Brexit \u2013 to the Commons next week.\n\nCould Mr Johnson still get his deal through Parliament?\n\nThere is still the possibility that Mr Johnson could get his deal through Parliament before the October 31 deadline, but time is running out and the European Parliament would also need to ratify it.\n\nMPs voted by a majority of 16 to back an amendment put forward by former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin to \u2018withhold

yet been tested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe prime minister still has to overcome strong opposition from the, DUP which has said it will not back the deal.\n\nIf there is to be another vote, when will it happen?\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, said the government wants to hold another meaningful vote on Mr Johnson\u2019s deal on Monday.\n\nLeader of the House

the government\u2019s plans.\n\nWelsh Labour MP Chris Bryant said, in a point of order, that it is not good practice for a Government to keep holding debates on the exact same subject.\n\nWhat about the letters sent last night?\n\nUnder the terms of the so-called Benn Act, which MP\u2019s passed in a bid to block a no-deal Brexit, Mr Johnson was compelled to write to the EU asking for a three-month Brexit extension after the failure to secure a deal by 11pm yesterday.\n\nThe prime minister told the Commons: \u2018I will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so.\u2019\n\nBut the Prime Minister did send two letters to European Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nBoris Johnson was forced to write a letter to the EU yesterday to ask for a request (Picture: Reuters)\n\nFirst, there was an unsigned photocopy of the request he was obliged to send under the Benn Act, followed by a letter explaining why the Government did not actually want an extension.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was also an explanatory letter from Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU, which was sent to Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen, the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union.\n\nWill the EU agree to an extension?\n\nDespite European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker raising doubts over another Brexit delay, the decision needs to be taken by all 27 remaining EU states, not him.\n\nHowever, the EU could set a different length to an extension, either shorter or longer than the three-month one cited in the Benn Act.\n\nCommons Speaker, John Bercow, said he would consider whether to allow the government\u2019s plans (Picture: Reuters)\n\nThe EU could decide not to formally respond to such a letter from the PM, until it sees if Mr Johnson can get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through Parliament next week.\n\nWill there be an emergency EU summit?\n\nIf the PM gets the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through, there could be a special gathering of leaders on October 28.\n\nIf the deal needs more time at that stage to get through Parliament, leaders could agree to a short extension.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
