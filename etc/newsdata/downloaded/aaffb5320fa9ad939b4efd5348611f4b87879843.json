Here are two provocative assertions often made about buybacks: 1) Stock buybacks are driving all of the stock market returns and 2) Companies should use cash by investing in their own businesses \u2014 and the economy \u2014 instead of enriching shareholders by buying back stock.\n\nThere isn\u2019t enough space here to fully address these statements. But there is enough space to hit some facts.\n\nFor starters, we can all agree that earnings and the prospect for earnings growth are the key drivers of stock prices in the long run. According to what Warren Buffett calls the \u201cultimate formula,\u201d the value of a stock is equal to the present value of all the money a company will earn.\n\nAnd by extension, the price of a single share is driven by earnings per share (EPS). So, it\u2019s easy to jump to the conclusion that a stock buyback will boost a share\u2019s price because that company\u2019s earnings is now being allocated to fewer shares.\n\nBut there are bigger things driving EPS. Consider revenue and profit margins.\n\nBelow is a chart from JPMorgan Asset Management breaking down historical S&P 500 (^GSPC) EPS growth by revenue growth, profit margin expansion, and share count change. Sure, there are years when changes in share count account for a big part of one year\u2019s change in EPS. But over time, EPS is overwhelmingly about revenue growth and the ability to amplify earnings with an expanding profit margin.\n\nThe first thing to know about buybacks: they're not the biggest driver of EPS growth. (JPMorgan Asset Management) More\n\nAnd you can\u2019t can\u2019t grow revenue and boost profit margins by buying back stock. You do it by increasing demand, expanding capacity and replacing inefficient equipment among other things. And you accomplish this with capital expenditures, research and development, and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nSo then, why are companies supposedly spending all their money on buybacks? Well, it\u2019s because they\u2019re not.\n\nBelieve it or not, companies have historically spent most of their cash on these shareholder enriching growth initiatives. According to Goldman Sachs, S&P 500 constituents have consistently allocated more than half of their cash usage for investing in growth. The biggest single category for cash use: capital expenditures.\n\nThe second thing to know about buybacks: companies spend more cash on capex. (Goldman Sachs) More\n\nIf the priority is to get that stock price up, then the move is to invest in growth if that opportunity exists. Obviously, no one wants to see a company open a store that\u2019s gonna generate no business, so demand better be there or you can expect that chicken to come home and roost in the form of a writedown.\n\nWhen those growth options have been exhausted and if the stock appears to be trading below intrinsic value and if there\u2019s excess cash sitting on the balance sheet generating paltry returns (don\u2019t forget interest rates are at their lowest levels in decades), then buying back stock isn\u2019t a bad idea. Send that money to shareholders and let them figure out what to do with it.\n\nBy Sam Ro, managing editor.
