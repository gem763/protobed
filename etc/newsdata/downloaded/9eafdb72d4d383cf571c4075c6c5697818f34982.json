REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier\n\nLe Pen, leader of the former National Front, last year renamed the National Rally, hailed the appointment as an \u201cideological victory\u201d during a speech on Sunday in which she also mapped out her path to another presidential run in 2022.\n\nAddressing party faithful in the French Riviera town of Frejus, Le Pen sought to harness anti-government sentiment behind the country\u2019s \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests, with renewed pledges to improve purchasing power, halt or reverse privatisations and tackle rural decline.\n\nIncoming EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen drew fire this week for assigning the \u201cway of life\u201d job description to the new commissioner responsible for migration - with critics deriding the title as a far-right slogan.\n\nThe appointment \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d, said Le Pen, who has often criticized the European Union while stopping short of any vow to usher France out, amid limited \u201cFrexit\u201d support among voters.\n\n\u201cIt confirms our ideological victory,\u201d Le Pen said. Under pressure from national governments, she added, the European Union \u201chas been forced to admit that immigration poses questions about the future of Europeans\u2019 way of life.\u201d\n\nJean-Marie Le Pen, Marine\u2019s father and predecessor as National Front chief, was placed under investigation on Friday in a long-running French probe into the alleged misuse of European Parliament funds to pay party staff from 2009-2017.\n\nSince 2011, when Marine Le Pen assumed the leadership, the party has sought to broaden its appeal and trim its hard-right fringes, with mixed results.\n\nIn 2017, she failed to reach the second round of the presidential election - a feat her father had accomplished 15 years earlier, before losing the duel to Jacques Chirac. But her National Rally came top in France\u2019s May 26 European elections.\n\nLamenting the country\u2019s growing rural-urban divide on Sunday, Le Pen set out her pitch for France\u2019s March 2020 municipal elections and regional ballots the following year - including promises to nationalise infrastructure and adjust tax policy in favour of lower-income workers and regions.\n\n\u201cEach election is an opportunity for our political family to attach another carabiner on the slope leading up to the summit,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the summit is the Elysee.\u201d", "description": "French far-right opposition leader Marine Le Pen waded into controversy over the appointment of an EU Commissioner for \"protecting the European way of life\", endorsing a move that has stoked concern about rising populism across the continent.", "authors": ["Simon Carraud", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430187571&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0N4", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
