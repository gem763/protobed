In response, Iran stopped abiding by some commitments in the deal.\n\nThe EU has sought to salvage the accord but the Iranian tanker was seized because it was suspected of heading to Syria, which would breach EU sanctions on that country.\n\nThe Gibraltar authorities freed the vessel on 15 August after receiving assurances from Iran that it would not discharge its cargo in Syria.\n\nThe US has been seeking to seize the tanker since it was released by Gibraltar. It issued a warrant and blacklisted the vessel, threatening sanctions on any country which offered it aid. The ship has since been sailing east across the Mediterranean.\n\nEarlier this week it was revealed that a US official had even offered the captain of the ship millions of dollars to change course and sail the tanker to somewhere the US might be able to seize it.\n\nA British-flagged tanker was seized by Iran in July, in what was widely seen as retaliation for Britain's role in helping to seize the Iranian vessel - a link Tehran denies.\n\nThe Stena Impero was passing through the Strait of Hormuz when it was seized. It remains in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas.\n\nSeveral of the crew were freed earlier this week.", "description": "Despite a pledge it would not head there, satellite images appear to show an Iranian ship off Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/064F/production/_108651610_hi056144806.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
