Her daughter, Suzanne Kay, confirmed the news to Variety on Friday. The actress made her name as the first-ever African-American woman to star in her own television show, 1968\u2019s Julia. The show helped pave the way for more African-American talent onscreen. In 1962, Carroll became the first black woman to win a Best Actress Tony Award for her performance in Richard Rodgers\u2019s musical No Strings, written specifically for her. She earned her only Oscar nomination for the 1974 romance Claudine, opposite James Earl Jones. Carroll was the fourth black woman to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress. In the early \u201980s, she defined diva as the dramatic and elegant Dominique Deveraux on Dynasty, \u201cthe first black bitch on television,\u201d as Carroll once put it, paving the way for the Olivia Popes and Annalise Keatings of the world. \u201cYes, I\u2019m ambitious,\u201d Carroll wrote in her 2008 autobiography, The Legs Are the Last to Go, \u201ca rampant careerist who is as dedicated and vain as any performer in the business. I don\u2019t know if that will ever change.\u201d", "description": "Award winning actress and the first African-American woman to star on her own television show, Diahann Carroll has died at 84 years old, according to her daughter.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/04/04-diahann-carroll-death-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
