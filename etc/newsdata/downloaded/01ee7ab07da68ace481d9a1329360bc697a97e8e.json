Especially since the drama kicked off before cameras even started rolling \u2014 something that franchise alum, Colton Underwood, is no stranger to.\n\nThe former \u201cBachelor\u201d was one of the first to be involved in an off-camera relationship with a fellow Bachelor Nation alum, Tia Booth, before he competed for Becca Kufrin\u2019s heart on season 14 of \u201cThe Bachelorette.\u201d But even after setting a precedent for off-camera romances, like Blake Horstmann\u2019s infamous Stagecoach hookups, Underwood maintains that the growing tendency to connect with other contestants before the show isn\u2019t bad, it\u2019s just different.\n\n\u201cIt definitely adds a different dynamic to [the show], and it definitely does add a little more drama,\u201d Underwood tells Yahoo Lifestyle while celebrating the NFL kickoff with Yahoo Sports. \u201cBut as long as people\u2019s intentions and the reasons of linking up or connecting before are pure, then there\u2019s no problem with it.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the 27-year-old, who flipped the script of the show during his own \u201cBachelor\u201d season by gaining a girlfriend instead of a fianc\u00e9e, suggests that the drama is a necessary means to the show\u2019s romantic end. Although it nearly became too difficult for him to handle.\n\n\u201cYou have to go along with the show. That was what got hard for me. I almost got to a point where I felt like I was cheating on Cassie. So I just couldn\u2019t keep doing it anymore. And then I jumped a fence to get away\u2026\u201d he jokes, before offering advice to the future \u201cBachelor.\u201d \u201cBut I think as long as they stay true to their feelings and they really just trust their gut and trust their heart [...] they won\u2019t have to try to trick producers or anything. They really just have their feelings and their truth.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, the former NFL player says that the journey of handing out roses isn\u2019t much different than creating a lineup for his fantasy football league.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re narrowing it down, you have to do your homework, you have to put the work in,\u201d Underwood says. \u201cBut to be honest with you, it all comes down to chemistry.\u201d\n\nLuckily, he found that chemistry with his girlfriend, Cassie Randolph, who even lets it slide when Underwood sneaks the Yahoo Sports app onto his phone during a date.\n\n\u201cYou can watch the game anywhere and I have a very on-the-go, active lifestyle,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the fact that I can maybe even sometimes be on a dinner date, sneak away and watch the game is very, very helpful.\u201d\n\nWatch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
