What would I do with a limit of five?\u201d Having now taken on this challenge, along with all my fellow contributors to a special issue of Feast this week, I can happily report that the folks at the Ottolenghi test kitchen actually enjoyed the restriction.\n\nExcluding a few staples (fat, sugar, salt and pepper), the rule of five liberated us from any notion of \u201can extra pinch of this or maybe some of that\u201d \u2013 which, I have to confess, turned out to be a welcome relief. So, for today, at least, less is more.\n\nBlack pepper chicken with soy butter and lots of garlic\n\nSoy emulsified with butter makes a rich and glossy sauce that elevates what is essentially a humble stir-fry (which you could also make with sirloin steak, if you prefer, cut and cooked in exactly the same way).\n\nI urge you to try it \u2013 just make sure you whisk the butter into the sauce at the lowest possible temperature, because it will split if you let it boil. Don\u2019t leave the sauce to sit around for too long, either, because it won\u2019t hold together for more than about 20 minutes. Serve with sticky rice or noodles.\n\nPrep 15 min\n\nCook 50 min\n\nServes 4\n\n700g skinned chicken breasts (ie, 4-6 breasts), cut into \u00bccm-thick strips (freeze the chicken for half an hour first, to make it easier to cut)\n\n75ml soy sauce\n\n10 garlic cloves, peeled, 3 crushed, the rest thinly sliced\n\n1\u00bc tsp black peppercorns, coarsely crushed in a mortar, plus a little extra to garnish\n\n60ml sunflower oil\n\n40g cornflour\n\n2 tsp caster sugar\n\n600g choi sum, leaves left whole and stems cut into 5-6cm lengths\n\nSalt\n\n140g fridge-cold unsalted butter, cut into 2cm cubes\n\nPut the sliced chicken in a bowl and add two tablespoons of the soy sauce, all the crushed garlic and half the crushed pepper. Toss to coat, then leave the chicken to marinate for at least 15 minutes and up to an hour.\n\nWhile the chicken is marinating, put the oil and sliced garlic in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Cook, stirring regularly, for seven to eight minutes, until the garlic is golden. Strain through a sieve set over a bowl, to catch the garlic-infused oil, and reserve the fried garlic slices, too. Wipe out the pan with kitchen towel, because you\u2019ll be using it again later.\n\nAdd half the cornflour to the chicken bowl and mix well to combine. Leave this to sit for another two minutes, by which time the cornflour will have been mostly absorbed into the mix. Now add the rest of the cornflour and all the sugar, and mix again to combine.\n\nPour two and half tablespoons of the reserved garlic oil into the wiped-clean saute pan and put on a high heat. Once the oil is very hot, add a third of the chicken, and cook, stirring continuously to keep the strips from clumping, until nicely browned and crisp \u2013 about three minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the rest of the chicken, cooking a third of it at a time.\n\nOnce all the chicken is cooked and on the plate, add the remaining garlic oil to the pan, stir in the chopped choi sum stems and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and fry on a high heat for five minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly coloured. Now add the choi sum leaves and stir-fry until wilted \u2013 about two minutes more.\n\nReturn the chicken to the pan, heat through for another two minutes, then keep warm until you\u2019re ready to serve.\n\nNow make the soy butter sauce. Put the remaining three tablespoons of soy sauce, the rest of the crushed pepper and two and a half tablespoons of water in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, turn down to a simmer for three minutes, then turn the heat to its lowest setting. Whisk in two or three butter cubes and, once they\u2019ve melted, add two or three more cubes, and repeat, whisking continuously, until all the butter has been incorporated and you are left with a thick, homogenised sauce.\n\nTo serve, transfer the chicken stir-fry to a large platter and pour over the soy butter sauce. Top with the crisp garlic slices and a little extra crushed black pepper, and serve warm.\n\nCrispy cheese and mustard cauliflower bites\n\nThese are like a mustardy, bite-sized cauliflower cheese. They\u2019re great as they are, but a sprinkle of paprika, a squeeze of lemon and some mayo would do no harm (though that might be construed as cheating).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s crispy cheese and mustard cauliflower bites.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 35 min\n\nServes 4 as a snack\n\n2 large eggs, plus 2 yolks\n\n2\u00bd tbsp English mustard (Colman\u2019s, ideally), plus 2 tbsp extra to serve\n\n70g panko breadcrumbs\n\n70g parmesan, finely grated, plus extra to serve\n\nFlaked sea salt and black pepper\n\nSunflower oil, for frying\n\n1 large cauliflower, trimmed and cut into bite-sized florets (750g net weight)\n\nIn a medium bowl, beat the eggs, egg yolks and mustard until smooth. In a second medium bowl, combine the panko, parmesan, a small pinch of flaked salt and plenty of pepper.\n\nPour enough sunflower oil into a medium saute pan to come 5cm up its sides and put on a medium-high heat. Dip each cauliflower floret first in the egg bowl and then in the panko bowl, until well coated. Once the oil is hot, fry the florets in four batches, until cooked through and golden \u2013 about five minutes for each batch. Transfer to a tray lined with kitchen paper to drain, and keep warm in a low oven while you fry the remaining batches of cauliflower.\n\nPile the fried cauliflower on to a large plate and sprinkle generously with flaked salt and a good amount of grated parmesan. Serve warm, with extra mustard for dipping.\n\nOrzo pilaf with fennel and dill\n\nThis is a super-easy vegan main course to add to your repertoire. If you fancy adding dairy (and an extra ingredient), sprinkle some grated gruy\u00e8re or cheddar over the top towards the end of the cooking time and return the pot to the oven until it\u2019s melted and bubbling.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s orzo pilaf with fennel and dill.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 65 min\n\nServes 2 as a main, or 4 as a side\n\n3 fennel bulbs (800g in total), trimmed and each bulb cut into 6 wedges\n\n60ml olive oil\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n700ml vegetable stock\n\n100ml white wine\n\n15g dill, roughly chopped, plus 1 tbsp extra, chopped, to serve\n\n250g orzo\n\nHeat the oven to 250C (230C fan)/ gas 9+. Put the fennel, two and a half tablespoons of the oil, a third of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper into a large, oven-proof saute pan for which you have a lid. Toss to coat, then pour in 100ml vegetable stock, transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 30 minutes, stirring a couple of times, until the fennel is soft and well browned. Remove from the oven and turn down the heat to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.\n\nAdd the wine, dill, orzo, remaining stock, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt and a good grind of pepper to the pan, and stir everything together. Cover the pot with a lid and return to the oven for 20 minutes, or until the orzo is cooked through and most of the liquid has been absorbed.\n\nRemove the lid and return to the oven for eight minutes more, until the pasta mix is golden around the edges. Sprinkle the extra dill and the remaining tablespoon and a half of oil all over the top and serve warm.", "description": "Irresistible, five-ingredient recipes for black pepper chicken with soy butter, cheesy cauliflower bites and a herby orzo pilaf", "authors": ["Yotam Ottolenghi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9ec0e213121b3f11a054019ab65dc0693b7802/182_1696_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=33eb1ca33a785e9a7a4dc17032e1a29f", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
