But the story of this athlete began well before that in a village called Voosavanipeta, in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nKarnam was one of 5 sisters. All of them are trained in weightlifting. Her journey started at 12 when she began practicing in a thatched hut under coach Neelamshetty Appanna. Soon she moved to Delhi and the Sports Authority of India saw her perform. From there onwards there was no looking back.\n\nPTI\n\nIn 1990, she joined the national camp. Four years later she won the world title in the 54kg category. She repeated that feat in 1995 and was placed 3rd in 1993 and 1996. But it does not end there. The 1994 World Championships saw her secure a silver, in 1995 she became the Asian Champion and it was only a precursor of things to come.\n\nDon't Miss 38.9 K SHARES 11.2 K SHARES 8.2 K SHARES 2.4 K SHARES 631 SHARES\n\nEven before Karnam won an Olympic medal, she had already won the world title twice and had 29 international medals to her name of which 11 were gold.

After settling down and starting a family, she was planning a comeback at the 2002 Commonwealth Games but had to withdraw as her father passed away. In 2004 she failed to impress at the Olympics and announced her retirement.\n\nWhile she stays away from the public eye right now, her legacy will be hard to match. Karnam has sealed her place in history in putting Indian weightlifting back on the map. Now we can only go forward.", "description": "When Karnam Malleswari clinched bronze at the 2000 Olympics in weighlifting, she created history as the first Indian female athlete to win a medal at the Games.
