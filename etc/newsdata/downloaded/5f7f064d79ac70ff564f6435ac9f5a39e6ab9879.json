We\u2019ll split the analysis into three groups: very cheap, mid-tier, and expensive. A greater emphasis will be placed on the lower end of the price scale.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value.

They lasted seven and six innings respectively. The overall profile isn\u2019t especially awe inspiring. He doesn\u2019t induce many whiffs, his command and control are roughly league average, and his stuff doesn\u2019t limit hard contact or make hitters uncomfortable. In short, he\u2019s a spot starter. He\u2019s also priced so cheaply that it won\u2019t take much for him to return value. Aside from a certain Mr. Yelich, the Brewers lineup hasn\u2019t exactly torn through opponents. They\u2019re a roughly league average offense.\n\nTrent Grisham \u2013OF \u2013 Milwaukee Brewers (at Robert Dugger)\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer to bet against Dugger\u2019s mediocre skills, Grisham figures to be a useful foil. The 22-year-old crushed minor league pitching this season, but he\u2019s scuffled since reaching the majors. He\u2019s hitting just .222/.294/.389 with four home runs in 102 plate appearances. He\u2019s posted baffling strikeout (28.4%) and walk rates (7.8%) given his reputation for above average plate discipline and contact skills. A start against a Triple-A quality pitcher should help him kick into full gear. He usually bats leadoff.\n\nAbraham Toro \u2013 3B \u2013 Houston Astros (vs Mike Fiers)\n\nToro has struggled to lift the ball since reaching the upper minors. He makes a lot of pulled, ground ball contact which helps to explain his current .265 BABIP (in a small sample of 55 PA). Besides the grounders, Toro has shown a major league skill set with plenty of plate discipline and contact ability. It\u2019s just a matter of making some small adjustments. He has the fortune of facing a fly ball pitcher in Fiers. This should help with his launch angle problem \u2013 perhaps enough to furnish a home run.\n\nJaylin Davis \u2013 OF \u2013 San Francisco Giants (vs Trevor Williams)\n\nDavis is one of the most interesting virtually unknown players to come out of the minors this season. In two Triple-A stops split between the Twins and the Giants, he posted a near-50 percent home run to fly ball ratio (HR/FB). For context, the best major league hitters top out around a 33 percent HR/FB. Davis is an extreme ground ball hitter who pummels the ball. By batted ball profile, I\u2019m reminded of pre-breakout Christian Yelich. However, it should be noted that Davis lacks many of Yelich\u2019s best qualities \u2013 especially plate discipline and contact rate. Williams isn\u2019t known for allowing oodles of fly balls, but he does throw his share of clunkers. A few of the Pirates relievers are fly ball pitchers. Mostly, Davis is interesting for a chance to catch lightning.\n\nAlso Consider: Trevor Williams, Jaylin Davis, Travis Shaw, Isan Diaz, Abraham Toro, Anthony Bemboom, Luis Urias, Seth Brown, Josh Rojas, Nick Martini, Cory Spangenberg, Brandon Nimmo\n\nMID-TIER MUST PLAYS\n\nMichael Brantley \u2013 OF \u2013 Houston Astros (vs Mike Fiers)\n\nIf I have one regret this season, it\u2019s that I\u2019ve not used Brantley often enough. One of the most consistent hitters in baseball, he\u2019s frequently overshadowed by his toolsier teammates. Tonight, he finds himself with an advantageous pairing against Fiers and a bizarrely cheap price tag. Like Toro, Brantley is a ground ball hitter. Advantage hitter. He has an elevated chance to homer coupled with myriad other ways to supply DFS value.\n\nAlso Consider: Zack Grienke, Franmil Reyes, Gleyber Torres, Yasiel Puig, Aaron Judge, Michael Conforto\n\nHIGH PRICED VALUES\n\nJacob deGrom \u2013 SP \u2013 New York Mets (vs Diamondbacks)\n\nSome plays are too obvious. And sometimes it\u2019s nearly impossible to avoid these obvious choices. deGrom represents an excellent example of a too-obvious must-play. He\u2019s the best pitcher in the slate by a wide margin, and he\u2019s priced extremely affordably. Only a handful of players are a better dollar-for-dollar value tonight, and most of them are bargain basement, poorly-projected hitters.\n\ndeGrom\u2019s matchup against the Diamondbacks is reasonably favorable. The Arizona offense is 11 percent below league average against right-handed pitching \u2013 most of whom don\u2019t hold a candle to deGrom. While they\u2019re not especially strikeout prone, we can still expect around seven innings and 8.5 strikeouts from the Mets\u2019 ace. As an added bonus, CitiField is one of the most pitcher friendly parks in the league.\n\nAlso Consider: Yordan Alvarez, Pete Alonso", "description": "Brad Johnson reviews his favorite MLB DFS bargain targets for Monday, September 9.
