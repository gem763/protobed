Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, pauses during a hearing Wednesday on Capitol Hill. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\nLawmakers on Thursday pressed top officials at the Federal Aviation Administration about why the agency has not moved faster to implement key consumer protection and aviation safety measures approved last year as part of a five-year agreement to fund the agency.\n\nAmong the measures lawmakers asked about was a mandate on rest time for flight attendants.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Federal Aviation Administration has made some progress on fulfilling the law\u2019s directives, ongoing implementation delays threaten the important work needed to advance U.S. aviation and aerospace and maintain our global leadership,\u201d said Rep. Rick Larsen, (D-Wash.), chairman of the House Transportation subcommittee on aviation.\n\nThe agency has missed several key deadlines to implement mandates outlined in the FAA reauthorization legislation passed last year.\n\nDeputy FAA Administrator Daniel K. Elwell acknowledged that many mandates required action within a year. But he said the sheer volume of mandates, plus other demands, forced the agency to prioritize its work.\n\nThe 2018 legislation, he said, was the \u201cmost comprehensive aviation reauthorization measure enacted in over 30 years,\u201d and requires 33 separate rules.\n\nHe reassured lawmakers that the FAA remained committed to completing its work as quickly as possible.\n\n[Senate gives final approval for FAA reauthorization, sends bill to White House]\n\nElwell said in some cases, the rulemaking process, which requires a comment period and the gathering of data from stakeholders, had slowed efforts. But he said the agency was making progress.\n\nLegislators, however, seemed skeptical.\n\nThroughout the hearing, members demanded to know why rules requiring airlines to give flight attendants a 10-hour rest period between flights and the installation of secondary cockpit barriers on new aircraft had not been implemented.\n\nThe legislation had given the secretary of transportation a Nov. 4, 2018, deadline to issue a final rule that would guarantee rest time for flight attendants. Elwell was unable to say Thursday when the rule would be implemented.\n\n\u201cWhen deadlines are in the law and deadlines are not adhered to, it causes great frustration,\u201d said Rep. Garret Graves (La.), the ranking Republican on the subcommittee.\n\nLawmakers also pushed for answers on why efforts to create a registration system for unmanned aircraft systems, or drones, appeared stalled, even though the FAA started the rulemaking process last year.\n\nElwell said such an effort is a complex undertaking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a realist,\u201d said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, (D-Ore.) chairman of the House Transportation Committee. \u201cI recognize it will take time for the FAA and the [Transportation Department] to work through the list.\u201d\n\nDeFazio said he would be closely monitoring the agency\u2019s progress on key elements, including rest time for flight attendants and the mandate that the FAA examine seat sizes.\n\nDeFazio and other lawmakers said that at a time when Americans are growing bigger and airplane seats are shrinking, the 2018 legislation directed the FAA to reevaluate whether smaller seats pose a safety hazard in the event that a plane must be evacuated. The measure called on the agency to reassess whether aircraft can still be safely evacuated in 90 seconds.\n\nElwell said officials are planning a 12-day exercise in November on airplane evacuations.\n\nHe emphasized that the FAA has moved forward in several key areas, including the establishment of a Safety Oversight and Certification Advisory Committee to advise the secretary on issues related to the FAA\u2019s safety oversight and certification programs.\n\nIn March, he said, the agency formally established an Organization Designation Authorization Office within its Office of Aviation Safety to ensure consistency within a program that gives companies broad authority to oversee their own safety.\n\nBoth programs have come under increased scrutiny following the crashes of two Boeing 737 Max jets in less than five months, which killed 346 people.\n\nRead more:\n\nFAA reauthorization offers some wins for consumers\n\nFAA says: We\u2019re a safety agency, not a creature comfort agency\n\nWill FAA come to the rescue of cramped fliers?\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "House hearing focused on implementation rest rules for flight attendants, drones and seat sizes on airplanes.", "authors": ["Lori Aratani", "Reporter Focusing On Transportation Issues", "Including Airports", "Airlines", "The Nation'S Railroad", "Subway Systems", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TBvQfhIS4RHfNQudsN1lW7Tvapk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUJ3LRG73MI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
