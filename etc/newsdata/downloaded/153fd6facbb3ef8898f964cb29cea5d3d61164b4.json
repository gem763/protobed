She seemed pretty peeved, angry, & hostile when she was in America.\ud83d\ude09 \u2014 MC1Republican\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\ude82\ud83d\ude83\ud83d\ude8b\ud83d\ude83\ud83d\udc18\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f (@Zurchmom) October 4, 2019\n\nPoorly informed is too kind \u2014 Dash Riprock (@19JB60) October 3, 2019\n\nAnother netizen joked that Greta\u2019s comeback had \u201chit Putin so hard [that] he has gone into hiding.\u201d\n\nThunberg employed a similar tactic after Trump poked fun at her controversial address at a UN climate summit held at the end of September in New York.\n\n\u201cA very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\u201d her profile previously stated, mirroring the needling comments made by the US president.\n\nThe sarcastic bio update was hailed by the anti-Trump Twitterati as a masterpiece of internet trolling.\n\nAlso on rt.com Greta gets the last laugh?
