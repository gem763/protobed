Frequent, spontaneous arousal and performance are not so frequent, less arousing, and less satisfying. If you\u2019ve tried any of Big Pharma's so-called solutions\u2014Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, and so on\u2014then you know they can come with a\n\nWho really needs a male sexual enhancement boost?\n\nhost of nasty side effects . So, if you wish there were a safe, natural male enhancement solution\u2014a fixer-upper (or upper fixer?) you're in the right place. But\u2026Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a legitimate medical issue for millions of men, and the dominant Big Pharma medications are household names for a reason: the benefits seem worth the trouble\u2014the headaches, dizziness, nasal congestion, racing pulse, pre-planning, waiting time, and so on. But there's medical need\u2026and there's just wanting a more satisfying sex life. As I mentioned, life after 40 isn't like the good old days. That doesn't mean they're bad days, and doesn't mean they can't get better. So when there are safe, natural, pleasure enhancing alternatives that work perfectly well\u2014without the trouble\u2014I say go for it. Especially when what's good for your sex life is good for the entire body, and vice versa. And in some cases, an unexpected outcome can be a real blessing. Atherosclerosis, for example, causes blood-restricting fatty deposits to build up inside the arteries\u2014including those that supply the penis. Those buildups can lead to ED-type symptoms\u2014troublesome in themselves, but also maybe an invaluable warning mechanism. Because the small vessels that supply the penis are affected much sooner than the larger vessels leading to the heart, ED in younger middle-aged men can be an early sign of atherosclerosis. Knowing that can mean making behavioral changes that head off danger before it arrives. Which reminds me to remind you that taking good care of yourself\u2014healthy diet, exercise, meditation\u2014is your best assurance of good emotional and cardiovascular health, which are intimately linked to a good sex life.\n\nSex chemistry 101\n\nOur bountiful planet comes through once again with a plant extract called pycnogenol . It works with l-arginine to lift that success rate from 12 to as high as 80 percent. And unlike the one-time meds you take when you're planning to have sex, and which wear off in time, the longer a man takes a daily supplement with both pycnogenol and l-arginine, the more the benefits add up. An Italian study clearly showed that overall satisfaction was significantly higher after three months, and higher still after six months. As an added bonus, pycnogenol is also a powerful antioxidant. What's not to like? You can take 150 miligrams daily, and safely boost that up as far as 450 miligrams.\n\n. It works with l-arginine to lift that success rate from 12 to as high as 80 percent.

L-citrulline is an amino acid that supports healthy circulation for sexual/erectile function by helping in the creation of that nitric oxide you read about earlier. Now throw in the welcome systemic benefits\u2014a healthy arterial and cardiovascular system overall, and antioxidant powers to reduce bad LDL cholesterol. This is good medicine\u2014natural, safe, and proven effective and side-effects free. Try 1.5 grams a day.\n\nis an amino acid that supports healthy circulation for sexual/erectile function by helping in the creation of that nitric oxide you read about earlier.

So it's had plenty of time to be studied extensively for its broad-spectrum benefits, including as an aphrodisiac and male performance enhancer. Research has found that it can help boost healthy testosterone levels, essential for sexual health, energy, endurance and overall well-being, especially as we age. Aim for 675 mg daily.\n\nis another plant-based healer that's been around forever.

A 2008 lab study found that a compound in the herb horny goat weed neutralizes an enzyme that slows the healthy blood flow you need for satisfying sex\u2014an effect similar to some Big Pharma drugs. Indeed, there was evidence that horny goat weed works better than those drugs, and with fewer side effects. I recommend 900 mg daily per 150 pounds of body weight.\n\nneutralizes an enzyme that slows the healthy blood flow you need for satisfying sex\u2014an effect similar to some Big Pharma drugs.

The bark of a tree grown in western Africa, yohimbe , gives us an extract long considered a natural male enhancement ingredient. It increases blood flow, as do Big Pharma's offerings, so effectively that higher doses are available by prescription, as well as over the counter. I recommend 2.5\u20135 mg daily to start, a little more at a time if you see no improvement.\n\n, gives us an extract long considered a natural male enhancement ingredient.

It's also one of the essential health-makers that almost every patient I see is deficient in. If you're a D-deficient man, you're prone to low testosterone and reduced sex drive. If you're a D-deficient woman, it can cause low estrogen, which can mean low sex drive. So, if you\u2019re looking to get \u201cbusier\u201d, be sure you both have adequate levels of D. There's a simple test to find out. If you're moderately deficient, I recommend 1,500 IUs per day, man, woman, and child. Very deficient? Up to 4,000 IUs of vitamin D daily, and up to 30 minutes of direct sunlight.\n\nis the beloved \"sunshine vitamin\" that our bodies produce with the help of the sun.

DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a hormone our bodies make that contributes to creation of sex hormones, including testosterone and estrogen. Our levels of these hormones begin to decline at age 30 or so. DHEA supplements, with the same vasodilator effect as Big Pharma and other herbal offerings, can help ensure testosterone levels are high enough for great sex. Try 25\u201350 mg daily, depending on your size, and aim for a lab test result of 250 mg present in your system. Do not take DHEA if you have cardiovascular problems.\n\n(dehydroepiandrosterone) is a hormone our bodies make that contributes to creation of sex hormones, including testosterone and estrogen.

A 2012 study of Tongkat Ali, a traditional Malaysian remedy for men experiencing flagging sexual performance, gave the herb to a group of men, only 35 percent of whom had normal testosterone levels. After one month, the percentage of men with normal levels jumped to more than 90 percent. A different study found that men who consumed Tongkat Ali daily experienced improvements in erectile function, libido, and volume of ejaculate. Try 200\u2013450 mg daily.\n\nSome prescription meds and the supplements I recommend to my patients share a common ingredient: the amino acid l-arginine. It serves as a vasodilator that becomes the gas nitric oxide (NO)\u2014which gently, naturally relaxes all of your blood vessels, including those in the penis, where you want a strong flow of oxygen-rich blood. Problem: Only about 12 percent of men using l-arginine reported successful results in one study. Solution: Teamwork.\n\nA plethora of much better choices\n\nThe market is flooded with cheap, dangerous frauds. Many include what are called analogues of the same potent ingredients as in Big Pharma's offerings, created by ingenious but diabolically unscrupulous chemists. These analogues often appear in potentially deadly overdose levels, and are often accompanied by useless or dangerous other drugs, such as those for treating diabetes. If there's an upside to these frauds, it's that they almost always have ridiculous names, like Mojo Rising or Night Boom. Do not go there. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to ensure the manufacturer and the formulations of any options are legitimate. As with any supplement, there can be dangerous, unwanted interactions between even the most reputable supplements and any other prescription or OTC meds you're taking.\n\nReferences\n\nThis should give you plenty of options. Be sure to discuss your situation with your doctor before trying or changing any supplement(s). And please, be acutely aware of two things:Healthy help is here if you're careful.
