Fortescue and SMB-Winning have bid to develop the mine.\n\nZogota, a nearby iron ore deposit owned by former Xstrata boss Mick Davis\u2019 Niron Metals, has already negotiated an agreement to export through Liberia.\n\nBut Nimba and Zogota still need to reach agreements with Germany\u2019s ArcelorMittal, the sole rail concession holder in Liberia, to allow them to use its infrastructure.\n\nArcelorMittal declined to provide an immediate comment.", "description": "Guinea and Liberia signed a deal on Friday to allow several mines in Guinea, including the giant Nimba iron ore project, to export through Liberia, officials from the West African countries said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
