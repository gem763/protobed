(AP)\n\nBut while the names have changed \u2013 that 2004 Twins team featured Johan Santana and Torii Hunter and was managed by Ron Gardenhire \u2013 the results have stayed remarkably consistent.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs they have in four previous Octobers over the past 15 years, the Yankees dominated the Twins in virtually every aspect of the game. The only area in which the two battled to a draw was in the performance of their starters, with both the Yankees James Paxton and the Twins Jose Berrios allowing three runs, and neither being able to complete five innings.\n\nOther than that, it was all Yankees.\n\nWhile Twins\u2019 first baseman C.J. Cron was botching the relay on what should have been an inning-ending double play, allowing two unearned runs to score in the third, Judge was making a pair of diving catches, the second of which bailed out Zack Britton, one of six relievers used by Boone.\n\nWhile the Twins bullpen was taking a tight game and turning it into a laugher \u2013 the Yankees final five runs were scored off a pair of Twins relievers, Kyle Gibson and Cody Stashak \u2013 the Yankees bullpen, asked to get the final 13 outs of the game after Paxton was pulled with two outs in the fifth, allowed one run and just two hits the rest of the way.\n\nAnd while the Twins offense did what it does best, hit the ball out of the ballpark, their three home runs (by Jorge Polanco, Nelson Cruz and Sano) were all relatively harmless solo shots. Despite getting runners into scoring position in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth innings, the Twins were never able to come up with the big hit they needed to keep the game close.\n\nThe biggest hit of the night came from the youngest Yankee, Torres, who the Yankees acquired in a trade deadline deal with the Chicago Cubs in exchange for their closer, Aroldis Chapman, in 2016. That deal may well have gotten the Cubs their first World Championship in 108 years. Now, three years later, that same deal could return the favor for the Yankees. (They also re-acquired Chapman that off-season as a free agent, one of Yankee GM Brian Cashman\u2019s most impressive coups.)\n\nIn his second full big-league season, Torres, who had been projected as a line-drive hitter in the mold of Derek Jeter, exploded into a legitimate power threat, leading the team with 38 home runs.\n\nBut it is the poise of this 22-year-old from Caracas, Venezuela, that has most impressed his teammates. \u201cNo situation is too big for him,\u2019\u2019 said D.J. LeMahieu, who homered in the sixth and cleared the bases with a double in the seventh. \u201cHe\u2019s an impressive player.\u2019\u2019\n\nAaron Judge dives to make the catch during the third inning of the ALDS Game 1 between the Minnesota Twins and the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. (Getty Images)\n\nTorres\u2019 at-bat in the fifth off Tyler Duffey, a right-hander and probably the most dominant arm in the Twins bullpen, was the highlight of the game. After falling behind 0-2, Torres worked the count full, laying off a slider that easily could have been strike three. He barely got a piece of the next slider, and then turned on a 96-MPH fastball and sent a rocket that caromed off Sano\u2019s glove into foul territory.\n\n\u201cI never feel panic, I just try to put the ball into play,\u2019\u2019 Torres said. \u201cI was just waiting for a fastball. He throws it, and I do that.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe hit was especially sweet for Torres because in his previous at-bat, against Berrios, he had hit the same grounder to Sano that should have ended the inning on a double play. Even though two runs scored on Cron\u2019s error at first, Torres knew he hadn\u2019t really done his job.\n\n\u201cThat is the thing that is beautiful about baseball,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cYou always get a second opportunity.\u2019\u2019\n\nTorres might also have been referring to his previous playoff appearance, when he made the last out of the Yankees 2018 ALDS challenge to the Boston Red Sox, grounding to third with the tying run at second base.\n\n\u201cI felt really bad because I made that last out,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cI never forgot that moment. But I took it as an experience for me and took advantage of that moment tonight. It\u2019s all about helping my team.\u2019\u2019\n\nTorres is too young to know it, but his team has never needed a lot of help in beating the Twins in October. And considering the way the two teams looked on Friday, he could be a grizzled old veteran by the time they do.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The New York Yankees haven't lost to the Twins in the playoffs in more than 15 years.
