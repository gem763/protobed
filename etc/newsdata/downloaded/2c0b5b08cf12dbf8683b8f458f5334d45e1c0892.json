As far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\nThe chief envoy to the talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, said last week that an agreement \u201cin principle\u201d had been reached, under which the United States would partially withdraw its troops from Afghanistan in exchange for the Taliban renouncing al-Qaeda, which had orchestrated the 2001 attacks.\n\nU.S. officials expected the tentative agreement to advance a comprehensive cease-fire and talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. But after attacks and bombings by the Taliban, including one that killed a U.S. soldier, further talks over ending the 18-year conflict began to waver.\n\nTrump abruptly announced on Twitter Saturday night that he had \u201ccalled off peace negotiations\u201d after the Taliban took responsibility for the attack.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey didn\u2019t, they only made it worse!\u201d\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle sharply criticized Trump over the weekend for inviting Taliban leadership to Camp David.\n\nOn Monday, Trump defended his invitation, arguing that wars would \u201cgo on forever\u201d without meetings.\n\n\u201cI took my own advice. I liked the idea of meeting. I\u2019ve met with a lot of bad people and a lot of good people\u201d since becoming president, he said.\n\nHaving the meeting at the White House would have been \u201ca step too far,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I thought Camp David would be good, and I still do.\u201d\n\nThe president also pushed back against a report that Vice President Pence and national security adviser John Bolton had urged him to call off the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe had a meeting scheduled,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was my idea. And it was my idea to terminate it.\u201d\n\nShortly before Trump addressed reporters, Pence echoed the president\u2019s claim that the report was \u201cfake news\u201d in a tweet that bore many similarities to Trump\u2019s own style.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Absolutely Right Mr. President,\u201d Pence tweeted. \u201cMore Fake News! The Dishonest Media never contacted our office before running with this story and if they had, we would have told them I FULLY support your decision.\u201d\n\nNBC News, the outlet that broke the story, had reported Sunday that Pence\u2019s office and a Trump spokesman did not immediately respond to its requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement late Monday afternoon, Darin Miller, a spokesman for Pence, also pushed back against the notion of infighting within Trump\u2019s administration over Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President reserves his counsel for the President, and anyone claiming to know his thoughts on the matter aside from the President is mistaken,\u201d he said.\n\nKaren DeYoung and Ashley Parker contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cWe had a meeting scheduled.
