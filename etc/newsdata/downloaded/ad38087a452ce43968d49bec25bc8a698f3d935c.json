Gerard Moreno has made an excellent start to the Spanish league season, scoring six goals in seven matches.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid strikers \u00c1lvaro Morata and Diego Costa were both left off the squad. Moreno will join Rodrigo Moreno and Mikel Oyarzabal in attack.\n\nMorata was left at home despite having recovered from a knee injury that had sidelined him for three matches with Atl\u00e9tico.\n\nPaco Alc\u00e1cer is unavailable because of an Achilles\u2019 tendon problem. He had scored twice in limited minutes at the end of Spain\u2019s last match, a 4-0 victory over the Faeroe Islands.\n\nMoreno also called up 22-year-old defenders Sergio Reguil\u00f3n and Pau Torres for the first time. Reguil\u00f3n could start at left back with Jordi Alba and Jos\u00e9 Gaya injured.\n\nRa\u00fal Albiol, a 34-year-old veteran with 52 international appearances, has also returned after a one-year absence. He is the fourth player from Villarreal on the squad, along with Santi Cazorla.\n\nSpain plays Norway in Oslo on Oct. 12, and three days later visits Sweden in Solna.\n\nSpain leads Group F with 18 points after winning all six of its matches. Sweden is second with 11 points. Norway is in fourth place behind Romania with nine.\n\n___\n\nSpain:\n\nGoalkeepers: David de Gea (Manchester United), Kepa Arrizabalaga (Chelsea), Pau L\u00f3pez (Roma)\n\nDefenders: Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid), Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid), Juan Bernat (Paris Saint-Germain), Jes\u00fas Navas (Sevilla), Sergio Reguil\u00f3n (Sevilla), Ra\u00fal Albiol (Villarreal), Pau Torres (Villarreal), Diego Llorente (Real Sociedad), \u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez (Athletic Bilbao)\n\nMidfielders: Sergio Busquets (Barcelona), Rodrigo Hern\u00e1ndez (Manchester City), Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz (Napoli), Thiago Alc\u00e1ntara (Bayern Munich), Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez (Atl\u00e9tico Madrid), Dani Ceballos (Arsenal), Santi Cazorla (Villarreal), Pablo Sarabia (Paris Saint-Germain), Luis Alberto (Lazio)\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gerard Moreno will have a chance to make his international debut when Spain plays at Norway and Sweden in upcoming European Championship qualifiers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/spain_soccer_la_liga_86213_c0-233-5569-3480_s1770x1032.jpg?62ce1f6c8657e23e91059c1dc960a8e2c5dc35a7", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
