They wrote to Cummings:\n\nYou decided to issue this subpoena without consulting Republicans and without allowing Members to debate the terms of the subpoena. Your memorandum cherry-picks and misstates information to propagate a misleading narrative about the President\u2019s actions. We object strongly to the issuance of this subpoena and your stated reasons for issuing it. If you proceed with this subpoena over our objections, you will be violating our bipartisan agreement about subpoenas, trampling on long-held minority rights in the House of Representatives, and proving the partisan nature of your inquiry.\n\nHouse Oversight Republicans noted that in January, Cummings promised to consult ranking member Jim Jordan (R-OH) before issuing subpoenas.\n\nCummings said, \u201cMembers deserve the opportunity to go on the record for some of the most important work they will do, and the public deserves the opportunity to see them do that work in the open.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans contended that by issuing this subpoena unilaterally and without a business meeting, Cummings continues to deny the American people transparency and accountability about the committee\u2019s oversight actions.\n\n\u201cHere, on the Committee\u2019s most important work-Democrats\u2019 self-described \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019-you have chosen to deny Members a meaningful opportunity to debate and amend your proposed subpoena,\u201d they added in the letter.\n\n\u201cLikewise, you have not articulated why, if Democrats intend to conduct an objective and even-handed inquiry, you cannot wait for Members to fully consider and vote on your subpoena when the House returns on October 15th,\u201d the Republicans added.\n\nRead the Oversight Republicans\u2019 letter to chairman Cummings here.\n\nSean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.
