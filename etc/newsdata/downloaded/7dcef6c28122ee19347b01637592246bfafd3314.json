U.S. Soccer filed its response to the request on Monday night.\n\nTwenty-eight players, including Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, sued U.S. Soccer in March alleging institutionalized gender discrimination that includes inequitable compensation compared to players on the men\u2019s national team.\n\nU.S. Soccer maintains that compensation for each team is the result of separate collective bargaining agreements, and that the pay structures are different as a result. Men\u2019s team players are paid largely by appearance and performance, while the contract for the women\u2019s team includes provisions for health care and other benefits, as well as salaries in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League.\n\nThe federation argued in its motion Monday that four players for the U.S. team - Morgan, Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd and Becky Sauerbrunn - were each paid more than the highest paid player on the men\u2019s national team in four years over the period between 2014-2019. The four earned more even when NWSL salaries were removed, the motion said.\n\nU.S. Soccer maintains that because those players made more they lack the standing to represent a class.\n\nRepresentatives for the players did not immediately respond to comment Monday night.\n\nThe motion says the four players made more in 2015, and then from 2017-2019 than the highest-paid men\u2019s player in each of those years.\n\nThe men\u2019s team did not make the field for the 2018 World Cup in Russia and had fewer matches, and therefore fewer call-ups and training camps from 2017-18. The team has also transitioned to new coach Gregg Berhalter, who was hired last December.\n\nThe women\u2019s team won this year\u2019s World Cup in France and had additional games leading up to the event, including qualification matches. The women also won the World Cup in 2015. The team also played in victory tour matches following those World Cup victories.\n\nThe lawsuit accused the federation of paying players on the women\u2019s team less than similarly situated male national team players on a per game basis.\n\nFollowing a failed attempt to mediate the matter, a May 5 trial date was set in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The U.S. Soccer Federation has filed a motion opposing the U.S. women's national team request to certify the players' lawsuit seeking equitable pay as a class action.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
