You may have been in the mood for a dance but we were in the mood for a show, as the Upside put on its gladrags and morphed into a live event, complete with panellists, a quiz and the odd joke or two.\n\nI\u2019ll set the scene: there was the biggest TV screen in Europe (though of course, soon it will merely be the biggest TV in Britain). There were 100 in the audience, wine in the green room and expertise primed to address the theme of the night: Why the world\u2019s not as bad as you might think.\n\nYomi Adegoke explained how to look on the bright side if, like her, you share the triple economic disadvantage of being a millennial, female and black. Helen Russell, who lives in one of the world\u2019s most agreeable countries, instructed us all in how to find happiness. Alice Snedden made us all laugh.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Rice-Oxley, left, chaired the panel next to speakers Yomi Adegoke and Professor Mark Maslin.

A global effort by 250 news organisations, including the Guardian, to boost climate coverage.\n\n2. A fishy alternative to plastic. 90-second read\n\n3. A plan to bring a billion people in from the dark. Two-minute read\n\n4. A new drive to suck back carbon and \u201crestore\u201d the climate: 10-year strategy\n\n5. And of course, millions of people on the streets. 24-hour action\n\nLucky numbers\n\nThe New York Times takes a forensic look at the mortality of children and finds that almost everywhere it is falling. Reuters meanwhile reported on a new measure in Indonesia to raise the age at which women can marry to curb child marriages.\n\nThe OECD said asylum requests fell sharply in 2018 (though we\u2019d need to find out precisely why before celebrating that as good news).\n\nAngel Gurr\u00eda (@A_Gurria) The 2019 #OECD Int #Migration Outlook helps us get the facts straight. People think there are far more migrants than there really are; inflows of permanent migrants in 2017&2018 were lower than in 2016; temporary migrants increased considerably, but contributed greatly to labour\n\nAnd record numbers of the poorest teenagers are getting into British universities.\n\nWhat we liked\n\nThe plumber who works free for disadvantaged people.\n\nAnd this gentle call in the Atlantic for a revival of the lost art of the telephone call.\n\nWhat we heard\n\nDanny Diskin wrote in from Brazil:\n\nI run a reforestation organisation partnering with rural schools in Brazil to build sapling nurseries, and restoring springs and river systems. Is this the kind of solutions you\u2019d like to hear more about?\n\nYes, definitely, Danny. Do keep us in touch with your progress.\n\nAnd David Dunn had a radical suggestion:\n\nWhen money was based with gold it was controlled in availability by how much gold was available. Today we need it based with natural resources to regain the link of worth and value which has been lost to history. Scrap all existing taxes and replace (them) with a single natural resource tax collected at source and based on the eco damage caused by their use and consumption plus UBI (universal basic income) and a wealth tax.\n\n\n\nWhere was the Upside?\n\nWith Team No-Side in Japan, as the rugby world cup gets underway. Also in England, with the world\u2019s largest hokey-cokey.\n\nAnd finally, with this delightful slice of absurdity in which emergency services take on the \u201cTetris challenge\u201d by unpacking every last bit of kit in their trucks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Flat out Photograph: Instagram\n\nIf there is a story, innovation or trailblazer you think we should report on, write to us at theupside@theguardian.com.", "description": "This week\u2019s Upside highlight was a live event in London \u2013 and a lot of environmental hope", "authors": ["Mark Rice-Oxley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f01fe0598f6ff3c80122b992ae26a3aed1ec73f/0_367_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=47655074550312149c857f1405b66465", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
