You would hope that something beautiful will happen.\n\n'What I do think is that XR, as a movement, we can't think it will become something that only campaigns twice a year.\n\n'The situation is far too serious and far too urgent. The clock is really ticking,' reports the Evening Standard.\n\nAnother activist said in a group chat: 'There will be other actions between now and Christmas focused on our climate message.\n\n'If the Government does not listen to us then we will have no choice but to take to the streets again, whether it's Trafalgar Square, Oxford Street or smaller direct actions.'\n\nAn XR spokesman said the campaign was set to continue and added: 'We aren't necessarily pausing, we do have plans for further action within the next couple of months.\n\n'We are in a moment now where what we are doing is necessary. We are running out of time and it is important to continue to carry out action.'", "description": "Climate change protestors claim they will target London's busy shopping and tourist hubs, including Oxford Circus and Trafalgar Square (pictured this month), over the festive period.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/13/19989594-0-image-a-47_1571660455353.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
