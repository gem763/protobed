That followed a campaign by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who singled her out for what he deemed an anti-Trump agenda.\n\n\u201dHe will be the first high-level State Department official we\u2019ve had since we\u2019re getting news that there was a concerted effort to fire the ambassador of Ukraine led by Rudy Giuliani,\u201d said Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask him a lot about what the hell\u2019s going on at the State Department.\u201d\n\nDemocrats on the panel will almost certainly use Sullivan\u2019s confirmation hearing to pursue the allegations at the heart of the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry -- that Trump held up U.S. aid and a promised White House meeting to extract a pledge from Ukraine\u2019s new president to investigate Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter as well as a conspiracy theory that Ukraine and Democrats, not Russia favoring Trump, interfered in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cOther people who\u2019ve been before us have been at regional desks where they wouldn\u2019t necessarily have known this,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cI\u2019m asking as somebody who\u2019s supposed to exercise oversight over the State Department.\u201d\n\nSullivan was mentioned by name in Yovanovitch\u2019s opening statement to the impeachment inquiry earlier this month. In Yovanovitch\u2019s telling, Sullivan broke the news that she was being recalled from her post early even though her original term wasn\u2019t up for a couple of months and had been extended through 2020 shortly before.\n\n\u201cHe added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the Department had been under pressure from the president to remove me since the Summer of 2018,\u201d Yovanovitch testified, according to her opening statement, which was made public. \u201cHe also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment connection, and Sullivan\u2019s senior position as Secretary of State Michael Pompeo\u2019s top deputy, is expected to result in a contentious hearing where Sullivan\u2019s qualifications for the job may be overshadowed.\n\n\u2018Accounting to Do\u2019\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s No. 2 at the State Department,\u201d said Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the committee. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot. From Russia to Ukraine to our ambassadors to political retaliation at the State Department, he has a lot of accounting to do.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s Republican chairman, Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, has refused to hold any hearings linked to Ukraine or allegations of impeachable offenses by the president. It will also be the first Russia-related hearing in the committee in more than two years.\n\nIn the Democratic-controlled House, the impeachment inquiry continues to take witness testimony behind closed doors as the full chamber prepares for a Thursday vote on an impeachment resolution. On Wednesday, two more State Department officials, Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, are scheduled to testify, according to a House official familiar with the hearing process. Croft and Anderson are Ukraine specialists.\n\nThe role of ambassador in Moscow is a largely thankless one in an administration whose policy toward Russia has been highly contradictory. Trump has repeatedly pledged to improve ties -- and in a summit in Helsinki, Finland last year appeared to back Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s vow that he didn\u2019t interfere with the 2016 election despite the assessment of the U.S. intelligence community that he did.\n\nTwelve Russian intelligence agents were indicted as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, and the U.S. slapped numerous sanctions and visa restrictions on Russia over its role in the election interference, as well as a nerve-agent attack on a former spy in the U.K.\n\nSullivan has led committees on counterterrorism and strategic security. Yet even an initiative to ease what both the U.S. and Russia call \u201cminor irritants\u201d has failed to produce any gains.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Lawmakers from both parties will get their first chance to publicly question an official with knowledge of events linked to the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, as they hear from the president\u2019s choice to be the next U.S. ambassador to Russia.It was John Sullivan, in his current", "authors": ["Nick Wadhams", "Daniel Flatley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/69rBu2iArsY4J4lobmVhJA--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/6b5a11468c57832b87a0733ceca902d0", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
