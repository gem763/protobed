Biden on Tuesday batted away questions about his son Hunter\u2019s sweetheart foreign business deals by saying the focus should be on President Trump\u2019s corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is about Trump\u2019s corruption. That is what we should be focused on,\u201d Mr. Biden said at a Democratic primary debate at Otterbein University.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s lucrative business deals while his father was vice president has become a question dogging the elder Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d said Mr. Biden, referring to his son\u2019s TV interview earlier in the day. \u201cWhat I think is so important is that we speak of how important it is to remove this man from office.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden said he regretted causing headaches for his father\u2019s campaign, but that he did nothing unethical or illegal.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s $600,000-a-year job on the board of a Ukraine natural gas company is also at the center of the House Democrats impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump is accused of abusing his office when he asked Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Bidens.\n\nMr. Biden said the president was allowing foreign interference in U.S. politics, a concern he said dated back to George Washington.\n\nMr. Biden also said the Ukraine episode shows that Mr. Trump is afraid to face him in the general election.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate because he knows that if I get the nomination I will beat him like a drum,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
