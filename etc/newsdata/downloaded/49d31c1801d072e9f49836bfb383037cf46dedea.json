The biologist Erick Greene, at the University of Montana, told NPR in 2015 that not only do squirrels recognize the seet and mob calls of birds (the former warns others of a predator, the latter draws a mob of birds to chase a predator away), but they can also mimic them to near perfection.\n\nRead: When squirrels attack\n\n\u201cThose alarm calls become public information out there for the taking,\u201d says Tarvin. But with so much noise, he says responding to every warning sound\u2014even ones that turn out to be false alarms\u2014can become costly for the squirrels, as it cuts into time used to feed or reproduce. So he and his team wanted to know if squirrels also listen for cues that signal to them their surrounding is safe and predator-free. This is where the bird chatter comes in.\n\nTarvin and his team began their experiment by playing each squirrel in both the experimental and control groups recordings of hawks, which heightened their vigilance behavior\u2014things like freezing, looking up, and fleeing. After a few minutes, they played ambient noise for squirrels in the control group. The other group was played recordings of \u201cchatter\u201d from birds feeding in his backyard. They then observed each squirrel for three minutes, tracking how their vigilance levels changed over time.\n\n\u201cWe counted the number of times it would move its head really quick, [as if] scanning the environment,\u201d he says, \u201cor freeze, which turns out to be the most common response.\u201d Those in the group that was played bird chatter indeed froze and looked up less frequently, and were overall quicker to return to their normal state of vigilance. To Tarvin\u2019s team, that indicated that these safety cues can be just as important to squirrels as warning calls are, especially when it comes to survival.\n\nRead: The government\u2019s surprising history of squirrel population engineering\n\nThe field of information exploitation is relatively new and there are a lot of questions biologists like Tarvin want answered. For example, he wants to know if squirrels tune in to a specific kind of chatter, or if urban noise affects how prey animals rely on alarm calls from other species. He suspects it does: \u201cIf those information exploiters tend to rely on information producers, and you mask them [with noise],\u201d he said, \u201cthey may allocate more of their own time toward self-vigilance, which leaves less time to forage and mate.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as squirrels are eavesdropping on birds, Tarvin suggests city dwellers listen in on the furry rodents. \u201cNext time,\u201d he says, \u201cpay attention to the squirrels.\u201d\n\nThis post appears courtesy of CityLab .\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
