That alone makes it a worthy successor, especially since it sells for the same $50 price. It offers a richer sound that\u2019s immediately noticeable whether you\u2019re listening to music or podcasts, with some much-needed emphasis on the lows and mids. Granted, it\u2019s nowhere close to being a threat to more expensive options, like Apple\u2019s HomePod or a Sonos One, or even the medium-sized Google Home. But the gap in sound quality isn\u2019t as wide as it used to be. Plus, you can now easily mount the Nest Mini onto your wall.\n\nWhat about the third-generation Echo Dot, Amazon\u2019s low-cost smart speaker that also sounds impressive? It still has a few perks over the Nest Mini. There\u2019s the obvious one: it\u2019s the most affordable option for people who frequently use and rely on Amazon\u2019s services. If you\u2019re using the Echo Dot on a table, its side-firing speakers hit harder than the Nest Mini\u2019s upward-firing speaker. Both the Echo Dot and Nest Mini support Bluetooth pairing for your phone, tablet, or computer, and each can also connect to a larger Bluetooth speaker, if you want better sound. But, only the Echo Dot has a 3.5mm jack that allows for a wired connection.\n\nOur review of Google Nest Mini Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Sounds great when it\u2019s mounted to your wall\n\nThe backlit volume buttons are helpful Bad Stuff The sound isn\u2019t great unless you mount it to your wall\n\nIts new features don\u2019t warrant upgrading\n\nA 3.5mm jack would have been nice Buy for $49.00 from Google Store Buy for $49.00 from Walmart\n\nOne of the unique perks with the Nest Mini is its ability to hang on your wall without any additional accessories. This is where Google\u2019s speaker tips the scale in its favor. On the wall, the Nest Mini\u2019s sound fills much more space than the Echo Dot, and its improved mids and bass use the surface to resonate, giving it a deeper sound compared to when it\u2019s set flat. If you buy the Nest Mini, I highly suggest that you mount it.\n\nIn terms of sound quality, I prefer the Nest Mini\u2019s warm, gentle delivery, which only presents itself when it\u2019s hanging on the wall. When I listen to music, I\u2019m not usually listening to lyrics, but the instrumentation, and this is where Google\u2019s speaker leaps ahead of the Echo Dot. It separates low, medium, and high frequencies with much more grace, and overall, it provides the clarity I crave, whereas Amazon\u2019s speaker can sound condensed and a little muffled at times. The Echo Dot makes deep voices sound more powerful, though, so there\u2019s that if you listen to podcasts, or a lot of voice-driven tunes.\n\nThe Nest Mini still has the circular, fabric-covered design that made the Home Mini stand out. It comes in several colors: black, white, coral (sort of a mix of pink and orange), and sky (a new shade of blue that slightly differs from the Home Mini\u2019s mint color option). Google has sourced this fabric from recycled plastic bottles, which is very cool for a product that Google will probably move millions of, though it doesn\u2019t feel or look any different than before. It\u2019s worth noting that Google switched the power plug from Micro USB to a barrel plug, and it uses a bigger 15W plug, so your old wall socket mount that fit the Home Mini and its smaller plug won\u2019t be compatible with this new speaker.\n\nOne of this speaker\u2019s few new features is an ultrasonic sensor embedded underneath the fabric. It detects when you\u2019re near, then shows you where to tap to raise or lower the volume by lighting two LEDs, one on each side of the speaker. This is a low-stakes change that definitely should have been in the first-generation speaker, but it\u2019s nice to have now. Note that if you mount the Nest Mini to your wall, you\u2019ll need to change the orientation of these capacitive controls in the Google Home app.\n\nAlso, you can now tap the middle of the Nest Mini to play or pause your audio. If this sounds familiar, the Home Mini originally launched with this feature until Google stripped it out due to an error that made the Google Assistant continuously record. I\u2019m glad that Google figured this one out, too, but it doesn\u2019t really impact my usage much since I\u2019m usually controlling the speaker with my phone or with my voice. Speaking of voice, the physical microphone kill switch, an essential feature in any smart speaker or display, is still here.\n\nThe Nest Mini offers the same voice functionality as the Home Mini, and all of Google\u2019s other smart speakers. To wake it, you have to say \u201cHey Google\u201d or \u201cOK Google\u201d aloud, and the strip of LEDs in the middle of the Nest Mini indicates that you have its attention. Google added a third microphone to this device to hear you better, and in my studio apartment, it never failed to hear me calling out to it.\n\nThere are a few features that Google spoke of at its hardware event that aim to improve your experience with the device over time. The Nest Mini apparently works on an improved model of the Assistant, allowing it to eventually handle some of your frequently requested queries on-device instead of pinging servers. The goal of this is to speed up how fast the Nest Mini can execute commands. I couldn\u2019t perceive a difference during my time with it, but if it improves over time, that\u2019s nothing but a good thing.\n\nAGREE TO CONTINUE: GOOGLE NEST MINI Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. To use the Nest Mini, you\u2019ll need a Google account. If you don\u2019t have one of those, you\u2019ll need to agree to Google\u2019s terms of service and its privacy policy to create an account. For those logged into an Android phone, you definitely have an account, and have already agreed to these terms to use the phone. When you set up the Nest Mini, you\u2019re provided with an optional agreement on the page called \u201cHelp Improve Nest Mini.\u201d If you agree, you\u2019ll provide device- and crash-related info to Google. There\u2019s another optional agreement to accept only if you want Google to provide you personalized results based on your account. Final tally: two mandatory agreements, two optional agreements\n\nGoogle also claims that the Nest Mini can automatically tune itself to your environment, tweaking volume and other settings like the Apple HomePod and Google Home Max are able to do. Perhaps due to the small size of this speaker, and that it\u2019s nowhere near as powerful as the aforementioned devices, I couldn\u2019t tell when the Nest Mini ever made these smart adjustments, or if it ever did. I don\u2019t think Google is lying, but in my home, this new feature didn\u2019t make a difference to me.\n\nThe Google Nest Mini\u2019s sound impresses, and the few minor tweaks Google made to the interface are for the better. Beyond that, this speaker seems to mark a shift in Google\u2019s strategy. Instead of having a small, medium, and a large speaker available, each priced according to their size and capability, the new Nest Mini effectively is the new small and medium option. It doesn\u2019t sound quite as good as the medium-sized Google Home, but it\u2019s cheaper, easier to use, it can hang on your wall, and it sounds good enough that you\u2019ll actually want to use it to listen to music. It does just enough that\u2019s better and slightly different from Amazon\u2019s Echo Dot to make it worth the price. Though, if Google\u2019s strategy with the Home Mini taught us anything, it\u2019s that a deal or a giveaway offer is probably right around the corner, so you might want to wait a tic before dropping a Ulysses S.
