Tulsi Gabbard speaks at the first Democratic presidential debate in Miami, Fla., June 26, 2019. (Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nThe upcoming twelve-candidate Democratic presidential primary debate is probably going to be another mess, but one highlight will be the return of Tulsi Gabbard to the stage \u2014 good news not just for Michael Brendan Dougherty, but for everyone who wants to see an actual debate. In a series of prime-time meetings that have included a lot of repetitive platitudes and all-too-convenient anecdotes about an American everyman that candidates met on the trail, one of the few genuine bits of drama comes from the question of who Gabbard will go after and why.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hawaii congresswoman\u2019s debate performances haven\u2019t done much to break her out of the asterisk category, but boy, can she dissect an opponent\u2019s record in a devastating fashion. You could argue that Gabbard more than anyone else triggered the slide of Kamala Harris since the second debate.\n\nPeople forget that Gabbard pulled off a similarly effective attack against Tim Ryan in the first debate; Ryan was left insisting that even though he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be engaged\u201d in Afghanistan, as president he would keep U.S. troops in Afghanistan in an engagement he just said he didn\u2019t want. (Then again, people forget about Tim Ryan in general.)\n\nIn the first debate, she decried \u201ca government that is of, by, and for the rich and powerful,\u201d which would suggest that Hunter Biden\u2019s deals and business partners would be fertile territory. She recently said she hasn\u2019t seen much evidence that Elizabeth Warren is ready to be commander-in-chief. Or she may go after Harris again; she also recently scoffed at Harris\u2019 proposal to ban President Trump from Twitter. (You figure no one will be all that tough on the guy in third place who just had heart surgery.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet earlier this year, Gabbard declined to criticize Biden over his Iraq War vote (\u201cHe said he was wrong and he has apologized for it more than once. That\u2019s the kind of reflection that I think is important for any one of our politicians\u201d) and when Harris slammed Biden on bussing, Gabbard called it a \u201cfalse accusation that Joe Biden is a racist.\u201d\n\nDoes this sound like someone auditioning to be a running mate?", "description": "The upcoming Democratic presidential primary debate is probably going to be a mess, but one highlight will be the return of Tulsi Gabbard to the stage.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Andrew C.
