I respect the team because I watched them last year play.\n\n\u2018I know the team has changed slightly but I\u2019m very aware of the new threats that they have as a team.\n\n\u2018Anywhere in the Champions League to travel is a difficult match, they\u2019ve won two games convincingly in the Champions League.\n\n\u2018Definitely it\u2019s not a fact of being scared of Ajax \u2013 we hugely respect them as a team and we have confidence in ourselves. We know it\u2019s a tough match but we believe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And the reason why I spoke instantly after Newcastle is because Newcastle was a game in the Premier League where a team played very low block against us, 5-4-1, very difficult to break down which we managed to do.\n\n\u2018Ajax is completely different so it was really important that we flipped a switch the minute Newcastle finished to concentrate on what\u2019s a tough match tomorrow.\u2019\n\nLampard confirmed that Callum Hudson-Odoi could be in line to make his full Champions League debut on Wednesday evening.\n\nAsked whether Hudson-Odoi is ready to start, Lampard replied: \u2018I think he is.\n\n\u2018So are some other players and there comes my problem but it\u2019s a competitive squad.\n\n\u2018Just talking about Callum, his performance was huge [against Newcastle]. We know his talent. The problems he gave Newcastle was what I want to see consistently from him.\n\n\u2018He certainly is ready, there\u2019s no guarantees [with young players] but he is.\u2019\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi looks set to make his full Champions League debut (Picture: Getty)\n\nN\u2019Golo Kante and Ross Barkley will both miss the tie and are also doubts for this weekend\u2019s trip to Burnley.\n\nAsked for updates on Kante, Barkley and Antonio Rudiger, Lampard revealed: \u2018Obviously they are all not here.\n\n\u2018Ross will hopefully be fit to train on Thursday. Rudiger has trained today, but it was only a small programme. He\u2019s out of contention for this weekend but will hopefully be back soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018N\u2019Golo is training again but it\u2019s not clear whether he will be fit for the weekend or not.\u2019\n\nMORE: Paul Gascoigne tears up while recalling sexual assault allegation: \u2018Turning to alcohol would have been easy\u2019", "description": "After a rocky start at Chelsea, Frank Lampard is proving himself to be a shrewd operator in top level management and the consummate professional we all knew him to be...", "authors": ["Tom Olver"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lampard-9c32_1571816601.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
