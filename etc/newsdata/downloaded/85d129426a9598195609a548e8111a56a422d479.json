Calhoun, to serve as non-executive chairman.\n\nEarlier on Friday, a panel of international aviation regulators issued a report critical of Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration over how the Max was approved to fly. The group said Boeing failed to adequately inform the FAA about changes to a key flight-control system implicated in the accidents.\n\nMuilenburg said in a statement that he supported splitting the CEO and chairman jobs.\n\n\"The board has full confidence in Dennis as CEO and believes this division of labor will enable maximum focus on running the business with the board playing an active oversight role,\" Calhoun said in a statement issued by the company.\n\nThe board in April opposed a shareholder resolution to split the jobs amid criticism over Boeing's response to the accidents. The measure was rejected by a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nFILE - In this Monday, April 29, 2019 file photo, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg speaks during a news conference after the company's annual shareholders meeting at the Field Museum in Chicago.

The company has set aside billions compensate airlines affected by the grounding.\n\nThe Justice Department and Congress are investigating the company, which also faces dozens of lawsuits by families of passengers who died in the crashes.\n\nMuilenburg is scheduled to testify Oct. 30 before a House committee looking into the plane's certification.\n\nBoeing was initially optimistic that the Max could return to flight this spring, but work to fix flight software took longer than expected. In June, FAA test pilots discovered another problem in the plane's computers, extending the grounding.\n\nMuilenburg said recently that Boeing expected the plane to be back in service by early in the fourth quarter, but the company still hasn't formally submitted its fixes to regulators. U.S. airlines don't expect the plane back until at least January, and it could be longer in other countries.\n\nChicago-based Boeing is one of two companies that dominate the building of large airliners; Europe's Airbus is the other. Boeing is also a major defense contractor. It has more than 150,000 employees.", "description": "CHICAGO (AP) - Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has lost his title as chairman of the troubled aircraft manufacturer, nearly a year after the first of two...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/01/wire-19613024-1570839762-621_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
