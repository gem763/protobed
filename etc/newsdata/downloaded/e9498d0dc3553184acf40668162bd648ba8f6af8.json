You\u2019ve asked a great question \u2014 who is Ninja, really? \u2014 and I\u2019m here to explain in a blog post, because that\u2019s how the content sausage gets made, baby. (I am not being forced to do this, but I am getting paid to, and, honestly, isn\u2019t that just about the same thing?)\n\nIn any case: your question. Ninja is a guy who was born in Detroit, MI, with the name Richard Tyler Blevins. Now he\u2019s a 28-year-old who lives somewhere else, presumably, who streams himself playing video games live on a website no one really watches yet, called Mixer \u2014 to an audience of tens of thousands of people who adore him for his gameplay and his ~crackling~ wit.\n\n. @Ninja who are you \u2014 Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) October 16, 2019\n\nBasically, this guy\u2019s a big deal online. It\u2019s cool if you\u2019re not really online. You\u2019re kinda too rich for it, imo. (If I were rich, I certainly would not be.)\n\nAnyway. Ninja is probably the most famous gamer on the planet. And he\u2019s famous for playing Fortnite \u2014 I know you asked about that the other day; isn\u2019t it amazing that you\u2019re getting two unsolicited answers for the price of one? \u2014 which is a game for children that many, many adults love. It\u2019s colorful! It\u2019s got llama pi\u00f1atas! And you can make a ton of money playing it in front of an audience!\n\nIf you don\u2019t know about him, that\u2019s probably because you\u2019re one of the most famous musicians on the planet, and those spheres don\u2019t really intersect. (At least not yet. I assume they\u2019ll get there eventually.) Basically: you\u2019re both multimillionaires from the things you seem to enjoy doing \u2014 do you like to sing? Or are you more into acting these days? \u2014 and you should know each other. The fact that you\u2019re even interacting on Twitter has people in a tizzy, like the pro gamer dudes at TSM:\n\nWe live in a simulation and I'm completely fine with it. https://t.co/SUQjBJ8Add \u2014 Myth (@TSM_Myth) October 16, 2019\n\nThey\u2019re so riled up they believe Elon Musk! I\u2019ve never been that worked up in my life. (These guys also play games for a living. If you\u2019re in touch with Cardi B, please ask her what Offset does with FaZe \u2014 she\u2019ll know what you\u2019re talking about.) Hope this helps!\n\nCordially yours,\n\nBijan\n\nP.S. You said you were never coming back in that video you did with Beyonc\u00e9. What\u2019s up with that?", "description": "Lady Gaga, since you asked: Ninja is a guy who was born in Detroit, MI, with the name Tyler Blevins.
