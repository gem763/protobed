We all know he\u2019s not a goalscoring machine or that goal-scoring comes naturally to him.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got other attributes to his game that are phenomenal that we see him produce for England on a regular basis.\n\n\u2018He gets all this criticism thrown at him yet you\u2019ve got players like Martial who just goes missing. You talk injuries but it happens every single season at United.\n\n\u2018Why get rid of Lukaku when you\u2019ve got someone like Martial who is doing that every week.\n\n\u2018Just because he\u2019s a younger player, or he\u2019s more valuable? I\u2019m questioning so many decisions that are being made.\u2019", "description": "Jermaine Jenas has questioned why Manchester United sold Romelu Lukaku rather than Anthony Martial in the summer.
