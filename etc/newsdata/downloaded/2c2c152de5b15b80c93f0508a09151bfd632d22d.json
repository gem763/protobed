This has got to change.\n\n'GPs do an extremely difficult job often under inadequate time restraints.\n\n'But with GPs often the first port of call for mental health support, it's crucial they have the opportunity to get the training they need to support patients to have the information to make decisions about their treatment.\n\n'Medication can be effective in managing symptoms of mental health problems, but not for everyone.\n\n'It is critical people are told about potential adverse side effects, such as suicidal thoughts and self-harm, so they can make informed choices.'\n\nPeople in Britain use more antidepressants than almost every other country in the Western world, which experts believe is partly due to lack of awareness of withdrawal problems.\n\nThe worst-hit experience nausea, anxiety, insomnia and agitation - with many people put back on antidepressants because doctors mistake the symptoms for a relapse of depression itself.\n\nA league table of antidepressants published in 2017 put the UK at fourth of the 29 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, up from seventh in the year 2000.\n\nDr Sebastion Pillon, a GP from Bolton, said: 'As there's more acceptance and understanding about mental health, GPs are going to see more and more patients with these kind of issues.\n\n'I think additional training would help make sure all newly qualified GPs are confident in supporting people with problems like depression and anxiety, as well as related problems like alcohol and substance misuse, and chronic conditions like diabetes and lung disease, which often go hand-in-hand with poor mental health.'\n\nProfessor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: 'GPs are specialist prescribers and will only recommend medications based on the individual circumstances of a patient, taking into account physical, psychological and social factors, and after a full and frank discussion around treatment options.\n\n'General practice is under extreme pressures and the standard 10-minute GP consultation is simply inadequate to properly deliver care to patients with complex health needs - which mental health conditions invariably are.\n\n'We need greater investment in general practice so that we can spend more time with our patients.'", "description": "The charity Mind asked 12,000 mental health patients in the UK about their experience with antidepressants.
