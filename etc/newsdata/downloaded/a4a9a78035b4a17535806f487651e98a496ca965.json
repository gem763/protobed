But the problems have returned this month, with rubbish lying uncollected in the city centre and beyond, and they are likely to persist as a three-month contract under which Rome\u2019s waste was sent to disposal plants across the Lazio region will soon expire.\n\nRome\u2019s mayor, Virginia Raggi, is often criticised for the city\u2019s poor public services, including waste collection, public transport or streets with potholes and protruding cobbles.\n\nRaggi said in mid-September she had witnessed an \u201cunacceptable\u201d drop in rubbish collection, blaming waste facilities in Lazio for not maintaining the deal struck in July, with one of the reasons being lack of storage space.\n\nRome only has one waste processing plant, Rocca Cencia, where the conveyor belt broke down earlier this month due to being overloaded. In January, Raggi sacked the entire board of Ama, the waste collection company that has long been blighted by inefficiency and corruption issues.\n\nThe extent of the rubbish problem is continuously chronicled on social media, with Rome residents sharing images of overflowing bins and, on some occasions, wild boar rummaging through piles of waste in the outskirts of the city.", "description": "Italian capital\u2019s waste management problems compounded by inefficiency and corruption", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida", "Tobias Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c9ec06b56417fe6555863fb922f1abb9233867c/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4eb41371c2f0683d962d103fb9147d8e", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
