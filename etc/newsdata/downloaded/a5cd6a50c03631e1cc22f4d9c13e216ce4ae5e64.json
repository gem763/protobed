Giuffre alleges she was trafficked internationally to have sex with prominent American politicians, business executives and world leaders, some of whom she named in a deposition.\n\nGiuffre sued in 2015, alleging Maxwell subjected her to \u201cpublic ridicule, contempt and disgrace\u201d by calling her a liar in published statements \u201cwith the malicious intent of discrediting and further damaging Giuffre worldwide.\u201d\n\nAbout one-fifth of all documents filed in the case were done so under seal, a level of secrecy the 2nd Circuit ruled was unjustified. The appellate court, in unsealing the records, issued an unusual warning to the public and the media \u201cto exercise restraint\u201d regarding potentially defamatory allegations contained in the depositions and other court filings.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sealed court records contain the names of at least hundreds of third parties who were mentioned in a civil case involving sexual abuse allegations against the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, a federal judge said Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Mustian"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/jeffrey_epstein_31369_c0-237-2000-1403_s1770x1032.jpg?756f43fdf565e95cf4789b0ad5608543c0f11fba"}
