After he quit the KMT last week, he had come under pressure from opposition leaders, including former President Ma Ying-jeou, to drop out of the race and support their nominee to help return the China-friendly party to power.\n\n\u201cWith this poor election climate and prevailing populism, I\u2019m not willing to participate in this political farce, not only for my own personal and factional interests, but also because class struggle is tearing Taiwan apart,\u201d Gou said in a video released Tuesday.\n\nGou could still run as a candidate for one of Taiwan\u2019s established political parties.\n\nShares in companies controlled by Gou slumped Tuesday. FIH Mobile Ltd. was the worst performer on Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Composite Index, tumbling as much as 23.2%. His flagship Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. fell 2% in Taipei.\n\nGou had been widely expected to run for the presidency after publicly flirting with the idea since losing the KMT primary to Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu in July. Gou\u2019s candidacy threatened to sap support for Han who will challenge President Tsai Ing-wen in the Jan. 11 election.\n\nGou trailed the two candidates from the main parties by at least seven percentage points, according to a survey released by TVBS last week. In a two-way race, Tsai leads with 49% of support, compared with 42% for Han.\n\nWhat had been shaping up as Taiwan\u2019s most competitive presidential election in decades could end up being essentially a straight fight between Tsai and Han. Another prospective independent candidate, Taipei City Mayor Ko Wen-je, said he had no intention of running for president, according to a report by TV news channel TVBS on Tuesday.\n\nStill, Tsai could face increased competition for voters who favor a stronger push for the island\u2019s formal independence. Former Vice President Annette Lu announced her intention to run as an independent. Lu served as vice president under Chen Shui-bian between 2000 and 2008.\n\n(An earlier version of this story was corrected to fix spelling of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. in fifth paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Tony Jordan.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Ten Kate at dtenkate@bloomberg.net, Samson Ellis, Karen Leigh\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Foxconn Technology Group, pulled out of next year\u2019s presidential election in Taiwan, a move that may help unite the opposition Kuomintang party.Gou apologized to his supporters in a statement on Facebook Tuesday outlining his decision to withdraw from", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6Bq8zEOMT713ipiM3g26_A--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/8e8eaa93d2147c164e85321bb6c0cb03", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
