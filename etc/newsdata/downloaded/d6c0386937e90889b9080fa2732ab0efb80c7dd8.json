Not for the first time, Scotland get the drive going and the Russian bodies are left in its wake, power and more power as it goes on, and George Turner pivoting out of it to scamper over with the Russian defence nowhere. Adam Hastings makes it five from five from the tee. Scotland 35-0 Russia 49 minutes Scotland back into their attacking work inside the Russian 22. Adam Hastings flings a risky pass into John Barclay's great paws as the Russian defence sniffs the intercept, and Scotland are within ten metres. Not quite! Blair Kinghorn gets to the corner of the Russian defence and should probably just round it and continue thumping his lengthy legs towards the line, but instead tries to tee up Tommy Seymour with an offload out the back door, but it fails to find his hands and sails into touch. SUBS 47 minutes That's Graham's last action of the game - Henry Pyrgos replaces him, with George Horne moving to the wing and Pyrgos in at nine. Just the 151 run metres in less than 50 minutes for Graham. Pocket rocket. TRY! TRY! OH MY DARCY GRAHAM! George Horne is in for his second! Pure pace. That is obscene running from Darcy Graham, spotting an unstructured kick chase and knifing through a huge gap. And onwards he goes, weaving between would-be tacklers, from his own 22 untouched all the way into the Russians', subtle adjustments of his running line to completely tear the defence apart, a right-foot step to beat one man and plenty more gas to go. He could probably put his toe down and canter over himself for one of the great individual World Cup tries but flips the ball for Horne for the try and the bonus point. Brilliant stuff. Scotland 28-0 Russia Advertisement 44 minutes Scotland have tried to get Graham's hands on the ball whenever possible today, but he has been largely well-handled, and Scott Cummings knocks on from the next phase as Graham is tackled. 43 minutes Scotland get a little bit of a rumble on at maul time and George Horne has plenty of time to box kick from the back of it as a result, allowing Darcy Graham to get his hands on his well-placed high launch, but the wing is driven over the touchline. Russia make a mess of the lineout, though, and Scotland will have the scrum on the left just inside their own half. 42 minutes Scotland's restart fails to go ten metres, and Russia's scrum is good on halfway, allowing Ramil Gaisin to guide a lovely kick beyond Adam Hastings and in to the 22 of Scotland. SUBS 41 minutes A half-time change for Scotland - Simon Berghan, named as replacement loosehead but a tighthead by trade, is on for Zander Fagerson at his favoured position on the right of the front row. Vladimir Ostroushko is back with us after his HIA. Advertisement KICK OFF Resumption in Shizuoka This is exactly the sort of game that suits Hastings, with plenty of turnover, broken-field ball for him to play from and Russia leaving so much space in the backfield into which the ten has been able to put kicks. Scotland have had forward ascendancy, too - that's rather rare with this current iteration of the side. Still, Hastings has really taken his chance. He really kicked on at Glasgow last season after Finn Russell headed for Racing 92 in France, but was heavily criticised for a performance against France in the warm-ups. It's good to see such a talented young player bounce back. Job almost done for Scotland, who have had a very strong half. Attacking, intelligent rugby throughout the first 40 minutes, letting Russia have little of the ball in good areas, pushing them back with tactical kicking and creatively dismantling a poorly organised defence when chances came. Adam Hastings has been simply magnificent at ten, scoring the first two tries, and George Horne's interception at the tail of a lineout leaves them on the cusp of the bonus point win they need to realistically keep their World Cup quarter-final hopes alive. HALF TIME HALF TIME: Scotland 21-0 Russia Advertisement 41 minutes But George Horne loses the ball as he looks to snipe, and Russia survive. 40 minutes On they play, with lovely sleight of hand from Adam Hastings to pop the ball to Duncan Taylor when the pass seemed set for the player looping behind the outside centre. Taylor to pithing four metres, and Scotland begin to pick and drive. 39 minutes Scotland win the ball back with strong maul defence, and will get a final chance to assemble a go at the line as the half's close draws near. SUBS 37 minutes Yury Kushnarev is on the field for Vladimir Outstroushko, who might have a head knock. Two fly-halves on the pitch now for Russia. But it is Scotland's fly-half who is starring. Adam Hastings' attacking kicking game is so good, and another chip hops back into his hands as he makes ground down the left. He's biffed into touch as he tries to toe ahead another kick for Darcy Graham. Advertisement 36 minutes I think Scotland have got a bit carried away with this fine start. Blair Kinghorn's counter is a good one and he is beyond the Russian defence, but it is all too fast and furious around the fringes, too cavalier the offload from Adam Hastings, and there's an accidental offside to end the movement. 34 minutes The lineout is inside the Russian 22 but Scotland fail to capitalise on the attacking position, losing flow in the midfield and allowing Russia to turn the ball over. The Bears will have the scrum feed. \u200bPlucked! 32 minutes Scotland are beginning to find their attacking game. Zander Fagerson puts a hand right in the face of a smaller Russian defender and puts a mask on him, driving him back with a huge fend and powering ten metres beyond the mainline. George Horne prods a box kick over the top, and Scotland will have the lineout after Russia clear.
