Golfers drive around the courses in golf carts. They pay their annual dues\u2014often multiple thousands of dollars\u2014to golf clubs, which foster an aristocratic playing experience, lending the sport its presidential connotation. Across the United States, golf is widely considered a rich man\u2019s sport.\n\nNot so with rez golf. The term refers to courses developed on Native American reservations, which often incorporate rugged terrain into their design and employ an open-door policy to anyone who wants to try the sport. The short documentary Rez Golf, directed by Charles Frank and produced by VICE and the KIMBA Group for Callaway, takes us deep into the heart of the Navajo Nation to meet the founders of Wagon Trail to Lonesome Pine, a par-five rez-golf course and the first of its kind.\n\n\u201cWhat was most compelling about the golf course is really the fact that it shouldn't exist,\u201d the film\u2019s producer, Mark Infante, told me. \u201cThe reservation does not have the resources to upkeep a golf course, like commercial machinery, irrigation systems, or a lot of manpower. Its founders maintain the course themselves with the tools that they have and spend hours upon hours keeping the course in playing shape for others.\u201d\n\nThe course\u2019s founders built Lonesome Pine on a volunteer basis, spending their nights and weekends clearing the land by hand. The lack of recreational facilities on the reservation\u2014especially for children\u2014inspired the project, but its popularity within the community at large has given it staying power.\n\n\u201cWater is scarce in the area, so maintaining grass is not an option,\u201d Infante said. \u201cInstead, [rez golfers] play in the dirt. Not only is it more challenging for the players, but with the high winds in the area, the greens\u2014or browns, as they call them\u2014are constantly eroding.\u201d Although the founders have invented methods of compacting the dirt so that it's smooth enough to putt on but soft enough for the ball to land, they are constantly tasked with repacking the dirt, which inevitably dries up and blows away thanks to harsh conditions in the region.\n\nIn addition to the value it adds to the Navajo community, Rez golf\u2019s emphasis on openness has challenged golf\u2019s elitist reputation. \u201cThere's a lot of antiquated etiquette surrounding the game,\u201d Frank told me. \u201cOftentimes there are pricey barriers to entry, like greens fees, proper attire, clubs, and balls. At Wagon Trail to Lonesome Pine, there are no barriers to entry. As long as you clean up after yourself, it's free to play.\u201d", "description": "A rez golf course challenges the sport\u2019s elitist reputation.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/10/Rez_Golf_Site/video-featured.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
