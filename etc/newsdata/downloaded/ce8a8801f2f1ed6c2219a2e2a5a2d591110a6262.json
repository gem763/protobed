Gavin Newsome, who said \u201cthis is not \u2014 from my perspective \u2014 a climate change story, as much as a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades.\u201d\n\nIn response to this, Jagdfeld said climate change has actually been a large factor in his company\u2019s growth and stock rise.\n\n\u201cWe've grown 10 percent a year for the last decade ... Really, because of the severity of weather,\u201d he told Claman. \u201cThe severity and the frequency of storms has increased. And as that happens, you're more susceptible to experience a power outage. And as people go through those outages, they turn to a product like ours to help them work through it.\u201d\n\nJagdfeld also spoke on the future of the energy industry and said he sees major changes coming in the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cWe believe that traditional utility model \u2014 this idea of power being generated in a central plant by coal or nuclear power and being transmitted hundreds or thousands of miles across wires to your meter, your home, or your business's electrical meter ... That arrangement is gonna change,\u201d he said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nEarlier in 2019, Jagdfeld\u2019s company acquired Pika Energy, Inc., which works to capture and store solar energy and grid power, which could lead to each individual home generating its own electricity.\n\n\u201cWhether that's solar or wind, they're going to store that power,\" Jagdfeld said. \"They're going to consume that power when they need it, and they're going to have a choice and a say and more flexibility in what they pay for that power.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Not everyone is CA is seeing a downside of the PG&E power outages.", "authors": ["Catie Perry"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Untitled-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
