REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nThe country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves - the world\u2019s largest - rose by $3.5 billion in August to $3.1072 trillion, central bank data showed on Saturday.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected reserves would fall $4 billion from July to $3.100 trillion, likely due to fluctuations in global exchange rates and the prices of foreign bonds that China holds.\n\nThe increase in August was due to China maintaining a stable balance of international payments and generally stable economic growth, the foreign exchange regulator said in a statement after the data release.\n\nBond prices in major countries also rose, it added.\n\nChina has been able to keep capital outflows under control over the past year despite an escalating trade war with the United States and weakening economic growth at home.\n\nReserves have rebounded from an October 2018 low thanks to capital controls and rising foreign investments in Chinese stocks and bonds.\n\nIn August, the yuan CNY=CFXS tumbled about 3.8% against the dollar \u2013 its sharpest monthly drop since China unified official and market exchange rates in 1994.
