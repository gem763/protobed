The settlement brings to a close the company\u2019s case with the SEC, Matthew Seinsheimer, a spokesman for TechnipFMC, said. He added that the company first disclosed its agreement with the securities regulator in June. The required $5.1 million payment is the amount the company gained from operating the scheme, according to the SEC. The SEC agreement comes three months after the company said in a separate agreement it would pay about $300 million to settle joint bribery probes from prosecutors in the U.S. and Brazil. The company and its subsidiary, Technip USA Inc., agreed at the time to plead guilty to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The company also said in June that it was cooperating with an investigation by French prosecutors into the company\u2019s work in Equatorial Guinea and Ghana. The SEC settlement focuses on FMC\u2019s previous work in Iraq. The company overlooked \u201cnumerous red flags\u201d in making payments to a consultant without evidence of services rendered, the SEC said in the filing. It also didn\u2019t put in place adequate internal accounting controls to spot illicit payments to foreign officials, according to the securities regulator. Under the agreement, TechnipFMC will provide the SEC with periodic updates over a three-year review period on its efforts to improve due diligence on third-party vendors, as well as on its work to strengthen compliance with foreign bribery laws, according to the filing.
