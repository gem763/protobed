Are they displaying their wonderful imaginations? Or is it ... more?\n\nEither way, their stories are fascinating, which is probably why a tweet that started as a simple, \u201cMy kid just said the weirdest thing\u201d story quickly turned into a thread of parents sharing their kids\u2019 ghost sightings and reincarnation tales.\n\nSON: Cole was so sad we died cuz he really loved our momma but I wasn\u2019t too sad cuz I picked you to be my new momma ME: pic.twitter.com/CWCxr5XDGr \u2014 Valerie (@ValeeGrrl) December 28, 2018\n\nOther Twitter users chimed in with their own creepy stories, including:\n\nA 4-year-old who told his mum that he used to sell newspapers in front of the Capitol Building to save up money for glasses.\n\nA little girl who recognised her father\u2019s new office building as her old school from the 1890s.\n\nCountless kids who reported conversations with grandparents and great-grandparents they\u2019ve never met.\n\nBuzzFeed curated 19 of the creepiest (or most awesome, depending on your perspective) stories from the thread, which are worth a read.\n\nBut we can\u2019t get enough of them, so we want to hear your kid ghost/reincarnation stories.
