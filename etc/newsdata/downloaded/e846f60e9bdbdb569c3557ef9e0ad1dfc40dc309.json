They have also suggested she should lose a chunk of her planned portfolio.\n\nAny failure to confirm Goulard, an ex-MEP supported by the liberal-centrist Renew Europe group, would be a blow to Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen, particularly as the Parliament has already rejected two of her nominees over ethical concerns. It would also embarrass French President Emmanuel Macron, who is close to Goulard and secured an influential portfolio for her. Even removing some of Goulard's planned responsibilities would be a defeat for von der Leyen and Macron.\n\nMembers of the EPP have criticized Goulard's performance at her tense first hearing last week, and some want more reassurances that she would step down from the Commission if she is formally charged in a legal probe into her use of parliamentary assistants.\n\nOther political groups are holding off on deciding whether Goulard should face another hearing until they see her answers to written questions, submitted by MEPs after her first grilling. But the EPP argues only the timing of a second hearing should be open to debate.\n\n\u201cI am fairly impressed about the plundering success of the Elys\u00e9e, which managed to get three directorate generals\u201d \u2014 Christian Ehler, the EPP coordinator for the Industrial and Research Committee\n\n\u201cThe second hearing is going to come anyway,\u201d said Christian Ehler, the EPP coordinator for the Industrial and Research Committee, one of two panels in the Parliament overseeing Goulard's confirmation process. \u201cIt only depends when the written answers come.\u201d\n\nIf a second hearing is requested, it could take place on Thursday morning, Parliament officials said.\n\nGoulard has until Tuesday at noon to respond to MEPs' concerns. Her answers will be examined by the coordinators of the Industry and Research and Internal Market committees, who would need to vote by a two-thirds majority to request an additional hearing. That request would then go to Parliament's Conference of Presidents, a committee of senior MEPs.\n\nSo far, the far-right Identity and Democracy group as well as the far-left GUE are likely to support the EPP in making such a request, regardless of Goulard's written answers.\n\nMembers of the EPP say they are not convinced Goulard could manage a wide-ranging portfolio that would include items as diverse as the defense industry, space and audiovisual policies.\n\nBut some of their objections relate to the idea that France, and Macron specifically, has been given too much power and influence through Goulard's planned portfolio.\n\n\u201cI am fairly impressed about the plundering success of the Elys\u00e9e, which managed to get three directorate generals,\u201d Ehler said.\n\nSuch comments will fuel suspicion among their political opponents that the campaign against Goulard is an attempt to exact revenge on Macron, who blocked EPP group leader Manfred Weber's campaign to become European Commission president.\n\nThose suspicions will only be bolstered by demands from EPP members that the audiovisual sector should go to incoming Innovation and Youth Commissioner Mariya Gabriel \u2014 another EPP politician.\n\nSabine Verheyen, a German member of the EPP and the Parliament\u2019s culture committee chair, expressed doubts during Goulard's initial hearing that the French nominee would have time to deal with audiovisual policy given her broad portfolio.\n\nGabriel, as the current commissioner for digital, would be well-placed to deal with the audiovisual sector because she already knows the files, said Michaela \u0160ojdrov\u00e1, the EPP coordinator for the Parliament\u2019s culture committee.\n\nLast week, Goulard insisted she was \u201cclean\u201d and called on MEPs to respect her \u201cpresumption of innocence.\"\n\n\"In 2014, it was decided to move audiovisual policy from the [Hungarian] Commissioner Tibor Navracsics for political reasons. Now it is not needed anymore,\" she said.\n\nHowever, switching audiovisual policy to Gabriel is also backed by the center-left Socialists & Democrats (S&D).\n\nThat support is partly because members of the Parliament\u2019s culture committee \u2014 already disappointed that the world \u201cculture\u201d is absent from Gabriel\u2019s portfolio \u2014 are eager to oversee a commissioner with responsibility for audiovisual policy, one of the few areas in which they have responsibility for legislating.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong consensus that the audiovisual and media sector ... must be given to Mariya Gabriel to ensure that it is given the full attention it needs as part of a culture-focussed brief,\u201d said Julie Ward, a vice chair of the culture committee who belongs to the S&D.\n\nBut French officials have made clear any change to the portfolio would be unacceptable.\n\n\u201cTouching the portfolio is out of the question because it wouldn\u2019t be a move against Goulard, but a move against France,\u201d said one French diplomatic official.\n\nA Renew Europe official said they were \"extremely surprised\" that changing Goulard's portfolio had emerged as a proposed solution to her confirmation problems. \u201cThat is a recognition that there are no fundamental problems with Sylvie Goulard\u2019s profile,\u201d the official said.\n\nLast week, Goulard insisted she was \u201cclean\u201d and called on MEPs to respect her \u201cpresumption of innocence.\"\n\nMembers of the S&D and the Greens said they would wait for Goulard\u2019s written answers and suggested she could avoid a second hearing if they were satisfactory.\n\n\u201cWe want to have her response be a little bit clearer on her personal integrity,\u201d said Christel Schaldemose, the S&D coordinator for the Internal Market Committee. \u201cI have no intention to ask for a second hearing if her answers are satisfactory.\u201d\n\n\"It is important to make sure she answers more specifically, more concretely, maybe with promises to step down if anything goes further in the investigation,\" Schaldemose said.\n\nMarcel Kolaja, a Parliament vice president and the Green coordinator of the Internal Market Committee, took a similar stance. \u201cEverything boils down to more concrete answers on policy and on integrity,\u201d Kolaja said.\n\nRym Momtaz in Paris contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
