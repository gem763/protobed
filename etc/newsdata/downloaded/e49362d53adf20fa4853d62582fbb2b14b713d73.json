REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Ryanair (RYA.I) will wait until the next turn of the cycle before it can place an order for more Boeing (BA.N) or Airbus (AIR.PA) jets at cheaper prices, Chief Executive Michael O\u2019Leary said on Tuesday.\n\nRyanair is one of the biggest customers of Boeing\u2019s grounded 737 MAX aircraft, with 135 firm aircraft orders and 75 options, and O\u2019Leary said the company\u2019s shift to a group structure could see the company take on Airbus jets into its fleet in the medium term.\n\n\u201cThere will be opportunities there, but at the moment there are no pricing opportunities on aircraft. The MAX has been grounded, Airbus are pricing up, Boeing are pricing up because they\u2019ve nothing to sell,\u201d O\u2019Leary said at a Reuters Newsmaker event in London.\n\n\u201cI think we have to wait for the next turn in the cycle.\u201d", "description": "Ryanair will wait until the next turn of the cycle before it can place an order for more Boeing or Airbus jets at cheaper prices, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435824809&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902DJ", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
