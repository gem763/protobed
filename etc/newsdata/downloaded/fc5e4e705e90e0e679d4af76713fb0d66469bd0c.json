They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports.... And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!\u201d Trump tweeted about half an hour after the ECB\u2019s policy announcement.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s aggressive move, which included a renewal of $20 billion euros in monthly bond-buying that will continue indefinitely, will add further pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates when it meets next week.\n\nThough a rate cut of a quarter of a percentage point was widely expected before the ECB meeting, the extent of the move in Frankfurt makes the case more compelling, adding downward pressure on U.S. inflation and feeding through to exchange rates that influence the price of U.S. exports \u2014 the issue highlighted by Trump.\n\nThe reaction in markets, however, showed the difficulty of predicting what the ECB\u2019s new program will mean, particularly with the U.S. and China engaged in an unpredictable trade debate that could shape how the world economy performs.\n\nFollowing the ECB announcement the euro\u2019s value against the dollar first dipped sharply to its lowest level in more than two years, before recovering all of that lost ground as investors questioned how long the central bank\u2019s new bond-buying may go on. U.S. bond yields showed a similar pattern, first falling but then rising back to where they started amid news of possible progress on the trade discussion.\n\nU.S. stock markets opened slightly higher.\n\nStill, the euro has weakened by more than 4.6% versus the greenback this year, and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business Network in an interview that the expected quarter of a percentage point interest rate cut by the Fed next week was \u201cnot enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at what the Europeans just did. You\u2019ve got to match that and raise it,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cThe market just went up on ECB news, rallied strongly on ECB news. The question is: what did the fed funds futures do. Did the probability of 50 basis points go up?\u201d Navarro said, referring to the size of a possible Fed rate cut.\n\nIt did not.\n\nInvestors in interest rate futures contracts tied to the Fed\u2019s target policy rate have priced in a quarter of a point cut at a near 90 percent probability, with a similar reduction expected to follow in October.\n\nThe world\u2019s major central banks, as well as monetary officials in China, are now in a global round of policy easing that has taken on an air of competition as elected officials battle over how to rewrite the rules for international trade.\n\nTrump, as he spars with China, has in recent months called on the Fed to restart its own \u201cquantitative easing\u201d program of bond purchases begun in the wake of the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis and recession. With the U.S. economy likely slowing as his re-election campaign looms next year, Trump on Wednesday said the U.S. central bank should follow Europe and drive rates below zero - the justification for his comment that \u201cthey get paid to borrow money.\u201d\n\nThe ECB on Thursday cut it main policy rate from -0.4 percent to -0.5 percent. That setting, along with weak economic fundamentals, has led some European countries, most notably Germany, to be able to sell government bonds at negative rates, in effect taxing those who own them rather than paying a return.\n\nFed officials are skeptical that negative rates work well, and are concerned in particular about the impact they would have if applied to the world\u2019s dominant currency. They also have seen no reason to begin asset purchases with the economy still growing and unemployment at a record low.", "description": "The European Central Bank's move to cut interest rates and restart a larger stimulus program drew fast reaction from the White House on Thursday, with President Donald Trump saying the ECB was undercutting the value of its currency and \"hurting U.S. exports.\"", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
