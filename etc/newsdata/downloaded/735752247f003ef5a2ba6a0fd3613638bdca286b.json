Alongside all the usual Christmassy joy Lush brings this time of year, the brand is also launching three Christmas concept stores in Liverpool, Birmingham, and on London\u2019s Oxford Street.\n\nInside those concept stores will be big conveyor belts packed with limited edition festive treats, all free of plastic packaging.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been to Yo! Sushi, you\u2019ll know the drill. Picture one of those moving arrays with bath bombs instead of salmon rolls and you\u2019ll get it. You\u2019ll also want to climb aboard, because that\u2019s how everyone feels when presented with a conveyor belt, and have one of your own in a dream bathroom, so you can select the perfect bathing product for each session in the tub.\n\nLike Yo! Sushi, but with bath bombs (Picture: Lush)\n\nAlongside being a massive gimmick, the conveyor belts are serving a purpose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of the products on the belts don\u2019t have any packaging, so if you pick one up you\u2019ll need to skip the plastic and opt to have the item wrapped in a Lush Knot Wrap \u2013 a reusable alternative to traditional wrapping paper that\u2019s made from organic cotton or recycled bottles.\n\nPlus, it looks cool, and we reckon you could kill a few hours just watching the sparkly products move by.\n\nThe biggest conveyor belt is 14 metres long and has 106 Christmas bath products on revolve, so you\u2019ll have loads to choose from.\n\nEnjoy getting hooked and buying far more bath bombs than you planned.\n\nMORE: There\u2019s a clitoral \u2018ghosting balm\u2019 to help you get over your MIA lovers\n\nMORE: The top trending Halloween costumes for 2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Lush is introducing Christmas product conveyor belts in London, Liverpool, and Birmingham.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lush-Conveyor-Belt-413f_1572093924.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
