I mean that was a totally dreamed up story, the best I can tell,\u201d Perry told a news conference in Vilnius on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe gave recommendations at the request of the Ukrainian government, and we will continue to,\u201d he added.\n\nNews website Axios has reported that Trump told House Republicans he did not want to make the July 25 call to Zelenskiy, a conversation that is at the heart of an impeachment inquiry. But it said he relented at the urging of Perry.\n\nPerry said he encouraged U.S. President Donald Trump to talk with Zelenskiy to build confidence among U.S. officials that the country was taking steps to fight corruption and improve transparency.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, I asked the president multiple times - \u2018Mr President, we think it is in the United States and the Ukraine\u2019s best interest, that you and the president of Ukraine have conversations, that you discuss the options that are there.\u2019 So absolutely, yes,\u201d Perry said in Vilnius.\n\nDuring the call in July, Trump pressed Zelenskiy for an investigation into former U.S. vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, according to a call summary released by the Trump administration.", "description": "U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Monday denied a report that he had pressed Ukraine to hire certain people to the board of its state-owned natural gas company, saying he had only recommended names at the Ukrainian government's request.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438153910&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960WN", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
