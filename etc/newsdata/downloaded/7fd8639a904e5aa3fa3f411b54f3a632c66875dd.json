Toyota gives the Diahatsu Copen a douse of Gazoo Racing performance", "language": "en", "text": "Toyota's performance arm Gazoo Racing, fettled with Diahatsu's little convertible and created the Copen GR Sport.\n\nThe two-seater convertible is an OEM car manufactured by Daihatsu Motor Co, of which Toyota is a wholly-owned subsidiary since 2016.\n\n\n\nDiahatsu had revealed its Copen GR Sport at the 2019 Tokyo Auto Salon several months ago. Then Toyota took the new model and tweaked the tiny roadster to make its own funky version with sportier equipment, interior and exterior enhances.\n\nExclusive to Japan\n\nIt is currently only available in Japan in a choice of eight body colours with pricing starting from an estimated R327 000 (2.3-million Yen). Not that it would ever be that \"cheap\" if it had to be imported here, pricing would be through the roof. It's a pity though because the Copen certainly was the coolest Daihatsu model to ever roam SA's streets.\n\nGALLERY | Toyota Copen GR SPORT\n\nPower comes from a 3-cylinder, 660cc turbocharged engine with an output of only 47kW and 92Nm. This coupled with a choice of a 5-speed manual or 7-speed CVT transmission delivers superior comfort of control. It makes for an ultra lightweight sports car perfect as a daily drive, with the addition of open-air motoring\n\nImage: Toyota\n\nThe core focus is on suspension and overall body rigidity that provides a smooth ride with supple movement, and the feeling of the tyre gripping performance. Characteristics famed of lightweight sports cars. It sits on a set of BBS forged-aluminum wheels covered in a special matte gray colour scheme.\n\nImage: Toyota\n\nExterior design is honed to performance starting with its 'Functional MATRIX' grille. The lower section of the bumper contributes to improved cooling while at the same time emphasising the low centre of gravity and styling.\n\nOn the inside is a pair of Recaro racing seats combined with a full black interior. There is also a triple meter display and special piano black-toned decorative centre cluster. The electrified Active Top comes as a standard feature.\n\nCompiled by: Robin Classen", "description": "Toyota took sporty new Diahatsu Copen and tweaked the tiny roadster to make its own GR Sport funky version with upgraded equipment, interior and exterior enhances.
