A cheap bone at that. The government has committed to maintain the corporation\u2019s principal source of funding for the duration of the current 11-year charter period. That takes us to 2027. There mightn\u2019t be a Tory Party left by that time. The way things are going, there mightn\u2019t be a United Kingdom either.\n\nThe second interpretation, and this is the one that should make some of those among Auntie\u2019s suits uncomfortable, is that she might have a point.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe licence fee, which is basically a poll tax, started to look anachronistic as soon as multi-channel pay TV had firmly established itself.\n\nIn the era of Netflix, Amazon Prime, and the battle royale that\u2019s about to take place between them and a rash of new competitors \u2013 Disney Plus, Apple TV, HBO Max (Warner Bros), and so on \u2013 it risks becoming a relic.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

What\u2019s that again?\n\nDo you think that young people who\u2019ve grown up with self-created stars like DanTDM (who\u2019s as hard working, personable and family friendly as any of the Beeb\u2019s roster) won\u2019t start to ask why they\u2019re being asked to shell out for a service they don\u2019t use alongside sky-high rent and crippling student loan repayments when they strike out on their own?\n\nSure, lots of people still watch Strictly and Doctor Who and EastEnders and suchlike. The Beeb\u2019s dramas continue to have the capacity to create a buzz and everyone\u2019s talking about David Attenborough\u2019s latest.\n\nPart of the rationale behind ITV pushing its own streaming venture is that British viewers seem to like British content like the aforementioned. Whether that will be enough to sustain BritBox remains to be seen. Its budget is tiny compared to those of the US giants. It will live or die by its library rather than on original content, at least in its early days.\n\nBut from the perspective of the BBC, BritBox is interesting. It\u2019s involved in the venture, which has been up and running in the US and Canada for some time. But its support looks tepid. It has a small equity stake and will contribute content only after it has been up on the iPlayer for a year.\n\nThat said, through being only loosely involved, the BBC can dip its toe in the subscription waters without being carried down the river, while its partner takes all the risk.\n\nWe\u2019re used to Auntie being portrayed as stuffy, slow moving, bureaucratic. But it also has some smart people and the way they\u2019ve played BritBox looks smart.\n\nWhile it might seem like heresy, I\u2019d be surprised if there weren\u2019t at least some at the corporation interested in exploring a subscription model more deeply, particularly if it would afford them more freedom, and leave them less in hock to Britain\u2019s fairly detestable current political class.\n\nThe implications would be far reaching, particularly for some of its less commercially viable output. You can start with Radio Four and move on from there.\n\nIf change is coming, it isn\u2019t going to happen soon. It\u2019s been made clear that wholesale reform of the TV licence isn't something high on the priority list for Morgan\u2019s department.\n\nBy far the biggest political issue regarding the licence is whether rich pensioners should be asked to pay it alongside young people who are struggling to make ends meet with the meagre wages that first jobs tend to pay.\n\nMorgan isn\u2019t going to intervene in the BBC\u2019s (correct) decision that they should.\n\nBut the debate about its long-term future isn\u2019t going anyway and it\u2019s only going to increase in intensity. The BBC would be wise to get ahead of it.", "description": "There are two possible interpretations that you can put on culture secretary Nicky Morgan telling MPs she was \u201copen minded\u201d about scrapping the BBC licence fee in favour of a Netflix-style subscription people would be able to opt out of.", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/15/tv-licence.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
