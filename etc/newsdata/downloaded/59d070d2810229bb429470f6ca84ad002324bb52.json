Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the advocate who led on the anti-prorogation case in Scotland, insisted the courts had a duty to ensure the prime minister was not abusing his powers.\n\nThe UK has a tripartite system, where parliament, the government and the courts each have a defined role in balancing out the others\u2019 decisions. O\u2019Neill successfully persuaded three senior Scottish judges 13 days ago that Johnson was abusing the government\u2019s powers to suspend parliament to prevent it from carrying out its constitutional duties to scrutinise and approve the government\u2019s decisions on Brexit.\n\nYet judges in London and Belfast had ruled in two very similar cases that Johnson did have the power to do so: they supported the government\u2019s views that prorogation was a political decision and that courts had no right to interfere.\n\nHow did it end up in the supreme court?\n\nThe competing English and Scottish court decisions were immediately sent to the UK supreme court on appeal; the judges rushed back from holiday to fast-track the hearing, allocating 11 judges \u2013 the largest number they can convene, to hear the case. (There are 12 judges on the court, but it must have an odd number sitting on the bench to prevent deadlock.)\n\nWhat exactly did the court have to decide?\n\nThe court had to decide firstly whether Johnson\u2019s decision \u2013 exploiting residual, royal prerogative powers \u2013 was \u201cjusticiable\u201d, meaning it could be subjected to the court\u2019s scrutiny under the constitution.\n\nIt then had to rule on whether the Scottish or English courts were right: was prorogation unconstitutional, or did Johnson have the right to organise parliamentary time as prime minister?\n\nThe final question the court addressed was what remedy it should grant if the prorogation was deemed unlawful.\n\nQuick guide The six key paragraphs in the supreme court's verdict Show Hide That the court judgment was not about Brexit \u201cIt is important, once again, to emphasise that these cases are not about when and on what terms the United Kingdom is to leave the European Union. They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d That the court had the right to act \u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019 \u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the vonstitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful \u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c That parliament has not been prorogued \u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d What happens next? \u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d The full judgment and the summary judgment can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.\n\nPlay Video Supreme court rules prorogation 'unlawful, void and of no effect' \u2013 video\n\nWhat conclusions did it reach?\n\nThe 11 judges ruled unanimously. They said the case was \u201cjusticiable\u201d and subject to the law. Giving the judgment, Lady Hale said: \u201cThe courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201d\n\nThey then ruled that the decision to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had \u201cthe effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201d She added: \u201cNo justification for taking action with such an extreme effect has been put before the court.\u201d\n\nIn the most striking part of its ruling, the court said the speakers in both the Commons and Lords can reconvene both houses immediately. The judges upheld the court of session\u2019s ruling that prorogation was void. They also stated that the privy council\u2019s decision to ask the Queen to suspend parliament was also \u201cunlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed\u201d. In effect, Hale said \u201cparliament has not been prorogued\u201d.\n\nPlay Video 1:42 Parliament to resume after supreme court ruling, says Bercow \u2013 video\n\nWhat next?\n\nImmediately after the court said the next steps would be up to the speakers of the two houses, John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, said the Commons had to \u201cconvene without delay\u201d and that he would urgently consult all party leaders about doing so. That could mean the Conservative conference, due to start this weekend, would need to be cut short.\n\nAt the Labour conference, Jeremy Corbyn said parliament should immediately be recalled. The prime minister, meanwhile, must decide whether to return from the UN general assembly in New York.\n\nIf he does return, Johnson could simply allow parliament to sit; seek to prorogue again, arguing that a shorter, \u201cnormal\u201d prorogation ahead of a Queen\u2019s speech is not ruled out by the court\u2019s judgment but risking accusations that he could precipitate a constitutional crisis; or, as Corbyn and others call for his resignation, he could try to force an election.", "description": "A reminder of what was at stake in hearing on Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament", "authors": ["Severin Carrell", "Martin Kettle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68a73dc5a05839de91d77ed0400cd09373ca37c0/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1e95b474d0e03f25a32ef4fa9c672788", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
