PTON\u2019s IPO\u2019ed at $29 per share and broke down 11% to below $26 in its first 4 hours of trading. This appears to be par for the course as investors lose their appetite for unprofitable IPOs.\n\nPTON\u2019s offering was the second-worst debut of the year, following SmileDirectClub\u2019s SDC IPO on September 12th, which experienced an almost 30% price drop on its first day of trading.\n\nPeloton Issue\n\nPeloton\u2019s prospectus illustrates the company has been driving a strong topline but at escalating costs. The firm\u2019s revenue has grown 4-fold over the past 2 years, but its losses have quadrupled in just one year.\n\nThe high customer acquisition costs have been weighing heavy on the company\u2019s ability to profit. Luckily the firm has been able to secure a 95% retention rate and long-run reoccurring revenue from the subscription that comes with the products.\n\nPTON is trading at a 7.8x P/S, which is not outrageous for a firm that has been doubling its topline, but investors are concerned about the sustainability of its growth.\n\nPeloton\u2019s business model is easily replicated, and it is already facing increasing competition with Equinox\u2019s SoulCycle about to release their own at home bike and virtual classes. The business model isn\u2019t proprietary, and I do not think that its current growth rate is maintainable.\n\nPeloton\u2019s opening day slump is just another example of an unprofitable, shaky business model getting what it deserves in the markets.\n\nThe 2019 IPO Landscape\n\nThis year\u2019s IPOs market is redder than it has been in almost two decades as 76% of firms enter the market with a loss on their income statement. Investors\u2019 attraction to money hemorrhaging companies is coming to an end as our economic cycle is ostensibly about to expire.\n\nThe distress started with Lyft\u2019s LYFT IPO back at the end of March. Investors were overzealous about the first ride-hailing firm hitting the public exchanges and drove the stock price up 10% on the first day of trading. This excitement quickly turned to panic, with the stock losing over 20% of its value in the first month and has lost almost 50% since its opening day close.\n\nUber UBER experienced a similar narrative, though investors were much more cautious when these shares started trading in May. UBER is down 24% since its first day of trading.\n\nBoth ride-hailing firms have business models that continue to lose an increasing amount of money. They lose money on almost every ride with the goal being to bleed out every other competitor with the lowest prices. This business model doesn\u2019t drive up valuations with shareholders just hoping they aren\u2019t holding a position in the losing firm.\n\nSlack WORK is another example of an enterprise that is being overrun by competition. It is a collaborative platform with the goal of making email obsolete. Unfortunately, this model is easily replicated and has been by Microsoft Teams MSFT, which is already brought in more daily active users in 2 years than Slack has been able to in 6. WORK has lost over 40% of its value since its offering in June.\n\nWeWork was planning on going public this month but had to delay its IPO indefinitely as the shares saw a lack of interest in the public market. WeWork is a real estate company trying to sell itself as a tech company. Its business model is a commercial real estate firm at best and a Ponzi scheme at worst. Its last round of funding valued the company at $47 billion, and today analysts are saying the company value is closer to $10 billion.", "description": "The 2019 IPO market has been underlined by red on the income statement and disappointed investors.", "authors": ["Daniel Laboe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5bEn8Og5rmL718ccj4zlmw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/e7af58871e07a5208f48fce0b12c8918", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
