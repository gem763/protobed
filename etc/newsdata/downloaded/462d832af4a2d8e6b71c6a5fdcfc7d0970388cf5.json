(Bryan Woolston/Reuters)\n\nAfter another mass shooting over the weekend, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remained noncommittal Tuesday about bringing new gun safety legislation to a vote, instead putting the onus on the White House to first decide what it would support.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican was asked during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt specifically about a House-passed bill to expand background checks on firearm sales, which has stalled in Congress since the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Conn.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re in discussions about what to do on the gun issue in the wake of these horrendous shootings,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI said several weeks ago if the president took a position on a bill so that we knew we\u2019d actually be making a law, I\u2019d be happy to put it on the floor.\u201d\n\nMcConnell said he expected the administration to give him an answer on what President Trump is prepared to support next week.\n\nAfter each mass shooting during his presidency, Trump has wavered over how to address the nation\u2019s gun violence epidemic. He has suggested support in the past for closing loopholes in background check laws for gun purchases, but then would reverse his stance.\n\n\u201cIf the president is in favor of a number of things he has discussed openly and publicly and I know we will pass it, and it\u2019ll become law, I\u2019ll put it on the floor,\u201d McConnell told Hewitt.\n\n[Texas\u2019s second mass shooting during August kills at least 7]\n\nIn August, three mass shootings claimed the lives of 38 people, including Saturday\u2019s shooting rampage in Odessa and Midland, Tex. Earlier in the month, back-to-back shootings at a Walmart in El Paso, and in a historic nightlife district in Dayton, Ohio, renewed the calls to pass stricter gun laws.\n\nTrump, on Sunday, told reporters that the latest mass shooting \u201creally hasn\u2019t changed anything\u201d regarding the discussion among lawmakers about gun policy.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s reticence to take a stance on the issue earned him the nickname \u201cMassacre Mitch\u201d in the summer as Democrats grew increasingly frustrated with his refusal to assure Senate action.\n\n\u201cTime\u2019s up, @SenateMajLdr,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted after Saturday\u2019s Texas shooting. \u201cLet\u2019s vote on gun safety legislation NOW. Every day you wait, more tragedies happen. Do something, Senator McConnell. America is done waiting for you.\u201d\n\nThe House, which passed its background checks bill in a 240-190 vote earlier in the year, is planning to take up additional gun control bills in the fall. The House Judiciary Committee had scheduled to debate the bills this week but postponed its meeting due to Hurricane Dorian.", "description": "The Senate majority leader left it up to President Trump to say what gun laws he would support.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png"}
