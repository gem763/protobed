The state broadcaster China Central Television and the livestreaming platform Tencent Sports both said they would no longer broadcast Rockets games.\n\nThe NBA then went into damage control, with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver putting out two statements in an attempt to clarify the league's position and their relationship with China.\n\nOn Monday, James spoke with reporters for the first time about the ongoing controversy, staying on a similar line that the league took and saying that Morey hadn't considered the ramifications of his words.\n\n\"We all talk about this freedom of speech,\" James said. \"Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others, and you're only thinking about yourself. I don't want to get in a word sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke. And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.\"\n\nJames caught criticism from fans, many of whom were disappointed that James had decided against standing with Morey and in support of the protests.\n\n\"there are ramifications for not thinking about others and only thinking about yourself\" is for sure a take when discussing a pro-democracy protest https://t.co/YkGmhu5Qhs \u2014 Robby Kalland #BriocheBoys (@RKalland) October 15, 2019\n\nOn Tuesday, the Associated Press photographer Mark Schiefelbein captured images of protesters in Hong Kong burning James' jersey. According to Schiefelbein, protesters threw basketballs at an image of James and chanted their anger at the Lakers superstar.\n\nJames had attempted to walk back his initial comments on Monday night on Twitter.\n\n\"Let me clear up the confusion,\" James tweeted. \"I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I'm not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that.\"\n\n\"My team and this league just went through a difficult week,\" James said. \"I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, James was asked about the criticism he had received. He reiterated his belief that it was a complex issue and indicated that he didn't plan on commenting further on the matter.\n\n\"I talked about it yesterday,\" James said. \"I tweeted out a couple responses to people not understanding my knowledge, and where it came from, and me learning from the situation. I'm talking about it now. And I probably won't talk about it again because I'd be cheating my teammates.\"\n\nI asked LeBron James on his response to the criticism on not speaking out on a freedom of speech/human rights issue.
