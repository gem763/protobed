(Shutterstock)\n\nIf you want to understand how the peach emoji has come to represent both the potential impeachment of President Trump and a butt, you must first look to the ancient Sumerians.\n\nCuneiform, their early system of writing, began as a series of pictograms, and some characters represented multiple words or concepts. But it could be \u201ctricky to represent something in the abstract,\u201d said Vyvyan Evans, a British linguistics professor, and author of \u201cThe Emoji Code.\u201d So the Sumerians would repurpose an existing pictogram that had resonance with the hard-to-illustrate concept. A modern-day equivalent would be using a picture of an eye to represent \u201cI\u201d \u2014 a linguistic concept called the Rebus Principle.\n\nThe singer Lizzo may not have known she was referencing 6,000 years of the evolution of human language last Tuesday when she tweeted a message that now has more than 120,000 likes \u2014 and helped take the peach from sexualized to politicized.\n\nIM\ud83c\udf51MENT \u2014 |L I Z Z O| (@lizzo) September 24, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s not what a peach emoji usually means \u2014 and if you didn\u2019t already know that, well, bless your heart. Designers have presented the emoji peach in slightly varying ways across digital platforms, but most show it with a rather well-defined crease. In botany, this is called the suture, and it gives drupe fruits, a category that includes peaches, plums and olives, a seam that can split to release its seed-bearing pit.\n\nIn Internet culture . . . well, there\u2019s no delicate way to say this. That crease represents a butt crack. Though Apple briefly threatened to change the design of the beloved sexting emoji to make it less derriere-like in 2016, it reversed course, giving us the luscious, juicy peach we have on our phones today.\n\n\u201cMany of the findings that we\u2019re looking at within the realm of the emoji language is that they\u2019re kind of following the same patterns that words do. So they\u2019ll pick up new meanings the same way that words will,\u201d said Benjamin Weissman, a lecturer at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, who has studied the way that our brains interpret emoji. Unicode, the group that maintains character software standards, considers \u201cnotable metaphorical references or symbolism\u201d in its selection criteria for new emoji.\n\nSo when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated impeachment proceedings against President Trump last week, pro-impeachment Twitter users began making the connection between peaches and article I, section 2, clause 5 of the Constitution.\n\nIn certain online circles, the peach is becoming a protest emoji \u2014 much like how some use the rose emoji to signify that they are supporters of the Democratic Socialists of America. Impeachment supporters put it in their Twitter bios. The 1995 song \u201cPeaches\u201d by the band Presidents of the United States of America has become suddenly relevant again. D.C. bars put punny peach-flavored drinks on the menu. Maureen Dowd reinforced the connection in her Sept. 27 column, \u201cImpeaching the Peach One.\u201d\n\nSales of Trump-themed peach emoji stickers and pins have picked up in the last week on illustrator Nick Lacke\u2019s Etsy store. He first designed the impeachment pins a year after the election, as a follow-up to another successful pin of his, which featured the poop emoji with the president\u2019s face. He appreciated the multiple layers of meaning in the peach emoji \u2014 the impeachment pun, the color of the fruit evoking the president\u2019s tanned skin tone and the original slang meaning of the peach emoji.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018oh he\u2019s a buttface,\u2019 so it\u2019s like, very intellectual, multilayered high art, I like to think,\u201d he joked. \u201cEnamel pin culture is about having a visual marker for different aspects of your personality and your interests. . . . It\u2019s less me being like, \u2018I think he should get impeached,\u2019 and more me creating something for people to get a laugh out of.\u201d\n\nBut linguistically, the peach emoji is an interesting case. \u201cMost of the secondary or double meaning uses of emojis don\u2019t have to do with the sound of the word,\u201d said Weissman. It\u2019s not the first time an emoji has had several layers of meaning, he said, \u201cBut it seems to be the most prominent case of it being used phonetically.\u201d\n\nAs for whether that meaning will last \u2014 well, that depends on the Democrats, the investigation, and on how much the protest peach takes off.\n\n\u201cHow deeply entrenched it becomes in the public psyche will depend upon patterns of usage, and that includes not just the number of people that use it. It also includes the frequency, [and] crucially, who uses it,\u201d said Evans.\n\nCertainly it helps if it\u2019s being used by someone like Lizzo, who seems to be fully embracing both meanings of the peach emoji. Two days after her tweet, she posted an Instagram video from a concert. \u201cFor those who don\u2019t know, let me spell it out for you,\u201d she said, as she turned around and bent over, wearing a gold bodysuit. \u201cIm . . . Peach . . .\u201d \u2014 and here she tapped her left butt cheek \u2014 \u201c. . .Ment,\u201d she said, with a tap to the right.", "description": "No longer just for sexting or cobbler, everyone\u2019s favorite thicc stone fruit is now a juicy anti-Trump symbol.", "authors": ["Maura Judkis", "Reporter Covering Culture", "Food", "The Arts", "October At Am", "Maura Judkis Is A Reporter For The Washington Post", "Covering Culture", "The Arts.
