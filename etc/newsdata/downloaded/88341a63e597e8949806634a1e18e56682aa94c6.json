Ending days of dissembling, he confirmed that he was a participant in the July 25 phone call during which Mr. Trump pushed Ukraine\u2019s president to undertake political investigations, including of Joe Biden. And Mr. Pompeo said, accurately, that U.S. policy toward Ukraine has been \u201cconsistent\u201d for some time in seeking to counter \u201cthe threat that Russia poses\u201d to the country and in helping the Ukrainians get \u201cgraft . . . and corruption [out] of their government.\u201d\n\nWhat the secretary of state did not acknowledge is that he allowed Mr. Trump and lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to trash that policy. Mr. Pompeo did nothing to stop Mr. Giuliani from allying himself with some of Ukraine\u2019s most corrupt figures to peddle false stories about Mr. Biden, as well as conspiracy theories about Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election. One of those tales \u2014 that the hacking of the Democratic National Committee was done not by Russia but by Ukrainians \u2014 is a classic piece of disinformation that serves Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s campaign to undermine Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Pompeo listened on July 25 while Mr. Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate that theory as well as the false story that Mr. Biden sought the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son. He listened while Mr. Trump slandered the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch \u2014 a dedicated Foreign Service professional \u2014 whose tour in Kiev Mr. Pompeo had cut short.\n\nMs. Yovanovitch boldly campaigned against Ukrainian government corruption. Her reward was a humiliating recall and a promise by Mr. Trump that \u201cshe is going to go through some things.\u201d Meanwhile, according to the rough transcript released by the White House, Mr. Trump never mentioned \u201cgraft\u201d or \u201ccorruption\u201d to Mr. Zelensky, much less \u201cthe threat that Russia poses.\u201d Mr. Pompeo\u2019s claim that the conversation was \u201cin the context\u201d of long-standing U.S. policy is demonstrably false.\n\nSo, too, was Mr. Pompeo\u2019s assertion that a request by House committees for depositions from Ms. Yovanovitch and other State Department officials was improper. Mr. Pompeo claimed the committees had not followed proper procedure or given the officials enough time to prepare. He insisted that State Department lawyers must be present at all depositions to prevent the disclosure of \u201cprivileged information.\u201d The House committee chairmen correctly interpreted this bluster: Mr. Pompeo, they said, was \u201cintimidating Department witnesses in order to protect himself and the President.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFortunately, one of those witnesses, former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt D. Volker, is due to testify on Thursday, and Ms. Yovanovitch has reportedly been scheduled for next week. They and other State Department professionals should not hesitate to tell Congress the truth about how Mr. Pompeo enabled the destruction of U.S. diplomacy.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump used his office for political gain.
