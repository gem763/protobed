I'm happy about my victory.\"\n\nThere has been much attention on Andreescu since she beat Serena Williams in the US Open final and she started confidently in her first appearance at the season-ending showpiece.\n\nIn a matchup of the past two Grand Slam champions, Andreescu dictated early from the baseline and ruthlessly pounced on Halep's tentative serve to break three times in a dominant opening set.\n\nIt was a see-saw in the second set with both players struggling to hold serve before Halep produced her best when it mattered most to force a deciding set.\n\nAndreescu received medical attention on her lower back between sets and she appeared lethargic in the deciding set as a rejuvenated Halep took full advantage.\n\n\"I didn't take my chances in the second set, so I'm really disappointed about that,\" said Andreescu who declined to go into details about her back injury.\n\nThe No.4 seed lost for just the sixth time in 54 matches this season, where she started the year ranked 178.\n\n- 'Last chance' for Svitolina -\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier, Svitolina continued her dominance over Pliskova to start her title defence impressively. It was Svitolina's fourth straight victory over a misfiring Pliskova who had 42 unforced errors.\n\nThe 25-year-old is hoping to end a barren season on a high having not captured a title since last year's WTA Finals triumph.\n\n\"This is my last chance (this season),\" Svitolina told reporters. \"That's the biggest motivation for me. I always try to bring my best game.\"\n\nIt was a disappointing result for Pliskova who started well, mixing trademark hard-hitting blows from the baseline with softer touch, but Svitolina slowly clawed her way back into the match.\n\nIt was a tense contest extending into a nerve-jangling tiebreaker with Pliskova's bold approach saving six set points, but she miscued on the seventh as the Ukrainian finally drew first blood.\n\nA frustrated Pliskova was broken immediately to open the second set and never seriously threatened to stage a comeback against an increasingly confident Svitolina.\n\nPliskova, who has a tour-leading four titles this season, rued the marathon tiebreaker where she failed to convert a set point.\n\n\"I think that decided the match,\" she said. \"Even though I had some chances in the second set, the first set was a big part of the match.\"", "description": "Wimbledon champion Simona Halep saved a match point in the second set and then powered to a rousing comeback victory over Canadian sensation Bianca Andreescu at the WTA Finals on Monday.
