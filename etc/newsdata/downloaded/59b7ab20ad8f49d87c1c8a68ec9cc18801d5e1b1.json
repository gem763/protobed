According to forecasters, the storm came to a halt after a high-pressure ridge pushing the storm westward died out, leaving the hurricane in a \u201cholding pattern\u201d over Grand Bahama island, where it thrashed with sustained wind speeds of 185 mph and a storm surge as high as 23 feet.\n\nDuring the storm, images showed staggering levels of flooding and rainfall, with as much as 30 inches falling in some areas. The Grand Bahama International Airport in Freeport, the archipelago\u2019s second-largest city, was five feet underwater. On the Abaco island chain \u2014 less developed than the tourist areas of the country and populated by fishermen and Haitian migrants \u2014 thousands of homes are expected to have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nApparently, this is near Grand Bahama Int'l Airport in Freeport this AM. https://t.co/p7SFY9ipJa \u2014 Jonathan Erdman (@wxjerdman) September 2, 2019\n\nOn Tuesday, as the storm crept up the U.S. coast and southern states began to prepare for a weakened, but still potentially deadly, Category 2 storm, the accounting of the damage in the Bahamas began. The level of flooding from the enormous storm surge appeared to encompass close to half of the island of Grand Bahama. Abaco, too, was suffering from major flooding and devastating property damage. A Red Cross spokesman told the Associated Press that it is believed that 13,000 houses \u2014 nearly half of all the homes on Grand Bahama and Abaco \u2014 suffered severe damage or were entirely destroyed. U.N. officials say that over 60,000 people on the two islands need emergency food access, and that around 62,000 need access to clean water. The main hospital on Grand Bahama is reportedly unusable, while the hospital on Abaco desperately requires food, water, and medical supplies.\n\nThis will give you a bit more context to interpret the picture. pic.twitter.com/uRJYgYyEXP \u2014 Jonathan Amos (@BBCAmos) September 3, 2019\n\nThese satellite images show Grand Bahama before and after Hurricane Dorian's wrath https://t.co/wI8yQiHGkz pic.twitter.com/3budNTJ1nB \u2014 CNN (@CNN) September 3, 2019\n\nAerial photos of Abaco.

It\u2019s decimated. Apocalyptic. It looks like a bomb went off. It\u2019s not rebuilding something that was there. We have to start again.\u201d According to a contact on the island that spoke with her, there are \u201ca lot more dead\u201d than reported. Rescue efforts began Tuesday, and largely involved Bahamians aiding each other \u2014 some used their Jet-Skis to rescue people trapped on their roofs. Many shelters were also reportedly flooded or damaged, so housing victims will be another major challenge. On the island of Grand Bahama, over 400 people took refuge in the Grand Lucayan Resort and Casino.\n\nPrime Minister Hubert Minnis called the damage from Dorian, the strongest storm to ever hit the Bahamas, \u201cunprecedented.\u201d The Bahamian minister of foreign affairs, Darren Henfield, said multiple unconfirmed casualties have been reported. \u201cWe have reports of bodies being seen,\u201d Henfield said. \u201cWe cannot confirm those reports until we go out and see for ourselves.\u201d Five deaths have been officially reported so far.", "description": "Much of Grand Bahama was underwater on Tuesday following nearly two days of exposure to Hurricane Dorian, hampering rescue attempts to access victims of the hurricane, which hit the Bahamas as a Category 5.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/03/03-dorian-bahamas.w1200.h630.jpg"}
