David Kustoff: Impeachment Is Nothing More than a \u2018Time Suck\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. David Kustoff (R-TN) discussed impeachment on Breitbart News Daily on Friday and assessed that Congress will not be able to do anything of significance, legislatively, due to the \u201ccurrent toxic environment\u201d spurred by the left\u2019s impeachment efforts, describing impeachment as nothing more than a \u201ctime suck.\u201d\n\nThe Tennessee lawmaker discussed the ongoing impeachment battle in the nation\u2019s capital with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief and Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow, noting that Congress \u2013 particularly the Democrat-controlled House \u2013 is virtually at a stalemate due to the left\u2019s endless pursuit of impeachment:\n\nKustoff said his colleagues on the Hill say it is \u201cthe most contentious that they\u2019ve ever seen Washington and ever seen Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat should tell you the environment. And it means that we\u2019re not going to get anything done,\u201d he said, contrasting the deadlock with the promises House Democrats made prior to taking over the lower chamber.\n\nHe said nothing will get done legislatively, especially under Pelosi\u2019s leadership, because Congress \u201cdoesn\u2019t do a good job of walking and chewing gum at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Washington and Congress are going to be on an impeachment track, then that\u2019s it,\u201d Kustoff said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to handle any other issues other than impeachment, and obviously we\u2019re not doing that very well either\u2013 or they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to get any agreement on funding the government in the current toxic environment that we\u2019re in right now. So you go to the end of the year,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cIf we had that impeachment vote, and then you turn the page to January 1 and you start a presidential election year, and it goes downhill from there,\u201d he added.\n\nKustoff harkened to January, when the 116th Congress came into session, reminding listeners that many of the incoming freshmen Democrats had impeachment on their minds prior to coming into office, despite Pelosi\u2019s claims otherwise. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) infamously declared \u2013 on her first day in office \u2013 that they were going to \u201cimpeach the motherfucker.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was the attitude from the very beginning,\u201d Kustoff stated. \u201d It\u2019s been the attitude of some Democrats from the very beginning of the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nKustoff also reacted to Pelosi\u2019s stance that voters are \u201cnot going to decide\u201d where the impeachment efforts go from here, despite the upcoming election year.\n\n\u201cIt is completely the wrong attitude,\u201d Kustoff stated. \u201d We saw that at the beginning of the Trump administration.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
