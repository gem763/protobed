In Scotland, average prices rose 1.6% to \u00a3154,549; while England\u2014which is typically home to almost 80% of the U.K.\u2019s real estate transactions\u2014saw prices edge up 0.8% to \u00a3251,233.\n\n\n\nThe report only provided data for Northern Ireland\u2019s quarterly prices and found average prices increased 3.5% to \u00a3136,767 in the second quarter compared to the same time last year.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Former Mayfair Home of Aviation Tycoon Sir Frederick Handley Page Asks \u00a318.75M\n\n\u201cThe closer we come to an apparent EU exit, the more likely it is that even the most fearless home buyer or seller will hold tight until the dust has settled, and so further downward trends should be expected until the start of next year at the very least,\u201d said Marc von Grundherr, director of estate agency Benham and Reeves, in an email statement.\n\n\n\nOn a more local level, London was one of only two regions to see prices drop in August, falling 1.4% to \u00a3472,753. In the South East of England values fell 0.6% to \u00a3326,232.\n\n\n\nProspective London buyers who are currently waiting on the sidelines for some clarity around Brexit \u201cwould do well to strike while the iron is, well uncertain, as we will only see market values strengthen as time goes on,\u201d Mr. von Grundherr said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-117630?size=1.4253897550111359&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
