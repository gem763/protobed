Photo: Michael Dwyer/AP/Shutterstock\n\nBen: As President Trump and his allies launch attack after attack on Joe Biden and his family over their ties to Ukraine, baselessly accusing him of orchestrating the firing of a prosecutor there to protect his son, the Democratic contender has been fairly mild in his response. He has criticized Trump for the broadsides but not consistently, so the public may be left with the impression that he\u2019s not fighting back very aggressively. Biden\u2019s strategy, born in part out of his wish not to get dragged down to Trump\u2019s level and in part by his wish not to involve his son further in all of this, has left some allies baffled, as the New York Times reported over the weekend. What does it say about his readiness to take on Trump in what would undoubtedly be a vicious general-election campaign?\n\nEd: Oh, I dunno. Biden will have plenty of time to fight back. Maybe looking like the victim is his strategy right now. The bigger question is whether the whole brouhaha will hurt him whether or not he\u2019s pugilistic about it all. It\u2019s kind of a three-fer: He\u2019s in the news in a negative way just as he\u2019s bleeding support to a surging Elizabeth Warren and lagging in fundraising.\n\nEzekiel: It is unusual for Biden, but I think he probably has the right strategy in trying to just let Congress handle it. The other school of thought would be that Trump attacking him is good because it sucks up oxygen from other candidates and forces other Democrats to publicly defend him. But I think they\u2019re het up about it as it is.\n\nEd: Yeah, Cory Booker leaped to his defense today.\n\nBen: Is het up a phrase I don\u2019t know?\n\nEzekiel: Yeah, it means \u201cagitated.\u201d Ezekiel\u2019s Word of the Day.\n\nEd: Where I\u2019m from, we say \u201cgot all riled up.\u201d\n\nBen: That one I\u2019m familiar with.\n\nEzekiel: I believe het is derived from a colloquial past tense of heat. This is the chat now.\n\nBen: Ha, back to politics. Obviously, the situations are different, but watching Biden over the past few days, I have flashbacks to John Kerry in 2004 (swift boats) or Hillary Clinton in 2016 (emails). There\u2019s this notion that a candidate can simply ignore a made-up scandal and it will go away. But Trump is a master of repetition, and I think Biden risks letting him get away with quite a lot here.\n\nEzekiel: It would be different in an environment where impeachment weren\u2019t a near certainty.\n\nEd: I have to say, Biden\u2019s ability to get out of jams remains amazing. Speaking of three-fers, the day after the June debate, I observed that Biden\u2019s performance had hurt him in three ways: showed his age, showed his complacency, and exposed his potential weakness among African-Americans. It was so striking I got quoted on Meet the Press. Three weeks later, Biden was exactly where he was before in the polls. So I\u2019m not rushing into any claims that he\u2019s on the ropes. Yeah, his third-quarter fundraising was, as I wrote, \u201cmeh,\u201d but it\u2019s not like he won\u2019t meet payroll.\n\nBen: Yes, it\u2019s been something of a pastime here to count him out preemptively. But it\u2019s also true that he has trailed Warren in several recent polls \u2014 national and Iowa/New Hampshire \u2014 which wasn\u2019t the case before.\n\nEd: Well, this is precisely why Team Biden has shifted its spin into projecting a two-way race in which early Warren wins just qualify her for the Big Fight with Biden \u2014 instead of croaking him and everyone else.\n\nEzekiel: Obviously, so much of his appeal to Democrats is tied up in his appeal in the general election, and his pitch is on a return to normalcy so this stuff could hypothetically be damaging to his chances in the primaries even if Democrats don\u2019t buy it. But I don\u2019t know whether we know yet whether it actually is.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear to me whether that has anything to do with the allegations about his son. Has there been any polling from Democrats about that?\n\nEd: Don\u2019t know of any polling, Ezekiel. There\u2019s been some piling-on by lefty voices arguing that Hunter Biden is very relevant to the Democratic contest. Nothing by candidates. But it is worth asking if your average Democratic voter will hear all this and empathize with Biden as the father who has lost two children prematurely and can\u2019t really control his wayward son. Or if said voter will look at Hunter and see the very kind of person Warren and Sanders keep warning us about.\n\nEzekiel: I can very much imagine them empathizing with him and also voting against him.\n\nBen: On that topic, the allegation put forward by Trump is bogus, but Hunter\u2019s lucrative involvement with a Ukrainian gas company may not be something Biden wants to talk about. To what extent are Biden\u2019s hands tied here if he did choose to mount a more frontal assault on the president\u2019s claims?\n\nEzekiel: His hands aren\u2019t tied \u2014 the only option not available to him here is throwing his son under the bus.\n\nEd: He could in theory come right back and say, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about kids profiting from their father\u2019s power,\u201d and get people fired up about the Trump clan.\n\nEzekiel: But I think under the current situation, \u201cBiden Hits Back\u201d headlines are not really what he wants.\n\nBen: What does he want?\n\nEzekiel: \u201cDemocrats Proceed Toward Impeachment Hearings.\u201d\n\nBen: It\u2019s not like that\u2019s going to stop this talking point.\n\nEzekiel: Is hitting back going to stop the talking point? He doesn\u2019t want a back-and-forth over Hunter\u2019s behavior; he wants a back-and-forth over Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\nEd: Part of me thinks that, like everything else problematic about Biden, the contrast with Trump makes him and his restorationist message look better, even nostalgically good. But Ezekiel is right; he needs the spotlight to be elsewhere right now.\n\nBen: I think hitting back may neutralize the talking point more effectively than doing nothing. Hanging back risks Trump\u2019s owning the subject completely (yes, even during impeachment proceedings). But it also signals that Biden isn\u2019t quite ready to deal with all the other crap Trump will throw at him should he be the nominee.\n\nEzekiel: I don\u2019t agree. I think the situation would be different if he were actually the nominee, but in the primaries, I don\u2019t think it gets him anything.\n\nEd: I\u2019ve never thought Biden\u2019s electability advantage is attributable to the belief that he\u2019s a \u201cfighter.\u201d It\u2019s mostly the relatable Uncle Joe who has reasonable ambitions and doesn\u2019t frighten swing voters.\n\nBen: I agree, but you need to be a bit of a fighter against this opponent.\n\nEd: He\u2019s not exactly sitting in a corner whimpering. I think he and his people are weighing their options and doing hundreds of focus groups. Part of today\u2019s angst is from an article full of blind quotes from donors who are bitching about their investment. It\u2019s sort of what they do.\n\nEzekiel: I think this may or may not hurt Biden and he may or may not win the nomination, but I\u2019m not convinced that \u201chitting back\u201d would accomplish anything. In fact, if he did, I\u2019d start wondering if he were desperate.\n\nEd: I agree, and I think it\u2019s a natural time for him to sit back and see how the story rolls out. Strategically, Bernie\u2019s health problems and the failure of any other candidate to make a move means he really can take his time in the nomination race and try to position himself as the beneficiary of the inevitable jitters about Warren. And maybe not say anything weird at next week\u2019s debate!\n\nBen: I\u2019m not advocating that he focus on this all the time, but I think his response so far could have been a lot stronger and at no damage to his credibility or standing.\n\nEd: Speaking of the debate, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be asked about it, and the other candidates will probably feel called upon to defend him and attack Trump over it all. Again, he\u2019ll have his chances. And for all I know that\u2019s what he\u2019s waiting on, to Ben\u2019s great frustration.\n\nBen: \u201cNow look, this whole thing is a bunch of malarkey.\u201d\n\nEzekiel: Lol.\n\nEd: \u201cI was discussing this with Barack, and I said, \u2018Barack, this whole thing is a bunch of malarkey. Right, Barack?\u2019\u201d\n\nBen: Haha.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss Joe Biden\u2019s understated response to President Trump\u2019s attacks against him and whether his approach is hurting him in the race for the Democratic nomination.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hart", "Ed Kilgore", "Ezekiel Kweku"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/04/04-joe-biden.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
