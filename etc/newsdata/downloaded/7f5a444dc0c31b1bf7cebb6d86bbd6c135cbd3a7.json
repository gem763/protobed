The group named five board members \u2014 including Xapo CEO Wences Casares, Andreessen Horowitz partner and blockchain lead Katie Haun, and Facebook executive David Marcus, who has been the primary face of the project up until now.\n\n\u201ca world without financial borders, where everyone can prosper\u201d\n\nThe members also laid out a number of bylaws describing the process for electing new board members, voting on proposals, and adjudicating disputes.\n\n\u201cGiven the project\u2019s scale and ambition, there are still a number of challenges to overcome,\u201d Haun said in a statement, \u201cincluding regulatory compliance.\u201d\n\nThat compliance has been a particularly sore point for payment processors, many of whom left the association just days before the inaugural meeting. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe, and Mercado Pago were all initially signed on as founding members of the Libra Association, but none were present in Geneva, having dropped out in advance of the meeting.\n\nNotably, the bylaws also spell out that any member of the association may leave for any reason, although transferring membership is only allowed under more limited circumstances.\n\nOnly one payment processor remains involved with the Libra Association: PayU, a Dutch company focused on mobile and web payments in the European market. PayU had declined to comment in the wake of the earlier departures, but affirmed their commitment to the project at Monday\u2019s meeting. \u201cThe mission of the association,\u201d PayU said in a statement, \u201caligns seamlessly with PayU\u2019s vision of creating a world without financial borders, where everyone can prosper.\u201d", "description": "In Geneva on Monday, the remaining members of the Libra Association held their inaugural meeting, still reeling from the departure of Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, and others.", "authors": ["Russell Brandom", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yuDBII8tpczgtZPvToli-BuZJ-E=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16677181/VRG_ILLO_3512_001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
