In national emergency situations, it may be appropriate for government agencies to take swifter action.\u201d\n\nReservations to unilateral action\n\nAustralian Strategic Policy Institute senior analyst for cyber security Tom Uren said there was a case for government to place obligations on critical infrastructure and to direct private operators to take certain actions during an attack that became a national emergency.\n\n\u201cBut I think government unilaterally stepping against a disruptive attack from overseas assumes government knows more than the industry and I don\u2019t think that necessarily makes sense,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government is consulting with industry on what safeguards should be put in place to ensure its tools would be used appropriately, such as not having access to customer data on their electricity usage and sensitive personal financial information.\n\nThe government\u2019s Australian Cyber Security Centre estimates that there could be up to 50,000 vulnerable machines in Australia.\n\nThe move is part of a broader review to update the government's 2016 cyber security strategy to keep businesses and families safe online.", "description": "The Morrison government is working on new powers to allow security agencies to defend critical private sector infrastructure from a \"cyber Pearl Harbour\" attack as concerns rise that Chinese hackers could launch an economic assault.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6117%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_69%2C$y_219/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e6b0d340c6a125208d8d406d8ef34f319c9d454b", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
