I work from home. I love cooking. Put it all together and what do you get? Lots of cooking, that\u2019s what. And specifically lots of cooking using my 10-piece set of Calphalon Premier Space Saving Nonstick pots and pans.\n\nThat name has a fair amount to unpack, so let\u2019s start with the \u201cCalphalon.\u201d That\u2019s just the brand name, but if you know your way around all things culinary, you\u2019ll know they make excellent wares. Premier? Well, anyone can call anything premier, it\u2019s not an official term like, say, \u201corganic,\u201d but it\u2019s merited here, especially as we reach the \u201cspace-saving\u201d of it all.\n\nThe six-piece Premier Space Saving set can all be stacked in the space that would usually be occupied by a single 10-inch frying pan. The 8-inch pan, saucepan, and 3.5-quart pot sit one inside the other, with a lid and strainer that fit all but the largest pan resting in the stack as well. (And if you have the 10-piece set like I do, you can also make one single stack, but it gets a bit unwieldy, so just live with 10 pots, pans, and lids occupying the space of two standard frying pans.)\n\nMoving on to the nonstick. They\u2019re nonstick\u2014like truly minimal spray, oil, or butter needed during the cooking. But where these things are truly better than other cookware I\u2019ve used is in the clean up. Even fried or baked-on food gunk (yes, they\u2019re oven safe to 450\u00ba) lifts out with gentle pressure from a sponge or paper towel. And if that\u2019s too much work for you, you can run these pots and pans through the dishwasher, though I never do because I want them to last for years.\n\nAnd I want them to last mostly because they\u2019re awesome and I love them, but also because they\u2019re expensive. Worth it? Totally. Now excuse me, I have a steak to sear.
