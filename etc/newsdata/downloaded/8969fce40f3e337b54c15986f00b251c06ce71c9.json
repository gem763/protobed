He added: \"It seems more likely that we're going to find ourselves back in a familiar place where 90 percent of the Americans who want more background checks are going to be disappointed once again.\"\n\nDayton Mayor Nan Whaley, who spoke at the Pelosi-Schumer news conference, said she was in Washington demanding \"a simple vote on what nine out of 10 Americans agree on. I don't know of anything else that nine out of 10 Americans agree on except HR 8,\" referring to the House's background check bill.\n\nA bipartisan group of mayors met with high-ranking White House officials earlier on Monday to discuss gun legislation but gave no indication of an agreement between the two sides.\n\nTrump has said he favored action, possibly on tackling mental health issues related to gun violence or expanded background checks. The White House has yet to outline any specific proposals.\n\nBryan Barnett, mayor of Rochester Hills, Michigan, and the current head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said there was a \"robust\" discussion about gun legislation at the White House. He said the White House team talked about \"a suite of solutions\" and that background checks \"are certainly on the table.\"\n\nWhite House officials said last week the measures might include expediting the death penalty for mass shooters.", "description": "Democrats press for stricter U.S. gun-sale checks, Trump non-committal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF881Y8_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
