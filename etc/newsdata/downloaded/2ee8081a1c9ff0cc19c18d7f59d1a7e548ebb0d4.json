We are confident in the facts and look forward to seeing our company exonerated in court.\"\n\nThe New York attorney general's office had no immediate comment on Monday.\n\nThe attorney general sued Exxon in October 2018 under the Martin Act, a New York state law that had been used primarily to go after financial fraud.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed Exxon falsely told investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business using a \"proxy cost\" of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions.\n\nHowever, these proxy figures frequently were not used in its internal planning or cost assumptions, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe attorney general also accused the company of failing to account properly for the costs of potential regulation in determining the value of its oil and gas reserves, or whether to write down the value of its assets.\n\nMassachusetts is separately investigating whether Exxon concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels play in climate change.\n\nBoth Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying its own scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.\n\nThose reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.\n\nExxon and other oil companies including BP (LON: ) Plc, Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change.", "description": "Exxon to face trial in New York climate change investor fraud lawsuit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9L0XD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
