I'm going to wait and see what the judgement is.\n\n\"And I want to stress that this is a government that fully respects the law and fully respects the judiciary.\"\n\nThe PM added that it was \"sensible\" for MPs to have their say on Brexit - but there was \"ample time at the end of October for them to do just that\".\n\nDuring prorogation, the business of Parliament stops. This means any laws that have not been passed will fall.\n\nIt also means MPs are unable to put questions to ministers or scrutinise government legislation.\n\nMPs have no say over when and if Parliament is prorogued - it is done by the Queen, who acts on a request from the prime minister.\n\nThe three-day hearing at the highest court in the country dealt with two appeals - one from campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller, the second from the government\n\nMrs Miller was appealing the English High Court's decision to throw out her challenge to prorogation.\n\nThe government, on the other hand, was appealing the ruling from Scotland's Court of Session that the prorogation was \"unlawful\" and had been used to \"stymie\" Parliament.\n\nThe challenge to the prorogation in the Scottish Court was brought by 75 parliamentarians, including SNP MP Joanna Cherry.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Clive Coleman takes a look inside the UK's Supreme Court\n\nDuring the court case, government lawyer Lord Keen QC said prorogation was \"forbidden territory, which is a matter between the executive and Parliament\", and MPs \"had the tools\" to change the law if they did not like it.\n\nHowever, Lord Pannick QC, representing Mrs Miller, argued it \"was motivated, or at least strongly influenced\" by Mr Johnson's belief that Parliament was \"a threat to the implementation of his policies\".\n\nMr Johnson said he was proroguing Parliament at this time in order to hold a new Queen's Speech on 14 October to outline the government's legislative plans for the year ahead.\n\nHowever, the timing has been controversial, as it reduces the period Parliament is sitting in the run up to the Brexit deadline.\n\nSome MPs held protests in the chamber when the prorogation began earlier this month, with some MPs holding signs saying \"silenced\" while shouting: \"Shame on you.\"\n\nMr Johnson, who is in New York for a UN climate conference, said he hoped to \"make progress\" with a Brexit deal in meetings with other EU leaders later on Monday.\n\nBut he stressed the UK would leave regardless on 31 October, adding: \"I will not extend and I don't think, by the way, there is much appetite around the table for an extension either - people want to get this thing done.\"\n\nWhat could happen next?\n\nIf the government wins at the Supreme Court, then nothing changes - Parliament remains suspended until 14 October.\n\nBut things could get complicated if the justices decide Mr Johnson acted unlawfully.\n\nIn documents submitted to the court, the government said it could see three options if the court ruled against it - and in some scenarios, it might just suspend Parliament all over again.\n\nThe court might rule this suspension unlawful, but their reasons might leave open the possibility of proroguing Parliament for the same time period in a different, lawful way\n\nThe judges could decide that the only lawful option is for the prime minister to recall Parliament before 14 October. Lawyers for Mr Johnson said he would comply, but it would require \"extensive arrangements\" to draw up a new Queen's Speech and get ready for the ceremonial State Opening of Parliament\n\nThe judges could declare the suspension unlawful, and therefore Parliament remains in session as if it had never stopped. The government said it might still be able to consider suspending it again\n\nBut Lord Pannick said all the judges needed to do was declare the suspension unlawful. The prime minister would not have to take any action and the Speakers of the Commons and Lords could decide how to proceed.", "description": "Judges have been considering whether Boris Johnson's five-week prorogation was lawful.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7361/production/_108873592_hi056620212.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
