Though Lewandowski did not hold a White House job, he figures prominently in Volume 2 of the report, which found that Trump asked his former campaign chief to press then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curb the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nIn August, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) issued a subpoena for testimony from Lewandowski, who has publicly said he\u2019d be happy to testify and, as he put it during a Fox News radio interview, \u201cremind the American people that these guys are on a witch hunt, right?\"\n\nLewandowski\u2019s appearance before the committee represents a much-needed win for Democrats, who are struggling to haul key fact witnesses in the Mueller report to the Hill for further questioning. It would be the first appearance of such a fact witness since former White House communications director Hope Hicks testified behind closed doors in June. She repeatedly invoked claims of executive privilege to decline offering answers, and Democrats expect Lewandowski to be an even more evasive and combative witness.\n\nUnlike Hicks, however, Lewandowski will answer questions in an open hearing with the cameras rolling\u2014making him the first Trump associate to do so before Nadler\u2019s committee. The spectacle may inject some life into Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation, which Nadler and other leaders have made far more explicit over the summer ahead of a crucial crossroads this fall.\n\nThe committee also served subpoenas for two other Trump associates\u2014deputy White House chief of staff Rick Dearborn and former White House staff secretary Rob Porter\u2014to appear on Sept. 17, too. No testimony from either of those former officials has been confirmed.\n\nThe high-profile testimony will also come amid speculation that Lewandowski may mount a run for U.S. Senate in his home state of New Hampshire, which he has teased heavily in recent months.", "description": "Lewandowski will answer questions in an open hearing with the cameras rolling\u2014making him the first Trump associate to do so before Jerry Nadler\u2019s committee.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Erin Banco", "Congressional Reporter", "National Security Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2280,w_4054,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567877765/GettyImages-1158939906_h3hoyo", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
