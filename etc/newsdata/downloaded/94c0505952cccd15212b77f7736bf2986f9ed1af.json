Classy, and took a late intercept to rub salt in a gaping wound.\n\nHenry Slade 7 (Ford, 61)\n\nCleverly weighted grubber-kick for May\u2019s second. His skilful touches are under-rated at Test level.\n\nManu Tuilagi 7.5 (Joseph, 74)\n\nHas never played more Tests in a year than in 2019 \u2013 and how timely is that? Provides such power that the others can play around him.\n\nJonny May 9\n\nTwo tries in two minutes set England on their way. He now has 17 in his last 20 Tests \u2013 a phenomenal record.\n\nJonny May went over twice in the first half to ease England's nerves in the first half\n\nOwen Farrell 8.5\n\nIt turns out he is pretty good at fly-half. An hour of dictating the play before Ford entered, kicked all of his goals and lead England superbly. 2015 put to bed for him and many others.\n\nBen Youngs 7.5 (Heinz, 74)\n\nHas played, and beaten, Australia more than any other Englishman. This was his 11th win against the old enemy \u2013 and the sweetest.\n\nMako Vunipola 7.5 (Marler, 69)\n\nLooked absolutely shattered when taken off, with a blood-stained shirt too. His handling in close-quarters gives England such an edge, and scrums well too.\n\nJamie George 7.5 (Cowan-Dickie, 69)\n\nExcellent across the field, as is the norm, and the missed lineout was not his fault as Curry dropped a dolly.\n\nKyle Sinckler 9 (Cole, 63)\n\nScrum penalties had England fans worried early on, but grew spectacularly and scored a key try with a stunning short line \u2013 his first in Tests \u2013 an amazing turnover too to cap his best ever England game.\n\nKyle Sinckler scored a crucial try early after Australia had reduced the deficit to one\n\nMaro Itoje 7.5\n\nLineout good under his spell, and is always the one to rile up opponents and several times stood with arms aloft after key turnovers. Could become an icon.\n\nCourtney Lawes 7 (Kruis, 63)\n\nFourteen hits in just over an hour before Kruis came on to see out the game. Powerful work.\n\nTom Curry 9.5\n\nBreakdown work and tackling extraordinary in tandem with Underhill. Easy to forget he is just 21 years old. If not world-class already, it is only a matter of time.\n\nSam Underhill 8.5 (Ludlam, 69)\n\nHe and fellow \u2018Kamikaze Kid\u2019 fired brilliantly to over-awe the fabled \u2018Pooper\u2019 axis of Hooper and Pocock. England\u2019s is the new youthful version.\n\nBilly Vunipola 7.5\n\nReckons he plays better with brother Mako, and as long as they are both in this team England have serious firepower. Yet to really explode too.\n\nTom Curry got through some exceptional work at the breakdown against Australia\n\nAUSTRALIA\n\nKurtley Beale 4\n\nOne of two probing breaks, and one great one, but his intercepted pass to Anthony Watson sealed Australia\u2019s fate.\n\nReece Hodge 7\n\nOff the scale pass that made space to Koroibete to score. Not been seen since being sent off against Fiji. Been missed.\n\nJordan Petaia 6\n\nBig chance for a big youngster who had not started a Test before this World Cup but better days will come.\n\nSamu Kerevi 5\n\nEngland built their midfield selection because of Kerevi\u2019s form but he failed to make inroads in the heavy traffic.\n\nMarika Koroibete 8\n\nAn outrageous piece of skill to skin Elliot Daly for his try and the Aussies should have got him on the ball more.\n\nMarika Koroibete was Australia's standout performer in an otherwise disappointing display\n\nChristian Lealiifano 5\n\nOne of the great stories of the tournament after his recovery from serious illness but not on it in Tokyo.\n\nWill Genia 6\n\nUsual nuisance around the base of the breakdown but could not get on top of England\u2019s back row.\n\nScott Sio 6\n\nHad a decent tussle with Kyle Sinckler in the early exchanges and milked a couple of penalties from the England prop.\n\nTolu Latu 6\n\nSecond best to Jamie George up front but did pull off one brilliant tackle as the Aussies defended desperately in the first half.\n\nAllan Alaalatoa 6\n\nJust lasted 61 minutes, about average for a prop nowadays, but had a decent scrap with Mako Vunipola.\n\nChristian Lealiifano's tournament ended in despair despite his recovery from illness\n\nIzack Rodda 4\n\nBeen bang in form for Australia in this tournament but met his match in England\u2019s locks and is a step behind Maro Itoje.\n\nRory Arnold 5\n\nFailed to make an impact before being substituted on 68 minutes and like plenty of other Wallabies was off the pace.\n\nDavid Pocock 4\n\nNot been at his best here in Japan and did not hit the peaks here either. Not a fitting end to a fine Test career.\n\nMichael Hooper 6\n\nPlayed a captain\u2019s knock but struggled against Sam Underhill and Tom Curry. The new kids on the back row block.\n\nIsi Naisarani 5\n\nWas supposed to be the big ball carrying option to have a crack but it didn\u2019t materialise.\n\nIt was a sad end to a brilliant Test career for David Pocock who is retiring\n\nReplacements\n\nJordan Uelese 4, James Slipper 5, Taniela Tupou 4, Adam Coleman 4, Lukhan Salakaia-Loto 4, Nic White 5, Matt To'omua 6, James O'Connor 4", "description": "WILL KELLEHER AND ADAM HATHAWAY IN OITA: England reached the semi-finals of the World Cup by thrashing Australia 40-16.
