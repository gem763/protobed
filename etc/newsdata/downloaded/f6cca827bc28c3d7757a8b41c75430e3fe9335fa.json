So right on schedule, the company has refiled plans to build a network operations center (NOC) in the shape of a giant glass dome.\n\nThe dome, which will contain both the NOC and an auditorium, was initially revealed in early September \u2014 but Foxconn yanked the plans on literally the same day, and didn\u2019t comment on whether the dome would come back. Now it\u2019s back \u2014 Foxconn apparently reworked the plans for the data center next to the dome to make it a more permanent structure.\n\n\u201cThe glass dome structure is largely the same; what they did do was flesh out the design for the related server building,\u201d Sam Schultz, community development director for Mount Pleasant, told the Racine Journal Times.\n\nSadly, the dome looks nothing like the fantastical concept video rendering of the campus Foxconn first released last year \u2014 a video that was quietly pulled from Foxconn\u2019s press materials after Wisconsin state representative Gordon Hintz pointed out that several scenes were actually footage of a park in England. It\u2019s still on Mount Pleasant\u2019s YouTube channel, though:\n\nFoxconn first announced plans to build a massive Generation 10 LCD fabrication facility in Wisconsin, only to cancel those plans and then finally agree to build a smaller Gen 6 LCD fab after a personal call from President Trump to then-Foxconn chairman Terry Gou. The million square-foot Gen 6 factory, which is one-twentieth the size of the originally promised fab and about the size of an Amazon warehouse, is currently under construction. However, no customers for the panels it will produce have been announced, and Wisconsin\u2019s governor says it will only produce 1,500 jobs, not the 13,000 jobs originally promised.\n\nFoxconn has said that it will build automated coffee kiosks and old-school alarm system controls in a different factory on the site, in what an exec called a \u201chigh-mix, low-to-medium volume\u201d production strategy. And, of course, the company\u2019s \u201cAI 8K+5G ecosystem\u201d strategy and \u201cinnovation centers\u201d around Wisconsin are still a mystery \u2014 it\u2019s been 193 days since Foxconn promised a statement or correction regarding The Verge\u2019s reporting that the innovation centers were actually empty.\n\nIn related news, Racine County has issued $110 million in bonds to refinance the debt it took on buying land for Foxconn as part of the project \u2014 debt that ultimately led to a reduction in the county\u2019s credit rating.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the prospectus issued with the bonds says \u201cno assurance can be provided as to the specific type, size, scope or generation\u201d of Foxconn\u2019s factory. But at least Wisconsin is getting a giant new dome.", "description": "AI 8K+5G, now in a sphere", "authors": ["Nilay Patel", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8shRK4MLuwhO0fGJBpRFwJP7DaE=/0x0:1200x628/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19310266/5dae0c2786bb7.image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
