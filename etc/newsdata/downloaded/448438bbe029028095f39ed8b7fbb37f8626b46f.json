Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\u201d Morey said in the statement.\n\nThe Biden campaign reportedly did not return a New York Post request for comment Monday night.\n\nBiden\u2019s stance on abortion has for decades been aligned with the more conservative wing of the Democratic Party (and Catholic orthodoxy) \u2014 but earlier this year he announced his opposition to the Hyde Amendment, a ban on federal funding for abortions.\n\nBiden said in June that he opposes the Hyde Amendment after days of Democratic backlash over his having voiced support for the amendment. \u201cIf I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone\u2019s ZIP code,\u201d he explained in a speech at the time.\n\nA previous version of this report appeared at NYPost.com.\n\nRead on: Wall Street is way too paranoid about a President Elizabeth Warren", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden, a lifelong Roman Catholic and a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, reportedly was denied communion by...", "authors": ["Ben Feuerherd"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD735_biden_ZG_20190211135403.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
