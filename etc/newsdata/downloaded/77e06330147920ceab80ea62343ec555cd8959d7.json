He\u2019s recently released his debut novel, The Lesson, a story of alien first contact over the Virgin Islands.\n\nThe novel is an excellent read. It explores the history of the Caribbean Islands in the context of European colonization, along with current events in which communities of color are confronted with overwhelming forces that deal out harsh punishments. It\u2019s a thought-provoking and interesting story, one that I\u2019m still thinking about.\n\nHere are 15 new science fiction and fantasy novels (and some related nonfiction books) to check out in the later half of this month.
