It will be possible then to secure the court\u2019s assistance if the Prime Minister has flouted the law and the promises he gave to the court.\u201d\n\nAsked if the Prime Minister would send the letter, a No10 source said: \u201cYou heard the PM\u2019s words. We are not going to add anything.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson insisted that he was not \"daunted or dismayed\" by the result and remained committed to taking Britain out by October 31.\n\nAsked if previous statements from ministers that the Government would comply with the law still stood, the Prime Minister's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: \"Governments comply with the law.\"\n\nMPs in the House of Commons (UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag) More\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned Mr Johnson that he could not ignore the provisions of the Benn Act, saying: \"The Prime Minister must now comply with the law.
