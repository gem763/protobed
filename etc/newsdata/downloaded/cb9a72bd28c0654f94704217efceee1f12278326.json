She said even the scholar transport vehicles were not allowed to operate.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s now the second week of the protest and there is still no indication if we will be able to go back to school or even write exams. We are really hurt by this because our future is in jeopardy. We just want to get on with our academic programme,\u201d said Vumsindo, who wants to be a doctor.\n\nNombuyekezo Mdliki (17), who is in Grade 12, said she was upset because her final exams were only 10 days away.\n\n\u201cOther children in other schools are doing revisions while we are stuck here, not knowing what to do. It is not even easy to study by yourself at home because we are used to doing everything at school,\u201d she said.\n\nMandisa Ngxuku (18), who is repeating Grade 11, was also concerned about the lost time.\n\n\u201cAll I want is to be at school to make sure that I do not repeat this grade again and that I get good marks to realise my dream of becoming an architect.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, there was some good news for pupils as the 35 schools finally reopened, DispatchLive reported.\n\nProvincial education spokesperson Malibongwe Matima had previously said their engagements with community leaders had yielded no results, but in a statement on Monday, Education MEC Fundile Gade said a deal had been brokered.\n\n\u201cThese engagements between government and the community, demonstrates the commitment of the provincial government in resolving urgent matters that confront our communities.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have been able to intervene in ensuring that learners from all schools including the 367 Grade 12 learners from the five affected high schools are back in class. We have called upon the circuit to work with these schools to ensure that all our learners have a clear plan of revision. This will assist the learners to continue to prepare for their final examinations,\u201d Gade said in a statement on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe future of our children should be a priority and not be used to get other services delivered,\u201d Gade previously told City Press.\n\nHowever, Thembikosi Gwaji chairperson of the St Barnabas Hluleka Development Forum, said they resorted to taking this radical action because a promise made before the elections was not fulfilled.\n\n\u201cBefore the May general elections we had resolved that all our four wards [15, 17, 19 and 20] would not participate in the elections. That drew the attention of provincial leadership of the ANC. [Tikana] Weziwe, [MEC for transport, safety and liaison] came here and made a commitment that the road would be constructed by last month, but that did not materialise.\n\n\u201cWe can see that they are playing games with us. Now everyone is desperately calling us day and night saying that school children are supposed to write exams and that we must stop what we are doing.\n\n\u201cBut we know that after the exams they are going to disappear and forget about us, just like they did after the elections,\u201d said Gwaji.\n\nRead: No easy solutions: Learners on farm schools are society\u2019s \u2018most vulnerable\u2019\n\nAt AmaMpondomise village last Wednesday community members were burning tyres and blocking motorists from passing through while they chanted struggle songs.\n\nGwaji said Weziwe told them before the elections that her department had been allocated R300 million for the construction of the road.\n\n\u201cBut before the end of last month officials from her department came and informed us that Treasury had not yet approved the money. This shocked us because at our meeting with the MEC in May she said Treasury had approved the money,\u201d said Gwaji.\n\nHe said they wanted Weziwe to explain to them why the road had not been constructed as per her promises before elections.\n\nUnathi Binqose, Weziwe\u2019s spokesperson, confirmed that a commitment was made for the construction of the road.\n\n\u201cWe encountered some delays due to internal processes. We have committed that we would instead start next month due to these delays and that is only a few weeks from now. But the town is burning, which we do not understand,\u201d said Binqose.", "description": "As many as 16 162 pupils from Grade 1 to Grade 12 in some parts of the Eastern Cape have not been able to attend school since the beginning of this month due to a protracted protest over a road.", "authors": ["Lubabalo Ngcukana"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9348/e9fcedc669d04daeb54e80f629452b71.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
