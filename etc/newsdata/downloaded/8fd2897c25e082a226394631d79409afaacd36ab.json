The EU has always maintained it is willing to drop the backstop if the U.K. can offer an acceptable alternative.\n\nThe pound rose as high as $1.2455 from $1.2331 on Thursday -- the top level since the second day of Johnson's premiership.\n\nWith sterling strong, the FTSE 100 was nearly flat, rising 0.06% to 7348.99.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 13, 2019 05:36 ET (09:36 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
