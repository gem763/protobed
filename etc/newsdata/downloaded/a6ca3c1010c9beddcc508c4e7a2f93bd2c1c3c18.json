A response centered on the so-called \u201cGIUK Gap\u201d \u201crisks misprioritizing future investments.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past few years, Russian submarine activities have become a focal point for U.S. and NATO planners, part of the larger discourse on Russia\u2019s revanchist role in the wake of its illegal annexation of Crimea,\u201d Metrick wrote.\n\n\u201cSeveral military leaders have observed that Russian activities in the undersea domain have reached the highest levels seen in 20 years, and this heightened pace of operations has set off alarm bells from the United Kingdom to Finland and spurred comparisons to the Cold War.\u201d\n\nDuring the Cold War, Soviet submarines needed to pass the GIUK Gap in order to reach the open ocean and close within striking range of NATO ports and ships. That\u2019s not the case with newer Russian subs with their longer-range weapons.\n\n\u201cRussian submarines no longer have to transit the gap to have a dramatic impact on the European military balance,\u201d Metrick wrote. \u201cRather, they can operate from the relative safety of bastions in the Norwegian and Barents seas and strike targets across Northern and Central Europe.\u201d\n\nAssuming budgets remain at their current level, in the 2020s the Russian submarine fleet could include up to 10 Yasen-class guided-missile submarines plus upgraded Kilo, Akula, Oscar and Sierra attack submarines, for a grand total of probably around 50 vessels.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "How should NATO respond?
