The most pointed criticism \u2014 lobbed most aggressively by Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar \u2014 was aimed at her health care plan.\n\nWarren is a proponent of Medicare for All, a position she shares with her chief progressive competitor in the race, Bernie Sanders, who famously \"wrote the damn bill.\" Medicare for All is a sweeping restructuring of the health care system that would create a single, government-run plan covering the medical needs of all Americans. The proposal has become a key part of the platform promoted by a wave of young progressive Democrats such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nOther candidates in the Democratic primary support plans that would create a less-sweeping version of government-run health care, such as a public option or systems to allow people to choose between Medicare and private insurance.\n\nMedicare for All is reminiscent of state-run health care systems found in most European countries, although it is in some ways more generous than those plans because it covers vision, dental and prescription drugs.\n\nWhy there's debate:\n\nFor critics on the right, Medicare for All is the embodiment of Democratic overreach and big-government spending. But the idea also faces criticism from Democrats, despite broad agreement within the party that significant change is needed in the health care system.\n\nCritiques commonly focus on two perceived problems with the plan: cost and political feasibility. If enacted, Medicare for All would cost an estimated $32 trillion over a 10-year span, according to a recent study.\n\nModerate Democrats question whether voters would be turned off by a plan that includes tax increases and would force 150 million people with employer-provided plans to change their coverage. There is also skepticism that the proposal would have any chance of making it through Congress, even in the most optimistic 2020 scenarios for Democrats. Klobuchar called the plan a \"pipe dream.\"\n\nSanders and Warren defend Medicare for All, citing studies that predict total health care costs would actually go down, both for the country and for most Americans. The extra money in taxes the average citizen pays would be less than they pay in health care costs under the current system. Medicare for All would also eliminate the risk of unexpected medical expenses that lead to 500,000 bankruptcies a year, Sanders said.\n\nOthers argue that the bold plan provides room for compromise if concessions are needed to get enough votes in Congress. Even if parts of the proposal are lost through political maneuvering, a bill that gets through would still be a major reform of the health care system.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nWith Warren and Sanders toward the front of the pack in the Democratic race, Medicare for All will likely be a major point of debate throughout the primaries. Support for the idea has dipped slightly in recent months, although it is still quite popular among Democrats, according to a recent survey. Regardless of who wins the nomination, and what their plan is, health care is projected to be a winning issue for Democrats in the general election. Trust in the president's ability to deliver on the issue is low, polling suggests.\n\nPerspectives:\n\nThe plan is feasible\n\nMedicare for All would be cheaper than the current system\n\n\"We pay more now than we would under Medicare for All. Not only can we afford it, we can't afford anything else. Our current system is unsustainable.' \u2014 Marcia Angell, USA Today\n\nA bold proposal serves as a strong starting point for negotiations\n\n\"To transform what\u2019s wrong, and achieve conditions in which people are no longer suffering and dying, we cannot bargain against ourselves. We have to come to the table with the strongest possible legislation \u2014 not a half measure.\" \u2014 National Nurses United executive director Bonnie Castillo, The Hill\n\nIt's worth advocating for the idea, even if it's unlikely to be achieved in the near future\n\n\"Debating it now doesn't do nothing. Politicians like Sanders and Warren may recognize that even if their policies don't pass in their respective (hypothetical) presidencies, talking about the policy now could lay the groundwork for Medicare for All in the future.\" \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben, NPR", "description": "To critics, Medicare for All is the embodiment of overreach and big-government spending.
