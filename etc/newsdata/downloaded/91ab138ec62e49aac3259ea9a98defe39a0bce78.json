At the time, Valve chalked this up to \u201ca bug\u201d which it said it corrected, but smaller developers complain that Steam\u2019s recommendations have continued to let them down ever since. Now Valve says it\u2019s changed recommendation sections to de-prioritise bigger games and focus more on personalised selections for individual users.\n\nValve began its announcement post by admitting that recommendations had some issues. \u201cPreviously, when customers would look for games by browsing the recommendation feed at the bottom of the homepage or the \u2018More Like This\u2019 sections, they weren\u2019t seeing as many different games as we would\u2019ve liked,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cFurthermore, we were receiving lots of feedback that \u2018Recommended for You\u2019 felt too biased towards only the most popular games and didn\u2019t feel very personalised.\u201d\n\nSo Valve went on a bug hunt.\n\n\u201cWe found some bugs, such as the \u2018Similar by Tags\u2019 section of the Recommendation Feed, which had a bug that top-rated games (a category that doesn\u2019t change very often) were driving too much of what players saw,\u201d Valve wrote. \u201cWe changed that. We also found that in some places our timescale used to calculate popularity was too narrow, resulting in unpredictable visibility for some games. So we expanded the time period we use in those calculations.\u201d\n\nThese changes should now be available to all Steam users. Valve tested them on a small segment of users prior to launch and found that the fixes resulted in users clicking on recommended games more often and visiting the pages of a greater number of individual games.\n\n\u201cIn these changes, \u2018Recommended for You\u2019 became less biased towards popular games, and showed games that are more relevant to individual customers,\u201d Valve wrote of the algorithm test. \u201cAs it turned out, customers in the experiment group were more likely to click on the games shown in the recommendations section, at a rate almost 15 per cent higher than the control group. The increased personalisation means there is an even greater variety of games being shown in this section, and customer impressions are more evenly distributed among them.\u201d\n\nThere was also a 75 per cent increase in the number of unique games visited, and a 48 per cent increase in average visits per game compared to a control group with the prior popular-game-loving, Mountain-Dew-chugging version of the algorithm.\n\nFor years now, Steam has had trouble surfacing smaller games to users who might be interested in them. This has frustrated indie developers, many of whom now see potential success on the platform as a crapshoot even if they generate a fair amount of buzz around their game pre-release.\n\nRecommendations have been an especially big thorn in developers\u2019 sides. Between this algorithmic change and experimental new tools like an AI that scans your playtime and helps you figure out what to buy next, it seems like Valve is finally making a concerted effort to minimise the problem.\n\nValve believes these early results signal a change for the better on Steam.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by these results and have now rolled them out to everyone,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe continue to make changes and run experiments like this in order to improve Steam\u2019s existing features, while we also explore entirely different ways for customers to find games they love.\u201d", "description": "Last October, Steam\u2019s algorithm briefly went haywire, filling users\u2019 \u201cMore Like This\u201d recommendation sections with popular games while negatively affecting under-the-radar indies who needed the exposure.
