So what made them the luxury food that they are today?\n\nOysters have been around for a while. Estimates put the shellfish at around 300 million years old, at least, and humans have been enjoying them for centuries.\n\nOyster cultivation was invented by Sergius Orata, a Roman engineer also often credited with the invention of underfloor heating, and since his invention, oyster farming has become big business. While you may be seeing oysters on the menu more these days, their popularity now is nothing compared to just 200 years ago.\n\nOyster sales boomed from the early 19th century onwards, and the shellfish were sold as street food across London, Paris, and New York as they remained a cheap and accessible snack to many. In 1860, the small British seaside town of Whitstable alone was sending 50 million tons of oysters to London each year, and by 1900, New York was eating 1 million oysters every day.\n\nBut as their popularity grew, so did the problems. Industrialisation and dredging of the waters in England led to overfishing, and as more people moved to the coast, more and more sewage ended up dumped in oyster-growing waters. Soon, there were outbreaks of typhoid and other diseases, and many oyster beds had to be closed.\n\nHard winters and new diseases killed off many of the remaining native oysters and gave the shellfish a bad reputation that lasted for years to come.\n\nThere\u2019s something else that kept the price of oysters down around the turn of the century: child labour. In the early 20th century, American photographer Lewis Hine captured photographs of many of the children working in the oyster industry, even photographing 4-year-old Mary, who had apparently shucked two pots of oysters each day.\n\nThings had to change, though. We soon realised the importance of clean water in the oyster-growing process and outlawed child labour. Making oysters environmentally safe and ethical to grow came at a cost, as the shellfish take a lot of work to produce. And now when oysters are raised, the environment they\u2019re grown in is one of the main considerations.\n\nAndre Hughes, Oyster Farmer: \u201cHere, there\u2019s no industry, there\u2019s very little even farming here. What you\u2019ve got out in the loch is just everything that is natural in the loch, so they\u2019re feeding on the best possible feed that you could want and there couldn\u2019t be an any more natural product.\u201d\n\nEach oyster takes two to three years to mature, and they start out microscopically small. The tiny shellfish are grown in hatcheries. When they\u2019re large enough, they\u2019re transplanted to their final growing place.\n\nHughes: \u201cWell, we get the oysters in from our hatchery when they\u2019re about your thumbnail size. We will grow them in these baskets for approximately two to three years, and then we\u2019ll send them to the depuration centre for depurating, and then for pack and for dispatch.\u201d\n\nAt Loch Fyne, every oyster is depurated, a process that cleans the oysters and removes any dangerous bacteria. Every single oyster must be checked by hand. Making sure that each oyster is shipped live is paramount.\n\nHughes: \u201cBelieve it or not, we sell roughly about 35,000 oysters every week out here, and every single oyster is individually checked. So, what we would do is when we\u2019re packing the oysters, we\u2019d pick up two oysters, and we would tap them together. Now, you can obviously see that one\u2019s dead, but when you\u2019re packing thousands at a time, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily see it, and sometimes it\u2019s only open just a little tiny bit, but when you tap that oyster, you can hear it almost straightaway, and that is the best way to tell if an oyster\u2019s gonna reach its shelf life, whether it should be discarded.\u201d\n\nOysters may only have a nine-day shelf life, but that doesn\u2019t stop them being shipped all across the globe, and their popularity and image as a luxury treat means that their demand is only going to rise.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
