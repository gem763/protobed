He's destroying the democracy. He doesn't know what he's doing. He's writing stupid letters to Erdogan. He's killing people far away from us who did nothing but help us. Give him a chance?

Bush because I knew I would like him,\u201d Behar said. \u201cI knew I would because he seems like a likable kind of guy. But if you lost a child in Iraq then you don't like him so much.\u201d\n\nIn July, Behar\u2019s comments about Trump were apparently too extreme for her co-hosts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Why can\u2019t he be brought up on charges of hate speech?\u201d Behar said on that episode, referring to comments Trump had made about far-left Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. \u201cWhy can\u2019t he be sued by the ACLU for hate speech? I don't get it. How does he get away with this?\"\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner, Whoopi Goldberg and Meghan McCain of \u201cThe View\u201d quickly ended Behar\u2019s rant and moved on.", "description": "Trump-bashing \u201cView\u201d co-host Joy Behar apparently can\u2019t avoid arguing about the president even while on vacation.", "authors": ["Dom Calicchio"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/joy20behar20420ABC.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
