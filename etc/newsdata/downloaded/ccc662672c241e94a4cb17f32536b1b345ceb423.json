Her unforgettable Dart (2002) was about a river, and this electrifying new work \u2013 a single poem with a frightening undertow that reminds one a little of the mood of Coleridge\u2019s Ancient Mariner \u2013 is an encounter with the sea. It is out of this world \u2013 and in it. It is mythical and realistic, ancient and modern and was originally commissioned to accompany a series of watercolours by William Tillyer (it has been rewritten to be a more \u201cmobile\u201d version). In a foreword, Oswald relates the contrasting stories from The Odyssey that inspired it. In one, Agamemnon pays a poet to spy on his wife and the poet is then banished to a stony island which allows for the seduction of the wife (Agamemnon is murdered 10 years later). In the other, Odysseus\u2019s return, after a decade away, is luckier \u2013 his faithful wife is waiting for him. The poem exists, Oswald maintains in a foreword, in the \u201cmurky\u201d region between these outcomes: \u201cIts voice is wind-blown, water-damaged, as if someone set out to sing The Odyssey but was rowed to a stony island and never discovered the poem\u2019s ending.\u201d In Oswald\u2019s hands, the poet on his island is at once trapped and free (is this a fair description of what it is to be a poet?). His thoughts are his escape as he surveys his Mediterranean prison.\n\nThe poem is, in part, an experiment with scale. No human figure can compete with the sea. Throughout literature, poets have tried to get the upper hand with the sea but Oswald understands no single phrase can hope to possess her subject. In any contest between words and sea, the sea will win no matter how elegant, ingenious, devious (and Oswald can be all of these) the writer. She knows it will keep replenishing itself, each breaking wave potentially a new idea. Her \u201cplough but with no harvest\u201d idea is thrillingly accurate but then she moves on. At times, there is an alarming sense of being subsumed into sea, of time helplessly swallowed whole:\n\nand when it rains and the sand has every ounce of me\n\nmarked at low tide and immediately forgotten\n\nso that my footprints far into the future\n\ngo on sunkenly walking underneath me\n\n\n\nFaced with the sea\u2019s vastness, feeling lost is common. And this thought stands alone on a double-page spread:\n\nHow does it start the sea has endless beginnings\n\nAnd there is no stopping the sea, like a Canute of punctuation, with a question mark.\n\nOswald is at the top of her form here \u2013 note the apparent effortlessness of the writing, the casual economy of a phrase like \u201cbreakneck cliffs\u201d. There\u2019s a marvellously comic exactitude at times but it isn\u2019t allowed to undermine the prevailing sobriety. I loved the fond, accurate glimpse of \u201cseals breathing out the sea\u2019s bad breath/snuffle about all afternoon in sleeping bags.\u201d And she writes beautifully about a distrait dawn and then there is the entertaining originality of this image: \u201cand sometimes mist a kind of stupefied rain/slumps over the water like a teenager\u201d. Occasional contemporary references (commuters, subtitles, a briefcase) are lightly judged, the seascape\u2019s anachronistic driftwood.\n\nA prevailing sense of danger in Nobody is, if anything, heightened by the Homeric authority with which Oswald writes about fate (\u201cthat great failure of the will\u201d \u2013 a marvellous phrase). And the last lines of each section thin out to a single word or two, deposited on the shore of the page like a handful of shingle \u2013 one poem even ends with \u201cstones\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Nobody by Alice Oswald is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a310).
