There is the rough shape of the deal to be done.\n\n\"I have been to talk to various other EU leaders, particularly in Germany, in France and in Ireland, where we made a good deal of progress.\n\n\"I'm seeing [Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier] on Monday and we will talk about the ideas that we've been working on and we will see where we get.\"\n\nHe added: \"I would say I'm cautiously optimistic.\"\n\n'Shenanigans'\n\nMPs are still demanding Parliament be recalled to scrutinise a number of Brexit-related issues, including the release of so-called \"Yellowhammer\" papers - a government assessment of a reasonable worst-case scenario in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal.\n\nBut Mr Johnson said that \"whatever the shenanigans that may be going on at Westminster\", the government would \"get on with delivering our agenda and preparing to take this country out of the EU on 31 October\".\n\nHe added that there would still be \"ample time\" for MPs to scrutinise any deal reached with the EU, adding that he \"very much hoped\" to agree one at the EU summit on 17 and 18 October.\n\nThe Times newspaper reported that a Brexit deal could be on the horizon as the Northern Irish Democratic Unionists (DUP) - the party which has a confidence and supply deal with the Conservatives - had reportedly agreed to \"shift its red lines\" over the backstop.\n\nThe backstop is the policy in the existing withdrawal agreement - negotiated between former Prime Minister Theresa May and the EU - aimed at preventing a hard border returning to the island of Ireland, but it has proved controversial with a number of pro-Brexit MPs.\n\nHowever, the reports were rejected by the DUP's leader Arlene Foster, who tweeted: \"Anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories.\"\n\nA UK spokesman in Brussels revealed the negotiating team had \"presented some ideas\" on an all-island Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary solution - essentially keeping Northern Ireland aligned with EU regulations on animal and food health.\n\nBut the DUP has said it would not support any arrangement that could see Northern Ireland treated differently than the rest of the UK after Brexit.", "description": "Boris Johnson says the UK will leave by the deadline, but he is \"cautiously optimistic\" of getting a deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0712/production/_108801810_mediaitem108801806.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
