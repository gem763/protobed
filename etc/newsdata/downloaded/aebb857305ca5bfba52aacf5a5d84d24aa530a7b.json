Be Sure to Read the Fine Print.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nStock brokerage commissions appear to be on the brink of extinction, but investors should be aware of hidden costs and pitfalls that can come with \u201cfree\u201d trading.\n\nThe latest salvos in the race to zero began Tuesday when Charles Schwab said it would eliminate commissions on online trades of stocks, exchange-traded funds and options. Rival discount brokers TD Ameritrade Holding and E*Trade Financial quickly followed suit with matching cuts.\n\nWhile commission-free trades sound nice from a marketing standpoint and are likely to lure investors, financial professionals point investors to the fine print. There are limits to commission-free trades, for instance, and some remaining fees. What\u2019s more, free trading could lead investors to make risky bets or disregard other costs of trading, such as taxes.\n\nHere, Barron\u2019s answers some common investor questions.\n\nWhat commissions are being eliminated?\n\nStarting Oct. 7, Charles Schwab will offer zero commission rates for trading stocks, ETFs and options listed on U.S. and Canadian exchanges. The current charge is $4.95. It will also eliminate commissions on online over-the-counter stock trades, but the standard $50 foreign transaction fee still applies. All domestic retail brokerage accounts other than Schwab One Organization accounts are eligible for the commission-free trading regardless of account size, the company says. (Schwab One accounts are used by businesses, nonprofits, and family offices.)\n\nTD Ameritrade eliminated commissions on online trades of U.S. exchange-listed stock, ETF and options trades beginning this past week. It previously charged $6.95 per trade. No account minimum applies. Its new rates will be effective for its retail clients as well as clients of independent registered investment advisors that use TD Ameritrade Institutional. There will be no limits on commission-free trades, but the standard rules will apply to day-trading on margin, the company says.\n\nE*Trade said it would also eliminate retail commissions for online U.S.-listed stock, ETF and options trades starting Oct. 7. It also plans to cut its options contract charge\u2014a premium buyers pay to sellers\u2014to 65 cents per contract, while maintaining its active-trader pricing at 50 cents per contract.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group said in September that it will begin offering commission-free trades of U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs on a new \u201clite\u201d version of its trading platform, which offers a simplified trading experience for less-active traders. It will be available in this month, the company said. There is no account minimum.\n\nAre there limits or requirements on the number of trades?\n\nAt each firm, the commission-free trades are unlimited, and no inactivity fees will be charged.\n\nDoes this mean trading is free?\n\nTrading won\u2019t be free in all cases. Schwab will still charge a commission for trading foreign stocks and fixed-income investments. Additional fees may apply if a Schwab client wants assistance when trading large blocks of stocks, typically 10,000 shares or more of illiquid securities, the company says.\n\nService charges of $25 and $5, respectively, will still apply for trades placed through a broker or by automated phone. Though Schwab does not generally charge a withdrawal fee, fees may apply if a client wants funds wired out of their account the same day.\n\nSchwab and TD Ameritrade will also continue to levy a 65-cent fee per options contract.\n\nAt TD Ameritrade, a $6.95 commission applies to trades of over-the-counter stocks. IBG also will charge commission on OTC stocks.\n\nIf my brokerage still charges commissions, should I switch to one offering commission-free trades?\n\nIt probably doesn\u2019t pay for investors to switch brokers solely due to commissions. Most online brokerages are likely to offer commission-free trading at some point, analysts say, so it may make sense to wait.\n\n\u201cDeclining per trade commissions have been an industry trend for decades,\u201d wrote Stephen Biggar, director of financial institutions research at Argus Research, \u201cand while the timing and extent of the drop is surprising, we see Schwab\u2019s move as accelerating the inevitable.\u201d\n\nCraig Siegenthaler, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a note that he expects Fidelity Investments to announce cuts to its own commission rates over the short term, likely matching the zero rate.\n\nA spokesman for Fidelity had no comment on whether it would end commissions.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nIn addition, commissions are just part of the bigger picture investors should consider when choosing a brokerage. \u201cIf $5 on every 1,000 trade means a lot to you, then maybe you\u2019d move,\u201d Biggar says, \u201cbut most people are probably with the broker they\u2019re with because they\u2019re happy with the services they receive.\u201d\n\nPeter Crane, president of Crane Data, says investors who consider switching brokerages over a $2 or $4 commission are likely trading too frequently.\n\nWhat are some pitfalls for investors?\n\nCommission-free trading could tempt some investors to trade more frequently, which could prove detrimental to their returns through untimely trades and potentially higher tax bills on short-term holdings.\n\nBrokerages could also offset some of the losses from commissions by increasing charges that are less transparent to investors or dipping into their pockets in other ways. For example, Crane says, consumers may save on commissions but earn less on the cash in their brokerage accounts. Brokerages earn money by borrowing from account holders and lending to others at a higher interest rate, and they could adjust interest paid to help negate free trading.\n\nWhile many brokerage customers need to keep some cash in their accounts, experts say they should keep as little as possible and may want to shop around to see who will pay them the most for cash that\u2019s sitting in their accounts.\n\nThere are other ways for brokerages to recoup their losses. When an investor buys or sells a stock, for example, he usually pays more or receives less than the stock\u2019s prevailing price. That\u2019s because market makers, the trading firms that handle the trades, are compensated. This difference is known as the bid/ask spread. To make up for revenue lost from commissions, brokerages could route trades in a way that leads to wider spreads.\n\nUltimately, Crane says, consumers are going to pay one way or another.\n\nQuestions?
