I'm confused,\" replied Jim Cramer to one caller who asked about Spotify Technology (SPOT) during the Lightning Round of his Mad Money program Monday night. Let's check out the charts and indicators of this digital music, podcast and streaming service to see what they may reveal.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of SPOT, below, we can see a broad sideways trading range for this stock the past 12 months. Prices has crossed above the below the 50-day moving average line while the slope of the 200-day moving average line has been negative for most of this year. The 200-day line looks like it is beginning to bottom out. The 50-day line just crossed below the slower-to-react 200-day line for what is commonly called a bearish death or dead cross.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a pattern of higher lows from late December so we could say that the volume trends were bullish. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is crossing to the upside from below the zero line for a cover shorts buy signal -- a buy signal in a downtrend.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of SPOT, below, we can see a large decline last year as prices plunged from around $200 to around $100 or a 50% correction. Prices bounced up into July but came back down to make what might become a double-bottom pattern.\n\nPrices are below the 40-week moving average line and the weekly OBV line has been bearish for more than a year. The MACD oscillator is bearish on this time frame and it has yet to narrow.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of SPOT, below, we can see a possible upside price target of $131. A trade at $109.77 would be bearish.\n\nBottom-line strategy: SPOT could make a bounce to the upside but I would not put high odds on it happening. The current market environment is not one that can lift all boats.", "description": "Technical analysis and trading strategy on Spotify stock....SPOT", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Spotify Stock", "Will We See Spot Run", "Let'S Check The Charts", "Indicators Of This Digital Music", "Podcast", "Streaming Service.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/044ceb9a-373e-11e8-96fb-ad3cb96782b4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
