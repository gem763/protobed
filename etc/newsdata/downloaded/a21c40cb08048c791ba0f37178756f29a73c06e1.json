Tulsi Gabbard Tulsi Gabbard2020 Presidential Candidates The Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Presented by USAA \u2014 House Dems subpoena Giuliani associates Gabbard says she may boycott next week's debate MORE (D-Hawaii) on Friday doubled down on her threats to boycott next week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, stating that the Democratic National Committee\u2019s criteria for making the stage poses a \u201cvery serious threat to our democracy.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic presidential hopeful ripped the DNC\u2019s \u201cpseudo-polls\u201d and \u201carbitrary requirements,\u201d accusing the committee of \u201ctrying hold their own primary election before the primary election even begins.\u201d\n\nGabbard, who is well behind the contest's frontrunners in the polls, said she's thinking about skipping Tuesday's debate because she thinks the rules have taken power away from voters.\n\n\u201cThe DNC and their corporate media partners are essentially trying to hijack this election process away from the responsibility that voters have,\u201d she said.\n\nThe DNC didn't immediately respond to Hill.TV's request for comment.\n\nGabbard first announced that she might skip the Ohio debate on Thursday. She said she would make a decision in the coming days.\n\nThe DNC has defended its handling of the debates, saying it announced the qualification for the September and October debates in May, giving candidates plenty of time to qualify. A DNC official also argued in response to Gabbard\u2019s previous criticism of the debates that it would be \u201cdisservice\u201d to the party as a whole not to give front-runners enough time on the debate stage.\n\nGabbard missed the September debate but did meet the criteria for Tuesday's contest. Candidates had to get contributions from 130,000 unique donors and register at least 2 percent in four approval polls to qualify for Tuesday's debate. Twelve Democrats made the criteria, including Gabbard.\n\nThe debate in November raises the thresholds to 165,000 unique donors and 3 percent in four approved polls. Only eight candidates have qualified under those thresholds.\n\nIn her interview with Hill.TV, Gabbard said she is still weighing the decision on whether to boycott Tuesday's debate \u201cvery carefully,\u201d noting that she has not heard directly from the DNC about her possible boycott.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m listening to a lot of the feedback that we\u2019re getting from supporters and just thinking through all of the ramifications of this decision,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat it really comes down to is how best to make an impact to bring about this change.\u201d\n\nThe Hawaii Democrat has long been critical of the DNC\u2019s debate criteria, questioning the committee over its transparency and fairness.\n\n\u2014Tess Bonn", "description": "Rep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gabbardtulsi_073118upi_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
