Mitt Romney says President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to abandon Kurdish allies in Syria \u201cwill stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d\n\nThe Utah senator took to the Senate floor Thursday to criticize Trump anew over his withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\nThat pullback resulted in Turkey\u2019s invasion of the area so it could attack Syrian Kurds, a pivotal U.S. ally against Islamic State fighters.\n\nRomney says removing U.S. troops who protected the Kurds \u201cviolates one of our most sacred duties. It strikes at American honor.\u201d\n\nRomney says he hopes a five-day cease-fire announced Thursday works. But he says a deal with Turkey should have been struck before the U.S. pulled its troops out, not afterward.\n\n___\n\n1 a.m.\n\nCongress\u2019 two top Democrats are bashing the five-day ceasefire in Syria that the U.S. has brokered with Turkey.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer say the agreement is a \u201csham\u201d that shows President Donald Trump is \u201cflailing.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats say Turkey has surrendered nothing while Trump has given Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u201ceverything.\u201d\n\nThey say the deal damages American credibility and leaves thousands of Islamic State prisoners in the hands of Turkey and Syria\u2019s government. They say that represents a security threat to the U.S.\n\nPelosi and Schumer say the U.S. and its allies \u201cdeserve smart, strong and sane leadership from Washington.\u201d\n\nTurkey invaded northern Syria last week and has been attacking Syrian Kurds, a key U.S. ally against the Islamic State.\n\n___\n\n9:30 p.m. Thursday\n\nPresident Donald Trump is crediting his threat of sanctions on Turkey as \u201ctough love\u201d that led the country to agree to a five-day cease-fire in its battle with Kurds in northern Syria.\n\nTalking to reporters in Fort Worth, Texas, on Thursday, Trump said the Kurds are happy with the deal.\n\nBut the president\u2019s critics say he put the Kurdish forces in danger by announcing a U.S. troop withdrawal.\n\nThey say the deal, announced in Turkey by Vice President Mike Pence, essentially gives Turkey what it wanted to achieve from its incursion into Syria in the first place. After the Kurds move from the area, Turkey has committed to a permanent cease-fire but is under no obligation to withdraw its troops.\n\nTrump says he\u2019s open to hosting the Turkish leader in Washington.\n\n___\n\n8:50 p.m.\n\nVice President Mike Pence says that Turkey has agreed to a cease-fire in Syria.\n\nPence spoke after a high-level delegation of U.S. officials met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (REH\u2019-jehp TY\u2019-ihp UR\u2019-doh-wahn) in Ankara, Turkey.\n\nPence says there will \u201ca pause in military operations for 120 hours\u201d to allow the U.S.-allied Syrian Kurds to withdraw.\n\nThe vice president says the U.S. and Turkey have \u201cmutually committed to peaceful resolution and future for the safe zone.\u201d\n\n___\n\n8:25 p.m.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s top Democrat is pushing for quick approval of a resolution opposing President Donald Trump\u2019s troop withdrawal from Syria, but a Republican is blocking the move.\n\nNew York Sen. Chuck Schumer says the most important step lawmakers can take is to send Trump a message that Congress is rejecting his foreign policy approach.\n\nThe House on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed the resolution, which pushes the administration to put forward a Syria plan. Lawmakers are outraged over the withdrawal that\u2019s paved the way for a Turkish attack on Syrian Kurds, U.S. allies in the long-running war.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calls Trump\u2019s action a \u201cmistake\u201d and he\u2019s fast-tracked the resolution for consideration.\n\nSchumer was trying to approve the measure immediately. But Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky objected.\n\n___\n\n7:40 p.m.\n\nVice President Mike Pence meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (REH\u2019-jehp TY\u2019-ihp UR\u2019-doh-wahn) stretched to more than four hours Thursday, as he pressed the NATO ally to agree to a cease-fire in Northern Syria.\n\nPence\u2019s office said talks between the U.S. and Turkish delegations were continuing inside Turkey\u2019s presidency complex more than two hours past their scheduled conclusion. It was not immediately clear if there was any movement toward a cease-fire or other developments from the discussions.\n\nPence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House are to hold a press conference when the meetings wrap up.\n\n__\n\n3:56 p.m.\n\nA senior U.S. delegation arrived Thursday for meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (REH\u2019-jehp TY\u2019-ihp UR\u2019-doh-wahn) on an improbable mission to push for a cease-fire in Northern Syria.\n\nArmored SUVs carrying Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien entered the vast Turkish presidency complex in Ankara to meet with Erdogan.\n\nThe White House says Pence was greeted by his Turkish counterpart before entering a one-on-one meeting with Erdogan. U.S. special envoy for Syria Amb. James Jeffrey served as the American translator. A second meeting with the full delegations was to take place later Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe U.S. officials are expected to warn Erdogan that he will face additional economic sanctions if he doesn\u2019t halt his assault on Kurdish forces once allied with the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\n__\n\n1:20 p.m.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (pahm-PAY\u2019-oh) have arrived in Turkey to mount an improbable push for a cease-fire in Syria.\n\nTheir visit to Ankara on Thursday to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (REH\u2019-jehp TY\u2019-ihp UR\u2019-doh-wahn) comes a day after President Donald Trump suggested the U.S. has no stake in defending Kurdish fighters once allied against the Islamic State group.\n\nThe high-level U.S. delegation is to warn Erdogan that Washington will escalate economic sanctions if his assault on Kurdish fighters continues. But the Turkish leader has said he would only agree to a cease-fire if Kurdish forces abandon key positions in Syria.\n\nU.S. officials acknowledge the odds are slim for an immediate halt to the weeklong conflict. The visit comes as Trump faces bipartisan condemnation in Washington for withdrawing American troops from northern Syria, which paved the way for the Turkish incursion.\n\n___\n\n8:55 a.m.\n\nA senior U.S. delegation on its way to Turkey is facing a herculean task \u2014 to pressure Turkish officials to accept a cease-fire in Northern Syria just hours after President Donald Trump declared the U.S. has no stake in defending its Kurdish allies.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is heading a U.S. delegation that includes Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien. They are set to arrive in Turkey Thursday afternoon, a day after Trump dismissed the very crisis he sent his aides on an emergency mission to douse.\n\nTrump suggested Wednesday that a Kurdish group was a greater terror threat than Islamic State militants. He also welcomed the efforts of Russia and the Assad government to fill the void left by the U.S. withdrawal.", "description": "ANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 The Latest on developments in Syria (all times local): 1:30 a.m. Friday Republican Sen.
