but thanks to protestations from Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan the girls made it through to the next stage.\n\nHarmony had a good run, reaching the live semi-finals until they lost the public vote with a sugary sweet rendition of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\n\nGirlband Lola\n\n(Image: Youtube)\n\nAfter facing early rejection, Megan dusted herself off and got back to the music joining TOWIE star Jessica Wright and pals Amba-Hollie Wood and Lauren Lindsey to form girlband Lola.\n\nDespite their unusual name standing for Loveable, Outrageous, Loud and Ambitious, the group soon disbanded following limited success.\n\nX Factor\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nReturning to reality TV, Megan auditioned for the X Factor in 2013, the year Sam Bailey ended up taking home the winning prize.\n\nAlthough Megan's journey was cut brutally short at boot camp, she auditioned again the following year in 2014, but sadly didn't make it as far.\n\nCelebrity Big Brother\n\n(Image: Channel 5)\n\nDespite temporarily disappearing from the spotlight, Megan continued to crop up on TV screens with appearances on Ibiza Weekender, Ex On The Beach and then Celebrity Big Brother .\n\nDuring the January 2016 series of CBB, Megan impressed housemates with a blistering performance of epic power ballad Angel, by Sarah McLachlan - memorably leaving Darren Day on the verge of tears.\n\nIt was through her fiery CBB appearance that Megan cemented her fame and met TOWIE hunk Pete Wicks, who she went on to join on his show.\n\nThe Only Way Is Essex\n\nAfter landing a permanent spot on the ITV2 docu-soap, it wasn't long before Megan was busting out her vocal talents once again.\n\nJust nine months after joining, Megan performed Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas during the festive special.\n\nBoyfriend Pete looked on proudly as the rest of her cast mates cheered in appreciation, with Chloe Simms uttering she didn't know Megan could sing.\n\nAfter impressing with her vocal ability on the show, Megan landed a place in Strictly Come Dancing star Kristina Rihanoff 's West End Production One More Dance.\n\nThe two ladies had become friends after meeting on CBB earlier in the year.\n\nSpeaking at the time , Megan described her stage debut as a 'dream come true,' but the best was yet to come.\n\nThere's Something About Megan\n\n(Image: ITV Picture Desk)\n\n(Image: ITV Picture Desk)\n\nMegan Mckenna surprised everybody, not least herself, when her debut single High Heeled Shoes rocketed up the charts and shoved Taylor Swift off the number one spot just hours after its release in 2017.\n\nThe reality star left established artists like P!nk, Katy Perry and Miss Swift's mega comeback Look What You Made Me Do trailing in her wake with her Country bop.\n\nWhen Megan first announced plans to jet off to Nashville and make it country singer, she faced a barrage of criticism.\n\nNaturally, she invited cameras along to film her efforts as part of TV show, There's Something About Megan.\n\nBut the determined star silenced her haters once and for all when she released her debut single to see it soar to the top of the charts within hours.\n\nWhen she heard the incredible news, an emotional Megan rushed to Twitter to thank her loyal fan base.\n\n\"Guysssss I'm overwhelmed!!!!!! I am seeing all your lovely messages trust me! Thankyou [sic]\" she wrote.\n\nX Factor: Celebrity\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAfter Megan has taken two years out of the spotlight, Celebrity PR expert Rob Cooper told Mirror Online he believes X Factor: Celebrity is the perfect opportunity for her to come back fighting.\n\nHe said: \"Unlike many of the contestants, Megan has proved that music is the real passion in her life, even before becoming a reality star.\n\n\"Back in 2009 Megan auditioned on Britain's Got Talent, and although the attempt didn\u2019t secure her a place in the live finals, it\u2019s now validated her claims that music is a real passion of hers.\n\n\"It's important that viewers believe that music is serious to a contestant, as social media fans have been given more of an insight into celebrities lives and interests, if people don\u2019t believe singing is a passion then it\u2019s less likely they will get behind her in the same way.\n\n(Image: Beretta/Sims/REX)\n\n\"The other slight benefit for Megan is that she has the perfect balance of two different audiences : Online and mainstream. Not only will the viewers know who she is because of her 2.3million Instagram followers, but also because they follow her life via reality TV, tabloids, magazines and TV interviews.\n\n\"I genuinely believe this is the perfect time for Megan to reinvent herself from an outspoken reality star to a credible recording artist.\n\n\"Numerous people from \u2018The Only Way Is Essex\u2019 have tried to launch successful music careers and failed, I think Megan could break the person to the mould.\"\n\nRob then gave some advice for pop star hopeful Megan.\n\n\"Ove the years she's participated in numerous reality shows such as Towie, Ex On The Beach, Big Brother, Celebs go dating and many more.\n\n\"If she wants to be taken seriously she needs to try and reject anymore reality shows and give music a real bash. People need to believe that Megan wants to be a singer, not a reality star with a singing job on the side.\"\n\nCould X Factor be her chance to finally crack the industry?\n\nFind out tonight on ITV at 8:30pm", "description": "Exclusive: Reality veteran Megan McKenna has spent a decade trying to fulfil her pop dreams and celebrity PR expert Rob Cooper says X Factor: Celebrity is her best chance of making it yet", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Itv", "Youtube", "Instagram", "Channel", "Itv Picture Desk", "Pa", "Beretta Sims Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11127005.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Megan-Mckenna-in-Harmony-on-Britains-Got-Talent-2009.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
