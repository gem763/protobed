All said no.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is withholding the complaint from Congress.\n\n\"This is a really big deal,\" said one former top lawyer at the CIA and NSA. \"They must have known that withholding this complaint would eventually attract attention from the public, and they did it anyway. That suggests that what they're worried about in the complaint is far worse.\"\n\nThe unprecedented nature of the situation prompted a former CIA official to tell Insider it's \"equivalent to an imminent threat in the [intelligence community]. DEFCON 1.\"\n\n\"To be in this line of work and then to file a formal complaint against the sitting president and the commander in chief based on something he said \u2014 something that was so deeply alarming \u2014 that's an impossible situation to be in,\" one FBI agent who works in counterintelligence told Insider.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nRecent revelations from the Washington Post about the contents of a whistleblower complaint filed within the intelligence community have rocked Washington and thrust the country into uncharted territory.\n\nThe Post reported that part of the complaint involves President Donald Trump's communication with a foreign leader and a \"promise\" Trump made during a phone call with that person. It's unclear who the leader is or what the substance of the conversation was. The New York Times later reported that the complaint covers multiple acts by Trump that go beyond any single discussion with a foreign leader.\n\nInsider asked half a dozen current and former officials across different intelligence agencies if they were aware of any other case in which someone within the intelligence community blew the whistle on the president. All of them said no.\n\n\"I can't think of any other scenario like this,\" James Baker, the former general counsel of the FBI, told Insider. He cautioned that many details about the complaint are still unknown, but added: \"Having said that, I would take this matter very seriously.\"\n\nAccording to House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, the whistleblower filed the complaint with the Intelligence Community inspector general (IC IG) on August 12. The IC IG reviewed the information and found that the complaint was credible and a matter of \"urgent concern,\" and conveyed that finding to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).\n\nBut instead of forwarding the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees \u2014 as is mandated by federal law \u2014 the acting director of national intelligence (DNI), Joseph Maguire, consulted the Justice Department and determined he was not required to turn over the complaint to Congress because it involved conduct by someone outside the intelligence community and involves \"confidential and potentially privileged communications.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday.\n\nRead more: Russia hacked the FBI to prevent the bureau from being able to track Russian spies in the US\n\nRobert Deitz, a former top lawyer at the CIA and National Security Agency, told Insider he doesn't think the ODNI's rationale holds much water \u2014 in part because the commander in chief leads the intelligence community.\n\nHe added that it's more likely Maguire's refusal to turn over the complaint is rooted in fear of political blowback.\n\n\"I can't think of any lawful ground for doing what he's doing,\" Deitz said. \"They must have known that withholding this complaint would eventually attract attention from the public, and they did it anyway. That suggests that what they're worried about in the complaint is far worse.\"\n\n\"This is a really big deal,\" Deitz added. \"And for the IC IG to determine that this is credible and urgent, that's a horse of a different color. That assessment matters.\"\n\nThe unprecedented nature of the situation, moreover, prompted one former CIA official to tell Insider it's \"equivalent to an imminent threat in the [intelligence community].\"\n\n\"DEFCON 1,\" the former official added.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tours a section of the southern border wall, Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2019, in Otay Mesa, Calif.
