He's not good enough,\" said Carragher.\n\n\"If he's that good, he's got a year to go in his contract, you'd pay money for him. People keep saying maybe on a free transfer... you'd have anyone on a free transfer.\n\n\"This summer he wanted to go, he made it known, he said it publicly, and no one came in for him.\n\n\"I think Eriksen has been fantastic for Spurs but he's not better than Spurs. He might go to PSG, he might go to another club, but he won't make any of them better.\"\n\nHis fellow pundit Gary Neville, however, was not of the same opinion, and argued that his former side Manchester United would take Eriksen.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"I think he could play in the top clubs, because he'd be around really good players,\" Neville added. \"He's proved he's a top player and he works hard. This is not a reflection of what we've seen for four years.\n\n\"I think United would pay (for Eriksen). United are struggling to get players in for less than \u00a350m or \u00a360m and I think they'd pay that for him.\"", "description": "The want-away Tottenham midfielder was ineffective in his side's 2-1 defeat to Liverpool amid reports linking him with a move to the Spanish giants", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Peter Powell Epa-Efe Rex", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20739834.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Liverpool-FC-v-Tottenham-Hotspur-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
