(AP) - Kirk Triplett shot a 4-under 66 in windy conditions Friday to take a one-shot lead in the opening round of the Sanford International.\n\nTriplett, a winner in March at the Hoag Classic for his seventh PGA Tour Champions title, entered 10th in the Charles Schwab Cup money standings.\n\nPaul Broadhurst and Tom Gillis shot 67 on a day when a dozen players in the 78-man field broke par at Minnehaha Country Club. Woody Austin was alone in fourth after a 68.\n\nTriplett birdied the 16th and 17th holes to reach 4 under.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s windy, but if you played a practice round on Tuesday, it\u2019s the exact same conditions we had on Tuesday except the course is a touch firmer,\u201d Triplett said. \u201cSome really hard holes, but some other holes are playing easier as well.\u201d\n\nGillis, who is seeking his first win on the over-50 tour, played conservatively because of the conditions.\n\n\u201cI tried not to take any chances really. I just tried to drive it in the fairway,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just too tough to chase pins and try to get the exact numbers. Basically the yardage book, you could throw it out because it was feel, it was all feel. I think the last hole I had like 118 (yards) to the front, I was in the right rough and I just chipped a 7-iron. It went about 70 yards and rolled all the way to the back, to the hole. It was just that kind of day where you had to actually just use some creativity.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kirk Triplett shot a 4-under 66 in windy conditions Friday to take a one-shot lead in the opening round of the Sanford International.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
