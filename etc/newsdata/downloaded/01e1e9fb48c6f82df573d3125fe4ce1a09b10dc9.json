The pair were 16 seconds behind Mollema, who set off on his solo attack on the penultimate climb of the Civiglio, with just over 18 kilometres remaining.\n\n\"I wasn't the favorite so maybe the other riders underestimated me a bit,\" Mollema said. \"I found the right moment to attack. I just went full gas in the last 10 kilometers. It's unreal.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old Mollema won a stage of the Tour de France in 2017.", "description": "Dutch cyclist Bauke Mollema produced a solo ride to victory at the end of the Tour of Lombardy on Saturday to claim one of the most important wins of his career.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cycling/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212828339-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq900leoZVuq6ru6F43OqP_jlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
