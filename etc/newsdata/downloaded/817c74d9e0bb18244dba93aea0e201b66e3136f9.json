Abduli's mom, Semeni, brought him to the healer because he is very lethargic and can't hold his head up. Mwanahija Mzee believes that the baby is possessed by supernatural sprits like djinns. However hospital doctors say he has an incurable brain issue. There are an estimated 2,000 more healers, or mgangas, hoping to register, said Hassan Combo, the government registrar at the council that records them. Traditional healer Bi Mwanahija Mzee has already registered. She tends to patients at her busy clinic where women line up in the early morning sun cradling their sick children.\n\nNadra took her eight-month-old child Muhammad Ali to Mwanahija Mzee to seek relief for him suffering from an umbilical hernia. One family seeks relief for a child suffering from an umbilical hernia, scared that if they bring the child to hospital for surgery he will die. A pregnant woman who has repeatedly miscarried comes for reassurance, herbs and prayers that this baby will survive. \u201cPeople come here because I actually help them. I met many patients that went to hospital first and got no help or the medicine didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Mwanahija Mzee, 56.\n\nMwanahija Mzee prays in her bedroom. \u201cThis is my job six days a week for more than 20 years so I do better, know more than them. Patients that come to me don\u2019t die.\" Mwanahija Mzee's parents were also traditional healers in Zanzibar, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean.\n\nTraditional healer, Sahihi Mrisho, 67, grows and forages most of the medicines he uses in his practice and was trained by his parents who were both healers. To be registered, mgangas must be aged at least 18, have at least three years of experience and have a recommendation letter from a trained mganga. A council of 11 members that can include birth attendants, respected healers, village elders and lawyers approve the applications each month. While the government does not try to dictate healers' methods, it tries to work with them on quality control, government registrar Combo said, for example ensuring plants used in medicines are of the same standard.\n\nA sheik tries to rouse a woman who believes she is possessed by supernatural spirits like djinns, by pouring water on her neck. A group facilitated by the registrars office links doctors with traditional healers to give them some medical education on specific diseases like hypertension, diabetes and pregnancy.

Mwanahija Mzee uses a mix of massages, medicines from roots, herbs and leaves and Koranic verses, which may be written on a plate in red food colouring. The plate is then rinsed, and the water ingested as part of the medicinal regimen.\n\nRoots and herbs sit on a table waiting to be cut into smaller pieces to be given as medicine to patients at Mwanahija Mzee's clinic. Some patients like Fatma Hamad say they trust traditional healers over the overcrowded, underfunded public hospitals where many feel their ailments are not treated properly.\n\nHaji Hafidh poses for a photograph. Fatawi Haji Hafidh, manager at Makunduchi Hospital, the second-largest government-run hospital on Zanzibar's main island, says overstretched doctors and nurses may not have the time to see patients or the diagnostic equipment. Patients may also be unable to afford the medicine prescribed, or they may stop taking it before the course is finished, leading them to relapse and adding to their suspicion of government-run facilities, he said. Many simply believe djinns are the problem.\n\nHamad holds her two-year-old daughter, Khadija, at Mnazi Mmoja government hospital. Fatma Hamad took her 2-year-old daughter to hospital after one of the toddler's legs became paralysed during a high fever. Unable to find the problem through X-rays, the hospital recommended she seek out a traditional healer. Mwanahija Mzee massages the child and after a few appointments, her mobility is slowly improving.

This is Maryam's fifth pregnancy after three miscarriages and one was stillborn. Both she and the healer believe the reason is because children were possessed by supernatural sprits like djinns in the uterus. Maryam comes for reassurance, herbs and prayers that this baby will survive. Hidaya Rayabu, 22, looks at her infant daughter hours after giving birth at Makunduchi Hospital. Hidaya Rayabu, 22, laughs with her husband, Mohammed, who holds their six-day-old daughter Jamillah.
