Trump won just 8 percent of the black vote in 2016 and there are few indications that he has turned the tide since.\n\nHere is a look at the criminal justice platforms for the leading Democrats in the 18-candidate field, as well as Trump's record during his first term in office.\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump\n\nThe Republican president signed into law the First Step Act, which reduced mandatory minimum sentences, required officials to try to place inmates in prisons near family, expanded drug treatment programs for prisoners and parolees, and allowed some federal prisoners to finish their sentences early with good behavior.\n\nThe measure expanded a 2010 law that reduced higher penalties for possession of crack cocaine, used more by the poor and minorities, than for powder cocaine, used more by the wealthy and middle class. It also expanded programs to help at-risk youth and banned the use of restraints for prisoners who are pregnant or post-partum.\n\nUsing an argument that he also made when he ran for president in 2016, Trump said on Friday that generations of Democratic policies had failed minority communities.\n\n\"We've had so many people with empty political rhetoric. We're doing the opposite. We're acting, not talking,\" he said.\n\nAccording to McClatchy DC, only 10 students from the school were given tickets to Trump's speech, with more than half of the 300 seats reserved for guests of his administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Biden\n\nBiden, who served as vice president under former U.S. President Barack Obama, has proposed eliminating prison sentences for drug use, decriminalizing marijuana and eliminating sentencing disparities for offenses involving crack cocaine and powder cocaine. He also would eliminate the death penalty. He would end mandatory sentencing that takes discretion away from judges, eliminate private prisons and end the federal system of cash bail, under which defendants who cannot afford to pay must await trial in jail.\n\nBiden also has pledged to reform the juvenile justice system, including keeping youths from being incarcerated with adults. He would end incarceration for children who drink or engage in other behaviors that would be legal if they were older, such as truancy or curfew violations. He would work to eliminate barriers for felons re-entering society from prison, including restrictions on allowing them to receive food stamps, educational Pell grants and housing support.\n\n\n\n\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nWarren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, says the criminal justice system is harshly punitive, locks up too many people and is stacked against the poor and disadvantaged, as well as against African-Americans and Latinos.\n\nShe has called for increasing social services that help young people stay out of prison, decriminalizing truancy and relying on counselors and teachers rather than police officers in schools. Warren has vowed to push to repeal the 1994 crime bill, which imposed harsh sentences on major and minor crimes alike and removed much of the discretion judges have in deciding who should be incarcerated and for how long.\n\nShe would legalize marijuana at the federal level and erase past convictions for the drug. Like several other Democrats, she would eliminate the differences in sentencing for powder versus crack cocaine. Warren would eliminate the cash bail system, under which defendants who are affluent enough to afford bail do not have to remain in jail pending their trials.", "description": "The forum, at Benedict College, in Columbia, is aimed at tackling the next steps in reforming the U.S. criminal justice system after Trump last year signed bipartisan legislation that instituted a number of changes, including easing harsh minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.
