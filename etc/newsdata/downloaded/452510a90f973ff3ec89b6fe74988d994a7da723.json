Mr. Yeatts had accused the company of defaming him by placing him on the list, which restricted Biomet employees and agents from doing business with him.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nA district court in January threw out Mr. Yeatts\u2019s lawsuit on legal grounds. By calling him a compliance risk, the company was stating an opinion that couldn\u2019t be proven false, the district court said.\n\nIt was reasonable for Biomet to take a \u201chypersensitive view\u201d of potential compliance risks in light of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigations it had faced, the district court added.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on Wednesday upheld the decision. \u201cEven if there were zero evidence he engaged in criminal conduct, that would not prove false Biomet\u2019s concern that Yeatts posed a compliance risk,\u201d the Seventh Circuit said.\n\nA representative of Biomet and lawyers for Mr. Yeatts didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Yeatts\u2019s lawsuit offered a behind-the-scenes look at a turbulent series of years for Warsaw, Ind.-based Biomet, which merged with Zimmer Holdings Inc. in 2015.\n\nThe dispute centered on a Brazilian distributor, Prosintese, which Biomet terminated in 2008 after learning it had bribed health-care providers to promote Biomet products, according to the Seventh Circuit\u2019s ruling.\n\nSoon after moving to cut ties with Prosintese, Biomet began doing business with another distributor, Bio2, which hired the owner of Prosintese as a consultant, the court said. Mr. Yeatts, who was a business manager for Biomet\u2019s South American operations, continued to communicate with Prosintese\u2019s owner\u2014who was now Bio2\u2019s consultant.\n\nMeanwhile, Biomet came under investigation by U.S. authorities for making improper payments to public health-care providers in Argentina, Brazil and China.\n\nThe company in 2012 agreed to pay more than $22 million to resolve violations of the FCPA in joint settlements with the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The misconduct stretched from roughly 2000 to 2008, authorities said.\n\nAs part of its settlement with the Justice Department, Biomet also agreed to hire an independent monitor to oversee the company\u2019s compliance program for an 18-month period.\n\nBiomet\u2019s respite from legal scrutiny didn\u2019t last long. In 2013, it received an anonymous whistleblower email about the Prosintese owner\u2019s ongoing work for the company, according to the Seventh Circuit ruling.\n\nUnder the terms of the company\u2019s 2012 settlements, Biomet was forced to alert the Justice Department and its compliance monitor to the allegations, which caused prosecutors to launch another investigation, the court said.\n\nBiomet eventually concluded that Mr. Yeatts had continued to market and sell Biomet products in Brazil with the Prosintese owner, despite the prohibition against doing so, it said.\n\nBiomet suspended Mr. Yeatts in April 2014 and terminated him in September 2015. Meanwhile, in response to a recommendation by its monitor, it issued a restricted parties list, which included Mr. Yeatts. A statement included with the list said that the entities on it posed \u201csignificant and unacceptable compliance risks.\u201d The list was sent to employees and business partners in Latin America, the court said.\n\nThe Justice Department finished its second investigation of Biomet in 2017 and concluded that the medical device manufacturer hadn\u2019t complied with its 2012 agreement.\n\nBiomet entered into a second agreement with the department and the SEC in 2017, when it agreed to pay another $30 million in penalties.\n\nWrite to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com", "description": "A federal appeals court in Chicago upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit by a former Biomet executive who the company said posed a risk to its compliance with antibribery laws.", "authors": ["Dylan Tokar"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-115994/social", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
