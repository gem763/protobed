But its message -- about the indifference of the authorities, prompting a young woman to recant her initial statements -- comes through loud and clear.\n\nThe story actually operates on twin tracks, following the case of Marie Adler (\"Booksmart\" star Kaitlyn Dever), then 18, who filed a report in 2008 claiming she was sexually assaulted by an intruder in her home.\n\nThe detectives who interview her, however, don't believe her story. Under pressure, Marie eventually says that she made it up, and must endure the consequences of that until a pair of female detectives (played by Toni Collette and Merritt Wever) begin putting the pieces together, interviewing other women in a seemingly unconnected series of rapes.\n\nRead More", "description": "'Unbelievable' strikes a nerve with timing of Netflix debut, landing amid renewed coverage of the #MeToo movement and fresh reporting about Brett Kavanaugh", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190916092936-unbelievable-netflix-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
