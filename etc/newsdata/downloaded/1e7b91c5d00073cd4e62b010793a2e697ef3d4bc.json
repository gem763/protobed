It was a 16-man (tournament). To see some of the legendary names that fought on that one, and now I\u2019m part of that history. I\u2019ll be remembered as the Rizin lightweight champion of the world. That\u2019s such an awesome honor.\u201d\n\nCase went 4-2 in the UFC earlier in his career, and also fought once in the PFL, but says there\u2019s nowhere else he\u2019d rather be than with the Japanese promotion at this stage in his career.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, Rizin is the best promotion to fight for, hands down,\u201d he stated. \u201cThey\u2019re super fair, they pay everything up front. It\u2019s not like in America where you get half if you fight and half if you win. Your pay is your pay, you just go and perform, put on a good show and they honor and respect that. It\u2019s been great, and I don\u2019t picture myself fighting anywhere else.\u201d\n\nSince losing his final UFC bout to Anthony Rocco Martin in June 2017, Case has been on a tear and heads into the lightweight grand prix riding a five-fight unbeaten streak, which includes back-to-back stoppage wins in Rizin.\n\nNow he\u2019s looking to run through the tournament and raise championship gold as the promotion\u2019s top 155-pounder. But while his goal is ultimately to win the title, he said he\u2019s taking things one step at a time.\n\n\u201cI try not to put it on a pedestal too much,\u201d he said of the tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s always been the same for me, preparation, performance and payday. So that\u2019s all I\u2019m focused on. I\u2019m focused on one opponent and one goal at a time. And if I do that, it\u2019ll play out like it\u2019s supposed to play out.\u201d\n\nCase\u2019s form has coincided with him moving to Las Vegas where he has found new focus and clarity in his career. The move, he says has been a huge catalyst in his improved performances and he can\u2019t wait to continue that trend through the upcoming tournament.\n\nListing the factors that have sparked his improved form, Case said: \u201cMoving to Las Vegas, meeting my girlfriend Emily Whitmire, my perspective on life. I was kinda living half-foot in the door, half-foot out. Is fighting what I\u2019m really want to be doing? Am I going to be able to pay the bills? Now it\u2019s like everything\u2019s good in my life. I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m focused, I\u2019m passionate, I\u2019ve got the fire lit again, and that\u2019s been the difference, man.\u201d", "description": "Johnny \"Hollywood\" Case talks moving to Las Vegas and loving life in Rizin ahead of the Japanese promotion's lightweight grand prix.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Brian Garcia", "Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "George Garcia", "Farah Hannoun", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/off-guard-johnny-case.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
