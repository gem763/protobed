Amos Kipruto of Kenya took bronze.\n\nAs with the other road races, the event started just before midnight to escape the worst of the heat and humidity. Conditions were less brutal than previously, although it was still 29.09 Celsius with 48.6 percent humidity at the start, organizers said.\n\nDesisa, silver medalist in Moscow six years ago, became the first Ethiopian to win the title since Gezahegne Abera in 2001. Since then, the race has been won four times by Kenya, twice by Morocco and once each by Eritrea and Uganda.", "description": "Ethiopia's Desisa wins midnight marathon in sprint finish", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF940OH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
