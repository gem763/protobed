Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.), chairwoman of the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Ross to have his subordinates at NOAA corroborate the president\u2019s claims, according to a New York Times report on Wednesday.\n\nThe Times previously reported that Ross had threatened to fire NOAA staff last Friday after the Birmingham, Alabama, office of the National Weather Service, which is a division of NOAA, tweeted that the state \u201cwill NOT see any impacts\u201d from Dorian. The latter tweet was posted Sept. 1 not long after Trump\u2019s claim about the hurricane\u2019s threat to Alabama.\n\nLater Friday afternoon, NOAA issued an unattributed statement asserting that the Birmingham office misspoke in its tweet contradicting the president.\n\nIn a statement to the Times, a Commerce Department spokesman denied that Ross had threatened to fire \u201cany NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian.\u201d\n\nThe House committee\u2019s investigation will seek to determine whether any employees in either the Commerce Department or the Executive Office of the President directed NOAA to corroborate the president\u2019s false claims. The chairwomen\u2019s letter requested all answers and related documents from the Commerce Department no later than Sept. 20.\n\nThe committee is also asking for information from the Commerce Department\u2019s inspector general, Peggy Gustafson, regarding her own investigation into the matter.\n\nGustafson reportedly wrote NOAA employees on Sept. 6 that the National Weather Service \u201cmust maintain standards of scientific integrity\u201d and that allegations of outside interference threaten the agency\u2019s \u201cscientific influence.\u201d", "description": "The science panel will investigate who pushed NOAA to back up the president's false claims about Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d791caf3b00002b88d0c783.jpeg?cache=lsfmhpzdrk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
