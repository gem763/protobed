Saudi Arabia churns out at least 10 million barrels per day.\n\n\u201cThe biggest surprise is the degree and sophistication of the attack as well as the vulnerability of the Saudi facilities,\u201d Ion Energy Group Consultant Kyle Cooper told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM.\n\n\u201cIt was widely assumed that there were very significant defenses in place and that was the case. But yet there were multiple, multiple attacks that were able to breach these defenses,\u201d he added.\n\nSmoke billows after a fire at an Aramco factory in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on September 14.

The latter\u2019s suspected involvement also prompted concerns about whether the U.S. could be draw into a confrontation.\n\nWhen asked if Iran is the culprit, President Trump told reporters Monday afternoon \u201cit\u2019s looking that way.\u201d\n\nCooper contended that there remain a lot of \u201cunknowns\u201d for the outlook on oil production moving forward. But he added that U.S. oil was a good investment, given that a terrorist attack on American facilities were \u201cmuch less likely\u201d for the market.\n\nStill, Saudi Arabia\u2019s troubles \u201cclearly reintroduces a much higher degree of supply risk in the market that has not been there for many, many years,\u201d he said.\n\nMcKenzie Stratigopoulos is a producer at Yahoo Finance.
