The movement and its followers have screwed up academia, politics, the news media, and all of the entertainment industry, especially comedy.\n\nThat\u2019s why it took comic-sized balls for Chappelle to roast nearly every sensitive topical event of the last year, including Me Too and the increasingly militant transgender political lobby. As described in my forthcoming book \u201cPrivileged Victims: How America\u2019s Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People,\u201d mainstream comedy doesn\u2019t really exist anymore. Social justice has replaced all of it with intersectionality and the privilege-versus-victim dogma.\n\nAll working comedians in America know it can cost them their careers if they don\u2019t play along, even if they don\u2019t quite understand when or why this happened.\n\nThe Sacrifice of Nimesh Patel\n\nIt was a stunning display in November last year when comedian Nimesh Patel was kicked off the stage at Columbia University for telling what is formerly known as \u201ca joke,\u201d because the spawn of the social justice movement on campus didn\u2019t approve. The set-up for Patel\u2019s bit was everything you\u2019d think the grievance fetishists of social justice would appreciate: a commentary on the marginalization of both blacks and gays. The punchline was even a tribute to the privileged victim\u2019s most sacred tenant: intersectionality.\n\nPatel described his New York neighborhood, where he said gay, black men tell him when they don\u2019t like his clothes. The joke ended with Patel\u2019s observation that being gay can\u2019t possibly be a choice because, after all, who would choose to be gay (aggrieved), on top of already being black (oppressed). \u201cNo one looks in the mirror and thinks, \u2018This black thing is too easy, let me just add another thing to it,\u2019\u201d went Patel\u2019s joke.\n\nThat\u2019s it. That was the punchline. It was funny enough, but Patel had breached social justice protocol in making light of those who claim to have been victimized by nature of their race, gender, or sexuality. Student leaders of Columbia\u2019s Asian American Alliance, which had invited Patel for their annual cultural event, stormed the stage to ask that he wrap up his routine and make his exit early.\n\n\u201cIs it because I\u2019m talking about uncomfortable stuff?\u201d he asked, not realizing he was set to endure a struggle session, the kind of public humiliation the social justice movement uses to punish violators.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a distinction between being uncomfortable and being disrespectful,\u201d one of the student leaders said, to whoops and applause from the idiot audience.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m being respectful,\u201d Patel replied.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think you\u2019re entitled to certain jokes you\u2019re making, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Patel, still not fully aware this was not a debate but a public flogging.\n\n\u201cI think the comments you were making about being gay and black is very disrespectful.\u201d\n\nPatel tried in vain to explain that the joke was actually provided to him by a real, living, gay, black man. \u201cThis is strange,\u201d he said. Then, in the most depressing and embarrassing moment of the entire incident, he attempted to save himself by trying to pull rank in victimhood.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s a strange time to be an Asian person in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that much, because it feels like there\u2019s a lot of racial tension. And at any moment, black and white people are going to go to war, and Indians are going to have to choose, and Asians are going to have to choose.\u201d\n\nPatel\u2019s Experience Wasn\u2019t an Anomaly\n\nYou almost want to hug Patel and tell him it\u2019s too late. He has already been offered as a sacrifice to social justice and the church of intersectionality.\n\nPatel went on to say he was sure none of his material had been disrespectful and that he thought any offense taken was a matter of \u201cgenerational\u201d difference. He finally left, and the audience applauded his exit. A week later, he wrote a tepid op-ed for The New York Times criticizing the student leaders who took him off the stage, while missing the point that his experience was not some fluke.\n\n\u201cI do not think we should let the actions of a small group \u2014 actions that get blown out of proportion because they feed a narrative many people want to hear \u2014 paint college campuses as bad places to perform and paint this next generation as doomed,\u201d he wrote, before na\u00efvely theorizing that the episode was a symptom of \u201ca 24-hour news cycle\u201d that makes it \u201chard to sift through and find the signal and find what is really being said.\u201d\n\nNo, Patel. No, no. This wasn\u2019t the action of \u201ca small group,\u201d and college students aren\u2019t victims of the \u201cnews cycle.\u201d This is the new reality, and it works just as social justice dictates.\n\nCountless Comedians Have Been \u2018Canceled\u2019\n\nWhat happened to Patel has happened to others in his field. Popular stand-up comic Colin Quinn is just as confounded by the new reality. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal in February 2019, he said, \u201cI feel like a lot of people now are saying, \u2018You know what? Comedy is supposed to be uplifting.\u2019 It\u2019s like, what are you, the new moral majority all of a sudden?\u201d\n\nSteve Harvey, in March 2015, told a joke on his morning radio talk show that he had told several times before, involving a made-up, old, black church lady character named \u201cSister Odell\u201d and her annoyance at the special-needs daughter of a fellow churchgoer. Social justice took action on the internet, immediately calling for Harvey to be pulled from the air.\n\nHe apologized in a note on Facebook, explaining to the willfully ignorant mob that Sister Odell isn\u2019t real and no one else in the scenario of the joke is real, either. Although Harvey had bowed to social justice and the grievance gang, it seemed to go unnoticed that three months later on the Netflix show \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee,\u201d he admitted his apology was contrived to appease the humorless movement.\n\n\u201cYou know, I said she was 34 years old, sitting over there blowing bubbles,\u201d Harvey recalled of the fake special-needs person. \u201cWell, that was it. That was it. And boy, they went on Twitter, Instagram. \u2026 I apologized, I had to do it.\u201d He further explained that the apology was required to stave off advertisers from fleeing his TV program.\n\n\u201cBecause I got a talk show,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause now here comes a sponsor \u2014 and now all the rest of them have to piggyback and act righteous, too. \u2018Oh, they\u2019re pulling their sponsorship, well, we gotta act like we care too.\u2019 They don\u2019t really care. They don\u2019t really care. It\u2019s the deal. We got to act offended.\u201d\n\nEach and every working comedian knows the drill. They know they can\u2019t do real comedy anymore, not if they want to break it on a national level.\n\nToday\u2019s Comedy Isn\u2019t Comedy\n\nSo instead, we get the chubby Amy Schumer grabbing her crotch and lifting up her dress on stage. It\u2019s called \u201ccomedy,\u201d but it\u2019s intended to be a message of women \u201cempowerment\u201d and a middle finger to \u201cthe patriarchy.\u201d Her 2019 Netflix stand-up special, \u201cGrowing,\u201d boils down to one hour of Schumer lifting up her dress to show her underwear and stomach flab, along with references to her reproductive organs.\n\nWhen the punchline is always \u201cvagina!\u201d it ceases to be comedy. It is then simply a mantra, a message, a signal.\n\nThe movement has overwhelmed each and every part of our culture. Politics is no longer about practical policy. Higher education is no longer about prepping young adults for the workforce. The entertainment industry is no longer concerned with entertaining.\n\nAnd comedy is no longer about making people laugh. It\u2019s about pushing a cause, reinforcing a dogma, and instilling a worldview. It\u2019s about social justice.", "description": "The social justice movement has screwed up academia, politics, the news media, and all of the entertainment industry, especially as it relates to comedy.", "authors": ["Eddie Scarry"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-05-at-4.20.24-PM-e1567714885103.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
