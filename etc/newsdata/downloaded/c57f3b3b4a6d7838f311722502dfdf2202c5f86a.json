In some distant, misty Neverland, there is a G.O.P. capable of balancing fiscal responsibility and limited-government principle with the creativity required to address working-class America\u2019s social crisis. But the world is what it is, and a party that offers nothing, whose ideological sclerosis and internal contradictions allow it to offer nothing, might as well just go pass a tax cut and call it a day.\n\nNot tax reform, which would improve the efficiency of the code. Just a plain old tax cut. That\u2019s all he believes this GOP is capable of:\n\nI\u2019m not saying that Republicans couldn\u2019t still do a comprehensive and permanent tax reform in theory. Set health care aside entirely and there are still lots of clever and plausible ways to overhaul and improve the tax code without sacrificing revenue. You could cap various perverse deductions that mostly benefit wealthy blue-state taxpayers, like the home-mortgage and state and local tax deductions, and use the savings to lower rates across the board. You could cut the corporate tax rate and raise the capital-gains tax rate to compensate, as Senator Mike Lee has proposed. You could even (gasp, heresy, gasp) raise the top income tax rate, as Steve Bannon reportedly wants to do, and use the savings to cut payroll taxes or fund a new child tax credit. But Republicans don\u2019t seem equipped to pull off anything complicated, they don\u2019t look united enough to take political risks, and they aren\u2019t ideologically ready to pass anything heretical. So barring a sudden transformation in the party and its leadership, a temporary, deficit-financed tax cut is the only thing that has a decent chance of happening.\n\nDouthat goes on to say that while a tax cut wouldn\u2019t be \u201cnot the greatest idea, neither is it a terrible one\u201d \u2014 provided that Republicans \u201cfocus on corporate and payroll taxes, on business and workers, instead of just aiming for the lowest possible top income tax rate.\u201d But what are the odds of that?\n\nHis rousing conclusion:\n\nPersonally I can live with a Trump administration that appoints conservative judges and fails at everything else, since judicial appointments are about the only thing I trust this G.O.P. to do. But if Congress insists on continuing to try legislating, I will give a 10-year tax cut my official Trump-era seal of approval: They could certainly do worse.\n\nAnd it\u2019s true! A party that borrows from the Chinese to give tax breaks to Wall Street financiers and billionaire heiresses would be an improvement on a party that does those things and starts catastrophic wars in the Middle East. But what are the odds we won\u2019t get more of those, too?\n\nNo wonder he longs for a king.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2017-07-19"}
