Add Interest\n\nPresident Donald Trump is asking his party to defend him even as his rising threats are increasingly more indefensible.\n\nIn a tone unique to Trump and his Twitter account, the president has raised the possibility of arresting the House Intelligence chairman for treason, suggested punishments could be in order for the whistleblower, and retweeted an ally who said impeachment could lead to \u201ca Civil War like fracture.\u201d\n\nTrump is following the playbook he used to discredit Robert Mueller and his investigation. But the consequences are potentially more serious during an impeachment inquiry, as the scattered Republican voices less than steadfast in their support are making clear.\n\nBrian Snyder/Reuters, FILE\n\nFormer Sen. Jeff Flake is telling his ex-colleagues that this is the moment to make a clear break and at least oppose reelection if removal is too strong.\n\n\u201cTrust me when I say that you can go elsewhere for a job. But you cannot go elsewhere for a soul,\u201d Flake wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.\n\nRepublicans would like to keep the focus on impeachment itself, by arguing that the evidence to remove a president from office simply isn\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not something that you have to defend here,\u201d House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy told \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d completely dismissing Democratic accusations.\n\nIt\u2019s the president, though, who is making that a difficult argument to stand behind. He runs the risk with every tweet of creating more that will need defending and explaining.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nThe final day for Democratic presidential candidates to qualify for the next debate, scheduled for Oct. 15 and hosted by CNN and the New York Times, is Tuesday.\n\nHeidi Gutman/Walt Disney Television\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and its partners announced their intention to hold the debate on one night, even though 12 candidates claim to have passed both the polling and fundraising benchmarks.\n\nThe group includes businessman Tom Steyer and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, neither of whom qualified for the last debate in September and would be new faces on a single stage.\n\nAt this point, no other campaigns seem close to meeting the thresholds for this month's showdown. If those 12 are certified, it will be packed podiums for sure, but also a real reckoning for candidates who continue to come up short.\n\nThe TIP with Adam Kelsey\n\nDespite recent polling that shows his campaign losing ground to Elizabeth Warren and continuing to trail Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders set the tone for Q3 fundraising Tuesday morning, announcing a massive $25.3 million haul -- a number that eclipses Warren's combined Q1 and Q2 and leaves the Vermont senator with more than $61.5 million in receipts on the year.\n\nPerhaps even more noteworthy is the number of individual donors that Sanders continues to attract -- his campaign announced last month that it eclipsed the 1 million unique contributor threshold faster than any presidential candidate in history.\n\nAnd though Biden, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg -- who announced a Q3 take of $19.1 million of his own early Tuesday morning -- continue to attract headlines (many of them negative in this progressive era) for their participation in closed-door fundraisers, Sanders and Warren remain steadfast in their commitment to small-dollar donors. Sanders' average contribution sits at $19 and the campaign claims only 0.1% of its donors have maxed out at $2,800.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether $25.3 million is yet another Sanders number soon to be surpassed by Warren, but in the interim it's clear that he and his army of supporters have the money to fight all the way through July 2020.\n\nBrian Snyder/Reuters\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" Podcast.
