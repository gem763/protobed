(AP) \u2014 LeBron James has stepped into the spotlight of the now-strained relationship between the NBA and China with his comments about the league executive who started the ongoing fallout with what James derided as a \u201cmisinformed\u201d tweet. Politicians, human rights groups and ordinary fans on social media have criticized the outspoken superstar, questioning the motivation of James\u2019 comments.\n\nJames spoke out Monday, his seven-minute session with reporters putting him squarely in the center of the ongoing international schism. Houston general manager Daryl Morey was \u201cnot really educated on the situation,\u201d James asserted, when he sent out that since-deleted Oct. 4 tweet showing support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests.\n\nOn Tuesday, James acknowledged the criticism \u2014 and said he expected that it would be coming.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a tough situation that we\u2019re all in right now, \u2026 I think when an issue comes up, if you feel passionate about it or you feel like it\u2019s something you want to talk about, then so be it,\u201d James said. \u201cI also don\u2019t think that every issue should be everybody\u2019s problem as well.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s comments unleashed an immediate backlash against James, who has often spoken out on social and political matters, with some expressing dismay that this time he seemed to be more concerned about protecting his own brand and financial interests in China, where he enjoys enormous popularity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been welcomed with open arms,\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to China probably 15 to 20 times \u2026 to have this beautiful game that we all love to be able to bring people together in the most positive way.\u201d\n\nThat is not the case right now. James was in China for the two games last week between his Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets that were played under most unusual circumstances \u2014 with no pregame or postgame media sessions, first by decree of the Chinese and then from the NBA, and with several major league Chinese partners pulling their support of the exhibitions.\n\nWith the Lakers and Nets now home, the rift and debate about what the league should have done continues, reinvigorated by James speaking out.\n\n\u201cThe situation \u2026 has flared up again,\u201d said Matt Powell, a sports business analyst at research firm The NPD Group. \u201cLeBron is getting a lot of criticism on social media.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t limited to the Twitter world, either.\n\nProtesters in Hong Kong on Tuesday trampled on James\u2019 jerseys, burning one, and threw basketballs at a photo of the four-time NBA MVP \u2014 a global sports icon whose image has taken a clear hit.\n\nAmong James\u2019 comments Monday night, his first publicly shared thoughts on the matter: \u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not only financially but emotionally, physically and spiritually\u201d by Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nThat fanned the fallout fire, including from U.S. lawmakers who said they believed the NBA\u2019s primary goal had been to protect the league\u2019s massive financial interest when it comes to its relationship with China instead of more vigorously defending Morey\u2019s right to free speech.\n\nSen. Rick Scott of Florida, a frequent critic of James, tweeted both Monday night and again Tuesday morning about the NBA star\u2019s comments, accusing him of \u201ckowtowing to Communist China.\u201d The office of Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska also tweeted at James, saying \u201cyou\u2019re parroting communist propaganda.\u201d\n\nMorey has not apologized, and has not said anything publicly since two tweets on Oct. 6 attempting to clarify his thinking.\n\nAt a media availability on Tuesday, several Rockets players and coach Mike D\u2019Antoni declined to say much of anything about James\u2019 comments.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d Rockets star guard James Harden told reporters.\n\nRockets center Tyson Chandler, who was James\u2019 teammate on the Lakers last season, also passed on expressing an opinion.\n\n\u201cI think again everybody\u2019s thoughts are their own,\u201d Chandler told reporters. \u201cI think LeBron\u2019s (are) his, Daryl\u2019s (are) his and I like to stay out of people\u2019s thoughts.\u201d\n\nTeammate forward Thabo Sefolosha, who was born in Switzerland and is in his first year with the Rockets, did touch briefly on the free-speech issue. \u201cEverybody is entitled to their opinion, entitled to what they want to say. That\u2019s the beauty about this country.\u201d\n\nChina is considered the fastest-growing market for Nike, with whom James has a lifetime endorsement deal. In the most recent fiscal year, its revenue from China jumped 21% from the previous year, while overall, sales in China made up 16% of Nike\u2019s total revenue.\n\nJames has often spoken out on issues he feels passionate about. When he played in Miami, he and other Heat players wore hoodies in reaction to the death of Trayvon Martin \u2014 an unarmed black teen who was wearing a hoodie when he was shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012.\n\nHe also has supported Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who began kneeling during the national anthem in an effort to raise awareness of racial oppression and police brutality. He\u2019s a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, campaigned for 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and most recently sat with California Gov. Gavin Newsom as the Democrat signed into law a bill that will allow college athletes in that state to hire agents and make money from endorsement deals.\n\nNewsom signed that bill while appearing on a special episode of HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Shop: Uninterrupted\u201d \u2014 part of James\u2019 off-court business empire. James is also the founder of a school for inner-city kids in his hometown of Akron, Ohio.\n\nJames said his reaction to Morey\u2019s tweet, which read \u201cFight For Freedom: Stand With Hong Kong\u201d before it was deleted within hours as the Chinese backlash grew, was not about its substance. Rather, he wrote, it was his belief that the Rockets\u2019 executive did not consider the ramifications \u2014 or the timing, while he and his teammates were in China.\n\n\u201cMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\n___\n\nReynolds reported from Miami.
