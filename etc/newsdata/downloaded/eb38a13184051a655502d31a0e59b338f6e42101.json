REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun\n\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - A Byzantine-era church built in honour of an unnamed martyr has been unearthed near Jerusalem after a three-year excavation, Israeli researchers said on Wednesday.\n\nThe dig uncovered floors decorated with vast mosaics depicting birds, fruit and plants, colourful frescoes, and a curious Greek inscription that has baffled the researchers.\n\n\u201cWe found one inscription in the courtyard of the church which dedicates the site in the memory of a \u2018glorious martyr,\u2019\u201d said Benyamin Storchan, who directed the excavation. \u201cThe martyr is unnamed and it\u2019s still a mystery.\u201d\n\nThe Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) dates the shrine, located about 10 miles west of Jerusalem, to the 6th century.\n\nAn underground crypt found below the main part of the church is believed to have housed the martyr\u2019s remains. \u201cThis is the holiest place in the church,\u201d said Storchan, adding that pilgrims likely frequented the site.\n\nThough the martyr in question is unknown, Storchan said the lavishness of the complex may indicate this person was an important figure. Another inscription showed Byzantine emperor Tiberius II Constantinus had helped fund the church\u2019s later expansion.\n\n\u201cWe know of a few hundred churches in the Holy Land but this church by far surpasses most of them by its state of preservation and the imperial involvement which funded it,\u201d said Storchan.", "description": "A Byzantine-era church built in honour of an unnamed martyr has been unearthed near Jerusalem after a three-year excavation, Israeli researchers said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Ronen Zvulun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444081305&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0X1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
