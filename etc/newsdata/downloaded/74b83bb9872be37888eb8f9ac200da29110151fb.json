He ran back to his patrol car, got a pair of latex gloves and a fresh blanket, and delivered the baby almost immediately.\n\n\u201cCongratulations, you have a baby girl,\u201d he said.\n\nPounds has three children and has been in the delivery room before, but never on the receiving end, he said.\n\n\u201cIt happened so quickly,\u201d Pounds said.\n\nPounds said the training he received as a Sheriff's Office deputy prepared him for the delivery of the baby.\n\nSgt. David Drucks, left, and Deputy Robert Pounds, right, speak during a press conference at the Leila B. Canant Professional Development Center in Naples on Wednesday, October 2, 2019. Deputy Pounds pulled over a speeding car early Tuesday morning, and found that a passenger in the car was in labor. Deputy Pounds called for backup and EMS, and helped to deliver a baby girl. More\n\nSheriff\u2019s Sgt. David Drucks \u2013 one of the deputies who responded for backup \u2013 could hear the stress in Pounds voice on the radio.\n\n\"I don\u2019t get shook up too easily, but this was a little nerve-wrecking just because it was a newborn,\" Pounds said. \"My training kicked in and I just wanted to help mom and the baby.\n\nThe couple could not be reached for comment.\n\nAt first, Pounds thought Wilfrid was just trying to get out of a speeding ticket.\n\n\"You'd be surprised, there's several excuses you get for stopping somebody for speeding,\" Pounds said.\n\n\"That was a pretty reasonable excuse.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Naples Daily News: Collier County deputy stops speeding motorist, then helps deliver baby", "description": "Deputy Robert Pounds ran back to his patrol car, got a pair of latex gloves and a fresh blanket, and delivered the baby almost immediately.", "authors": ["Jessica Rodriguez", "Naples Daily News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PvhHQPwkdb2T.zwzeXIHqw--~B/aD00ODA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/51a669fede998c61f4538327b1f76db5", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
