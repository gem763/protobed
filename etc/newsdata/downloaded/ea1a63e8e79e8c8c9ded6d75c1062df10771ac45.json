The cards will be available from October 22nd through November 5th \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to pick them up right here \u2014 and a percentage of sales will go to the Extra Life children\u2019s charity.\n\nThe new My Little Pony-themed MTG gear, which, naturally, has been dubbed Ponies: The Galloping, will be available in two bundles. First, there\u2019s a set of three cards \u2014 silver-bordered, double-sided Princess Luna / Nightmare Moon Magic card; silver-bordered Princess Twilight Sparkle Magic card; and a silver-boarded Rarity Magic card \u2014 which will cost $50, with $30 going to charity.\n\nYou can also pick up a $100 play mat bundle ($80 goes toward charity) which includes three mats (two single-sided, one double-sided). And for those who play digitally, between October 28th and November 2nd, the cards will also be for sale in Magic: The Gathering Arena.\n\nIt\u2019s a brief window, and the cards will only be available in the US and Canada, but it goes toward a good cause. And the collaboration does confirm one My Little Pony fact: friendship really is magic.", "description": "Wizards of the Coast is partnering with Hasbro for My Little Pony-themed Magic: The Gathering cards, with a percentage of sales going toward the Extra Life children\u2019s charity.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cKLfmF7nmYyEaFCInK3ISdFm1aY=/0x82:1319x773/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19257187/MTGPTG_CrdBx_01_01.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
