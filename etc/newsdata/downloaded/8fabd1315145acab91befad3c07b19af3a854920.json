(Image: National Trust/Seth Jackson)\n\nBritish conservationists have figured out why a protected island near the UK\u2019s southwest coast is littered with thousands of elastic bands.\n\nMullion Island is an uninhabited island on the eastern coast of Cornwall county in the southern UK. The tiny landmass measures only about 260 metres across. Because the entirety of Mullion Island has been set aside as a bird sanctuary, anyone wanting to visit the rocky outcrop requires a special permit.\n\nRecently, rangers with the UK National Trust \u2014 an organisation dedicated to the preservation of Britain\u2019s historical and natural places \u2014 were alerted to something odd on the island: thousands of elastic bands strewn along the shoreline.\n\nMullion Island. (Image: National Trust)\n\n\u201cWe first noticed the bands on a monitoring visit during the breeding season and were puzzled why there were so many and how they\u2019d got there,\u201d Mark Grantham, a researcher with the West Cornwall Ringing Group \u2014 an organisation that tracks the movement of birds \u2014 said in a National Trust release.\n\nNot wanting to disturb the nesting birds, Grantham and his colleagues waited until this spring to return to the island to clean up the mess.\n\n\u201cWithin just an hour we\u2019d collected thousands of bands and handfuls of fishing waste,\u201d he said.\n\nThat fishing waste included small bundles of green fishing net and twine, some of which took the form of small pellets \u2014 a telltale sign the indigestible waste had ventured through an avian digestive system.\n\nA pellet of indigestible waste containing a yellow elastic band. (Image: National Trust/Seth Jackson)\n\nIn a press release published Wednesday, rangers from the National Trust say they\u2019ve finally figured out what\u2019s going on: Great black-backed and herring gulls, both of which roost on the island, are confusing the rubber bands for worms. The gulls are apparently snatching discarded bands from agricultural fields on the mainland and bringing them back to Mullion Island. The elastic bands can get stuck in their stomachs, preventing the birds from feeding on the real worms that would nourish them.\n\nThis is a sad example of the unforeseen consequences of human carelessness, and how even protected sanctuaries are not immune to our waste.\n\nBundles of plastic fishing net and twine regurgitated by seagulls.

The numbers of great black-backed gulls \u2014 the largest species of gull in the world \u2014 have dropped by 30 per cent in recent years, and herring gulls are on the UK\u2019s Red List of Birds of Conservation Concern. Threats to Britain\u2019s seabirds include declining fish stocks, loss of habitat, warming seas, entanglement in fishing nets and ingestion of plastics, according to the National Trust.\n\n\u201cIngested plastic and rubber is another factor in a long list of challenges which our gulls and other seabirds must contend with just to survive,\u201d said Holder.", "description": "British conservationists have figured out why a protected island near the UK\u2019s southwest coast is littered with thousands of elastic bands....", "authors": ["Ryan F.
