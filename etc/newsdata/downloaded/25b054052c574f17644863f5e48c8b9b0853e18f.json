A unique group of artworks is on display, in addition to its collection of paintings and drawings by the Italian master. The exhibition opens on Oct. 24. [AP/YONHAP]\n\nMuch about Leonardo da Vinci remains an enigma - the smile of the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d why the world\u2019s most famous painter left so many works unfinished, and more recently, who bought the contentious \u201cSalvator Mundi.\u201dA new exhibit at the Louvre, however, opening Thursday and marking the 500th anniversary of the Italian master\u2019s death, tries to sketch out as complete a picture of the artist and thinker as possible.Drawing from the Louvre\u2019s permanent collection and institutions around the world, the exhibit brings together some 160 works. They include Leonardo\u2019s masterpieces, dozens of studies and scientific sketches, and pieces by other artists in Leonardo\u2019s orbit. Visitors can also experience a virtual reality portion of the exhibit that delves into the story behind the \u201cMona Lisa.\u2019\u2019\u201cWe wished, in order to pay homage to the artist, to be able to show the entirety of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s career and his development and to explain, ultimately, the sense of his life,\u2019\u2019 curator Vincent Delieuvin told The Associated Press.The exhibit runs through Feb. 24, 2020. Visitors must reserve tickets online in advance, and the Louvre said it has already pre-sold 220,000 tickets as of Monday morning.More than 10 years in the making, the project began when Louis Frank, the exhibit\u2019s other curator, translated a Renaissance-era biography on the painter to round out existing knowledge about the artist\u2019s life. That biographical emphasis is evident in the exhibit\u2019s design, which traces the artist\u2019s trajectory from his apprenticeship with Florentine sculptor Andrea del Verocchio to his death in France in 1519.With a whole room devoted to his scientific pursuits, it seeks to capture the quest for knowledge and perfection of a man Delieuvin called \u201ca universal genius.\u2019\u2019\u201cLeonardo da Vinci, he is one of those rare men, those personalities who fascinate us, because he was universal,\u2019\u2019 Delieuvin said. \u201cHe had an interest in all aspects of nature, we all see ourselves in his personality.\u2019\u2019Several of Leonardo\u2019s completed paintings will be on display, including \u201cLa Belle Ferronniere\u2019\u2019 and \u201cThe Virgin and Child with Saint Anne.\u2019\u2019 The \u201cMona Lisa\u2019\u2019 will remain in its case, upstairs. Visitors will be able to see \u201cPortrait of a Musician\u2019\u2019 on loan from the Vatican and \u201cBenois Madonna\u2019\u2019 from St. Petersburg, among other works the Louvre borrowed for the occasion.Some pieces proved more difficult to obtain. The \u201cVitruvian Man,\u2019\u2019 Leonardo\u2019s famous drawing of the ideally proportioned male figure, arrived in France from Venice\u2019s Accademia Gallery only days before the exhibit\u2019s opening.Italian heritage group Our Italy tried to block the loan, saying the drawing was too fragile to be moved. An Italian court originally suspended the loan before ruling last week that it could travel to France for eight weeks. In exchange, the Louvre will lend several works by Raphael to Rome next yearAP", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/22185507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
