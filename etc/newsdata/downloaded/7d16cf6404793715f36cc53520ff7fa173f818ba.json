USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Even before he wore a Los Angels Lakers uniform, Anthony Davis already fulfilled a child-hood dream.\n\nHe filmed Space Jam 2 this summer, which not only gave him an early glimpse on what it is like to work with LeBron James. Davis also gained more perspective on the time and work it takes to perfect something.\n\n\"That was definitely frustrating \u2014 the 'hurry-up-and-wait.' You\u2019re just there waiting around to shoot your scene,\" Davis recalled in an interview with USA TODAY Sports. \"But just seeing the way they take everything seriously and how perfect they want everything to be, it was cool. I\u2019ve never been on set for that much time. I think it was a cool experience.\"\n\nNot a cool enough experience, however, for Davis to pursue long-term.\n\nSTAFF PICKS: Award predictions and championship picks for 2019-20\n\nBOLD PREDICTIONS: Looking into the crystal ball for 2019-20 season\n\nWhen the Lakers finally acquired Davis in a blockbuster trade from the New Orleans Pelicans in July, Davis did not immediately map out how he can expand his business profile here. Ever since Davis\u2019 agent, Rich Paul, had asked the Pelicans to trade Davis before last season\u2019s deadline, he became solely interested in which team would help him the best to win his first NBA championship entering his eighth season. Davis only joined the Space Jam 2 cast because the filming took place during the summer.\n\n\"I just want to play basketball,\" said the 26-year-old Davis. \"I have plenty of time in my career later on or after I retire to do that stuff. But right now, I\u2019m just focused on basketball and trying to be the best basketball player I can be.\"\n\nSo far, so good. Partly because of Davis, the Lakers enter the 2019-20 NBA season feeling optimistic they can finally return to the playoffs for the first time since 2013 and hoist their first championship trophy since 2010. The Lakers do not read much into Davis\u2019 preseason results: 13 points per game on 42.9% shooting with 6.3 rebounds and 3.8 assists. Those numbers will likely skyrocket once Davis logs more than 20.8 minutes per game against real competition. The Lakers, however, already see positive glimpses of Davis\u2019 adaptability, his instant chemistry with James and his ability to make everything look easy.\n\n\"He\u2019s just so special in the league with how he can guard the rim and on the perimeter equally as good,\" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \"With just his touch, shot-making and how easily the game comes to him, you don\u2019t have to force-feed touches to him. He finds them because of his skill set.\"\n\nLOAD MANAGEMENT: How will Lakers manage minutes for LeBron and AD?\n\nWHO WE'RE WATCHING: 25 most interesting players for the 2019-20 season\n\nTo maximize that skill set, Davis said he has no aspirations to spend any of this season expanding his business portfolio here. He already has lived in Los Angeles each offseason during his seven-year NBA career with the Pelicans. Therefore, Davis did not sound too interested in exploring where his new favorite restaurants and hangout spots will be. Instead, Davis sounded more consumed with determining the best routes on his drive to the Lakers\u2019 practice facility and to Staples Center.\n\n\"I\u2019m just leaving as early as possible,\" Davis said. \"Give yourself ample time to make sure you need to be where you\u2019re at.\"\n\nDavis did not figure out the traffic patterns well enough to arrive early enough for the team\u2019s media day last month. Though Davis technically arrived on time, Lakers veteran teammate Rajon Rondo chastised him for not showing up early. Yet, it seems safe to presume Davis will give himself plenty of time to arrive on time for the Lakers\u2019 season opener against the Los Angeles Clippers in a designated road game on Tuesday at Staples Center.\n\nThen, Davis anticipated \"there will be some butterflies and just being nervous.\" And why not? The Lakers traded several pieces for their long-term future, including Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and a handful of draft picks, in hopes that Davis would like to stay here long-term. James, who is entering his 17th season, has publicly vouched for Davis since the middle of last season. While the Lakers\u2019 front office consulted with James and Davis on their subsequent offseason moves, James encouraged the team\u2019s coaching staff to make the system primarily revolved around Davis.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: Where every team stands heading into the season\n\nYet, Davis maintained he has yet to feel a pinch-me moment since arriving here. He anticipated that likely will change once he wears a Lakers jersey on opening night. Then, the Lakers have a chance to maintain the local buzz here against the Clippers. Though they will feature Finals MVP, Kawhi Leonard, they will play without Paul George as he recovers from offseason surgery on his left shoulder.\n\n\"Hopefully afterwards, it is a good feeling,\" Davis said. \"Even if we lose, it\u2019s still going to be a good feeling knowing that I got to play at Staples for the first time. It\u2019s going to be a great season. We\u2019re going to make sure we have fun with it.\"\n\nWhat will it take to have a fun season? Well, Davis seems more consumed with business than fun. He organized preseason workouts in Las Vegas before training camp started. Davis has become vocal on the court and on the sideline with both providing and inviting constructive feedback. Davis considers it a priority for the team to have a culture that handles problems internally instead of becoming consumed with outside opinion and distraction. Although he mostly wants to just win an NBA championship this season, Davis believes his ability to win the league\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year award could lead to hoisting the most important hardware.\n\n50TH ANNIVERSARY: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's NBA debut captivated the country\n\n\"It\u2019s about being the best rim protector I can be and guarding the perimeter, talking on defense and helping guys out,\" Davis said. \"It\u2019s about helping this team to be a top three defensive team in the league this year. In order for us to do that, we all have to come out with a defensive mindset. That starts with me and \u2018Bron. For me, I want to be the one that leads the charge defensively.\"\n\nThat seems to be an easier role for Davis to play than to memorize lines on set. Unlike during his brief time filming a movie, Davis expects will he not have to wait as long for the results. And to achieve the results he wants, Davis remains more focused on producing a blockbuster than starring in one.\n\nFollow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "Anthony Davis insists he's not interested in his business profile or movies now that he's playing in Los Angeles. \"I\u2019m just focused on basketball.\"", "authors": ["Mark Medina", "Published A.M.
