The elbow has bothered Freeman for about two months, and he said he could not straighten his right arm before taking the time off.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n''I feel really good,'' the 30-year-old Freeman said. ''I can straighten my arm with no problem. I'm very encouraged. I guess I just needed the four days off.''\n\nFreeman, a left-handed batter and righty thrower, expected to play all three games this weekend in New York to conclude the regular season. Atlanta will host an NL Division Series opener on Thursday.\n\nFreeman is batting .296 and has set career highs with 38 home runs and 121 RBIs. He hasn't homered since Sept. 1.\n\n''Now he feels like he's good to go for about two months,'' manager Brian Snitker said.\n\nNotes: Snitker said OF Ender Inciarte will be shut down after his strained right hamstring did not respond well to running this week. Inciarte could return for the second round of the playoffs.\n\n---\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports", "description": "Freddie Freeman says his rested right elbow is good to go, and he expects it to be that way through the postseason.
