After bursting onto the EDM scene in 2015 with his debut single S\u00ed \u2013 a remix which uses the celebratory exclamation soccer player Christiano Ronaldo shouts when he scores a big goal \u2013 he gained international fame with the release of club anthem Solo Dance. The music video for the song currently has more than 48 million views on YouTube.\n\nJensen is currently on tour, and we were lucky enough to catch him while he was in Asia. Young Post sat down with the 28-year-old at the Universal Music Headquarters in Kwun Tung and discussed his decision to transition from a DJ to a recording artist, and where he envisions his career moving next.\n\nHong Kong indie group Nowhere Boys won't let success change them\n\nHe grew up in Silkeborg, a small town in Denmark, with a population of a little more than 90,000. While he is now based in the capital city of Copenhagen, it, too, is lacking in some crucial attractions. \u201cThe EDM scene there is non-existent,\u201d he says.\n\nSo, how did the then-15-year-old Jensen get into the genre, and end up making his own electronic dance music beats?\n\nMartin Jensen is one of the few Danish artists to break into the worldwide music scene. Photo: Petra Kleis\n\n\u201cI discovered it after setting a goal for myself \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to focus on the [Danish music scene],\u201d he tells us. \u201cIt\u2019s the best decision I ever made, as I never really liked living in a small country \u2013 I love travelling and exploring what\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not easy for a Danish artist to break into the international market, he adds.\n\n\u201cOnly a handful of us have done it \u2013 MO, Michael Learns to Rock, and Lukas Graham, to name a few. Danish record labels are focused on the domestic market, so you need to find a way to promote your own work and produce a song that can help you achieve international success,\u201d he adds.\n\nJ-rock band AliA's debut gives each member a chance to shine\n\nBecoming a recording artist was not part of Jensen\u2019s plans until just two weeks before releasing his first single.\n\n\u201cI was always a DJ. I never focused on becoming an artist \u2013 I would DJ at parties and go home, day in and day out,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I became an artist because I hated following a routine that\u2019s similar to that of a factory worker.\n\n\u201cAs a DJ, you only get a small part of the cake [a club\u2019s total earnings], and have very limited creative control. I\u2019d rather take risks and jump into the life of an artist, and it doesn\u2019t matter if I fail.\u201d\n\nAnother good thing about being an artist, he says, is that he doesn\u2019t have to shoulder as much responsibility as he did when he was DJing.\n\nSeasons for Change lead singer on balancing his time between music and teaching\n\n\u201cDuring a show, the lead singer of a band can take a break while the guitarist performs a solo for the crowd, but DJs can\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s no time for toilet breaks in a 90-minute set, and, if something goes wrong, it\u2019s your responsibility, and you have to rely on yourself,\u201d explains Jensen.\n\nDespite having performed at festivals such as Tomorrowland and Lollapalooza, Jensen says he doesn\u2019t care how many people he\u2019s playing to, as long as they are engaged. \u201cMy ideal gig is when the crowd is with me, wherever or however big the venue it is, as long as the audience is reacting well to [my music].\u201d\n\nJensen is keeping busy. In May, he collaborated with James Arthur, the winner of the ninth season of British talent competition The X Factor, and released a track called Nobody. And just last Friday, he teamed up with fellow Dane Malte Ebert and dropped another feel-good single called I Could Get Used To This.\n\nAside from releasing new music, this year, Jensen is also focusing on launching his own label, and hopes to mentor younger artists.\n\n\u201cAny new artist can send in materials to us \u2013 it\u2019s hard for new DJs or artists to break into the market. It\u2019s a lot easier if they get help from experienced artists.\u201d", "description": "After making waves with hits like 'S\u00ed', 'Solo Dance' and 'I Could Get Used To This', he plans to launch his own label and mentor younger artists", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/martinjensen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
