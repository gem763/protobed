Experts had previously thought our species evolved all over Africa.\n\nOur ancient ancestors originated just south of the Zambezi River once home to an enormous lake similar in size to England, called Lake Makgadikgadi.\n\nThe lake stretched all the way from Namibia, across Botswana and into Zimbabwe. As it began to break-up a vast wetland was created providing a lush home abundant with plants and trees for our earliest relatives.\n\n(Image: Google Maps)\n\nIt was here early humans thrived for 70,000 years until the climate changed and they were forced to leave Africa to populate the rest of the planet.\n\nVanessa Hayes, of Sydney University, said: \u201cIt has been clear for some time anatomically modern humans appeared in Africa roughly 200,000 years ago.\n\n\u201cWhat has been long debated is the exact location of this emergence and subsequent dispersal of our earliest ancestors.\n\n\u201cThis [study] enabled us to pinpoint the ancestral homeland of all humans. It is the first time the exact location has been identified.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe international team collected blood samples from study participants in Namibia and South Africa and looked at their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).\n\nAs mtDNA is passed almost exclusively from mother to child through the egg cell, its sequence stays the same over generations, making it a useful tool for looking at maternal ancestry.\n\nThe study published in the journal Nature focused on the L0 lineage - modern human\u2019s earliest known population.\n\nProf Hayes added: \u201cThe first migrants ventured north east, followed by a second wave of migrants who travelled south west.\n\n\u201cA third population remained in the homeland until today.\u201d\n\n\u201cMitochondrial DNA acts like a time capsule of our ancestral mothers, accumulating changes slowly over generations.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHer international team collected blood samples from 1,217 people to establish a comprehensive catalogue of the \u2018L0\u2019 lineage.\n\nIt comes two years after a study suggested Homo sapiens emerged all over Africa simultaneously and not in one place.\n\nResearchers said the success of the first humans came from learning how to scoop up seafood, including fish, with their hands.\n\nClimate computer models were also used to simulate South Africa\u2019s climate history over the past 250,000 years.\n\nAuthor Prof Axel Timmermann, of Pusan National University, South Korea, said: \u201cThey suggest the slow wobble of Earth\u2019s axis changes summer solar radiation in the Southern Hemisphere, leading to periodic shifts in rainfall across southern Africa.\n\n\u201cThese shifts in climate would have opened green, vegetated corridors, first 130,000 years ago to the northeast, and then around 110,000 years ago to the southwest, allowing our earliest ancestors to migrate away from the homeland for the first time.\u201d\n\nFossil finds had hinted at modern humans originating in East African, whereas genetic analyses suggested they arose in South Africa.", "description": "Researchers have been able to pinpoint the geographical location where the earliest ancestors of anatomically modern humans arose 200,000 years ago", "authors": ["Martin Bagot", "Image", "De Agostini Via Getty Images", "Google Maps", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20742981.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Aerial-view-of-Victoria-Falls-on-Zambezi-River.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
