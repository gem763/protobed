She has got the evidence \u2013 it\u2019s all there.\n\n\"Coleen\u2019s evidence is bulletproof and she stands by it all. If Rebekah wants to sue, she\u2019s welcome to.\n\n\"Coleen will fight her and the proof is there. If it\u2019s in court, it\u2019s not ideal but Coleen will follow it through.\"\n\nLast night, Rebekah, who said she was \"disgusted\" she even had to deny leaking the stories, was seen looking distraught as she arrived back in the UK.\n\nAnd as she touched down at Heathrow Airport, it was clear she was upset.\n\nShe wiped tears from her eyes and she walked hand-in-hand with Jamie out of the airport.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nA spokesperson for Coleen also said she had \"irrefutable\" proof that it's Rebekah who has been leaking stories about Coleen to the press.\n\nThe representative said: \"It is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.\"\n\nAfter it all kicked off, Rebekah hit back in her own statement.\n\nShe wrote: \"As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n\"I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\n\"If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n\"Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\n\n\"I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n\"I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n\"I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\"\n\nMirror Online has contacted Coleen's representatives for comment.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
