I never drink from plastic water bottles. I always carry my own reusable coffee cup. I carry my own bamboo utensils,\" May said. \"I walk the talk every day.\"\n\nRARE SIGHTING OF GRIZZLY BEARS FIGHTING IN THE MIDDLE OF CANADA HIGHWAY CAUGHT ON VIDEO\n\nLast week, May launched the party's 2019 election platform that placed emphasis on \"progressive social and ecological policies,\" such as billions for post-secondary education and elimination of poverty through a guaranteed liveable income.\n\nCanada's Green Party is calling for a transition off fossil fuels to protect the environment, including working to protect endangered species and water quality that involves a ban on single-use plastics.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe image, which is now cropped so you cannot see May's hands, still remains on the Green Party's website. Canadians go the polls on Oct. 21 in what will be May's fourth general election.\n\n\"I hope that despite this misstep by well-meaning party staff (who hoped to brand the image with our logo), people can believe that in the original photo there is nothing I would have hidden,\" May added.", "description": "Now you see it, now you don't.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
