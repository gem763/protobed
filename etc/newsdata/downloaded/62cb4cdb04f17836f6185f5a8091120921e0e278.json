It was a season-high eighth win in a row, but the health of his team was more important for the second-year manager.\n\n\u201cSuzuki was the big question,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThe last few days he proved that he is ready to go. He is swinging the bat well.\u201d\n\nHis two-run homer in the third inning broke a tie and gave the Nationals a 3-1 lead. Suzuki also started at catcher before giving way to youngsters Raudy Read and Tres Barrera.\n\nThe Nationals (93-69) hope Suzuki can play a key role when the team hosts the Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday at 8:08 p.m. in the wild card game. The winner will advance to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in California on Thursday in Game 1 of the National League Division Series.\n\nWashington was 19-31 in late May and became the first team in 105 years to go from 12 games under .500 and finish the season 24 games over .500. The Nationals are only the ninth team in history to make the playoffs after being 12 games under .500 at some point in the season.\n\n\u201cEvery year in spring training, 30 teams set out to get to the postseason,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThat is the goal when you leave spring training. The boys did that; they are playing good ball.\u201d\n\nSuzuki, who dealt with right elbow inflammation, has played in just eight games this month with only 19 at-bats. But he has five hits, with two homers and a double.\n\nAnother minor concern was left fielder Juan Soto, who is hitting .114 in his last 15 games.\n\nBut the sophomore star smashed a run-scoring double Sunday and was 1-for-2. He ended his second season with 35 homers and 110 RBI at the age of 20.\n\n\u201cI have been working really hard the last couple of days,\u201d Soto said.\n\nAnother nice feather to the season was right-handed reliever Aaron Barrett, who pitched the seventh inning and allowed a run on a wild pitch.\n\nIt was his first appearance at Nationals Park since 2015. Since then, he has endured several arm problems before returning to the minors last year and then making it to the majors with the Nationals earlier this month in a game at the Atlanta Braves.\n\n\u201cBeing able to be back here in front of the home crowd in game 162, the fans were incredible,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cI felt their energy. It was definitely a special moment, for sure.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals were just 33-42 this season against teams that had a record over .500. But all of that won\u2019t matter in a do-or-die game Tuesday against the Brewers (89-73), who won\u2019t hesitate to use a lot of relievers. One of their top relievers is lefty Josh Hader, from Millersville, Maryland.\n\n\u201cThey are a tough team,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThey have been playing really well.\u201d And so have the Nationals.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
