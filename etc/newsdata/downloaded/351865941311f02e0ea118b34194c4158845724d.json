That, and the claim of \u201cfirsthand knowledge,\u201d suggests testimony that might bolster the impeachment case against Mr. Trump and further undermine one of his main defense claims: that the accusations against him are based on inaccurate, secondhand information.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Friday that an intelligence official who has more direct knowledge of Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine than the first whistle-blower, and who had grown alarmed by the president\u2019s behavior, was weighing whether to come forward. The second official was among those interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general to corroborate the allegations of the original whistle-blower, one of the people briefed on the matter said.\n\n\u00a9 Getty\n\nFor Democratic lawmakers seeking to build their case for impeachment, the new whistle-blower could serve as an important witness for both validating what they know and potentially providing new leads for investigators. Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who is leading the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, urged other potential whistle-blowers to come forward on Sunday night.\n\n\u201cWe thank them for their courage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thank them for their patriotism. And we hope others will follow their courageous example.\u201d\n\nOne member of the legal team confirmed on Twitter that the firm was now representing \u201cmultiple whistleblowers\u201d but declined to say how many. The inspector general has said that to corroborate the first whistle-blower\u2019s complaint, he interviewed multiple people who would be afforded protections, and it was unclear if the lawyer could be referring to those people or other people.\n\nSince the first whistle-blower emerged, the White House has tried to unmask his identity, and dismiss him as a \u201cdeep state operative\u201d with partisan motives to \u201ctake down\u201d Mr. Trump. The president stuck to form on Sunday evening in trying to dismiss the new whistle-blower.\n\n\u201cDemocrat lawyer is same for both Whistleblowers?\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cAll support Obama and Crooked Hillary. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nRelated: Donald Trump - life in pictures (Photos)\n\nThe lawyers representing both whistle-blowers said the emergence of a second account should take the focus off the identities of the individuals coming forward.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that the focus will appropriately shift to the substance and merits of the allegations rather than the individual whistle-blowers, each of whom has a legal right to remain anonymous,\u201d said Mark S. Zaid, one of the whistle-blower\u2019s lawyers.\n\nMr. Zaid said the official\u2019s act of coming forward to the inspector general had secured whistle-blower protections, and it was not clear if the whistle-blower would file a formal complaint.\n\nThe official has also not communicated yet with any congressional committees, Mr. Zaid said. But Democrats said the speed with which the case was becoming public was itself a strong sign of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that people around the president, professionals, who are in the Oval Office, who are in the Situation Room, are watching what is happening and are finally saying, \u2018My God, this cannot happen anymore,\u2019 and they are coming forward,\u201d Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the second-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why impeaching Trump is a mistake\n\n\u00a9 AP\n\nEven before the second whistle-blower\u2019s emergence, lawmakers leading the impeachment inquiry were preparing for another jam-packed week of fact-finding that could significantly shape their case. They are scheduled to talk to at least two senior American diplomats: Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine who was abruptly removed from her post this year after running afoul of the White House, and Gordon D. Sondland, Mr. Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union who closely managed the relationship between the White House and the new Ukrainian government.\n\nTwo associates of Mr. Trump\u2019s private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said to have played roles in his shadow campaign to push for investigations in Ukraine that could benefit the president have also been called to testify. Additional requests for documents and witnesses are also expected.\n\nThe first whistle-blower, a C.I.A. officer who was detailed to the National Security Council, filed a complaint in August outlining how Mr. Trump used his power to push Ukraine to investigate Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and current presidential candidate, as well as his son Hunter Biden, including in a July 25 phone call with the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe disclosure of a new whistle-blower, first reported by the ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on his show \u201cThis Week,\u201d appeared likely to help House Democrats\u2019 reconstruction of events, even as the White House has so far refused to comply with requests for documents related to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to press Ukraine to investigate a leading political rival, and any attempt to conceal his actions.\n\nBut on Sunday, the White House shrugged off the news, arguing that it did not change the fact that Mr. Trump did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many people decide to call themselves whistle-blowers about the same telephone call \u2014 a call the president already made public \u2014 it doesn\u2019t change the fact that he has done nothing wrong,\u201d said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary.\n\nMr. Giuliani framed the news of the new whistle-blower on Sunday as a political hit on the president. \u201cSURPRISE Democrat lawyer has other secret sources,\u201d Mr. Giuliani wrote on Twitter. He added that the bottom line was that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d attached to Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukrainian officials to investigate his political rivals, and called the story an \u201cORCHESTRATED DEM CAMPAIGN LIKE KAVANAUGH,\u201d referring to the sexual misconduct allegations against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing.\n\nBut with information evolving unusually quickly, few senior congressional Republicans or White House officials have been willing to step out publicly to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. The White House, which has been riven internally about how to handle impeachment proceedings, with no one clearly in charge, did not have any senior officials making the case on the Sunday news shows to defend Mr. Trump.\n\nOf those congressional allies who did make public comments on Sunday, several either focused on attacking Democrats\u2019 handling of the case or said they would reserve judgment until they saw more facts.\n\nSenator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and a key member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was interested to learn more about the new whistle-blower and offered no defense of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine. Instead, he said he first wanted to see the results of the Senate\u2019s bipartisan investigation of the matter before making a judgment.\n\n\u201cYou have to assume if it is essentially a partisan vote in the House, that that sets the stage for likely the same kind of vote in the Senate,\u201d Mr. Blunt said on CBS. \u201cBut let\u2019s see what the facts are.\u201d\n\nOthers were more squarely behind the president.\n\nRepresentative Chris Stewart, Republican of Utah and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he was \u201cnot at all\u201d concerned by the emergence of another whistle-blower because he had already seen a rough transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s July call with Ukraine\u2019s president that, in his view, was not problematic.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Representative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most steadfast defenders, said the president was merely interested in rooting out legitimate accusations of corruption and that Democrats were unfairly vilifying him for it.\n\nBut pressed a half-dozen times to say whether he approved of Mr. Trump\u2019s public remarks this week calling on China to investigate the Bidens, Mr. Jordan would not answer.\n\n\u201cI think he has you guys all spun up,\u201d he said, repeating a line frequently used by Republicans in recent days. \u201cI don\u2019t think he really meant go investigate. Do you think China is really going to investigate?\u201d\n\nSenator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said in a heated exchange on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Mr. Trump had \u201cvehemently, angrily denied\u201d to him withholding aid for Ukraine in exchange for investigating his political rivals.\n\n\u201cUnlike the narrative of the press that President Trump wants to dig up dirt on his 2020 opponent, what he wants is an accounting of what happened in 2016,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.\n\nSheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting from Los Angeles.\n\nMSN UK is committed to Empowering the Planet and taking urgent action to protect our environment.
