It comes less than a year after the opening of Catch Las Vegas in the Aria Hotel.\n\nThe bi-level, 15,000 square foot space in Chelsea\u2019s Maritime Hotel, which was formerly home to Mario Batali\u2019s La Sirena, is a mere three blocks from the original Catch location.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the second I think that we\u2019re too big or too busy or we\u2019ve got enough employees to do that job, that\u2019s the time where we suffer and become pass\u00e9 or go out of business,\u201d says Birnbaum. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of everything falling apart at any time.\u201d\n\nFor that reason, he approaches each restaurant opening like it\u2019s his first. That\u2019s why he\u2019s always searching for and documenting ideas and inspiration on his frequent travels, whether it be at a famous restaurant in Italy or a Marriott business hotel\u2014if he sees a good idea, he documents it.\n\n\u201cI try to travel to new places as much as I can to different parts of not just the country but also the world, and I\u2019m always searching [for ideas],\u201d he says. \u201cWhether I\u2019m traveling or my [business] partner\u2019s traveling, we\u2019re texting each other like, \u2018Show me pictures, show me videos.\u2019\u201d\n\nBirnbaum says that he and business partner Eugene Remm send photos or videos to each other and to their front of house staff, executive team, or kitchen almost daily, whether it\u2019s a cocktail, a coffee, a dessert presentation or a table-side Caesar salad.\n\nWhen it came to opening Catch Steak, Birnbaum once again channeled his love of travel to inspire everything from the interior design to the menu. Instead of looking primarily to Europe, as with each of the seafood-focused Catch locations\u2014from tapas in Barcelona to the seafood in Mykonos\u2014he (mostly) stayed closer to home.\n\n\u201cI ate at almost every traditional classic steakhouse in New York, Chicago, L.A. and Miami,\u201d says Birnbaum. \u201cWe must have tasted 75 different cuts and styles of meat in Chicago, with our partners who actually own Morton\u2019s and Mastro\u2019s. These are places that have been doing steak a long time and we wanted to listen to them and understand the kind of things that we could change about the traditional steakhouse.\u201d\n\nAnother huge influence on Catch Steak was a recent trip Remm took to Tokyo, during which he tasted everything from olive-fed Wagyu to Kobe beef to Hokkaido Snow Beef.\n\nWhile the menu at Catch Steak includes an array of seafood dishes and sides, its steak selection is the showstopper: In addition to classic preparations of porterhouse and ribeye, it includes dry-aged options that are \u201ccave-aged in a 200-year-old box,\u201d alongside four American Wagyu options, and a selection of five by-the-ounce options of Japanese Wagyu, including a cut of \u201cTrue\u201d A5 Kobe beef for $45 an ounce. Catch Steak is now one of two restaurants in New York with an official Kobe license.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the idea of just walking in and getting your porterhouse for two is just no longer going to move the meter,\u201d says Birnbaum, adding that he wants to make the American steakhouse more approachable. \u201cSo, what is our alternative? It\u2019s getting steaks that we sourced not just from Japan, but also the greatest available to us in America\u2014small purveyors, small farms, super healthy organic types of steak.\u201d\n\nSo far, his approach to infuse his restaurants with inspiration from his travels is paying off. Catch is one of the most Instagrammed restaurants in the country, which Birnbaum sees as a marker of success.\n\n\u201cIt means that people are authentically taking photos of things that they want to be proud to show their friends and family and followers or whatever and tag us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t give them a dollar to do it, we didn\u2019t get them free food to do it\u2014they just naturally want to do it and that is an organic success.\u201d", "description": "The owners of the Catch restaurant group are trying to give the traditional steakhouse a glamorous makeover.", "authors": ["Anna Archibald"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569270941/190923-Rothbaum-Catch-tease_yqw3e1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
