Then try to stop your jaw hitting the floor as the Swedish teenage athlete Mondo Duplantis soars skyward, jackknifes his body, dances his hands up the pole, and flips \u2013 just! \u2013 over a height greater than a double decker bus. The new super slow-motion footage of his feat at the 2018 European championships in Berlin has been seen 4.5 million times on Twitter in the three weeks alone. The twist in the tail for athletics is that many viewers haven\u2019t the foggiest who Duplantis is.\n\nKatarina Johnson-Thompson goes to Doha on back of \u2018best run-in ever\u2019 Read more\n\nTherein lies the essential threat to track and field with the world championships about to start on Friday in Doha. No one doubts the stars are out there. The heptathlete Nafissatou Thiam is the most exceptional female athlete in any sport. Noah Lyles is the most charismatic sprinter since Usain Bolt. Dina Asher-Smith is a British talent for the ages. But young people increasingly prefer to gaze at other constellations.\n\nOne senior figure has warned me that athletics risks entering \u201ca death spiral\u201d where it becomes irrelevant except during Olympics, much like rowing and track cycling. I do not think that is quite right, given that the 2017 world championships in London and 2018 European championships in Berlin played to massive crowds. However the International Association of Athletics Federations president, Sebastian Coe, who will be re-elected unchallenged this week, knows the next four years could make or break his sport.\n\nHe will argue, with some justification, that athletics is in a better place now than when he took over in 2015, when revelations of state-sponsored Russian doping and IAAF corruption left it at rock bottom. Coe has not faced any accusations of wrongdoing, and those responsible have been banned. But during those first few months in charge, when he claimed journalists had \u201cdeclared war on my sport\u201d, refused to give up on a lucrative Nike contract, despite an obvious conflict of interest, and praised Lamine Diack as his \u201cspiritual leader\u201d just two months before his former boss was indicted on corruption charges, he did not always appear on the side of the angels.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Can the IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, discover the magical elixir to attract more youngsters to his sport? Photograph: Eric Gaillard/Reuters\n\nBut in 2016 Coe made one of the gutsiest decisions by a sports administrator in living memory by banning Russia\u2019s athletes from the Rio Olympics. He knew it would cost him influence and friendships in the International Olympic Committee, and that he would be left isolated, but he did it regardless because it was the right thing to do. He has since refused to allow Russia back in, despite considerable pressure, a decision that seems vindicated given reports that data from a Moscow drugs-testing lab was manipulated before being delivered to the World Anti-Doping Agency earlier this year.\n\nThat Coe acted so boldly came as a surprise because he appeared slow to appreciate the extent of Russian doping. Indeed in an infamous Channel 4 interview in November 2015, Jon Snow asked whether he was \u201casleep on the job or corrupt\u201d as the Pound report had confirmed stories of Russian doping which had been around when Coe was IAAF vice-president. As one well-placed source puts it: \u201cIt is ironic that since then he has ended up as the hardest-arsed federation head out there\u201d.\n\nKyle Langford\u2019s ability earns him world championships place, says Neil Black Read more\n\nThe Athletics Integrity Unit, set up by Coe to investigate and prosecute doping cases, has also bared its teeth more than expected, especially in Kenya. It is not perfect \u2013 the suspicion is too many cheats still prosper \u2013 but it is a notable statement of intent because exposing dopers is rarely good for business for a sport.\n\nCoe has also introduced several notable governance reforms, including introducing term limits and ensuring that by 2023 half of IAAF council members will be women. In the gangrenous world of international sport this is positively revolutionary.\n\nSure, the IAAF still has problems. Cash remains an issue, both for it and most athletes. However Coe\u2019s supporters point to the fact it could have been worse as several sponsors were close to quitting after some IAAF officials were banned for extorting money from the Russian runner Liliya Shobukhova to cover up anomalies in her blood passport.\n\nHiring Jon Ridgeon as chief executive should attract more blue-chip brands too. In a sport where, to quote the Clint Eastwood famous character Dirty Harry, \u201copinions are like arseholes \u2013 everyone has one\u201d, it is rare to find someone so widely liked and rated.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Despite the emergence of stars such as Dina Asher-Smith of Great Britain, athletics is failing to attract young people . Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images\n\nBut the question remains: can Coe, who will be 63 next Sunday and has been part of track and field\u2019s establishment for decades, discover the magical elixir to attract more youngsters to his sport? Last year parkrun crossed the five million barrier, while the London marathon ballot is always massively oversubscribed. The great paradox is that many of these runners do not consider themselves athletes or watch the sport.\n\nCasuals need to become converts. And not everyone is convinced that Coe\u2019s major announcement so far, to reduce every Diamond League event from two hours to 90 minutes, is the answer. That said, tentative plans to hold a Diamond League event on each Friday night in the summer \u2013 so fans know when to tune in \u2013 are widely supported.\n\nWhatever happens, the IAAF and TV must find ways to freshen up a broadcast format barely changed since the 1970s. With the help of one slow-motion camera, Duplantis\u2019s spectacular clearance went viral.
