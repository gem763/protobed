Schumer and Sen. Richard Durbin, his top lieutenant.\n\nTheir letter is the latest salvo in the ongoing battle over Mr. Trump\u2019s wall.\n\nWhen Congress allocated only a fraction of what he\u2019d asked for in fiscal year 2019, he proclaimed a border emergency and said that unlocked powers to move money around to build beyond what Congress approved.\n\nHe said he would shift about $6.1 billion from Pentagon accounts toward the wall.\n\nThe new shift would raise that total to $6.2 billion, the Democrats said.\n\nA federal judge last week ruled the president\u2019s emergency proclamation illegal. That judge is still deciding what to do about it.\n\nDemocrats, in their letter, said they were told the new money is needed because the administration is facing cost overruns from bureaucratic costs they didn\u2019t take into account when they laid their plans.\n\nDemocrats said they only learned about the shift \u2014 which they said is illegal \u2014 in an Oct. 8 briefing from the Pentagon.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
