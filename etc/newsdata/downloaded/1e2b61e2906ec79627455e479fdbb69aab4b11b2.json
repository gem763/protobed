He\u2019s become Trumpian in saying whatever sounds good at the moment. It\u2019s one thing when you\u2019re doing that on TV, it\u2019s another when you\u2019re under oath to a congressional committee.\u201d\n\nThe aide, however, said there\u2019s pressure on Graham to get more aggressive in response to the escalating tactics of House Democrats.\n\n\u201cIf the House isn\u2019t going to follow the norms of impeachment and do a vote and do legitimate live hearings then I think Graham is going to be more inclined to do some stunts,\u201d the aide said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGraham initially said he did not want to delve into the allegations being pushed by Giuliani, who claims that efforts to interfere in the 2016 election likely originated in Ukraine. He is also calling for an investigation into unsubstantiated allegations that Biden interfered in Ukrainian anti-corruption efforts.\n\nGraham told reporters before the two-week October recess that he didn\u2019t want to unleash a storm of partisan bickering by launching a Ukraine probe.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to turn the Senate into a circus,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do anything because we don\u2019t have any jurisdiction. I have no interest in opening up that front. I don\u2019t want to blow up the Senate.\u201d\n\nBut Graham, who has been in contact with Giuliani, abruptly shifted gears this past week, announcing he will now have Trump\u2019s personal lawyer testify.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very helpful because at the right time it will give me the opportunity to show all my evidence as if I were prosecuting a case. If they don\u2019t think they I have evidence, they don\u2019t me,\u201d Giuliani told The Hill in an interview Thursday.\n\nGiuliani called Graham \u201ca good friend of mine,\u201d saying he has talked to the South Carolina Republican, considered one of Trump\u2019s strongest Senate allies, about efforts to delve into the Ukraine controversy.\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, are itching to pounce on Giuliani if he comes up to Capitol Hill.

So I\u2019m trying to get them to come over here to get interviewed.\u201d\n\nDemocrats would undoubtedly challenge the credibility of Giuliani\u2019s witnesses, particularly in the wake of federal charges filed against two of his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who helped dig up information on Ukrainian corruption and potential links to Biden.\n\nUkrainian-born Parnas and Fruman, who was born in Belarus, were arrested Wednesday night at Dulles International Airport with one-way tickets out of the country. Both men are U.S. citizens.\n\nGiuliani suggested that Graham has also changed his mind on inviting Biden and his son Hunter to testify.\n\nBut the Senate Republican aide predicted that\u2019s unlikely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that Biden would be called. I think that\u2019s probably Giuliani more than Graham,\u201d the aide said.\n\nLaunching a Senate investigation into Ukrainian corruption and the Bidens could put vulnerable Republicans in a tough spot heading into 2020.\n\nSen.
