The hearing is testing evidence alleging that Ms Hutson arranged for G8 to fund another businessman, Nigel Elias, to acquire $8.5 million worth of shares in Affinity. Mr Elias has not been charged.\n\nThe court has heard allegations that Ms Hutson had implemented a \u201cdishonest scheme\u201d so it appeared G8 had lent money to another organisation, called Ingenious Communications. Ingenious would then allegedly pretended to onlend funds to Mr Elias\u2019s company.\n\nNeil Clelland, QC, representing Ms Hutson, argued his client had been charged for giving false evidence on the basis she gave a different version of events to Mr Elias, and any suggestion she was lying was to be \u201cproven by what Mr Elias says\u201d.\n\nBut Mr Bastianon maintained ASIC had relied on more than Mr Elias\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting at [Sydney\u2019s] Intercontinental Hotel, Mr Elias says that Ms Hutson handed over a loan agreement between Ingenious Communications and Nigel Elias. Nigel Elias says, \u2018I\u2019ve never seen that document before\u2019. He says it was handed to him by Ms Hutson at that meeting,\" Mr Bastianon said.\n\n\u201cMs Hutson, when we examined her, said, \u2018Yes I met with Mr Elias but I didn\u2019t hand over any of those documents, I know nothing about any loan agreement between Ingenious and Mr Elias. We talked about other matters.\u2019\n\n\u201cSubsequently \u2026 we found a copy of those documents at Ms Hutson's home when we executed a search warrant. Now that evidence supports Mr Elias's version of events, and rebuts Ms Hutson\u2019s.\u201d\n\nMr Clelland repeatedly quizzed Mr Bastianon on whether ASIC had used in mid-2016 its powerful Section 19 powers \u2013 under which people must answer questions even if they cannot be used in evidence against them \u2013 to try and figure out any defences she might have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs Hutson had just rejected a request to come in for an official interview, at which she could decline to answer questions. \u201cThe very next day she received a compulsory notice to undergo a section 19 examination,\u201d Mr Clelland said.\n\nHe aired in court an April email from Ms Bastianon, before the examination, which said: \u201cWe will need of course to examine Hutson and then review her evidence to see what holes need to be covered as a result of what we are told and to assess any possible defences.\u201d\n\nMr Bastianon denied ASIC had been trying to cover off any defences in a prosecution case, saying the regulator would want to know if there were any explanations consistent with innocence about the transactions.\n\nThe use of the examination power was proper and ASIC had not formed a final view about any prosecution of Ms Hutson then, he told court.\n\nMr Bastianon said ASIC had suspected Ms Hutson had committed an offence, and had evidence to recommend charges.\n\nExamination transcript contents were provided to prosecutors, he said.\n\nHe is on the stand on Friday with another ASIC investigator to be called.", "description": "But ASIC's use of compulsory interrogation powers is coming under the microscope in the hearing for star merchant banker Jenny Hutson.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6451%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_944%2C$y_145/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/373b6da6e85a461067e3dd9f362217ad2a6564ab", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
