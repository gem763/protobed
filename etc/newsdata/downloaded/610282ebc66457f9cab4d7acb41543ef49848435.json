Ken Buck: Trump impeachment inquiry deeply flawed and unfair \u2013 Hearings should be public", "language": "en", "text": "Until recently, the House Intelligence Committee occupied a unique space in Congress by avoiding partisanship and open acrimony. Members selected to sit on the committee were given the trust of overseeing our most secretive programs, access to the most classified information, and the responsibility of ensuring this information does not fall into the wrong hands.\n\nThe selection process for membership and the committee rules are also unique. The speaker of the House and the minority leader personally interview and select members. The committee meets behind closed doors and its deliberations are rarely discussed in public.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee is the last committee that should conduct an impeachment proceeding. Impeachment should be based on a fair process. Fairness requires open proceedings so that the public can evaluate the demeanor and credibility of each witness.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS BLAST DEMS FOR WITHHOLDING IMPEACHMENT DOCS, DEMAND ACCESS TO RECORDS\n\nUsing secretive proceedings to investigate the president invites distrust that will further divide our country.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has weaponized the Intelligence Committee. In the process, she has ruined the last vestige of bipartisan cooperation on Capitol Hill. Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is the least likely member to lead a credible investigation. He has consistently exploited the trust of his position for partisan purposes.\n\nSchiff said this year that \u201cthere\u2019s clear evidence on the issue of collusion\u201d between the Trump election campaign and Russia in the 2016 presidential election. Last year, Schiff said President Trump \u201cmay be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.\u201d\n\nSCHIFF ADMITS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 'MUCH MORE CLEAR' ABOUT CONTACT WITH WHISTLEBLOWER\n\nOf course, the American people now know that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation concluded there was no collusion between Trump or his campaign and Russia.\n\nShortly after the existence of an intelligence whistleblower complaint that raised concerns about a phone call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine became public, Schiff stated that neither he nor his staff had contact with the whistleblower prior to the filing of the complaint.\n\nBut we now know that Schiff\u2019s staff had previously interviewed the whistleblower. This has caused many to question whether Schiff\u2019s staff coached the whistleblower.\n\nSchiff is now engaged in impeachment hearings, questioning witnesses behind closed doors. In a total lack of transparency \u2013 and contrary to every prior instance involving presidential impeachment \u2013 this process is occurring outside of the full view of the American people.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nDemocrats are selectively disseminating information from these closed-door proceedings to unfairly characterize President Trump\u2019s actions. This is occurring before witness transcripts can be released to the public to put these statements in proper context.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee\u2019s special status in Congress enabling it to operate outside of public scrutiny was never meant to be used to manipulate public opinion.\n\nThe American people deserve better. If Democrats want to engage in a legitimate impeachment inquiry, the House should follow precedent and immediately hold a vote to authorize an inquiry.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe investigation should allow the president\u2019s counsel to assert relevant privileges, encourage the minority to call witnesses, and protect due process by being fully transparent and open to the public.\n\nAnything less will prove the partisan nature of this impeachment and will do great damage to the integrity of the Intelligence Committee and America\u2019s long-term national security interests.", "description": "Rep.
