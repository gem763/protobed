Angus King, Maine independent.\n\nChina has attacked the legislation as unacceptable interference in its domestic affairs.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry Hua Chunying told reporters Tuesday that foreign nations to \u201cpull out their dirty hands from Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong, which have turned violent on several occasions, began in earnest in June when Hong Kong\u2019s Beijing-appointed city administrator pushed an extradition bill \u2014 since withdrawn \u2014 that critics said would put residents of Hong Kong at risk of being sent to China, where they could face justice in the mainland\u2019s legal system.\n\nBut the demonstrations quickly took on a wider scope, with demands for free elections and greater civil liberties.\n\nThe situation escalated last month when Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered military forces to begin massing near the mainland\u2019s border with Hong Kong. The move sparked fears of a crackdown akin to the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square.\n\nIn a separate briefing Tuesday afternoon in Washington, additional Hong Kong activists offered first-hand accounts of what protesters on the front lines have been facing since June. The activists concealed their identities and covered their faces in masks, goggles, sunglasses and yellow construction hats for fear they would face punishment upon their return to Hong Kong.\n\nOne activist, who requested only to be named as \u201cLV,\u201d said she has witnessed \u201cemotionally charged police using excessive force, brutally beating the heads of those who have already surrendered with batons.\u201d\n\nAt the conversation hosted by Freedom House, a pro-democracy watchdog organization, LV explained that her \u201cbiggest fear on the front line is seeing my fellow protesters fallen \u2026 and beaten, but I have to abandon them and keep running so I won\u2019t be caught also.\u201d\n\n\u201cOtherwise,\u201d she added, \u201cthere would be one less person less in the next protest.\u201d\n\nNathan Law, a 26-year-old activist and a founder of the Demosisto party, said the Hong Kong police use excessive force because the Chinese government \u201cgrants them the permission.\u201d\n\nMr. Law, who has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, warned that \u201cif [authoritarianism] prevails, \u2026 then what is happening to Hong Kong is exactly what [will] happen to the world.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
