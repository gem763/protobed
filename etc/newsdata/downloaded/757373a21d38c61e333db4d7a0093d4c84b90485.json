The Battle Axe Culture is named after the battle axe that was buried with the remains of a man, a woman and a child. A dog was also buried at the Linkoping burial site.\n\nA study on the research has been published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\n\n1,100-YEAR-OLD VIKING TREASURE REVEALS ITS SECRETS\n\nThe Battle Axe Culture dates back around 5,000 years and is said to resemble another ancient group of people, the European Corded Ware Culture, named for the cord-like designs on its pottery.\n\nUsing genomic sequencing, the Linkoping bones were compared to the remains of other prehistoric individuals from what are now Sweden, Estonia and Poland. The Scandinavian Battle Axe Culture was found to share a common genetic ancestry with the European Corded Ware Culture.\n\n\"This suggests that the introduction of this new cultural manifestation was associated with movements of people,\u201d said Torsten G\u00fcnther, a population geneticist at Sweden\u2019s Uppsala University, and co-author of the study, in the statement. \u201cThese groups have a history which we ultimately can trace back to the Pontic Steppe north of the Black Sea.\"\n\n'SENSATIONAL' VIKING BOAT GRAVES DISCOVERED\n\nExperts from Stockholm University and Sweden's Ostrgotlands Museum also participated in the research. \u201cThe collaboration of archaeologists with geneticists allows us to understand more about these people as individuals as well as where their ancestors came from,\" said the study\u2019s lead author, Helena Malmstr\u00f6m, an archaeogeneticist at Uppsala University, in the statement.\n\nScandinavia continues to reveal new aspects of its rich history. Two Viking boat graves were also recently uncovered in Sweden in what archaeologists are describing as a \u201csensational\u201d discovery. In another project, an incredible Swedish grave containing the skeleton of a Viking warrior, long thought to be male, was recently confirmed as female. Last year, a Viking \u201cThor\u2019s hammer\u201d was discovered in Iceland and archaeologists in Norway used ground-penetrating radar technology to reveal an extremely rare Viking longship.\n\nFEMALE VIKING WARRIOR'S REMARKABLE GRAVE SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON ANCIENT SOCIETY\n\nAlso in 2018, an 8-year-old girl discovered a 1,500-year-old sword in a Swedish lake and an incredible trove of silver treasure linked to the era of a famous Viking king was discovered on an island in the Baltic Sea. Hundreds of 1,000-year-old silver coins, rings, pearls, and bracelets were found on the German island of Ruegen.\n\nIn 2017, an incredibly well-preserved Viking sword was found by a reindeer hunter on a remote mountain in southern Norway. In 2016, archaeologists in Trondheim, Norway, unearthed the church where Viking King Olaf Haraldsson was first enshrined as a saint.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nSeparately in 2016, a tiny Viking crucifix was found in Denmark.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "An international team of researchers is shedding new light on the mysterious ancient \u201cBattle Axe Culture\u201d of Scandinavia.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/BattleAxSkeleton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
