Pictured are Hong Kong police chasing a couple wearing face masks\n\nProtests have become increasingly more violent in Hong Kong, as demonstrators continue to start fires in train stations and wreck shops.\n\nThe protests on Friday erupted hours after Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam invoked colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years to ban the face masks demonstrators use to hide their identities.\n\nBeijing-backed Lam said the night's 'extreme violence' justified the use of the emergency law.\n\n'The radical behavior of rioters took Hong Kong through a very dark night, leaving society today half-paralyzed,' she said in pre-recorded remarks.\n\nCarrie Lam said: 'The extreme actions of rioters created a very dark night for Hong Kong and made Hong Kong society semi-paralysed today.'

Lam announced a ban on face masks using a colonial-era emergency powers\n\nBut undeterred by the ban and transport shutdown, several hundred pro-democracy protesters, many wearing masks, took to the streets yesterday, marching through the normally bustling central district of Causeway Bay.\n\nShouting 'Wearing mask is not a crime,' tens of thousands of protesters braved the rain today to march in central Hong Kong as a court rejected a second legal attempt to block the mask ban.\n\nLawmaker Dennis Kwok said the High Court refused to grant an injunction on the mask ban, but it agreed to discuss it later this month.\n\nMany malls, shops and the entire MTR network of subways and trains shut yesterday following the overnight rampage.\n\nAbout half of the city's 94 subway stations reopened today but many malls, especially in the Causeway Bay shopping district, remained shuttered as thousands of protesters marched with umbrellas while wearing face masks.\n\nA protester throws back a teargas cannister towards police during a demonstration in the Wanchai district\n\nPeople protest a government ban on face masks in Kowloon while wearing V for Vendetta masks that are commonly worn by activist group Anonymous\n\nProtesters started throwing tear gas back at police during the protests today\n\nPolice in full protective gear gather near a streetcar stop in Hong Kong today after a night of chaos caused by ongoing riots\n\nCritics fear the use of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance that gives Lam broad powers to implement any measures she deems necessary in an emergency would pave the way for more draconian regulations. The law was enacted by British colonial rulers in 1922 to quell a seamen's strike and last used in 1967 to crush riots.\n\nLam has not ruled out further measures if violence continues.\n\n'This emergency law is so ancient and draconian. Carrie Lam is using it as some sort of weapon of mass destruction to nuke Hong Kong,' said legislator Claudia Mo.\n\nThe protest movement started in June over a now abandoned bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited for trial in mainland China.\n\nBut it has now become an anti-China movement as protesters demand more democratic rights, including direct elections for the city's leader and police accountability.\n\nThe unrest has plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis since its handover from Britain to China in 1997 under a one country, two systems formula that granted it autonomy and broad freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nA western woman reacts after teargas was fired by police during a demonstration in the Wanchai district\n\nA bloodied taxi driver receives medical assistance after he smashed his taxi along Cheung Sha Wan Road during a demonstration today\n\nPolice arrive as protestors burn rubbish and old crates to block traffic\n\n'We're not sure what is going to happen later, but we felt we had to get out and show our basic right to wear a mask,' said one protester, Sue, 22, who wore a black mask and dark glasses to the Causeway Bay march\n\nPolice fire from the Mongkok police station toward protesters after they marched from the Tsim Sha Tsui district to Mongkok today\n\nProtestors make fire to block traffic in Hong Kong while shouting 'Wearing mask is not a crime'", "description": "Lau Chak-Kei, 46, has been nicknamed Bald Lau Sir by his 774,000 followers on China's most popular social media site - Weibo.
