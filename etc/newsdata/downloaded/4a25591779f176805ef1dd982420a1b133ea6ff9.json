Hours later, federal police raided Novaestrat's office, which also served as the home of Novaestrat general manager William Roberto G..\n\nAuthorities seized computer equipment from the executive's home, and took the Novaestrat executive under custody a few hours later, across the country, in Ecuador's Esmeraldas region, according to a tweet from Mar\u00eda Paula Romo, Ecuador's Interior Minister.\n\nEsta tarde / noche la @PoliciaEcuador realiz\u00f3 el allanamiento del local se\u00f1alado como domicilio de #Novaestrat que es adem\u00e1s el domicilio de uno de sus directivos.\n\n\n\nAllanamiento se hizo con orden de juez en el marco de la investigaci\u00f3n que conduce @FiscaliaEcuador pic.twitter.com/toD79a1FDO \u2014 Mar\u00eda Paula Romo (@mariapaularomo) September 17, 2019\n\nHace pocos minutos @PoliciaEcuador retuvo, en la provincia de Esmeraldas, al se\u00f1or William Roberto G.\n\n\n\nGerente de #Novaestrat\n\n\n\nSer\u00e1 trasladado de inmediato para que @FiscaliaEcuador pueda recabar informaci\u00f3n en el marco de la investigaci\u00f3n que realiza. \u2014 Mar\u00eda Paula Romo (@mariapaularomo) September 17, 2019\n\nThe State Attorney General's Office later confirmed Romo's social media posts.\n\nNew privacy law\n\nBut the massive privacy breach also served as a wake-up call for the local government. In the aftermath of the breach, Ecuador's president asked government officials to expedite the process of passing a new data privacy law.\n\nIn a statement on the Ministry of Telecommunications website, Telecommunications Minister Andres Michelena Ayala confirmed that his ministry would comply with the president's request, and submit a new law to the parliament in the next three days.\n\nMichelena said his office has been working on the new data privacy law for the past eight months.", "description": "Ecuador police arrest director of data analytics firm that leaked the personal records of most of Ecuador's population.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/17/71996cb9-8a95-41cd-afaf-463660269e9a/thumbnail/770x578/a404caf768b8b8ae8057ea3560bdd752/ecuador-data-breach.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
