In fact it was an historic amount of intensification in such a short time.\n\n\u201cThis only happens when all the right ingredients are in place. Like if you had a fire and instead of throwing gasoline on it to make it bigger you also grabbed some lighter fluid, a bit of oil and a couple of aerosol cans for good measure.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nJapan\u2019s Meteorological Agency has given the storm its highest classification of \u201cviolent\u201d.\n\nIt is the first to hit the country since Faxai struck hours before England arrived last month, killing three and injuring 40. Tournament chiefs are expected to issue a statement updating the situation later today.\n\nIt is thought they are considering moving the match to Oita, 600 miles to the south.\n\nEddie Jones\u2019 squad refuse to be distracted by the potential for disruption, preparing as if Le Crunch will go ahead as scheduled in Yokohama this Saturday at 9.15am UK.\n\nDefence coach John Mitchell said: \u201cOne thing we really pride ourselves on in all our preparation is to be adaptable and flexible for anything that may throw us off.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day we are looking forward to playing France wherever that may be. Our preparation is totally focused and at the end of the day we don\u2019t let that noise enter our preparation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting rain but if we don\u2019t get rain we\u2019ll deal with it. We haven\u2019t had a lot of rain in the last few months so it will be quite nice to feel like home!\u201d\n\nOwen Farrell and Luke Cowan-Dickie returned to training on Wednesday after recovering from stomach bugs. Billy Vunipola, Joe Marler and Jack Nowell were missing. Eddie Jones names his side tomorrow.", "description": "The Red Rose are scheduled to meet the French in Yokohama, Japan on Saturday", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19927049.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JAPAN-WEATHER-TYPHOON.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
