Strained eyes \u2014 50 per cent Sore back \u2014 49 per cent Headaches \u2014 48 per cent Stiff neck \u2014 45 per cent Sore wrists \u2014 30 per cent Sore bum \u2014 23 per cent Stiff legs \u2014 23 per cent Sore legs \u2014 18 per cent Swollen legs \u2014 15 per cent Sore ankle \u2014 13 per cent 45 per cent of workers surveyed reported suffering from stiff necks\n\nBehavioural Futurist William Higham and a team of experts from the fields of ergonomics, occupational health and professional well-being set out to investigate the effects that office workplaces are having on employee health.\n\nBased on surveys of more than 3,000 workers in France, Germany and the UK, the team predicted how offices might change the human body over the next 20 years.\n\nFrom their findings, the researchers teamed up with model specialists Helix 3D Ltd to create 'Emma' \u2014 a disturbingly distorted life-sized mannequin to illustrate the potential impact of modern workstations on our bodies.\n\nPoor Emma has a permanently hunched posture sitting for hours every day over her desk, dry red eyes from prolonged exposure to a computer screen and sallow skin for spending years trapped under the glare of artificial light.\n\n'The Work Colleague of the Future report shows that employers and workers really need to act now and address the problem of poor workplace health,' said Mr Higham.\n\n'Unless we make radical changes to our working lives, such as moving more, addressing our posture at our desks, taking regular walking breaks or considering improving our workstation setup, our offices are going to make us very sick.'\n\n'As a result, workers in the future could suffer health problems as bad as those we thought we\u2019d left behind in the Industrial Revolution.'\n\nThe researchers found that office workers spend an average of six hours sitting at a desk each day.\n\nMore than 90 per cent of those surveyed reported being concerned that this was too much time \u2014 and 98 per cent fearing such could lead to future health problems.\n\nIn the UK, the team found that 90 per cent of office workers reported experiencing health issues that reduced their productivity and almost half suffer from eye strain, sore backs and headaches caused by their workspace.\n\nWork-related sick days cost the economy \u00a377 billion every year.\n\nFurthermore, seven out of ten workers reported turning to medications to combat these problems.\n\n'Emma' \u2014 the sickly work colleague of the future \u2014 is a life-sized dummy built to show how sitting all day at ergonomically-unfriendly desk might affect workers\n\nWHAT ARE EMMA'S AFFLICTIONS? Emma \u2014 the office worker of the future \u2014 suffers from various health issues, which include: A permanently bent back Caused by sitting for hours with a posture. Varicose veins Brought about by poor blood flow. A rotund stomach Caused by sedentary working. Dry, red eyes From long hours staring at a computer screen. Swollen wrists and ankles Caused by repetitive movements. Sallow skin From years under artificial lighting. Red upper arms Brought about by regular contact with laptop heat. Eczema Caused by stress at work. A hairy nose and ears, as well as a swollen nose All triggered by poor air quality.

One way to get people moving and reducing the time they sit for is consider more ergonomic furniture in the workplace, such as sit stand desks.'\n\nThese, he added, can help to prevent workers from developing long-term health conditions.", "description": "'Emma' - the sickly work colleague of the future - is a life-sized dummy built to show how sitting all day at ergonomically-unfriendly desk might affect workers.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/02/20111420-0-image-a-24_1571879089006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
