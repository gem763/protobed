Defeat in the South Atlantic would have been a disaster but would not have left Britain a permanent colony of an EU that despises it.\u201d\n\nAbbott defended the analogy between Brexit and war, by suggesting that \u201ca collapse of self-confidence or a failure of will in a great matter could be scarcely less deadly\u201d than war.\n\n\u201cThe impact on the wider world of a much-diminished Britain, humiliated, and stuck half-in juridically but half-out spiritually of a gloating EU should not be underestimated.\u201d", "description": "Former Australian prime minister says a Brexit defeat for Britain would be akin to losing the Falklands war", "authors": ["Paul Karp"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c6e5f1700534815e1a7a04e686f6bad7b300084/2382_148_2737_1643/master/2737.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eddd4da27a5a15a80483daf63046df85", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
