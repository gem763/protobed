Wales' Tomos Williams scores their third try REUTERS/Edgar Su\n\nWales clung to an eight-point lead with seven minutes left until a strong carry by Leigh Halfpenny scattered the Uruguayan defence and opened up a hole for Tomos Williams to settle the matter with the bonus-point try.\n\nWales also scored tries from Nicky Smith, Josh Adams, Gareth Davies and a penalty try but coach Warren Gatland was a picture of discontent for much of the evening.\n\nHis team were denied four tries, including two from forward passes, and committed a slew of handling errors on a perfect night for rugby.\n\n\u201cWe know we have to do a lot better than that. But we have to be happy that we came away with a bonus-point win,\u201d said flanker Justin Tipuric, who led the side for the first time in place of regular rested skipper Alun Wyn Jones.\n\n\u201cYou have to give Uruguay credit.
