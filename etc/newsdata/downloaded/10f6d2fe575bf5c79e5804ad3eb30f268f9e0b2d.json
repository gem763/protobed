My dad is worried that I might get injured but I know my limits\u2019\n\nGlenn\n\nI\u2019ve been Luke\u2019s sole carer since he was a toddler. His mother and I didn\u2019t live together, and she died in 2014, so it\u2019s been a struggle.\n\nWhen he was about seven we were at an arcade and he dropped a coin on the floor but couldn\u2019t find it to pick it up. That\u2019s when we started to find out he had a sight condition (retinitis pigmentosa). It wasn\u2019t a total surprise because RP is in the family on his mother\u2019s side.\n\nNow he accepts it, but when he was diagnosed at 10 he refused to. He only recently agreed to having a teaching assistant with one-to-one learning. He has a white stick but never uses it.\n\nMany a time I\u2019ve told him off for knocking things over \u2013 you forget. Five minutes later, I\u2019m apologising for flaring up. There\u2019s minimal furniture so he can move around OK, and I\u2019ve also had the house steps painted white on the edge.\n\nLuke\n\nI don\u2019t really identify as visually impaired. It\u2019s not a big part of my life and I don\u2019t want to be told I\u2019m limited. I don\u2019t use a stick or have a guide dog. My dad is worried that I might get injured but I\u2019ve developed coping mechanisms and know my limits.\n\nHow we live together: the family and the \u2018granny au pair\u2019 Read more\n\nThe effect of my condition is worse at night. I tend to look at the ground to use my peripheral vision, but sometimes walk into posts. I usually hold on to someone\u2019s arm at night, but I find that a bit embarrassing.\n\nI do a lot of volunteering \u2013 my local athletics club, the National Citizen Service, the local youth council. Guide Dogs has really helped. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be volunteering without them, they\u2019ve acted as a great motivator.\n\n\u2022 If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
