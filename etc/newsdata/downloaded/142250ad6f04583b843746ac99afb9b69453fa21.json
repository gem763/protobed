It is accredited by the Complementary Medical Association, meaning therapists completing the course should be able to get insurance to treat cancer patients.\n\nThe Made For Life charity is running a new course which teaches a 'featherlight' method of massage and warns teachers what areas to avoid. Stock picture\n\n\u2018For years, therapists were told they couldn\u2019t massage anyone who had cancer,\u2019 says Marc.\n\n\u2018The fear was that, as massage speeds up circulation and blood flow, and cancer cells develop in the blood, it would spread cancer. It was well-meaning, but incorrect \u2014 there is no evidence to corroborate this.\n\n\u2018Yet, until recently, up to 90 per cent of spas and beauty salons still turned cancer patients away, citing insurance or health reasons.\u2019\n\nThe emotional impact of this on patients can be huge. \u2018I\u2019ve seen it time and time again. Patients get angry and upset \u2014 they can\u2019t understand why,\u2019 says Marc, who was an NHS paramedic for 23 years.\n\nProfessor Kefah Mokbel, lead oncoplastic breast surgeon at The London Breast Institute, agrees: \u2018Patients tell me they feel humiliated and discriminated against. These negative emotions are very unhelpful to women with a history of breast cancer who are doing their best to move forward and develop a positive mindset.\u2019\n\nHowever, massage does bring benefits. A study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine in 2013 found that massages not only improved quality of life for patients with advanced cancer, but also reduced pain and improved sleep.\n\nOf course, there are important factors that need to be taken into consideration. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can make the skin more sensitive, so harsh scrubs should be avoided, and, if the lymph nodes (part of the body\u2019s immune system) have been removed, then putting pressure on those areas can increase the risk of lymphoedema (swelling), which can be serious and incurable.\n\nA 2013 study found that massages not only improved quality of life for patients with advanced cancer, but also reduced pain and improved sleep\n\n\u2018Instead, we provide adapted techniques to make it safe, such as lighter touch massage,\u2019 says Marc.\n\n\u2018Deep tissue massage is also not advisable because patients tend to bruise more easily after chemotherapy, as the treatment can affect the bone marrow where platelets are produced that stop bleeding.\u2019\n\nExtra care also needs to be taken to prevent the risk of infection.\n\n\u2018This means that manicures and pedicures, which might seem innocuous and were, for years, the failsafe option for cancer patients, may not be a good idea for those whose immune system is compromised, in case the skin is broken and gets infected,\u2019 adds Marc.\n\n\u2018But, as long as the therapist has been properly trained, there is no reason patients with cancer can\u2019t have therapies, and they don\u2019t need a doctor\u2019s letter to go ahead.\u2019\n\nThe best therapies for cancer patients are light touch massage and facials that \u2018use the power of gentle stroking techniques, slow movements of the fingers and the flat of the hand without applying as much pressure as a traditional massage\u2019, he explains.\n\nNicky Howarth, 52, an administrator from Coventry, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016 and had a double mastectomy last year, was a masseuse before her diagnosis, so was well aware of the concerns. It was the offer of a free massage through a Facebook cancer support group that introduced her to light touch therapy.\n\n\u2018It was like a tickling, with very little pressure,\u2019 she says. \u2018It took until my third or fourth massage to understand what it was all about \u2014 it is as much the emotional effect as the physical touch \u2014 and I am now a massive advocate.\u2019\n\n\u2018Massage makes you feel better,\u2019 adds Professor Mokbel. \u2018I\u2019d like to see oncology massage programmes offered at more cancer treatment centres in the UK.\u2019", "description": "The Made For Life charity is running a new course which teaches a 'featherlight' method of massage and warns teachers what areas to avoid.", "authors": ["Rachel Ellis For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/19716530-0-image-a-4_1571096727349.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
