Gavin Newsom last week alleging waste left by the homeless in big cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles was being improperly handled.\n\nMayor London Breed said the violation notice contains \u201cmischaracterizations, inaccuracies and falsehoods\u201d and the city\u2019s sewer system is one of the most effective in the country.\n\n\u201cNo debris flow out into the (San Francisco) Bay or the ocean,\u201d Breed said in a statement, adding that San Francisco has a multibillion-dollar program to upgrade its sewage treatment system.\n\n\u201cThe same Trump EPA that is dismantling environmental protections around the country is now making fraudulent claims about San Francisco\u2019s combined sewer system,\u201d state Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, said in a statement. He called the notice \u201ca fraudulent political attack on San Francisco by a collapsing administration desperate to rile up its base.\u201d\n\nThe EPA notice contained a veiled warning that it retains the option of seeking fines and penalties through administrative, civil or criminal actions over the violations.\n\nWheeler\u2019s letter to the governor last week didn\u2019t lay out any specifics on possible disciplinary actions, although they could include withholding funds or revoking California\u2019s authority to administer federal laws such as the Clean Water Act. The latter would seem highly unlikely, however, because EPA would have to assume the expense of running the programs itself.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Trump administration ratcheted up its feud with California on Wednesday as the Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice accusing San Francisco of violating the federal Clean Water Act.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
