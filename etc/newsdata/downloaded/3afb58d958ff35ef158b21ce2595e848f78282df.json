Machu Picchu is a 15th century Incan citadel, believed to have been built for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438\u201372). It is located in modern-day Peru's Cusco region, on a 7,970 feet (2,430 metre) -long mountain ridge. It was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. The site was abandoned during the time of the Spanish conquest, but was not discovered by the invading forces. Geological analysis has suggested that the citadel's location above a network of intersecting tectonic faults was deliberately chosen. These would have provided an abundance of easy-to-work rock as well as a source of water and drainage.\n\nGeologist Rualdo Menegat of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil combined satellite images of Machu Picchu with field measurements to map out the fractures and faults that underlie the famous UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nHe found that these tectonic features come in various sizes at the site \u2014 ranging from tiny fractures visible in individual blocks of rock to massive-scale faults.\n\nThe latter reach up to 109 miles (175 kilometres) in length and have determined the layout of some of the river valleys that cross the region around the Incan citadel.\n\nSome of the faults were created by the tectonic activity which lifted up the Central Andes Mountains across the last eight million years.\n\nDr Menegat found that these features appear in several sets \u2014 with some running in a northeast\u2013southwest direction and others northwest\u2013southeast.\n\nTogether, these lines intersect beneath Machu Picchu, creating an 'X' shape.\n\nDr Menegat also found that the citadel's urban sectors, individuals buildings, stair and surrounding agricultural fields were also all aligned with these major faults.\n\n'The layout clearly reflects the fracture matrix underlying the site,' said Dr Menegat, who added that other Incan cities are also built on the intersection of faults.\n\nThese include Cusco, Ollantaytambo and Pisac.\n\n'Each is precisely the expression of the main directions of the site's geological faults,' he added.\n\nFurthermore, Dr Menegat believes that the underlying network of faults and fractures were integral to the construction of Machu Picchu itself.\n\n\n\n'The intense fracturing there predisposed the rocks to breaking along these same planes of weakness, which greatly reduced the energy needed to carve them.'\n\nDr Menegat found that these features appear in several sets \u2014 with some running in a northeast\u2013southwest direction and others northwest\u2013southeast. Together, these lines intersect beneath Machu Picchu, creating an 'X' shape\n\n'The layout clearly reflects the fracture matrix underlying the site,' said Dr Menegat, who added that other Incan cities are also built on the intersection of faults\n\nIncan stonework is legendary \u2014 the blocks were put together without mortar so perfectly that it is impossible to even slide a credit card between them. Pictured, a wall in Ollantaytambo\n\nThe Incas would have taken advantage of this abundance of easily workable building materials, Menegat said.\n\nMachu Picchu's stonework is legendary \u2014 the blocks were put together without mortar so perfectly that it is impossible to even slide a credit card between them.\n\n'Machu Picchu's location is not a coincidence,' said Dr Menegat.\n\n'It would be impossible to build such a site in the high mountains if the substrate was not fractured.'\n\nThe web of faults beneath Machu Picchu likely furnished the Incan people with other benefits as well, Dr Menegat said \u2014 with a water supply being the most beneficial.\n\n'The area's tectonic faults channelled meltwater and rainwater straight to the site,' he added.\n\nFurthermore, Dr Menegat believes that the underlying network of faults and fractures were integral to the construction of Machu Picchu itself\n\nThe setting of the 569-year-old city would have provided an abundance of easy-to-work building stone that was predisposed to fracturing in the direction of the faults\n\nAnother advantage in building at the Machu Picchu site would have come from how the citadel's high perch effectively isolated it from avalanches and landslides.\n\nThese, Dr Menegat explained, are common hazards in this alpine setting.\n\nAlongside this, the fractures beneath the citadel would have helped to drain the settlement during the intense rainstorms which frequently hit the region.\n\n'About two-thirds of the effort to build the sanctuary involved constructing subsurface drainage,' said Dr Menegat.\n\n'The preexisting fractures aided this process and help account for its remarkable preservation.'\n\n'Machu Picchu clearly shows us that the Incan civilisation was an empire of fractured rocks.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were presented on September 23 during the 2019 annual meeting of the Geological Society of America held in Phoenix, Arizona.", "description": "Geologist Rualdo Menegat combined satellite images of the Machu Picchu site in Peru with field measurements to map out the faults that underlie the famous UNESCO World Heritage Site.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/15/18920624-0-image-a-17_1569420589046.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
