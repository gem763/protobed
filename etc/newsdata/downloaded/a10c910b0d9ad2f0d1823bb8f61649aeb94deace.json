Her talkshow is based in the city.\n\nMeanwhile Wendy has spoken out about the split to say she won't stay single for long, as she intends to get married again.\n\nSpeaking to Dr. Mehmet Oz on his talk show last month Wendy said: 'I say this all the time. I'm a wife. I'm not a girlfriend and I will get married again.\n\nFormer home: The Livingston, New Jersey house the couple previously shared is currently listed for sale at $1,895,000, more than $200,000 less than the couple paid for it\n\n'There will be a prenuptial agreement, and by the way, Mehmet, we will not be living in the same house.'\n\nWendy insisted her next marriage will be 'under new circumstances', as she wants to keep living separately from her future spouse, whom she says must have 'a full career and his own money'.\n\nShe added: 'Marriage under new circumstance, that's it. That freedom of turning that key, or electing like, \"All right. Let's stay at your place tonight. Let's stay at my place tonight ... But ... you buy the third place. How about that?\"\n\n'I need a man with a full career and his own money and his own situation. I don't want anything from you, except your love and respect. And don't ask anything of me.'\n\nAs they were: Wendy and her husband of 12 years are seen in 2018\n\nMeanwhile, the Wendy Williams Show host recently said she was seeing 'many men' in the wake of her divorce.\n\nShe said: 'I see many men. The youngest would be, like, 48. The oldest would be 65.'\n\nAnd the star previously admitted it was fathering a child with another woman that was the last straw for her in her split from Kevin.\n\nShe said: 'Infidelity is one thing, a full baby is a whole other topic. It's now time for me to move on with my life ... I'm not changing Pampers, I want to be pampered! If we don't laugh, then we'll cry.\n\n'So, I've learned how to, from my mother, how to make lemons into lemonade. What am I supposed to do? Stay in the house and cry all day?'", "description": "Wendy Williams has paid her ex Kevin Hunter $250,000 towards his new living arrangements, as the pair's divorce moves forward.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/18/19264460-0-image-a-20_1570123695796.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
