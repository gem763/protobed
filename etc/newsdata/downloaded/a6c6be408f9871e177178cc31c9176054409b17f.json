But most ignore another type of fund that trades on exchanges\u2014closed-end mutual funds. Is that a mistake?\n\nThat depends on an investor\u2019s goals and risk tolerance. The massive move into ETFs has been driven largely by low fees and a growing acceptance of the idea that a fund that aims to match the performance of a market index is likely to do better in the long run than an actively managed fund that tries to outperform the market.\n\nBut for investors who want more than a market-tracking return and are willing to pay for the chance to get it\u2014both in higher fees and heightened risk\u2014closed-end funds are an option.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the key advantages and disadvantages of each:\n\nThe case for ETFs\n\nAmong the thousands of ETFs, most track the performance of a major market index. For instance, an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 index includes in its holdings all of the stocks listed in that index.\n\nThese funds follow their benchmark wherever it goes\u2014up or down. So, regardless of gains or losses among the fund\u2019s holdings, it doesn\u2019t trade the shares it owns, and it doesn\u2019t rebalance its assets unless a stock is added to or removed from the index.\n\nBecause of this passive management, ETFs generally execute fewer trades than mutual funds, and their operating expenses are correspondingly lower. As a result, their expense ratio\u2014the amount that shareholders pay annually for expenses and management fees\u2014is also lower. (The expense ratio of an ETF or a closed-end fund can be found in the fund\u2019s prospectus.)\n\nThere are also tax advantages to an ETF. \u201cSince passive ETFs are not constantly buying and selling, there are fewer tax consequences than you would have with a closed-end fund,\u201d says Joel Isaacson, president of Joel Isaacson & Co., a financial and tax planning company in New York. \u201cYou don\u2019t have regular capital-gain distributions at the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThe case for closed-ends\n\nClosed-end funds, or CEFs, typically have a portfolio of stocks, bonds or other securities in a particular industry, country or region. There are now more than 500 available.\n\nClosed-end funds are actively managed in an effort to generate higher returns than market indexes, But that means they usually have higher trading costs than ETFs and so higher expense ratios.\n\nUnlike ETFs, closed-end funds tend to trade at a discount or premium to net asset value, based on demand from investors. In other words, the price of the fund\u2019s shares may be substantially different from the per-share value of the securities held by the fund. If there is more selling pressure, the fund will trade at a discount; if there is more buying pressure, the fund will trade at a premium.\n\nWhen a closed-end fund trades at a discount, as a majority of them do, a possibility for profit exists if the gap between the share price and the net asset value narrows. The larger the gap, the greater the likelihood that the current discount will shrink over time to the fund\u2019s average one-year discount since its start. But it\u2019s not a sure thing. Discounts\u2014and premiums\u2014can move in unpredictable ways.\n\nClosed-end funds sometimes use leverage\u2014borrowing to buy additional shares. That can raise their dividend yield, but it also tends to amplify movement in their share price in both directions.\n\nIt all adds up to greater risk for the possibility of greater reward.\n\nMr. Sloane is a writer in New York.
