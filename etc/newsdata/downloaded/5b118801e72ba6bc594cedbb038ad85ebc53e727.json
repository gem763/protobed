Photo: Christian Vierig/Getty Images\n\nMy first encounter with Rent the Runway came with prom 2013, when I wore a pale pink dress by Catherine Deane. At the time, it felt elegant as hell, but my current boss recently said it made me look like a Fox News anchor. As a teen in Dallas, that wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing (though I can\u2019t say the same for the belief system that went with it). But as I grew older, wiser, and capable of leaving Lilly Pulitzer behind, I forgot all about RTR.\n\nBut now! I\u2019m reluctant to write this for the same reason that people don\u2019t want to give out the name of their favorite local restaurant, but I feel I must: Rent the Runway has amazing clothes \u2014 the kind that will appeal to even the most cynical fashion snobs.\n\nMy revelation occurred on a July evening. I needed a dress to wear to a fancy work event that was taking place outdoors, in a heat wave. A friend was using Rent the Runway for the summer, and on her account I saw the perfect dress, from the extremely stylish brand Khaite. I was verklempt: Khaite, on Rent the Runway? Within minutes I had signed up, and within hours (about 48) I was standing on a beach next to a Chanel-branded surfboard like a person who has an unlimited budget for heat-wave formalwear.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that dress. The more I rented, the more the compliments rolled in. Things that I normally wouldn\u2019t buy, either because they were too expensive or too flashy, were folded into my regular rotation. The Khaite dress, a Stine Goya babydoll with a dollhouse print, a Susan Alexandra beaded bag \u2014 all became mine for a few glorious days.\n\nSince 2013, rental has blossomed. Le Tote just bought Lord & Taylor. Ann Taylor, Bloomingdale\u2019s, and American Eagle all have launched subscriptions. If you want the fanciest formalwear, there\u2019s Nova Octo, where you can rent Tom Ford dresses for $950; if you want kids\u2019 clothes, try Stitch Fix. Rent the Runway is valued at $1 billion, but there\u2019s a difference between success in business and success in the aesthetics-driven wonderland that is fashion. Up until recently, RTR\u2019s edit has been very mainstream, presumably so that they could appeal to a huge audience. That\u2019s logical from a making-money standpoint, but it didn\u2019t do much to impress my fashion-editor co-worker who worships at the alter of Rei Kawakubo. Anecdotally, she\u2019s loved almost all of the rented dresses I\u2019ve worn to the office (especially this Co maxi).\n\nSarah Tam, the chief merchant for Rent the Runway, said the new, fashion-forward edit is a mix of data and intuition. Over the last four years since subscription has started, Rent the Runway has harnessed the \u201cmillions of data points at their fingertips.\u201d With Unlimited, they added brands and saw how customers reacted, then finessed the assortment using customer feedback, which they were getting in real time.\n\nTam noticed the customer was wearing a lot of wear-to-work clothing, and specifically gravitating toward tailoring. So for fall, they added Margiela and other tailoring-forward brands. And as for their data: I wear between an 8 and a 10, but when I ordered the Co maxi mentioned above, a little pink \u201cRTR Insight\u201d suggested I get the size 4. It fit perfectly. Rent the Runway doesn\u2019t give out stats on how many people use their service, but I asked the man at my local UPS on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and he said \u201chundreds\u201d of navy-blue subscription bags come through that location each day. (Twice a week, I add mine to a stack of others.)\n\nOf course, if everyone rents the same clothing, there\u2019s always a chance that we\u2019ll all end up looking identical, possibly in the one pink coat that unnerves boyfriends and husbands the world over. Truth be told, when I get off my subway stop now in SoHo, I always spot RTR picks \u2014 Monse jeans, Isabel Marant dresses, Marni bags. But that\u2019s also an issue with mass production. Everyone has the leopard-print skirt! It\u2019s better for the environment and for your wallet if it\u2019s the same leopard skirt passed around America via a rental service.\n\nOver 100 billion items of clothing are made each year, and half of all fast-fashion garments are thrown away within a year. If you\u2019re only going to wear a leopard skirt for one season, doesn\u2019t it make sense to rent? I\u2019ve worked hard this past year to keep my wardrobe minimal and sustainable \u2014 a task that means trying to rewire my brain to stop craving new things. With renting, that shift isn\u2019t necessary. (Whether that\u2019s healthy is a discussion for another day.) Rent the Runway allows me to wear gorgeous, high-quality clothes for as long as it feels appropriate, send them off for cleaning, and regroup. It costs $140 a month \u2014 cheaper than a membership to The Wing. And it\u2019s inclusive: The company added plus sizes in 2013 and stocks clothes up to a size 22.\n\nMaybe at some point in time, I\u2019ll have such a defined personal style that I won\u2019t feel the need to try trends just for the night. But until then, I\u2019ll be raking in the compliments and enjoying my digital dream closet.\n\n8 Designers to Look for on RTR\n\nKhaite: The brand that convinced me to get a membership in the first place. If your beat is sophisticated clothes with just a little bit of flair, you\u2019ll love it.\n\nCo: If you want everyone to think you\u2019re very artistic and sophisticated. I\u2019m currently waiting for this burnt-orange dress to become available in my size. It reminds me of origami.\n\nRejina Pyo: Pyo\u2019s statement dresses are consistently all over fashion month. The famous Greta dress isn\u2019t on RTR (yet \u2026 fingers crossed) but some equally brightly colored dresses are, along with some of her oblong bags.\n\nBrock Collection: If your first reaction to the prairie dress trend was \u201cYes, please!\u201d then you probably already know about Brock. The New York brand is known for romantic, Jane Austen\u2013esque designs. Just look at this red dress!\n\nKoch\u00e9: This was a brand I discovered through Rent the Runway. I rented this black polo dress, which achieves my goal of looking like a prep-gone-wrong. Turns out, that\u2019s a lot of Koch\u00e9\u2019s aesthetic, and now I\u2019ve re-rented the same dress four times.\n\nDodo Bar Or: Is your body caftan ready for summer? Then it\u2019s ready for Dodo Bar Or. The bright, bold, straight-from-the-1970s prints are not for the faint of heart.\n\nMarni: Marni has a reputation for being a brand for the smart, fashionable woman. Unlike their Philophile counterparts, though, the Marni customer appreciates prints.\n\nStine Goya: Stine Goya pieces feel feminine, playful, and very now. I got to look like a dollhouse for a day, which was a dream.", "description": "Why should you be renting your clothes with a service like Rent the Runway Unlimited? Why not, really.
