REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo\n\nOf 65 commercial deals that Huawei has signed, half are with European customers building ultra-fast fifth-generation networks, the global networks market leader said on Tuesday at a client conference in Zurich.\n\n\u201cThis shows European customers\u2019 long-term and consistent trust in Huawei - we are really grateful for their trust in this difficult time,\u201d Yang Chaobin, head of Huawei\u2019s 5G business, told Reuters in an interview.\n\nVisitors heard positive testimony from several operators, including Switzerland\u2019s Sunrise - which has connected a ski resort, farms and even a soccer stadium to its Huawei-powered 5G network that went live six months ago.\n\nThe contrast could not be more striking between industry enthusiasm for Huawei\u2019s products and U.S. allegations - denied by the company - that its gear contains \u2018back doors\u2019 open to cyber spies.\n\nSomewhere between stand European governments and regulators, trying to reconcile those U.S. warnings with opposing arguments that the standards the industry is developing for 5G provide sufficient safeguards.\n\n\u201cFrom a technical perspective, security is something we can solve,\u201d Chaobin told a separate news briefing. \u201cBut if you look at security as a political issue, and judging the security of a vendor based on its origin, then it\u2019s very difficult to solve.\u201d\n\nGermany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, has just published a proposed set of rules on 5G network security that stops short of singling out China or Huawei as threats; instead requiring all vendors and operators to meet common criteria.\n\nBy contrast, Britain is still mulling whether to follow the advice of its National Security Council to ban Huawei - a step already taken by English-speaking U.S. allies Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\u201cNO IMPACT\u201d\n\nWashington imposed export controls on Huawei in May, in an escalation of a trade dispute with Beijing that has inflicted severe damage on the Chinese firm\u2019s other main business: making and selling smartphones.\n\nBut, said Yang, Huawei had diversified its supplier base enough to fully meet demand from customers for its network equipment even without U.S.-sourced components.\n\nOf a total of 400,000 5G base stations it has supplied, three-quarters have been supplied since the U.S. ban.\n\n\u201cThe entity listing has had no impact on Huawei\u2019s 5G equipment whatsoever,\u201d Yang told Reuters. \u201cThe performance and specification of the products with our own components will only be better.\u201d\n\nThe challenge Yang has faced in meeting the needs of Sunrise and other European customers is different: Providing the right equipment in a part of the world where space to erect antennae is scarce.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A 5G sign is pictured at Huawei's booth at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Shanghai, China, June 28, 2019.
