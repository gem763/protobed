US Air Force/Airman 1st Class Christina Bennett\n\nInterestingly, in the last few hours, the US military has continued to release images of the short deployment of the B-1s to PSAB (that, among all the other things, show that the Lancers all carried the SNIPER Advanced Targeting Pod that has become a pretty standard feature of the \"Bone\").\n\nUSAFCENT published a series of aerial photographs of the Lancers taking fuel over the Persian Gulf as well as being escorted by the F-22 Raptors and EA-18G Growlers.\n\nThe presence of an unspecified number of EA-18G Growlers has not been officially announced, but it's not a secret.\n\nTeased by the patch worn by an aircrew member depicted close a Raptor during a visit to PSAB by US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, it was confirmed by the photo at the top of this article that shows the B-1s on their way to Saudi Arabia being escorted by two Growlers and, above all, by the presence of the VAQ-134 CAG bird in the same clamshell aircraft hangars where CNN's Christiane Amanpour interviewed Esper on October 22:\n\nEarlier this month, the Pentagon announced the deployment of additional US forces to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. But the list of equipment included \"only\":\n\nTwo Fighter Squadrons\n\nOne Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW)\n\nTwo Patriot Batteries\n\nOne Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD)\n\nThe Department of Defense did not disclose the bombers deployment (that should be quite short \u2014 hence the reason for not being listed) nor the US Navy Electronic Attack squadron (the VAQ-134 \"Garudas\"), unless it referred to it as a generic \"Fighter Squadron.\"\n\nA US Air Force B-1B bomber refuels while in flight to Saudi Arabia, October 24, 2019.
