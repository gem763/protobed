His trusts purportedly participated in a \u201cnew cryptocurrency auto-trading program.\u201d\n\nAustin maintained contracts with the Ghanaian firm that said he would pay back investments with additional benefits at the close of trading. However, he never did and kept deferring the situation with weak excuses.\n\nOne victim was quoted by GhanaWeb as saying: \u201cHe [Austin] will take your Bitcoin and you will never get your investment back or your returns. On the day of payment, he will tell you story after story filled with lies of issues why the BTC couldn\u2019t be delivered on the day of payment.\u201d\n\nThe victim says Austin gave a whole raft of excuses including; that he\u2019d suffered a heart attack, transferred coins to the wrong wallet, was in queues at banks, and that banks were holding the funds.\n\nDespite numerous attempts at contacting Austin, the Ghanaian firm has not been able to recover their investment. Austin has also failed to respond to numerous requests for comment from GhanaWeb.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time an individual or business has been hoodwinked by promises of returns on fake Bitcoin investments.\n\nEarlier this year, a man from Jersey put $1.5 million \u2013 their life savings \u2013 into a Bitcoin investment scheme and lost everything, because there never was any Bitcoin.", "description": "A former American professional basketball player has allegedly swindled over $800,000 worth of Bitcoin from a company based in Ghana.", "authors": ["Matthew Beedham", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Faustin-ghana-bitcoin-scam-blockchain-marketing-blockchain-nba-basketball.jpg&signature=dbcefad9264ccee5438496c4cd67b936", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
