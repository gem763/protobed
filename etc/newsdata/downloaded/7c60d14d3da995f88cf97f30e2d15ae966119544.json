Sit back as your tour manager brings to life the city\u2019s iconic landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, gleaming Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur and the Louvre. Take in the colour and bustle of the Parisian streets, the \"grands boulevards\" and the great parks, including the riverside Jardins des Tuileries. After the tour, you'll be free to explore on your own. Head to the city\u2019s historic island heart, close to the poignant shell of N\u00f4tre-Dame cathedral, to the Left Bank and bustling St-Germain, village-like St-Paul, the aristocratic Marais or arty, hilly Montmartre. Perhaps you\u2019ll take a trip up the Eiffel Tower or a cruise on the Seine, stroll down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, stop for coffee or lunch in a pavement caf\u00e9, make plans for dinner... In truth, perhaps it\u2019s best not to plan at all. Let the city, its transport system, your feet and your whims arrange your time for you before you return to the hotel at the end of a marvellous day.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://holidays.theguardian.com/tourimg.php?a=img&img=87b9ab94cfac40a534c695a855000ed4"}
