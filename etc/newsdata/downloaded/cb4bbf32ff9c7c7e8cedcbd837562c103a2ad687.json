If the exclusion request is approved, tariffs imposed since Sept 1 can be returned, it said.\n\nShan Weijian, group chairman and CEO of PAG, a Hong Kongbased private equity firm, said it is in the best interests of both countries to move away from zero-sum thinking and put an end to the ad hoc decoupling that the trade war has threatened.\n\nThe best path forward is not to close but to tear down existing barriers and further open up trade, Shan said in an article.\n\n\"Ultimately, a mix of cooperation and competition within a rules-based system will lead to the greatest prosperity for both countries and for the world economy, as all trading nations have learned throughout history,\" he said.\n\nThere have been encouraging signs that China and the US are managing to narrow their differences and end the trade row. It was reported that both negotiating teams outlined the preliminary agreement in the latest high-level trade consultations in Washington.\n\nThe US side delayed the tariff hikes originally scheduled for Oct 15. The Ministry of Commerce said China plans to increase the purchase of US agricultural products based on the outlined phase-one deal.\n\nRen Zeping, chief economist and director of the Evergrande Think Tank, said a partial deal, if signed, doesn't mean the trade dispute has been fully settled. More efforts will be needed to solve the potential challenges, he said in a recent research note.", "description": "Only cooperation will pave the way to prosperity for China, the United States and the global economy, experts said after the US announced a plan to exempt tariffs on some Chinese imports meeting certain criteria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db104f7a310cf3e97a2b32e.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
