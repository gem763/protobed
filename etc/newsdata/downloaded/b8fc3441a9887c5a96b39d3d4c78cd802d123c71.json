Justine Handelman oversees the policy and representation team, and John Cerisano leads the lobbying team. The second highest spender, Northrop Grumman, has a woman, Lesley Kalan, leading its government relations.\n\nBut the rest of the top 10 corporate spenders on lobbying \u2014 Amazon, Facebook, United Technologies, Boeing, AT&T, Koch, Pfizer and Lockheed Martin \u2014 have men leading their D.C. offices.\n\nOverall, at least 22 corporate heads of companies\u2019 D.C. offices are people of color, according to data from the Washington Heads of Office, a group made up of senior government affairs executives of color. But those in the lobbying world say the numbers should be higher.\n\n\u201cWashington is a sophisticated, progressive, educated, affluent city. But given that environment, the fact that the political and advocacy worlds are not more diverse, it\u2019s a major problem that has to be addressed and it\u2019s a serious issue,\u201d Doug Pinkham, president of the Public Affairs Council, told The Hill.\n\nTrade associations, lobbying shops and law firms say they are working to diversify their ranks after growing pressure amid the most diverse Congress in history. But critics say the top lobbying jobs at companies don\u2019t see frequent turnover, and they say companies need to better nurture their talent pipeline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for lack of trying within the company. I think the issue, a lot of it is a pipeline problem in Washington,\u201d Pinkham said.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many folks in the top roles. There are some pipeline folks, but they still have a way to go, and that\u2019s the challenge,\u201d executive recruiter Julian Ha, a partner at Heidrick & Struggles, told The Hill.\n\nSome companies are flush with minority and female lobbyists, but just not at the top spot.\n\nTimothy McBride is the senior vice president of government relations at United Technologies. His lobbying team includes two African American men and two women, one of whom is Latina.\n\nPhilip Ellender is the president of government and public affairs at Koch, but the company has a woman, Catherine Haggett, as director of federal affairs.\n\nThere are also prominent companies with minorities in the highest ranks.\n\nAlphabet, the parent company for Google, is the 11th highest spender on lobbying. Karan Bhatia, who is of Indian descent, is Google\u2019s vice president of government affairs and public policy. In the top 15 spenders, FedEx\u2019s D.C. operation is led by Gina Adams, an African American woman, and Microsoft\u2019s by an African American man, Fred Humphries.\n\nAnd there are more women in the 11\u201320 tier of corporate spenders. Victoria Blatter heads the D.C. office for Amgen Inc., Liz Reicherts leads the office for General Motors, and two energy giants, Chevron and ExxonMobil\u2019s D.C. offices, are captained by Maria Pica Karp and Jeanne Mitchell, respectively.\n\nBut \u201ca lot more needs to be done,\u201d said Humphries, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president of U.S. government affairs. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of exceptional, untapped talent in this town among people of color. We need more investment, more resources, more mentoring and a real, concerted effort to expand our pipelines.\u201d\n\nH Street Group, an informal association for Asian American lobbyists, told The Hill none of their members are leading D.C. corporate lobbying offices.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing that not one of these talented individuals yet leads any of these organizations,\u201d H Street chair Jocelyn Hong said.\n\nThe Hispanic Lobbyists Association says 22 percent of their members are corporate lobbyists, with 2 percent of the membership serving as head of a corporate office.\n\nDeDe Lea, an African American woman, is executive vice president of global government affairs at Viacom, leading their D.C. office since 2005. Lea says she\u2019s used to standing out in a room.\n\n\u201cAlmost my entire life, except for my four years at Howard University, I was either the only African American or the only woman,\u201d she said. \u201cI was always the only something, and so I learned early on you just can\u2019t focus on that, you just can\u2019t worry about that.\u201d\n\nGina Adams went to FedEx as an attorney in 1992 and is now senior vice president of government affairs.\n\n\u201cThere were a few women in the field, but I can\u2019t remember seeing many African Americans doing the kind of work that I was doing. By 2001, when I was promoted into my current responsibilities, there were still only a handful of minority lobbyists. Obviously, it\u2019s an issue, but I don\u2019t think it preoccupies us. Most of us are out there working hard for our companies or our clients,\u201d she told The Hill.\n\nAdams said the transportation industry has historically been dominated by men.\n\n\u201cWhen FedEx first started, the people working in our warehouses and delivering packages were men. As we grew into a global corporation, that\u2019s who you saw rise to the top of the company,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Adams added that FedEx has taken steps to diversify the workplace and leadership team.\n\nHeadhunters say they are increasingly asked by corporations to help diversify their ranks.\n\n\u201cI get asked about my ability to produce a diverse slate of candidates by almost every organization I talk with about recruiting for senior level government relations roles,\u201d headhunter Ivan Adler told The Hill.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing awareness among the private corporate sector of the need to have diversity in their Washington offices \u2014 ideally in the top roles,\u201d Ha said. \u201cClients are bringing it up themselves, without our prompting, and applying genuine pressure for folks like us to present diverse slates.\u201d\n\nHa added there is only so much headhunters can do, though.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always implored organizations to promote diversity but also ensure there is support once that person is there through proper onboarding and continued mentorship; they can attract these folks at the more junior level, but can they actually retain them? That\u2019s where it thins out,\u201d he said.\n\nLea reiterated that it\u2019s up to companies to be proactive about diversity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lack of talent available. It just could be there\u2019s a lack of will to go beyond your comfort zone,\u201d she said. Lea said diversity was important for a company like Viacom.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at all of our brands, we have such a diverse suite of channels\u2014 we have BET, Logo TV, Country Music Television, MTV, Nickelodeon,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really do reflect a lot of America and because of that, diversity and inclusion are really important issues for us.\u201d\n\nThose in the influence world said that the pipeline to these jobs often starts on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cProbably the major pathway going into this field is to work on Capitol Hill,\u201d said Pinkham. \u201cThat\u2019s when you get the real problem. Who gets to be a congressional intern? Probably a privileged white kid.\u201d\n\nAdams noted the importance of nurturing individuals coming up in the industry.\n\n\u201cAs opportunities to fill senior roles with new talent, minority candidates need to have had the right preparation and experiences to be qualified,\u201d Adams said.\n\n\u201cDiversity has to be a part of overall hiring processes in virtually all industries, including our own.\u201d", "description": "The lobbying world has been under pressure to diversify, and that scrutiny is now turning to the ranks of corporate lobbyists.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/kstreetdiversity_webversion-01.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
