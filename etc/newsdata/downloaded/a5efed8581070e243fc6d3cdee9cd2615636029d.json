The company\u2019s second-quarter earnings were a big disappointment, as was the news that the company laid off 20% of its workforce.\n\nWhile it\u2019s encouraging to see that Nio finished quarter three on a high note, this doesn\u2019t discount the very real headwinds the company faces. And even after the jump in the company\u2019s shares, Nio\u2019s stock price is still down 81% from a year earlier.\n\nHere are three things you should know before investing in Nio stock.\n\nNio\u2019s Sales Have Been Hit or Miss\n\nIn recent months Nio, and the Nio stock price, has struggled due to declining electric vehicle sales in China. The company\u2019s sales first started to drop in July, after the Chinese government reduced subsidies for electric vehicles in June. The U.S. experienced declining demand for electric cars as well.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the demand for electric vehicles grew 35% during the first half of 2019. Increasingly, consumers are looking for more fuel-efficient vehicles. China is at an advantage since it\u2019s the largest producer of electric cars.\n\nHowever, electric cars are priced higher than other vehicles. It remains to be seen whether the demand for Nio\u2019s vehicles could drop further during an economic downturn.\n\nThe Company Has Real Financial Problems\n\nIn the coming years, it seems likely that more consumers will begin to embrace electric vehicles. The question is, will NIO still be around when that happens, or will the company have spent through its cash reserves first?\n\nThe company is burning through cash at an astonishing rate. During the second quarter, the company spent $620 million in preparation for the launch of the ES6.\n\nNio does have a deal with its largest investor, Tencent Holdings, for an investment of $200 million. But at the rate the company\u2019s spending money, $200 million probably won\u2019t go very far.\n\nNIO Is Nowhere Near Profitability\n\nFinally, the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings are a step in the right direction, but Nio is still nowhere near profitability. Most analysts agree that it\u2019s better to hold the stock at this point until it\u2019s clear what will happen with the company\u2019s financials.\n\nEven analysts that were previously bullish on Nio stock are starting to become hesitant about the company\u2019s future. A Goldman Sachs analyst recently downgraded the stock, citing problems with sales and possible share dilution.\n\nThe market for electric vehicles is going to be big and Nio still has potential. But the company is going to have to get ahold of its spending and sales before it\u2019s considered a good investment.\n\nAs of this writing, Jamie Johnson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Nio Stock Jumped After Q3 Win, But Headwinds Persist appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "description": "Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock climbed more than 11% after the \"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China\" reported strong third-quarter earnings on Oct. 8.
