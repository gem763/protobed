Tesla stock closed at $254.68 on Wednesday, which at the time represented a 23.4% slide for 2019.\n\nTesla is the most heavily shorted stock in the U.S., as well as the most heavily shorted automaker in the world. Short interest, or the number of shares borrowed in hopes of buying them back at a profit after the stock drops, totals $9.03 billion for Tesla, according to S3.\n\nSome high-profile short sellers such as Greenlight founder David Einhorn and Jim Chanos have clashed with Tesla and CEO Musk in the last few years.\n\nMusk himself has over the years taken to Twitter to do battle against such doubters, fighting back against investors betting against his stock and other detractors, often with controversial comments.", "description": "Tesla popped 16.5% Thursday, meaning short sellers betting against the stock are on track for $1.4 billion in mark-to-market losses.", "authors": ["Thomas Franck"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106201578-1571932238716elon.jpg?v=1571932648", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
