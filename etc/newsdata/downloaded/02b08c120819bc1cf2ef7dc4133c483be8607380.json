A high-profile casualty of the first phase of the #MeToo era, in which a number of famous men faced accusations of sexual misconduct and assault, he was also fired by CBS News.\n\nResponding to the new lawsuit, which was filed in Manhattan state court, Rose\u2019s attorney said he denied allegations that \u201cmakes a good tabloid story, but not much else\u201d.\n\nGina Riggi managed makeup for the Charlie Rose show for 22 years. She claims to have endured \u201cmisogynistic, abusive behavior \u2026 demeaning, embarrassing and degrading her because of her gender, ridiculing her physical appearance and physically accosting her on the set, forcing her to use a hand mirror to protect herself from him\u201d.\n\nRose is also alleged to have \u201ccreated a toxic work environment suffused with sexual harassment and gender-based abuse for \u2026 female staff, using the show as an instrument of his predatory sexual behavior, and the Bloomberg studio where he recorded it as a sexual hunting ground\u201d.\n\nRose is alleged to have preyed on women at his Manhattan and Hamptons homes, as well as \u201ctrendy restaurants where he insisted on hosting staff events\u201d.\n\n\u201cMr Rose routinely groped and pawed at his female staff, pressed himself against them, hugged them, kissed them, pulled them toward him, whispered in their ears, stared at their breasts, looked down their shirts and otherwise subjected them to inappropriate and unwanted physical contact,\u201d continues the suit, which was filed on 19 September.\n\nRiggi also says she once heard a female producer \u201cmake reference to \u2018the crusty claw\u2019, a reference to Mr Rose\u2019s propensity to grab female staff inappropriately\u201d.\n\nIn a statement to the Guardian, Rose\u2019s lawyer, Jonathan Bach, said his client \u201cvehemently denies and will vigorously contest these allegations\u201d.\n\nRiggi\u2019s allegations, Bach said, are \u201ccompletely inconsistent with written statements made by the plaintiff to Mr Rose, including \u2018I love working for you at your show, and would love to be part of any show that you host\u2019, \u2018I consider it an honor to be a member of your team\u2019 and \u2018hope to see you more often! Please stop by anytime\u2019, with a smiley face.\n\n\u201cThis is not a lawsuit about any real legal wrongs directed at the plaintiff,\u201d Bach continued, \u201cas much as an opportunity to recycle second- and third-hand, unproven allegations she and her lawyer have managed to scrounge together. It makes a good tabloid story, but not much else.\u201d\n\nThe civil complaint alleges that Rose \u201ctargeted young, attractive women just beginning their journalism careers, dangling internships and jobs to lure them to \u2018interviews\u2019 and \u2018career discussions\u2019 with him, often over drinks and dinner.\n\n\u201cBut, far from being an advocate for their careers, Mr Rose treated them as sexual targets, using his power and influence to serve his personal desires. In many instances, he never offered these women any employment at all.\u201d\n\nRiggi claims that she was \u201cverbally abused \u2026 on an almost daily basis\u201d. She alleges Rose \u201cregularly swatted at her physically as she attempted to comb his hair or adjust his makeup\u201d.\n\n\u201cOn one occasion,\u201d the suit adds, \u201cwhile taping on location outside of the studio, Mr Rose became upset while Ms Riggi applied his makeup, and forcefully grabbed and twisted her arm, physically hurting her.\u201d.\n\nRiggi protested and told supervisors, the suit says, but did not receive a response. Eventually, she \u201cresorted to using a large hand mirror as a shield so that Mr Rose could not physically assault her\u201d.\n\nRiggi also claims she was improperly classified as a contract worker, wrongly making her ineligible for unemployment benefits when Rose\u2019s show ended.\n\n\u201cAt no time was the plaintiff an employee of ours,\u201d a Bloomberg spokesman told CNN. \u201cWe understand that the plaintiff was a contractor of Charlie Rose Inc, and given that they operated independently of us, any of her compensation would have been handled solely by [them].\u201d\n\n\u2018We have no records of any complaint,\u201d the spokesman also said.\n\nPBS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Longtime makeup artist Gina Riggi claims she endured \u2018misogynistic, abusive behavior\u2019 from Rose", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b765d02f9f62c21647e4ad536be7917fcfa7fbae/0_169_2860_1716/master/2860.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9d27179caec5d2bca250b269b873203f", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
