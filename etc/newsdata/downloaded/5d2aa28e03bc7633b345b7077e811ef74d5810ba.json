He is the most recently named portfolio manager on an elite five-person team. Backed by one of the industry\u2019s best analyst benches, this team uses a high-conviction multimanager approach to run Primecap\u2019s six U.S. open-end funds. As each fund receives a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold, investors would do well to understand their differences, especially in the aftermath of years like 2018, when the three funds that Primecap subadvises for Vanguard outperformed their Odyssey-branded counterparts.\n\nPrimecap\u2019s six funds fall into three pairs. Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth (POAGX) and Vanguard Capital Opportunity (VHCOX) look for companies with rapid earnings growth, many of which are mid-, small-, and micro-cap stocks. Vanguard Capital Opportunity\u2019s larger asset base puts more limitations on its ability to buy micro-cap stocks. Primecap Odyssey Growth (POGRX) and Vanguard Primecap (VPMCX) look for companies with rapid earnings growth and invest across the market-cap spectrum, with Vanguard Primecap\u2019s larger asset base putting more limits on its flexibility. Primecap Odyssey Stock (POSKX) and Vanguard Primecap Core (VPCCX) look for companies that are attractive for a variety of reasons, including better than expected growth potential, mispriced assets, or turnaround potential.", "description": "Putting recent results in context.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt449bfc4a860d66a6/5cf68f9f592114fc054aa4d1/Rating_Fund_1x1.svg"}
