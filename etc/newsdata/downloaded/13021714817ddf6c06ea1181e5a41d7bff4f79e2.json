However, it has been reported that a massive 350 million capsules are thrown away every year \u2013 and that\u2019s just in the UK alone. A pretty sobering thought.\n\nDon\u2019t worry though, we\u2019re not about to suggest you forgo your quick caffeine fix (heaven forbid!) because thankfully there\u2019s a whole host of brands offering an eco-alternative.\n\nConvenience is undoubtedly key \u2013 only 28 per cent of Nespresso\u2019s pods are recycled, partly due to the fact they need to be collected or taken to a collection point. It\u2019s all well and good that your pod can be recycled, but unless you actually do it, it\u2019s really pretty useless.\n\nOf course, the contents of a capsule is just as important \u2013 when putting these pods to the test we were looking for great tasting coffee, sourced ethically with the minimal amount of middlemen in the chain to ensure the farmer gets the fairest possible price. We were also on the lookout for other eco-credentials such as charity donations.\n\nA capsule that is Fairtrade, organic and recyclable, may sound like the company is making a push for sustainability, but in reality the Fairtrade price (essentially a minimum wage for farmers) is very low \u2013 and coffee can be organic because the farmer is simply too poor to buy pesticides, not because they put in place sustainable farming practises.\n\nSo if you\u2019re keen to really make a difference, it\u2019s important to debunk the label. We\u2019ve attempted to do that for you, so you can get on with drinking the good stuff.\n\nEco Pod Glossary\n\nAs the world has wizened up to the environmental impact that our time-saving habits are causing, so too have brands and are now adapting their offers. There really is no need to contribute to the single-use plastic problem with compostable, biodegradable and recyclable options all available. However, with all of this new terminology flying around it can be hard to know what\u2019s best.\n\nBiodegradable \u2013 this simply means the pod will eventually break down to nothing by natural processes - so technically even plastic could claim to be biodegradable. However, most brands that boast of biodegradability use pods that will take less than six months to disappear. A vast improvement on the reported 500 years or so it takes a plastic pod to do the same.\n\nCompostable \u2013 often confused with biodegradable but with a key difference. Although biodegradable products will eventually disappear, a compostable product will break down to become a pile of nutrient-rich soil. It\u2019s important to check if these can be composted at home or need industrial composting facilities. The former might seem easier but very often will take much longer to break down as conditions need to be just right to allow the process to take place. The latter isn\u2019t a disaster, it just means pods will need to be put in your food collection bin rather than chucked in your garden. The benefit to compostable capsules is that there\u2019s no need to dismantle the pod, the whole thing can be composted, contents and all. How long it takes to break down will vary but you can expect it to take anything from around four to 16 weeks.\n\nRecyclable \u2013 pods created from aluminium are designed to be popped into your regular recycling, like an empty tin of beans! They will need rinsing first though, so aren\u2019t quite as faff free as compostable \u2013 however they\u2019re still a good option if you don\u2019t have access to a food waste disposal bin.\n\nPlastic-free \u2013 brands should only be making this claim if there is no plastic at all within the capsule itself, as well as the packaging it comes in.\n\nOrganic \u2013 just like anything we consume, it\u2019s better if it hasn\u2019t been doused in unwanted chemicals \u2013 both for us and our planet. However, coffee can often claim to be organic simply because poorer farms can\u2019t actually afford the chemicals, so be sure to check this in conjunction with a brand\u2019s Fairtrade payment policies.\n\nFairtrade \u2013 which brings us nicely onto Fairtrade. It\u2019s imperative that farmers are paid a fair price for their coffee beans. This ensures we\u2019re contributing to a better life for farming families and the wider community. If possible look for brands paying above the Fairtrade minimum price.\n\nUltimately, the best pod for you is going to be the one that\u2019s easiest for you to dispose of properly. So if you live in a fifth-floor flat with no garden, the idea of composting your pods may be frankly ridiculous, whereas recycling may be more manageable. It\u2019s up to all of us to do what we can. All of the pods we tested were compatible with a standard Nespresso machine.\n\nSo read on for the brands offering quick, tasty coffee that doesn\u2019t cost the earth.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Not only are the farmers always paid more than the Fairtrade price (which is actually pretty low to start with) but all the coffee is organic and sourced sustainably too. The capsule production is carbon neutral and it even offsets its sea miles (which are unavoidable when moving the unroasted coffee from where it\u2019s grown). Suitable for home and commercial composting, this starter pack includes its bold, exotic and rare pods, ideal for lungos, espressos and ristretto respectively. They\u2019re all delicious but Roar Gill has created something particularly special with their rare pods \u2013 expect a silky smooth chocolatey body and zippy balanced acidity.\n\nBuy now\n\nToast Coffee taster box: \u00a317.50 for 50 assorted pods, Toast Coffee\n\nToast Coffee were the first brand to make us realise just how delicious coffee from a pod could be. It only uses speciality grade coffee beans from individual farms (which accounts forless than 1 per cent of the world\u2019s coffee), so although you may find cheaper pods out there, they probably won\u2019t be such great quality. The taster box doubles up on the house blend in place of decaf, allowing you to try the whole caffeinated range. A huge advantage with these biodegradable pods is that there\u2019s no need to wash and rinse out, the whole pod can be composted or popped in with your garden waste. Hurrah! Not only are the pods themselves eco but the outer packaging is completely plastic-free, using recycled card sourced from sustainably managed forests.\n\nBuy now\n\nLost Sheep smooth journey coffee: \u00a33.95 for 10 pods, Lost Sheep\n\nPlastic-free and 100 per cent compostable, Lost Sheep Coffee capsules are made from wood bark. Only ever using Grade 1 single-origin coffee beans sourced from a friend\u2019s Rainforest Alliance Certified farm in Brazil, the beans are then roasted here in the UK\u2019s Garden of England, Kent. It\u2019s this close-knit, fully traceable supplier chain that ensures the farmer can be paid a fair price. Packaging is made using paper from FSC certified forests and despite the lack of plastic, pods are fully airtight so last up to 12 months. The smooth journey pods are the perfect everyday brew, with lightly nutty, milk chocolate notes. If you\u2019re looking for something a little different, the funky camper has a more fruit-forward red berry tasting profile.\n\nBuy now\n\nDualit aluminium capsules: \u00a33.20 for a box of 10 or \u00a313.80 for a pack of 60, Dualit\n\nSuitable for both Dualit and Nespresso machines, these aluminium capsules are easier to recycle than ever, with most local authorities accepting them. However, what\u2019s inside matters too and these Fairtrade pods deliver when it comes to flavour, with all coffee roasted, ground and popped into the pods in their on-site roaster in West Sussex. There are four blends in the new range including our favourite the orange-hued ristretto, which is the strongest, with creamy chocolate notes and a buttery smooth mouthfeel. There\u2019s also a full-bodied intense (dark brown pod), a purple medium-strength lungo designed for americanos and finally a bright blue decaf version for those shunning the caffeine. Once used, the coffee grounds can be added to compost or a food waste bin, while the capsule and lid can go straight in with your regular recycling. In addition, Dualit has reduced the outer box size resulting in a more compact and space-saving design with no sachet inside, helping to further reduce the environmental impact.\n\nBuy now\n\nHalo coffee capsule: From \u00a37 for 10, Halo Coffee\n\nThe daterra moonlight, which happens to be Halo\u2019s cheapest coffee, is a single-origin from Brazil.

Because the pods are made from 100 per cent compostable sugar cane and paper pulp, they can expand and get a little stuck in the machine, so we found it was best to eject straight after making your coffee for peace of mind.
