But with rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, several of these rivers have been polluted to the extent that their waters have been rendered useless and toxic for both consumption as well as agricultural use.\n\nWhile there are many reasons behind this, one of the most prominent is the pollution out of religious activities and immersion of idols is a prominent cause.\n\nBut perhaps for the first time since Durga Puja celebrations began in New Delhi over 100 years ago, no idols were immersed in the Yamuna this year. The marvellous feat was achieved as the authorities in the national capital came into action and set up multiple layers of barricades to block all routes that lead to some of Delhi\u2019s most popular ghats.\n\nThis comes after the Central Government has banned immersion of idols in the holy river Ganga and its tributaries.\n\nDon't Miss 284 SHARES 3.5 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 1.6 K SHARES\n\nTrucks that were bringing idols of the Hindu goddess as well as people approaching the banks of the river in their personal vehicles had to make their way to the nearest idol immersion pit created by the Delhi government, reported the Times of India.\n\nThe credit also goes to Delhi Police who were stationed at most of the entrance points to river ghats. They were even guarding the bridges so that people do not immerse the idols into the water by simply throwing them into the river from the bridges.\n\nThe passersby were informed that they should not pollute the river and thanks to rising consciousness with regards to environmental degradation, the commoners too played their part and prevented the immersion of idols in the Yamuna.\n\nThe river that passes through Delhi as well as Agra often features among the most polluted of Indian rivers and several steps have been taken in recent times to safeguard them. The prevention of immersion of Durga idols in the river is one such.\n\nWe are, however, far from achieving the desired results if cleanliness of the rivers is to be taken into consideration. Therefore, we need several such steps and the participation of both the authorities as well as the common people to ensure that our rivers are protected.", "description": "India is a land of many rivers and since time immemorial, they have been serving as the lifeline for our population.
