She eats protein shakes made from plant-based protein sources such as pea protein or hemp milk. And for lunch she typically eats salads and will make a chickpea pasta dish for dinner. Despite the trendy ingredients, Bell says husband Dax Shepard shops at an affordable grocery chain, not a fancy one.\n\nBell added that she doesn't restrict herself when it comes to food. \"I find that through conscious eating, I'm able to have all the rewards and also maintain a healthy, steady diet,\" Bell told Women's Health. (Conscious or \"mindful\" eating is a non-diet approach that encourages people to pay attention to and notice their food choices and habits without judgement.)\n\nBeyond her diet, Bell has leaned in to some other buzzy wellness trends to keep her mental health in check.\n\nFor example, Bell, who has says she has struggled with anxiety and depression since she was 18, takes a dropper of cannabidiol (CBD) oil on her tongue to help manage anxiety. (Some studies show CBD to be effective for anxiety, including insomnia.)\n\nShe also told Women's Health that she adds adaptogens to her smoothies \u2014 adaptogens are herbal compounds that are supposed to work with or \"adapt to\" your body's stress response to reduce it. (At the moment there is very limited scientific evidence that adaptogens can combat the physiological effects of stress, and adaptogen supplements aren't regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.)\n\nIn addition to these holistic remedies, Bell said she takes antidepressants to help with \"waves of serotonin imbalance\" and still goes to therapy. In the past, she's revealed that she goes to couple's therapy with Shepherd.\n\nExercise is another habit that has increased her focus and physical strength. She takes a Pilates-inspired workout class at the boutique gym Studio Metamorphosis three times a week.\n\nAfter a workout, \"I feel so much more centered, patient, capable,\" Bell told Women's Health. \"It sets the next 48 hours for me.\"\ufeff\n\nDon't miss:", "description": "The actor opened up about her wellness routine: \"I have to eat carbs\" at work, she told Women's Health.
