Just what kind of royal future do Harry and Meghan want?\n\nThe documentary was presented by Harry\u2019s pal Tom Bradby, and as a result felt rather like a particularly long video clip on Harry and Meghan\u2019s Instagram feed.\n\nBradby, who brings to the art of cross-examination the ferocity of a pet sheep, will no doubt be delighted at his role in creating what was arguably the most nakedly emotionally-manipulative piece of royal television served up to British viewers since Diana met Martin Bashir for the notorious edition of BBC's Panorama, in which she spoke of the \u201cthree people\u201d in her marriage to Prince Charles (the third being Camilla Parker Bowles).\n\nFor Harry, the trauma of Diana's death runs visibly deep. In the documentary he even appeared to be attempting to weaponize her memory. In a segment widely reported before Sunday, Harry said that every time a camera flashes it reminds him of her tragic fate.\n\nAsked by Bradby if he felt at peace about his mother\u2019s death in 1997 or if it is \u201cstill a sort of wound that festers,\u201d Harry said, \u201cI think probably a wound that festers. I think being part of this family, and this role, and this job, every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back.\n\n\u201cIn that respect... it\u2019s the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best. The last time I was here was in 2013. But being here now, 22 years later, trying to finish what she started, yeah will be, will be incredibly emotional.\n\n\u201cBut everything that I do reminds me of her. But, as I said, with the role, with the job and the ... sort of the pressures that come with that I get reminded of the bad stuff unfortunately.\u201d\n\nHis father Prince Charles, by contrast, was not mentioned once. Bizarrely, however Chazzer popped up during one of the commercial breaks, in a trailer for a forthcoming TV show about his country estate.\n\nCharles was pictured chuckling along with a jolly and toothless son of the soil who appeared absolutely honored to be being thus patronized, against a backdrop of rolling English countryside and livestock, a strange reminder of what royalty used, not very long ago, to be.\n\nThen we were back to the new royals, new Angolan minefields and Harry talking, yes, once again, about his mother.\n\n\u201cI will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,\u201d Harry declared at one point, as a roaring camp fire blazed.\n\nWhile some of the documentary was indeed given over to Harry and Meghan's work in Africa, we swiftly cut back to the tear-jerking interviews with kids who had lost limbs to land mines, intercut with guess-who-yes-that\u2019s-right-Diana having the same conversations 22 years ago.\n\nWe even had a reunion between a young land mine victim who had met Diana for a famous photo in 1997 and now had five children herself, one of whom, we were informed with astonishing predictability, was called Diana.\n\nThe centerpiece of the film was, however, Harry's fireside interview with Bradby. It really seems like Harry is going through a particularly bad patch right now. He did at one stage talk about the need for \u201cmanagement,\u201d of his mental health problems, saying, \u201cI thought I was out of the woods and suddenly it all came back.\u201d", "description": "Chris JacksonIt was, according to one journalist who has long reported on the royals, a landmark documentary that would \u201cintensify questions about whether Prince Harry and Meghan Markle can cope with the pressures of life as high-profile members of the Royal Family.\u201dIn the extraordinary Harry\u00a0&\u00a0Meghan", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YYwX45ecpAjqytbxKrdZEw--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/5e363f580277cb33f2c4b4ef12827a05", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
