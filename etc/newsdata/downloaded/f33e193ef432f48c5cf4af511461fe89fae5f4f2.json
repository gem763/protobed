Earlier this month an officer was stabbed in the neck.\n\nPolice have responded with increasing amounts of rubber bullets, tear gas and even live rounds in recent clashes.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 A Hong Kong court has banned people from publishing a wide range of personal details about police officers and their families,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/dd06dc_police-force-its-officers-had-personal-details-leaked-online-hong-kong-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
