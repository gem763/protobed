This basement shopping area is full of places for you to eat, shop, rest, and repeat.\n\nSlurp on citrus noodles at Afuri\n\nAfuri\u2019s fragrant yuzu (Japanese citrus fruit) broth adds a delightful twang to the classic Japanese recipe.

In fact, bubble tea is so popular here there\u2019s even currently a pop-up theme park called Tapioca Land dedicated to the stuff.

Don\u2019t forget to wash it down with a glass of habushu (venomous snake liquor).\n\nOkinawan food is unique and healthy.\n\nSound strange? Of course!
