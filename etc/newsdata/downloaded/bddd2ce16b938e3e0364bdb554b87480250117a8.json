Another bluntly said that a new deal would be difficult to do swiftly if London demanded substantive changes.\n\n\u201cWe do think there\u2019s a good way forward,\u201d said Johnson, the face of the referendum \u201cLeave\u201d campaign, promising to formally present \u201ca very good offer ... very soon\u201d.\n\n\u201cI would like to veil our proposals in decent obscurity until we have been able to share them properly with our friends,\u201d he said, dismissing a report that London would propose customs posts either side of the Irish border.\n\nJohnson says he wants to secure an amended agreement at an EU summit on Oct. 17-18, and that both sides are keen on a deal to allow an orderly Brexit. Many EU diplomats doubt a breakthrough is possible by the summit.\n\n\u201cWe are sitting here every day ready to negotiate, the kamikaze way in which it is being treated by the UK government is not something we have chosen,\u201d one EU diplomat said.\n\nAnother said a move \u201chalf an inch\u201d from the current proposal to keep open the sensitive border between Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland would make a deal difficult.\n\nIn a moment of truth that will define the future of Brexit, the EU and his premiership, Johnson is betting he can get enough concessions from Brussels to persuade Brexit supporters in the British parliament to ratify any deal.\n\nIf he succeeds, Johnson will go down in history as the British leader who delivered Brexit. If he fails, a law has been passed by parliament forcing him to delay departure \u2014 a step that could destroy his popularity among \u201cLeave\u201d voters.\n\nJohnson said on Tuesday \u201cwe are working flat out to get a deal\u201d and denied speculation that he did not really want one, saying: \u201cThis is completely untrue - I really must stress it is the absolute inverse of reality.\u201d\n\nIRELAND\n\nIreland is crucial to any Brexit solution.\n\nJohnson\u2019s gamble hinges on the removal of the backstop, an insurance policy which aims to avoid the reimposition of checks along the United Kingdom\u2019s only land border with the EU.\n\nThe EU does not want Northern Ireland to become a \u201cback door\u201d to the EU single market but having an open border is important to safeguarding the 1998 Good Friday Agreement (GFA) that ended decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seen outside the venue for the Conservative Party annual conference in Manchester, Britain October 1, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is to get rid of the backstop, that is the most important thing,\u201d Johnson said, adding there was no point in leaving the EU only to stay locked in a customs union but that he wanted to protect the peace deal.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement that former Prime Minister Theresa May struck in November with the EU says the United Kingdom will remain in a customs union \u201cunless and until\u201d alternative arrangements are found to avoid a hard border.\n\nBut many British lawmakers oppose the prospect of being bound to EU rules and customs duties that would prevent Britain doing its own trade deals and leave it overseen by EU judges.\n\n\u201cWe would like to be able to vote for a deal and actually I\u2019m highly confident if Boris brings back a deal it will be a deal which he expects we\u2019ll want to support,\u201d said Steve Baker, chairman of a group of pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s Brexit in name only, I will vote against it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNON STARTER\u201d?\n\nUnder questioning, Johnson said there would have to be some checks on the island of Ireland \u2014 a step too far for Irish nationalists. Dublin has also consistently said that the border must remain seamless.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the reality,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBecause in the end, a sovereign, united country must have a single customs territory. When the UK withdraws from the EU that must be the state of affairs that we have.\u201d\n\nJohnson denied a report by Irish broadcaster RTE that there would have to be border posts 5-10 miles (8-16 km) back from the border. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney quipped such proposals would be a \u201cNon-Starter\u201d.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seen at the venue for the Conservative Party annual conference in Manchester, Britain, October 1, 2019. REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nMary Lou McDonald, president of Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein, said the reported proposal from Britain to set up \u201ccustoms clearance centres\u201d near the Irish border was absolutely not acceptable as it represented a hardening of the frontier.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re coming up to now is, as it were, the critical moment of choice for us as friends and partners about how we proceed,\u201d Johnson said.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson pitched new proposals on Tuesday for an amended Brexit agreement that would remove the contested insurance policy for the Irish border, but EU officials sounded sceptical about the chances of a breakthrough.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435793865&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF90252", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
