He spoke of working with European countries and planned to visit the United Arab Emirates, a close Saudi ally, before returning to Washington.\n\nThe State Department said in a statement after their meeting that Mr. Pompeo and Prince Mohammed had \u201cagreed that this was an unacceptable and unprecedented attack that not only threatened Saudi Arabian national security, but also endangered the lives of all the American citizens living and working in Saudi Arabia, as well as the world\u2019s energy supply in general.\u201d", "description": "The secretary of state\u2019s words were the strongest so far from any American official regarding the attack on Saudi oil facilities last weekend.", "authors": ["Ben Hubbard", "David D.
