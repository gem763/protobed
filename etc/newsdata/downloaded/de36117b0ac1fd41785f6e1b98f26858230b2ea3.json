I didn't leak that information. Me and my agent, we are not the ones who leaked that information.\"\n\nAs for why he made the trade request, he made it clear that winning is his first and only priority.\n\n\"All I care about is winning man, s--t,\" Ramsey added. \"Everybody knows that. I want to f--king win.\"\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter and Chris Mortensen reported Monday that Ramsey's agent, David Mulugheta, requested a trade for his client following Jacksonville's Week 2 loss to the Houston Texans. During that game, Ramsey had a heated sideline exchange with head coach Doug Marrone.\n\nMulugheta confirmed to Schefter that his client would like to be traded.\n\nAccording to Tom Pelissero of NFL Network, Ramsey has grown frustrated by how he is being used in Jacksonville, as he is not a fan of playing zone defense:\n\nRamsey previously told ESPN's Michael DiRocco (via ABC News) in November 2018 that he wanted to spend his entire career in Jacksonville. However, as the team has declined to extend him with just two years remaining on his rookie contract, his future there had come into question.\n\nEven with the latest twist, he says he will continue to be a professional.\n\n\"I have nothing bad or negative to say at all about anybody in this building,\" Ramsey added. \"... I don't really too much want to speak on it or give too much detail. I'mma let God do his work. I'mma let my agent do his work.\"\n\nRamsey also left no doubt as to his place in the NFL's cornerback hierarchy:\n\nJacksonville does not have ample time to get a deal done prior to Week 3, as it will host the Tennessee Titans on Thursday night. However, Schefter noted one league source is not ruling out the possibility that a trade happens this week:\n\nSchefter also reported the Jaguars are seeking \"at least one first-round pick.\" According to ESPN's Dianna Russini, Jacksonville has already been offered multiple packages that feature a first-round pick:\n\nThere should be no shortage of interest in a defensive back of his caliber as teams continue to air the ball out. After all, he is a two-time Pro Bowler and was named a first-team All-Pro in 2017\u2014and he is just 24 years old.", "description": "Jacksonville Jaguars  cornerback Jalen Ramsey saw his desire to be traded go public Monday, and on Tuesday he addressed the matter with the media:     \"Let's be clear about something,\" Ramsey told reporters...", "authors": ["Kyle Newport"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/828/593/hi-res-448ab84969c9f18e5092a4a85ee72c31_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
