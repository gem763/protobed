The services at present run 112 trains daily on routes between the U.K., France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nThe deal would \u201cherald a new era in the development of European high speed rail services,\u201d said Guillaume Pepy, the boss of SNCF \u2014 with the company adding it responds to \u201cthe challenge of climate change and Europe\u2019s growing demand for eco-responsible and sustainable travel.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince their creation, Eurostar and Thalys link Europeans across borders while respecting the environment. I welcome the SNCF and the launch of Project Green Speed: a great European initiative for more sustainable mobility, at high speed,\u201d France\u2019s Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said in a tweet.\n\nSNCF holds a majority stake in both Eurostar and Thalys.\n\nThe two services have been under pressure to reform their offerings, as low-cost players like Flixtrain enter the continental market. Deutsche Bahn also previously floated plans to compete with Eurostar by offering a Frankfurt-London service.\n\nThe European Commission in February blocked a merger between France\u2019s Alstom and Germany\u2019s Siemens over concerns of market dominance.", "description": "The plan would need the green light from EU competition officials.", "authors": ["Joshua Posaner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-840498330-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
