But halfway through our 17-miler in these 2-in-1 Kalenji running shorts and we\u2019d all but forgotten there was anything to worry about. They are by far the comfiest pair of shorts we tried, with a soft \u2013 but crucially seamless \u2013 inner short, which prevents any rubbing, and a lightweight outer layer made from breathable material, which helped keep us cool. We liked the addition of two fluorescent strips on the side, giving us that extra bit of confidence on our late-night run commutes home, while the zipped pocket in the waistband is 15cm x 7cm, easily fitting our phone, keys and debit card. We did need to use the drawstring when these shorts first arrived to ensure they fitted perfectly, but once we had done that we found they stayed in place throughout our runs. Plus, these are the cheapest pair we tried. We're sure you'll be racing to get a pair in no time.\n\nBuy now\n\nSweaty Betty challenge running shorts: \u00a350, Sweaty Betty\n\nIt may be better known for its yoga gear, but the brand\u2019s challenge running shorts are a fantastic addition to any runner\u2019s wardrobe. Made predominantly from polyester, the 2-in-1 style keeps you cool and comfortable, as the lightweight fabric of the outer layer wicks away sweat and dries fast, while the form-fitting inner short adds extra coverage and support. The wide waistband is flattering and ensures the shorts don\u2019t ride up mid-run. Certainly, the design seems to work; while some other shorts led to chafing in the hot weather, these prevented any discomfort (even during a heatwave). We tested a pair in black, which looked super stylish, but they are also available in beetle blue and a green camouflage pattern. Sizing ranges from XS to XL, with a small fitting a UK size 10 comfortably. Plus, Sweaty Betty\u2019s keen to be green campaign to reduce plastic waste and landfill means that they don\u2019t arrive in loads of plastic packaging. What\u2019s not to like?\n\nBuy now\n\nLululemon fast and free short: \u00a358, Lululemon\n\nYou may be mistaken for thinking that these shorts belong in the wardrobe of a cyclist and not a runner. Certainly, their form-fitting design and long leg wouldn't look out of place in the peloton. But we urge any runner keen to beat their PB to give these fast and free shorts a go. Described by the brand \u2013 which is well known for its high-quality kit and punchy designs \u2013 as \"barely-there-feeling shorts\", we found them extremely comfortable and surprisingly flattering. Unlike a lot of similar styles on the market, these shorts have a high waistband and a 6-inch inseam, so you feel well covered throughout, and they retain their shape, even after multiple washes. The brand's specialist fabric is lightweight and sweat-wicking, staying dry even at the end of a tough 10km in the sun. There's also plenty of storage including side drop-in pockets and a waistband pocket for nutrition. Available in five sizes, we found the shorts fitted comfortably round the waist and thigh (plus, there's always a drawcord if you want to adjust them). These are one of the most expensive pairs we tried \u2013 but when you get a PB in them, it's worth it, right?\n\nBuy now\n\nAdidas run it shorts: \u00a321.95, Adidas\n\nThese slim-fit run it shorts by Adidas are one of the cheapest pairs we tried \u2013 but don't let that put you off. In fact, they boast many of the same advantages as the other \u2013 more expensive \u2013 pairs, including technology to help keep your body dry by drawing sweat away from the skin and a draw-cord adjustable waist. As an added bonus, the reflective material also increases visibility in low light conditions, helping to keep you safe on those mid-week evening runs. With a leg length of four inches, they are a tad shorter than some of the other pairs, but still keep you covered. Plus, they are also available in pink and black. The only thing we found they are missing is a pocket so we'd recommend these for anyone who loves a shorter distance and who doesn't need to worry about storing fuel.\n\nBuy now\n\nOn running shorts: \u00a365, On\n\nSwiss brand On wanted to go back to basics with these shorts, bringing together modern-day technology with an old-school racing design \u2013 and what a result. These running shorts are ultralight, weighing just over 80g, and extremely fast-drying due to their stretchy polyamide and elastane material. They also offer good coverage due to their slightly longer leg while, at the rear of the shorts, there is a moisture-sealed pocket to hold your essentials and stop them bouncing around. On recommends these shorts for fast training, racing and warm weather running, but they were also our go-to pair for cross-training sessions in the gym. A tad more expensive than most of the other pairs, these were a close second for us \u2013 but we\u2019re sure we'll keep returning to them.\n\nBuy now\n\nRunderwear women\u2019s running long shorts: \u00a323, Runderwear\n\nRunderwear promises its shorts are \"chafe free, guaranteed\". It is a brave claim \u2013 but the brand knows what it\u2019s doing. Perhaps better known for its specialist underwear, its women\u2019s running long shorts provide high-levels of comfort and can be worn on their own or underneath another of your favourite pairs. The 360-degree seamless technology means you don\u2019t get any random rubbing on the lower back or thigh, while the moisture-wicking fabric removes sweat quickly and helped to regulate our body temperature (a crucial benefit when training in the heat). The longer length helps to protect the thighs and they offered a supportive fit. Predominantly made from polyamide, they also dry quickly and are easy to wash and care for. At just \u00a323, you can\u2019t go wrong.\n\nBuy now\n\nBam bamboo enduro shorts: \u00a314, BAM\n\nLaunched in 2006, Bam specialises in bamboo clothing. The crop is highly sustainable, so it's a good choice for any eco-friendly runners out there, while the benefits of bamboo fabric include a luxurious feel, moisture-wicking qualities and UV protection (perfect for those long summer days). It is perhaps unsurprising then that we loved the feel of the brand's bamboo enduro shorts, which are more like a second skin than a piece of gym kit. They were not only super soft to touch but stretchy and supportive, with a flattering cocktail print that garnered many a compliment in the gym changing room. We did find these shorts had a tendency to ride up a bit during runs, and the short style means they are perhaps for the braver runners out there, but we loved them, particularly for our yoga and strength and conditioning sessions. They are also great if you have sensitive skin, with the anti-static material keeping you fresh, dry and comfortable. Available in a UK size 8 to a size 16, we guarantee these will brighten up any runner's wardrobe.\n\nBuy now\n\nReebok meet you there shorts: \u00a322.95, Reebok\n\nReleased as part of Reebok's new autumn/winter campaign, the brand describes these meet you there shorts as being for \"individuals who break the standard\". We're not quite sure whether we fit that description \u2013 but we loved the \"go faster\" style design and were pleasantly surprised with the fit and comfort levels. We certainly didn't experience any rubbing, despite the shorter length, and found the shorts stayed dry even during the toughest of sprint sessions. Made from polyester, we also loved the fact they are available in extended-sizing, from XXS to XXL, as part of Reebok's desire to inspire everyone, everywhere.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Women's running shorts\n\nShorts are a key part of any runner's kit. Get it wrong and you'll end up uncomfortable and sweaty, with chafed inner thighs. Find the right pair and you'll stay cool and dry, leaving you to concentrate on topping that Strava leaderboard or finishing that marathon. We loved the comfort and design of the Kalenji dry+ 2 in 1 women\u2019s running shorts, even on long runs, but there are plenty of other great contenders to choose from. From On's sleek and stylish pair to Runderwear's chafe free long short, there really is a style to suit every runner.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
