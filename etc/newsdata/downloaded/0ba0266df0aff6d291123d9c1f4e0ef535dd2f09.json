Ralph Bestic\n\nWe wondered earlier this year if the sandalwood growers dragged into the implosion of Quintis had suffered enough. Alas, we hadn't known the half of it.\n\nIn late 2018, ex-Quintis chief Frank Wilson was the public face of the newly formed Sandalwood Growers Co-Op. It aimed to monetise the sandalwood Quintis' growers had spent decades cultivating. But ASIC would only approve the appointment of a responsible entity over the co-op if Wilson, the target of an ASIC civil action over an alleged lapse of disclosure at Quintis, agreed to step down as a director.\n\nHe's still closely involved on some levels though, as revealed by the spectacular unravelling late last month of a landmark sandalwood sale that had been secured by SGC.\n\nAn email sent to growers by responsible entity Huntley Asset Management on September 26 states that the principal of would-be sandalwood buyer AuSantal said he'd had \"some discussions with Mr Frank Wilson of SGC over the sale and had been allowed a brief viewing of the timber stored\".\n\nWilson rose to national prominence when he resigned as Quintis CEO shortly after an off-shore short-seller accused the company of being a Ponzi scheme. He did it to lead a takeover, which ultimately didn't eventuate. Earlier this year, the former WAFL footballer and tax lawyer lost a Supreme Court of Western Australia case over a loan. Justice Kenneth Martin described Wilson's testimony as \"unreliable, implausible, self-serving and inconsistent\", but his demeanour as \"highly self-assured\".", "description": "The more things change, the more they stay the same.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_187/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6a57608ad9284930750b83cbcb892d8b53b76ff8", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
