Without the support of these lawmakers, it would be nearly impossible for Giuseppe Conte\u2019s government to control a majority in both houses,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, head of London-based research firm Teneo.\n\nWhile Renzi has reassured Conte in a phone call that his loyalists will continue to support the fragile coalition government, the launch of a new centrist party will surely increase Italy\u2019s political uncertainty and put additional pressure on the struggling Democrats\u2019 leader, Nicola Zingaretti.\n\n\u201cRenzi\u2019s past record of political double-dealing casts a large shadow on his claim that his new party will strengthen the government,\u201d Piccoli said.\n\nRenzi may well decide to withdraw his party\u2019s support to Conte\u2019s ruling coalition whenever he believes that would suit him, exercising pressure on the new cabinet, which is already split on key economic measures and policy issues.\n\nPolitical observers noted it\u2019s unlikely that Renzi would bring down the government in the short term. However, his sudden move will make the government\u2019s agenda even more complicated, as it will have to meet the demands of another political force just to stay afloat.\n\nRenzi is expected to unveil the name and the details of his new political party at the annual gathering of his supporters in Florence on Oct. 18-20.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former Italian Premier Matteo Renzi has left the ruling Democratic Party to set up a new centrist force, in a risky move that further weakens the already shaky government forged only two weeks ago by the center-left Democrats and the populist 5-Star Movement.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Giada Zampano"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/italy_politics_61066_c0-296-7082-4425_s1770x1032.jpg?252e8d72efb4f761a1dc9b0b532e532b8a86c24b", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
