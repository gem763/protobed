Yet very few criminals get caught, let alone charged,\u201d said Mr Allen.\n\nHis figures, from 39 of the 44 police forces, show prosecutions have fallen by 70 per cent since 2015 to just 20 last year, despite a 20 per cent rise in the number of dog thefts from 1,545 in 2015 to 1,849 in 2018.", "description": "Dogs may be our best friends and their unwavering loyalty priceless but thefts of them are not being pursued by police because most are worth under \u00a3500 and so rated a minor low level crime, say campaigners.", "authors": ["Charles Hymas", "Home Affairs Editor", "Allister Heath", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Stephen Bush"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/25/TELEMMGLPICT000210877345-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
