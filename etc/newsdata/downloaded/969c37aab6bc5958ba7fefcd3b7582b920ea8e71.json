(Kena Betancur / AFP)KENA BETANCUR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Jesus Manuel Corona, the sleek Mexican winger known as Tecatito, breezed by his U.S. counterpart, Christian Pulisic, before touching the ball between Sergi\u00f1o Dest\u2019s legs.\n\nA green mass rose in anticipation.\n\nCorona chipped a cross to Mexico\u2019s all-time leading scorer, Javier \u201cChicharito\u201d Hernandez, whom the Americans neglected to mark. The eight-yard header was strong and true.\n\nThe opening salvo in Friday\u2019s friendly between regional soccer adversaries was symbolic of Mexico\u2019s current superiority in the searing rivalry and initiated a 3-0 victory before 47,960 at MetLife Stadium.\n\n[The U.S.-Mexico soccer rivalry endures, even with more reps and lower stakes]\n\nEl Tri was confident and electric, not just on that pivotal sequence but throughout 90 minutes. The Americans were forced into errors, slow to keep pace and outclassed all night.\n\nThe match carried no great meaning, other than to demonstrate the difference between the programs about a year before qualifying for the 2022 World Cup commences.\n\nThe pro-Mexican crowd celebrated a second victory over the United States in two months, following the Concacaf Gold Cup championship in Chicago.\n\nIn putting his stamp on the team, U.S. Coach Gregg Berhalter wants to initiate attacks out of the back. But when put under pressure, his team gave away the ball too often to the Mexicans, who created opportunities in a flash and threatened multiple times before halftime. Hernandez scored in the 21st minute for his 52nd international goal.\n\n[USMNT roster mixes in some new (and some who?) for friendlies vs. Mexico and Uruguay]\n\nThe Americans were better composed in the second half but lacked the sophistication and expertise to rattle the Mexicans, who are 10-0-1 since former Atlanta United coach Gerardo Martino took charge in January.\n\nThe second goal was the result of Hernandez\u2019s pressure on Zack Steffen in the 78th minute. The goalkeeper\u2019s clearance was disrupted just outside the penalty area and fell to Erick Gutierrez for a clean finish from the top of the box.\n\nFour minutes later, Hirving Lozano torched Alfredo Morales on the counter and set up Uriel Antuna (Los Angeles Galaxy) for the third goal.\n\nJonathan Orozco preserved the shutout, stopping Josh Sargent\u2019s penalty kick in the 88th minute.\n\nThe next U.S. match is Tuesday against Uruguay in St. Louis.\n\nDest, 18, made his senior national team debut, starting at left back and logging 67 minutes. The Dutch-born dual national, who has been starting for European power Ajax, still has the option to play for the Netherlands.\n\nThe first chance for Berhalter to lock him in for good is in the next official FIFA competition, a Nations League match Oct. 11 against Cuba at Washington\u2019s Audi Field.\n\nRead more:\n\nD.C.
