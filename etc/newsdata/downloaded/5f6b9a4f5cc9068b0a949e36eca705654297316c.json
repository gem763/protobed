If there is very short notice, for example, it might be an issue if a hall is being used by an amateur dramatic society,\u201d said Laura Lock, thedeputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators (AEA).\n\n\u201cBut the bigger issue we are finding is with count centres. We know of at least one case where both their first and second choices have been both booked for Christmas parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t let them in without cancelling the Christmas events. In the case of a sports centre doing that, for example, we can only pay the normal rental. We can\u2019t pay them for the loss of income.\u201d\n\nJohnson is sure he would win an election. A closer look at the polls says otherwise | Ell Smith Read more\n\nThe looming Christmas period is also having an effect on costs such as those for the rental of PA and staging equipment, which are also in demand for other events. There is a ceiling of \u00a3800 of funding from the government for staging and PA expenses, but costs are expected to be in excess of that in many parts of the country as Christmas approaches.\n\nMajor local authorities who are keeping a close eye on the situation include Birmingham city council, which organises the counts for a number of constituencies across a large area. When the snap election was called in 2017, neither the Birmingham\u2019s National Indoor Arena or the International Convention Centre were available and six separate venues had to be hired as result.\n\nElsewhere, Southampton city council said: \u201cUntil an election is called, the date is unknown and therefore accommodation/locations cannot be confirmed and will be subject to their availability at that time. It is hoped that in such an event the O2 Guildhall will be free.\u201d\n\nOther local authorities, such as Sheffield city council, had been making provisional bookings.\n\nQuick guide How do I register for a postal or proxy vote in the UK? Show Hide There are two ways to vote if you can\u2019t be there on the day of an election: a postal vote or a proxy vote. To apply you must already be registered to vote. Voting by proxy A proxy vote means you nominate someone to vote on your behalf. Anyone can do this provided they are registered to vote and allowed to vote in the same type of election. You need to apply at least six working days before election day if you want to vote in England, Scotland or Wales. There are different forms to fill in depending on the reason you want the proxy vote, which can be: You will be away.\n\nYou will be at work.\n\nYou will be attending a course.\n\nYou are disabled.\n\nYou are living overseas.\n\nYou are serving overseas as a member of the armed forces.\n\nYou are a British Council employee or crown servant (for example diplomatic or overseas civil service). There\u2019s a completely different form to apply to vote by proxy in Northern Ireland, where you need to apply at least 14 working days before election day. Voting by post Anyone registered to vote in an election can apply for a postal vote. You do not need to give a reason. If you live in England, Scotland or Wales you need to fill in this form and then send it to your local electoral registration office. If you want to vote by post in Northern Ireland, you need to follow the instructions here from the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland. These need to arrive in good time before the election. Which is best? It is up to you, depending on your personal circumstances, but with heightened expectation that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, will call a snap general election, administrators are advising people to consider a proxy vote. They want to avoid a repeat of the debacle in May when postal votes arrived too late to be counted for the European parliamentary elections. Getting help If you need help, you should contact your local electoral registration office. You can use this service to find its address if you live in England, Scotland or Wales. If you live in Northern Ireland you need to contact the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland.\n\nDespite the challenges, Lock insisted that administrators would deliver, despite having to put their own holiday and other plans on hold.\n\n\u201cPeople will deliver. That said, we have a print industry that does not have infinite capacity and we are talking about millions and millions of documents that have to be counted in a short space of time,\u201d she said.\n\nUnder the current provisions, parliament will have to be dissolved 25 working days before voters go to the polls if an election is called. From the point when parliament is dissolved, politicians cease to be MPs and will campaign for re-election \u2013 if they choose to stand again.\n\nLock\u2019s association has called on the government to carry out a risk assessment of the UK\u2019s ability to hold a snap general election.\n\nThe AEA said that it had \u201cgenuine concerns\u201d about the expectation that elections would always be safely delivered regardless of the landscape, timing, funding or capacity of people delivering them.\n\n\u201cThis view is becoming unrealistic,\u201d it warned in a report, which highlighted \u201congoing uncertainty surrounding electoral events\u201d.\n\nThe administrators said they were concerned that an apparent lack of capacity and \u201cthe government\u2019s unwillingness to allow officials to engage with the electoral community to make sensible contingency preparations will continue to introduce significant risk to the delivery of unscheduled polls.\u201d", "description": "Electoral administrators struggle to find venues to serve as count centres and polling stations", "authors": ["Ben Quinn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bf2939c250ccf6e5f6b589b3dffd8eb39775168/0_290_5583_3351/master/5583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9f986f58fb108be0ab69bba92acb332c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
