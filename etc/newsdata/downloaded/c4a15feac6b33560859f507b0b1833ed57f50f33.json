Sell-Side Sentiment Solid After Alphabet's Q3 Earnings Disappoint", "language": "en", "text": "Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) shares dipped 2% on Tuesday after the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings report fell short of Wall Street expectations.\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent company reported third-quarter EPS of $10.12, below consensus estimates of $12.42. Revenue of $40.5 billion and traffic acquisition costs of $7.49 billion were roughly in-line with estimates.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts have weighed in on Alphabet stock since the earnings report. Here\u2019s a sampling of what they\u2019ve had to say.\n\nBusiness As Usual\n\nKeyBanc analyst Andy Hargreaves said revenue growth was solid, but operating expenses weighed on profitability.\n\n\u201c3Q results showed excellent core Sites ad revenue and continued strong growth in GCP, which, along with other significant growth opportunities, suggests the potential for sustained strong revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future,\u201d Hargreaves wrote in a note.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said the quarter was another demonstration of Alphabet\u2019s \u201cstaple-like\u201d ecosystem.\n\n\u201cGOOGL\u2019s 3Q results \u2013 21% Y/Y ex-FX websites growth in line with us and $9.7bn of GAAP EBIT (excluding a $554mn legal charge we hadn\u2019t modelled) 3% higher than expected \u2013 showcase the continued durability of GOOGL\u2019s top-line even through laws of large numbers,\u201d Nowak wrote.\n\nNomura Instinet analyst Mark Kelley said the quarter was mixed, but Alphabet didn\u2019t report anything out of the ordinary.\n\n\u201cWe view this quarter as business as usual, and with several new and under-monetized products (Maps, Shopping and Feed) able to contribute over the long term, we remain positive,\u201d Kelley wrote.\n\nFiring On All Cylinders\n\nRaymond James analyst Aaron Kessler said Google continued its momentum in cloud, mobile and YouTube in the third quarter.\n\nView more earnings on GOOG\n\n\u201cGAAP operating income of $9.2B was 2.1/2.6% below our/Street estimate of $9.4B/$9.4B due to higher legal costs (excluding this, operating would have beaten street by ~3%),\u201d Kessler wrote.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald said that despite the EPS miss, Alphabet still offers investors 20% revenue growth at a relatively low multiple and exposure to potential long-term Other Bets catalysts.\n\n\u201cWhile not sensational, we view 3Q performance as confirming the solid momentum re-established in 2Q,\u201d Fitzgerald wrote.\n\nBank of America analyst Justin Post said Google made some impressive progress on key technology in the quarter, and the numbers would have looked a lot better if not for one-time items.\n\n\u201cOn the call, Google\u2019s CEO indicated that Google developed new neural network-based technique for natural language processing could be the biggest advance for search in five years, and a major Quantum Computing milestone, which is pretty unusual for an earnings call and potentially bullish,\u201d Post said.\n\nRatings And Price Targets\n\nWells Fargo has an Outperform rating and $1,400 target.\n\nMorgan Stanley has an Overweight rating and $1,450 target.\n\nNomura Instinet has a Buy rating and $1,560 target.\n\nBank of America has a Buy rating and $1,450 target.\n\nRaymond James has an Outperform rating and a $1,465 target.\n\nKeyBanc has an Overweight rating and $1,546 target.\n\nGOOGL shares traded around $1,265.41 at time of publication.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take\n\nThe numbers may not have been as good as Alphabet bulls had hoped, but they certainly weren\u2019t bad enough to impact the long-term thesis for the stock. Wall Street analysts remain bullish on Google virtually across the board.\n\nDo you agree with this take?
