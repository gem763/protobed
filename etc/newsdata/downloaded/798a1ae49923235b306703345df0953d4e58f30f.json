The draw prevented Klopp\u2019s side from matching City\u2019s record of 18 successive league wins and providing a welcome confidence boost for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side after a testing start to the season.\n\nKlopp was left complaining about Martin Atkinson\u2019s decision not to award a foul on Divock Origi by the defender Victor Lindel\u00f6f just before Rashford gave United the lead in the 36th minute.\n\nThe VAR official David Coote, who saw his decision to award a goal for Aston Villa\u2019s Conor Hourihane against Brighton overturned by VAR the previous day, decided no foul had been committed.\n\nLiverpool drop first points but Lallana strike denies Manchester United Read more\n\n\u201cThis is an issue we have to discuss,\u201d said the Liverpool manager. \u201cThe process [allows] the ref to make the decision or not because they have VAR. The ref thinks: \u2018Let it run \u2013 we have VAR.\u2019 But then VAR says it can\u2019t be overruled because it was not clear. How can he say it\u2019s not a foul? I was 100% sure. I said, \u2018Wow.\u2019 I was not angry, I was surprised. I think everyone can agree it was a foul but with VAR it is not a clear foul. That is the situation.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t lose but it was an obvious foul. There was clear contact and Divock Origi goes down. They carried on and counterattacked. Yes, there is contact, I\u2019m sure they said that but it is not a \u2018clear foul\u2019. That doesn\u2019t work. That\u2019s just not how it should be.\u201d\n\nSolskj\u00e6r took the opposing view when asked if it was an infringement. \u201cNo chance \u2013 we\u2019re not playing basketball. It\u2019s never a foul. I don\u2019t think Keano [Roy Keane] would say that\u2019s a foul. I thought the referee needs praising. It\u2019s not often we do that. He let it be a derby game, it wasn\u2019t like you couldn\u2019t touch anyone.\u201d\n\nSadio Man\u00e9 looked to have equalised just before half-time but this time VAR disallowed the finish, with replays showing the forward clearly handled before scoring past David de Gea. Klopp had no problem with this decision and admitted he had been relieved to maintain their unbeaten start to the season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sadio Man\u00e9 had a goal disallowed.

Then we scored the goal [Adam Lallana\u2019s late equaliser] and was in charge of the game. The stadium was silent and people probably thought Liverpool would score but we take the point and move on.\u201d\n\nSolskj\u00e6r fielded a 3-4-1-2 formation that wrested the initiative from Liverpool though Klopp claimed United were set up to defend first.\n\n\u201cWe were good enough for a point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe gave Man United an opportunity to play the way they wanted to play with five at the back. They were hard-working. Our orientation wasn\u2019t good enough. We felt under pressure when we weren\u2019t and could have turned inside at some opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe always play against the wall. We need to do better but it is how it is. I don\u2019t think Man Utd can play like this if the other team doesn\u2019t have the ball as much. We play very often against a team like this. Maybe we can do better. One point is completely fine.\u201d\n\nAndreas Pereira embodies Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s brave tactics for muscular United | Jamie Jackson Read more\n\nSolskj\u00e6r disagreed again. \u201cWe set the team up to attack and be aggressive and create chances and we did that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt depends on what you call a counterattack. We\u2019re better when we attack quickly, no dilly-dallying, [it] doesn\u2019t have to be a counterattack.\n\n\u201cI spoke about it before the game - take more risks, be braver - it\u2019s the right type of football, and being more direct helped us.\u201d\n\nThis was, though, a 21st time in the last 24 outings United had scored only once. \u201cGetting the second goal [is what we have to do],\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cWe had two or three great opportunities to score, we soaked up the pressure well but didn\u2019t create enough ourselves and that\u2019s the next level. We\u2019re not excited about getting a point against a good team.\u201d", "description": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp railed at the VAR decision that failed to rule a \u2018clear foul\u2019 in the buildup to Marcus Rashford\u2019s goal as Liverpool surrendered their 100% record in a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df74c12e27db693aec0a6dd97ebcb3c10da58ca2/879_253_1967_1181/master/1967.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c4c2972775d0371781724d46568bc7f", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
