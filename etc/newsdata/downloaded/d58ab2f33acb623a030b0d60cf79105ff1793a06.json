It represents a stark difference from lower down the mountain, where Curiosity discovered evidence of persistent freshwater lakes.\n\nGale Crater is the ancient remnant of a massive impact. Sediment carried by water and wind eventually filled in the crater floor, layer by layer. Each layer reveals a different era of Martian history and holds clues about the prevailing environment at the time, according to NASA.\n\nGiven that the Earth and Mars were similar in their early days, Rapin speculated that Sutton Island might have resembled saline lakes on South America's Altiplano.\n\nCuriosity landed near Mount Sharp in the Gale Crater on Mars in August 2012 and reached the base of the mountain in 2014. It has since traversed through a diversity of environments where both water and wind have left their imprint.", "description": "NASA's Curiosity rover has discovered rocks on Mars enriched in mineral salts, which was believed to be evidence of shallow briny Martian ponds that went through episodes of overflow and drying, according to a Nature Geoscience paper published on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9d7f52a310cf3e97a04b80.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
