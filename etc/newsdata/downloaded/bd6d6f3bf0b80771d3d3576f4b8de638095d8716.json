He was carrying more weight physically than he ever has coming into a race. He gave 20 pounds away to most of the field and he ran a track record. He can\u2019t go any faster or any better.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just the same horse that he was. Obviously he\u2019s a little bit older but I still believe he\u2019s got another good season left in him and I think he showed that first-up. There\u2019s no reason why he can\u2019t continue on his way.\u201d\n\nBeauty Generation faces a similar scenario again in this contest \u2013 another under handicap conditions \u2013 and given his standing as the equal highest-rated horse in Hong Kong racing history (alongside Able Friend), he\u2019s giving his rivals plenty of weight.\n\nThe seven-year-old carries 133 pounds with Rise High the next in line lumping 119 pounds while six are on the minimum of 113.\n\nTwo of those horses with the feather weight pose the only real challenge according to Purton \u2013 Waikuku and Ka Ying Star \u2013 with both finishing in the placings behind Beauty Generation first-up.\n\nThey are making the transition to Group racing after competing in last season\u2019s four-year-old series and still potentially have some upside, while Beauty Generation has already shown he\u2019s got the others covered.\n\n\u201c[The weight] is always a concern because we\u2019ve always got nice young horses coming through every season,\u201d Purton said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much horses are going to improve with the benefit of the off-season and getting in with such a light weight, if they\u2019re talented horses, they\u2019re always hard to hold out.\n\n\u201cBut my bloke is an iron horse, he\u2019s worked well since, he\u2019s really good. He\u2019s drawn a nice gate, he should get a nice run.\u201d\n\nBeauty Generation has the versatility to control the race from the front or take a sit, so if someone does want to take up the running, Purton can adjust however it unfolds.\n\n\u201cLike I always say, the more pressure the better. The old horses can\u2019t absorb or handle that pressure and he eats it up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA nice, genuinely run race is what we\u2019re looking for and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to go out there and give us his best again.\u201d\n\nBeauty Generation is chasing his third straight victory in the Oriental Watch Sha Tin Trophy and will start a long odds-on favourite again.", "description": "Champion jockey Zac Purton expects Hong Kong superstar Beauty Generation to collect his 11th straight victory in Sunday\u2019s Group Two Oriental Watch Sha Tin Trophy (1,600m) with the weight differential to a couple of up-and-comers the only minor concern....", "authors": ["Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/19/bff35656-f244-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_160133.JPG?itok=4nHmCzPj&v=1571472101", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
