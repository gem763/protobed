It\u2019s not coming down,\u201d he concluded.\n\nIn an effort to gain community support, Lemonis launched a petition that received thousands of signatures.\n\n\u201cThis is about more than just the flag. This is about our Veterans, Military, and the men and women that have sacrificed for this great country. They are the reason we fly the flag, and they are the reason we will NOT take it down!\u201d the petition read.\n\nOn Monday, Lemonis expressed thanks to his supporters on Twitter.\n\nThank you to all that felt the need to support. @cityofsvl has great people and I will continue to support. Would love to donate the same size flag to downtown Statesville. https://t.co/J97TL9ijln \u2014 Marcus Lemonis (@marcuslemonis) October 7, 2019\n\nReports said that although the city council voted against changing the city ordinance in June, they reversed their decision on Monday and unanimously agreed to allow Lemonis to keep the flag up.\n\nIn a June press release, Statesville Mayor Costi Kutteh said the city had received much bad publicity after news spread of Lemonis\u2019 refusal to remove the flag.\n\n\u201cSome terrible things have been said about our wonderful town, and it hasn\u2019t come from our citizens,\u201d Kutteh said. \u201cBut people from all over the country have jumped on this issue and called us names I can\u2019t repeat. When our community\u2019s efforts to conduct business in an orderly, lawful manner begins to hurt our businesses, then it\u2019s time to put a stop to it.\u201d", "description": "A\u00a0giant American flag will remain flying over a TV star's RV dealership in Statesville, North Carolina, after the city told him to remove it.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/american-flag-waving-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
