Another force now attends only half of its burglary scenes \u2013 down from nine in ten a few years ago.\n\nAn analysis of control room data from Bedfordshire and Nottinghamshire \u2013 carried out at the request of the two forces by crime experts Crest Advisory \u2013 found that the average proportion of incidents responded to has plunged from 67 per cent in 2014 to just 58 per cent last year.\n\nAgainst a background of growing \u2018Wild West Britain\u2019 violence, 999 operators are trying to close cases down immediately on the phone rather than sending officers to investigate [File photo]\n\nIn Bedfordshire, attendance at burglaries has fallen from 94 per cent to 52 per cent, and for anti-social behaviour from 46 per cent to 37 per cent.\n\nThe force has admitted: \u2018An ambition is for telephone resolution to become the default option, and where positive justification is required to deploy an officer (the reverse of the present approach).\u2019\n\nMost control rooms \u2013 handling 999 and non-emergency 101 calls \u2013 now have special units that try to resolve incidents over the phone, with forces around the country giving updates that reflect a new approach to policing.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said: \u2018Communication department staff finalise 47.6 per cent of all incidents at the first point of contact, without the need to deploy a resource.\u2019\n\nThe West Mercia force said it now resolves 43 per cent of incidents without deploying officers.\n\nThames Valley Police said: \u2018Attendance has dropped from 55 per cent of incidents in 2013/14 to 45 per cent in 2017/18.\n\nTelephone resolutions have increased by 19 per cent during the same period.\u2019\n\nMerseyside Police responded to 47 per cent of incidents reported with emergency or priority response \u2013 with the rest either resolved on the phone or left for another day.\n\nPolice are failing to visit victims of crime in half of all cases, shocking new figures reveal. An investigation by The Mail on Sunday into forces across the country has uncovered a dramatic fall in the number of emergency calls responded to by officers [File photo]\n\nDevon & Cornwall Police said of its call handlers: \u2018The over-arching aim of first contact resolution is to resolve the optimum number of requests for service at the first point of contact without the need to deploy unnecessary and inappropriate resources.\u2019\n\nA spokesman for Bedfordshire Police defended the policy, saying: \u2018The sheer lack of resources means that difficult decisions are already having to be made on a daily basis with regard to concentrating on those offences with the greatest risk of threat and harm.\u2019\n\nBut London Police and Crime Committee member Susan Hall said: \u2018When a victim of crime contacts police, they want justice, not to be fobbed off with a phone call. I welcome the Government funding significant increases in police officer numbers and I hope this will improve the situation.\u2019\n\nVictims\u2019 Commissioner Dame Vera Baird QC said: \u2018I find these figures very worrying. Where a caller is hurt, frightened or vulnerable there needs to be face-to- face contact.\n\n\u2018Reporting a crime is not a transactional exercise \u2013 it\u2019s not like claiming for accidental damage on your insurance. Face-to-face contact with officers can provide reassurance. It gives a sense that you are not alone.\u2019", "description": "An investigation by The Mail on Sunday into forces across the country has uncovered a dramatic fall in the number of emergency calls responded to by officers.", "authors": ["Martin Beckford For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/00/19941228-0-image-a-31_1571528878525.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
