This was when Dylan was writing Blonde on Blonde. \u201cThe television was on. There was music playing. The phone was ringing. There were people coming and going \u2013 and he was writing away on his typewriter. I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t even understand how somebody can close off the outside world like that and concentrate. This guy is from another planet,\u2019\u201d Robertson says. But for a while he shared that planet, or came as close to sharing it as any musician did at the time.\n\nRobertson was the lead guitarist of the Band (then known as The Hawks), the five-piece group that backed Dylan when he first went electric: essentially, they supplied the noise that the acoustic-loving crowds booed on tour. But while the collaboration changed the course of music history, it had another, quieter and more personal effect on the Band, shifting the dynamics of what Robertson calls their \u201cbrotherhood\u201d, the way the five of them related.\n\nThis \u201cbrotherhood\u201d is clearly on Robertson\u2019s mind, because after a lifetime of writing steadfastly unautobiographical songs, the most powerful track on his new solo album, Sinematic, mourns the demise of his band family \u2013 three of whom are dead. His new documentary, Once Were Brothers, which shares its title with that song, sees Robertson pottering around his music room, looking back on what made the Band tick as a collective, and what he lost in losing them. It is fair to say he is in a memoiristic phase.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Band at Woodstock, 1968 (from left): Richard Manuel, Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Rick Danko.

I would put our story up against any musical group in the history of the world.\u201d\n\nEric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, Van Morrison, Martin Scorsese (the film\u2019s executive producer) and George Harrison \u2013 as well as Dylan \u2013 are among the greats happy to say how great the Band, and Robertson in particular, were. Clapton even disbanded Cream \u2013 whose sound had become increasingly strident \u2013 after he heard their debut album, Music From Big Pink, in 1968, with its quiet, homespun roots air. But while Robertson\u2019s music with the Band has touched the work of so many important musicians, he is still mostly regarded as interesting for whom he influenced rather than in his own right, like a person who has many claims to fame, but somehow isn\u2019t a celebrity himself.\n\nI wonder if he minds being of interest primarily for music that he made so long ago, for his relationship to, and impact on, other, more famous, musicians. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of the journey and a big part of the story, and I completely understand that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not what I do. It\u2019s what I did.\u201d\n\nRobertson was born in Toronto. His mother, who was Mohawk, had grown up on the Six Nations of the Grand River Reserve, and as a child he used to visit family there. \u201cIt seemed to me that everybody played a musical instrument or sang or danced. I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve got to get in on this club!\u2019 I said, \u2018I think a guitar looks pretty cool.\u2019\u201d So his mother bought him one \u2013 with a cowboy painted on it. \u201cI thought it was very ironic that Indians would teach me to play guitar with a picture of a cowboy on.\u201d\n\nBy 15 he was proficient enough to be hanging around rockabilly Ronnie Hawkins when he played in Toronto, captivated by Levon Helm on drums, sticks flying, white hair blazing and only three years Robertson\u2019s senior. \u201cHe seemed to glow in the dark,\u201d Robertson says. Robertson was an only child; Helm became a kind of sibling. \u201cWith Levon I was the younger brother, learning and growing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bob Dylan and Robbie Robertson go electric at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia in 1966. Photograph: Charlie Steiner/Getty Images\n\nFellow Canadians Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson joined the band to complete the brotherhood, and after they split from Hawkins, they continued to play as Levon and the Hawks. Helm was the nominal leader, Hudson was classically trained and reclusive, Danko good-looking and soulful, and Manuel from the start was cherished as sensitive and vulnerable: \u201cFrom a very young age, we understood that Richard had a difficulty with alcohol and addiction,\u201d Robertson says. (Manuel killed himself when he was 42.) And what of Robertson? What part did he play in the brotherhood?\n\n\u201cEverybody did something that raised the level of what we were doing to a stronger place,\u201d he says. His \u201csomething\u201d was \u201cthe main part of the creative direction of where this group would go.\u201d He became less of a brother and more of an adult in the room. He negotiated with the band\u2019s manager \u2013 Albert Grossman, whom they shared with Dylan \u2013 took a growing charge of the songwriting and, as Danko, Helm and Manuel became increasingly interested in heroin, he tried to keep them focused on music.\n\nIt must have been tough to play both parent and brother. Didn\u2019t it create a sense of difference between him and his bandmates? After all, Helm was critical of Robertson in his 1993 autobiography, This Wheel\u2019s on Fire, for the way he distributed songwriting credits (Robertson got most of them). \u201cI didn\u2019t feel any separate feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat everybody gravitated to was what they could bring to the table. So they leaned on me, in the best sense of the expression, to really take care of business.\u201d\n\nIn his 2016 memoir, Testimony, Robertson writes about his parents\u2019 alcoholism, and that of his wife Dominique (now ex-wife, but they remain close and both live in LA, as do their children). He also logs the uses and abuses of his bandmates, especially Danko, Manuel and Helm\u2019s use of heroin. Did he try it? \u201cYeah, it wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you smoke grass or take a psychedelic or if you did coke or anything, you were in no position to be scolding anybody.\n\nEarly starter \u2026 Robbie Robertson.\n\n\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t know anybody that didn\u2019t do drugs. It was such a normal. But what I did discover was that when it got in the way of what I wanted to do, when [I felt] \u2018Holy \u2013 ! I\u2019m going to die if I keep living this way,\u2019 I went in the other direction. My addiction was work.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAnd still is,\u201d he adds. He has a habit of bringing his recollections back to the present, and for someone who celebrates a love of storytelling, his enjoyment seems rather ambivalent. I can\u2019t help feeling there is only so far he wants to go.\n\nRobertson also regards Dylan as \u201cstill part of the brotherhood\u201d. He was 22 when they met. They became so close that Robertson was the only witness to Dylan\u2019s wedding to Sara Lownds in 1965. And then, of course, there were the electric tours, all those angry audiences. \u201cIt was like we went through the war together,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in it for ever, just because of what we went through.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen people boo you night after night, it can affect your confidence. Anybody else would have said, \u2018Well, the audience isn\u2019t liking this, let\u2019s change what we\u2019re doing.\u2019 We didn\u2019t budge. We went out there and just played this music and the more they booed, the louder we got. Inside of us we felt, \u2018This is a revolution. And we\u2019re part of this revolution, and we\u2019re going to go through with it.\u201d Later, of course, came The Basement Tapes \u2013 weeks of laidback, lumberjack-shirted recordings with Dylan from the Band\u2019s Woodstock home.\n\nIn this light, Dylan\u2019s contribution to Robertson\u2019s documentary \u2013 the Band were \u201cgallant knights\u201d for standing behind him \u2013 seems slight. But Robertson says it is \u201cextraordinary\u201d that he contributed at all. \u201cBob doesn\u2019t do anything like this, ever.\u201d\n\nThe two are no longer close. Robertson was the only member of the Band not to feature in Dylan\u2019s 30th anniversary celebration in Madison Square Gardens in 1993. He was \u201cin somewhere else\u201d, he says, as if that were a place.\n\nAnd although a few years ago he and Dylan ran into each other at an event and \u201ccaught up a bit\u201d, they have less in common now. \u201cHe\u2019s always on the road, and I\u2019m never on the road. He\u2019s out there, and I think that keeps the blood flowing for him, and I admire that very much. But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m interested in \u2026 I haven\u2019t talked to him in a long time.\u201d\n\nAfter Dylan watched Once Were Brothers, so he could sign the release, \u201che called me and said, \u2018My God, I started watching this, and I got completely hooked. I love this film!\u2019\u201d He especially liked the part where Robertson talks about his mother, whom Dylan also knew (the two musicians lunched with each other\u2019s mothers: \u201cI know!\u201d Robertson says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like we would be the type!\u201d) Now he and Dylan \u201chave got an idea that we might pursue together, so we\u2019ll see what happens\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I said, guys, I\u2019m not going back on tour with you. I had this fear inside\u2019 ... Robbie Robertson. Photograph: David Jordan Williams\n\nRobertson has just finished the music for Scorsese\u2019s new film, The Irishman. Sinematic was released this month, he is writing the second volume of his autobiography and assembling the 50th anniversary collection of the Band, out in November. \u201cI\u2019m not lazy!\u201d he exclaims, a realisation he describes as \u201ca wake-up call\u201d but he sounds happy to be busy, and I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s news to him.\n\n\u201cI am so into what I am doing now,\u201d he says. \u201cI do revisit special things in my heart about this brotherhood. But I\u2019m very much, like, 90% of it is what I\u2019m doing today and what I need to do tomorrow. I\u2019m always wanting to move forward.\u201d\n\nIt was Robertson who organised the Band\u2019s farewell concert, The Last Waltz, in 1976, partly, he says, \u201cbecause of my deep concerns for Richard [Manuel]\u2019s wellbeing. It was shattering to me when Richard died. I was afraid of this for many years. The idea was to be protective. Because although we were all riding in the caravan, some people were much more vulnerable to the disease of addiction than others.\u201d\n\nDylan, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Van Morrison and others contributed to the show, which Scorsese also filmed \u2013 the start of a long working relationship. Robertson hoped that afterwards the Band would regroup in the studio. But he was the only one to turn up. He has always depicted the end of the Band as a surprise \u2013 but this seems at odds with the concept of a supremely elaborate farewell concert.\n\n\u201cOur plan was we were going to put the road aside, to take a break. And then, as I said in the film, when I realised everybody forgot to come back, I had to read the writing on the wall,\u201d he says.\n\nThat word \u201cforgot\u201d feels like a bit of a narrative liberty. After all, the other members of the Band reunited in 1983. Even after Manuel died in 1986, Hudson, Helm and Danko carried on \u2013 without Robertson. So didn\u2019t he leave them? \u201cThey got in touch and said, \u2018We want to go out and do some playing, and is it OK that we use the name the Band?\u2019 Because they didn\u2019t have a creative outlet like me.\u201d By then Robertson was writing music for film.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Guys, go ahead. If you want to go in and make a beautiful record, I\u2019m first in line. But I\u2019m not going back on the road with you.\u2019 I knew what was going on with Richard, Rick and Levon, still. And I had this fear inside. It could be dark. And it could be dangerous. And as it turned out, it was.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t help wondering whether memoir is a way to self-soothe, to sort through the difficult circumstances that led to the Band\u2019s demise, the pain of the distance from Helm in particular towards the end of his life. But Robertson sounds perplexed by the question. He says he is only celebrating their amazing journey.\n\nThe other living member of the brotherhood is Hudson, who is 82 and lives in Woodstock. Archive audio of his voice features in this documentary, but no new interview. \u201cGarth is a recluse and he doesn\u2019t talk,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cHe has a health issue. I don\u2019t think it would be respectful to Garth to show that he is not feeling that well, and to not be able to show him in a shining light.\u201d\n\nSo it falls to Robertson to tell the Band\u2019s story and, by telling it, to own it. Does this inequality with his brothers trouble him, especially since at its heart the Band was a celebration of the collective?\n\n\u201cInequality to the other guys?\u201d he asks, sounding puzzled. \u201cLike I said, early on they just kind of pushed me out there and said, \u2018Tell them what we\u2019re trying to say.\u2019 And because I was the creative writer in this group, and I also have the ability to \u2026 whatever you call it ... lead the charge, everybody enjoyed that I would take that responsibility. That I would do the dirty work in that way. So it fell on me. It fell on me and I respect it and I try to tell the most honest version of the story I can.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fair point, yet for a memoirist, he seems pretty averse to reflection. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get moopy or soppy or mushy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the cloth I\u2019m cut from.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Robbie Robertson\u2019s album Sinematic and documentary Once Were Brothers are out now.", "description": "Guitarist Robbie Robertson helped to change music history with Bob Dylan\u2019s backing group the Band.
