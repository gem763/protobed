Washington begins the regular season Sunday in Philadelphia and as of now, plans to start veteran Donald Penn in Williams\u2018 spot.\n\n\u201cI have no expectations whatsoever anymore,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of numb to the facts. We\u2019re just going to coach the guys that we have. That\u2019s all we can do right now.\u201d\n\nTeam president Bruce Allen told NBC4 last week he still expects Williams to play for the Redskins this season, but did not indicate when. On The Athletic\u2019s Redskins\u2018 podcast, \u201cHail to the Podcast,\u201d former cornerback DeAngelo Hall relayed a conversation with Williams that emphasized that Williams won\u2019t be showing up for Week 1.\n\n\u201cI hear some whispers that he might show up,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAnd then I talked to him and it\u2019s like, \u2018Nah, I\u2019m not showing up. We haven\u2019t talked, we haven\u2019t addressed the issues.\u2019 It\u2019s kind of like, at what point do you as the Washington Redskins organization say, \u2018Hey look, we gotta get something for this guy?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Redskins have insisted they will not be trading Williams, while the 31-year-old reportedly has vowed to never play with Washington again. So far, there appears to be no resolution in sight.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
