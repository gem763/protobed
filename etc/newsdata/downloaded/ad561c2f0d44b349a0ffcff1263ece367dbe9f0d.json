In April 2019, the FBI said losses caused by BEC (Business Email Compromise) scams doubled in 2018, compared to 2017 figures, and reached a whopping $1.3 billion, based on victim reports received by the agency's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).\n\nAIG blamed the recent rise in BEC-related cyber-insurance claims on the poor security measures victim companies had in place, such as the use of poor passwords for email accounts, companies not using multi-factor authentication, or the lack of employee training in regards to email-based attacks.\n\nRansomware-related claims expected to grow\n\nBut despite BEC ranking first, AIG expects that ransomware may soon reclaim its top spot, which it held in the previous year, in 2017, when ransomware-related claims accounted for 26% of all cyber-insurance claims.\n\nThe number of ransomware-related cyber-insurance claims dropped in 2018 because ransomware attacks, in general, became more targeted.\n\nNowadays, ransomware gangs tend to go after companies and government organizations, rather than home consumers. The incidents are fewer, but the payouts for criminal gangs are larger.\n\nBut despite the smaller number of ransomware infections, AIG believes the number of cyber-insurance claims will go up, as enterprise and government victims learn that they can offset losses by filing a cyber-insurance claim.\n\nA trend like this has already become widespread in the US. A recent ProPublica investigation discovered that insurance companies are now advising victims to pay the ransom demand and then file a cyber-insurance claim. This recent tactic, seen predominantly in the US, is a win-win strategy where the victim regains access to its files and the cyber-insurer gets away with covering a smaller claim for the ransom demand, rather than a bigger one for rebuilding a victim's entire IT network.\n\nClaims frequency and the GDPR\n\nBut the most interesting trend from the AIG report in regards to cyber-insurance claims filed in 2018 in the EMEA region is one that's related to the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nAIG noted a pronounced \"GDPR effect,\" meaning that companies started filing more cyber-insurance claims after the GDPR came into effect in late May 2018.\n\nThe reason may be that companies can't hide data breaches anymore, facing steep GDPR penalties, so they choose to go public and file a cyber-insurance claim to cover some of their costs and the impending GDPR fine.\n\nAIG said that around a fifth of all cyber-insurance claims it received in 2018 in the EMEA region also included a public GDPR notification. Those insurance claims, AIG noted, included costs significantly higher in comparison to claims that didn't result in a GDPR data breach notification.", "description": "BEC-relatedcyber-insurance claims accounted for nearly a quarter of all claims in the EMEA region, AIG said.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/22/190eca2b-1c1e-46eb-97ae-82f83154414a/thumbnail/770x578/623ad7c0bf4b274afc7726788f255686/money.jpg"}
