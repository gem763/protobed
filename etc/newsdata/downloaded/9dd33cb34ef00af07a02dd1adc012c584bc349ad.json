Tedo Abzhandadze converted to make it 12-0.\n\nUruguay then took advantage of a lapse in the lineout defense from the Georgians, allowing center Andres Vilaseca to cross after a getting an inside ball from a strong running Rodrigo Silva.\n\nFelipe Berchesi converted and had a chance to close the gap further but missed a penalty attempt late in the half and Georgia led 12-7 at the break.\n\nFurther underscoring Georgia's advantage in the pack, prop Levan Chilachava barged over three minutes after halftime to complete a simple move down the short side.\n\nBregvadze also scored from close range, then livened up the crowd with his chip kick that resulted in points, but may not get the blessing of his coach.
