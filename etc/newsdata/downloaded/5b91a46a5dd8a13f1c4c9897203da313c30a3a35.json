A freakin\u2019 screwdriver.\u201d\n\nUse Grapefruit-Flavoured Soft Drink To Make A Perfect Paloma A Paloma is one of my favourite \u201csomething and soft drinks,\u201d mainly because it\u2019s a good excuse to drink some grapefruit soft drink, the drink of my childhood. Combine it with tequila, and a little lime, and you have a very sunny, sippable cocktail you can build right in the glass.

We can add a little flair, a little dimension and a little more booze.\n\nPierre Ferrand Dry Cura\u00e7ao is a brandy-based, orange peel-infused liqueur that is more rich and complex than most citrus liqueurs, and \u2014 when mixed with fresh orange juice and vodka \u2014 it provides more orange flavour, but it\u2019s a more sophisticated, well-rounded orange flavour.\n\nWhen shook, it takes on a fluffy, creamsicle quality, but the acidic juice keeps thing from getting too sweet and syrupy. In short, it is very good. To make it, you will need:\n\n60ml vodka\n\n15ml Pierre Ferrand Dry Cura\u00e7ao\n\n90ml orange juice (freshly squeezed if possible)\n\nCombine everything in a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake vigorously until the tin becomes too cold to hold comfortably. Strain into a lowball with more ice, and enjoy.", "description": "The screwdriver is not a bad drink, but it isn\u2019t a great drink.
