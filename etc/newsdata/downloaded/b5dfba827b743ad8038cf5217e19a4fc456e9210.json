In 2017 and 2018 she finished the Chicago Marathon in 2:20:22 and 2:18:35, respectively, after logging a year-end best time of 2:24:45 at Lisbon in 2016.\n\nThe 25-year-old arrived in the Windy City as an overwhelming favourite, having won the race in 2018.\n\nLast month she clinched the unofficial best women\u2019s half marathon time of 1:04:28 at the Great North Run and earlier this year she became the youngest woman to ever win the London Marathon.\n\nHer confidence showed at the start of the race, when she set an aggressive pace of 3:05.59 minutes per kilometre in the first 5km, causing commentators to fret that she had perhaps overextended herself.\n\n\u201cI was too fast because I wanted to leave the group and focus,\u201d said Kosgei. \u201cI come here to run my own pace, I don\u2019t depend on someone.\u201d", "description": "Like any true competitor, Kenya's Brigid Kosgei does not plan to coast on her latest accomplishment -- even if that happens to be running the fastest-ever women's marathon.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440464306&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0MI", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
