In addition, some charges beyond his manslaughter conviction have been reduced to misdemeanors, the station reported.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, according to Jackie\u2019s family: Rainwater will likely be living in Tracy, the same Northern California city that Jackie\u2019s family members call home.\n\nThe family hopes authorities will force Rainwater to live somewhere else, Cruser said.\n\n\u201cFar away, far away,\u201d she told FOX 40. \u201cBecause no one wants to run into him at a grocery store or a gas station.\u201d\n\nRetired detective Dale Jaynes said he\u2019ll never forget the crime scene after Jackie\u2019s death in her Livermore apartment.\n\n\u201cThe amount of blood that was in that kitchen, you had to watch where you walked, not only because the evidence but just \u2026 slipping,\u201d Jaynes told FOX 40. \u201cIt was one of the most gruesome scenes I\u2019ve been in.
