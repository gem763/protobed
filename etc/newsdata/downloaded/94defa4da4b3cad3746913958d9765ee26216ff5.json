But the deal does not address autos, a key sticking point during months of contentious negotiations, and President Donald Trump indicated the two countries were still working on a broader agreement.\n\nThe trade agreement helped set a positive tone for stocks in Asia Thursday, with Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei NIK, +0.28% and Hong Kong\u2019 Hang Seng HSI, +0.19% indexes leading the way with 0.5% gains. Chinese stocks SHCOMP, -0.73% 399106, -2.31% were also higher, up about 0.4%.\n\nTrump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed the trade deal on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Trump called it the \u201cfirst stage of a phenomenal new trade agreement\u201d and described it as \u201coutlining the significant steps we\u2019re taking toward a fair and reciprocal trade agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a big chunk, but in the fairly near future we\u2019re going to be having a lot more comprehensive deals signed with Japan,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAbe said the agreement is good for both countries.\n\n\u201cWe have successfully covered a wide range of areas, including not only the industrial goods, but also the agricultural products and also the digital trade between the two sides,\u201d Abe said.\n\nTrump has been seeking a bilateral agreement with Japan, the world\u2019s third largest economy, since pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal after he took office. Washington would like to reduce a chronic trade imbalance that totaled $67.6 billion in 2018, according to U.S. figures.\n\nThe two sides reached a basic agreement in late August, but a major point of contention has been autos.\n\nJapan is worried that Trump might slap new tariffs on its automobiles, which make up a significant amount of its exports to the U.S. Japan also has pushed to eliminate the current 2.5% auto and auto parts tariff.\n\nSpeaking to reporters later Wednesday, Abe said he received assurances from Trump that a previous agreement not to place more tariffs on Japanese autos or auto parts still stands.\n\n\u201cBetween President Trump and myself, this has been firmly confirmed that no further additional tariffs will be imposed,\u201d Abe said.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s largest company Fonterra once had grand ambitions to dominate the world\u2019s dairy markets, but after suffering stinging losses to the value of its businesses abroad has scaled back its vision.\n\nFonterra FCG, +6.21% on Thursday announced its worst-ever annual result as it wrote down the value of its assets by hundreds of millions of dollars and promised to stay more focused on its roots on New Zealand dairy farms.\n\nThe company announced an after-tax loss of 605 million New Zealand dollars ($380 million) for the year ended July, compared to a loss of NZ$196 million the previous year. The loss included write-downs of NZ$826 million.\n\nOwned cooperatively by 10,000 farmers, the company is the most important to New Zealand\u2019s economy and is responsible for some 25% of New Zealand\u2019s exports. New Zealand stocks NZ50GR, -0.25% were moving slightly higher early Thursday, up just under 0.1%.\n\nChina\u2019s pork-price gains have slowed amid early signs of recovery in pig farming ahead of the coming National Day holiday, an official said.\n\nWeekly increases in pork prices have been moderating, with prices up 8.6%, 6.3%, 3.4% and 1.6%, respectively, during the previous four weeks ended Sept. 20, said Yang Zhenhai, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, in a statement posted on the central government\u2019s website on Wednesday.\n\nIn recent weeks, authorities have rolled out a series of measures to ease a supply shortage due to an outbreak of African swine fever, including farming incentives, opening its emergency pork reserves and increasing pork imports.\n\nThe story was compiled from Dow Jones Newswires and Associated Press reports.", "description": "A trade agreement between the U.S. and Japan helped set a positive tone for stocks in Asia Thursday, with Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei and Hong Kong\u2019 Hang Seng indexes...", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS083_trump__ZG_20190925212706.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
