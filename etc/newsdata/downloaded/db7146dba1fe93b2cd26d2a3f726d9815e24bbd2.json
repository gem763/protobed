The app lets up to six people video chat at the same time, but with a twist: Cabana isn\u2019t about just getting together to talk, it\u2019s about getting together to watch YouTube videos.\n\nAfter joining a Cabana chat, anyone in the room will be able to browse through YouTube and select a video. It\u2019ll start playing for everyone in the room, and the idea is that you\u2019ll all be able to watch it together, enjoying each others\u2019 silence or chatting over the entire thing.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw [the app for the first time], I said, \u2018Shit, I can't believe you actually can't do this yet,\u2019\u201d says Tumblr founder and CEO David Karp. \u201cYeah, you can hang out with your buddies in a group chat, yeah you can send somebody a link to a video. But that experience of getting to sit there there and watch [a video] with them as they watch it for the first time, that just didn't exist yet.\u201d\n\nKarp\u2019s hope is that people will use Cabana to introduce their friends to \u201cthat ridiculous or amazing or totally insightful incredible video\u201d they\u2019ve just found. It\u2019s supposed to replicate that experience of being in a room together, pulling up a favorite YouTube video, and watching everyone\u2019s reaction before starting on another.\n\nCabana isn\u2019t connected to Tumblr at all \u2014 it\u2019s a new social graph\n\nCabana is a particularly interesting bet for Tumblr because it\u2019s so unlike Tumblr itself. Where Tumblr is organized around strangers with shared interests, Cabana is all about bringing together close friends who actually know each other. At launch, Cabana isn\u2019t even linked to Tumblr \u2014 you\u2019ll have to find your friends all over again by looking up their phone numbers.\n\nThe app offers Tumblr an opportunity to expand its reach by connecting people in a very different way than it does today. That may be an important goal for the company: the research firm eMarketer pegs Tumblr\u2019s US users at around 23 million \u2014 a third as many as Instagram, which launched three years later. The firm believes Tumblr\u2019s user growth is slowing, which isn\u2019t a great sign for a once explosive network.\n\nFor the most part, Karp says this isn\u2019t what Tumblr is after with Cabana. \u201cI mean sure, we're always looking at everything we launch as an opportunity to reach more people, be meaningful to more people,\u201d he says. But Karp adds that the company\u2019s focus remains on Tumblr, suggesting we won\u2019t see more and more standalone apps. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it's part of a bigger strategic direction or push,\u201d he says of Cabana.\n\nThough Tumblr is launching this app and has been involved in its development, Cabana didn\u2019t originate inside the company. The app started in a Yahoo incubator and caught Karp\u2019s interest after he saw a demo. Then in the past couple months, it was brought under Tumblr\u2019s umbrella. Karp wouldn\u2019t say whether Cabana and Tumblr would integrate at any point.\n\nDevelopers have tried and failed at group video chatting countless times, but there\u2019s at least some reason to think Cabana may be on to something. For one, it has Tumblr\u2019s backing and will get plenty of promotion. And the app is also built with many of the same mechanics used by Houseparty, the group video chatting app launched by the company behind Meerkat, which has seen some early success.\n\nLike Houseparty, Cabana immediately launches users into their own broadcast, and it\u2019ll alert all their friends with a push notification. It\u2019s designed to let people easily jump in and out of chats, making video chatting a lot more casual than it\u2019s long been on the web. Houseparty hit a million users within a year, making it something of a surprise hit.\n\n\u201cThe blend of hanging out and watching in Cabana is actually super hard to accomplish.\u201d\n\nBut that also brings up another issue: what can Cabana do to stand out, if a YouTube integration is its only unique feature?\n\nJason Lee, the current head of Cabana, says not to count on the app\u2019s core twist being cloned right away. \u201cThe blend of hanging out and watching in Cabana is actually super hard to accomplish,\u201d he says. \u201cOne interesting thing we spent a lot of time on is making sure audio is balanced between in chat and hanging out.\u201d Lee also says the new features planned for Cabana should keep the app distinct from its competitors.\n\nFor now, it sounds like those features will all revolve around watching, rather than Cabana expanding into other areas, like games. The app only integrates with YouTube for now \u2014 using YouTube\u2019s open extensions; there\u2019s no partnership \u2014 and Lee wouldn\u2019t say what\u2019ll get added next. It\u2019s easy to imagine Netflix being the dream integration here, but it\u2019s not clear that a controlling service like Netflix would be interested or even able to make such a commitment.\n\nCabana launches on iOS today in the United States and will come to Android in a few weeks. Karp sees the app as something anyone can use, but Lee says he expects it to connect most with teenagers and young adults.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Cabana taps into a real social interaction that doesn\u2019t quite exist online. And while Tumblr isn\u2019t focusing on it, Cabana sounds like it\u2019d be good for listening to music with friends, too.\n\nBut as someone outside the target age range, I already know I\u2019m going to stay far away. Because as the webcomic XKCD illustrated years ago, this is what all parties turn into once someone opens up YouTube:", "description": "Tumblr is getting into video chatting today with a new app called Cabana.
