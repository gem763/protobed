Now he appears to be trying to override a core principle of democracy: that no one is above the law.\n\nFaced with an impeachment inquiry, Trump has openly defied the core constructs of the Constitution. He chafes at the idea of co-equal branches of government and rejects the House\u2019s right to investigate him.\n\nHe has deployed a convoluted logic in which he has declared that the courts can\u2019t investigate him because as president he cannot be charged with a crime but also that Congress cannot impeach him because its inquiry is politically illegitimate.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cheads he wins, tails you lose\u201d formulation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s anathema to his character and his life story to be checked and balanced by anything,\u201d said presidential historian Jon Meacham, a professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThe Constitution was formed to contain appetite. And we now have the president who is driven entirely by appetite.\u201d\n\nIn a scathing eight-page letter this week, the Republican president\u2019s lawyers served notice there will be no cooperation with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House has ignored document requests and subpoenas. It readily invokes executive privilege \u2014 going so far as to argue that the privilege extends to informal presidential advisers who never held White House jobs. And his team all but dares Democrats to hold them in contempt.\n\nThe impeachment standoff follows a pattern Trump has established throughout his presidency as he has jettisoned experienced advisers and flouted conventions.\n\nThe fact that he survived the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation without paying much of a political penalty left him all the more emboldened.\n\nOne day after Robert Mueller\u2019s faltering testimony brought an end to that threat, Trump unleashed a new one by asking Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political foe Joe Biden. That prompted the fast-moving impeachment inquiry that Trump now resists.\n\nAfter two weeks of a listless and unfocused response to the impeachment probe, the White House letter to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week was a declaration of war.\n\nWhile it was filled with dubious legal arguments, its intent was clear: Trump would not play ball, claiming that the game was rigged against him.\n\nAs for all the subpoenas flying from House Democrats, an exasperated Trump said Thursday, \u201cYou\u2019re running a country, I just don\u2019t think that you can have all of these people testifying about every conversation you\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nAnd as for the Democrats, Trump claimed Wednesday they\u2019re the ones playing dirty \u201cbecause they have a tiny margin in the House.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have eviscerated the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t give us any \u2014 any fair play. It\u2019s the most unfair situation people have seen.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution gives the House \u201cthe sole power of impeachment.\u201d But it confers that authority without providing any guidelines, which the White House has seized upon in demanding that Pelosi call for a vote to authorize the inquiry as happened in the last two impeachment inquiries.\n\nNo vote is required, and Trump\u2019s strategy risks further provoking Democrats in the impeachment probe, setting up court challenges and the potential for lawmakers to draw up an article of impeachment for obstructing their investigations.\n\n\u201cThe president does not have all-consuming power,\u201d said Nick Ackerman, a member of the Watergate prosecution team that investigated President Richard Nixon. \u201cWe play by certain rules, and we expect the rule of law to apply. We don\u2019t have checks and balances if he ignores them. That itself is an impeachable defense, which is what Nixon faced.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether Democrats would wade into a lengthy legal fight with the administration over documents and testimony or if they would just move straight to considering articles of impeachment.\n\nTrump, for his part, has never been one to rely on legality or logic in making his arguments.\n\nIn the last week alone, he called for the impeachment of Sen. Mitt Romney and Rep. Adam Schiff \u2014 events that can\u2019t occur \u2014 and in part justified his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, leaving the Kurds vulnerable to Turkish attacks, by saying the Kurds did not assist at Normandy during World War II.\n\nSince taking office, he has taken repeatedly taken unilateral action to defy Congress and push the limits of his own power, declaring a national emergency so he could divert funds for a border wall and taking executive action to try to halt immigration from several Muslim-majority nations.\n\nTrump on Thursday punctuated a tweet about unfair media coverage with four words that seemed to sum up his entire viewpoint of the American system: \u201cOh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d\n\nThe Constitution was built to withstand tests like this.\n\n\u201cBoth the strength of the American system and one of its most frustrating aspects is that it\u2019s incredibly difficult to do anything quickly, particularly bad things, which the founders believed would happen more often than good things,\u201d Meacham said. \u201cChecks and balances were created so one bad actor could not dominate the proceedings. We now have that bad actor.\u201d\n\n___\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 Jonathan Lemire has covered politics and the White House for The Associated Press since 2013.\n\n___\n\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire", "description": "Faced with an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump has openly defied the core constructs of the Constitution.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da06d22210000e706344375.jpeg?cache=9dnqahphuc&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
