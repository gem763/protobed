The couple, who married in 2004, couldn't wipe the smiles off their faces as they strolled through the terminal before heading home\n\nWhat a gentleman! Jessica held one of their daughters' hands while Nine News anchor Peter, 53, walked ahead of them and pushed along their luggage\n\nAccording to Jessica, she 'wasted' her twenties and thirties worrying about things and people that didn't really matter.\n\n'I look back and I realise in my twenties and thirties I wasted far too much energy invested in what people thought of me and also wasting energy on people who - really, when I think about it - I didn't really like very much,' she confessed.\n\nJessica added that she has since learned to 'embrace' herself for who she really is.\n\n'Now I'm 49 and I can say I'm the happiest I've ever been because I really embrace who I am, my sort of flaws, my vulnerabilities, my quirks, I realise that I'm not perfect,' she said.\n\nFeels good to be home!

All four were in high spirits, showing no sign of a post-holiday comedown\n\n'It is impossible to have the perfect life; it's impossible to be all things to everyone, and we have to let go of that myth of being Superwoman, that myth of being the perfect mum, the perfect wife, the perfect friend, the perfect career woman - there's no such thing.'\n\nJessica previously spoke about getting older in an interview with Whimn in September last year.\n\n'What I love about getting older is that I know I have got quirkier and more eccentric, which is very freeing, because I care less about what people think, and that is so lovely,' she said.\n\n'I'm the happiest I've ever been!' In an interview with New Idea on Monday, Jessica revealed she feels happier and more confident than ever before\n\nFinally free: According to Jessica, she 'wasted' her twenties and thirties worrying about things and people that didn't really matter\n\nDespite her newfound confidence, Jessica recently admitted she had a hard time being 'sexy' on The Real Dirty Dancing.\n\nIn an interview with The Morning Show last month, she confessed to feeling insecure going into the show.\n\n'I found it very confronting, and I didn't expect that would happen... So for me to shed my inhibitions and shed my gear was hard,' she said.", "description": "Jessica Rowe and Peter Overton landed in Sydney Airport on Tuesday after a family holiday in Hawaii with their daughters Allegra, 12, and Giselle, 10.", "authors": ["Joshua Fox", "Demeter Stamell For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/23/19514784-0-image-a-23_1570659967733.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
