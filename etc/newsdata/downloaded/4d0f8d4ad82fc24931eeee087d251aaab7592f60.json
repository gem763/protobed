Still, polling has yet to show signs of a significant Green \u201cwave\u201d building in Canada.\n\nC\u2019EST LUNDI \u2014 Welcome to POLITICO Pro Canada\u2019s morning newsletter, where we see Prime Minister Justin Trudeau getting a double-whammy in this side-eye piece in satirical site The Onion.\n\nSend news tips and song requests to lgardner@politico.com, apanetta@politico.com and cboudreau@politico.com, or on Twitter @Gardner_LM, @Alex_Panetta and @ceboudreau.\n\n\u201cYou want to get messed up? / When the times get rough / Put your favorite record on baby / And fill the bathtub up\u201d\n\nTHE GREAT DEBATE \u2014 It\u2019s debate night in Ottawa (well, technically in Gatineau, but your hosts digress), where six party leaders will each make their case to the English-speaking electorate, all on one stage. If any of them is going to break out from the pack, tonight could prove pivotal.\n\n\u2014 Where things stand: The race remains deadlocked between the Liberals and the Conservatives, according to an aggregate of national polls, Lauren writes.\n\nThere has been some movement, however. The Bloc Quebecois pushed ahead of the Tories in Quebec after last week\u2019s French-language debate, a development that could spell trouble for Conservatives, who need pickups in the province to stand a chance at forming government.\n\n\u2014 Get instant analysis: Your Pro Canada team will be following tonight\u2019s debate live alongside POLITICO\u2019s Ryan Heath, who will be on the ground in Ottawa.

That\u2019s what happened in Quebec in 1984, 1993, 2011 and 2015. Each time, a different party went from nowhere to taking between two-thirds and three-quarters of the seats.\n\n\u2014 Liberals watching nervously: Trudeau can only afford to lose eight seats to retain his parliamentary majority, and he\u2019d be defeated entirely if he loses too many more. Quebec happens to be the one populous region where the Liberals might not only hold onto huge numbers, but potentially even make gains. \u201cIt comes down to math,\u201d one Liberal official said, speaking of Quebec. \u201cAnd the fruit is ripe there.\u201d\n\n\u2014 It\u2019s a bit easier being Green: May has largely bounced between the Greens\u2019 stronghold in Vancouver and Vancouver Island and Atlantic Canada during the campaign, stumping for votes in areas where strong provincial showings by the party could yield federal seats later this month.\n\nAlthough polling isn\u2019t predicting a wave, May is banking on voter disenchantment with the establishment parties \u2014 and growing concern about the effects of climate change \u2014 to move more votes into her party\u2019s column on Oct. 21, Lauren writes.\n\n\u2014 Growth opportunity: Her party is expected to increase its representation up from 2 currently in the House of Commons. That could help it play kingmaker of sorts after election day, depending on how the balance of power shakes out.\n\nMay wouldn\u2019t commit to how the Greens would or wouldn\u2019t work with the other parties to form government, except to say the party wouldn\u2019t abandon its commitment to meeting certain stringent carbon reduction benchmarks.\n\n\u201cThere is no inevitability about who leads a political party into the next Parliament,\u201d May told Lauren last month, just minutes after Trudeau made his first statement apologizing for photos showing him wearing brownface.\n\nPRUDENT TECHNOPHILES \u2014 An exclusive POLITICO/Abacus Data poll casts Canadians as prudent technophiles. About 45 percent strongly or somewhat support the development of Artificial Intelligence tools, while 29 percent strongly or somewhat oppose AI's development. Only 18 percent of Canadians fear losing a job to A.I.\n\nAbacus Data CEO David Coletto said this gives policy-makers some leash to develop these tools, but warns global opinion can shift quickly, as it did with social media giants and privacy issues.\n\n\u2014 Huawei factor: The survey says 36 percent of Canadians believe Chinese telecom firm Huawei should not be allowed to participate in developing the country's 5G network, 25 percent say it should be allowed, and 39 percent don't have clear views.\n\nColetto says the ambiguous state of public opinion make a tough decision on Huawei even tougher for the Canadian government. The Trudeau government has delayed a 5G decision until after the election. The Conservatives say they\u2019d ban Huawei from the network.\n\n\u201cCanada is being put between two superpowers and being forced to decide [between angering the U.S. or China],\u201d Coletto said. \u201cAnd the public is not making it any easier for them.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The New York Times profiled Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer over the weekend, leading with a sore subject for some in American politics: crowd size.\n\n\u2014 A Conservative Party spokesperson confirmed Scheer is registered with the U.S. Selective Service, the agency that runs the American military draft. The revelation comes amid the news that the Conservative leader has dual Canadian and U.S. citizenship. CBC News.\n\n\u2014 The Trudeau government is appealing a ruling from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to pay C$2 billion to Indigenous children and their families in compensation for forced removals and a chronically underfunded child welfare system. The Indigenous Services minister said he was hoping for a stay of the ruling to consider next steps outside of an election season. Canadian Press.\n\n\u2014 Former NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair said current Leader Jagmeet Singh has \u201ctotally abandoned\u201d party principles by supporting Quebec\u2019s ability to enact the controversial religious symbols legislation Bill 21. Mulcair suffered in the 2015 election by standing up for Muslim women\u2019s right to wear a niqab. CTV News.\n\n\u2014 Singh slammed the Green Party and refused demands to apologize after stating the party\u2019s candidates did not have a clear position on abortion rights. NDP candidates have raised stances on abortion in an attempt to provide contrasts with Green positions in competitive ridings. Canadian Press.\n\n\u2014 The president and CEO of a publicly traded tech firm writes a first-person account of how government programs like an initiative to nurture A.I. funding and good immigration policies helped persuade his company to move from Silicon Valley to Canada.
