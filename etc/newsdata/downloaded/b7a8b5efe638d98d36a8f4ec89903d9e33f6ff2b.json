And it\u2019s all thanks to Google Maps, strangely enough.\n\nBarry Fay, a 50-year-old resident of Wellington, Florida, called the police after a neighbour told him that there was a car in the pond behind his house that could be seen from Google Maps. Fay didn\u2019t believe his neighbour at first, but he enlisted a friend with a hobby drone to hover over the pond and see for himself. Sure enough, there was a car in there, and police officers came to pull out the white 1994 Saturn SL with Moldt\u2019s skeleton inside.\n\n\u201cI called the former owner of my house and asked if she knew about this,\u201d Fay told the Sun Sentinel. \u201cShe was shocked.\u201d\n\nThe skeleton was found at the 3700 block of Moon Bay Circle in Wellington, Florida, part of a housing development called the Grand Isles. The gated community had been under construction at the time of Moldt\u2019s disappearance in 1997, according to the Charley Project, a cold case investigation community.\n\n\u201cUpon arrival deputies confirmed there was a vehicle in the pond,\u201d the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement posted to Facebook. \u201cThe vehicle\u2019s exterior was heavily calcified and was obviously in the water for a significant amount of time. Upon removing the vehicle, skeleton remains were found inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn September 10, 2019, the remains were positively identified as William Moldt, who was reported missing on November 8, 1997.\u201d\n\nAs the Charley Project notes, the car has been visible on Google Earth since at least 2007, thanks to the company\u2019s satellite mapping software.\n\nInvestigators still have no idea what happened to Moldt, who went missing after visiting a nightclub 22 years ago. Moldt had called his girlfriend around 9:30pm to tell her that he was on his way home but was never heard from again. Some speculate that he may have had too much to drink, but he wasn\u2019t known as a heavy drinker.\n\nApparently, a lot of cars are sitting in America\u2019s lakes, ponds, and canals, especially in Florida. Authorities discovered six cars in the Boca Rio canal one day in 2017 after they lowered the water level in preparation for a hurricane. One of the vehicles, a Toyota RAV4, contained the remains of a 47-year-old woman named Loraine Pino who had disappeared the year before.\n\nThe public may never learn what actually happened to Moldt if the authorities on the ground are to be believed.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t determine what happened that many years ago, what transpired,\u201d a police spokesperson from the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office told the BBC. \u201cAll we know is that he went missing off the face of the Earth, and now he\u2019s been discovered.\u201d", "description": "The body of William Moldt, a 40-year-old Florida man who was reported missing in November of 1997, has been found.
