Many are frustrated with the company\u2019s decision to remove a pro-Hong Kong protester mobile game, The Revolution of Our Times, from the Google Play store and feel the company should have handled the situation differently.\n\nThe issue was important enough to be addressed by leadership at the company\u2019s most recent all-hands \u201cTGIF\u201d meeting, according to several sources. And the discussions have stoked tensions between employees who support the Hong Kong protesters and believe that tech companies like Google have an ethical imperative to support democratic movements, and some pro-Chinese government employees who say that such discussions are inappropriate on internal listservs.\n\nThe Hong Kong debate comes only a few months after Google specifically told employees it was changing the rules of its office culture and that workers need to spend less of their time engaging in political debates at work.\n\nIn the past few days, employees have been posting a torrent of messages in support of Hong Kong protesters on Memegen, a popular employee-run internal message board where colleagues regularly comment on current events and company policies. Since last week, dozens of memes about the Hong Kong protests have racked up thousands of upvotes, a mark of approval similar to a \u201cLike,\u201d from colleagues, according to posts reviewed by Recode.\n\nOne popular meme with hundreds of upvotes features a picture of protesters crowding a square in Hong Kong, with the words \u201c#FightforFreedom #StandwithHongKong\u201d up top and \u201cKeep going!\u201d at the bottom.\n\nHave more information about Google or tech worker activism?

Google pulled the game, saying it violated a Play Store policy that bans monetization of \u201csensitive events.\u201d The employee said Google could have reached out to the developer about monetization concerns rather than \u201csimply banning\u201d the game, which they said donated most of its proceeds to charity.\n\n\u201cWe have a long-standing policy prohibiting developers from capitalizing on sensitive events such as attempting to make money from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game. After careful review, we found this app to be violating that particular policy and suspended it, as we have done with similar attempts to profit from other high-profile events such as earthquakes, crises, suicides, and conflicts,\u201d a Google spokesperson wrote in a statement to Recode.\n\nGoogle is just one of several tech companies that have made controversial decisions related to the protests in Hong Kong. Last week, video game company Blizzard banned a prominent player who voiced support for the Hong Kong protests. (Blizzard reinstated the player\u2019s prize money and reduced his suspension time following public outcry and a dozen employees walking out of work over the issue.). Apple also recently pulled a pro-Hong Kong protester map tool from its App Store, citing concerns that it could enable attacks on Chinese police.\n\nMeanwhile, some Google employees who seem to disagree with the Hong Kong protesters\u2019 cause have tried to shut down their colleagues\u2019 discussions about Hong Kong, characterizing them as irrelevant to the workplace, uninformed, and offensive. These comments, also reviewed by Recode, use a common line of reasoning from the Chinese government and its supporters: that the issue in Hong Kong is more complicated than Westerners portray it to be and that protesters who fill the streets do not represent a consensus of Hong Kong residents (the Chinese government itself, though, has been accused of spreading disinformation about the protests).\n\nFrom a business standpoint, the actions of companies like Google, Apple, and Blizzard seem as though they\u2019re meant to appease the Chinese government \u2014 which makes sense. As Recode\u2019s Peter Kafka has written, upsetting China\u2019s leadership would undoubtedly impact Apple\u2019s ability to do business in the country. That\u2019s a risk that companies like Apple can\u2019t afford. The iPhone maker is a rare US tech giant that\u2019s doing well in the country, which represents its third-largest market with over $44 billion in annual sales. Meanwhile, other tech companies are still trying to crack the Chinese market, like Google\u2019s highly controversial attempt to build a censored search product for the country (which the company has since said it has canceled).\n\nBut from a political standpoint, tech companies\u2019 seeming willingness to placate China is attracting scrutiny from the public and politicians on both sides of the aisle, who have rebuked companies for putting foreign profits over protecting protesters\u2019 freedom of speech in the China-Hong Kong debate.\n\nAnd now, as these internal Google discussions prove, tech companies are facing dissent from within their own ranks.\n\n\u201cGoogle used to be a company that adamantly supported democracy, but will it abandon Hong Kong?\u201d one employee, who asked to remain anonymous, told Recode. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Larry and Sundar to take a stand.\u201d\n\nFreedom of speech versus cultural sensitivities\n\nWhile most employees who have posted on Google\u2019s internal message boards vehemently support Hong Kong protesters, a minority of employee commenters have defended the Chinese government.\n\nIn one email on the popular listserv Industryinfo, where Googlers regularly post links to tech headlines, one employee posted a link to a news article about how Google removed The Revolution of Our Times.\n\nThe first employee to reply to the thread immediately questioned the post\u2019s legitimacy, arguing that the article didn\u2019t belong in the listserv. The employee argued that if the poster had an issue with Google\u2019s decision to remove the pro-Hong Kong protester game from the Play store, they should file a private complaint with the team working on it instead of sharing a news article.\n\n\u201cI would say it is not a IndustryInfo news,\u201d wrote the commenter. \u201cYou\u2019d do better to file a bug to Google Play team if you think content is not sensitive; however, I personally believe it is sensitive.\u201d\n\nAnother employee fired back, defending the post\u2019s relevance to the mailing list.\n\n\u201cA major industry player \u2014 such as Google \u2014 censoring content is absolutely *information* about the *industry,*\u201d the employee wrote.\n\nAnother employee on the thread questioned whether Google\u2019s decision to pull the app was akin to a country pulling a Nazi app in a country where it\u2019s illegal to post such content \u2014 an idea that was critiqued by another commenter who asked, \u201cDid I miss the part where pro-HK apps became illegal in the US?\u201d\n\nFor many Google employees defending free speech, China is an especially sensitive subject, given Google\u2019s controversial Project Dragonfly, which was a secretive attempt to develop a custom version of its search engine for China that would blacklist phrases like \u201cfree speech.\u201d After the project became public, the company faced internal and external pressure not to build a search product on such terms, and Google eventually said it\u2019s halting its efforts.\n\nHistorically, Google has allowed and even encouraged debate on political issues like Project Dragonfly, no matter how big or small. Back in 2008, Google had a huge debate over a \u201cFree Tibet\u201d-themed pie that a company chef served in the corporate cafeteria. The chef was suspended but later reinstated as debate about the incident spurned a then-record-setting 1,000 internal emails in a single day.\n\nBut as Google has grown into a bigger company and attracted intense political scrutiny, it\u2019s started cracking down on its rules around speech. In August, the company updated its policies, banning employees from discussing politics at work unless it was relevant to the company\u2019s policies or working conditions.\n\n\u201cWhile sharing information and ideas with colleagues helps build community, disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics or the latest news story does not,\u201d the guidelines state, while at the same time saying that employees are \u201cfree to raise concerns and respectfully question and debate the company\u2019s activities,\u201d as it\u2019s \u201cpart of [Google\u2019s] culture\u201d to do so.\n\nClearly, these new rules aren\u2019t enough to deter Googlers from debating the protests. Overall, back-and-forth at Google around the Hong Kong protests represents a broader geopolitical battle that\u2019s now being debated among the workforce of US tech companies. It\u2019s a fascinating look at how divisive the industry\u2019s policy decisions in China are. And it raises questions about whether companies like Google and Apple are more accurately described as US firms or as nation-states that seek to balance the global interests of their many constituents \u2014 both American and, increasingly, Chinese.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated how Blizzard updated its punishment for a prominent video game player over his comments about Hong Kong. After public outcry, Blizzard reduced the player\u2019s suspension by six months and reinstated his prize money.", "description": "The company\u2019s move has helped spark a fiery debate playing out on the search giant\u2019s internal mailing lists.", "authors": ["Shirin Ghaffary", "Li Zhou", "Sean Collins", "Delia Paunescu", "Hannah Brown", "Dylan Scott", "Aaron Rupar", "Rani Molla", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H9Mx5ku9C-qMnpTRgWxQpfO37kg=/0x1104:8256x5427/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19289696/1175971649.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
