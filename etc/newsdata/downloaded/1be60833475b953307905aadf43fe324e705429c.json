They will likely stay on the picket lines for at least two more days as two union committees vote on the deal, after which the members will have to approve.\n\nTerms of the tentative four-year contract were not released, but it\u2019s likely to include some pay raises, lump sum payments to workers, and requirements that GM build new vehicles in U.S. factories. Early on, GM offered new products in Detroit and Lordstown, Ohio, two of the four U.S. cities where it planned to close factories.\n\nThe company offered to build a new electric pickup truck to keep the Detroit-Hamtramck plant open and to build an electric vehicle battery factory in or near Lordstown, Ohio, where GM is closing an assembly plant. The battery factory would employ far fewer workers and pay less money than the assembly plant.\n\nGM and the union have been negotiating at a time of troubling uncertainty for the U.S. auto industry. Driven up by the longest economic expansion in American history, auto sales appear to have peaked and are now heading in the other direction. GM and other carmakers are also struggling to make the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China and his tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have raised costs for auto companies. A revamped North American free trade deal is stalled in Congress, raising doubts about the future of America\u2019s trade in autos and auto parts with Canada and Mexico, which last year came to $257 billion.\n\nAmid that uncertainty, GM workers have wanted to lock in as much as they can before things get ugly. They argue that they had given up pay raises and made other concessions to keep GM afloat during its 2009 trip through bankruptcy protection. Now that GM has been nursed back to health \u2014 earning $2.42 billion in its latest quarter \u2014 they want a bigger share.\n\nIf approved, the contract agreement will set the pattern for negotiations at Fiat Chrysler and Ford. It wasn\u2019t clear which company the union would bargain with next, or whether there would be another strike.\n\nThe union\u2019s International Executive Board first has to vote on the GM deal, then union leaders from factories will travel to Detroit for a vote on Thursday. The earliest workers could return would be after that.\n\nIn past years, it\u2019s taken a minimum of three or four days and as long as several weeks for the national ratification vote. Workers took almost two weeks to finish voting on their last GM agreement, in October of 2015. Then, skilled trades workers rejected it, causing further delays.\n\nThis time around \u2014 with a federal corruption investigation that has implicated the past two UAW presidents and brought convictions of five union officials - many union members don\u2019t trust the leadership and likely won\u2019t want to return to work until they\u2019ve gotten a chance to vote on the deal themselves.\n\nIn August, the FBI raided the suburban Detroit home of UAW President Gary Jones. He has not been charged and has not commented on the raid. Earlier this month, Jones\u2019 successor as union regional director in Missouri was charged in a $600,000 embezzlement scheme, and another UAW official pleaded guilty to taking kickbacks from union vendors. Eight other people - including five UAW officials \u2014 have been convicted over the past two years of looting a jointly run Fiat Chrysler-UAW training center for blue-collar workers. Another official was charged in September.\n\nThere\u2019s also no guarantee that the first contract deal with GM will pass. Some workers on the picket lines said they may not vote for the first offer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just going to take the first thing that they give us,\u201d worker Tina Black said in September from the picket line at an engine and transmission plant in Romulus, Michigan, near Detroit\u2019s main airport.\n\nBut Louis Rocha, president of a UAW local in Orion Township, Michigan, said recently that union bargainers have taken strong positions against the company. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be OK,\u201d he said of the ratification vote.\n\nThe strike had shut down 33 GM manufacturing plants in nine states across the U.S. It was the first national strike by the union since a two-day walkout in 2007 that had little impact on the company.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bargainers for General Motors and the United Auto Workers reached a tentative contract deal on Wednesday that could end a monthlong strike that brought the company's U.S. factories to a standstill.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Krisher"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/gm_strike_03132_c0-127-3045-1903_s1200x700.jpg?f8af207e5f805129c9d5309895642ccbb18ffcb2", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
