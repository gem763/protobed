For answers, one must look at Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company which, until earlier this year, employed Hunter Biden.\n\nIn April 2014, Hunter Biden agreed to join Burisma\u2019s board of directors, ostensibly to advise on legal issues, The New Yorker reported. Biden had no known expertise on the natural gas industry, but Burisma was certainly in need of help.\n\nEarlier that month, British officials had frozen the London bank accounts of Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, and soon after, Ukrainian officials opened their own corruption investigation into Burisma, the Kyiv Post in Ukraine reported.\n\nHunter Biden helped to recruit a legal team for Burisma, including former Obama administration Justice Department official John Buretta and several American consulting firms, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe younger Biden was well compensated for his efforts. Records obtained by the Government Accountability Institute show he was paid as much as $83,333 per month for his work at Burisma.\n\nHunter Biden claims he had no role in the investigation of the company, and that he never spoke about it with his father \u2013 but the facts show a troubling overlap with the Obama administration\u2019s actions in Ukraine.\n\nOn April 16, 2014, White House records show that Devon Archer, Hunter Biden\u2019s business partner, made a private visit to the White House for a meeting with Vice President Biden. Five days later, on April 21, Joe Biden landed in Kiev for a series of high-level meetings with Ukrainian officials.\n\nSoon the United States and the International Monetary Fund would be pumping more than $1 billion into the Ukrainian economy, as I wrote in the New York Post.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe next day, there was a public announcement that Archer had been asked to join the board of Burisma. Three weeks after that, on May 13, it was officially announced that Hunter Biden would join, too. Like Hunter Biden, Archer had no background or experience in the energy sector.\n\nIn March 2016, Ukrainian officials fired Viktor Shokin, the controversial prosecutor general whose office was overseeing the investigation into Burisma, The New York Times reported.\n\nSix months later, the Burisma case was dropped entirely, the Kyiv Post reported.\n\nAccording to Joe Biden himself, the former vice president played a key role in the prosecutor\u2019s dismissal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn March 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans if Shokin was not fired, according to Biden, who recounted the exchange in a 2018 speech: \u201cI looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a b----. He got fired.\u201d\n\nWhile the propriety of Trump\u2019s call to the Ukrainian president is certainly questionable and worthy of inquiry, the investigation he was hoping for certainly seems warranted on its own merits.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PETER SCHWEIZER", "description": "There are plenty of questions about Joe Biden, his son and Ukraine that need to be answered.", "authors": ["Peter Schweizer", "Peter Schweizer Is The President Of The Government Accountability Institute", "The Author Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/20/694940094001_6088193642001_6088194459001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
