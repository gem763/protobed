But it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\u2019 Tom: \u2018And the answer is, would it be fair to say, not really OK, as in it\u2019s really been a struggle?\u2019 Meghan: \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\nJust a thought \u2014 but maybe the reason not many people have asked whether Meghan Markle is \u2018OK\u2019 is that most people think she has come pretty close to winning life\u2019s biggest lottery prize and that maybe Meghan Markle\u2019s problems, if they exist, are very much of the luxury variety.\n\nOnce just a third tier starlet known for a minor role in a fading US TV series, she is now married to one of the world\u2019s most eligible men, a royal prince no less, worth about \u00a340 million. None of this has to be spent on rent because the happy couple get a grace and favour five-bedroom \u2018cottage\u2019 free by the Queen, which was recently refurbished at taxpayers\u2019 expense to the tune of about \u00a33 million.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Hard\u2019: Meghan Markle Laments the Pressures of Royal Life https://t.co/DRk6LCAeaQ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 21, 2019\n\nPlus she gets the kick \u2014 denied to even the most famous actresses in the whole of Hollywood \u2014 of knowing that her baby boy, Archie, is now seventh in line to the British throne.\n\nOn top of that there are perks like the private jet flights to stay with celebrity friends like Sir Elton John and Serena Williams, who threw a \u00a3300,000 baby shower party for Meghan in New York.\n\nPlus front row seats at Wimbledon, which she would never access if she were just a common-or-garden US TV actress.\n\nPlus, of course, all the free publicity she could possibly desire, including a recent stint editing British Vogue magazine \u2013 which again, she would never have been asked to do in a million years if she were just the pretty, dark-haired, approaching-middle-age actress who was in that series \u2013 what was its name again? \u2013 about a wacky lawyer with an eidetic memory\u2026\n\nSo what, exactly, is the woman\u2019s problem?\n\nWell, of course, as we know, money doesn\u2019t buy happiness.\n\nPrince Harry, Meghan Markle Flying (Again) to Africa with Climate Message https://t.co/prMEmC9xdH \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 22, 2019\n\nWhat it does buy though, surely, is freedom from the stuff the less privileged among us have to worry about: freedom from having to do a day\u2019s work ever again; freedom to be able to jet off to a private island anywhere in the world and to stay there as long as she likes, unencumbered by attention from the media she has now apparently decided she finds too intrusive to bear.\n\nIf I were her lavishly paid PR consultant this is exactly what I would be advising Meghan to do right now. Her popularity is tanking, she\u2019s probably the second most bitterly divisive issue in Britain after Brexit, and if she carries on the way she\u2019s going she could well finish off the job started in the 1930s by her fellow unsuitable American spouse Wallace Simpson and kill Britain\u2019s Royal Family altogether.\n\nYes, I appreciate many American readers would consider this no bad thing.\n\nBut here in Britain, on the whole, we love our Royal Family. Or, rather, we at least love our Queen and the way she has steadfastly and with great dignity and gentle good humour held our country together through thick and thin for nearly 70 years.\n\nOne thing we love about our Queen is that she represents all of us. Because she keeps her mouth resolutely shut on contentious issues \u2013 she\u2019s much happier talking about horses, about which she knows a lot \u2013 she has stayed above the fray of politics.\n\nPrincess Pushy, on the other hand, has charged into the most divisive issues of the day like a bull into a china shop \u2013 especially regarding anything to do with identity politics.\n\nShe has, for example, spoken out publicly in favour of \u2018decolonising the curriculum\u2019 at universities: woke speak for \u2018removing any remaining intellectual content from dumbed-down academe, replacing the pursuit of excellence with the usual rag bag of feminist and race-baiting grievances.\u2019\n\nAlso her relentless quest for the cutting edge of woke has led her into some unforced errors which a better-advised royal would have avoided like the plague: promoting a charity cookbook raising funds for a notorious mosque with links to several terrorists; wading into the fraught sexual identity debate by apparently contemplating raising Archie in a \u2018gender neutral\u2019 manner; persuading her husband Harry that there\u2019s a thing called \u2018unconscious bias\u2019 which secretly turns all white people into racists\u2026\n\nBritain is not a racist country. Indeed, I think I speak for most of us when I say that we didn\u2019t even know Meghan Markle was a \u2018person of colour\u2019 \u2014 she could easily pass for Hispanic or southern Italian \u2014 until the media kept banging on about it and turned her mixed-race background into such a defining issue.\n\nIn doing so, Markle has engendered an aura of racial tension about the Royal Family where none hitherto existed. The Queen, as head of the Commonwealth, is well travelled and obviously comfortable with (and loved by) people of all races and colours and creeds. Now some jumped up U.S. TV actress has appeared on the scene and is acting like she\u2019s the first vaguely foreign person the Royal Family has ever met.\n\nWorse, she \u2014 and her unfortunate, emasculated husband \u2014 have developed the embarrassing habit of blaming all the criticism that Meghan gets on \u2018racism.\u2019\n\nThis is a message which has been eagerly seized on by her supporters, almost exclusively the kind of Social Justice Warriors who secretly hate the Royal Family and instinctively understand that Meghan is their best means of dismantling it from within. If you criticise Meghan in any way, the SJW mob will try to shut you down with the \u201cR\u201d word.\n\nBut it\u2019s not, of course, racism that has turned so many of us against Princess Pushy.\n\nWhat we object to is being lectured by some random actress who only arrived in the country about ten minutes ago, yet now feels that because she\u2019s married to Prince Charles\u2019s younger son it\u2019s her job to make us all think like politically correct Hollywood drones.\n\nIf Princess Pushy feels like she is being got at by Britain\u2019s tabloid media \u2014 traditionally the Royal Family\u2019s staunchest supporters \u2014 all she has to do is stop behaving like a Hollywood snowflake and start behaving like an actual British royal.", "description": "Princess Pushy -- aka former Suits actress Meghan Markle; aka the current Duchess of Sussex; aka Prince Harry's missus -- has been telling anyone who'll listen how tough it is being a member of Britain's Royal Family.", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176009693-e1571682206254-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
