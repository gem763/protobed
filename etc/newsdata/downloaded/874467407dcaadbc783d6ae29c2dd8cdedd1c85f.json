He also made clear that Turkey will not stop at a previously limited zone; he said Turkish control of the Syrian side of the border must extend all the way to the Iraqi border.\n\nCaught in the middle, the commander of Kurdish-led forces in Syria, Mazloum Abdi, told Kurdish TV, \"We will do whatever we can for the success of the ceasefire agreement.\" But one Kurdish official, Razan Hiddo, declared that Kurdish people would refuse to live under Turkish occupation.\n\nFighting continued in north-west Syria despite an agreement between Turkey and the US. AP\n\nMr Trump seemed to endorse the Turkish aim of ridding the Syrian side of the border of the Kurdish fighters. \"They had to have it cleaned out,\" he said.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Texas on Thursday night, Mr Trump said, \"Sometimes you have to let them fight, like two kids in a lot, you got to let them fight and then you pull them apart\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Mr Pence was speaking in Ankara, US troops were continuing to board aircraft leaving northern Syria. Officials said a couple of hundred had already departed, with hundreds more consolidated at a few bases waiting to move out.\n\nIn contrast with Mr Pence's description of a limited safe zone, the agreement would effectively create a zone of control patrolled by the Turkish military that Ankara wants to stretch for the entire border from the Euphrates River to the Iraqi border, though the agreement did not define the extent of the zone. Turkish forces currently control about a quarter of that length, captured in the past nine days.\n\nThe rest is held by the Kurdish-led forces or by the Syrian government military, backed by Russia, which the Kurds invited to move in to shield them from the Turks.\n\nAfter the Kurdish forces are cleared from the safe zone, Turkey has committed to a permanent ceasefire but is under no obligation to withdraw its troops. In addition, the deal gives Turkey relief from sanctions the US administration had imposed and threatened to increase, meaning there will be no penalty for the operation.\n\nAAP", "description": "The agreement requires the Kurds to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border in an arrangement that largely solidifies Turkey's position.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2157%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_94/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/342fdb8db547221cfbdf775d89118d83052e89df", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
