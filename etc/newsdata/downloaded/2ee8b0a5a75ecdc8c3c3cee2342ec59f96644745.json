(AP) - Thrillseekers from around the world are heading to southern West Virginia for an annual bridge-jumping event.\n\nSaturday\u2019s Bridge Day festival in Fayetteville is being held for the 40th year. It is the one day a year it\u2019s legal to jump off the 876-foot-high New River Gorge Bridge.\n\nHundreds of BASE jumpers make the leap by parachute off the bridge. BASE stands for the places from which jumpers usually leap: buildings, antennae, spans and earth.\n\nAt least 70,000 people are expected to walk across the bridge. Rappellers also will make their way from a cat walk under the bridge to the river below. Also available to anyone for $161 will be a 700-foot-long high line slide that drops 300 vertical feet.\n\nThe 3,030-foot-long bridge opened to traffic in October 1977.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Thrillseekers from around the world are heading to southern West Virginia for an annual bridge-jumping event.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
