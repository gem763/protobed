I don't f---ing know,\" James said, per ESPN. \u201cI don't know. I don't know. Ask Kawhi.\u201d\n\nJames believed Lakers had a chance to sign Leonard\n\nJames, who had a grin on his face when made that quip, did shed some light on his thoughts on Leonard during the recruitment process. He believed the Lakers had a chance to sign him.\n\n\u201cI don't get too excited until things actually happen, but I thought we had a chance,\" James said. \"That's all you can ask for. We put ourselves in position to have a chance to get [Leonard]. When he went to the Clippers, I thought that was just as cool. It was great for our league, and he had to do what was best for him. And we all respect that.\u201d\n\nLeBron James opened up on the recruitment process of Kawhi Leonard ahead of Tuesday's Lakers-Clippers game. (Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images)\n\nLeonard, of course, took his own time to make his decision, as was his prerogative as the top target in the summer\u2019s star-laden free agency class. His delayed decision hamstrung the Lakers from making other moves as they held out hope that Leonard would sign with them.\n\nJames took a diplomatic when discussing Leonard\u2019s process, which makes sense considering James has certainly taken his own cutthroat strategies to his own business decisions. Game respects game.\n\nLeBron not dishing the details\n\nStory continues\n\nHe drew the line at discussing exactly what he said to Leonard as he made his Lakers pitch.\n\n\u201cUm, we don't really talk about what happens on my phone,\u201d James said.\n\nDavis worried he overstepped\n\nDavis, meanwhile, says he enjoyed the process of trying to lure Leonard, but fears he may have stepped over a line.\n\n\"We had one conversation, and I think he came out with a statement, or his uncle or something ... somebody said he don't really like all the recruitment and all that stuff, so I felt like I overstepped my boundaries.\u201d\n\nHe said he has no regrets, though. You\u2019ve got to shoot your shot.\n\n\u201cIt was a fun process. I would do it all over.\"\n\nNow, instead of the Lakers fielding a seemingly unstoppable Big 3, they\u2019ll compete with the Clippers as the preseason title favorites in the most open NBA championship field since the Golden State Warriors began their run of five straight Finals appearances.\n\nIt\u2019s not a bad consolation prize for a team that missed the playoffs last year.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "LeBron James opened up on the recruitment process of Kawhi Leonard ahead of Tuesday's Lakers-Clippers game.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.KFgEFxslrNIASRw7VWLtw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MzAuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Fyo9SY2LYW9L_IFynFZQcg--~B/aD0yNjk5O3c9MzcxNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/70b7d910-f526-11e9-b699-e655a495638b", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
