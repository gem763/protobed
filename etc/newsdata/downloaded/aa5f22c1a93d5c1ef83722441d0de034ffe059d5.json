Ketchup on cereal? Buzz60\u2019s TC Newman tells you what science has to say about pregnancy cravings. Buzz60\n\nA study published Monday suggests prenatal stress in pregnant women may affect the sex of the baby and be associated with some forms of birth complications.\n\nResearchers at Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital found that stressed mothers are less likely to give birth to a male child.\n\nThe findings, which were published in the National Academy of Sciences' official peer-reviewed journal PNAS, were based on data gathered from 187 pregnant women divided into three groups: healthy women (66.8% of the study), psychologically stressed women who were found to have depression and anxiety (17.1%) and physically stressed women found to have higher blood pressure and higher caloric intake (16%).\n\nPhysically stressed mothers also were more likely to have premature births and decreased fetal heart rate and movement, which researchers suggest may affect central nervous system development. All of the women had healthy pregnancies.\n\n\u201cThe womb is an influential first home, as important as the one a child is raised in, if not more so,\u201d said lead author Catherine E. Monk, professor of medical psychology at Columbia University, in a statement.\n\nMonk told USA TODAY that her team wanted to understand the degree to which maternal stress affects the child and the mother, as well as the different types of stress that come into play.\n\nPregnancy experts commonly accept that prenatal stress has an affect on a mother's pregnancy, but the \"exact mechanism\" of how stress affects pregnant women's birth outcomes is unclear \u2014 a limitation pointed out by the study.\n\nDr. Cecilia T. Gambala, the director of OB-GYN student education at Tulane University Medical School, told USA TODAY in an email that much of the published data on how stress affects pregnant women \"demonstrate\" associations between stress and birth outcomes, but do not specify cause. Gambala was not involved in the new study.\n\nThe reason for male fetuses not surviving under times of maternal stress are unclear and require further research, Gambala said, but \"increased adaptability\" has been seen in female babies.\n\nHowever, the correlation between stress and a decrease in male births is not unprecedented, Monk said.\n\n\"Significant stressors such as President Kennedy\u2019s (assassination) and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, are associated with changes in the ratio of males to females born such that fewer males were born,\" she told USA TODAY.\n\nA 2006 study of 700,000 births in New York City found that the likelihood of a male birth decreased to its lowest level in the months following 9/11.\n\nAlthough pregnant women are typically more likely to have male babies than female babies at a ratio of 100 girls to 105 boys, which is known as the sex ratio, the study found that women who are psychologically stressed had two male births for every three female births.\n\nThe results were more drastic for pregnant women who showed signs of physical stress: for every four male births, women had nine female births.\n\nIt is unclear how stress is transmitted to a fetus, though Monk said that animal studies show that stress hormones are elevated during times of stress.\n\n\u201cStress can also affect the mother\u2019s immune system, leading to changes that affect neurological and behavioral development in the fetus.\" Monk said in a statement.\n\nA crucial factor into reducing stress in pregnant women, the study suggests, is maintaining a strong social support system.\n\n\"Pregnancy is an ideal time for reflecting on what kind of social support one is experiencing and whether some is missing, and identifying steps to make some changes,\" Monk told USA TODAY. There are different types of support mothers can receive: emotional support and \"actionable\" support, such as running errands.\n\nFollow Joshua Bote on Twitter: @joshua_bote\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/10/18/stressed-pregnant-women-less-likely-birth-boys-study/3986574002/", "description": "Columbia University researchers found that stressed mothers are less likely to have male births, as well as an increase in some birth complications.", "authors": ["Joshua Bote", "Published P.M.
