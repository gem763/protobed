Get this: she also supports suspending welfare payments of activists.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers should not be \u00adexpected to subsidise the protests of others. Protesting is not, and never will be, an exemption from a welfare recipient\u2019s mutual obligation to look for a job,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like there was some sort of method in these dual media spots.\n\nDutton\u2019s weekly appearances on Hadley\u2019s show have given him a clear and obvious path towards badmouthing and tearing down Queensland\u2019s Labor government. Not one to miss an opportunity, Dutton and Hadley zeroed in on Palaszczuk, calling her \u201chopeless\u201d and \u201ccontrolled by [deputy premier] Jackie Trad.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how the media works, folks: make sure you have friends in high places.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Esposito"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1140277791.jpg"}
