We didn\u2019t play well today. We need to be better tomorrow.\u201d\n\nDetroit (44-104) has lost two of the first three games of the four-game series against the Orioles (49-100), opening a 4\u00bd-game advantage for the worst record in the major leagues. Any combination of 10 Tigers losses and Orioles wins would clinch the top pick for Detroit in a draft highlighted by Arizona State first baseman Spencer Torkelson and Georgia pitcher Emerson Hancock.\n\nBaltimore took Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman with the top pick this year after finishing 47-115 last season. Detroit selected Auburn pitcher Casey Mize with the No. 1 selection in 2018, a year after going 64-98.\n\nDetroit trailed 6-2 before a 39-minute rain delay in the middle of the sixth inning.\n\n\u201cThe game had no pace, with a lot of walks, and that means our guys are standing around in the field and losing their edge,\u201d Gardenhire said. \u201cI think that got even worse after the rain.\u201d\n\nBaltimore\u2019s bullpen took over after the delay, striking out nine in four scoreless innings.\n\n\u201cThey did a really nice job, but we gave them a breather by adding on some runs,\u201d Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been one of our strong suits this season, so it was good to see.\u201d\n\nBaltimore won a night after blowing leads in the ninth and 12th innings of an 8-4 defeat that ended with John Hicks\u2019 grand slam.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve done really well in bounce-back games,\u201d Rio Ruiz said. \u201cIt is huge to come back today and do what we did.\u201d\n\nJackson (3-10) gave up seven hits and two walks in five-plus innings, dropping to 0-6 with a 11.47 ERA in his last five starts.\n\nAsher Wojciechowski (3-8) won for the first time since July 26, allowing two runs and eight hits in five innings. He had been 0-5 in his previous eight starts.\n\nTrailing 2-1, the Orioles took the lead in a three-run third that included Dwight Smith Jr.\u2019s two-out triple, Hanser Alberto\u2019s run-scoring bunt single and tiebreaking two-run homer by Ruiz. Baltimore broke open the game on two-run singles by Jonathan Villar off Nick Ramirez in the sixth and Anthony Santander against Matt Hall in the eighth. Santander stopped an 0-for-27 slide.\n\nThe game was delayed by rain for 39 minutes in the bottom of the sixth.\n\nTIGERS CLOSE IN ON LOSS RECORD\n\nDetroit is 20-54 at home with seven games left at Comerica Park. The big league record of 59 losses was by the 1939 St. Louis Browns.\n\nHONORING CHACE NUMATA\n\nAll of the Tigers in the first inning walked to the plate to \u201cGive It Up\u201d by KC and the Sunshine Band in honor of Chace Numata. The catching prospect, who used that as his walk-up song with Double-A Erie, died on Sept. 2 after a skateboarding accident. His family donated his liver, pancreas, heart and both kidneys to patients in need.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBaltimore LHP John Means (10-10, 3.47) and Detroit LHP Tyler Alexander (0-3, 5.40) are slated to start Monday\u2019s series finale. \u201cThis is a weird feeling,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cI thought maybe tomorrow was a holiday or something, because staying on a Sunday night and playing at 4 on Monday afternoon is definitely different.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In the big picture, the Detroit Tigers are helping themselves with a bad finish to a terrible season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Hogg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/orioles_tigers_baseball_37250_c0-204-4823-3016_s1770x1032.jpg?d9d644c717d77a0620e5086ce062ac8e25e703fd", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
