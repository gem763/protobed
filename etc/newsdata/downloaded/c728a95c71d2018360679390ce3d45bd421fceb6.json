When teen girls come together, they become even more powerful, as evidenced by some truly exquisite new TikTok content: a nonsensical hoax in which teen girls are claiming that they eat their used tampons to reabsorb any blood they\u2019ve lost.\n\nThis TikTok trend started, as they pretty much all do, with one sharp-minded (and probably slightly bored) girl. A few months back, 18-year-old Caroline Majcher uploaded a video in which she performatively complained about how \u201cguys are so clueless.\u201d Then, she offered her evidence for this claim: that they \u201chad no idea that girls eat their tampon after they\u2019re done with it to reabsorb all the blood that they just lost.\u201d\n\nWhile this piece of high art is objectively hilarious, it didn\u2019t exactly garner widespread acclaim when Majcher uploaded it. But in the past week, something beautiful happened: Other teen girls, none of whom appear to have been in on Majcher\u2019s joke, started to post their own versions of the tampon-eating videos. \u201cWhy do boys still not believe that we eat our tampons to reabsorb the blood we lost??\u201d reads the text on one video. In another video, one TikToker wrote, \u201cWhy don\u2019t any of the guys believe us?\u201d In the comment section under the latter video, one user responded, \u201cBoys will never understand.\u201d\n\nOkay, but \u2026 do they? As in, are some teenage boys so gullible that they actually believe girls eat their bloody tampons? Majcher said in an interview with BuzzFeed News, \u201cI thought I could probably make up a lie about girls and any boy would believe it,\u201d but it\u2019s not exactly clear they do. There are some TikTok videos of boys responding to the hoax, but it\u2019s difficult to discern if they\u2019re genuinely convinced or just playing along with it.\n\nIn fact, after doing a deep dive into this mad hoax, I don\u2019t even know if I want puberty-aged boys to believe the unhinged claim. It would probably bring the teen girls immense happiness if they did, but for the sake of teen boys\u2019 health, I hope they don\u2019t.\n\nStay in touch.
