He said the baby was discovered in an \u201coversized belt bag\u201d and that Talbot had not presented the baby for declaration to immigration officials.\n\nSecurity images released to CNN showed a woman in blue jeans and a dark jacket standing in line at security with a bag slung over her shoulder and then sitting in the airport after she was detained.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to CNN Philippines, Talbot claimed she was related to the baby but had no documentation to prove it. The child did not have identification, and the nationality was not immediately known. The country requires an application, travel documents and written consent from a parent or legal guardian for Filipino minors to travel to a foreign country with another person.\n\nThe woman was turned over to the National Bureau of Investigation, and the Philippine Justice Department will determine any criminal liability, Mabulac said. He said he was prohibited from releasing the child\u2019s identity.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It was not immediately clear whether Talbot had retained legal representation.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to CNN, Immigration Port Operations Division chief Grifton Medina said the baby is in the care of the Social Welfare Department.\n\nAD\n\nAirport General Manager Ed Monreal said this was the first such incident in recent memory involving a child. In the past year, Philippine authorities have seized or found drugs, endangered wildlife and other contraband at the airport. In 2015, a Papua New Guinea national reportedly tried to smuggle her 2-month-old son out of Manila in a backpack.\n\nRead more:\n\nThis fisherman lost everything in Hurricane Dorian, including his wife\n\nPolice spent years looking for a serial rapist.
