Wayne Taylor\n\nLike most things, proxy firms exist on a spectrum. Some aren't worth the subscription. But we wouldn't have thought PIRC, which as one of the world's very first shareholder advisory firms is a rather big deal in the UK, would fall into the latter camp.\n\nIts error-ridden report on Telstra's upcoming AGM doesn't bode well for any hopes of it growing its business locally.\n\nTake its reasoning for opposing resolution 4, which proposes to grant Telstra chief Andy Penn a mix of restricted shares and performance rights. PIRC stated that \"[Telstra's] board is seeking shareholder approval ... for equity grant of performance to CEO of the company, Scott Charlton, of up to 372,187 performance shares [sic]\". That would be news to just about everyone, not least the chief of Transurban.\n\nBut even if PIRC had managed to correctly identify Telstra's CEO, it still managed to misread the motion. Telstra doesn't propose to grant Penn 372,187 performance shares, but 372,187 restricted shares. Along with 558,281 performance shares. They're not the same thing.\n\nThe sloppiness continued in the very next line, which described the grants in resolution 4 as being worth 400 per cent of Penn's fixed remuneration \u2013 which, PIRC notes, is \"considered to be the maximum opportunity under the plan for the CEO\".", "description": "It's not just sell-side research that leaves something to be desired.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2043%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e970f6bfd038f99f7c6fc447415258db97e0a693", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
