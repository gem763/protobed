It is because this shambolic Parliament will not do its political, constitutional and moral duty. And chief among those to blame are the wreckers led by ex-Tories Oliver Letwin, Dominic Grieve and Philip Hammond.\n\nThey have just one hope of entering the history books: with little or nothing to show for their lengthy political careers, they think they can achieve stardom by stopping Brexit.\n\nTaking their ground on the principle ascribed to the great Anglo-Irish statesman, Edmund Burke, they believe that MPs owe the electors not their obedience but their judgment. An arguable point \u2013 but an irrelevant one. For they have no judgment.\n\nDespite his naive charm \u2013 now wearing thin \u2013 Sir Oliver has never demonstrated any kind of judgment or practical common sense in anything.\n\nOnly he could now argue, and probably even believe, that he is supporting Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s deal by delaying it.\n\nYet the practical effect is that the deal is now open to being subverted by further delays and demands for a second referendum.\n\nEx-Tories Dominic Grieve (left) and Philip Hammond (right) are also among the wreckers\n\nWhen it comes to former Attorney General Grieve and ex-Chancellor Hammond, the stench of bitterness and rancour is there for all to see.\n\nThey were shamefully putting their personal vendettas above our country\u2019s national interest.\n\nIt is possible that some further dose of national humiliation will yet be forced on Britain by the parliamentary wreckers before the Brexit trauma ends.\n\nThe tutors of today\u2019s Letwins, Grieves and Hammonds are such anti-Thatcher Conservative grandees as Sir John Major, Michael Heseltine and Ken Clarke. And their behaviour is roughly what one would expect.\n\nIf the grandees\u2019 rhetoric is more extreme and the ambitions more bizarre than in the past \u2013 in Mr Clarke\u2019s case, it seems, to become an anti-Brexit Prime Minister without a sliver of legitimacy or scintilla of a mandate \u2013 one should put this down to the fact that in today\u2019s politics almost anything goes.\n\nFor Sir John \u2013 a former Prime Minister who himself once sought a prorogation of Parliament for dubious political ends \u2013 to testify in court against the actions of his successor marked not just gross hypocrisy but a form of derangement.\n\nTo frustrate Brexit, it seems, any disgraceful behaviour is condoned. No one suggests, for instance, that it constitutes a kind of treason to plead, as a group of Remainer MPs did, with the European Union to reject the PM\u2019s proposals at a moment of grave national crisis.\n\nBut, quite unexpectedly for most Westminster watchers, a genuine national political hero has emerged \u2013 shaggy, impulsive, flawed, but transparently patriotic and with the essential attributes of courage, luck and shrewdness that constitute practical statesmanship.\n\nTo be numbered among the greats \u2013 such as Margaret Thatcher \u2013 Boris Johnson will have to last a few more years.\n\nBut already in a very special sense he is her successor because he has been grappling with the problem of Europe that she knew she never mastered \u2013 to her regret. Describing in her memoirs that bitter EU Rome summit of October 1990 \u2013 the last before she was thrown out of office \u2013 when Brussels decided to press ahead with political and economic union under what would become the Maastricht Treaty, she writes: \u2018They were not interested in compromise. My objections were heard in stony silence.\n\n\u2018I now had no support. I just had to say no.\u2019\n\nHad Mrs Thatcher remained in office, and not been replaced by the malleable and mediocre John Major, she would have vetoed that process of ever greater union, and Britain would not have been faced with the present traumas.\n\nFurther European integration would have had to take place under new treaties. Mrs Thatcher, though, was ousted by plotters \u2013 and here the continuity becomes evident.\n\nSo it is not just since 2016 that the British people have been arguing about Europe. It began in the late 1980s under Mrs Thatcher, who in retirement concluded that we must leave altogether, and it has continued increasingly loudly and bitterly ever since.\n\nApart from the puffed-up political popinjays in Parliament, everyone else is by now desperately tired of it all.\n\nTo ordinary people, the referendum result was decisive. Whichever way they voted, most just want it done, and to move on to other things.\n\nOpinion polls confirm this \u2013 if anything they suggest a strengthening in Brexit support and a wide and growing degree of acceptance of a No-Deal Brexit, if that finally proves necessary.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s proposed deal will, therefore, certainly play well in the country as Britain gears up for an early General Election.\n\nThe immediate future, depending on the antics of parliamentary poseurs, on uncertain parliamentary arithmetic and on the shameless partisanship of Speaker John Bercow, is unpredictable.\n\nThe PM\u2019s deal may or may not, this time round, survive. But the British people do in the end have the final say.\n\nAnd when they speak, it looks increasingly likely that Mr Johnson will be returned as Prime Minister with a working majority and a mandate to restore the standing of a sovereign Britain.\n\nROBIN HARRIS was Margaret Thatcher's former speechwriter, policy adviser and biography", "description": "Brexit has become a never-ending national crisis for one reason only, writes ROBIN HARRIS.
