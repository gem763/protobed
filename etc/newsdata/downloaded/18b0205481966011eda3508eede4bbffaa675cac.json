It falls short of proposing four free years of college, as his top progressive rivals in the 2020 primary, Sens.

Sanders has proposed eliminating all existing debt, and Warren has proposed a plan to eliminate about 95 percent of it.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is proposing a program that would make $10,000 of debt relief for Americans who are public servants, including individuals working in schools, government and other non-profit settings.\n\nAnd he\u2019s calling to more than halve payments on undergraduate federal student loans. Americans making less than $25,000 would not owe any payments. Everyone else would pay 5 percent of their discretionary income over $25,000 toward their loans.\n\nBiden is also proposing to double the maximum value of Pell grants to allow more Americans to participate in the program.\n\nPell grants in the 1970s covered roughly 70 to 80 percent of the cost of a four-year public institution, but cover about 30 percent today, according to the Biden campaign.
