It was unclear whether those patients had resumed vaping, or had other reasons for a relapse, including improper tapering down from steroid treatments given in the hospital.\n\nPatients who were hospitalized experienced symptoms of coughing, shortness of breath or chest pains, and some also have experienced nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, as well as fatigue, fever or weight loss, the CDC said.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s Forensic Chemistry Center in Cincinnati has received more than 700 devices, cartridges and packages from state health agencies and patients for the investigation, said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products. Not all all products can be tested because some are empty or have very little liquid, he said.\n\nHowever, the FDA still is testing for a THC cutting agent, vitamin E acetate, Zeller confirmed. Vitamin E acetate was found in 37 tested vape cartridges at levels between 23 to 88 percent, he said. The agency also is testing for heavy metals, pesticides and other adulterants and poisons, he said.\n\nThe outbreak has been observed primarily in young men, with 80 percent of reported patients under age 35 and more than one-third of patients under the age of 20, the CDC said Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Thursday announced a 120-day ban of all flavored vaping products, including nicotine cigarettes and THC vapes. Those vapes are sold legally in Washington at recreational and medical marijuana dispensaries.\n\nFlavors of THC vapes that are now banned include fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey, dessert, alcoholic beverage, candy, mint, wintergreen and herb spice. Industry leaders say that the best-selling THC vape products sold in the state are flavored.\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait to act on this very important public health issue,\u201d Inslee said in a statement. \u201cIt comes down to protecting the health of Washingtonians, especially young people. These emergency rules will help protect public health and safe lives.\u201d\n\nLast month, Inslee asked the Washington State Board of Health to craft new rules regulating vaping products in the state.\n\nSimilar bans of flavored vaping products have been challenged in court in Massachusetts and Michigan.", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Customs officials are inspecting postal facilities to help trace the supply chain of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
