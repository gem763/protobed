Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!,' he wrote on Twitter.\n\nAnd he predicted dire consequences if a Democrat did win the 2020 election.\n\n'Our record Economy would CRASH, just like in 1929, if any of those clowns became President!,' he tweeted.\n\nDonald Trump went on an early morning Twitter storm to trash his political rivals, tout his own record and predict a stock market crash if he loses in 2020\n\nHe also argued Democrats have no case in their impeachment inquiry.\n\n'Republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt. No lawyers, no questions, no transparency! The good news is that the Radical Left Dems have No Case. It is all based on their Fraud and Fabrication!,' he wrote.\n\nThe president went on to brag about his record, including his approval rating among Republicans, recent GOP wins in House special elections and the fact Republicans kept the Democratic candidate in Louisiana's governor's race from hitting the 50 per cent mark and thereby forcing a run-off election.\n\nHe also argued impeachment will give Republicans back the House in next year's election.\n\n'95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! Just won two Congressional Seats in North Carolina, & a Governors runoff in Louisiana, which Republicans should now win! Because of Impeachment Fraud, we will easily take back the House, add in the Senate, & again win Pres!,' he tweeted.\n\nIt's unclear where the president gets his 95 per cent approval ratings among Republicans. Most polls show him with approval in the high 80s among members of his own party.\n\nAdditionally, his warning about the stock market come amid worries the U.S. economy may take a dip going into next year's election with economists claiming Trump's trade war with China as one of the factors that could cause a recession.\n\nAdministration officials have down played any concerns but the president has made a strong American economy the central focal point of his re-election campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, during Tuesday night's fourth debate in Ohio, all the Democratic candidates on stage were in agreement about pursuing an impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nAnd the top three Democratic candidates - Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders - have led Trump in head-to-head matchups in the most recent round of polls.\n\nMeeting for the first time since Speaker Nancy Pelosi proclaimed a formal impeachment inquiry, the Democratic contenders blasted Trump\u2019s push to have Ukraine investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, and accused him of self-dealing and 'selling out' the American people.\n\nWarren, who has jumped in the polls, fielded the first question at the debate. An early caller for Trump\u2019s impeachment, she said: 'This president has obstructed justice and had done it repeatedly,' Warren said.\n\n'Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences,' Warren continued.\n\nSanders, on stage for the first time since his heart attack, called Trump: 'The most corrupt president in the history of this country.'\n\nAll the Democratic candidates at Tuesday night's debate agreed on impeaching Trump\n\nImpeachment was one of the first questions put to the Democratic field\n\nSanders accused Trump of 'enriching himself while using the Oval Office \u2026 in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehensible.'\n\nHe called for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to 'do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.'\n\nBiden, whose son Hunter\u2019s business in Ukraine featured in Trump\u2019s push for a probe by the Ukrainian government, called Trump 'the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history.'\n\nThe former vice president delivered yet another defense of his son, on a day when Hunter Biden told ABC he would forego foreign work if his father wins the presidency, acknowledged some responsibility for the appearance of favoritism, and admitted he got jobs due to his father\u2019s name.\n\n'My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States in rooting out corruption in Ukraine,' Joe Biden said when pressed on the issue \u2013 while seeking to steer clear of details.\n\n'My son\u2019s statement speaks for itself what I think is important is we focus on why it\u2019s so important to remove this man from office,' Biden said. 'Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs, have already proven that they are in fact flat lying,' Biden intoned, referencing Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who pushed Ukraine to probe the Bidens.\n\nBiden argued the focus should be on Trump.\n\n'This president on three occasions, three occasions has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn't want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum,' he said. Trump did focus attacks on as the poll leader throughout the summer while officials were deliberating on how to push Ukraine.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris of California, a former prosecutor, said Trump 'has committed crimes in plain sight.' She said Trump had been 'selling out the American people.'\n\n'On this issue with Ukraine he\u2019s been selling out democracy,' Harris said, standing by her statement that she has seen enough evidence to vote to impeach.\n\n'I know a confession when I see it,' she said.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said he feels as much 'outrage' as fellow Democrats. But he cautioned: 'This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship.'\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota delivered an impassioned attack on Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n'He\u2019s digging up dirt on an opponent. That\u2019s illegal conduct,' said Klobuchar, also a former prosecutor. 'I\u2019m still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again.'\n\n'I would like to hear from him how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again. It doesn\u2019t make America great again, it makes Russia great again,' she said, playing off Trump\u2019s campaign slogan.\n\nFormer Obama Housing and Urban Development secretary Julian Castro said of the impeachment effort: 'We can walk and chew gum at the same time.'", "description": "Donald Trump slammed the Democratic presidential candidates, arguing there was 'NO WAY' any of them could win the Oval Office and predicted the stock market would crash if one did.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com In Westerville"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19785166-0-image-a-3_1571226290418.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
