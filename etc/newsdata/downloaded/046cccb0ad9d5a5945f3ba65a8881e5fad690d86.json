After all, getting America out of fill-in-the-blank \u2014 Vietnam, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Iraq, Afghanistan \u2014 has for decades been the go-to slogan of progressives.\n\nWhy, now, should our retreat from Syria be any different?\n\nIf the argument is that the Kurds stood by us, depended on us, and helped us to wage a difficult war, well, so did many others, such as the Montagnards in Vietnam. If the argument is that our retreat from Syria creates the conditions for a humanitarian disaster, one must ask: Where was that humanitarian concern when much of the left was agitating for immediate U.S. withdrawal from Iraq as terrorist and sectarian violence exploded in 2005 and 2006? If the argument is that we are sending a fatal signal of fecklessness to friend and foe alike, why were so many liberals prepared to give Barack Obama a pass when the al-Assad regime violated his chemical red line in 2013?", "description": "Trump\u2019s foreign policy disasters should lead liberals to rediscover the perils of geopolitical retreat.", "authors": ["Bret Stephens"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/opinion/24stepehensWeb/24stepehensWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
