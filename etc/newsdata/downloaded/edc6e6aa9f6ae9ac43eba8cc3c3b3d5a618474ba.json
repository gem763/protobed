They were WAY too early to raise, and Way too late to cut - and big dose quantitative tightening didn\u2019t exactly help either. Where did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well, you can\u2019t win them all! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2019\n\n\u201cNow, I assume that\u2019s intended to be a biting insult, but Twitter doesn\u2019t actually have a voice, so just typing the name Jerome doesn\u2019t work. I mean, that is his name,\u201d said Cooper (who said Trump was probably using it because Powell is often known by his initial \u201cJ\u201d).\n\nIt contained \u201cno bully bravado\u201d or \u201csnide, slithering snarkiness\u201d and relied on people getting \u201cin touch with their inner bully,\u201d he said. Cooper even tried repeating the nickname in various tones, but couldn\u2019t make it stick.\n\nCheck out the segment here:\n\nTrump takes to Twitter to trash one of the President's own men - his Fed chairman.\n\n\n\nBut as @AndersonCooper explains on #TheRidiculist, where Trump often busts out brutal, bullying name-calling, here he had no \"snide, slithering snarkiness,\" only the man's own name, Jerome. pic.twitter.com/OzK018a03V \u2014 Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) September 7, 2019", "description": "The CNN host dissected Trump's name game and was less than impressed with his latest effort.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d734c9e3b0000ac71d0c10e.png?cache=btc038guj2&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
