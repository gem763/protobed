After a while I said 'OK, let's go'. He said 'No, no, wait, I don't have the picture.' I was waiting in the car and he eventually came back and said 'OK, I have the picture.' He was looking for this picture.\"\n\nBehrakis' description of the image was typically unorthodox.\n\n\"I would love to be this father; I think every child would love to have a father like this,\" he explained.\n\n\"This picture proves that there are superheroes after all. He doesn't wear a red cape, but he has a black plastic cape made out of garbage bags. For me this represents the universal father and the unconditional love of father to daughter.\"\n\nIn 2017, Yannis launched a project to help Reuters build a more diverse team of news photographers.\n\nHis appearances at photo festivals and events around the world inspired many young journalists to apply for a bursary from Reuters. He was very proud of this work, and was still looking for a new generation of talent right up until his death.\n\nBehrakis is survived by his wife Elisavet and their daughter Rebecca and his son Dimitri.", "description": "Yannis Behrakis, one of Reuters' most decorated and best-loved photographers, has died after a long battle with cancer.
