One has the impression the writers are a bit more demoralized than usual. With the constant drumbeat of hysteria from the Left, it\u2019s easy to believe they simply don\u2019t have much feeling left in their funny bones.\n\nBut every once in a while the crew of the long-running sketch show can\u2019t ignore the news cycle and actually come up with something funny. On Saturday\u2019s episode, SNL took on the lates round of Democrat debates, and some of the impressions are spot on.
