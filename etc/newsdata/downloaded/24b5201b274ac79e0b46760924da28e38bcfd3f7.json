Among other hazards, they are threatened by hunting, human encroachment on the beaches where they nest, and pollution of their feeding grounds offshore.\n\nAccording to the Israeli rescue center, only about 20 female green turtles nest along the Israeli Mediterranean coast during a breeding season that usually lasts from May until August.\n\nTo help the turtle population, Israeli nature authorities have declared some beaches nature reserves and with the rescue center have been relocating threatened turtle nests to safe hatcheries since the 1980s.\n\nIn 2002, the rescue center went a step further and began recruiting turtles for a special breeding stock that would one day help populate the sea with their offspring, in one of the world\u2019s only such conservation program.\n\nThe mating squad began to reach sexual maturity a few years ago and this year managed to breed, said the center\u2019s manager, Yaniv Levi. About 200 baby turtles are expected to hatch by the end of the breeding season.\n\nSlideshow (20 Images)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only at the beginning, it\u2019s the first year, and we expect that in the coming years we will be able to spawn 1,000 hatchlings a year,\u201d Levi said.\n\nRoderic Mast, the president of the Oceanic Society and co-chair of the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group, said that releasing the hatchlings to the sea immediately was critical to their chances of survival.\n\n\u201cIn terms of conservation, nothing is more important than protection of turtles and their habitats and behaviors in the wild,\u201d Mast said in an email interview.", "description": "On a Mediterranean beach in Israel, a newly-hatched baby turtle fumbles along the sand, making its way to the sea for the very first time.", "authors": ["Amir Cohen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433740801&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O10H", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
