They include about 2,500 highly dangerous foreign fighters from Europe and elsewhere \u2014 their native countries have been reluctant to take them back \u2014 and about 10,000 captured fighters from Syria and Iraq.\n\nKurdish officials have expressed concerns of a possible breakout by IS prisoners in case of fighting in the area.\n\nAsked about the White House comments, Erdogan said that both Turkey and the U.S. were working separately to see \u201cwhat steps can be taken\u201d so that foreign fighters in prison can be repatriated.\n\n\u201cThis is being worked on,\u201d he said.\n\nErdogan has threatened for months to launch the military operation across the border. He views the Syria Kurdish forces as terrorists and a threat to his country as Ankara has struggled with a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey.\n\nIn the U.S., Republicans and Democrats have warned that allowing the Turkish attack could lead to a massacre of the Kurds and send a troubling message to American allies across the globe.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces, as the Kurdish-led force is known, said the American pullout began first from areas along the Syria-Turkey border. The Syrian Kurdish Hawar news agency and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also say American troops were evacuating positions near the towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe American forces did not abide by their commitments and withdrew their forces along the border with Turkey,\u201d the SDF said in its statement. \u201cThe Turkish military operation in northern and eastern Syria will have a huge negative effect on our war against\u201d IS, it added.\n\nMustafa Bali, the SDF spokesman, tweeted that his group is not expecting the U.S. to protect northeastern Syria. \u201cBut people here are owed an explanation regarding the security mechanism deal and destruction of fortifications,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an agreement between Ankara and Washington, joint U.S and Turkish aerial and ground patrols had started in a security zone that covers over 125 kilometers (78 miles) along the Turkey-Syria border between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. The SDF had removed fortification from the areas, considered a threat by Turkey, and withdrawn with heavy weapons.\n\nBut Turkey and the U.S. have disagreed over the depth of the zone, with Ankara seeking to also have its troops monitor a stretch of territory between 30 and 40 kilometers deep (19 to 25 miles). Erdogan has continued to threaten an attack.\n\nThe Kurdish-led fighters have been the main U.S.-backed force in Syria in the fight against IS and in March, the group captured the last sliver of land held by the extremists, marking the end of the so-called caliphate that was declared by IS\u2019s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe will not hesitate for a moment in defending our people\u201d against Turkish troops, the Syrian Kurdish force said, adding that it has lost 11,000 fighters in the war against IS in Syria.\n\nIt said IS sleeper cells are already plotting to break free some 12,000 militants detained by Syrian Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria.\n\nThe Kurdish fighters also control the al-Hol camp, home to more than 70,000 people, including at least 9,000 foreigners, mostly wives and children of IS fighters.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted that Ankara is determined to ensure the survival and security of Turkey \u201cby clearing the region from terrorists. We will contribute to peace, peace and stability in Syria.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d8/5a/4a0ce8424a249cac1a37a4dd2c70/191007-syria-turkey-kurds-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
