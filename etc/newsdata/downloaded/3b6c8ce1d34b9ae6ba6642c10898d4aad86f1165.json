It\u2019s a healthy debate to have, but we\u2019ve got to do something now.\u201d Buttigieg went on to say the issue could potentially distract Democrats from areas where they could make real advances in gun control.\n\nButtigieg has called for a ban on the sale of certain semi-automatic rifles, but has joined the rest of the Democratic primary field in resisting O\u2019Rourke\u2019s call for a \u201cmandatory buyback,\u201d which would require gun owners to sell their semi-automatic rifles to the government and hold those who refuse criminally liable.\n\nLater in the event, Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has made past headlines with his outspoken support of mandatory gun confiscation, challenged Buttigieg as a candidate \u201cworried about the polls\u201d and who \u201cprobably wants to get to the right place, but is afraid of doing the right thing right now.\u201d\n\nAfter the event in a news conference with reporters, O\u2019Rourke went further.\n\n\u201cWhat Pete has been saying is that a mandatory buyback is the \u2018shiny object\u2019 that is distracting us. How in the world can you say that to March for Our Lives? How can you say that to survivors of mass shootings across this country?\u201d O\u2019Rourke stated. \u201cHow can you say that to the majority of Hispanics in America, certainly in Texas, who fear that they will be the victims of a mass shooting inspired by racism and hatred that has been welcomed into the open by this president, and has been armed with weapons of war.\n\n\u201cI was really offended by [Buttigieg\u2019s] comments. I think he represents a kind of politics that is focused on poll testing and focus group driving, and triangulating, and listening to consultants before you arrive at a position,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think our politics has to be about doing the right thing, saying the right thing.\u201d\n\nAccording to the latest RealClear Politics national polling average, Buttigieg leads O\u2019Rourke by just over three percentage points.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg sparred over the merits of mandatory gun confiscation during a gun control advocacy event in Las Vegas on Wednesday.During a one-on-one with Today Show anchor Craig Melvin, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., was asked a question", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W5I4nAZXkXQ.VczNjt_26w--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/e0db3989751674018516b16c77116801", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
