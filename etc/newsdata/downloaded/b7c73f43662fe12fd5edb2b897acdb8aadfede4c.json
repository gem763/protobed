Based off of the Chuck Palahniuk novel of the same name, The New York Times called it \u201cthe defining cult movie of our time.\u201d Directed by David Fincher, it was a sexy, edgy, and brutally violent meditation on the alienation of consumerism, seen through the lens of hypermasculinity. Roger Ebert even described it as \u201cmacho porn.\u201d It may still generate debate two decades later, but thematically and stylistically, the allure of Fight Club cannot be denied.\n\nEdward Norton had just garnered acclaim for his role as a reformed neo-Nazi in American History X, when he starred in the film as the mysterious character known only as the Narrator. He\u2019s a zombie office worker suffering from chronic insomnia. After his doctor refuses to give him sleep medication, he finds solace in attending support groups, not because he\u2019s suffering from testicular cancer or blood parasites like the afflicted people he meets, but because they act as a sort of release that cures him of his sleepless nights.\n\nThat is, until fellow \u201ctourist\u201d Marla Singer, played by Helena Bonham Carter, starts encroaching on his territory and screws up his well-planned system. But then he meets soap-peddler and anti-consumerist Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, who was soon trading his support meetings for bloodied nights in a basement fight club and adopting a new lifestyle that subsequently leads to literal mayhem in the form of an anarchist army.\n\nWhile some modern critics find the movie to be a symbolic foreshadowing for various occurrences of the past decade, from the financial crisis to the rise of far-right groups, Fight Club had an impact on young men at the time of its inception, especially when it came to replicating the concept of the underground fight club. Adam Driver even admitted to starting his own as a teenager. It may not have made history at the box office, but it certainly resonated with its audience.\n\nThis copycatting extends to the fashion seen in the film. Tyler's look was quintessential bad-boy garb, albeit a little quirky and out of the ordinary. Yes, there\u2019s the signature leather jacket, but instead of the typical black, it\u2019s crimson red. Michael Kaplan, the film\u2019s costume designer, who was also the genius behind the looks seen in the original Blade Runner and the newer Star Wars films, had an interesting reason for his choice of red for Tyler\u2019s outerwear. As he explained to the Independent, he wanted it to be the \u201ccolor of dried blood,\u201d which went in theme with the film\u2019s depiction of violence. Tyler also needed to be sartorially set apart from the Narrator\u2019s ordinary uniform of plain slacks and button-down work shirts.\n\nKaplan kept in mind that Tyler didn\u2019t have money and was essentially squatting in his home. \u201cI decided he was going to be a person who gets great things in thrift shops, because I do that and I know they can be found,\u201d he said. But since key characters require multiples of their wardrobe, Kaplan built the jackets, using a stiff leather material from 1970s. \u201cWe designed it and fashioned it after the way clothes were made then but it looked like it was from a thrift shop\u2014we broke some buttons, tore the lining and put stains on it to make it look like something somebody wouldn't want anymore,\u201d he explained.\n\nTyler\u2019s confidence as a societal outlier plays to his penchant for unique textures and garish graphics. He wears a long furry coat, Hawaiian shirts, a tank top printed with smut magazine covers (which Kaplan said \u201ccaused a stir with the studio\u2019s censor\u201d), and a cropped tee decorated with maple leaves. All things that the Narrator would never have the gall to wear. Even Tyler\u2019s house robe was something of rebellious statement: a lavender chenille lady's robe embroidered with coffee cups. Yet, Tyler\u2019s clothes are still coveted enough today that you can find replicas of almost all of them with a quick Google search. (You can also purchase the same exact coffee cup bathrobe for about $200.)\n\nIf Tyler Durden did indeed inspire men of the late 90s to seek out red leather jackets and postal pants, it isn\u2019t too surprising, considering that every girl I know wanted to look like Marla Singer. When we are first introduced to Marla, it\u2019s almost as if she materializes from a cloud of cigarette smoke. In a furry black jacket, she looks like a macabre Muppet; a manic pixie dream girl for the goth set. She was the ultimate cool girl of the era. But Kaplan didn\u2019t think she had a high, or low, opinion of herself. \u201cI do not believe Marla thinks she is cool (or uncool),\u201d he said in an interview with Clothes on Film. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s that self aware. She is determined and in a strange way, a survivor.\u201d\n\nBonham Carter, who had trouble figuring out her character at first, had asked Kaplan for guidance, and he told her, \u201cThink Judy Garland, for the millennium.\u201d This is referenced during the scene where Marla attempts to overdose on Xanax; she wears a blue sequin dress, which, Kaplan said was a tribute to the legendary singer.\n\nIn contrary to Tyler\u2019s bright wardrobe, Kaplan made sure to dress Marla in dark hues. Her look was curated from a variety of sources, including thrift shops and vintage stores, with nothing brand-new, aside from a Rick Owens jacket. In one scene, Marla tells the Narrator the history behind the dress she\u2019s wearing: a tattered, pink, discarded bridesmaid\u2019s gown she got at a thrift store for one dollar. \u201cIt's a bridesmaid's dress,\u201d she says in the scene. \u201cSomeone loved it intensely for one day, then tossed it, like a Christmas tree. So special. Then, bam, it's on the side of the road.\u201d\n\nI must admit, watching this movie again sparked my desire for a Marla Singer-like, furry winter coat, and I can\u2019t help but think about Tyler Durden\u2019s rant. \u201cWe are consumers. We're the by-products of a lifestyle obsession,\u201d Brad Pitt\u2019s voice echoes in my head as I quietly click \u201cadd to cart.\u201d", "description": "From Brad Pitt's leather jacket to Helena Bonham Carter's bridesmaid dress, costume designer Michael Kaplan explains the message behind the film's iconic pieces.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da5ce91b4f1b80009619683/lede/1571149716127-o-FIGHT-CLUB-facebook.jpeg?crop=0.888888888888889xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
