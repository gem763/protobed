Over an hour or so of frenzied verbiage, he graphically described numerous acts of physical and sexual violence he was inflicting upon the other players within the virtual world. The journalist Julian Hibbert would later describe how this one-off incident profoundly affected the users of this early precursor of a social media community. The utopian idealists of a new digital frontier were deeply shaken, suddenly left feeling unsafe, vulnerable and disillusioned in what had previously been an online safe haven.\n\nThere have been trolls on the internet for as long as there has been an internet. For almost as long, the instruction \u201cDo not feed the trolls\u201d has furnished the code of conduct for users of forums, message boards and social media sites.\n\nWith 30 years of hindsight, this has always been imperfect advice. Victims of targeted harassment learned long ago that their abusers and harassers often react to being ignored by upping the intensity and cruelty of their abuse until it can be ignored no more. Even the progression of ignore-then-mute-then-block does little to obstruct the determined harasser who can be back with a new account within minutes.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

So why am I discomfited by this week\u2019s heavily publicised report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)?\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Like all the best jokes, it carries more than a soup\u00e7on of truth. From the first page of introduction, the CCDH report makes clear that it is a document of advice targeted at \u201cpublic figures\u201d. The famous names attached made clear that this includes not only TV personalities, but political activists and elected politicians.\n\nThere is a clear implication here that \u201cpublic figures\u201d are the victims of abuse who need protection from the massed rabble of divisive, hatemongering trolls. Where does this leave many of the internet\u2019s most pernicious peddlers of hate, who are themselves public figures? Where does someone like Katie Hopkins or Tommy Robinson fit into this equation?\n\nWhatever our politics, are we happy that elected politicians (whether Donald Trump or Sadiq Khan) are encouraged to shield themselves from the disagreement, argument or anger of their electorate?\n\nOf course we can all point to clear, unequivocal examples of abuse, threats and hate speech that could never be justified or excused, but it is far from clear where the line should be drawn. One celebrity\u2019s troll is another celebrity\u2019s footsoldier.\n\nIf a media star chooses to use his or her Twitter to make a highly contentious point about a passionately controversial topic, whether Brexit, transgender rights or antisemitism, are they obliged to discern legitimate, passionate disagreement in response from abusive trolling, or can all detractors be blocked as trolls?\n\nWe can all be better at encouraging and exemplifying online civility. Social media remains in its infancy and so does its etiquette. We need better collective appreciation of the abject cruelty and sadism of the online dogpile. All of us, but especially blue-tick celebrities with large followings, need to learn that quote-tweeting a random detractor \u2013 however stupid or offensive \u2013 is invariably an incitement to their followers to pile on and is itself a form of bullying. The urge to \u201cratio\u201d \u2013 a person receiving a higher proportion of (mostly disparaging) comments to likes and retweets \u2013 a horrendous post is often little more than the seductive pull of vigilante mob justice.\n\nSo yes, we can all heed the advice of the CCDH report; block your trolls, move on. But perhaps we could go a little further. Before we worry about not feeding the trolls, let\u2019s try not to poking them with sticks until they squeal, or unleashing them as our private army in our squabbles.\n\nWhether we count our followers in the tens or the tens of millions, the first step might be to understand that, as in all the best monster stories, perhaps we were the trolls all along.", "description": "One evening in 1993, back in the Neolithic age of digital communications, a character called Mr Bungle logged on to the text-based roleplay community LambdaMOO.
