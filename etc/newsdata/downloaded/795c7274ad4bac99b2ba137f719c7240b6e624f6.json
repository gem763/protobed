He supports a House measure that would bar the president from ordering a nuclear first-strike without a congressional declaration of war.\n\nLeon Panetta, now 79, said he believes a diplomatic approach that extends economic aid to North Korea in exchange for gradual denuclearization could gain traction.\n\n\u201cIn order for that to happen, they have to be at the table,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd that hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d\n\nThe congressman and the former secretary separately voiced another shared worry about exploding U.S. national debt.\n\nDan Coats Daniel (Dan) Ray CoatsThe Memo: Polling points to warning signs for GOP on Trump Brent Budowsky: Deep Throat's defending our democracy Meet the Trump-appointed IG at center of whistleblower drama MORE, director of national intelligence, this week called the situation a \u201cdire threat\u201d to national security. Leon Panetta, who helped former President Clinton achieve a balanced budget and surpluses in the late 1990s, said he agreed.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the congressman Panetta said he opposed the recent two-year budget framework, which included $300 billion in new spending and approval to finance the government\u2019s balance sheet with more borrowing through March 2019.\n\n\u201cThere were some good things in that budget, no doubt about that,\u201d he added, \u201cbut the question that needed to be asked, and was asked but never answered was, `how in the heck are you going to pay for it?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLeon Panetta\u2019s voice rose when he described the nation\u2019s fiscal problems. He identified what he called a \u201ctough\u201d but necessary solution: a five-year budget inked by Trump and Congress that gradually unwinds deficits and debt, to include investment priorities and enforceable provisions to keep discipline in place.\n\nThe two parties must make changes to federal entitlements, raise taxes, and re-adjust spending levels for defense and nondefense programs, the former secretary said, ignoring the obvious hurdles.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, mark my words, this is going to blow on us,\" the senior Panetta said.\n\nPower Politics, hosted by The Hill\u2019s Alexis Simendinger, airs Saturday mornings.", "description": "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta this week said Russia is an ongoing threat to the United States because the Kremlin believes the Trump administration \u201cis not going to stand in their way.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/hillcast_021618_powerpolitics_panettagetty.jpg", "published_at": "2018-02-17"}
