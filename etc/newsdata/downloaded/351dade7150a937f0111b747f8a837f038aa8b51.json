Yep.", "language": "en", "text": "This October brings some real questions about chemistry and baseball, about the Nationals who lead the Houston Astros two games to none in the World Series and all the Nats teams from postseasons past. They are unanswerable. Let\u2019s try anyway.\n\nThe easy narrative about these Nats \u2014 winners of 18 of their past 20 games, the best record in baseball since some (read: me) left them for dead before Memorial Day \u2014 is that they get along, they like each other, they have fun, and therefore they win. It\u2019s an attitude, in this telling, born in the days when the only folks who believed were within that clubhouse.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were just, \u2018Hey, screw it, let\u2019s go out and have some fun and play ball,\u2019\u201d third baseman Anthony Rendon said Wednesday night in Houston. \u201cAnd whatever it was, something clicked, and it turned around and we\u2019ve been trying to ride that wave ever since and keep on just going.\u201d\n\nThere is a chicken-and-egg factor here. Are the Nationals winning because they\u2019re having fun? Or are they having fun because they\u2019re winning? Pull up a barstool. We can debate all night.\n\nWhat\u2019s undeniable is the \u201chaving fun\u201d part. There are so many ways the Nats are expressing that. In Wednesday\u2019s 12-3 thrashing of the Astros in Game 2, right fielder Adam Eaton smoked a two-run homer to right and returned to the dugout, where his teammates welcomed him.\n\nAD\n\nFor months now, the Nationals have been celebrating home runs by dancing. Sometimes it\u2019s elegant. Sometimes it\u2019s awkward. It\u2019s almost always hysterical. It\u2019s become their thing. Fox\u2019s broadcast of Game 2 highlighted it after Kurt Suzuki broke a tie in the sixth, complete with Juan Soto on the drums \u2014 er, I guess that was a water cooler. But when Eaton came down the steps, he plopped down on the bench with veteran teammate Howie Kendrick.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverybody kind of has dance moves, and they do their dance routine,\u201d Eaton said.\n\nAround the all-star break, Eaton and Kendrick, both car enthusiasts, decided to, um, shift gears. (Sorry.) They grab a pretend stick shift, shove in the clutch \u2014 and they\u2019re off to the races.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNow, we love it,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cI look forward to it. I round the bases like, \u2018Man, I get to drive.\u2019\u201d\n\nIs that what allowed the Nationals to beat Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander on consecutive nights? It can\u2019t be. But it can\u2019t hurt.\n\nBaseball is so interesting in this regard. It is a team sport in which every single play hinges on an individual interaction, that between pitcher and hitter. Whether Victor Robles gets along with Stephen Strasburg should have no impact on whether Strasburg can execute a 3-2 curveball with two outs and two on in the bottom of the sixth. Whether Sean Doolittle goes to dinner with Trea Turner won\u2019t affect whether Turner can steal a base or Doolittle can close a game.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, there\u2019s something to this. Strasburg, for instance, is \u2014 how to put this? \u2014 an introvert. Yet late in the season, reserve outfielder Gerardo Parra and fellow starting pitcher Anibal Sanchez, occasionally with help from infielder Asdrubal Cabrera, have engulfed the big right-hander in massive hugs at the conclusion of his outings. They are uncomfortable. And they are a riot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not much of a hugger,\u201d Strasburg said earlier in the postseason.\n\nAh, teammates. They sense that. They know that. So they double down. Wednesday night, they hugged Strasburg. Then they hugged some more. Then they hugged some more. They would not let go.\n\n\u201cYou have to embrace it,\u201d Strasburg said, presumably with no pun intended. \u201cThey start squeezing me a little bit harder every time, but that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAll this gives the impression that the Nats\u2019 love for each other is impacting their results, that if Strasburg received only perfunctory handshakes when he completed his outings somehow he wouldn\u2019t pitch as well the next time out.\n\nAD\n\nChemistry, in an athletic sense, would seem to matter more in, say, basketball, in which the ball must be shared and a hog can ruin a team. Football needs a quarterback to understand where his receivers will be and when, and he\u2019s protected by linemen who must understand the strengths and weaknesses of each other. Hockey requires teammates to know where the others are on the ice \u2014 and where they likely will go next. That\u2019s chemistry.\n\nIn baseball, you can argue that a shortstop and a second baseman must be in sync on how to turn a double play. Outfielders must communicate on fly balls. Infielders must line up to serve as the cutoff man. Everyone must understand the signs. But even so-called selfless acts in baseball \u2014 hitting behind the runner, laying down a sacrifice bunt, taking a pitch off the elbow to get on base \u2014 don\u2019t really involve interactions with teammates.\n\nAD\n\nWhere chemistry matters in baseball, then, is less on the field and more in the clubhouse. It\u2019s not just that a baseball season involves twice as many games as a hockey or basketball season. It\u2019s the hours in the clubhouse before first pitch. It\u2019s the bus rides. It\u2019s the flights. It\u2019s spring training. It\u2019s the February-to-October everydayness, the totality.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe spend so much time with each other,\u201d first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said earlier in the postseason. \u201cIt\u2019s more time than we spend with our families, and it\u2019s not really close. You have to like each other, or it\u2019s not going to be much fun.\u201d\n\nThat can impact performance. That matters.\n\nA final thought on this: The elephant who left the room. Before this season, the Nationals reached the playoffs four times. Each of those times, they failed to get out of the first round. Each of those teams employed Bryce Harper. That has provided some opportunistic folks with a couple of dots to connect: Harper isn\u2019t here, so the Nats finally broke through.\n\nAD\n\nI\u2019m not buying it. Harper is, for whatever reason(s), a polarizing figure in baseball, and has even become a polarizing figure among his former fan base. There is truth in the idea that, in 2018, his impending free agency hung over the clubhouse. He is magnetic. When he\u2019s around, others notice. He\u2019s a star.\n\nAD\n\nBut did Bryce Harper prevent the Nationals from moving on in October? Come on. How\u2019s that possible?\n\nWhat we know is possible is what we\u2019re seeing play out each night of this postseason. These Nationals are smiling. These Nationals are dancing. These Nationals are winning. Assign whatever meaning you want to any of it. Dave Martinez, who manages these guys, has a message for them each day.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHave fun,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cEnjoy the moment.\u201d\n\nThey are. As individuals. And as a team. How much that matters is impossible to say. What we know: It\u2019s damn fun to watch.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.\n\nRead more World Series coverage:", "description": "You don\u2019t necessarily have to get along to win a World Series, but Washington is showing it can\u2019t hurt.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sHBUJV9uYf6MxzLtJUb8l3e4yl0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IXUMEFXWCII6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
