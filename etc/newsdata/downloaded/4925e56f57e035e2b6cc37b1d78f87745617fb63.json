These belonged to a previously unknown military site, which was either a fort occupied by an army unit or a defended compound.\n\nCoins and pottery made in the area for the troops, as well as fine red samian tableware imported from France, were also discovered.\n\nThe find was made by Cotswold Archaeology, which is working with Kier , the construction company, in the run-up to the renovation of a bus station and leisure complex.\n\nAndrew Pye, an archaeology officer at Exeter city council, said: \u201cThis is a very important, and completely unexpected, discovery, in an area that has been heavily changed by previous postwar redevelopment.\n\n\u201cAlong with other recent work in Exeter, it demonstrates just how much of the city\u2019s history can still survive in unlikely places, despite damage caused by bombing and modern concrete foundations.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The discovery was made by Cotswold Archaeology, which is working on the site with Kier, a construction firm.

These include large buildings, forts and military depots.\n\nDerek Evans, the fieldwork project manager at Cotswold Archaeology\u2019s Exeter office, said: \u201cThe unexpected nature of this discovery and the significance of uncovering previously undocumented Roman military features in this area of the city have made this a challenging and interesting project.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to undertaking further analysis of the finds and other material recovered during our works and refining the story of the site\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThe current bus station was constructed in the early 1960s. Any remains would have been destroyed at the time because there was no planning requirement for developers to record such discoveries.", "description": "Remains of previously unknown military site include coins and French tableware", "authors": ["Pa Media", "Tom Holland"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16e88a1db10e521d6f8c028ec7d7d8cb3b80adec/0_231_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eed10dc67763e3962f8ea0413729cba3", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
