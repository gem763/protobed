Eskom\u2019s electricity sales were decreasing and its demand forecast was 52GW by 2050, compared to 58GW forecast in the IRP.\n\nEskom corrected the decommissioning dates in the IRP for some of its aging coal plants, and said it had brought forward decommissioning dates: Komati power station will be shut down between 2018 and 2021; Grootvlei, between 2018 and 2020; Hendrina, between 2018 and 2022; Arnot, between 2021 and 2029.\n\nEskom said the IRP failed to include the amount of solar PV power already installed on rooftops around the country, which the utility estimated to be between 300 and 400MW.\n\nCost of coal 'unrealistic'\n\nEskom raised the issue of pricing in the IRP, and took issue with the price of gas used in the modelling, adding that the IRP\u2019s projected cost of coal may be \"unrealistic\".\n\n\"The assumptions used for technologies are beginning with 2017 numbers. Given the rate at which technology costs change, specifically renewable technologies, this may be a reason for concern.\"\n\nIt called for studies to be done on how stability of the electricity grid could be maintained with the increase in the amount of renewable energy.\n\nEskom also corrected the IRP\u2019s statement that Koeberg Nuclear Power Station\u2019s lifespan had been extended to 80 years by the steam generator\u2019s refurbishment, and said in fact it had been extend from 40 to 60 years.\n\nEskom agreed with the fact that no new nuclear power had been included in the future electricity plan until at least 2030, \"because the earliest plausible commissioning date is expected after 2030\".\n\nEskom said the lack of water in water-stressed South Africa could impede energy development. There was a need for a plan that integrated water resources and infrastructure development to make electricity development possible.\n\nIn particular, the IRP should consider energy technologies that were water efficient.", "description": "In a previously confidential report to government, Eskom has said the forecasts for future electricity demand in the draft IRP were too high and could result in too much new power being commissioned.", "authors": ["Melanie Gosling"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8269/ba6a2151f22d49e3944d555aeaea96c8.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-27"}
