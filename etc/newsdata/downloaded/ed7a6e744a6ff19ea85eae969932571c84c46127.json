Here is the full text of her letter to the prime minister.\n\n\"It is with great sadness that I am resigning as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and Minister for Women and Equalities.\n\nIt has been an honour to serve in a department that supports millions of people and can be such a force for good. I would like to pay tribute to the thousands of people who work for the DWP across the country. They are committed public servants and I am proud of the work that we have done together over the last 10 months to create a more compassionate welfare system.\n\nI would also like to thank you and the Chancellor of the Exchequer for your support in the recent Spending Review. I am so pleased that you committed to spend millions more supporting the most vulnerable in society, and I hope that the Government will stay committed to going further at the next fiscal event, building on the work the department has done.\n\nThis has been a difficult decision. I joined your Cabinet in good faith; accepting that 'no deal' had to be on the table, because it was the means by which we would have the best chance of achieving a new deal to leave on October 31.\n\nHowever, I no longer believe leaving with a deal is the Government's main objective.\n\nThe Government is expending a lot of energy to prepare for 'no deal' but I have not seen the same level of intensity go into our talks with the European Union, who have asked us to present alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop.\n\nThe updates I have been grateful to receive from your office have not, regretfully, provided me with the reassurances I sought.\n\nI must also address the assault on decency and democracy that took place last week when you sacked 21 talented, loyal One Nation Conservatives.\n\nThis short-sighted culling of my colleagues has stripped the party of broad-minded and dedicated Conservative MPs I cannot support this act of political vandalism.\n\nTherefore, it is with regret that I am also surrendering the Conservative whip.\n\nBritain's body politic is under attack from both sides of the ideological debate. I will now play whatever role I can to help return it to a better place.\n\nI have been lucky to have had extraordinary support from my Conservative Association since I was adopted as their candidate in 2006. Three times they helped elect me as their MP, keeping Labour at bay through nail-biting campaigns.\n\nI remain a proud conservative and will continue to champion the values of fairness and compassion, and to support my constituents of Hastings and Rye.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nAmber Rudd\"", "description": "The work and pensions secretary accuses Boris Johnson of an \"assault on decency and democracy\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/118AF/production/_108655817_15888f06-519e-4716-a2cb-738efd2bf82a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
