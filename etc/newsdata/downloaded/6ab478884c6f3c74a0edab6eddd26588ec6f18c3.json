Matthew Stafford surprisingly showed up on the team\u2019s injury report Friday with a hip issue.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Stafford\u2019s back is actually what is ailing him, and it has been an ongoing issue. The team reportedly expects Stafford to be able to play on Sunday, though he was limited in practice Friday.\n\nPeople I've talked to say they'd be shocked if Matthew Stafford didn't start on Sunday. He tweaked the hip but it's not expected to impact his availability against KC. \u2014 kyle meinke (@kmeinke) September 27, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Lions have two other quarterbacks on the roster: Jeff Driskel, a sixth-round pick in 2016 who just joined the team this month, and rookie David Blough.\n\nStafford might face criticism for his on-field performance, but his longevity can\u2019t be questioned. He has been among the NFL\u2019s iron men at the quarterback position since he entered the league. He has started 131 consecutive games for Detroit. Only the Chargers\u2019 Philip Rivers (211 starts) and the Falcons\u2019 Matt Ryan (150 starts) have more consecutive starts under their belt.\n\nStafford has not missed a game starting with the 2011 season.\n\nStafford has played through injury\n\nThe 31-year-old has dealt with injury issues in the past, but he has played through them. His dealt with a back injury all of last season and tore ligaments on his throwing hand in 2016. That didn\u2019t stop Stafford from playing.\n\nStafford has led the Lions to a 2-0-1 start to the season and has been a vocal leader.\n\nStory continues\n\nI love the Matthew Stafford we've seen so far this season. Yelling at his coaches on sideline and demanding more out of his teammates. The pregame \"Us against the f****ng world\" speeches are awesome too. He's leading both vocally and by example. Been fantastic. \u2014 Mike Sullivan (@MikeSullivan) September 26, 2019\n\nObviously, not having their franchise quarterback at 100 percent will diminish the Lions\u2019 chances against an undefeated Chiefs team. But odds are, Stafford will play and give his team a chance.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The team reportedly expects Stafford to be able to play on Sunday, though he was limited in practice Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/O7qbx0BDgp0s0xCGrboKLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MDEuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j5zhe7mf7w.DwQnBLi1llA--~B/aD0zNzM2O3c9NTMwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/4a710af0-e1ea-11e9-bfb7-1ae0ac61d1b5", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
