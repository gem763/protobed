It is natural that one striker, a goalscorer like him is claimed by the people. He scored four goals, maybe he could score five. Obviously people start to talk about if it's Bamford or Eddie.\n\n\n\n'But football changes every day. In the last match before Millwall, the public, the supporters recognised Bamford a lot.\n\n'For me it is very important that Eddie has a good spell at Leeds.\n\n'If Nketiah doesn't do well here in Leeds, the responsibility is going to be mine. That will be fair because Nketiah is a player full of results and as coach, I have to know how to manage all this skill to improve the team.'", "description": "Leeds United head coach Marcelo Bielsa believes he will be to blame if Eddie Nketiah's loan spell is unsuccessful.
