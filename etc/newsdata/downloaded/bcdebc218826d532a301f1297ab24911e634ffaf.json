REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nProtesters belonging to the Extinction Rebellion group have vowed to disrupt the five-day event, where luxury brands such as Burberry, Victoria Beckham and Erdem are presenting their spring 2020 womenswear collections.\n\nThe group, which has staged numerous protests in recent months calling for action to tackle climate change, had called on the British Fashion Council to cancel the event.\n\nWearing white dresses with blood-like stains, five protesters glued themselves to the entrance door of the main London Fashion Week building.\n\nOther demonstrators briefly lay on a pool of pink liquid, which they said depicted blood. The protest took place before the start of the first fashion show, scheduled at 0800 GMT.\n\n\u201c(The demonstrators) are calling for the fashion industry to tell the truth about its contribution to the climate and ecological crisis,\u201d the group said in a phone message to journalists.\n\nAt a time of growing public environmental awareness, fashion brands are being urged to be more sustainable and cut waste.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, BFC Chief Executive Caroline Rush said demands to cancel London Fashion Week did not \u201csolve the problem in terms of the way the industry needs to address the climate change emergency\u201d.\n\n\u201cBy having a platform like Fashion Week, it\u2019s an opportunity to bring designers and the industry together and engage them in the conversation,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to five days of incredible creativity and we\u2019ll be showcasing fantastic businesses, that many of them are already working in terms of how they can address the climate change emergency and what they\u2019re doing to address positive change.\u201d\n\nLondon Fashion Week is the second leg of a month-long catwalk season that began in New York and will also take place in Milan and Paris.", "description": "Climate activists glued themselves to a door and poured a \"bleeding\" red carpet ahead of the opening of London Fashion Week on Friday, seeking to draw attention to the apparel industry\u2019s impact on the environment.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429371411&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0LZ", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
