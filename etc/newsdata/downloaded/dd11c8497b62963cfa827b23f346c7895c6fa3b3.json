Gen. H.R. McMaster, who previously served as President Trump Donald John TrumpDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Trump adviser: 'He should stop saying things that are untrue' US moves British ISIS suspects from Syria amid Turkish invasion MORE\u2019s national security adviser, said Thursday that Trump's decision to pull back U.S. troops from northeast Syria, allowing Turkey to move forward with its long-planned anti-Kurdish offensive, was \"unfortunate.\"\n\nMcMaster, who parted ways with the Trump administration in April 2018 over policy differences, said Trump and others who oppose an ongoing U.S. troop presence in Syria are \u201cmissing\u201d a \u201cmore full understanding\u201d of its importance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI believe that the troop commitment in northeastern Syria was immensely helpful to U.S. security and U.S. interests in a number of ways,\u201d McMaster said at an event at Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where he now serves as chairman of its Center on Military and Political Power.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s unfortunate, I think, about the decision is I think a lot of people who may have been talking to the president or the president himself may not have focused maybe on the importance of that force in connection with defeating the terrorist organization, but also having the influence necessary to ultimately help end this catastrophe across the greater Middle East,\u201d McMaster added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Turkish forces and an allied Syrian militia launched an offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria, to the dismay of both Democrats and Republicans. The Kurdish fighters have proved instrumental in the fight against ISIS, but Turkey considers them terrorists.\n\nThe Turkish advance came after Trump ordered U.S. forces in the area to retreat, paving the way for the NATO ally's move.\n\nTrump has defended his decision as taking a step to fulfill his promise to end so-called \"forever wars,\" even though Pentagon and White House officials have said the U.S. special operators are moving to elsewhere in Syria rather than withdrawing from the country altogether.\n\nU.S. lawmakers in both parties have blasted Trump\u2019s decision as abandoning the Kurds to be slaughtered by Turkey and allowing a chaos that could lead to ISIS\u2019s resurgence.\n\nOn Thursday, McMaster said the U.S. troops in northeast Syria have served as a \u201cuseful means\u201d to prevent Turkey from attacking the Kurds, which he said \u201chas profound political as well as humanitarian consequences in the region.\u201d\n\nHe also said the U.S. troops were important for a \u201csustained effort\u201d against ISIS, as well as ensuring the United States does not cede influence in the region to Russia and Iran.\n\nMcMaster said the United States appears to be on the verge of facing \u201cfour simultaneous crises\" in the Middle East: the Turkish-Kurdish fight; a possibly intensified Syrian civil war; the possibility of destabilizing in Iraq, where there have been massive protests in recent weeks; and an emboldened Iran.\n\nMcMaster called Turkey\u2019s actions this week \u201cregrettable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can only conclude that President [Recep Tayyip] Erdo\u011fan is driven more by emotion, maybe by domestic political considerations and how he wants to conjure up a conflict like this for domestic reasons by bolstering his nationalist base,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a sad couple days, and it\u2019s going to get sadder, I think, as the relationship with Turkey becomes regrettably even more strained.\u201d", "description": "Retired Lt.
