Though not in a strong side, he controlled Southampton's possession from a deep midfield position in front of three tall, tough defenders.\n\nHe did not appear to be the kind of holding midfielder whose first thought was to loan the ball to his defenders and get it back. I liked the way he looked forwards and was prepared to play the occasional risky ball.\n\nHe was hoping his front-runners would give him the opportunity to play penetrating balls and showed a range of passing. Right-footed, he was rarely caught out when in possession.\n\nWhen he did get robbed he was quick to recover and chase hard, tackling back and conceding a free-kick \u2014 'One for the team', as they say.\n\nThe midfielder made his first-team debut in January and has a big future ahead of him\n\nMinutes later another mistimed touch on the edge of the box should have seen him yellow-carded but tackling was not a downside.\n\nHe won nearly all his confrontations. Talking to his colleagues, encouraging and showing some presence, he kept midfield well balanced.\n\nWhen surrounded and taken heavily to ground he was quick to get to his feet, showing physicality and bravery. He looks captain material. Indeed in this game it was mainly through his prompting, encouragement and leadership that his team clawed back a two-goal deficit to draw.\n\nWHAT DOES HE NEED?\n\nPerhaps he could have played further forwards in the formation, where he would probably have made more chances than in this deep position where he had more time and space to play.\n\nIn one attack he hit a cannon of a shot which was deflected for a corner, suggesting once again that in a more forward midfield position he has scoring potential.\n\nIt will be interesting to see his development. Southampton have a history of accelerating youth and in many cases capitalising in the transfer market. The coaches there will know his qualities and I will watch closely how they handle him.", "description": "Our scout is a top football expert who attends matches each week searching for the next star.
