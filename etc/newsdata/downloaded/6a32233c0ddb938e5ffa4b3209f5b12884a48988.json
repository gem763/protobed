Johnson later elicited gasps in the Commons when he said that the best way to honour murdered MP Jo Cox was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrats leader, called him a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon said she felt \u201cdisgust watching Johnson\u201d.\n\nPlay Video 2:43 Outrage as Boris Johnson dismisses dangers of inflammatory language as 'humbug' - video\n\nTory Eurosceptics have continued to rally around the PM, but one nation Conservative MPs are privately feeling \u201ca real sense of doom\u201d about Johnson\u2019s tactics, with speculation growing over whether he could be removed and replaced by someone else if he fails to get a deal. Opposition parties have been discussing plans to force the PM to request a Brexit extension earlier than the current 19 October deadline.\n\nJeremy Corbyn told Johnson there would be no election until he was sure the threat of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October was off the table. But the PM\u2019s \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d bluster continued, with the claims: \u201cpeople outside this house understand what is happening \u2026 The leader of the opposition and his party don\u2019t trust the people.\u201d Martin Kettle writes that Johnson\u2019s plan is to turn his supreme court humiliation \u201cinto rocket fuel at the polls\u201d.\n\nIf last night\u2019s drama wasn\u2019t enough to fill the front pages, today MPs will be asked to vote on a motion to support shutting down parliament for three days next week to accomodate the Conservative party conference. All of which you can follow on our politics live blog.\n\n\u2018Do us a favour\u2019 \u2013 The release of a White House memo detailing Donald Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has taken mud-slinging in Washington to a new level. Democrats say the five-page memo reveals Trump\u2019s devastating betrayal of the country. Republicans claim it offers him complete vindication. Though not a verbatim transcript, the document shows that, after being congratulated on his victory in the Ukrainian election, Zelenskiy thanked the US for its military support and said he was almost ready to buy more American weapons. Trump replied \u201cI would like you to do us a favour, though\u201d and went on discuss possible investigations into Democratic presidential hopeful (and former vice president), Joe Biden. At a media conference with Trump, Zelenskiy said no one \u201cpushed\u201d him over Biden, which Trump immediately clarified as \u201cthere was no pressure\u201d.\n\nPlay Video 2:30 'Nobody pushed me': Ukrainian president addresses Trump phone call \u2013 video\n\nAs Julian Borger writes, Zelenskiy looked like he was going to be sick, in what increasingly looks like a sitcom where Ukraine\u2019s comedian-turned-president is trapped in a Washington whodunnit. In another apparent own goal, the White House accidentally sent its talking points for defending Trump to House Democrats, the substance of which Trump later drew on in a rambling solo press conference in which he dismissed the scandal as \u201ca big hoax\u201d and said he \u201cdidn\u2019t threaten anybody\u201d.\n\nNHS changes \u2013 Privatisation of care will be significantly curbed under confidential plans that health service bosses expect Downing Street to include in the Queen\u2019s speech next month. According to NHS documents seen by the Guardian, local bodies in England would no longer have to put out to tender any contract worth at least \u00a3615,278 \u2013 a requirement that has contributed to a big increase in outsourcing of services and a record \u00a39.2bn of the NHS\u2019s budget now being handed to private firms. The proposals also seek to limit the role of competition between different parts of the NHS, which critics claim has proved costly, damaging and a distraction from caring for patients.\n\nVicious cycle \u2013 People are being encouraged to steer away from delicate wash cycles after research found they can release hundreds of thousands more plastic microfibres into the environment than standard wash cycles. Research at Newcastle University found that because delicate cycles use more water they will \u201cbash the clothes around more than if less water is used\u201d. This results in more microplastics ending up in the wastewater, and eventually the ocean and the food chain.\n\n\u2018Truly toxic\u2019 \u2013 The head of a group of 600 private schools has hit out at the \u201ctruly toxic portrayal\u201d of the sector, in the wake of Labour endorsing a series of measures that would effectively abolish private schools. Christopher King will tell the Independent Association of Prep Schools annual conference today that private schools offer a \u201cpremium product\u201d, without the rote learning and changes inflicted by the previous education secretary Michael Gove on state schools in England, adding that private schools survive because they are better at providing \u201cholistic education\u201d.\n\nPulp diction \u2013 Interactions with Amazon\u2019s virtual personal assistant Alexa could soon become considerably more entertaining \u2013 and profane \u2013 after actor Samuel L Jackson signed up to lend his voice to the device. The Hollywood star is the first celebrity voice to be rolled out on Alexa, in a feature that will be made available to users later this year, for a fee. The Jackson feature will allow users of Alexa-enabled devices to interact with an AI version of the actor developed using the company\u2019s neural text-to-speech technology.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Can Labour unite and plot a path to power?\n\nSonia Sodha joins Anushka Asthana to discuss Labour\u2019s options now that parliament has resumed and the party has backed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit strategy.

You jump out of fear of death, or at least a fear of the painful and ugly version of death that is cancer, or you jump from a desire to live, even if that life will be for the rest of its duration a painful one,\u201d she writes. In The Undying: A Meditation on Modern Illness, Boyer details the mental, emotional and physical journey that was her battle to survive: \u201cYou must have a desire to live, but it is also necessary to believe that you are a person worth keeping alive.\u201d\n\nSport\n\nEddie Jones\u2019s England not only have to contend with a short turnaround but also tricky opposition in the form of USA when the two nations meet at the Rugby World Cup today. Manchester United squeezed into the Carabao Cup fourth round, 5-3 on penalties, after Daniel James confidently dispatched the decisive kick on a night when Rochdale gave Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s men an almighty scare. Chelsea await United in the next round after Frank Lampard collected his first home win as manager with a 7-1 romp against Grimsby, while Liverpool, whose youngsters saw off MK Dons 2-0, will meet Arsenal. No British athlete has left a world championships with three medals clanking from their neck, but Dina Asher-Smith\u2019s form is so ominous that the bookies give her a better than 50/50 shot of writing a new chapter in track and field history. And William Carson, the grandson of the Derby-winning jockey Willie, faces a six-month ban from the saddle after becoming the fourth jockey this year to return a positive test for a metabolite of cocaine.\n\nBusiness\n\nKristalina Georgieva, the new head of the IMF, says the global economy needs to be ready to cope with a fresh downturn. She comes to office as the world faces threats from faltering growth, the US-China trade war, Brexit and potential oil price shocks. Despite persistent fears about the trade dispute, Asian markets were up overnight on renewed optimism about the talks set to begin next month.\n\nThe FTSE100 is expected to open flat while the pound is buying $1.237 and \u20ac1.128 after suffering steep falls on Wednesday.\n\nThe papers\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Guardian\n\nThe furious and dramatic scenes in Westminster dominate the front pages today. The Mirror\u2019s splash is \u201cMan with no shame\u201d, the Guardian reports on \u201cMPs\u2019 fury as Johnson claims to speak for Britain on Brexit\u201d. The Daily Mail has a very different taking, citing a survey it has conducted which indicates voters want an early election: \u201cPoll: give us election now\u201d. The Express has: \u201cFurious Boris: Brexit rebels face \u2018day of reckoning\u2019\u201d.
