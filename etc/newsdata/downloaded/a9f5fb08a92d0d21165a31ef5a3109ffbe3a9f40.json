For some reason a three-year-old boy - Colt - was playing his sister\u2019s hairdresser and he hacked off the hair on her head. Thankfully for her, he actually ended up creating a chic and stylish look.\n\nWhen Breana Naylor and her husband Michael noticed that their kids had suddenly gone quiet, they went to check on them and found the two in a closet with the girl surrounded by chunks of her hair and the boy holding a pair of scissors.\n\nLuckily their neighbor Jen Bullock who is a hairdresser fixed the little girl\u2019s hair and frankly we can\u2019t complain. It's a look and little Kimber is carrying it off really well.\n\nKennedy News And Media\n\nBreana reportedly said, \u201cWhen I saw them I was shocked, but I thought it was funny. I started laughing. My husband came in and he was a little angry at first - until he found the humor in it too. He was upset, at first, that his little girl's hair was now all scattered over the floor. Colt had definitely had a good hack away at her hair, but Jen came to the rescue. I'm not sure if Kimber is more spunky now because of her hair, or if her hair now matches her personality. I think the hair definitely suits her more now.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss 11 K SHARES 14.7 K SHARES 8.4 K SHARES 13.1 K SHARES 7.8 K SHARES\n\nColt\u2019s punishment? \u201cWe had him vacuum up the hair that he'd cut off. I think he's learned his lesson - he won't be doing it again.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s a successful fail.", "description": "Brothers and sisters get in all kind of tussles, more often than not, one of the two end up getting hurt.
