Millions, including many Christians, have taken to the streets to protest a proposed extradition bill.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s legal independence was a hallmark of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement made between the former colony of Hong Kong, Great Britain, and the People's Republic of China. This principle allows Christians in Hong Kong to enjoy religious freedom. However, Hong Kong citizens fear that this extradition bill would give the Chinese government power to extradite Hong Kongers to mainland China at will, threatening Hong Kong\u2019s freedom. \u201cIf this bill was enacted there would be a very high risk of undermining Hong Kong\u2019s independent legal system,\u201d said Wilson Leung, a lawyer working at a pro-democracy group in Hong Kong. Christians in mainland China have suffered brutal oppression under the Communist party's relentless campaign against religion, and Christians in Hong Kong fear a similar fate awaits them.\n\nOn August 23, Hong Kong Christians held a rally to protest the government. They wore shirts bearing Christian crosses and the words \u201cGod bless Hong Kong.\u201d They sang hymns, including \u201cSing Hallelujah to the Lord.\u201d The rally was peaceful. People waved lights in the air and held hands in a mass chain stretching thirty miles across the city. Thousands of other non-Christian Hong Kongers joined the chain, which was meant to replicate the \u201cBaltic Chain\u201d formed three decades ago to protest the U.S.S.R. in Soviet-occupied territories.\n\n\u201cWe fear that Christians in Hong Kong will suffer the same fate as Christians in mainland China,\u201d a pastor at the rally said. \u201cWith our churches being burnt down, our leaders having to be approved, and our Bible being changed to suit Communist propaganda.\u201d\n\nOne Catholic woman at the rally, her face covered with a mask to avoid facial recognition cameras, wore a necklace of the Virgin Mary. She held a copy of the rally\u2019s manifesto, which called for \u201cunity\u201d between all Christians.\n\n\u201cWe created a Telegram group for both Protestants and Catholics for the first time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really communicate until now, but we all stand together against this extradition bill.\u201d Christians (around 480,000 Protestants and 390,000 Catholics) comprise 11.8 percent of Hong Kong\u2019s population. Both Protestants and Catholics have united to oppose the government's extradition bill.\n\nChina has issued a five-year plan to make Christianity more compatible with \u201cChinese values.\u201d In mainland China, it is no longer possible to buy a copy of the Bible online, and existing copies are confiscated if unauthorized. Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists are expected to use only state-sanctioned versions of sacred texts, which have been edited to be compatible with Communist ideology.\n\n\u201cThey have already canceled the First Commandment\u2014I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt have no other gods before me\u2014because it challenges the power of the Chinese President,\u201d the pastor at the rally said. \u201cWhat is at stake for us is really high.\u201d\n\nAt a local Mass on the Sunday following the rally, a Hong Kong priest (who asked to remain anonymous) spoke against China\u2019s investment in 5G technology, and urged instead for \u201cspiritual investment.\u201d During Mass, a prayer was said for \u201cthe victims of the extradition bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fear the repercussions of an entire nation if my identity is revealed,\u201d the priest said. \u201cI also work with Christians in mainland China, so I have to be careful.\u201d When asked what Christians in mainland China have said about practicing their faith, the priest said he couldn\u2019t answer because he didn\u2019t want to put their lives in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cThe situation is very severe,\u201d he said. \u201cJust think about the fact that in many regions, Chinese people have never even heard about God or Jesus Christ. That\u2019s how strong Communist propaganda is.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what he thinks about Pope Francis\u2019s 2018 deal with the Chinese government regarding the appointment of Catholic bishops, the priest said: \u201cAs a Catholic, I have to agree with what the Pope decided for mainland China. But as Hong Konger, I hope the agreement will not extend to us.\u201d Pope Francis has so far remained silent on the protests in Hong Kong.\n\nReligious leaders support the protest, though they also urge both sides to end the violence. The Catholic apostolic administrator of Hong Kong, Cardinal John Tong Hon, and the chairman of the Protestant Hong Kong Christian Council, Rev. Dr. Eric So Shing-it, issued a joint statement on June 19 supporting the withdrawal of the extradition bill and an independent inquiry into police brutality. Other Christian leaders in Hong Kong also blamed the government for the protests. Archbishop Paul Kwong, Bishop Andrew Chan, and Bishop Timothy Kwok wrote an open letter that stated the government was \u201cignoring the real worries and fears among citizens.\u201d\n\nToday, Hong Kong has many crosses displayed on buildings, skyscrapers, and churches. Freedom of religion is protected under its Bill Of Rights. But should Hong Kong gradually lose its autonomy, the fate of people of faith will be uncertain.\n\nAlessandra Bocchi is an Italian freelance journalist.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Alessandra Bocchi.\n\n\n\nBecome a fan of First Things on Facebook, subscribe to First Things via RSS, and follow First Things on Twitter.\n\n", "description": "Millions, including many Christians, have taken to the streets in Hong Kong to protest a proposed extradition bill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/first-things-resources/uploads/article_5d6817d0790bd.jpg"}
