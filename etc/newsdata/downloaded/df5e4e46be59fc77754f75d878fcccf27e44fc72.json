So head instead to one of these 20 lesser-visited Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)...\n\nCranbourne Chase\n\nThis large AONB, which straddles the counties of Dorset, Hampshire and Wiltshire, recently became the world\u2019s 14th International Dark Sky Reserve. It has taken 10 years to meet the strict criteria required, with residents urged to help by ensuring lights are switched on only when absolutely necessary. Linda Nunn, director of the AONB, said: \u201cSeeing stars and their constellations is often impossible because of light pollution. Here in Cranborne Chase we can see the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy, if the clouds allow.\u201d\n\nThe AONB\u2019s dark reputation extends beyond the realms of stargazing, according to Christopher Somerville. \u201cThomas Hardy used Cranborne Chase in Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles as the setting for the rape of Tess by dastardly Alec d\u2019Urberville,\u201d he wrote in 2003. \u201cBy the early 19th century it had become a notorious nest of footpads, smugglers and poachers. These days, however, the forest is criss-crossed with open rides and footpaths, and the billowy chalk downs of the Wiltshire/Dorset border rise clear of the trees as an irresistible enticement to walkers.\u201d\n\nWhere to stay: 10 Castle Street, a fine Queen Anne house, built in 1703, with a magnificent garden, set behind imposing gates at the end of a drive in the pretty village of Cranborne.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/cranbourne-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
