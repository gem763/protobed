He added in that statement that some of the criticism has been a \u201clong way off the mark\u201d because their \u201csanctions are among the toughest in sport\u201d.\n\nThe effect of that three-stage protocol now does seem slightly lessened, even if the empowerment the England team felt in playing on should not now be dismissed. At the same time, the punishment for Bulgaria at the same time feels very lenient, which is precisely why Kick It Out have responded strongly.\n\n\u201cThe current sanctions, however \u2018tough\u2019 Uefa think they may be, are clearly not working and leave victims with little faith in their ability to prevent abusive behaviour,\u201d Kick It Out added. \u201cWe feel Uefa\u2019s entire disciplinary process in response to racial discrimination should be overhauled, and urge them to explain the decision-making process behind their sanctions for incidents of discrimination.\u201d\n\nClubs or federations punished for racist abuse in 2019 Box subheader The Bulgarian Football Union, x 3 The Romanian Football Federation, x 2 The Hungarian Football Federation, x 2 The Football Association of Serbia The Football Association of Montenegro Lazio (Italy) Rangers (Scotland) FK Partizan (Serbia) FC Dinamo Tbilisi (Georgia) Universitatea Craiova (Romania) GNK Dinamo (Croatia) Shakhtar Donetsk (Ukraine)\n\nAnd this is where the fundamental challenge remains. It is still difficult to work out exactly the right response, that has the right impact, in a problem that goes way beyond football. That is emphasised by the following statistic: This is already the 16th time in 2019 that Uefa have had to issue disciplinary sanctions to national federations or clubs for the \u201cracist behaviour\u201d of fans, and that\u2019s with two months and a lot of Uefa fixtures still to go.\n\nThose 16 sanctions thereby cover federations and clubs from 11 different countries \u2013 20% of Uefa\u2019s member federations. Nor should it go unnoticed that nine of those countries come from behind the old Iron Curtain.\n\nThis all further illustrates what Paul Hayward wrote about in an exceptional column for The Daily Telegraph: that this \u201can expression of a Europe-wide phenomenon, an incredibly dangerous lurch back into ideas that thrived in the 1930s\u2026 it has all the makings of a defining generational struggle\u201d.\n\nIt is the return of far-right nationalism that goes way beyond football, so visibly summed up by the sight of black-clad Bulgarian ultras making fascist salutes.\n\nThis is how you get to the dark quirk of a figure like Raheem Sterling unknowingly tweeting support to the Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov for his approach to this situation, even though he is a politician who has got into bed with the far right.\n\nIt is one of the reasons why this is Uefa\u2019s strongest sanction of the year, yet also why some in the game have a certain sympathy for the federation in how you actually deal with this. Simultaneously, it\u2019s why they are criticised for not taking it seriously enough and for not being the force they should. There lies the challenge.\n\nOne high-level Premier League club source maintains Uefa are \u201ctearing their hair out about it\u201d at every single meeting, and have consulted clubs like Juventus on how you deal with ultras. Another high-level Premier League source insists they \u201cdon\u2019t care enough\u201d. A view is they\u2019re too invested in wanting to financially \u201cgrow\u201d the game in these countries, and \u201cback away from the confrontation needed\u201d. The argument there is that it\u2019s still 16 sanctions this year and no visible change, or confidence anything will change.\n\nThis does nevertheless articulate some of the complexities here. Uefa have to make a clear stand, but also want to have a positive impact in a problem that really goes way beyond anything they can do. Would expelling them \u2013 as is a fair argument \u2013 really change views? When would you bring them back, and how would they even illustrate the problem has been tackled? The argument there is that football would really just become a punishment, rather than a potential force for good. Would the right people even be punished?\n\nAs one source maintains: \u201cKicking Bulgaria out isn\u2019t going to make those ultras address their behaviour or views. It\u2019s actually probably what they want, as it increases their power, and shows their leverage in Bulgarian football.\u201d\n\nHow those ultras actually got into the England game remains one of the big unanswered questions about that sorry night.\n\nIt led to the resignations of both national coach Krasimir Balakov and Bulgarian Football Union president Borislav Mikhailov, two previous USA 94 heroes now criticised for a damaging level of denial that only feeds the whole problem. There is already a sense the level of controversy and international criticism has provoked a proper response within the country.\n\nUefa were minded of this when they were considering the sanctions. The thinking behind those is that this is the second instance of racist behaviour at a home match in the last five years \u2013 the first instance was away to Czech Republic. A second instance normally carries a sanction of one match behind closed doors and a \u20ac50,000 fine, so they feel this represents a significant escalation, especially given the financial situation of the Bulgarian federation.\n\nThey are one of the continent\u2019s less wealthy FAs, with an annual budget of \u20ac9m. Given that the gate money for their next match against Czech Republic is estimated to be around \u20ac150,000 \u2013 down from \u20ac400,000 for England \u2013 and there is also a \u20ac75,000 fine, they are likely losing 2.5% of their annual budget. These percentages would represent several million Euro for wealthier federations.\n\nThat \u2013 as well as the distinctive problems with the Ultras \u2013 shows that some of this is down to the uniqueness of the Bulgarian situation. The wider numbers, however, show that racist behaviour is anything but unique. And there is a wider problem.\n\nIf countries start to be repeatedly punished for racist behaviour of fans, why should players from other teams be subjected to that? It shouldn\u2019t be made their problem. It shouldn\u2019t mean players like Tyrone Mings have to run the risk of such abuse.\n\nIt is why there is a strong argument that, if they are not to be expelled, countries like Bulgaria should face an entire campaign with all of their games played away.\n\nBut then we go around again: at what point will they get to prove it\u2019s not a problem? In what way will the sanctions serve to challenge more deep-seated views?\n\nRound and round it goes, a growing problem, that has consumed the game rather than come from it. There lies the greater challenge.", "description": "On the day after Bulgaria-England, one of Uefa\u2019s most influential power brokers was hosting a meeting in London and shook his head as he greeted his guests. \u201cB******s,\u201d was the blunt description for those responsible for the racist abuse in Sofia.
