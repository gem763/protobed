Businesses and individuals in Bermuda will, therefore, be able to use all that comes with adopting USDC to this degree, including products for savings, lending, borrowing, securities offerings and trade finance, Circle explains.\n\nStablecoins are becoming an increasingly more popular option, but unlike projects like Facebook\u2019s Libra which want to create entirely new global currencies, or countries like China which aim to have their own national currencies, \u201cthe broader crypto ecosystem continues to push ahead by building on existing, working public blockchains, and supporting major existing global currencies such as the U.S. dollar,\u201d the announcement says, adding that governments across the world \u201cwill need to respond to this fundamental innovation, and this initiative from Bermuda builds on their broader leadership around crypto and digital asset policy and regulatory issues.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Circle received a license enabling the company to build products and operations in Bermuda that support a broad range of financial services built entirely on crypto and digital assets. Part of that license was permission to operate a payment system built on USDC.\n\nIn related news, Shyft Network, a developer of a decentralized credential verification protocol, said today that they are working on a blockchain-based national identity system in partnership with the government of Bermuda.\n\nWorking with governments to help cryptocyrrency industry actors achieve compliance with regulatory guidances, without sacrificing #individualprivacy, is a high-priority for our network.\n\n\n\nLooking forward to completing the first phase of Bermuda's national #identity system. \ud83d\udc65 \u2014 Shyft (@shyftnetwork) October 16, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, USDC emerged last year, becoming another rival for the most popular stablecoin, Tether (USDT). In September this year, USDC celebrated its first anniversary, reporting that it has \u201cestablished itself as the second most popular stablecoin in the world; it has unparalleled support from more than 100 companies across the global crypto ecosystem; and it\u2019s the first stablecoin to reach USD 1 billion in issuance in less than a year.\u201d\n\nStablecoins by market capitalization, USD\n\nSource: stablecoinindex.com\n\nAdditionally, when Circle and Coinbase partnered up, they also created the Centre Consortium, which is working to establish \u201ca standard for fiat on the internet and providing a governance framework and network for the global, mainstream adoption of fiat stablecoins.\u201d In June this year, it opened the stablecoin network for industry participation and broader membership.\n\n__\n\nLearn more: Is Stablecoin Business Model Stable Or Is It Endangered?", "description": "A big adoption news came to the Cryptoverse today as Bermuda started accepting payments for taxes, fees and other government services in USD Coin (USDC), a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, managed by major players in the crypto market, Circle and Coinbase.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5da/7339d1f278.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
