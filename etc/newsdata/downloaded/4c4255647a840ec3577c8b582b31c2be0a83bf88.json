We don't care, you deserve it.' Because everybody talked about how you looked or how you dressed or the jokes you made.\"\n\nThe actress expressed her thoughts on feminism as well.\n\n\"Even though I consider myself a feminist, I feel like feminists don't want me to be a part of their group,\" Fox said. \"What is supporting other females if there is only certain ones of us we support? If I have to be an academic or have to be non-threatening to you in some way? Why can't I be a part of the group as well?\"\n\nThe \"Transformers\" star said she felt she was \"really dragged through the coals for a lot of,\" her actions, and she feels she \"never really did anything that crazy.\"\n\nFortunately, Fox says she is in a much better place in her life.\n\n\"At that time I felt like I was suffering but now having a different outlook and having grown the way that I have grown, it made me a much better human being,\" she said.\n\n\"Sometimes we look at things because we have a specific map of how we're gonna get to this goal and what our future is supposed to look like,\" she continued. \"And when something doesn't happen we consider it a failure ... But the opposite is true -- the universe is always conspiring on our behalf to weave everything together for good, but you just have to shift your perspective.\"\n\nShe found this sense of hope and attributes it to when she became pregnant with her son Noah, who is now 6 years old.\n\n\"That was the first real breakthrough where my consciousness shifted and my mind opened up and I was able to see from a bird's-eye view and breathe and take it in,\" the actress shared.\n\n\"And then another kid, and then another kid and with every kid I feel like that's always been the doorway into a better version of myself,\" she added.", "description": "Megan Fox opened up to writer Diablo Cody for ET to mark the 10th anniversary of their film", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/megan-fox-01-gty-jc-190919_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
