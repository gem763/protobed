His self-funded 2013 debut, High Top Mountain, suggested the arrival of an arch-traditionalist, a former serviceman and railroad worker, whose vision of country music was rooted in that of artists who balked at Nashville\u2019s tendency to slather everything in a coat of gloss: a defiantly retro reanimation of the late 70s \u201coutlaw country\u201d of Waylon Jennings or Hank Williams Jr. But its successor, Metamodern Sounds in Country Music, was a kind of psychedelic opus, sprinkled with paeans to LSD and DMT \u2013 \u201cwoke up this morning and decided to kill my ego \u2026 gonna break on through and blast off to the Bardo,\u201d opened Just Let Go \u2013 frequently set to music that matched: Mellotron and wah-wah guitars, vocals drenched in spaced-out echo.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sturgill Simpson: Sound & Fury album art work\n\n2016\u2019s A Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth, meanwhile, was a heavily orchestrated concept album that bore the influence of 60s southern soul and featured a cover of Nirvana\u2019s In Bloom, recast as a small-hours ballad, heavy on the weeping pedal-steel. It won best country album at the Grammys, and was nominated for album of the year outright. Cementing his reputation as something of a refusenik, Simpson threatened that if he won, he would simply hand the award to Beyonc\u00e9 and walk out.\n\nNotice has clearly been served that whatever you think the 41-year-old Simpson is, that\u2019s what he\u2019s not, but even so, Sound & Fury is a bold and dramatic left turn: a self-styled \u201csleazy synth-rock dance record\u201d, that Simpson has claimed is inspired not merely by T Rex, but, of all people, La Roux.\n\nGiven Simpson\u2019s previously noted unbiddable nature \u2013 and indeed Sound & Fury\u2019s preponderance of lyrics that wrestle unhappily with the fame occasioned by A Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth\u2019s success and with the machinations of the music industry, or as Mercury in Retrograde puts it, \u201chypocrites building brands\u201d \u2013 you do wonder if announcing that his new album is influenced by a foppish glam idol who made virtually no commercial impact in the US and an androgynous British synthpop revivalist doesn\u2019t come with a gleeful side-order of screw-you to the country establishment. Whatever the reason, he\u2019s not kidding, as evidenced by single Sing Along: a wall of crunching glam guitars and fizzing analogue synths, underpinned by a frantic four-to-the-floor disco beat, with a vague hint of the drum machine-driven fuzz found on ZZ Top\u2019s Eliminator stirred into the mix.\n\nAnd if Simpson is as discomfited by success and critical praise as Mercury in Retrograde suggests \u2013 journalists and people asking what his songs mean seem to rank only slightly higher in his estimation than hypocrites building brands \u2013 then unfortunately, he\u2019s going to have to suck it up for a little while longer. Sing Along, like the rest of Sound & Fury, is awesome: powerful, fierce, irresistible.\n\nApparently recorded while films by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa played silently in the studio, the album is the soundtrack to its own film, an anime loosely based on Kurosawa\u2019s samurai epic Yojimbo. Without wishing to cause despair to whoever ponied up the film\u2019s $1.2m, Sound & Fury is better heard stripped of its visual accompaniment. Without it, the album\u2019s structure becomes thrillingly inexplicable and unpredictable: its songs frequently don\u2019t end, or at least reach any kind of identifiable conclusion. They just crash into the next track as if someone\u2019s frantically switching channels on a TV, or suddenly fade out, replaced by bursts of feedback and electronic noise or burbling synthesiser arpeggios.\n\nBefore that happens, the songs have already done enough to get their hooks in you. Every track, from the agitated faux-rockabilly of Last Man Standing to the fabulous combination of distinctly Bolan-esque boogie and world-weary tune offered up on Make Art Not Friends, to All Said and Done, a wracked ballad that crackles and hisses with distortion, is an object lesson in musical economy. In contrast to the complexity of A Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth, they offer beautifully simple, direct melodies and indelible riffs buoyed by the needles-in-the-red intensity of the production and by the way Simpson\u2019s frequently down-home lyrics \u2013 \u201cTell \u2019em to carve my name on that bar stool, baby, / I\u2019m gonna be here a while\u201d \u2013 rub against the wilfully synthetic but visceral nature of the sound.\n\nIt climaxes with Fastest Horse in Town, a psychedelicised take on old-fashioned, pre-Nevermind grunge: dense, corrosive guitars howling and arcing around Simpson\u2019s voice, the latter rendered incomprehensible with reverb and electronic effects. It\u2019s a hugely exciting end to a hugely exciting album that underlines Simpson\u2019s status as a daring, restless and unique artist. He isn\u2019t the first musician to throw his label a curveball while protesting about the pressures of fame and the grim nature of the music business. That said, it\u2019s hard to think of anyone else who\u2019s done it by making an album as gripping and enjoyable as this.\n\nThis week Alexis listened to\n\nHolodrum: No Dither\n\nStraight out of Halifax: fidgety, sax and synth-driven punk-disco that takes on an increasingly psychedelic sheen as it progresses.", "description": "Another big shift in direction for Simpson, with anime visuals, glam rock, disco and grunge ornamenting never-more-country lyrics: it\u2019s extraordinary", "authors": ["Alexis Petridis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a01677ab1c90c707b9251f9aeaf3ef1a657d1d4/267_434_1984_1190/master/1984.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ba0b4ad23d6f0517919981a3d686bc11", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
