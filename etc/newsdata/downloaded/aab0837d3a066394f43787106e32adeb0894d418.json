Games against the Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai and Shenzhen are scheduled for Oct. 10 and 12, respectively.\n\nLAL release: Kyle Kuzma is progressing with his rehabilitation from an injury (stress reaction, left foot) that occurred while he was with USA Basketball. He has not been cleared for full practice or game participation. He is scheduled for an MRI when the team returns from China. \u2014 Mike Trudell (@LakersReporter) September 26, 2019\n\nKuzma was on the shortlist to make the Team USA roster for the 2019 FIBA World Cup, but an ankle injury sustained during an exhibition against Australia forced him to be the final player cut on the team.\n\nThe 24-year-old Kuzma will now definitely be missing the start of Lakers training camp and the team\u2019s preseason slate. The teams\u2019 opener against the Los Angeles Clippers on Oct. 22 also looms if the post-China trip MRI doesn\u2019t look good.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving its 2018-19 minutes leader in Kuzma being sidelined would obviously be bad news for a Lakers team already thought to be pretty low on quality depth. Kuzma averaged 18.7 points, 5.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists with a .546 true shooting percentage in 33.1 minutes per game last year.\n\nThe only notable young asset not sent to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for Anthony Davis, Kuzma figures to play a major part of this year\u2019s Lakers team.\n\nKyle Kuzma will undergo an MRI after the Lakers' trip to China.
