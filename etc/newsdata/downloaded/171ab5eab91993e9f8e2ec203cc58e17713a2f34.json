The European ban, which encompasses other display-based appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines \u2013 will come into force in 2021.\n\nFlame retardants: what to know about chemicals in furniture and cables Read more\n\nThere is no such wide ban in the US, although deca-BDE, a type of organohalogen flame retardant, is banned in five states. The TVs tested by a coalition of public health advocates found that the Insignia TVs contained deca-BDE.\n\nMike Schade, Mind the Store campaign director of Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, said it was \u201ccritical that large companies step up and safeguard their customers. If government won\u2019t act, it\u2019s up to the business community to mind the store.\n\n\u201cWhy are Best Buy and Amazon allowing these dangerous, old-school flame retardants to be used in televisions that are supposed to be top-of-the-line? Safer alternatives exist, so organohalogen flame retardants have no place in our homes in 2019.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Best Buy defended its \u201clong track record as a steward of the environment\u201d and said it \u201cfully supported the responsible use of chemicals above what is legally required\u201d. It said the units in this report included recycled materials which it said regulators recognize as \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201callow for trace amounts of some chemicals in electronics housings\u201d. It added that the units tested were not from its newer lines.\n\nChemicals from the casings of TVs can leak into the air or into dust that accumulates around the home, causing a gradual buildup in people\u2019s bodies. While it is difficult to blame the flame retardants on any specific case of illness, campaigners say that enough concern has been raised in studies over potential links that a ban is justified.\n\nWhy are Best Buy and Amazon allowing these dangerous, old-school flame retardants to be used in televisions? Mike Schade\n\nThe sampling of the TVs \u2013 on behalf of a coalition of campaign groups including Toxic Free Future, Mind the Store and Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families \u2013 involved removing small pieces of the plastic casings and sending them to a lab in the Netherlands for testing. The Insignia TVs were purchased from a Best Buy in the Seattle area, while the Amazon sets were bought online.\n\nThe testing found that all six TVs contained organohalogens as their primary flame retardants, with all three Insignia TVs containing the deca-BDE chemical.\n\nIn 2017, the US Consumer Product Safety Commissioned urged electronics manufactures to reduce use of organohalogens in plastic casings, as well as in other products such as furniture and mattresses.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s killing us\u2019: why firefighters are battling to ban flame retardants Read more\n\nA spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said the agency proposed a rule in June that would ban the manufacture and distribution of deca-BDE and products that contain it, including TVs, bar a few exceptions. Campaigners say that the agency should hurry up and implement a full ban.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t anticipate any quick move to address the problem of toxic chemicals \u2013 it\u2019s mainly been left down to the states to act,\u201d said Erika Schreder, science director with Toxic Free Future. \u201cAs a consumer there\u2019s no way to choose a TV that is safer. People are being put at unnecessary risk given that there are safer alternatives available.\u201d\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request to comment.\n\nBest Buy said it had \u201ca restricted substances list that our suppliers must adhere to\u201d. It added: \u201cFor organizations to assert otherwise is both inaccurate and irresponsible.\n\n\u201cRegulatory bodies recognize the importance of recycling and allow for trace amounts of some chemicals in electronics housings made from recycled material. The units in this report \u2013 which haven\u2019t been part of our new product assortment for some time \u2013 do include recycled material.\u201d", "description": "Several TV lines on sale in the US contain flame retardants linked to potential health problems, tests by public health campaigners find", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f895d5b0a04d4151ad3dc30b49a797e2eb3dee0/0_70_2106_1264/master/2106.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff594b7c88b9912c254faa608266b206", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
