The snag being that when the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 bats wake up, it may not matter who is pitching.\n\nThe Dodgers pounded the Nats for seven runs in the sixth inning, changing the tempo of both this game and perhaps the series, as L.A. earned a 10-4 win and took a 2-1 series advantage.\n\nEverything seemed to be going well enough for the Nats before the sixth inning. Anibal Sanchez, who manager Davey Martinez opted to start instead of ace Max Scherzer, was brilliant through five innings. He struck out nine in five innings, allowing just a Max Muncy homer.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWe know the Nats\u2019 bullpen is their weakness and in October they\u2019ve countered that by piggy-backing starters. Scherzer was pushed back to Game 4 after coming in relief in Game 2. On Sunday night, the Nats brought out Patrick Corbin, their Game 1 starter, after Sanchez, and that seemed like bad news for a listless-looking Dodgers lineup. Turns out it was exactly what they needed.\n\nA clutch double by Russell Martin made Washington\u2019s 2-1 lead disappear as the Dodgers took a 3-2 lead. Enrique Hernandez followed shortly afterward with another two-run double to make it 5-2 and then by the time Justin Turner blasted a three-run homer, it seemed like the Dodgers were just piling on.\n\nThe Dodgers exploded for a seven-run sixth inning to take a 2-1 lead in their series with the Nationals. (Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSanchez gave up four hits to the Dodgers through five innings, Corbin and Wander Suero gave up six just in the sixth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nationals, to their credit, rebounded right away as the Dodgers unveiled their own bullpen woes. Joe Kelly couldn\u2019t get anyone out either, and the Nats added two mores in their half of the sixth inning to make it 8-4. The Dodgers bullpen did its job from there and Martin added a two-run homer in the ninth to make it 10-4.\n\nNow, their postseason hopes depend on Scherzer in Monday\u2019s Game 4.\n\nWHO MADE THE DIFFERENCE\n\n\u2022 Russell Martin: The Dodgers are so deep that you may not even remember they have Martin sometimes. The Nationals won\u2019t forget him. His two-out, two-run double in the sixth inning is what changed the volume of this game \u2014 and perhaps the series. His two-run homer in the ninth put this one completely out of reach.\n\n\u2022 Justin Turner: It was Turner\u2019s three-run, six-inning homer that turned this game from competitive to OMG Dodgers, but his contributions were more than the homer in Game 3. He had two other hits and remained the most consistent bat (along with Muncy) in a Dodgers lineup that was quiet in the early going of this one.\n\n\u2022 David Freese: Yes, he\u2019s still around getting clutch postseason hits. Freese, who pinch hit for rookie Gavin Lux, came off the bench to notch three hits and score two runs.\n\nMUST-SEE MOMENT\n\nQuite honestly, it was the whole sixth inning \u2014 one big hit after another for the Dodgers. That it happened after being mostly silenced for five innings made it even more important for the Dodgers.\n\nRussell Martin with the go-ahead double \ud83d\udcaa\n\n\n\n(Via @Dodgers) pic.twitter.com/OSdY8NpFDf \u2014 Yahoo Sports MLB (@MLByahoosports) October 7, 2019\n\nWHAT THEY'LL BE TALKING ABOUT\n\nWhether the Nationals have the pitching to beat this Dodgers team. Their pitching strategy was to be applauded after their Game 2 win and half of this one, but it\u2019s becoming evident that they can\u2019t depend on their three core starters to both start and relieve. Can Scherzer give them seven or eight strong innings in Game 4? If not, what will the Nats do? Will a dependable reliever emerge?\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nThis series heads to Game 4 right away, as the Dodgers and Nats meet again Monday night at 6:40 p.m. ET. The Nationals will send their ace Max Scherzer, who last started the NL wild-card game, but did appear in Game 2 of this series with an unhittable relief appearance. The Dodgers counter with veteran Rich Hill, who will be making his first appearance of the postseason. After an injury-riddled 2019 season, Hill isn\u2019t full strength and the Dodgers are hoping for four innings from him. From there? We\u2019ll see.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMike Oz is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at mikeozstew@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!
