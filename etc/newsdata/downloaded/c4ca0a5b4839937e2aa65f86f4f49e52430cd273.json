Until now, Xinja only had a restricted banking license.\n\nLast year, APRA granted its first license to an internet-only banking startup, Volt Bank. Other digital lenders to have received full banking licenses in the last year include Judobank and 86 400.\n\n\u201cI think there will be more to come, it\u2019s early days,\u201d said T.S. Lim, a banking analyst at Bell Potter, adding that fintech firms had not been real challengers of the major Australian banks so far.", "description": "Australia granted a new banking license to online-only banking firm Xinja Bank on Monday, allowing the startup to compete against the country's \"Four Big\" lenders that dominate the sector.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
