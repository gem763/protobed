Any bill from the other house that didn\u2019t receive committee approval is dead.\n\nMarch 30 is the next deadline for floor action on bills from the other chamber, as the session winds down to its scheduled end on April 24.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of the bills of interest that either survived or died:\n\nCivil Asset Forfeiture reform\n\nA civil asset forfeiture reform bill, the Asset Forfeiture Transparency Act, was approved by the Senate Accountability, Efficiency, Transparency Committee on Tuesday and is headed to the full Senate for a vote. House Bill 1410 would require the state\u2019s Commissioner of Public Safety to maintain a searchable database of all property and cash seized by state and local law enforcement agencies.

HB 1116 got a boost on March 17 when Kansas Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer arrived to meet with Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, House Speaker Philip Gunn and other leaders about how a similar welfare reform, with work requirements for able-bodied benefit recipients, helped get people off the welfare rolls and onto the tax rolls in Kansas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually something that everyone agreed on in 1996 with the Clinton welfare reforms,\u201d Colyer told Mississippi Watchdog. \u201cForty-two states have waived out of those reforms. What we\u2019re talking about is able-bodied adults having a simple work requirement. They asked us to visit with them and share our experience.\u201d\n\nKansas tracked its welfare recipients after the work requirement and the results were startling. Their incomes increased 127 percent and 60 percent found work within 12 months of leaving the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program program.\n\nHB 1116 also would strengthen anti-fraud protections on the SNAP and Temporary Assistance to Needy Family programs.

The bill would create a nine-member board to manage Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport to replace the five-member board appointed by the mayor of Jackson. The bill was amended to require that five of the commissioners come from Jackson, with one appointed by Jackson\u2019s mayor and one appointed by the City Council. The key change was a Jackson residency requirement on two of the governor\u2019s picks and the lieutenant governor\u2019s. With the head of the state\u2019s National Guard and the director of the Mississippi Development Authority also sitting on the board, it\u2019d give the governor the power to appoint four of the nine commissioners.

The controversial bill would have required teachers to grade parents\u2019 involvement with their children\u2019s education. DEAD\n\nRelated: Mississippi House passes bill requiring teachers to grade parents\n\nElection reform\n\nHB 797 would overhaul the state\u2019s election system. It was approved by the Senate Elections Committee on Tuesday with an amendment that would end the practice of elected officials being able to to convert their leftover campaign cash into personal income when they leave office.

It was approved by the Senate Education Committee on Tuesday. SB 2161, which would expand charter schools to non-failing districts, was approved by the House Education Committee last week.
