He noted that most people in Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU.\n\n\u201cI know that you understand the impact that a hard border could have on this island,\u201d Mr. Varadkar told Mr. Pence said. \u201cBarriers to free movement of people and frictionless trade, barriers to north-south cooperation and the risk that the Good Friday agreement and the peace could unravel.\n\n\u201cAll I ask is that you bring that message back to Washington with you,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a problem of our making \u2014 it is one we want to solve through an orderly Brexit.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence acknowledged their concerns and put forward a request of his own. He asked Irish officials to help the U.S. box out Chinese companies looking to build 5G cellular networks.\n\nAs it wages a trade war with China, the Trump administration is working with allies on alternatives to Huawei, a Chinese telecom firm the administration blacklisted as an espionage threat \u2014 a charge the company denies.\n\n\u201cIt is well known that Chinese law requires Chinese telecom companies to provide Beijing\u2019s vast security apparatus with access to any data that touches their network,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cWe believe in the United States that there is no place for untrusted vendors anywhere in our secure 5G supply chain.\u201d\n\nThe leaders used the rest of their joint statement to exchanges pleasantries and muse about their shared heritage.\n\nMr. Varadkar noted the presence of Mr. Pence\u2019s mother, Nancy, whose father left Ireland for a life in the U.S.\n\nHe said the story of Mr. Pence\u2019s grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, is \u201can example of the ties of history, kinship and friendship that link our two countries together.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
