Two CEOs? That's ridiculous. That's bad governance,'\" Ellison told analysts at the company's OpenWorld event in San Francisco last month.\n\n\"I believe in a dual CEO structure. The normal case [at Oracle] would be dual CEO here for obvious reasons. That it's good to have capacity and good to have specialization. And then, God forbid, if something untoward should happen, you have capacity, you are not incapacitated.\"\n\nIn fact, Oracle's archrival, SAP, appeared to following Ellison's lead. SAP just announced this week that it was shifting to its own dual CEO structure. The German software giant said its longtime CEO Bill McDermott was stepping down and has been replaced by Jennifer Morgan, who had led SAP's cloud business, and Christian Klein, who had served as SAP's chief operating officer.\n\nIt would seem Ellison meant what he said about the dual CEO structure. At the meeting with analysts, Ellison said he was planning to give the Oracle board give five potential internal candidates in the event Hurd is unable to return.\n\nHere are five Oracle executives \u2014 including two that Ellison himself mentioned at the meeting with analysts, as well as three that experts suggest might make the shortlist \u2014 who could one day serve as the company's chief executive.", "description": "With Oracle\u2019s Mark Hurd on leave, here are 5 execs who could replace him as Safra Catz\u2019s co-CEO, according to insiders and Larry Ellison.", "authors": ["Benjamin Pimentel"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e5869122bd53151383474?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
