Despite beginning joint patrols along the border in September, the two have been at odds over several details of the plan.\n\nThe two countries have disagreed over how far the area should extend, who should control it and what groups should be cleared from the area.\n\nTurkey has said the zone should stretch 30 kilometres (19 miles) into Syria and be cleared of members of the People's Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia operating in Syria that Turkey considers a \"terrorist organisation\".\n\nWashington supports the SDF, which is led by the YPG and was key in defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) fighters in Syria.\n\nTurkey, which currently hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, also says it wants to settle up to 2 million refugees in the \"safe zone\".\n\nSDF warns of 'all-out war'\n\nThe SDF, which is fighting the Syrian government forces, quickly responded to Erdogan's comments, saying it would \"not hesitate to turn any unprovoked [Turkish] attack into an all-out war\".\n\nOn Friday, a group of Turkish-backed rebels fighting in Turkey pledged to back a potential cross-border offensive by Ankara.\n\nErdogan has repeatedly called on Turkey's allies to provide financial support for the \"safe zone\", including in his speech at the United Nations last month, but has been met with a tepid response.\n\nThe plan is also expected to face opposition from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and from Russia and Iran, Damascus's most powerful backers.\n\nThe main opposition party in Turkey, the Republican People's Party (CHP), has also said Damascus should be involved in any actions taken by Turkey in setting up the \"safe zone\".", "description": "Turkish president again threatens military operation against SDF, viewed as 'terrorists' by Ankara.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/5/6bb9cce5a5c049dd8e171db75dc11000_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
