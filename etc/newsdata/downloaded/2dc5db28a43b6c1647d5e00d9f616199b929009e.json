You've endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?\"\n\nWarren: \"So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face.\"\n\nMore:\n\nButtigieg: \"Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.\"\n\nAnd:\n\nKlobuchar: \"At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up.\"\n\nSaying it's her way or the highway on policy: \"My question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax,\" Warren said. \"It's why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\"\n\nKlobuchar countered, \"I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea.\"\n\nPushing for large-scale structural change when nearly half the party doesn't want it: \"Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\" Warren said.\n\nBut here was Klobuchar again: \"You know, I think simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people.\"\n\nIndeed, our September NBC/WSJ poll found that a majority of Democratic primary voters - 56 percent - prefer large-scale change, even if it's harder and costlier to pass.\n\nBut 40 percent say they wanted smaller change, and that's not an insignificant slice of the party.\n\nOf course, it was four years ago when a good chunk of the Republican Party wasn't for the change Donald Trump was campaigning for.\n\nBut the \"Stop Trump\" movement fizzled because the GOP \u2014 the party of the Bushes and the McCains and the Romneys - was broken.\n\nA \"Stop Warren\" movement, however, can count on a sizable number of Dem voters who still look back fondly on the Obama/Biden years.\n\nAnd here's Warren's challenge, as was evidenced last night: How will she appease that wing of the party?\n\nHow the AOC-Omar endorsements for Bernie are a win-win for the Democratic Party\n\nGiven his recent heart attack, Bernie Sanders had a strong night.\n\nAfter all, not everyone could bounce back from a major health scare and stand on a debate stage for three hours.\n\nTeam Sanders also got a boost when it announced it picked up the endorsements from liberal Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilan Omar, D-Minn.\n\nBut that's not only good news for Sanders; it's also good news for Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and the rest of the Democratic Party - who can now distance themselves from the GOP attacks on AOC and Omar.\n\nAs Ron Brownstein put it, \"If @SenSanders isn't the nominee doesn't this group action make it easier for the ultimate D winner to rebut the Trump charge that they are the candidate of 'the squad' by saying: what do you mean? They endorsed someone else.\"\n\nImpeachment inquiry update\n\nAmbassador Michael McKinley, the former senior adviser to the Secretary of State Pompeo, is expected to appear in closed session today, NBC's Geoff Bennett and Garrett Haake report.\n\nYesterday, House Speaker Nancy said the full House of Representatives won't vote to formalize the impeachment inquiry at this point, reiterating her argument that there is \"no requirement\" for there to be a floor vote for the inquiry to continue.\n\n\"We're not here to call bluffs,\" Pelosi added. \"We're here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States. This is not a game for us. This is deadly serious.\"\n\n2020 Vision: Breaking down the 3rd quarter numbers\n\nThe official numbers for the third fundraising quarter are in after last night's FEC filing deadline:\n\nTotal raised (not including transfers or candidate loans/contributions)\n\nSanders: $25,425,463\n\nWarren: $24,684,963\n\nButtigieg: $19,211,493\n\nBiden: $15,741,432\n\nHarris: $11,849,290\n\nYang: $9,922,625\n\nBooker: $6,023,097\n\nKlobuchar: $4,806,133\n\nO'Rourke: $4,482,284\n\nCastro: $3,497,251\n\nWilliamson: $3,054,167\n\nGabbard: $3,032,159\n\nBullock: $2,299,449\n\nBennet: $2,115,098\n\nSteyer: $2,047,432\n\nDelaney: $468,452\n\nRyan: $425,731\n\nCash on hand as of Sept. 30\n\nSanders: $33,734,560\n\nWarren: $25,717,674\n\nButtigieg: $23,378,518\n\nHarris: $10,542,692\n\nBiden: $8,987,628\n\nYang: $6,357,361\n\nBooker: $4,223,789\n\nKlobuchar: $3,679,592\n\nO'Rourke: $3,255,730\n\nSteyer: $2,623,142\n\nGabbard: $2,138,491\n\nBennet: $1,863,600\n\nBullock: $1,366,143\n\nWilliamson: $723,731\n\nCastro: $672,334\n\nDelaney: $548,061\n\nRyan: $158,348.92\n\nOn the campaign trail today\n\nThe day after the debate, Joe Biden makes a stop in Columbus, Ohio before attending a community event in Davenport, Iowa\u2026 Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris also are in the Hawkeye State, with Buttigieg holding a town hall in Ames and Harris holding one in Dubuque\u2026 And Amy Klobuchar stumps in New Hampshire.\n\nDispatches from NBC's embeds\n\nNBC's Amanda Golden and Julia Jester paint the scene from last night's post-debate spin room, where the candidates and campaign surrogates spoke with reporters.\n\nBeto O'Rourke on his fight with Pete Buttigieg over O'Rourke's mandatory buyback program: \"Either [Buttigieg is] missing the point or he's being driven by the polling on this,\" O'Rourke said, \"When he described the pursuit of a mandatory buyback to take these 16 million AR 15s and AK 47s off the streets as chasing a shiny object, I thought it was so offensive to everyone who has survived gun violence, lost someone to gun violence or fears gun violence in their lives right now.\"\n\nKamala Harris' back-and-forth with Elizabeth Warren last night surprisingly didn't have to do with health care or foreign policy, but over Harris wanting Warren to join her call for Twitter to shut down President Trump's account. Harris said in the spin room, \"The words of the president of the United States, unedited, that are used in that way, have a real impact on real human life. And we are talking about a private corporation that has terms of service, and it is a real simple claim \u2014 he has violated the terms of service and he has violated the privilege that he has to be on a commercial, private platform and that right should be removed.\"\n\nData Download: The number of the day is \u2026 $40,958,012\n\n$40,958,012.\n\nThat's the amount raised by Trump's re-election campaign in the third quarter, per NBC's Monica Alba.\n\nAccording to its latest FEC filings, the campaign spent a little less than $15 million in the same amount of time and ended the quarter with $83 million cash on hand.\n\nThose totals are just what was raised by Trump's official Donald J.
