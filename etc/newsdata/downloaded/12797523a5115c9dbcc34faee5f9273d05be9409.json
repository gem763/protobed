Doing so would save lives and provide better protection for communities.\"\n\nBut the Government said it \"has no plans to decriminalise drug possession\".\n\nA Home Office spokesman added: \"The decriminalisation of drug possession in the UK would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence and the misery that this can cause to families and communities.\u201d", "description": "MPs have called for an expansion of drugs \u201cshooting galleries\u201d alongside the decriminalisation of narcotics for personal use.", "authors": ["Henry Bodkin", "Health Correspondent", "Charlotte Runcie", "Jan Etherington", "Philip Johnston", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212710122-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
