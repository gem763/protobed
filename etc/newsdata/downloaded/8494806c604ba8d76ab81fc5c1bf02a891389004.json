The president is simultaneously battling to prevent his longtime lender Deutsche Bank from turning over his returns and other financial records, and he is also suing to prevent Neal from tapping a recently passed New York law that would allow him to see Trump\u2019s state filings upon request.\n\nIn yet another suit, Trump is fighting a California law requiring him to produce his returns in order to appear on the state\u2019s primary ballot.\n\nIn the filing Friday, Trump\u2019s lawyers ticked off a number of other reasons why Neal\u2019s bid for the president\u2019s returns ought to be tossed out.\n\nThey argued that while the 1924 statute cited by Democrats stipulates the Treasury Department \u201cshall\u201d turn over any returns requested by the chairs of the tax committees, it does not include an enforcement mechanism explaining what happens if someone ignores the law.\n\nThey contend Neal\u2019s suit was not properly authorized by the House because the entire chamber did not vote to allow it to go forward. And they argue that lawmakers do not have the power to sue in court to enforce a subpoena against the executive branch, though Congress has done that before on relatively rare occasions.\n\n\u201cThere is no constitutional or statutory basis for a Committee of the House of Representatives to take on the role of enforcing its subpoenas in the Federal courts where the Executive Branch has decided not to do so,\u201d the filing says.", "description": "In a filing this evening, they argued the court doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction over the matter, contending the dispute ought to be settled between Congress and the White House.", "authors": ["Brian Faler"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b4/f4/109d0497450785200da9ec990da8/190906-donald-trump2-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
