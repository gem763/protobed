Unfortunately, the company has also tied this refresh rate to the brightness level of the display on the Pixel 4. Reddit users have discovered that the Pixel 4 will drop to a 60Hz refresh rate once the display brightness dips below 75 percent. The Verge has confirmed this on a Pixel 4 review unit, and it means that you\u2019re only getting the full 90Hz display rate when the brightness level is high.\n\nThis is fine for outdoors use, but the majority of indoor use will mean the brightness level will likely be 75 percent or lower. It\u2019s not clear why Google has chosen the 75 percent mark, but droidlife has discovered you can head into the developer settings and force the 90Hz setting to always be enabled regardless of brightness levels. This will likely impact the battery life, which is something you\u2019ll want to consider before forcing the 90Hz display to always-on.\n\nOther 90Hz OLED Android phones like the OnePlus 7T keep the display running at its max 90Hz all of the time, but Google has stated it will automatically switch the display refresh rate on the Pixel 4 \u201cfor some content.\u201d We\u2019ve reached out to Google for more information on how and why it limits the Pixel 4 display refresh rate, and we\u2019ll update you accordingly.", "description": "Google is limiting the 90Hz display on its new Pixel 4 to 60Hz unless the brightness level is high. You\u2019ll need to run a screen brightness of 75 percent or greater to get 90Hz, or force the setting to stay on in a developer menu", "authors": ["Tom Warren", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/myki4mnC3yj8xr6b-hI7KVwfn70=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19282487/vpavic_191010_3730_0084.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
