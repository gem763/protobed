Smart medicine cabinets track supplies. Deep sea wind farms repair themselves, remotely.\n\nWelcome to fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). By 2024, there will be 4.1 billion cellular IoT connections, according to the Ericsson Mobility Report of June 2019.\n\nThe 5G networks would be a cornerstone to leverage these devices in different industries from smart cities to smart cars.\n\nYet, as the IoT grows with the arrival of 5G networks \u2014 as for any emerging technology and new development \u2014 there is a need to put even stronger emphasis on security. Cloud-based networking may be subjected to unauthorized access, data leaks, side-channel attacks, and more.\n\nIn foresight, Concordia University has partnered with Ericsson and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to create a new Industry Research Chair in Software-Defined Networking and Network Functions Virtualization (SDN/NFV) Security.\n\nValued at $1.8 million over five years, the new chair in the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science brings together industry and academia: graduate students, professors, industrial researchers and subject matter experts to proactively strengthen cybersecurity for the networks of the future. Their aim is to develop novel processes, techniques and technologies for compliance-driven monitoring, attack prevention, detection and mitigation solutions.\n\n\u201cConcordia is taking the lead in cybersecurity research, and that includes providing the Canadian telecommunications industry with innovative solutions to counteract costly cyberattacks,\u201d says Christophe Guy, vice-president of research and graduate studies at Concordia. \u201cThis partnership with Ericsson and NSERC will generate transferable knowledge and technologies to strengthen the national critical infrastructure that society depends on today.\u201d\n\nMeet the team\n\nThe chairholder is Lingyu Wang, professor at the Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering (CIISE).\n\nHe notes that 5G comes amid increasing tension between privacy awareness, regulation and security threats (e.g. supply chain attacks).\n\n\u201cAs the IoT grows in tandem with emerging 5G technology, it\u2019s crucial to assure the security and stability \u2014 peace of mind \u2014 of both physical and virtual infrastructures across our increasingly networked world,\u201d says Wang. \u201cTo that end, I\u2019m honoured to partner with Ericsson for our research on SDN/NFV security. We aim to strengthen Canada\u2019s leadership in innovation and creating high-skilled workers in such a strategically important area.\u201d\n\nMourad Debbabi is collaborating with Wang on this initiative. He\u2019s the holder of the NSERC/Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec/Thales Senior Industrial Research Chair in Smart Grid Security.\n\n\u201cThe numbers reflect Concordia\u2019s strategic commitment to cybersecurity,\u201d says Debbabi, associate dean of research and graduate studies at the Gina Cody School. \u201cThe Concordia Computer Security Laboratory now has a total of 65 cybersecurity researchers, including 10 professors, 55 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows making strides in prevention, detection, mitigation and recovery methods.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the new NSERC chair program will enable Concordia to make impactful and lasting contributions to the field of SDN/NFV security.\n\nWang and Debbabi work closely with cryptography expert Amr Youssef, professor and graduate program director at the CIISE, and Chadi Assi, a network optimization expert and professor at the institute. External professors also include Suryadipta Majumdar from the State University of New York at Albany and Yuan Hong from the Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\n\u201cTogether, the team is looking to create new models for improving our understanding of the threat landscape and defending the SDN/NFV-based virtual infrastructures,\u201d says Wang.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing interesting challenges about scalability \u2014 secure verification in cloud-sized environments \u2014 and realtimeness, privacy, automation and trust of third-party components.\u201d\n\nEnter Ericsson\n\nSince 2007, Concordia and Ericsson have been collaborating on several research projects around software security and cloud computing security. The industrial research chair extends that collaboration by bringing real-world use cases from industry to academic research to be addressed with innovative cutting-edge solutions.\n\nEva Fogelstr\u00f6m, director of security at Ericsson Research, highly values the continued collaboration with Concordia.\n\n\u201cWith the increased focus on cybersecurity in general, and on security assurance in particular, it\u2019s vital that we pursue research in new advanced methods and solutions for compliance and monitoring,\u201d says Fogelstr\u00f6m. \u201cWe are truly motivated to continue and strengthen our collaboration with the leading researchers at Concordia University to generate state-of-the-art results that will help build the trustworthiness of future mobile networks.\u201d\n\nFor Wang and the entire team, 5G is coming \u2014 fast \u2014 and experts need to get ahead of it.\n\n\u201cOur work with the new chair will help the economy by easing concerns in adopting virtual infrastructure.\u201d\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191025005327/en/\n\nContacts\n\nFiona Downey\n\nSenior Advisor, Public Affairs and Deputy Spokesperson\n\nConcordia University\n\nTel.: 514 848-2424, ext. 2518\n\nCell: 514-518-3336\n\ntwitter.com/fiodow\n\nconcordia.ca/mediarelations", "description": "The university partners with Ericsson and NSERC to create the first Industrial Research Chair in Software-Defined Networking and Network Functions Virtualization SecurityMONTREAL \u2014 Ambulance drones hover over accident sites.
