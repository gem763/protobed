On the contrary \u2013 they has delivered various comments on the lawsuit, showing the difference of opinions and general divisiveness on this issue.\n\nOne of the people to notice this is Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, CEO of Ava Labs, which created the decentralized services platform Ava, who said that the \u201cCryptotwitter is fiercely divided on Tether,\u201d with some believing USDT is \u201cthe key ingredient of repeated pump-and-dumps,\u201d and others that it\u2019s \u201can accurate and semi-transparent reflection of natural market forces.\u201d In the same Twitter thread, he said that this is \u201ca monumental lawsuit against Tether-based manipulation of cryptocurrency prices,\u201d led by an \u201cabsolutely top notch\u201d law firm. As a reminder, the five plaintiffs are represented by law firm Roche Freedman, which worked on the (in)famous Craig Wright case.\n\nWhatever the case might be and however the court might find the outcome, this suit will bring an unprecedented level of transparency to Tether. That's something that almost everyone will agree is a good thing for the whole space. \u2014 Emin G\u00fcn Sirer (@el33th4xor) October 7, 2019\n\nOn the other hand, Gabor Gurbacs, Director of Digital Asset Strategy at an investment management firm VanEck, tweeted that he\u2019s \u201ctired of hoodwink academics, hype-media and uninformed lawyers discrediting the hard work & structural innovation that Tether and Bitfinex built,\u201d adding that the two built services for bitcoin and crypto companies not provided by others. \u201cStop the witch-hunt; protect innovation,\u201d he said.\n\nI don\u2019t know and it isn\u2019t my business, so I can\u2019t answer your question. Tether customers probably read their contracts when they signed it and used the asset. Again I don\u2019t know but good question. \u2014 Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) October 7, 2019\n\nEnh. Not every business is under investigation for fraud after allegedly covering up an $850 million loss caused by close ties to a \"payment processor\" whose principals have been indicted for federal crimes. Like it or not, Tether & Bitfinex have serious issues to account for. \u2014 Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) October 7, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, in his daily commentary, Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, stressed that in major financial institutions across the globe, the process of creating unbacked currency for the purpose of purchasing financial assets and propping-up market prices is simply known as common practice.\n\n\"So if anyone is worried that the price of bitcoin has been 'pumped' please take a moment to think about the effects of a full decade of ample quantitative easing and other liquidity injections multiplied by the fractional reserve system and how this might've affected the value of stocks and bonds,\" the analyst said.\n\nOthers believe that the suit should be dismissed altogether.\n\nHmm. I think I've found the problem.\n\n\n\nThis is not tether. This is copy-coin speculation\n\n\n\nYour clients were speculating with no value thesis and the market took their money.\n\n\n\nAs it does to the ignorant and greedy.\n\n\n\nThis suit should be summarily dismissed. pic.twitter.com/MFdVAi6Iht \u2014 James Lackland (@james_lackland) October 7, 2019\n\nAnd then there are those who don\u2019t necessarily believe in absolutes, and that if the one side is right, doesn\u2019t mean the other was wrong.\n\ndoesn\u2019t have to be one side or the other thing...it\u2019s possible to believe both (1) what they built was innovative and needed at the time AND (2) some super sketchy questionable things are now coming to light about their processes \u2014 Jamie Hinz (@jayhinz) October 7, 2019\n\nAll that said, the crypto market seems not to have paid any particular attention the lawsuit, and we are yet to see how, if at all, it will affect both the USDT, and the two companies themselves. But this is not the first time that crypto market ignored somewhat negative news concerning Tether. Just this May, we reported that the lawyers have confirmed the token is not backed 100% by cash reserves, arguing that it\u2019s not obliged to back its token 1:1 with fiat. What did the market thought of that?
