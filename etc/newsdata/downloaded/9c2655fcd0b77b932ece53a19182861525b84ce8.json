The iconic persona of the 67-year-old fast-food chain has lived on in various forms, though, including in a series of ads since 2015 starring a rotating cast of celebrities.\n\nMore youthful and fit than ever, he now stars in a new videogame released Tuesday that invites players to try to win his heart.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nIn \u201cI Love You, Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin\u2019 Good Dating Simulator,\u201d made by New York and Los Angeles studio Psyop Inc., the Colonel is a lanky cartoon chef who could pass for a millennial hipster. Players answer a series of questions that determine their fate as they navigate a virtual kitchen in hopes of impressing him with their chicken-frying savvy.\n\nThe project targets fans of both anime and dating simulations, said Jarrod Higgins, creative director of KFC\u2019s advertising agency, Wieden+Kennedy. In April, KFC introduced a computer-generated, chiseled male model inspired by the poultry pitchman in a series of campy Instagram photos.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely strayed from the original recipe here,\u201d said Adriane Pontecorvo, a 29-year-old radio DJ in Bloomington, Ind., of the chef\u2019s new, sexy persona. \u201cI\u2019m very into it.\u201d\n\nOthers aren\u2019t amused. Dianne Klein, who worked at a KFC restaurant in Fair Oaks, Calif., as a teenager in the 1970s, can\u2019t stomach the notion of dating any version of the Colonel. The eatery, at the time, had a large, plastic statue of the elderly entrepreneur outside its doors that reminded her of Santa Claus, she said.\n\n\u201cObviously this is not my demo they\u2019re going after,\u201d said Ms. Klein, chief of staff at the University of California\u2019s investment arm.\n\nThe Colonel isn\u2019t the only mascot to age in reverse. In 2012, Quaker Oats gave its venerable Quaker man \u201cLarry\u201d a shorter haircut and more exposed shoulders to look burlier, though not sexy. Procter & Gamble Co. \u2019s Mr. Clean and Georgia-Pacific\u2019s Brawny man have also had makeovers to help those brands appeal to younger consumers.\n\nNailing down the right new look can be challenging. In the early 2000s, Leo Burnett executives spent months studying a refresh of Pillsbury Co.\u2019s famous doughboy Poppin\u2019 Fresh, said Cheryl Berman, former chairman and creative chief at the ad agency, a unit of Publicis Groupe SA . They considered giving the mascot a girlfriend, as well as making him larger and more agile, among other possibilities. Ultimately no changes were made to the decades-old pudgy brand ambassador, Ms. Berman said.\n\n\u201cResearch said don\u2019t touch him, so we freshened and evolved his stories, but not him,\u201d said Ms. Berman, now head of Chicago creative firm Unbundled LLC.\n\nThe stakes are high. Many people weren\u2019t lovin\u2019 it when McDonald\u2019s Co. gave Ronald McDonald a hip, urban look with cargo pants and a red jacket in 2014. Critics took to social media, calling the iconic clown \u201cRonald McDouche,\u201d for example, while Esquire at the time said the new look resembled a \u201cserial killer\u2019s church outfit.\u201d\n\nRolling out new versions of the Colonel is serious business for a chain that is trying to maintain sales growth, while battling competitors like Chick-fil-A Inc. and Restaurant Brands Inc.\u2019s Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. In various ad campaigns over the years, the pitchman has been played by celebrities such as actors Reba McEntire and Ray Liotta.\n\n\u201cOur strategy has been to find new, interesting and provocative ways to make the Colonel a part of pop culture,\u201d said Andrea Zahumensky, marketing chief for KFC U.S., part of Yum Brands Inc., in a statement. \u201cHe\u2019s always our north star.\u201d\n\nUsing videogames and social media to reach consumers is a popular method for advertisers since more people, especially younger audiences, are watching less traditional television and aren\u2019t exposed as much to TV commercials, said Allen Adamson, co-founder of Metaforce LLC, a New York marketing agency. But it isn\u2019t a guaranteed recipe for success.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t always a direct correlation between getting noticed and selling a product,\u201d Mr. Adamson said. \u201cThe question remains, will they sell an extra bucket of chicken or not?\u201d\n\nTyler LeBeau, a 31-year-old IT worker from Chicago who also wrestles and regularly plays videogames, said KFC\u2019s new dating game isn\u2019t appealing. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t spark my fryer,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Sarah E.
