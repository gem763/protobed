The #1 rule at Lusher is to \u2018Be Kind\u2019 and we live this motto every day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cChick-Fil-A has been politically outspoken about its views, and we feel it is not part of Lusher\u2019s culture of kindness and community.\u201d\n\nReports said Friday\u2019s catered lunch was supposed to be provided by the College Football Playoff Foundation (CFPF), but once Corbett informed the organization of his decision, a spokesperson for the CFPF said food from another restaurant would be served.\n\n\u201c[We are just] glad teachers will have a good lunch tomorrow,\u201d spokesperson Tony Fay commented.\n\nOn Thursday, WDSU reporter Travers Mackel tweeted a video of Corbett speaking about his decision to refuse the free lunch:\n\nIn #Nola @LusherPride (Lusher Charter School) is declining free lunches for staff on Friday because the meals are from @ChickfilA and the school wants to be \u2018sensitive to the LGBTQ \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 community\u2019 \u2013 Principal Steven Corbett \ud83d\udc47\n\nMore on this @wdsu at 4/5/6. pic.twitter.com/lbEKr1oAeF \u2014 Travers Mackel (@TraversWDSU) October 10, 2019\n\n\u201cWe felt that, you know, anytime there\u2019s an organization that is anti-LGBTQ and has efforts to infringe upon their rights, we thought it was important to make sure that we were supporting and standing up for our community at that time,\u201d Corbett said.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, a Chick-fil-A spokesperson said the restaurant\u2019s top priority is making everyone feel welcome.\n\n\u201cWe are a restaurant company focused on food and hospitality and have no political or social agenda. Our priority is on providing a welcoming and respectful environment for our guests and Team Members,\u201d the statement concluded.\n\nOn September 20, Breitbart News reported the fast-food outlet had doubled its sales despite protests against the restaurant in cities across the country.\n\n\u201cNow, Chick-fil-A is the third-largest fast-food chain after only Starbucks and McDonalds. There are only 2,400 Chick-fil-A restaurants compared to more than 14,000 Starbucks locations,\u201d the report said, adding that \u201cIn a 2018 survey, Americans teenagers ranked the chicken-based franchise as their favorite fast-food chain, stealing the top spot from Starbucks.\u201d", "description": "A principal in New Orleans, Louisiana, opted out of a free Chick-fil-A lunch for his teachers to avoid offending his LGBTQ staff members.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/lunch-pack-Chick-fil-A-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
