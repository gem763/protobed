It\u2019s about time,\u201d Maldonado, 25, told TODAY as she was holding her son at the hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond words. I can\u2019t describe it.\u201d\n\nJa\u2019bari seems really happy when she holds him, making contented cooing noises, she added. He can finally wear onesies and socks, though he still can\u2019t wear bottoms because of an IV in his legs.\n\nThe baby has spent his entire life so far in the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\nThere were serious doubts whether the boy would survive, but he has grown from 3 pounds at birth to almost 18 pounds now and seems to be living up to his name, which means \u201cfighter\u201d or \u201cvaliant\u201d in Swahili.\n\nJa'bari had to be covered in dressings after birth to keep his body protected and moisturized. Courtesy Priscilla Maldonado\n\nJa\u2019bari was born in San Antonio, Texas, on Jan. 1, 2019, via an emergency cesarean section at 37 weeks into Maldonado\u2019s pregnancy. An ultrasound showed he wasn't gaining weight and his heart rate was dropping.\n\nMaldonado, who has two other children, remembers it was eerily quiet during the delivery and she didn't hear a baby cry.\n\nWhen she was finally able to get a glimpse of the boy in the NICU later that day, Ja\u2019bari was covered in dressings to keep his body protected and moisturized. He had skin on his head, face and parts of his legs, but it was missing in many other places on his body, including his chest, back, shoulders and arms.\n\n\u201cIt was just red. Bright red,\u201d Maldonado recalled of seeing his uncovered flesh when she talked with TODAY in July. \u201cYou could see all his veins (through it), everything was exposed.\u201d\n\nHe required a breathing tube, pain medication and complex care. His eyes were fused shut and, over time, his chin fused to his chest.\n\nDoctors in San Antonio wanted to disconnect him from life support, Maldonado said, but she fought to have him transferred to another facility. Texas Children\u2019s Hospital in Houston was the only one that would take him, she noted.\n\nJa\u2019bari has been there since April. In May, special skin grafts were applied to the baby\u2019s body. The sheets of skin were grown by a biopharmaceutical company in Massachusetts, the San Antonio Express-News reported. Cells from a biopsy of skin behind the baby\u2019s ear were sent to the company and then grown in a lab, Maldonado said. Doctors then covered his neck, chest, back and right arm with the grafts.\n\n\u201cThey used 12 trays (of skin),\u201d she noted.\n\nPriscilla Maldonado holds her son Ja'bari Gray. She was only able to do that a couple of times before he healed from skin graft surgery. Courtesy Priscilla Maldonado\n\nThe surgery was a success and Ja\u2019bari is now 100% covered with skin, Maldonado said. He\u2019s been off pain medications for almost a month and has been breathing on his own since his breathing tube was removed three weeks ago. He continues to be fed via a gastrostomy tube in his stomach.\n\nJa\u2019bari is currently listed in fair condition, said Lindsey Fox, a spokeswoman for Texas Children's Hospital, which declined to make a doctor available for an interview. A multidisciplinary team of experts has been working together to care for Ja\u2019bari Gray\u2019s complex needs, the hospital said in an earlier statement.\n\nThe baby\u2019s condition is called aplasia cutis, a term that simply describes the absence of skin, but doctors still don\u2019t know what caused it, Maldonado said.\n\nJa'bari will be released from the hospital on Oct. 27, his mom said. He now weighs almost 18 pounds. Courtesy of Priscilla Maldonado\n\nJa\u2019bari will have to have more surgeries on his arms, his right hand and right foot. His eyelids have fused shut again after two surgeries to open them, so they may require another procedure. But Maldonado is more optimistic about his recovery now and preparing her Houston home for Ja\u2019bari\u2019s arrival later this month. He\u2019ll need a special stroller, crib, bathtub and car seat.\n\n\u201cIt feels like having a baby all over again \u2014 actually being able to take the baby home,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dream come true, finally.\u201d", "description": "Ja\u2019bari Gray, a baby born without skin in Texas, is healing well after skin graft surgery and will be released from the hospital in October, his mom says.", "authors": ["A.
