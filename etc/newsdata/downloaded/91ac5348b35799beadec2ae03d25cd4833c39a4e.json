Prograis had a cut above his eye and was bleeding heavily from the nose. The American fighter did not attend the post-event press conference and instead went to a local hospital for routine checks, Business Insider was told.\n\nBut though Taylor was awarded the win, becoming a millionaire many times over, it was the teak-tough Scotsman who appeared to have the worst injury.\n\nTaylor's eye had swollen shut during the fight and by the time he addressed the media after midnight, it had completely blackened.\n\nSee Taylor's eye below:\n\nTaylor's eye. Business Insider / Alan Dawson\n\n\"It was pretty easy, a walk in the park \u2026 I could have gone another 12 rounds,\" Taylor said at a press conference which Business Insider attended.\n\n\"The face says it all. It was a hard fight. I got caught with the head, head clashes,\" he said.\n\n\"From round eight I could hardly see from this eye because of all this swelling. I started getting caught with left hands because I could hardly see anything coming.\n\n\"The last two rounds was fighting on instinct with one eye, really. All tactics went out the window, just heart and determination.\"\n\nRegardless, Taylor did not seem too perturbed at the swelling, and was all-smiles while surrounded by the championship belts and the Muhammad Ali trophy he won on the night by beating Prograis in a memorable battle.\n\nTaylor was all smiles. Business Insider / Alan Dawson\n\nWith the win, Taylor moved his flawless record to 16 wins (12 knockouts) and remains unbeaten.\n\nRead more:\n\nA journalist was told to 'act like a normal guy' after pressing Conor McGregor on the sexual assault allegations that have been made against him\n\nConor McGregor linked with comeback bouts against 4 fighters only weeks after being considered an 'irrelevant' has-been\n\nIreland's next top boxer has a rare shot at retribution after losing at the Olympics because of a 'fixed' fight: 'It's personal for my career, my legacy'\n\nA one-armed athlete returns to Bellator MMA and says he is 'ready to make a statement' in his lightweight fight on Saturday\n\nFormer WWE superstar Jake Hager laughs in the faces of people who think former pro wrestlers can't fight MMA", "description": "British fighter Josh Taylor defeated Regis Prograis in London to become the unified super lightweight champion and World Boxing Super Series winner.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db550eedee0193543324c42?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
