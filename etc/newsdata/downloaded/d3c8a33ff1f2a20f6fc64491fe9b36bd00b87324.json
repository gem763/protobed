It\u2019s authentic, and the public knows it. Viewers have seen the exact sequence of events play out in front of their eyes. That\u2019s where the anticipation comes from.\n\nIt\u2019s not a sparring session from 10 years ago behind closed doors. It\u2019s not a callout behind a keyboard, which may or may not have been tweeted by a manager. It\u2019s real life playing out in ways that couldn\u2019t possibly be scripted.\n\nThe \u201ceye poke heard \u2019round the world\u201d had a domino effect \u2013 that much is clear. The errant finger led to controversy, which led to a fiery post-fight scrum and a subsequent hotel altercation.\n\nTwenty-seven days later, Rodriguez (12-2 MMA, 7-1 UFC) and Stephens (28-16 MMA, 15-15 UFC) will step into the cage again in the co-main event of UFC on ESPN 6. The event takes place Friday at TD Garden in Boston and airs on ESPN2.\n\nDuring an open workout held at the famous Peter Welch\u2019s Gym on Tuesday, both men worked out in front of a gathered crowd of UFC fans and media who showed up to watch. After doing a hand-eye coordination drill with a tennis ball on a string, Rodriguez thrilled onlookers with spinning kicks of all varieties. Many fighters decided to cruise through the open workouts, but not Stephens, who threw absolute haymakers for the duration of his workout.\n\nWhen it came time to speak with the media, Rodriguez was up first. Surprisingly, \u201cEl Pantera\u201d said his anger towards Stephens has passed.\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Rodriguez asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to let go. After meditating a lot and reading books and passing times with myself and friends and talking to my family and stuff, I got to the realization that it is what it is.\n\n\u201c\u2026 If you\u2019re living in the past, you\u2019re depressed. If you\u2019re living in the future, you have anxiety. If you\u2019re in the present moment, you\u2019re happy. All I\u2019m doing is focusing on this right here right now, and this is the only thing that we have.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side of the coin, Stephens\u2019s vintage charged behavior was in full force. While he indicated he was sick of talking about the eye poke, he let his disdain for Rodriguez be known loud and clear.\n\nAt the conclusion of his workout, Stephens stepped through the ropes of the boxing ring and let out a deep scream: \u2018(Expletive) Yair,\u2019 which echoed throughout the gym. The crowd went nuts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling good,\u201d Stephens told the media post-workout. \u201cCool as a cucumber. Calm like bomb. I\u2019m ready to go off. I\u2019m going to kill this kid. If he don\u2019t die, it doesn\u2019t count. That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d\n\nTheir outlooks differ on the future, as well as the past. Each 145-pound contender gave his perspective on the hotel run-in from Mexico City, eventually diverging into different takes.\n\nRodriguez claimed he respectfully approached Stephens only to be ignored. \u201cEl Pantera\u201d said he didn\u2019t mean any harm by follow-up questions but received a shove for his efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, Stephens saw things differently. \u201cLil\u2019 Heathen\u201d took a shot at Rodriguez, as well as his family, which could elevate the ever-increasingly personal rivalry to new heights.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to conduct myself like that, but when you\u2019re coming up and provoking me,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cI thought he was trying to be cool, say \u2018Hey, let\u2019s run it back, no problem.\u2019 Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the situation. Notice when I hit him, his eyes changed.\n\n\u201cIf that was my family, and my family was around, and somebody pushed me, cops are going to have to be calling my family like, \u2018Hey, you have some charges coming up.\u2019 Ain\u2019t nobody is going to push me like that, bro. He just proved his whole family was (expletive) made.\u201d\n\nDespite his efforts to suppress his contempt, Rodriguez let off a spark every time Stephens\u2019 name was mentioned. He still doubts the eye poke should have ended the fight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only who knows that answer,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBut from my point of view, the situation really overwhelmed him a little bit. What I think is that he could continue, but I\u2019m not him. \u2026 We\u2019re fighters. We\u2019re here to fight, but if you go back and see body language, he never attempted to fight again.\n\n\u201cWhenever you have an eye poke or whatever, or something hurts, you\u2019re praying to go back in there as soon as possible. You\u2019re not going to let more time run. What was happening was a lot of time was running. It kind of was weird for me in the moment.\u201d\n\nAt one point in his scrum, Stephens interjected a reporter\u2019s question with \u201cthe eye (thing) is over, bro.\u201d\n\nThat statement is accurate in the sense that Stephens\u2019 injury is in the rear-view, but it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been put to rest altogether. They\u2019ll lock the door behind them (again) Friday night.", "description": "Featherweight contenders Yair Rodriguez and Jeremy Stephens have that \"it\" factor level of disdain ahead of UFC Boston.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Simon Samano", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/yair-rodriguez-jeremy-stephens-ufc-mexico-city-weigh-ins.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
