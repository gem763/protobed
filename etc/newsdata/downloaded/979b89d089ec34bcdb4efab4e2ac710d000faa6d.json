When they threaten Shiite holy sites, Iraq\u2019s top Shiite cleric issues a call to arms, and masses of volunteers, largely backed and armed by Iran, join militias.\n\n\n\nJune 29 \u2014 The group renames itself the Islamic State and declares the establishment of a self-styled \u201ccaliphate,\u201d a traditional model of Islamic rule, in its territories in Iraq and Syria.
