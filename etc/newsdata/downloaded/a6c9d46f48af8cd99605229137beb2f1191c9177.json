Our pick for the best story game of 2018 is officially doing what its predecessor could not and making the leap to PC. It\u2019s a boon for my non-console-owning brothers and sisters, and now we know why Rockstar has its own PC launcher.\n\nRED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 is coming to PC November 5thhttps://t.co/ECEqNr9HUI pic.twitter.com/8jg8WeVvQ8 \u2014 Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) October 4, 2019\n\nSingle-player mode will come with new bounties, gang hideouts, and weapons, while pre-order bonuses include a new horse and various in-game goodies. I also suspect PC players will have dozens of mods ready to hit the ground running within hours of official release.\n\nAs expected, it\u2019s not just the base game that\u2019s coming to PC, but also Red Dead Online. The burgeoning community of Wild West MMO players, and the number of PC-based players who could be joining in, are probably a bigger incentive than the base game by itself. Users who pre-order via the Rockstar Launcher will also get 50 gold bars as a bonus.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re one of the Steam faithful, you may be slightly disappointed, as that store is once again getting the shaft. According to Rockstar, RDR2 will be available to pre-order from the Epic Store, Humble, Greenman Gaming, GameStop, and \u201cother digital retailers\u201d starting October 23. It\u2019ll also be a launch title for Google\u2019s Stadia, the Founder\u2019s Edition of which is set to come out in November. However, Valve\u2019s platform won\u2019t be getting the game until December.\n\nRockstar is sweetening the pot by offering two free games for anyone who pre-orders RDR2 on the Rockstar Games Launcher by October 22. You have your pick of GTAs III, San Andreas, and Vice City, L.A. Noire, Bully, or Max Payne 3. Considering you can already get a free copy of San Andreas by downloading the launcher within the next few days, you could potentially be getting lots of classic, old-school Rockstar goodness.\n\nI\u2019m honestly surprised Rockstar\u2019s not bringing the first Red Dead onto the Rockstar PC Launcher, piggyback on the sequel. It\u2019d be the perfect excuse. We\u2019ve contacted the company to see if there\u2019s a chance that could happen.\n\nRDR2 releases on PC on November 5. Pre-orders on the Rockstar launcher open on October 9.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 Coming to PC November 5th on Rockstar Games\n\nRead next: An entrepreneur's guide to Boston\u2019s tech ecosystem", "description": "As expected, Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2 is coming to PC on November 5.
