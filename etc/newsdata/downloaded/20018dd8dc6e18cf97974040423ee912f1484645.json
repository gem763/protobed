Not one of them has ever complained about me \u2014 not a single complaint. I\u2019ve employed women in the top capacities, in every capacity, for years, and we\u2019ve always paid them the equal of men.\u201d\n\nHe also defended a 2018 interview in which he declared himself a Me Too \u201cposter boy\u201d because none of the female stars in his movies have accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nAmazon Studios tabled the U.S. release of the movie in 2017 and later severed ties with Allen, dropping a four-film distribution deal. In a court filing in April, studio lawyers argued that the writer-director\u2019s comments dismissing Me Too in 2017 and his repeated denials of Farrow\u2019s allegation gave them no choice, \u201ceffectively sabotaging\u201d the release of his film \u201cWonder Wheel\u201d that year.\n\nAt the time, Allen expressed sympathy for disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who is accused of sexually abusing scores of female actors and employees. He also accused Farrow of using the Me Too movement for personal gain, and called it \u201ca witch-hunt atmosphere\u201d that threatened \u201cevery guy in an office who winks at a woman.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Farrow criticized Johansson.\n\n\u201cBecause if we\u2019ve learned anything from the past two years it\u2019s that you definitely should believe male predators who \u2018maintain their innocence\u2019 without question,\u201d Farrow tweeted. \u201cScarlett has a long way to go in understanding the issue she claims to champion.\u201d\n\nBecause if we\u2019ve learned anything from the past two years it\u2019s that you definitely should believe male predators who \u201cmaintain their innocence\u201d without question.
