California was the first state to make it legally available for medicinal purposes and one of the first to make recreational use legal. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that Los Angeles is the home of the country\u2019s first cannabis cafe, Lowell Cafe. It\u2019s owned and operated by Lowell Farms, a brand best known for their packs of pre-roll joints seen at various dispensaries and Hollywood events. It officially opened on Oct. 1 and is the first of eight cannabis cafes set to open in West Hollywood in the next few months. They, and the city, hope to create a model for the next level of cannabis tourism.\n\nTheir website proclaims: \u201cThe end of prohibition is here\u201d\u2014which is the basis of their mission. For decades, marijuana enthusiasts have been forced to partake in the shadows (or in our cars), away from public view as if smoking is shameful. Yet cannabis is the most widely used \u201cdrug\u201d in the world and according to a 2017 study one in seven people in the United States reported using marijuana. Walk through the streets of most American cities and you\u2019ll catch a whiff of the sticky-icky.\n\nLowell Cafe sits on a 20,000 square foot lot on La Brea Ave on the edge of West Hollywood next to a Ralph\u2019s supermarket and across the street from a synagogue. You\u2019ll know you\u2019re in the right place because there\u2019s a massive billboard above the building with an arrow pointing down telling you to \u201cEat, Drink & Smoke...Here!\u201d The space itself consists of an indoor bar area with numerous tables for eating and smoking, and an adjacent outdoor garden patio seating 220 patrons.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Beast Travel Digest Get the entire world in your inbox.

There\u2019s an indoor/outdoor ledge with stools that connects the spaces and keep it airy. The patio has an earthy aesthetic with the wooden booths, vines running along the walls and powerful air vents that look like heat lamps. Trees provide some shade and oxygen along with succulents and desert flowers. It\u2019s a pothead garden tucked away from the bustling traffic of La Brea. And it doesn\u2019t reek of weed on the sidewalk because those fans are working overtime.\n\nSo what to expect when visiting Lowell Cafe? The No. 1 pro-tip is to make reservations. It\u2019s hard to say how long the walk-up wait is but there\u2019s always some sort of line. It could be 20 minutes or an hour-plus. Save yourself the drama and reserve a table online.\n\nOnce you enter, there is someone to check you in so you must have identification which will be scanned. Bringing in your own bongs, pipes, tobacco is prohibited. Visitors must be 21 or older and you\u2019ll see folks of all ages, L.A. natives, tourists, entertainment industry professionals, homegirls hanging out. Weed is a universal unifier. After a quick check-in, there\u2019s a host stand where you give your name and wait for your table. There\u2019s a little outdoor waiting area (not for consumption) or you can wait by the bar and take cute Instagram photos by their neon sign-branded wall.\n\nThe cannabis menu is extensive; you can purchase numerous types of flower or bud (the plant itself), vapes, beverages, edibles and if you really want to go hard, concentrates (oils, waxes or hash that have super-potent THC levels). There\u2019s something for every type of cannabis consumer. Bongs are available for rent, and the cannabis host offers free rolling papers and lighters are plentiful. Though it\u2019s important to note that most of the flower sold comes in pre-rolls or straight-up buds with relatively high THC ratios. For those of us who prefer higher ratio CBD flowers and less paranoia, there\u2019s a pre-roll pack of five marijuana cigarettes from Caliva that have only 8 percent THC so you can still get a buzz without freaking out. Just be sure to safely consume especially because there\u2019s a 90-minute limit on table seating. Consider that when purchasing edibles.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no cannabis-infused food available, the menu was designed to pair well with cannabis in the same way restaurants pair food with wine. There\u2019s a plethora of munchies: jalapeno mac & cheese bites, gooey grilled cheese sandwiches, and a baked alaska ice cream concoction. If you\u2019re super hungry (and you probably will be), there\u2019s jerk lamp chops, sticky tamarind wings, burgers with fries, and hefty salads. Vegan options are also plentiful including the (delicious) vegan nachos, cauliflower banh mi and black bean burger, which caught my eye. But instead I had the pork banh mi and it was juicy and properly seasoned. Because it\u2019s a cannabis cafe, their appetizers are made for stoners. A popular and highly recommended favorite is the \u201cStreet Corn,\u201d a heaping bowl of corn, bacon, cojita cheese, Corn Pops, and Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos. I\u2019ll admit I was hesitant about it but after that joint it was heavenly.\n\nBecause of legal issues in California, you pay for the cannabis and the food separately. The owners had to split the business in two: one as a restaurant and one as a \u201ccannabis retail establishment.\u201d This means there is an outdoor cafe that only serves food and beverages (including alcohol) but when you\u2019re in the indoor restaurant and garden patio, you\u2019re essentially ordering food from the adjacent restaurant. A smart workaround. So you\u2019ll have a waitress who brings you food and non-cannabis drinks, and a flower host who specifically brings you the herb. Both were super attentive and knowledgeable, making helpful food and cannabis recommendations especially if you\u2019re a marijuana novice.\n\nThe only major quirk is that visitors can\u2019t access the bathroom directly from the cafe. You have to exit the restaurant and walk around to the back of the building. It\u2019s definitely a logistical inconvenience but at least the bathrooms have funky decor. The walls are covered in a collage of celebrities and cultural icons who are famous for their love of weed. Smoky images of Bob Marley, Rihanna, Snoop, Cheech and Chong, and John Lennon exhaling are plastered above the toilets maintaining the vibe.\n\nLowell Cafe is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily so you can wake and bake, create your own happy hour, or come for a nightcap. Its biggest selling point is the novelty of being able to smoke your weed in peace at a restaurant or cafe. However, in places like California and arguably all over the globe, folks smoke everywhere: beaches, parks, parties, backyard BBQs. But there\u2019s a particular freedom to being in community with a bunch of cannabis lovers enjoying bud in public without fear.\n\nLowell Cafe, 1201 North La Brea Avenue, West Hollywood, California 90038\n\nOpen daily 10 a.m.-10 p.m.", "description": "America\u2019s first cannabis cafe, a place where you can get high and eat at the same time, has opened in L.A.
