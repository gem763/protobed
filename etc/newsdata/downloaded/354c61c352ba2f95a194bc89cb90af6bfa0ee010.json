Entertainment/Trailer image via YouTube)\n\nTodd Phillips\u2019s depressed loner is nothing like a role model.\n\nAfter John Lennon was shot, the film director Robert Altman\u2019s phone rang.\n\n\u201cI get a call immediately from the Washington Post,\u201d Altman later recalled, \u201cand they said, \u2018Do you feel responsible for this?\u2019 And I said, \u2018What do you mean responsible?\u2019 \u2018Well, I mean you\u2019re the one that predicted there would be a political assassination of a star.\u2019\u201d Five years earlier, Altman\u2019s film Nashville had reached a climax when a country singer was shot at a political rally. Nashville; it turned out, had nothing to do with the warped thinking of Lennon\u2019s killer, Mark David Chapman, who modeled himself after Holden Caulfield and thought Lennon was a phony and a hypocrite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, Joker director Todd Phillips has been pre-blamed for any violence that may be associated with his film, and it seems likely that if any domestic dispute happens to turn violent within 500 yards of any movie theater in America, Phillips will be tied to it. There is a strangely political tone to the discussion about this film: left-wing critics seem to be attacking it for reasons that seem to miss the point of the movie, and some on the right appear to be excited simply because so many on the left are condemning it. Commenters on a recent Deadline.com story about Joker are saying things like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got tix for this evening, because anytime a movie gives the finger to the woke brigade, we\u2019re going to support it!\u201d and \u201ca great needed f**k you to PC culture.\u201d\n\nJoaquin Phoenix\u2019s depressed loser, Arthur Fleck, according to left-wing film critics, comes off far too well in the film, which \u201clionizes and glamorizes Arthur . . . the patron saint of incels . . . a mess, but we\u2019re also supposed to think he\u2019s kind of great\u201d (Time). Joker is \u201can attempt to elevate nerdy revenge to the plane of myth. That\u2019s scary\u201d (Slate). It\u2019s \u201cdangerous . . . an incel training manual . . . could be validation for violent glory seekers\u201d (Vox). Jacobin ties Joker to Ronald Reagan, who became president in 1981, the year Joker is set (\u201cIn portraying a performer whose affable act masks deep resentment and violence, Phillips\u2019s movie reminds us that long before Trump, it was Ronald Reagan who first used television to launch a mass, reactionary social movement.\u201d). That Reagan was shot that same year by a warped loner much like Fleck seems not to register with Jacobin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn The New Yorker, Anthony Lane calls out Joker as merely \u201ca product\u201d that is bound to stir discussion \u201cwith ticket sales to match,\u201d as if all movies don\u2019t hope to sell lots of tickets. Lane calls foul on the use of Gary Glitter\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll, Part 2\u201d in one scene because \u201cGlitter was convicted, in 1999, of possessing child pornography, and, seven years later, of sexually abusing minors,\u201d which means the song choice is therefore \u201ccrafted to offend.\u201d Is any use of a Michael Jackson song in a movie also calculated to give offense? I don\u2019t think Phillips picked the song because of Glitter\u2019s crimes but because it\u2019s disturbingly ironic in situ. The Guardian, to my surprise, comes off level-headed in the discussion, running a review by Christina Newland expressing puzzlement with descriptions of the film as \u201cright-wing.\u201d \u201cWith severe cuts to mental health services affecting Arthur\u2019s stability, along with Phillips\u2019s focus on the ominous effects of widespread gun ownership,\u201d she writes, \u201cit seems odd that it\u2019s being hailed as wholly rightwing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense to argue both that Joker lionizes the title character and that it\u2019s right-wing. He leads a revolution of the greasepaint underclass against the 1 percenters, channeling the eat-the-rich mindset of Bane and Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises. If he\u2019s the hero, and we\u2019re cheering for him, then we must take some satisfaction in seeing his clown proletariat rise up. That isn\u2019t right-wing or conservative, that\u2019s positively Jacobinic. To the extent Joker is right-wing, it\u2019s because the title figure is a wicked man who does terrible things, including attacking Wall Street types, and we\u2019re meant to be disgusted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich is another way of saying Joker is simply an anti-hero, albeit a complicated one. Complicated characters are more interesting, as critics usually agree. Yet so much terrible media coverage is attached to this film that Warner Bros. felt obligated to put out the following statement: \u201cIt is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\u201d This ought to be obvious. Arthur Fleck is a creep, a loser, and a psycho. He is meant to freeze your marrow, not inspire you to follow him. Nobody in his right mind looks at this diseased character and thinks, \u201cRole model.\u201d Nor is the movie \u201cempathetic\u201d toward Joker (the New York Times). The audience isn\u2019t meant to feel what he feels. We can marvel at the character study of a twisted soul without having the slightest desire to be like the anti-hero it depicts. The film is \u201ca way to sneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic book film,\u201d as Phillips told The Wrap.\n\nThe Left seems to be stirred up about Joker because it thinks that there are armies of alt-right incels out there ready to strike, awaiting a movie to tell them it\u2019s okay. While it\u2019s understandable that people worry about mass public shootings these days, psychotic killers by definition don\u2019t think in linear, logical ways. As Phoenix put it in an interview with IGN, \u201cIf you have somebody that has that level of emotional disturbance, they can find fuel anywhere.\u201d Even in the most notorious case of real-life violence being linked to movie murder, the reasoning is cracked. In Taxi Driver, a psycho stalks a presidential candidate with intent to murder him, slinks away because security looks threatening, then decides to murder a pimp and others responsible for the degradation of a child prostitute. In a game of psychotic telephone, this got distorted into a call to shoot President Reagan in order to impress the actress who had played the prostitute in the movie. Should we hold Martin Scorsese liable for this psychotic logic, and if so, where does this end? From Bonnie and Clyde on, portraying killers as fun, sexy, devilishly charming rogues has been a staple of pop culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here are two movies that don\u2019t make their protagonists look good: Taxi Driver and Joker. Travis Bickle and Arthur Fleck are wretched, foul human beings, not someone any non-crazy person would try to emulate. That Phoenix and Phillips tell the Joker\u2019s story from deep within his wretchedness and pain (instead of from Batman\u2019s point of view) doesn\u2019t differ conceptually from Richard III. In both cases, that the audience can grasp the suffering of the anti-hero is a mark of success on the part of the artist. But in both cases that figure is also obviously a monster.", "description": "The Left seems to be stirred up about Joker because it thinks that there are armies of alt-right incels out there ready to strike, awaiting a movie to tell them it\u2019s okay.", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Andrew C.
