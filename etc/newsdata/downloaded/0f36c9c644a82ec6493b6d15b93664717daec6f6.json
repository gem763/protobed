He must urgently ensure that his government addresses the ongoing ethnic tensions that threaten instability and further human rights abuses. He should also ensure that his government revises the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation which continues to be used as a tool of repression, and holds suspected perpetrators of past human rights violations to account.\"\n\nIn Ethiopia, even if much work remains, Abiy Ahmed has initiated important reforms that give many citizens hope for a better life and a brighter future. Berit Reiss-Andersen, Nobel Peace Prize Committee Chair\n\nSpeculation\n\nThere had been speculation about the winner in the run-up to the ceremony, with suggested winners including 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg; German Chancellor Angela Merkel; and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.\n\nSince 1901, 99 Nobel Peace Prizes have been handed out to individuals and 24 organisations. While the other prizes are announced in Stockholm, the peace prize is awarded in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.\n\nThis week, 12 Nobel laureates have been named, of whom 11 are men.\n\n191010183645296\n\nTwo literature prizes were awarded on Thursday - one for 2018 that went to Polish novelist Olga Tokarczuk and one for 2019 that was given to Austrian author Peter Handke.\n\nThe chemistry prize went to three scientists for their work leading to the development of lithium-ion batteries; the physics award was given to a Canadian-American and two Swiss academics for exploring the evolution of the universe and discovering a new kind of planet; and the physiology or medicine award went to two Americans and one British scientist for discovering details of how the body's cells sense and react to low oxygen levels.\n\nIn his will, Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite, decided the peace prize should be awarded in Oslo. His exact reasons for having an institution in Norway handing out that prize is unclear, but during his lifetime Sweden and Norway were joined in a union, which was dissolved in 1905.\n\nThe economics prize was not created by Nobel, but by Sweden's central bank in 1968. It is awarded on Monday.\n\nWith the glory comes a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award, a gold medal and a diploma. Even though the peace prize is awarded in Norway, the amount is denominated in Swedish kronor.\n\nThe laureates receive them at elegant ceremonies on December 10 - the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896 - in Stockholm and Oslo.", "description": "Abiy Ahmed Ali worked for peace with Eritrea, has overseen democratic reforms and mediated in regional disputes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/90dfc1ab3f074e65a3d21ff7694ef177_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
