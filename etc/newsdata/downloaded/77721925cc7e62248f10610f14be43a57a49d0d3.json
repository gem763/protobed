I hope that\u2019s the case,\u201d Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday when asked about the planned vote.\n\nThe House announced Monday that it will move Thursday to determine whether to establish impeachment inquiry procedures into President Trump. The text of the resolution was not immediately released, but House Rule Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-MA) said it would \u201cprovide a clear path forward\u201d on the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThis is the right thing to do for the institution and the American people,\u201d said McGovern.\n\nPelosi stated in a letter Monday that the resolution was not legally necessary but the House decided to take the vote \u201cto eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nHere is @SpeakerPelosi\u2019s letter to colleagues announcing vote this week on resolution that affirms ongoing impeachment inquiry and authorizes making hearings, deposition transcripts, etc public pic.twitter.com/NSGM8GpAPE \u2014 Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) October 28, 2019\n\n\u201cFor weeks the president, his counsel in the White House and his allies in Congress have made the baseless claim that the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry \u2018lacks the necessary authorization for a valise impeachment proceeding.\u2019 They argue that, because the House has not taken a vote, they may simply pretend the impeachment inquiry does not exist,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe resolution will establish procedure for open hearings, authorize the release of deposition transcripts and outline how the Intelligence Community can transfer evidence to the House judiciary committee, Pelosi said.\n\nPelosi\u2019s announcement came after weeks of pressure on House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) from Republicans to bring the impeachment probe out from the shadows.\n\nSchiff\u2019s House intel panel has interviewed various current and former Trump administration officials inside Capitol Hill\u2019s SCIF room, known as a sensitive compartmented information facility. Republicans argue Schiff has no basis to use the secret bunker for interviews and have accused the California Democrat and his colleagues of selectively leaking excerpts of witnesses\u2019 testimony to the media. Last Wednesday, roughly 30 House Republicans attempted to storm the chamber as Laura Cooper, a top Department of Defense official, was scheduled to testify.\n\n\u201cBehind those doors they intend to overturn the results of an American presidential election. We want to know what is going on,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who led the group of Republicans, said at a press conference prior to attempting to enter the secured room.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) have introduced a resolution condemning the Democrats\u2019 secret impeachment. The measure has 50 Republican cosponsors. Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) do not support it.\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "House Majority Whip Steny\u00a0Hoyer\u00a0on Tuesday would not guarantee that the House Democrats will vote on formalizing their impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181503622-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
