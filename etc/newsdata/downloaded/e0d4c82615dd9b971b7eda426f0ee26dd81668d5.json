He said \"we are in the midst of a historic tragedy.\"\n\nAfter making landfall in Abaco on Sunday, the hurricane's movement slowed until it was \"nearly stationary\" Monday as it thrashed Grand Bahama Island, the National Weather Service said. Although the storm was downgraded to a Category 4, the forecaster said Dorian is \"still very much an extremely dangerous storm.\"\n\nEarlier winds had reached as much as 220 miles per hour, matching the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever to make landfall, according to the Associated Press. Maximum sustained winds weakened to 145 mph by Monday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said. Dorian is expected to pummel the island until Tuesday morning. Earlier, the forecaster said the hurricane was \"causing extreme destruction,\" with storm surges 18 to 23 feet above normal levels.\n\nVideos shared from the Bahamas showed waves surging across the airport in Freeport, Bahamas. Furniture floated in houses inundated with water.\n\nCars sat mostly submerged as wind whipped around them, and some locals navigated streets in boats, according to images and videos shared by state-owned broadcaster ZNS Bahamas.\n\n\"From all accounts we have received catastrophic damage,\" Foreign Minister Darren Henfield told ZNS. \"We have reports of casualties, we have reports of bodies being seen. We cannot confirm those reports until we go out and have a look for ourselves.\"\n\nHenfield was speaking from Abaco, where the International Red Cross estimates nearly 13,000 homes may have been severely damaged or destroyed. The group said fresh water will become an important need due to the contimination from saltwater as a result of the extensive flooding.\n\nThe storm was about 105 miles (170 km) east of West Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday at 5 p.m. EDT \u2014 roughly where it was hours earlier. The outer bands of the storm are forecast to begin reaching the Florida coast by Monday, before turning and heading northward along the coastline. The NHC cautioned about \"life-threatening flash floods\" as the hurricane made its way up the coastline.\n\nResidents of parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina evacuated as they prepared for the storm's approach. The states' governors ordered at least a million people to evacuate starting Monday, according to NBC News.\n\nGeorgia's government estimates the mandatory evacuation orders affect 400,000 people in the state. The orders focus on six coastal counties in Georgia.", "description": "The powerful Category 4 storm all but halted Monday afternoon as it pounded the northwestern Bahamas and the southeastern U.S. braced for bruising winds and rain.", "authors": ["Jacob Pramuk Jeff Cox", "Jacob Pramuk", "Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106107882-1567452251200gettyimages-1165708934.jpeg?v=1567452365"}
