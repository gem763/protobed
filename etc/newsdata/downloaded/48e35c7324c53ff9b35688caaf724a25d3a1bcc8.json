I never want to hear Boris Johnson or any other Brexiteer say again that the European Union is undemocratic.\u201d\n\nThe chair of the Bundestag\u2019s foreign affairs committee, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, who is a senior member of Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party, expressed his satisfaction at the judgment.\n\nPlay Video Reaction as supreme court rules Boris Johnson's proroguing of parliament was unlawful \u2013 watch live\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not my place to comment on judicial proceedings in Britain. But as a fellow MP I do feel the need to express my joy and solidarity with British parliamentarians.\u201d\n\nPhilippe Lamberts, the co-leader of the Greens in the European parliament, said: \u201cThe decision confirms what we already knew about Boris Johnson. That he will spare no tricks to get what he wants. He is an ample opportunist. But I look at Jeremy Corbyn and I see a lot of opportunism there as well.\u201d\n\nA former head of the EU council\u2019s legal service, Jean-Claude Piris, tweeted: \u201cIt gives me good and emotional feelings too.\n\n\u201cIt was so sad to see this great country at the risk of being led to no longer respect the principles and values upon which its democratic institutions have been built over centuries.\u201d\n\nSources said the impact on the talks in Brussels was not clear, although there was a consensus that it made it less likely Johnson would be able to force through a no-deal Brexit on 31 October now that parliament had further opportunities to act.\n\nThe prime minister is seemingly constrained by the Benn bill, which would instruct him to seek an extension if a deal is not agreed with the EU and backed by the Commons, but Johnson had suggested he would find a way around the law.\n\nPlay Video 1:34 Boris Johnson: supreme court has made getting Brexit deal harder \u2013 video\n\nOne EU diplomat said: \u201cAnother domestic in this long Brexit saga. Parliament hasn\u2019t been able to formulate a position in the last three years so why would they suddenly now?\n\n\u201cWithout decisive action their government is driving this process off the cliff. But seeing as Brexit was about the sovereignty of parliament it was bewildering that government moved to suspend it. So much about this process is contradictory and utterly mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nFabian Zuleeg, the chief executive of the European Policy Centre thinktank, tweeted: \u201cConclusions? 31 October no deal unlikely unless BJ is willing to break law and won\u2019t be stopped.\n\n\u201cSo Boris Johnson only has two real options: resign and fight election on clear no deal stance or make deal, capitulating in negotiations. Former looks more likely but unlikely to bring resolution.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the ruling threw doubt on Johnson\u2019s credibility in the negotiating room, a spokeswoman for the European commission said: \u201cWe have all seen the news but it is not for us to comment on the internal constitutional matters of the United Kingdom. Our interlocutor is the United Kingdom government and that remains the case. All other judgments I leave to you.\u201d", "description": "Senior politicians welcome supreme court decision as reassurance of rule of law in UK", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/823b10515f08d75a96e7ff81505ef906baa27dff/0_0_4894_2936/master/4894.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c4b0ca9f161b2810375518474d0c7896", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
