Trump's Gotta Go.' George Conway Ramps Up Call To Oust President.", "language": "en", "text": "After a lengthy, carefully reasoned argument about why \u201cpathological narcissist\u201d Donald Trump must be removed from the White House, conservative lawyer George Conway tweeted urgently later Thursday: \u201cThis is insane. Trump\u2019s gotta go.\u201d\n\nThis is insane. Trump\u2019s gotta go. https://t.co/3nSgVPNSZ3 \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) October 3, 2019\n\nTrump also told reporters Thursday that China should investigate Biden.\n\nConway\u2019s \u201cinsane\u201d label for what has been transpiring with Trump followed a treatise Thursday in The Atlantic that Trump is unfit for office because he\u2019s an extreme \u201cnarcissist\u201d who puts himself ahead of the nation.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a mental health professional to see something\u2019s seriously off with Trump,\u201d Conway wrote. And it\u2019s only getting worse under the stress of a stumbling economy and an impeachment investigation, he warned.\n\n\u201cNo president in recent memory \u2014 and likely no president ever \u2014 has prompted more discussion about his mental stability and connection with reality,\u201d Conway wrote. He recounted several troubling reports since Trump took office, including former White House chief of staff John Kelly allegedly calling Trump \u201cunhinged\u201d and an anonymous White House official writing of the president\u2019s \u201cinstability\u201d in The New York Times.\n\nThe president is \u201cvolatile and erratic\u201d \u2014 and \u201cincapable of consistently telling the truth,\u201d George Conway wrote. He quoted Times columnist Megan McArdle: \u201cThis is not normal. And I don\u2019t mean that as in, \u2018Trump is violating the shibboleths of the Washington establishment.\u2019 I mean that as in, \u2018This is not normal for a functioning adult.\u2019\u201d\n\nA president should act as a \u201cfiduciary\u201d of the nation, who pursues the \u201c\u2019public interest in good faith republican fashion rather than pursuing his self-interest,\u2019\u201d Conway noted, quoting from a recent Harvard Review article.\n\nBut Trump acts instead like an extreme \u2014 if not \u201cpathological\u201d \u2014 narcissist who is convinced he is an exceptional human being and an expert on everything, despite evidence to the contrary, lacks empathy, and craves being the constant focus of admiration, Conway argued. The \u201cfundamental life goal\u201d of an extreme narcissist \u201cis to promote the greatness of the self, for all to see,\u201d psychologist Dan McAdams has written in The Atlantic, Conway noted.\n\n\u201cSimply put, Trump\u2019s ingrained and extreme behavioral characteristics make it impossible for him to carry out the duties of the presidency in the way the Constitution requires,\u201d Conway argued.\n\n\u201cIt would take entire books to catalog all of Trump\u2019s behavioral abnormalities and try to explain them .... But when you line up what the Framers expected of a president with all that we know about Donald Trump, his unfitness becomes obvious,\u201d Conway wrote.\n\n\u201cTo act as a fiduciary requires you to put someone else\u2019s interests above your own, and Trump\u2019s personality makes it impossible for him to do that,\u201d Conway concluded.\n\n\u201cFor Trump, Trump always comes first. He places his interests over everyone else\u2019s \u2014 including those of the nation whose laws he swore to faithfully execute. That\u2019s not consistent with the duties of the president.\u201d\n\nThe answer to the Trump problem, Conway concluded, is impeachment.\n\n\u201cIf Congress does its job and presents the evidence, those who are in denial\u201d about Trump \u201cwon\u2019t be able to ignore the problem any longer,\u201d he explained. \u201cNot only because of the evidence itself, but because Donald Trump will respond in pathological ways \u2014 and in doing so, he\u2019ll prove the points against him in ways almost no one will be able to ignore.\u201d", "description": "Kellyanne Conway's husband lays out long argument for Trump's removal, then learns of his bombshell call asking Chinese president to launch Biden probe.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d96ac112000004e004c2e1b.jpeg?cache=yc5oqjk4ze&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
