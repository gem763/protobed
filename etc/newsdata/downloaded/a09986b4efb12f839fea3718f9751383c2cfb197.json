While both men support the idea of a unity deal, they have disagreed over who should lead it.\n\nNetanyahu wants his traditional religious and nationalist allies to sit with Likud and Blue and White.\n\nGantz is not keen to form a government with Netanyahu's hardline allies. He also refuses to serve under a Netanyahu-led government while the long-serving leader faces possible indictment for corruption charges.\n\nIsrael's attorney general is to decide on whether to charge Netanyahu in the coming weeks.\n\nIt is the first time in more than a decade that a candidate other than Netanyahu has been given the opportunity to form a government.\n\nBut without Likud, Gantz's options are limited. He can try to break up Netanyahu's right-wing bloc and win over smaller hardline parties. So far, there is no sign of that happening.\n\nHis remaining potential partners include a diverse group of parties that have little in common, including the secular ultranationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, dovish Jewish parties and a grouping of Arab parties, which have never sat in a government before.\n\nThe country has faced political paralysis since Yisrael Beitenu leader Avigdor Lieberman refused to sit in a government with Netanyahu's ultra-religious partners following April's election. That decision robbed Netanyahu of a parliamentary majority, leading to last month's inconclusive election.\n\nLieberman has refused to endorse either candidate for prime minister and demands they reach a unity deal. If the sides fail, Israel could face a third election early next year.", "description": "Political rivals open new round of unity talks in a bid to avoid third parliamentary poll in less than a year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/17/cd6964cf4b0c477492ed924b2bf7576b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
