Such a ruling would open the border gates to about 45,000 people, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe three-judge panel didn\u2019t decide whether to uphold a judge\u2019s ruling to block the \u201cforced return\u201d policy, as the ACLU asked, but it expressed concern why the government doesn\u2019t ask immigrants whether they had any fears about being sent back to Mexico. It\u2019s standard practice for asylum seekers to be asked if they are fearful of returning to their home countries.\n\nThe appeals court previously has allowed the policy to remain in effect during the litigation -- which the ACLU says is endangering the tens of thousands of people.\n\n\u201cIndividuals returned to Mexico are sent to areas with some of the highest murder rates in the world,\u201d the ACLU said in a court filing. \u201cThey face extreme dangers -- killings, kidnappings, sexual assault, robbery, and other forms of violence -- from cartels, the gangs they fled their home countries to escape, corrupt government officials, and an anti-migrant sentiment.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is one of the many fronts on which immigrant rights\u2019 advocates have been battling the administration\u2019s efforts to block entry to the swelling number of migrants from Central American countries.\n\nThe government also is trying to stop people from applying for asylum in the U.S. if they didn\u2019t make such an application in another country on their way to the U.S. -- so a person from El Salvador should have applied for asylum in Guatemala, or Mexico, according to the U.S.\n\nIn another case the appeals court heard Tuesday, the U.S. is seeking to overturn a judge\u2019s decision that found it was illegal to require asylum seekers to apply only at official border crossings.\n\nAn appeals panel in December rejected the government\u2019s request to put the judge\u2019s ruling on hold while the case was tried. The panel said it was likely the rule was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nThe cases are: East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 18-17274, and Innovation Law Lab v. McAleenan, 19-15716, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth District (San Francisco).\n\n(Updates with hearing in second paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Edvard Pettersson in Los Angeles at epettersson@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Peter Blumberg, Steve Stroth\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Central Americans seeking asylum in the U.S. said they\u2019ve waited long enough in Mexico for their applications to be assessed under a Trump administration policy they call unlawful.On Tuesday, their advocates asked the federal appeals court in San Francisco to rule that the policy is illegal", "authors": ["Edvard Pettersson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xXrmb9MA.emant4ybMcfjg--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/c5e3cc042ed7de5b1994c4d7bbf2de28", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
