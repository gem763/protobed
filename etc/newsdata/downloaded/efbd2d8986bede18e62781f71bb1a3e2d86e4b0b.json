The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) presents one such problem, and despite the loss of its physical caliphate early this year and the significant losses it suffered on the battlefield, the next manifestation of this threat now lies in a remote corner of northeast Syria.\n\nJaved Ali\n\nMarcella L. Huber\n\nAn estimated 70,000 women and children remain detained by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in a small 1.5 square mile complex called the al-Hol camp. Within this population, t here are thousands who appear to remain deeply committed to the group's ideology, to include a large number from the West. Without further attention from the United States and the international community, it is likely that a significant portion of these individuals will be further radicalized and committed to the ISIS cause, and could be an important driver to the group's recovery in face of several setbacks.\n\nAs national security professionals with careers in the military and counterterrorism communities respectively, we feel now is a crucial moment for the United States to demonstrate global leadership and develop a clear strategy to deal with this complex issue. The humanitarian crisis plaguing the overcrowded camp that was intended to hold 10,000, is coupled with a national security concern that warrants increased diplomatic, judicial, counterterrorism, and intelligence collaboration from the international community. The SDF does not have the capability to manage this large pool of people and there is no clear plan to address their repatriation or rehabilitation.\n\nThe Trump administration's National Security Strategy explicitly prioritizes countering threats such as the one looming at al-Hol, and now is the time to put a plan into action to demonstrate US commitment since currently very little is being done.\n\nIf the United States could establish a line of authority to the camp, policy stakeholders would include Departments of State and Defense for establishing diplomatic will and physical security of the camp, together with the Department of Justice to establish precedence in the prosecution of individuals affiliated with ISIS, and the Department of Homeland Security to ensure US-bound ISIS affiliates uphold repatriation agreements. The US State Department's Defeat ISIS Coalition framework could effectively marshal international partner support to encourage repatriation, reintegration, and rehabilitation support. Congressional appropriations would be crucial to the success of any policy directed to the camp.", "description": "As the world marks the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Javed Ali and Marcella Huber say it's crucial for the US to implement a strategy to curb the next manifestation of the ISIS threat in Syria.", "authors": ["Opinion Javed Ali", "Marcella Huber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190910064622-04-syria-al-hol-isis-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
