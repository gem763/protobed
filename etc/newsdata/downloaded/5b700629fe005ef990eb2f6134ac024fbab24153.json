FOREX-Dollar erases post-Fed bounce, sterling up on Brexit deal hopes\n\n* Dollar gives up gains against most major currencies\n\n* Sterling hits two-month high on Brexit deal hopes\n\n* Aussie, kiwi near multi-week lows\n\n* Chinese rate easing eyed\n\nBy Tom Westbrook\n\nSINGAPORE, Sept 20 (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses\n\nagainst most major currencies on Friday, as central banks in\n\nSwitzerland and the UK refrained from following the Federal\n\nReserve in cutting rates, while risk appetite ebbed on caution\n\nabout U.S-China trade talks.\n\nSterling hit a two-month high of $1.2560 against the\n\ngreenback overnight after European Commission President\n\nJean-Claude Juncker said he thought Brussels could reach a deal\n\nwith Britain to leave the European Union. The Swiss National Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of\n\nJapan all kept their policies on hold on Thursday. Their\n\ncurrencies rose and mostly held gains in Asian trade.\n\nThe exception was the Antipodes, where the Australian and\n\nNew Zealand dollars languished around two-week lows after a slew\n\nof soft data capped by an uptick in Australian unemployment that\n\nprompted a rush to price in fresh rate cuts for October.\n\n\"Both the Aussie and kiwi have underperformed this week and\n\nI blame the Aussies for that one,\" said Jason Wong, senior\n\nmarket strategist at BNZ in Wellington.\n\n\"The unemployment rate ticking up yesterday has fuelled\n\nexpectations that the (Reserve Bank of Australia) is going to\n\ncut next month as opposed to November, and the kiwi's been in\n\nthat downdraft.\"\n\nThe Australian dollar AUD=D3 held at $0.6793 in morning\n\ntrade, close to its lowest since Sept. 4, while the New Zealand\n\ndollar NZD=D3 hit $0.6297, its weakest since Sept. 3.\n\nEconomists at Citi on Friday joined Australia's major banks\n\nin predicting an October rate cut. The dollar was steady buying 108.00 Japanese yen ,\n\nafter falling from close to a seven-week peak hit on Thursday.\n\nIt was slightly weaker against the Swiss franc at\n\n0.9921 per dollar and the euro at $1.1050 and flat against a\n\nbasket of currencies at 98.334.\n\nInvestors are also focused on U.S.-China trade talks in\n\nWashington, aimed at laying the groundwork for high-level\n\ndiscussions next month.\n\nHowever, most traders are cautious. Few signs of progress\n\nhave emerged and with a wide gulf between both sides remaining,\n\nit is weighing on the recent risk-on mood. \"If you look at the Aussie dollar or renminbi it's faded,\"\n\nsaid Joe Capurso, senior currency strategist at the Commonwealth\n\nBank of Australia in Sydney.\n\n\"Both of those currencies have weakened in the last three or\n\nfour days,\" he said. \"I think market participants are going to\n\nneed something concrete to really rally...at the moment there's\n\njust not enough.\"\n\nThe Chinese yuan CNH= steadied to just under a one-week\n\nlow at 7.0990 per dollar in offshore trade, with investors\n\neyeing a possible benchmark lending rate reduction later in the\n\nday. China's central bank is trying to guide borrowing costs\n\nlower to help an economy suffering from the trade war.", "description": "FOREX-Dollar erases post-Fed bounce, sterling up on Brexit deal hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA8A0IJ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
