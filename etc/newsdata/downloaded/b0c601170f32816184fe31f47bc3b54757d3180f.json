His rich, incident-filled and (mostly) lucky life is as absorbing to contemplate as his brilliant, manifold art. So it made sense that Bearden, in 1977, was the subject of a New Yorker profile by a master of the form, Calvin Tomkins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBearden appears to have liked the profile. But the relationship between words and pictures is perennially uneasy and writers, especially good writers, often spur artists\u2019 competitive instincts. Having his life story narrated in a magazine prompted Bearden to try telling it himself in a series of collages and paintings that he called, with a nod to the New Yorker, \u201cProfile.\u201d\n\nBearden worked on the series between 1978 and 1981. He divided it into two parts. Both focused on episodes from his early years, which Tomkins\u2019s elegant narrative had skated over. The first part concentrates on his childhood in the South and in Pittsburgh (where he went to live, intermittently, with his grandmother); the second focuses on Harlem in the 1930s. Both parts are on display at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta in a show called \u201cSomething Over Something Else.\u201d\n\nYou could come away assuming that Bearden grew up in poverty both in the rural South and around the steel mills of Pittsburgh. In fact, although he witnessed these worlds during extended stays, the reality was more complicated. As Bearden\u2019s friend Charles Alston said, \u201cRomy was never a poor kid. He was straight out of the middle class, and the urban middle class at that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe High show\u2019s title is taken from Bearden\u2019s words: \u201cI really think the art of painting is the art of putting something over something else.\u201d The statement, which Tomkins quotes in his profile, speaks to Bearden\u2019s favored idiom of collage \u2014 the layering of one thing over another. And it points to his specific achievement: More than any artist I can think of, Bearden pulled collage away from its associations with modernist fragmentation and precious fussiness into something loose and capacious, yoked to storytelling, pulsing and rippling with all the layers of life.\n\nBut the phrase also carries a whiff of trickery and masquerade \u2014 \u201cputting something over on someone.\u201d Bearden was a sophisticated storyteller \u2014 he relished the idea of the \u201cunreliable narrator\u201d \u2014 so he surely intended both associations.\n\nSeeing the show, reading Tomkins\u2019s profile and poring over a new anthology, \u201cThe Romare Bearden Reader\u201d \u2014 which includes a useful introduction by Robert O\u2019Meally, and essays and reflections by Morrison, Ellison, August Wilson, Tomkins (the profile) and Bearden \u2014 renewed my love of this artist, who died of bone cancer complications in 1988.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cProfile\u201d collages have slyly suggestive captions. \u201cThe Daybreak Express\u201d shows a bedroom with a nude woman stretched out on her stomach. Behind her is a window through which we see a train puffing steam. The inscription reads: \u201cYou could tell not only what train it was but also who the engineer was by the sound of the whistle.\u201d\n\nOn its own, the image has an all-at-once clarity that makes verbal description feel labored. (I didn\u2019t tell you, for instance, that the woman\u2019s head rests in the crook of her elbow, nor that one eye looks out at the viewer, nor what kind of room it is, nor whether it is night or day outside; yet when you look at the picture, it takes just a second to register all of that.)\n\nStill, words can do things that images can\u2019t. The inscription, with its double entendre and pungent specificity (were the horn-tooting habits of the train engineers really so distinct?) has a poetic concision that goes beyond the scope of images.\n\nThroughout the series, Bearden sets up echoes, not only visually (women, windows and trains are repeating motifs) but verbally. \u201cThe last time I saw Liza was down at the station when I left for Pittsburgh on the 5.13,\u201d reads one inscription. Another says: \u201cSometimes at night I used to dream of being the one who was running the train.\u201d And a third: \u201cThe trains in the stories she told always ran North.\u201d\n\nBeyond this roiling interplay between visual and verbal imagery, I love Bearden\u2019s \u201cProfile\u201d series (and his whole oeuvre) for the way it undermines the exhausted premises of 21st century identity politics.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo grasp how, it\u2019s important to say first that Bearden could scarcely have been more engaged with black identity. Everything he made \u2014 most everything he did \u2014 had to do with telling the story of black life in the United States. He fought prejudice and promoted visibility for African Americans at every turn.\n\nBitter experience had taught him how cruel and arbitrary racial distinctions could be. An exceptionally talented pitcher, he had played on a professional \u201ccolored\u201d team while studying in Boston. He was so good that, in 1932, he was invited to join the Philadelphia Athletics, a team that had won the World Series in 1929 and \u201930 and the American League pennant in \u201931. But accepting would have meant pretending he was white. (This was 15 years before Jackie Robinson broke baseball\u2019s color barrier.) Bearden turned it down.\n\nLike his mother, he was an activist. He had started out in art drawing political cartoons for the Afro-American newspaper. In 1963, he helped found a collective of black artists, the Spiral Group. He spent the 1960s organizing ambitious shows devoted to African American art. With Norman Lewis and Ernest Crichlow, he even started the Cinque Gallery, dedicated to black artists.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy then, he had \u201cmade it\u201d as an artist; he wanted to help in every way he could. (\u201cHis phone never stops ringing,\u201d Chris Shelton, the gallery\u2019s first director, commented to Tomkins.)\n\nBearden once said that \u201can artist is an art lover who finds that in all the art that he sees, he sees something missing.\u201d For him, what was missing was the experiences, dreams and projections of his people. Today\u2019s prominent black artists, including Kerry James Marshall, Mickalene Thomas (whose collage aesthetic was heavily influenced by Bearden), Amy Sherald and Kehinde Wiley, are similarly motivated.\n\nCorrecting this became Bearden\u2019s life\u2019s work. He wanted, he said in 1964, to \u201cestablish a world through art in which the validity of my Negro experience could live and make its own logic.\u201d\n\nHe succeeded magnificently, largely because he wasn\u2019t interested in simplifying reality. He would have loathed the idea of depleting the imprint life left on him just to make it fit the requirements of a political worldview. It would have betrayed his understanding of identity itself.\n\n\u201cWe all live in a mask,\u201d he once said. \u201cWe all have a hundred different identities.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the best (and most brightly colored) collages in Part II of \u201cProfile\u201d illustrates this in ways that may be hard for contemporary viewers to wrap their heads around. It shows the black vaudeville mime artist, Johnny Hudgins, outside the Lafayette Theater.\n\nHudgins, who was nicknamed the Wah-Wah Man, often performed in blackface. This was not uncommon for black vaudeville performers (for all that we rightly condemn it now, blackface has a complicated history).\n\n\u201cHe was my favorite of all the comedians,\u201d wrote Bearden in the accompanying inscription. \u201cWhat Johnny Hudgins could do through mime on an empty stage helped show me how worlds were created on an empty canvas.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA black man in blackface is, if nothing else, an \u201cunreliable narrator,\u201d which may have been part of what Bearden loved in Hudgins. In any case, one can imagine how an African American who usually passed for white might have appreciated what Hudgins was up to, and the art he brought to his popular act.\n\nAD\n\nBearden took inspiration wherever he found it: George Grosz, Stuart Davis, Chinese painting, Picasso, Matisse, the Dutch masters, African art, Homer, Derek Walcott, jazz. His broad-mindedness was not just aesthetic. From childhood, he also straddled multiple modes of social existence. He instinctively felt, as Tomkins wrote, that \u201cthe path of separatism within a culture is basically self-defeating.\u201d He also understood that identity \u2014 everyone\u2019s identity \u2014 is layered.\n\nThe words we use today \u2014 \u201cblack,\u201d \u201cwhite,\u201d \u201cLatino,\u201d \u201cAsian\u201d \u2014 may be clear. And, God knows, we all crave clarity. But the reality of selfhood is cloudier, more contradictory and harder to parse than those constricting categories allow. In the end, that is not a misfortune. It is a solace (how hard it is to be one thing!).\n\nAD\n\nArt, too, is a solace. It exists to remind us that we come, all of us, in many versions.\n\n\u201cSomething Over Something Else\u201d: Romare Bearden\u2019s Profile Series at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta through Feb. 2. high.org\n\nRead more by Sebastian Smee:", "description": "Now Bearden, one of the greatest black artists of the 20th century, gets a rare show in Atlanta.", "authors": ["Sebastian Smee", "Art Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LUNOpT1p7nbskChMFudhVcl4nRs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LOJPO2XKA4I6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
