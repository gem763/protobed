This may take a few days,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe deadline for the letter to be sent appeared to be 2300 GMT on Saturday: the law itself referred to 11 p.m. without saying what time zone, but the text of the letter Johnson is meant to send refers to a deadline of 11 p.m. GMT.\n\nGraphic: Understanding Brexit (here)\n\nDEMONSTRATIONS\n\nSaturday\u2019s amendment, put forward by former Conservative cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, deflated Johnson\u2019s big Brexit day just as hundreds of thousands gathered to march on parliament demanding another referendum on EU membership.\n\nAfter several hours of heated debate, senior politicians - including Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom, House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg and Labour\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman Diane Abbott - were escorted from parliament past jeering demonstrators by phalanxes of police.\n\nThe European Commission said Britain must now inform it of its next steps as soon as possible. French President Emmanuel Macron told Johnson a delay was in no-one\u2019s interest, an official at the French presidency told Reuters.\n\nIreland believes granting an extension is preferable to Britain leaving with no deal, but there is no guarantee that view is shared throughout the EU, its foreign minister said.\n\nBut however weary EU leaders are of the long and tortuous road to Brexit, it seems likely that the bloc will grant a delay.\n\nGraphic: Understanding the Irish border (here)\n\nBREXIT DELAY?\n\nIn a move designed to prevent the United Kingdom slipping out of the EU without a deal by design or default, Letwin\u2019s amendment delays parliament\u2019s ultimate decision on Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal until the very end of the process.\n\nBy supporting Letwin, whom Johnson had expelled from the Conservative Party, parliament exposed the prime minister to another law passed by his opponents that called for him to ask for a delay until Jan. 31, 2020 unless he had a deal approved by the end of Saturday.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the House of Commons as parliament discusses Brexit, sitting on a Saturday for the first time since the 1982 Falklands War, in London, Britain, October 19, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video. Parliament TV via REUTERS\n\nEven if he is given an extension that he does not want by the EU, Johnson could still take the country out of the bloc on Oct. 31 because the law allows him to if he can get all the legislation approved by that date.\n\nRees-Mogg said the government now planned to put Johnson\u2019s withdrawal deal to a debate and vote on Monday, but the house speaker John Bercow said he would rule on Monday whether he would allow that.\n\nLetwin said he hoped Johnson\u2019s deal would succeed, but he wanted \u201can insurance policy which prevents the UK from crashing out on 31 October by mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation\u201d.\n\nThree years after the country voted 52%-48% to leave the European project, many Britons say they are bored with the whole Brexit argument and just want the process to end.\n\nBut others demonstrating on Saturday remain angry that Britain is leaving the EU and want that reversed.\n\nHannah Barton, 56, a cider maker from Derbyshire in central England, was draped in the EU flag. \u201cWe feel that we are voiceless. This is a national disaster waiting to happen and it is going to destroy the economy,\u201d she said.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, backed a second referendum, saying \u201cthe people should have the final say\u201d.\n\nProtesters outside parliament cheered as lawmakers backed Letwin\u2019s amendment.\n\n\u2018SUPER SATURDAY\u2019\n\nBrexit \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d topped a frenetic week that saw Johnson confound his opponents by clinching a new Brexit deal with the EU.\n\nWhen it comes to a vote in a divided parliament where he has no majority, Johnson must win the support of 320 lawmakers to pass his deal.\n\nIf he wins, he will go down in history as the leader who delivered a Brexit - for good or bad - that pulls the United Kingdom far out of the EU\u2019s orbit. Should he fail, Johnson will face the humiliation of Brexit unravelling.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nHe says lawmakers face the option of either approving the deal or propelling the United Kingdom to a disorderly no-deal exit that could divide the West, hurt global growth and bring renewed violence to Northern Ireland.\n\nTo win, Johnson must persuade enough Brexit-supporting rebels in both his Conservative Party and the Labour Party to back his deal. His Northern Irish allies and the three main opposition parties oppose it.\n\nGraphic: Brexit\u2019s \u2018Super Saturday\u2019 (here)", "description": "Boris Johnson will send a letter on Saturday requesting a further extension to Britain's departure from the European Union, an EU official said, with the British prime minister obliged to ask for a delay after losing a vote in parliament.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442658766&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I077", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
