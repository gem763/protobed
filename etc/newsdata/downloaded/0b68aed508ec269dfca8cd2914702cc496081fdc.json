I have people that feel sorry for me, but I don't want to be a burden to anybody.\"\n\nShe added that she would be grateful for help to get off the streets and to have a roof over her head and musical instruments.\n\n\"You know why I (sing) in the subway?,\" she said. \"Because it sounds so great.\"\n\nSeveral Twitter users have urged that her talent not go to waste and have reached out to \"America's Got Talent\" and \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" - one of America's top talk shows - to help publicise her story.\n\nSergeant Hector Guzman, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department told the Los Angeles Times that Zamourka's voice had struck a chord with officers.\n\n\"It was powerful the first time we saw it, and every time we see it again, it's still powerful,\" he told the paper, adding that he has watched the video 50 times. \"The message for us was simple: Remind ourselves to take a moment to look around and listen.\"", "description": "A video posted by police of a homeless woman singing opera in the Los Angeles metro has gone viral and prompted calls for her to be on a grand stage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7875/31a7875dd75c4f69a74f3c9ffc5579e8.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
