And it's based on a true story.\n\n\u201cDeep down, [Destiny is] somebody who's really lonely who just wants a friend and she finds this group of friends who are all different,\u201d Wu told ABC News.\n\nIn researching the film, Wu also became friends with a group of women who worked at strip clubs.\n\n\u201c[We] went out to dinner, hung out, and less in like interview format but more just as friends, just to get to know them as people instead of like, \u2018Ooh, what's it like to do this thing?\u2019\u201d Wu explained. \u201cBecause just like anything, it's a job. You know, it's like when people ask, \u2018What's it like being an actor?\u2019 I'm like, \u2018Love it, it's great.\u2019 But it's not the idea of what you think it is.\u201d\n\nWith an all-female core cast and mostly women behind the scenes as well, including writer/director Lorene Scafaria, Wu said being on the \"Hustlers\" set was an empowering experience. Instead of fighting for a seat at the table, everyone was \u201csorta making our own table.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it wasn't competitive,\u201d she added. \u201cIt just felt like a sisterhood and felt like a project where we could all be ourselves.\u201d\n\n\"Hustlers\" hits theaters Friday.", "description": "After a breakout role last year with", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/hustlers-movie-01-ap-jef-190828_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
