To be safe, you could simply turn off the fingerprint scanner in the meantime.\n\nThis week, a Galaxy S10 owner told U.K.-based publication The Sun that her phone could be unlocked by her husband when there's a cheap screen cover protecting the fingerprint sensor.\n\nHer husband's fingerprints were not registered to the device.\n\nGradient Photo Editor:The latest viral app will try to show you your celebrity lookalike\n\nYahoo Groups is shutting down: Act soon or lose all your old photos, message history\n\nThe flagship Galaxy S10 series was launched in March with an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner baked into the display. It provides \"invisible yet vault-like security that keeps your data safe,\" Samsung says.\n\nThe biometric data reader detects \"the 3D ridges and valleys of your unique fingerprint to quickly and accurately recognize you,\" the tech giant said. Fingerprints not only unlock the smartphones, but they can authorize mobile payments via the Samsung Pay system.\n\nThe company said the security vulnerability affects its Galaxy Note10 and 10+ as well as its S10 and S10+ smartphones. The glitch happens when the phone's built-in sensors recognize patterns on silicon screen protectors along with fingerprints, Samsung said.\n\n\"If you currently use front screen protective covers, to ensure optimum fingerprint scanning, please refrain from using this cover until your device has been updated with a new software patch,\" Samsung said.\n\nThe next software update could be ready within a week, the company said.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/18/third-party-screen-protectors-let-unauthorized-users-access-devices/4020762002/", "description": "Plastic screen protectors can trick the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 causing them to unlock for unauthorized users.", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Published A.M.
