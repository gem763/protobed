Whether I\u2019m making brief but steamy eye contact with a very symmetrical stranger at CVS, or getting glared at for bumping someone with my overstuffed tote bag on the bus, it\u2019s usually pretty apparent that I\u2019m being observed, for better or worse.\n\nIn certain scenarios, it can be tougher to parse who\u2019s looking where: on a crowded train, across a packed bar, waiting for coffee during the morning rush at Starbucks, whatever. If you\u2019re unsure if the babe in your general proximity noticed you, too, there\u2019s a little trick that I\u2019ve found to be a semi-reliable indicator of whether I\u2019m being watched: It\u2019s called mirroring, and it\u2019s the closest thing to a flirting \u201clifehack\u201d in my arsenal.\n\nIn a 1999 study, psychologists defined mirroring (also known as \u201cthe chameleon effect\u201d) as \u201cnonconscious mimicry of the postures, mannerisms, facial expressions, and other behaviors of one's interaction partners.\u201d It\u2019s long been touted as a strategy that Successful People can employ strategically to show their engagement during job interviews or at work, because research has shown that intentional mirroring can positively influence the way someone is perceived\u2014although other studies have shown that it\u2019s also possible to go overboard with mirroring and verge into creep territory in the eyes of the person you\u2019re mimicking.\n\nBut you\u2019re not here because you want a job. You\u2019re here because you want to know how to figure out if a hot person is looking at you. The answer is simple: throw out some kind of gesture and see who copies you. I\u2019d recommend something simple, like crossing or uncrossing your legs, scratching your nose, cracking your knuckles, or even looking pointedly in one direction and seeing who follows your gaze to check out what you\u2019re checking out while you\u2019re getting checked out. Not to brag, but I can make a few guys look out of a train window for no reason on a good day, and I\u2019m not above doing it in the interest of getting a little attention.\n\nI\u2019m not pulling this out of thin air, either: A simple Google search for \u2018mirroring flirt\u2019 turns up articles from the likes of BBC Science and Marie Claire that list the behavior as a sign that someone might have seduction on the brain. So why isn\u2019t everyone using mirroring to figure out who\u2019s making eyes at who? I can only conclude that my years of experience analyzing the messages conveyed consciously and unconsciously by the human body (I did theatre in high school) have left me with particularly keen powers of observation that the average person has not had the same chance to hone. I\u2019m basically Mindhunter if Mindhunter was about having charged, nonverbal interactions with guys who wear wallet chains. You\u2019re all welcome to join me and my galaxy brain in 3019; it\u2019s great here!\n\nOf course, once you\u2019ve figured out who\u2019s watching you, it\u2019s kind of up to you (and the watcher) what happens next. Not everybody watches with intent or enjoys getting hit on in public, so I\u2019d recommend making some eye contact with your copycat and reading the room from there\u2014do not use my pseudoscience flirt hack as free license to harass a rando! Because even though we\u2019re almost always being looked at by some unknown individual when we\u2019re out and about, how we\u2019re being perceived is another question entirely.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Katie Way on Twitter .", "description": "Unconscious body language cues can be a sign that someone is interested in you\u2014if you know what to look for.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d97a39af533e80009ab57b3/lede/1570219272993-A-young-transgender-woman-looking-at-her-reflection-in-a-bathroom-mirror.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.843xh;0xw,0.0265xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
