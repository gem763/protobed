It is a sobering gap between the clubs who met in last year\u2019s Champions League final.\n\nYet Pochettino saw enough to enthuse rather than depress him in a high class meeting at Anfield, Mohamed Salah\u2019s second-half penalty the difference after Harry Kane's early strike was cancelled out by Jordan Henderson.\n\n\u201cAfter five and a half years it\u2019s a moment to be all together and show our support,\u201d said Pochettino.\n\n\u201cIn this season we deserve more points on the table. It\u2019s a moment to stay strong, to keep pushing. Of course in a different season this game could have finished two or three nil for us. But today for us it is a different way and we must stay calm and take the best decisions for the future.\u201d", "description": "Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino called on the club to stick together as they fell into the bottom half and saw any hope of a title challenge effectively ended after just ten games.", "authors": ["Chris Bascombe", "Keith Hackett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214323552-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqmZxOu8v4Byvxg8afr28tjNGAHn4JCkxWKebclHDbQZM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
