Whereas products such as smart speakers, T-shirts and footwear mostly side-stepped the first round of tariffs, they weren\u2019t so lucky this time around.\n\nAbout 77% of all shoes, clothes and home textile imports to the U.S. from China now has a tariff attached to it, according to research by the American Apparel and Footwear Association.\n\nKeep in mind there is one more (at least) round of tariffs on these types of consumer products lurking for December 15.\n\nDespite apparel and home goods companies doing their best to assure Wall Street this earnings season they are working hard to mitigate the tariff impact \u2014 by shifting production outside of China and taking price increases \u2014 investors in the space remain very nervous on the bottom line impact. The outcome of the holiday season for many retailers truly hang in the balance on whether they can mitigate tariffs to a material extent (if at all).\n\nReflecting that concern, shares of apparel companies Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Guess (GES), and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) fell 6.2%, 7% and 4%, respectively, on Tuesday.\n\nThe selling pressure extended to the beat-up department store stocks, too, which are obviously havens for racks of apparel and home goods. J.C. Penney\u2019s (JCP) stock plunged 5%, Macy\u2019s (M) lost 3%, and Nordstrom (JWN) shed 3%.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) each lost 5%.\n\nMost of these stocks have been under pressure all year long amid the threat of higher tariffs and spotty traffic to physical stores. And the risk isn\u2019t something being drummed up by Wall Street to trigger selling and open up buying opportunities.\n\n\u2018Tariffs are ultimately attacks on the end consumer\u2019\n\nChinese made clothes are displayed for sale at a Manhattan department store (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) More\n\n\u201cFor most companies, it will take time to materially diversify operations away from China and/or adjust costs. There are long lead times in the production cycle and it can take time to work through potential limitations in apparel and footwear manufacturing capacity in other countries, including quality control checks,\u201d says Moody\u2019s analyst Michael Zuccaro. \u201cAlthough companies may opt to increase prices, it will be difficult to do so. U.S. consumers, saddled with higher costs, would likely cut back on purchases, which would take a bite out of company revenue and profitability.\u201d\n\nCautioned Best Buy (BBY) CEO Corie Barry on an earnings call last week, \"It is hard to predict how at the macro level, consumers will react to higher prices resulting from tariffs.\"\n\nBarry\u2019s sentiment was echoed over at Foot Locker (FL) during its latest earnings call.\n\n\"The tariffs are ultimately attacks on the end consumer and we need to figure that out how to soften that blow for the consumer. On the footwear side, each of those conversations with our vendor partners is a fluid conversation, right. There is a lot of energy in the industry to try to get the footwear piece of the tariffs postponed or pulled out of the next roll out,\u201d said Foot Locker CEO Richard Johnson.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
