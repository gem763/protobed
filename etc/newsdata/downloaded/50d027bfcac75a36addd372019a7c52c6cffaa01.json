So much to tell you \u2013 here goes with trying to boil it down.\n\nThe House of Commons has inflicted a major defeat on Boris Johnson that means MPs will vote on a bill to rule out a no-deal Brexit. MPs will seek to take the bill forward today and our live blog is ready for all the action. Jeremy Corbyn says Labour will not agree to a general election unless the bill is passed. Twenty-one Conservative MPs who stood up to Johnson had the whip withdrawn in retaliation, costing them their Tory electoral candidacy \u2013 among them, Nicholas Soames, 71, grandson of Winston Churchill. Another, Ed Vaizey, said: \u201cWhen you hear those speeches in the House of Commons by Antoinette Sandbach and Ken Clarke, you just know you are on the right side.\u201d David Gauke said it was his first vote against the whip in 14 years as an MP but \u201cif tonight\u2019s motion had been lost, a no-deal Brexit would have been almost inevitable. Probably not a good career move but the right choice.\u201d\n\nThe Commons voted 328-301 to take control of business for the anti-no-deal bill \u2013 but even before that, one Conservative MP, Phillip Lee, quit the party of his own accord and crossed the floor to join the Lib Dems.\n\nPlay Video 0:34 Tory MP Phillip Lee defects to Lib Dems midway through Johnson speech \u2013 video\n\nHis authority shredded, the prime minister said he would move under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act to hold a general election on 15 October. Corbyn insisted: \u201cThere is no consent in this house to leave the European Union without a deal. There is no majority for no deal in the country \u2026 Get the bill through first in order to take no deal off the table.\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, came under fire for lounging sprawled along the government frontbench during one of the most consequential debates in parliamentary history. \u201cHe was sitting bolt upright, however,\u201d writes Kevin Rawlinson, \u201cwhen the tellers returned soon afterwards to deliver the result: MPs had handed his government a crushing defeat in its very first Commons vote.\u201d\n\nMidweek catch-up\n\n> Italy\u2019s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) has voted for a coalition with the centre-left Democratic party (PD) after the far-right League crashed itself out of government. The PM, Giuseppe Conte, is expected to choose his ministers by Friday.\n\n> After devastating Grand Bahama, Hurricane Dorian has begun creeping towards the US coastline. It has been downgraded to category 2 but is still rated a serious threat to northern Florida and the coastal Carolinas.\n\n> The use of stop and search by police has been rising in Northern Ireland since 2005 but results in few arrests, say criminologists at Queen\u2019s University Belfast. Its use in England and Wales fell after Theresa May as home secretary ordered a scaling-down in 2011.\n\n> The chancellor, Sajid Javid, will be something of a sideshow in the Commons today if and when he gets to make his spending round statement, which is expected to commit \u00a32bn more to no-deal Brexit planning, taking the total to more than \u00a38.3bn.\n\n\u2018Grotesque\u2019, a \u2018ticking timebomb\u2019 \u2013 Some of the European reaction to British plans to leave oil rigs abandoned in the North Sea. The government is intending this year to endorse Shell\u2019s plans to leave behind a steel jacket and the concrete bases beneath three of its rigs in the Brent oilfield. The Bravo, Charlie and Delta installations still contain an estimated 11,000 tonnes of raw oil and toxins in their base. Several hundred of the platforms are due to be decommissioned over the next three decades. Germany has issued a formal complaint backed by Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. It will come to a head at a special meeting on 18 October in London of members of Ospar, the international mechanism to protect the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic.\n\n\u2018County lines\u2019 gang guilty \u2013 Seven drug gang members have been found guilty over a \u201ccounty lines\u201d operation that ran thousands of pounds worth of heroin and crack cocaine from London to Cornwall. Vulnerable young Londoners were sent to Bodmin and dumped in the flat of an addict to sell heroin and crack cocaine that was transported into the county in hired Mercedes and Audi saloons. It was broken up by Operation Ligament when 200 police officers held raids across Cornwall and north London this year. The group will be sentenced in October.\n\nSugar-free no guarantee \u2013 People who regularly consume soft drinks have a higher risk of an early death, even if they drink no-sugar varieties, researchers have found. Dr Neil Murphy, a co-author of the research from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, said people should \u201creplace them with other healthier beverages, preferably water\u201d. The authors of the study say it supports public health efforts to reduce consumption of soft drinks, such as the UK\u2019s sugar tax.\n\n\u2018Life-changing treatment\u2019 \u2013 NHS England is to pay for a genetic treatment that will save children with a rare inherited disorder from going blind. The one-off injection of voretigene neparvovec, also known as Luxturna, is for babies born with inherited retinal dystrophies. It normally costs \u00a3613,410 per patient but the NHS has done a deal with Novartis, the UK supplier, and the numbers needing treatment are low. The company estimates that 86 people in England could benefit now, and about three to five babies with the genetic mutation are born every year. \u201cLoss of vision can have devastating effects, particularly for children and young people, but this truly life-changing treatment restores the sight of people with this rare and distressing condition,\u201d said the NHS chief executive, Simon Stevens.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Back to school after a decade of austerity\n\nEducation correspondent Sally Weale tells Anushka Asthana how nearly 10 years of government cuts in school funding have fed through to the classroom. Plus Dr David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist, on why he chastised Jacob Rees-Mogg over his support for a possible no-deal Brexit.\n\nToday in Focus Decade of austerity in schools Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2019/09/03-64282-190904TIF_schools.mp3 00:00:00 00:29:16\n\nLunchtime read: Strung out \u2013 the afterlife of puppet stars\n\n\u201cThis thing is alive, this thing is alive, this thing is alive.\u201d That insistence, says puppeteer Toby Oli\u00e9, is essential to his job. \u201cYou are the soul and life force of a puppet, and you\u2019re using suspension of disbelief to animate. So when the puppeteer lets go, that\u2019s the moment of death.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A giant marionette, part of the French Theatre company Royal De Luxe\u2019s performance of The Sultan\u2019s Elephant in London, May 2006.

When the curtain falls on a marionette\u2019s show, they\u2019re put out to pasture, given a facelift \u2013 or turned into burglar deterrents, Kate Wyver discovers.\n\nSport\n\nTim Paine has admitted to having sleepless nights over Ben Stokes as the gripping battle for the Ashes resumes today at Old Trafford, the scene of many great memories. England have made one change with Craig Overton coming into the side in place of Chris Woakes while Australia\u2019s patience with their under-achieving batsman Usman Khawaja has finally run out. Serena Williams claimed her 100th win at the US Open in style, dismantling her quarter-final opponent Wang Qiang 6-1, 6-0 in a blistering 44-minute performance, but Johanna Konta\u2019s involvement at Flushing Meadows was ended in a tight match against Elina Svitolina. In the men\u2019s draw Daniil Medvedev reached his first grand slam semi-final after overcoming injuries and a hostile reception from the crowd to beat Stan Wawrinka. Grigor Dimitrov took advantage of an ailing Roger Federer to beat the Swiss for the first time in his career and book a place in the semi-finals.\n\nPhil Neville said \u201chumility is one of our biggest values\u201d after being accused of arrogance following \u201cout of context\u201d quotes used in the buildup to England\u2019s 2-1 defeat to Norway in Bergen. The England manager also dismissed reports linking him to the US women\u2019s national team. And England will finally unleash Bath\u2019s uncapped Ruaridh McConnochie on Friday as they seek to conclude their World Cup preparations with a flourish against Italy in Newcastle.\n\nBusiness\n\nSterling was one of the winners from last night\u2019s parliamentary uproar as the prospect of MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit pushed the ailing currency back up against the US dollar. Earlier on Tuesday it had sunk to a 33-year low of $1.1959 but the PM\u2019s Commons defeat saw it rally and it\u2019s now sitting at $1.211. It\u2019s also up against the euro at \u20ac1.1027. Meanwhile, the global downturn has reached Australia, where the economy recorded its worst growth since 2009. The FTSE100 is set to open up by about a third of a percentage point.\n\nThe papers\n\nYou can see our wrap of the papers here but in short: The Times gives weight to its front-page picture of an animated prime minister beneath the headline: \u201cPM loses historic vote\u201d. It says he \u201clost control of Brexit\u201d, a theme echoed by the Mirror and the i.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guardian front page, Wednesday 4 September 2019. Photograph: Guardian\n\nThe Guardian focuses on the significance of the defeat, calling it a \u201chumiliation\u201d for the PM. It also highlights the notable Tory rebels and the loss of the government\u2019s majority after Phillip Lee walked. The Telegraph uses the headline: \u201cJohnson demands election\u201d and an image of the PM looking composed at the dispatch box. It carries a graphic with the numbers for last night\u2019s vote without referring to the defeat. The Matt cartoon has the pets of Downing Street saying: \u201cSomebody has made a horrible mess and I\u2019m not clearing it up.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Times says Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy is \u201cin ruins\u201d and uses an image of a contemplative PM alongside Andrea Leadsom and Sajid Javid. The Mail heads straight to the prospect of the UK \u201churtling\u201d towards an election next month. It gets a picture of Jeremy Corbyn and a \u201cBritain needs you\u201d-style image of Johnson, with the headline: \u201cNow you decide, Britain\u201d. The Sun echoes the Mail and Telegraph with Johnson\u2019s call for an election, saying it is time to let Britain decide. The Express criticises the Tory rebels and parliament in general, accusing them of \u201cbetraying Brexit\u201d on a shameful day for democracy. \u201cParliament surrenders to the EU\u201d is the headline. Further afield, Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad links Johnson\u2019s struggles to those of his predecessor, Theresa May. Its intro says: \u201cA different premier, a different style, a different rhetoric, but the same outcome.\u201d\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
