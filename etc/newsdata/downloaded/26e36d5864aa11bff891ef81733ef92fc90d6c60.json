Schumer of New York and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Zaid took issue with Ms. Ingraham afterward and said that she had likely mistaken him for Andrew P. Bakaj, a co-counsel for the whistleblower who had interned for Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton while in college nearly 20 years earlier.\n\n\u201cThe partisans are trying to smear the legal team as some liberal opposition. We are anything but that. I\u2019ve never been anything other than registered Independent & proud of it,\u201d Mr. Zaid said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI go after every Administration, regardless of who holds political office or party,\u201d said Mr. Zaid, noting that he previously worked closely with Republicans including Rep. Devin Nunes of California and former congressman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina.\n\nMr. Ingraham acknowledged on-air later Thursday that she had confused the whistleblower\u2019s two lawyers.\n\n\u201cI was mistaking Mark for another attorney representing the attorney named Andrew Bakaj, who just worked for Clinton and Schumer. So it was a different lawyer,\u201d said Ms. Ingraham.\n\n\u201cI apologize for that mixup,\u201d she added.\n\nMr. Bakaj did not immediately return a message requesting comment. He interned for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Schumer in 2001, according to his LinkedIn profile. He subsequently worked as a law clerk for the Department of Justice, then as an investigator for the Department of Defense and CIA inspectors general before entering private practice, according to his profile.\n\nDemocrats controlling the House of Representatives initiated an impeachment inquiry last week after the Trump administration tried to block members of Congress from viewing the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. The White House subsequently released a rough transcript of a July telephone call that triggered the complaint, and it shows that the president had asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nMr. Trump reiterated his request Thursday morning, asking Ukraine as well as China to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
