After the win here against Tottenham Hotspur last week, this was a very different challenge and they overcame it with pizzazz. Newcastle wound up a rabble with their manager, Steve Bruce, condemning \u201ca complete surrender\u201d.\n\nRicardo Pereira got Leicester going with a superb goal in the first half before Isaac Hayden was sent off for Newcastle, who had already begun to crumble with 11 players. Jamie Vardy scored twice in the second half, Wilfred Ndidi helped himself to one and the visitors\u2019 haplessness was encapsulated by Paul Dummett inadvertently diverting a cross by Dennis Praet into his own goal.\n\nLeicester City 5-0 Newcastle United: Premier League \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nLeicester made it all look so straightforward that one could easily have been duped into thinking this contest was always likely to pan out this way. But Newcastle have been something of a b\u00eate noire et blanche to Leicester in recent seasons, winning here on their last two visits by absorbing pressure before striking on the counter-attack. Brendan Rodgers had anticipated them taking a similar approach this time so warned his players to be patient. This, he said, would be a serious test of their creativity, all the more so without James Maddison, who was absent with an ankle injury.\n\nIt transpired that Leicester needed just 16 minutes to open the scoring. Once they started, only the final whistle could stop them. \u201cWe were nowhere near the level required,\u201d Bruce said, accusing his side of \u201ccomplete surrender, too quickly, too easily. I\u2019ve only been [Newcastle\u2019s manager] for two or three months but I certainly hadn\u2019t witnessed what I witnessed here\u201d.\n\nAt least it took a goal of true beauty to open up Newcastle the first time. Pereira picked up the ball in his right\u2011back position and hurtled forward, exchanging a snappy one-two with Ayoze P\u00e9rez near the touchline before charging to the edge of the box, from where he sent a wonderful low curling shot beyond the reach of Martin Dubravka. No wonder Rodgers ranks the Portuguese among the Premier\u2019s League best right-backs, saying: \u201cYoung Trent [Alexander-Arnold] at Liverpool and Kyle Walker at Manchester City are top operators and [Pereira] is right up there with them.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ricardo Pereira celebrates opening the scoring.

In the second minute Harvey Barnes stormed down the left and sent over a low cross that invited Perez to score against the club he left in the summer, but the forward failed to make a clean connection from eight yards, leaving Dubravka with a comfortable save.\n\nNewcastle briefly looked dangerous after that, with Miguel Almir\u00f3n particularly bright for about a quarter of an hour. But once Pereira scored, Newcastle were forced to accept their inferior status. Leicester soon made the class distinction even clearer.\n\nThey nearly doubled their lead within two minutes, the artful Youri Tielemans releasing Ben Chilwell for a close-range shot that Dubravka did well to block. The interplay down the left between Tielemans, Chilwell and Harvey Barnes became a regular delight for onlookers, except the overwhelmed ones in black and white.\n\nNewcastle\u2019s ordeal deepened when Hayden was ordered off for a reckless tackle on Praet. The midfielder protested he had won the ball but the more pertinent fact was that after doing so he careered into his opponent, driving his right foot into Praet\u2019s shin.\n\nDominant though Leicester were, Vardy had little sight of goal in the first half, apart from a header that he glanced over the bar. But in the 54th minute Leicester\u2019s arch-predator made his mark following another elegantly worked move. Chilwell started it with a nice dummy and pass in midfield before Tielemans dabbed the ball into the path of Vardy, whose shot was well struck but, even so, should have been saved the near post by Dubravka, who let it squirt past him.\n\nRodgers\u2019 Leicester hope to show they have learned from home discomforts Read more\n\nThe contest was effectively over but Rodgers\u2019 side did not just want to beat Newcastle, they wanted to demolish them. \u201cThe players showed wonderful appetite,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cWe were hungry for goals.\u201d\n\nNewcastle put up feeble resistance. When Praet won the ball in midfield, he offloaded it to Pereira and ran forward to receive the return pass before trying to cross to a teammate in the middle. His cross deflected off Dummett and into the net. Marc Albrighton came off the bench to add to the home team\u2019s fun, supplying a characteristically precise cross to Vardy, who nodded in to make it 4-0. From a similar area on the left, Chilwell delivered the cross that led to the fifth goal, Ndidi taking it down before swivelling and shooting low into the net.\n\nSince Rodgers took charge in February, Leicester have amassed more Premier League points than anyone but Manchester City and Liverpool. Next week they go to Anfield for a match that will arguably be the biggest test either of those sides has faced this season. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it because I haven\u2019t been back since I left,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a tough game, of course, but we\u2019ll look to embrace that challenge.\u201d", "description": "Leicester City move up to third in the Premier League with a 5-0 thrashing of Newcastle United at the King Power Stadium", "authors": ["Paul Doyle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f70c3c8f9b1071aa01b891cba48ed5c775eba17/0_132_3952_2372/master/3952.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=afc409e998b9f7b23bbe4074f4dcdf76", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
