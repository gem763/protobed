How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.\n\nWith a 1.8% yield and a nine-year payment history, investors probably think Mastermyne Group looks like a reliable dividend stock. A low yield is generally a turn-off, but if the prospects for earnings growth were strong, investors might be pleasantly surprised by the long-term results. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Mastermyne Group!\n\nASX:MYE Historical Dividend Yield, October 11th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. In the last year, Mastermyne Group paid out 28% of its profit as dividends. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.\n\nWhile the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Mastermyne Group's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.\n\nWe update our data on Mastermyne Group every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Looking at the last decade of data, we can see that Mastermyne Group paid its first dividend at least nine years ago. Although it has been paying a dividend for several years now, the dividend has been cut at least once by more than 20%, and we're cautious about the consistency of its dividend across a full economic cycle. During the past nine-year period, the first annual payment was AU$0.012 in 2010, compared to AU$0.02 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 5.8% per year over this time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.\n\nDividends have grown at a reasonable rate, but with at least one substantial cut in the payments, we're not certain this dividend stock would be ideal for someone intending to live on the income.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Mastermyne Group has grown its earnings per share at 13% per annum over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing at a good rate, and the company is paying less than half its earnings as dividends. We generally think this is an attractive combination, as it permits further reinvestment in the business.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is Mastermyne Group Limited (ASX:MYE) a good dividend stock?
