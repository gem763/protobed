We like to say, \u2018There isn\u2019t a plastic ceiling that Barbie hasn\u2019t broken,\u2019\u201d she concluded.\n\nThe doll\u2019s debut is part of an initiative the company started in 2018 called the \u201cBarbie Dream Gap Project,\u201d which seeks to raise awareness about how girls begin to doubt their intelligence around age 5, according to USA Today.\n\nThe report continued:\n\nThis phenomenon, referred to as the \u2018dream gap,\u2019 was proven by researchers at New York University, the University of Illinois and Princeton University. They found that stereotypes associate a high-level of intellectual ability with men more than women. Thus, when young girls are exposed to these stereotypes, they don\u2019t always pursue careers that require intelligence. This begins at prepubescence. Girls begin to avoid those brain-stimulating activities and boys move on, creating a gap.\n\nJudge Barbie comes in four different skin tones and includes a gavel and round block \u201cthat kids can use to help her call the room to order and make important decisions,\u201d according to the toy\u2019s description on Amazon.\n\n\u201cA career-themed look for each includes a customary black robe with lacy collar that can be removed to reveal a floral printed dress. Makes a great gift for kids intrigued by the law and who love to keep things fair!\u201d the details concluded.\n\nReports said the Barbie Dream Gap Project has partnered with GoFundMe to raise money to close the so-called \u201cdream gap.\u201d The funds will go to nonprofit organizations that support female empowerment such as She\u2019s the First, She Should Run, and Step Up.\n\n\u201cAs the original girl empowerment brand, Barbie is committed to inspiring the limitless potential in every girl,\u201d the initiative\u2019s website stated.\n\n\u201cThe dream gap is contrary to our beliefs and brand purpose, that\u2019s why we\u2019re using our platform and resources to champion change and show girls they can be anything!\u201d the website said.\n\nOn September 25, Breitbart News reported that Mattel also introduced a line of \u201cgender-neutral dolls\u201d for kids who do not want their \u201ctoys to be dictated by gender norms,\u201d the company said.\n\n\u201cWhen the company rolled out the dolls, Mattel toned down typically masculine and feminine features and featured kits addressed with the pronoun \u2018they\u2019 and the slogan \u2018A doll line designed to keep labels out and invite everyone in,'\u201d the report concluded.", "description": "The Mattel toy company has recently introduced its 2019 Barbie Career of the Year doll, the Barbie Judge Doll.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Judge-Barbie-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
