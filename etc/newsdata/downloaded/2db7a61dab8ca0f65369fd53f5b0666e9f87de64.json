It gives 120 countries the ability to ship about 1.5 percent of U.S.'s total imports without paying tariffs.\n\nUkraine's GSP privileges had been suspended in December 2017 because of the country's repeated violation of U.S. intellectual property rights laws. The suspension began in May of 2018.\n\nLighthizer's recommendation on Ukraine's trade status came after Ukraine spent the past year passing laws in an effort to crack down on its rampant piracy.\n\nBy the time Lighthizer was ready to bring his recommendation to the president, it had already been reviewed by the State Department and the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nLast month, a senior Trump administration official told the Post that the delay in the status change of Ukraine's trade privileges was due to a routine country review.\n\nHowever, William Taylor's testimony to congressional investigators earlier in the week seems to contradict that.\n\nThe former top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine told House committees Tuesday that on Aug. 22, Tim Morrison, the National Security Council\u2019s top Russia official, informed him that \u201cthe president doesn\u2019t want to provide any assistance at all,\u201d referring to Ukraine and the U.S. aid that had been promised to the country.\n\nTaylor continued, saying that on Sept. 1, Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, told him that \"everything\" was dependent on whether or not Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would publicly announce that he would investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and accusations of Ukrainian interference during the 2016 election.", "description": "White House officials delayed a trade agreement\u00a0with Ukraine in late August, around the same time President Trump was withholding security aid to the country,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_10022019getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
