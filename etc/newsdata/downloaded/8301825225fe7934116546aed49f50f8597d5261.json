Her participation comes in the wake of her party\u2019s ongoing impeachment efforts.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to welcome the highest-ranking Democrat and the most powerful woman in American political history back to Polk County,\u201d Polk County Democrats chair Sean Bagniewski said in a statement.\n\nAs the Des Moines Register noted, Pelosi also spoke to the Polk Country Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. At the time, she told her fellow party members to focus on cohesive messaging and communication in order to take back the House.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi joined us last year to talk about her bold plans to take back the House,\u201d Bagniewski continued.\n\n\u201cWith Iowa\u2019s three out of four U.S. House seats now held by Democrats, she\u2019ll be here to talk about how we can expand on Democratic victories in the Midwest,\u201d he added.\n\nPelosi\u2019s visit comes in the wake of her party\u2019s impeachment inquiry, which remains widely unpopular in key congressional districts, internal polling suggests.\n\nRepublican leaders were recently briefed on the Public Opinion Strategies\u2019 internal poll, taken for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) and Team McCarthy. It found the majority of voters, 59 percent, do not view President Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as an impeachable offense.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nThe poll shows the majority, 59 percent, do not view the conversation as an impeachable offense, while 37 percent view it as impeachable. While opinions on impeachment are largely divided on party lines, the majority of independents\u2013 57 percent \u2013 do not view the conversation itself as impeachable. The survey spelled trouble for Democrats who hold seats in Trump-won districts. The vast majority \u2013 62 percent \u2013 consider the conversation between the two leaders was \u201cappropriate.\u201d Only 33 percent considered it impeachable. Furthermore, Republican candidates in Trump districts represented by Democrats hold a \u201cdouble-digit advantage\u201d over impeachment-supporting Democrats.\n\nThe memo concluded, \u201cvoters clearly believe impeachment is sidetracking the country and Congress, will keep Congress from getting anything else done, and cause even deeper partisan divisions in the country.\u201d", "description": "Nancy Pelosi is expected to head to Iowa ahead of the February 3 caucuses to speak at an event hosted by the Polk County Democrats.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Nancy-Pelosi-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
