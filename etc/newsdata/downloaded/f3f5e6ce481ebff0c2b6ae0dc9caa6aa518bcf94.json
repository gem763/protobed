Often the abused person has been isolated from family by the abuser or told to choose between the relationship and family. Because of the dependence that has formed the abused will not do anything to jeopardise the relationship, even if it means foregoing family contact,\" they way.\n\nThey also advise that you avoid pressurising your loved one as this may only reinforce the negative messages they are already hearing from the abuser. \"Whatever you do, avoid directly confronting towards the abuser; this could make things worse for your loved one... Be patient: it is important for the abused to know they are loved and that support is there. Eventually they will use it,\" they add.\n\nREAD MORE: Maid of honour\u2019s hilarious response to bride\u2019s instruction to wear \u2018anything\u2019 to wedding\n\nHere is what three Reddit users had to say about the maid of honour's story:\n\n- The regret should be that the BFF may one day wake up to what she\u2019s done.

I hope your friend makes it out alive and ok one day. And that you\u2019re safe from him too. I don\u2019t want to see you show up on the news.
