If that is not foreshadowed, traders expect the dollar to rise.\n\n\u201cIf the market is going to price in the end of current rate-cut cycle, the dollar/yen could climb above 110 yen,\u201d said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan markets research at JPMorgan Chase Bank.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, if the market is going to price in two more cuts after this month\u2019s expected cut, the pair could fall to mid-107 yen level,\u201d he added.\n\nRISK ASSETS\n\nOptimism that Washington and Beijing would finalise the first-stage of a trade deal next month had boosted risk assets in recent days, but markets have turned wary.\n\nA U.S. administration official said on Tuesday an interim trade agreement between the United States and China might not be completed in time for signing on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit in Chile next month, but that does not mean the accord is falling apart.\n\nThe Chinese yuan inched up marginally as investors awaited the outcome of the Fed meeting and more clarity on how Sino-U.S. trade negotiations are going.\n\nIn the spot market, offshore spot yuan CNH=EBS was last changing hands at 7.0580, a touch firmer on the day.\n\nEarlier in the onshore market, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate CNY=PBOC at a two-month high of 7.0582 per dollar, 35 pips firmer than Tuesday's fix.\n\nSterling meanwhile drew support from hopes that a disorderly Brexit can be avoided.\n\nBritain will hold its first December election in almost a century after Prime Minister Boris Johnson won approval from the House of Commons on Tuesday for an early ballot aimed at breaking the deadlock over the UK leaving the European Union\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe British pound was last at $1.2874 GBP=D3, little changed on the day and below five-month highs hit earlier this month. It was also steady at 86.34 pence EURGBP=D3.\n\n\u201cJohnson has cross-party support and (the opposition) Labour Party has lost a fair lot of the credibility it had in the 2017 election,\u201d said MUFG\u2019s Halpenny.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s reflected in the stability in sterling - markets believe the Conservative party will hold on to power and have a Brexit deal agreed with the EU.\u201d", "description": "The dollar was steady against other major currencies on Wednesday as investors braced for a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and an advance reading of economic growth in the third quarter that could shed light on the rate outlook.", "authors": ["Dhara Ranasinghe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446015526&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S01G", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
