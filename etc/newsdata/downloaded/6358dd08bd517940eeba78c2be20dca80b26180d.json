Barkley was an unused substitute.\n\nBarkley has impressed Southgate over recent months for England, but the former Everton star will be well aware that slipping down the Chelsea pecking order has left his international place vulnerable.", "description": "Mason Mount is pushing to take Ross Barkley\u2019s England place, having already jumped ahead of the midfielder in the Chelsea pecking order.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000209097841-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq0cFmALfDe88GEY3O6DWJbzXYafLZgJ5HdAz1f2P3Kuc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
