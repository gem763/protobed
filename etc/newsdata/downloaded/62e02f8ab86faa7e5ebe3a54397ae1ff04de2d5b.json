The most notable example is his long-standing rivalry with FS1's Colin Cowherd dating back to 2018, when Cowherd was critical of the Browns' decision to draft the 2017 Heisman Trophy winner No. 1 overall.\n\nThere is a spotlight on Cleveland probably brighter than any the franchise has had since returning to the NFL in 1999. It seemed justified after Mayfield threw an NFL rookie-record 27 touchdown passes and Odell Beckham Jr. joined the offense this offseason.\n\nThings haven't gone as planned to this point. The 24-year-old Mayfield ranks 30th out of 35 qualified quarterbacks with a 56.9 percent completion rate. He has three touchdowns, five interceptions and has been sacked 11 times through three games.\n\nThe Browns' 1-2 start isn't encouraging, but they can move into a tie for first place in the AFC North with a win over the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium.\n\nIf Mayfield gets back to playing like he did as a rookie, these early-season criticisms from analysts will go away.", "description": "Baker Mayfield is unhappy with comments made by ESPN analyst  Rex Ryan  following the  Cleveland Browns ' 20-13 home loss to the  Los Angeles Rams  in Week 3.
