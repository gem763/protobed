Sanders has certainly seen himself as the leader of a movement. He took his campaign assets and converted them into \u201cOur Revolution,\u201d a political organization devoted to recruit, support, promote, and elect far-left candidates (and not coincidentally benefit Sanders).\n\nSimilarly, at recent campaign rallies, Warren has spoken about using movement-driven pressure from outside groups while she works inside the system. It is easy to imagine her following Sanders in repurposing her campaign assets into an outside group, regardless of the outcome of the 2020 cycle.\n\nIndeed, Sanders can be seen as following in the footsteps of Barack Obama. The then-president used the Democratic National Committee to form \u201cOrganizing For America\u201d (OFA), which became the so-called grassroots arm of his re-election campaign. The group was later spun off into the nonprofit \u201cOrganizing For Action,\u201d which now assists the \u201cresistance\u201d to President Trump.", "description": "", "authors": ["Warren Henry", "Thefederalist.Com Do-Elizabeth-Warren-And-Bernie-Sanders-Preview-A-Democratic-Populist-Crack-Up"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
