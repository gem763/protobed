I have no doubt that he will thoughtfully lead BP through the transition to a low-carbon future.\u201d\n\nBP shares were up 1.1% by 1030 GMT in London, compared with a 0.74% gain for rival Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L).\n\n(GRAPHIC - BP profits: here)\n\nFILE PHOTO: Bob Dudley, Group Chief Executive, BP, speaks at the 2019 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., April 29, 2019.

But many investors and activists say the 110-year-old firm needs to do more.\n\nDudley, who took the helm months after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest oil spill in U.S. history that left 11 rig workers dead, has resisted setting wider climate targets, often quoting the fear of litigation.\n\nAs Looney takes over, climate is bound to be central.\n\n\u201cGiven the drive for digital solutions and the work on reducing carbon emissions it is likely that the appointment of Mr Looney as CEO may accelerate the journey that BP is on regarding the energy transition,\u201d Barclays analyst Lydia Rainforth said in a note.\n\nNEAR-BUST TO BOOM\n\nDudley will step down as CEO after the company\u2019s full-year results on Feb. 4, 2020 and will retire on March 31, BP said.\n\nDudley, who succeeded Tony Hayward, led the company through near-bankruptcy after the spill and through an oil price crash four years later.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of BP is seen at a petrol station in Kloten, Switzerland October 3, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nPreparations for Dudley\u2019s departure were accelerated after Helge Lund became BP chairman in January with a mandate to oversee succession plans.\n\nDudley has had to navigate a vast asset disposal to pay for more than $60 billion in litigation and clean-up costs followed by a landmark settlement with U.S. authorities.\n\nDudley has had overwhelming support from investors at BP\u2019s annual general meetings, however a majority of shareholders opposed his 2016 pay package, forcing the company to slash it by 40%.", "description": "Bernard Looney, who will replace Bob Dudley as chief executive of BP when he retires next year, faces the tricky task of navigating the energy major through a rising tide of environmentalism and the move to a low-carbon economy.", "authors": ["Ron Bousso", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436924069&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930E2", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
