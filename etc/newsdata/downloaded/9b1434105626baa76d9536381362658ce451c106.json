We love China,\u201d he said, standing alongside fellow Rockets guard Russell Westbrook.\n\n\u201cWe love playing there. Both of us, we go there once or twice a year. They show us most support so we appreciate them.\u201d\n\nThe furore comes after general manager Daryl Morey \u2014 whose Rockets have had a huge following in China since they signed Yao Ming in 2002 \u2014 posted a tweet Friday featuring the message \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nOn Monday he tried to calm the water.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Get out of China\u2019 \u2013\n\nSemi-autonomous Hong Kong has been battered by four months of increasingly violent pro-democracy protests.\n\nThe rallies were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, fuelling fears of an erosion of liberties in Hong Kong under the 50-year \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model China agreed before the 1997 handover from Britain.\n\nThe NBA issued its own statement, saying it recognised Morey\u2019s views \u201chave offended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them,\u201d the statement issued by chief communications officer Mike Bass said.\n\nBut a Chinese-language version of the statement posted on Weibo went further, saying the NBA was \u201cdeeply disappointed by the inappropriate remarks\u201d.\n\nIn the United States, the NBA found itself under fire for its apology, which presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Texan, called \u201can embarrassment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s statement also did little to mollify fans in China, with furious comments among the 15,000 responses on Weibo.\n\n\u201cThis is an apology?\u201d one user wrote. \u201cGet out of China,\u201d added another.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Incorrect comments\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets are due to play pre-season games in Shanghai and Shenzhen later this week.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV and Tencent Holdings, which streams NBA games in China, have both said they will halt Rockets broadcasts.\n\nAnd sponsors including sportswear brand Li Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank announced they were cutting ties.\n\nThe moves came after the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) said it would sever ties with the Rockets over Morey\u2019s \u201cincorrect comments\u201d.\n\nThe Rockets had already tried to distance themselves from the controversy, with owner Tilman Fertitta on Friday writing on Twitter that Morey \u201cdoes NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets\u2026 we are NOT a political organization.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets are in Japan for two exhibition games and Harden said Monday that remained the team\u2019s focus.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we\u2019re here in Japan is we got two amazing games tomorrow and Thursday,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201c(It\u2019s) an opportunity for fans to come and watch NBA\u2026 we\u2019re excited to be here.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Houston Rockets star James Harden on Monday apologised to China over a tweet by the team\u2019s general manager backing Hong", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/2160ce_houston-rockets-star-james-harden-2nd-instructs-his-teammates-session-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
