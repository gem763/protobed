(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nCancer-causing contaminants may be in your drinking water, according to a new study published in the journal Heliyon.\n\nScientists at the Environmental Working Group (EWG) analyzed pollutants in tap water from 2010 to 2017. They found 22 carcinogenic contaminants \u2014 including arsenic, disinfection byproducts, and radioactive contaminants, such as uranium and radium \u2014 in drinking water nationwide, which researchers estimate could, over the course of an average lifetime (about 70 years), lead to 100,000 cases of cancer.\n\nIn the study, EWG scientists calculated the cumulative health effects of these carcinogens in more than 48,000 community water systems in the U.S. (not including the 13.5 million Americans who rely on private wells for drinking water).\n\n\u201cThe results of this analysis show that, over a lifetime of exposure to these contaminants in drinking water, we would expect that 100,000 cancer cases in the United States would be due to these drinking water contaminants,\u201d Sydney Evans, lead author of the study and a science analyst at EWG, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cContaminants present in drinking water all across the United States \u2014 at concentrations that are perfectly legal and get a passing grade from federal government \u2014 can still increase the risk of cancer.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cRight now, water contaminants are assessed and regulated one at a time, but mixtures of a large number of contaminants are present in tap water. This cumulative risk assessment will help to estimate how mixtures of chemicals might affect health, so that community water systems and elected officials can look for new approaches to better protect water quality.\u201d\n\nThe analysis also found that water systems with the highest risk tend to be small groundwater systems. \u201cThese systems typically lack the resources, funding, and infrastructure to effectively manage water contamination, and arsenic \u2014 a potent carcinogen \u2014 is typically found in groundwater,\u201d says Evans.\n\nBut larger water systems aren\u2019t necessarily safer. Evans says they also show \u201cconsistently elevated risk\u201d because they contain disinfection byproducts, which are a result of required disinfection. \u201cParts of the country where source water has a high level of organic waste \u2014 like manure, dead vegetation, agricultural and urban run-off \u2014 tend to have higher levels of disinfection byproducts, which could result in an increased risk of cancer,\u201d she says.\n\nEvans also points out that the study only assessed 22 carcinogenic contaminants and noted that this is not an exhaustive list. \u201cThere are contaminants in drinking water that pose health risks other than cancer,\u201d she says.\n\nSo what can you do to protect your health in the meantime?\n\nEvans recommends that consumers find out what contaminants are in their tap water from either local water quality reports or the EWG Tap Water Database, which lets you search by zip code.\n\nNext, install a water filter (EWG has an online water filter buying guide) that works best for your local tap water, depending on the specific contaminants in your area. \u201cEven if detected contaminants are below the federal legal limits, we recommend filtering the drinking water,\u201d Evans says.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A new Environmental Working Group study says there are contaminants in drinking water that could increase the risk of cancer.", "authors": ["Rachel Grumman Bender", "Beauty", "Style Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/D9BM5ZLMOLxYk04iLN4YWA--~B/aD0yMjk4O3c9NDA5NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/c23fbe30-da35-11e9-9df0-1e6c520cd989", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
