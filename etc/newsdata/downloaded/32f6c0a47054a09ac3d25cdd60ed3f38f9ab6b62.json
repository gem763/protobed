I know because I checked with the intelligence community \u2014 or at least looked it up in the CIA World Factbook. But my point is that even though Malaysia has very few Jews, it apparently has its share of Jew-haters. Why should Malaysians miss out on this ancient yet increasingly fashionable brand of bigotry?\n\nMalaysia\u2019s most celebrated Jew-hater is Mahathir Mohamad, the country\u2019s 94-year-old former prime minister. Last week, Columbia University joined in the celebration.\n\nBen Cohen of the Algemeiner was apparently the only reporter who considered the event significant enough to cover. Mr. Mohamad, he wrote, addressed \u201ca packed audience at the university\u2019s Global Leaders Forum.\u201d\n\nNo one challenged Mr. Mohamad\u2019s right to voice his hatred of Jews. Nevertheless, he felt compelled to defend that right. \u201cWhen you say \u2018you cannot be anti-Semitic,\u2019 there is no free speech,\u201d he instructed his audience.\n\nHe has a point and, if Columbia President Lee Bollinger takes it to heart, the Global Leaders Forum will soon be inviting global leaders who are anti-black, anti-women, anti-Hispanic and anti-LGBTQ. Columbia can strike blow after blow for free speech.\n\nMr. Mohamad added: \u201cWhy can\u2019t I say something about the Jews, when people say nasty things about me and about Malaysia?\u201d\n\nThat troubles me, too. I find all those Malaysian jokes particularly offensive. Like the one about the Malaysian nonagenarian who goes into a bar with a duck on his head and \u2026 well, you\u2019ve probably heard it a hundred times before, so there\u2019s no point in my repeating it.\n\nAmong Mr. Mohamad\u2019s oft-stated beliefs: \u201cJews rule the world by proxy.\u201d Perhaps now, however, he realizes that exceptions to this rule include Columbia University \u2014 from which I have two graduate degrees, something I used to be proud of \u2014 and New York City where I was born and bred and where, back in the day, Jews did enjoy some influence.\n\nOld-timers like me remember when Jesse Jackson called the city \u201cHymietown.\u201d That caused outrage and he subsequently \u201cexpressed regret.\u201d There clearly will not be much outrage regarding Mr. Mohamad and he will not do as the Rev. Jackson did. That\u2019s one indication that anti-Semitism is on the rise.\n\nHere\u2019s another: In New York City last year, \u201cthere were four times as many hate crimes against Jews as against blacks,\u201d New York Times staff writer Bari Weiss recently noted. Jews \u201cbeaten with a brick; whipped with a belt \u2014 are the tips of anti-Semitic icebergs found on both the left and the right that have moved definitively and rapidly into mainstream waters.\u201d\n\nShe added that such attacks are \u201clargely not covered by the press perhaps because, as in a majority of anti-Semitic instances in New York, the perpetrators were not white supremacists.\u201d\n\nMr. Mohamad certainly doesn\u2019t fall into that basket of deplorables. Nor, I should mention, is he a Holocaust denier. Indeed, at Columbia he confirmed that \u201cthere was a Holocaust,\u201d and that there were \u201cmany Jews killed.\u201d How many? Six? Six thousand? Six million? He\u2019s apparently awaiting further evidence before he commits to a definitive number.\n\nHe did tell a young woman in the audience: \u201cI was very sympathetic to them during the war, that was when you were not around.\u201d Yes, and not having been around, the young woman cannot possibly appreciate how grateful Jewish victims of Nazism must have been to Mr. Mohamad for his sympathies. And, of course most of those victims, unlike Mr. Mohamad, are not around to inform her.\n\nMr. Cohen writes that the event moderator, Professor Lien-Hang T. Nguyen, never asked a tough question or challenged the speaker\u2019s assertions and expressions of prejudice and animus. I\u2019m sure Columbia faculty and students extend similar courtesy to speakers who identify as Republicans, conservatives and especially officials of the Trump administration. (You doubt that? Tsk, tsk. How cynical of you.)\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of wisdom that we can draw on from you,\u201d Professor Nguyen flattered the senescent politician. At the conclusion of the program, he exclaimed: \u201cThat was amazing.\u201d Yeah, like Mr. Mohamad didn\u2019t know that.\n\nI want to give Mr. Mohamad credit on one score: He\u2019s honest about his Jew-hatred. He doesn\u2019t pretend he\u2019s only attempting to champion Palestinian rights. He doesn\u2019t pretend to be supporting boycotts just to encourage Israelis to withdraw from \u201coccupied territories.\u201d He doesn\u2019t claim that he\u2019s not anti-Semitic but merely anti-Zionist.\n\nThat last claim I find particularly misleading and annoying. Because, given a choice, I\u2019ll take anti-Semites over anti-Zionists any day. Garden-variety anti-Semites \u2014 I\u2019m not talking about neo-Nazis or Stalinists or Khomeinists or Salafi/jihadis \u2014 disparage Jews. They don\u2019t want them working in their businesses, living in their neighborhoods or joining their clubs. That\u2019s nasty but disparagement is survivable, and alternative businesses, neighborhoods and clubs can generally be found.\n\nAnti-Zionists, by contrast, seek a more consequential goal. They want to deprive Israel of its fundamental right to exist. They want to end Jewish self-determination in any part of the ancient Jewish homeland, a unique refuge for Jews who fled not only from Europe but also \u2014 and in larger numbers \u2014 from Arab and Muslim countries.\n\nWere anti-Zionists to achieve their goal, were they to succeed in eradicating the Jewish state, what would happen to the more than 6 million Jewish Israelis who live there? I think you know. I think Mr. Mohamad knows, too. Perhaps he\u2019d be \u201cvery sympathetic to them.\u201d If he\u2019s still around, of course.\n\n\u2022 Clifford D.
