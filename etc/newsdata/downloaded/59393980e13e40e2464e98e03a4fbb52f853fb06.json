Council, frustrated by roadblocks in its investigation of possible ethics violations by member Jack Evans, voted 12 to 1 this week to allow city officials to ask a court to compel the lawmaker\u2019s private clients to cooperate.\n\nThe lone dissenting vote was cast by Evans.\n\nIt was one of several votes taken by the Ward 2 Democrat that have pertained to investigations of his conduct in office.\n\nThe idea of recusal \u2014 that the lawmaker should decline to act on a matter that would directly affect him \u2014 was never broached by Evans or his colleagues on the D.C. Council during Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\nCouncil rules give lawmakers discretion to decide when to sit out votes. But critics say Evans had an obvious and jaw-dropping conflict.\n\n\u201cHe very clearly and openly voted in his own interests,\u201d said Amber Harding, a local advocate for homeless people. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine this happening in any other scenario, where an employee would have a say in their own discipline or a criminal defendant getting a vote on a jury on their own conviction.\u201d\n\n[Rift deepens on D.C. Council in response to Jack Evans scandal]\n\nEvans, the council\u2019s longest-serving member, is the target of a federal grand jury investigation. Among other things, he is under scrutiny for appearing to use his council position to solicit employment from law and lobbying firms, and for receiving money and stock shares, which he says he returned, from a sign company that benefited from legislation he promoted.\n\nEarlier this year, Evans voted against launching an internal council probe of his conduct.\n\nHe backed a nominee to the city ethics board, which had been investigating him. Evans even cast the deciding vote that allowed him to keep his committee assignments when the council moved to punish him July.\n\nCraig Holman, a lobbyist for the watchdog group Public Citizen, said Evans\u2019s votes on the council investigation are especially disturbing after documents showed the veteran lawmaker attempted to stymie a separate Metro investigation of his conduct when he recently served as the transit agency\u2019s board chairman.\n\n\u201cHe can rig the investigation,\u201d Holman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Jack Evans over the course of the last few years actively try to derail or influence investigations involving his scandals. That just shows every reason to believe that if he has an opportunity to get involved in matters affecting his own investigation, he will try derailing or influencing the course of that investigation.\u201d\n\nHolman said the D.C. Council could stop Evans from voting on his own investigation by changing legislative rules to prohibit lawmakers from taking action \u201cthat directly and substantially affects that member.\u201d\n\nCurrent rules define a conflict of interest as taking actions \u201clikely to have a direct and predictable effect\u201d on the financial interests of the lawmaker or a \u201cclose associate.\u201d Recusals are uncommon.\n\nIn neighboring Maryland, state lawmakers do not vote on their own reprimands or censures.\n\nBut D.C. lawmakers routinely vote on their own disciplinary crackdowns. The late former council members Jim Graham and Marion Barry voted against their punishments in ethics scandals earlier this decade.\n\n[D.C. has a long history of ethics and corruption scandals]\n\nD.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) did not return a request for comment Wednesday but has previously said that Evans is under no obligation to recuse.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, he\u2019s a member, so he gets to vote,\u201d Mendelson said in July after Evans voted to protect his committee assignments.\n\nEven Evans\u2019s harshest critics on the council did not take issue with his vote Tuesday on the measure asking D.C. Superior Court to enforce subpoenas issued by the council in its Evans ethics investigation.\n\nMendelson said the legislation was necessary because several of Evans\u2019s consulting clients refused to talk with lawyers from an outside firm hired to conduct the probe. Evans said Tuesday that he opposed the bill because he opposed the original resolution authorizing the probe.\n\nHe did not return a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nCouncil member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) said she did not think Evans needed to recuse himself from that vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply asking, even though the matter involves him, should this law firm as an extension of the council have certain authorities to enforce subpoenas?\u201d Cheh said. \u201cThat\u2019s a more generic kind of question.\u201d\n\nCouncil member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) said the reason she did not object was that \u201cI knew that it would pass easily.\u201d\n\nSilverman and Cheh said Evans should not vote on future punitive measures, especially once the council decides what steps to take after the internal probe.\n\n\u201cGiven that council member Evans is under investigation by several entities, having him vote on his own discipline \u2014 even if it\u2019s not in violation of our rules \u2014 just makes us look like we are either covering up for him or unable to police ourselves,\u201d Silverman said.\n\nCouncil member Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large) said that Evans\u2019s votes on the internal probe \u201cdeteriorates our credibility as a body\u201d but that lawmakers had limited options to stop him. \u201cThe Council cannot prevent Councilmember Evans from voting without action from an ad hoc committee,\u201d White said in a statement. \u201cUntil then, the responsibility falls squarely on Councilmember Evans.\u201d\n\nThe other members of the council did not return requests for comment.\n\nSome critics said the council has damaged the public\u2019s trust by allowing Evans to repeatedly vote on the investigation.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t even recuse himself on the most obvious conflict of interest, you can\u2019t trust him to recuse himself on anything,\u201d said Laura Fuchs, a teachers union activist. \u201cI can\u2019t really trust our council has any mechanism to hold anyone accountable if they are clearly ignoring his constant conflicts of interest.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nD.C. government agencies missed chances to save lives before deadly fire\n\nQuestions swirl around D.C. gambling contract, but top official says it\u2019s fine\n\nCorbett Price resigns from Metro board in fallout from Jack Evans probe\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Critics say Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) shouldn\u2019t be able to cast votes on his own case, despite precedent.", "authors": ["Fenit Nirappil", "Reporter Covering D.C.
