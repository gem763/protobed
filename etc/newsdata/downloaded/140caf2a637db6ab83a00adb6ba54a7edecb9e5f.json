Circuit judges said the temporary stay was granted to freeze the status quo while the court considers whether to grant a longer stay that would remain in effect until the appeal is argued or decided. The appeals court\u2019s one-page order contained boilerplate language saying the action on Tuesday \u201cshould not be construed in any way as a ruling\u201d on whether the Justice Department is entitled to a more protracted stay.\n\nThe three judges who issued the temporary stay, Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard and Robert Wilkins, are all appointees of President Barack Obama. The order did not say the same judges considering the stay would hear the appeal, but that would be typical in the D.C. Circuit.\n\nThe appeals court\u2019s move came after House Democrats\u2019 lawyers warned earlier in the day that the Justice Department might be seeking to stall the impeachment inquiry by dragging out the court fight.\n\nThe warning was contained in a filing submitted to Howell opposing the administration\u2019s request to stay her ruling granting the House Judiciary Committee access to the secret grand jury information Mueller relied on to write his final report.\n\n\u201cEvery day that the Committee is without the redacted information undercuts the Committee\u2019s ability to determine whether to impeach the President,\u201d House general counsel Douglas Letter wrote.\n\n\u201cDelay in this case would not only hinder the House\u2019s ability to consider impeachment quickly, but also enhance DOJ\u2019s ability to run out the clock on the Committee\u2019s impeachment inquiry altogether. \u2026 That would further undermine the public interest,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Trump administration has appealed Howell\u2019s decision, while also asking her and the D.C. Circuit to put off the Wednesday deadline she set for the Justice Department to turn over the Mueller materials.\n\nWhen asking Howell for a stay, Justice Department attorneys asserted that the Mueller investigation is now peripheral to the impeachment activity in the House, where a slew of witnesses have been appearing in closed-door sessions in recent days before the House Intelligence Committee to discuss allegations that Trump pushed to withhold U.S. security aid to Ukraine until the country opened an investigation into Joe Biden, his political rival and a leading Democratic presidential contender.\n\nIn the new filing, House lawyers disputed that Mueller\u2019s investigation had become a footnote, insisting that the Judiciary Committee\u2019s Mueller-related inquiry remained highly relevant to the existing impeachment process.\n\n\u201cDOJ is wrong about the scope of the House\u2019s inquiry,\u201d Letter wrote. \u201cAs the Speaker and the undersigned counsel have confirmed, the Committee\u2019s investigation is part of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe House submission also criticizes \u2014 in two separate places \u2014 the Justice Department for an unusual aspect of their stay filing: its reliance on a Washington Post article that asserted Trump\u2019s potential Mueller-related wrongdoing was now on the back burner as the Ukraine focus intensified.\n\n\u201cIn seeking a stay, DOJ ignores Speaker Pelosi\u2019s actual remarks \u2026 in favor of a news article that does not quote the Speaker on the relevant issue,\u201d Letter wrote.\n\nHowell had not ruled on the stay request by the time the appeals court issued its order on Tuesday. Justice Department lawyers indicated that they were prepared to go to the Supreme Court if neither court acted to delay Howell\u2019s ruling.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/54/78/3eae3d0243898de485a4e13fc3ed/191029-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
