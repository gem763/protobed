Gov Justin Fairfax are now an issue in the state\u2019s legislative elections, with Republicans running a new hard-hitting ad against Democrats who refused to listen to his accusers.\n\nOne ad, running in Northern Virginia\u2019s suburbs, begins with video from a CBS interview with two women describing being forced into sex acts by Mr. Fairfax in 2000 and 2004.\n\nMr. Fairfax has said the encounters were consensual.\n\nHe is not on the ballot this year, but all 140 seats in the General Assembly \u2014 100 in the House and 40 in the Senate \u2014 are. And Mr. Fairfax, as lieutenant governor, presides over the Senate.\n\nThe ad seeks to make Democrats pay for their refusal to give the two accusers the platform they\u2019d sought to tell their story.\n\nIn the ad running against Delegate John Bell, a Democrat running for a Senate seat that covers parts of Loudoun and Prince William counties, his GOP opponent says Mr. Bell blocked a legislative hearing for the women, Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson, in the assembly.\n\nThe add uses clips of a CBS interview with the two women describing being forced into sex.\n\n\u201cJohn Bell silenced these brave women and blocked a bipartisan independent investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Justin Fairfax. Bell should be ashamed,\u201d the announcer says.\n\nMr. Bell didn\u2019t respond Saturday morning to messages sent to emails for his official and campaign offices.\n\nThe ad cites a Feb. 21 story in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that detailed the GOP\u2019s efforts to force an investigation. The article does not appear to name Mr. Bell specifically, though Republicans have for months maintained he and several other Democratic delegates seeking Senate seats this year were the blockade.\n\nA top Democrat at the time called the effort to give the women a forum for their complaints \u201ca partisan sideshow.\u201d\n\nThe allegations against Mr. Fairfax come against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement, which saw some major figures ousted from their roles in Hollywood, media, business and Washington politics after allegations of sexual misbehavior, including rape.\n\nA GOP operative in the state said polling shows voters are troubled when told a delegate tried to silence the women. The title of the new ad is \u201cSilenced.\u201d\n\nMr. Fairfax is one of the state\u2019s top three elected officials, all Democrats, all of whom had scandal erupt earlier this year. It began when Gov. Ralph Northam was accused of wearing blackface several decades ago, based on a photo in a medical school yearbook.\n\nThe governor apologized, then waffled on whether it was in fact him in the photo, and ultimately rebuffed calls to resign.\n\nAround the same time Attorney General Mark Herring admitted he also had worn blackface.\n\nThe allegations against Mr. Fairfax, who is black, then emerged as it became clear he would be in line to assume the governorship should Mr. Northam resign.\n\nMr. Fairfax last month announced a lawsuit against CBS alleging the broadcast of the two women\u2019s claims defamed him.\n\nThat move spawned a new round of calls by state Republicans for hearings.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
