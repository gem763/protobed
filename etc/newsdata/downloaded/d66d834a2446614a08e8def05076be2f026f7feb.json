This might happen next week. Passing the Letwin amendment would trigger the Benn act, which compels Johnson to request an extension to article 50 if a deal cannot be agreed.\n\nLetwin said he supported Johnson\u2019s deal and it was \u201csensible\u201d, but that he wanted to make sure there is an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d that if the Brexit deal is approved but something goes wrong at a later stage the government has an extension already in place so there is no possible way the country can crash out without a deal. The deadline in the Benn act is 11pm on Saturday, so this is an attempt to close down a potential loophole.\n\nProfile Who is Oliver Letwin? Show Hide The unlikely Brexit rebel Sir Oliver Letwin was born in London in 1956. He studied at Eton and then Trinity College, Cambridge, and first became a Conservative MP in 1997. However, his political career had started long before then, as he had served in Margaret Thatcher's policy unit from 1983 to 1986. The poll tax was an idea Letwin almost single-handedly kept alive in the mid-1980s. In a 1985 memo, he suggested it could be introduced in Scotland first as \u201ca trailblazer for the real thing\u201d. In 2016 Letwin was forced to apologise after it emerged he had co-written a paper telling Thatcher that providing financial assistance for black unemployed youth after the 1985 riots would only end up in the \u201cdisco and drug trade\u201d. The memo, Letwin admitted, was \u201cbadly worded and wrong\u201d. Letwin was forced into hiding in 2001 by a desperate Conservative party, after being outed as the minister who had promised \u00a320bn of tax and spending cuts in an anonymous interview with the Financial Times, far beyond the party\u2019s manifesto at the time. In many respects, the best periods of Letwin\u2019s career were in the policy engine room, not least when he acted as David Cameron\u2019s fixer, when he was a cabinet office minister in the coalition government. His influence went far beyond the ministerial title. Then he wrestled with issues such as the future of press regulation in the aftermath of the Leveson inquiry. Letwin\u2019s big idea, to deal with the fact that newspapers refused to accept statutory regulation, was to create an independent regulator backed by royal charter. It was neat, but the mainstream press refused to accept it. Letwin has emerged as an unlikely Brexit rebel, going from being the ultimate loyalist to serial rebel, beginning in January 2019 when he voted with Labour to give Theresa May a two-week deadline to debate Brexit next steps if her deal was voted down. \u201cMy right honourable friend Sir Nicholas Soames, who is sitting next to me, and I have calculated that we have been in the house, collectively, for 56 years, and we have only ever, either of us, voted once against the Conservative whip,\u201d Letwin said. A month later his concerns had hardened, as demonstrated in a Commons speech in which he worried that \u201cwhen the chips are down\u201d the government \u201cwould prefer to do what some of my esteemed colleagues would prefer to do: head for the exit door without a deal\u201d. It was, he added, \u201ca terrifying fact\u201d \u2013 and one he resolved to prevent. Ultimately it was to cost him his place in the Conservative party, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson removed the whip from 21 Tory rebels including Letwin, as his Brexit plans were thwarted yet again. Dan Sabbagh Photograph: Hannah McKay/X03696\n\nThe amendment has the backing of Labour and has a good chance of passing: however, it has been heavily criticised for denying Johnson a conclusive vote on his deal.\n\nOther people to put their name to the amendment were Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, and the former Tory chancellor Philip Hammond.\n\nIf the government loses on the Letwin amendment, it is expected to boycott the rest of the day\u2019s proceedings, and press ahead with tabling the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 the legislation needed to enact Brexit.\n\nThere could then be a vote on the second reading of the bill on Tuesday \u2013 which government sources suggested could effectively become the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d denied to Johnson on Saturday.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s deal\n\nIf the Letwin amendment has not passed, MPs will then move on to vote for or against the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal. On the order paper, the government has stated: \u201cThat, in light of the new deal agreed with the European Union, which enables the United Kingdom to respect the result of the referendum on its membership of the European Union and to leave the European Union on 31 October with a deal.\u201d\n\nBut if the Letwin amendment has already been accepted, the motion would not signal approval \u2013 but would say the Commons \u201cwithholds approval unless and until implementing legislation is passed\u201d. Downing Street says that would make it a meaningless vote.\n\nThe Kyle amendment\n\nThis is attached to a second motion put down by the government on Saturday, which asks MPs to vote for a no-deal Brexit. The Labour MP Peter Kyle has tabled an amendment that calls for a second referendum.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s our hope that this will give greater focus and clarity to the debate and lessen the anxiety for colleagues grappling with the very real challenges \u2026 by separating them out.\u201d\n\nThe text of his amendment says any final decision on the future relationship between the UK and EU \u201cshould be subject to a confirmatory referendum before exit day\u201d.\n\nHowever, the government is not expected to move the no-deal motion \u2013 because Johnson wants to leave the EU with a deal.", "description": "What are the Letwin and Kyle amendments to the PM\u2019s deal being put before the Commons?", "authors": ["Owen Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9583d90dadff1914f568a2214ab75bdde8bc2d3/42_0_2368_1421/master/2368.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1694c8e2d8932ff111de9731b6c9d47c", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
