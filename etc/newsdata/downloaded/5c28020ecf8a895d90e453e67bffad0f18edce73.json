(Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters in Kabul on Sunday that \u201cthere has been a discussion\u201d within the Trump administration about leaving several hundred U.S. troops in northeast Syria despite the president\u2019s withdrawal order.\n\nEsper also said that, despite reports of intermittent fighting between Kurdish and Turkish forces in spite of the five-day ceasefire, the agreement \u201cgenerally seems to be holding.\u201d \u201cWe see a stability of the lines, if you will, on the ground,\u201d he added.\n\nEsper\u2019s comments confirmed a Sunday New York Times report that Trump was considering a Pentagon plan to leave roughly 200 special-forces troops in the area to check a potential ISIS resurgence and to protect oil fields from Russian and Syrian advancement.\n\nShould President Trump decide to leave troops in Syria, it will be the second time he has announced a total withdrawal from Syria only to recant within days. Trump hinted at the strategy in a Sunday tweet: \u201cWe have secured the Oil.\u201d He also mentioned oil security during an impromptu press conference on Friday.\n\nSecretary Esper on Sunday explained the rationale behind relocating 700 troops from Syria to western Iraq. \u201c[One objective] is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission as we sort through the next steps,\u201d he said. \u201cThings could change between now and whenever we complete the withdrawal, but that\u2019s the game plan right now.\u201d\n\nEsper refused to confirm whether U.S. special forces would conduct counterterrorism operations from Iraq into Syria but said that countering ISIS was one of his top concerns. He also said he will talk with other allies at a NATO meeting in the coming week to discuss future strategy.", "description": "Secretary of Defense Mark Esper explained the rationale behind relocating 700 troops from Syria to western Iraq.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Jim Geraghty", "Mona Charen", "David French", "William Z.
