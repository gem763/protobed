He\u2019ll also be on the sideline.\n\nThe Giants are sixth overall draft pick Daniel Jones\u2019 team now. The rookie has played pretty well, winning his first two starts after New York lost its first two games with Manning behind center. The future appears pretty clear for Manning, the team\u2019s starter since midway in the 2004 season.\n\nTom Brady, who at 42 appears to have many more years at New England\u2019s QB in store, was asked about Manning\u2019s current situation.\n\n\u201cHow I want it to end? Oh man. I think I\u2019ve had a great career,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s an Eli question, so Eli\u2019s been a great player and great for that organization. We\u2019ve had great battles against their team, certainly in big moments. They\u2019ve got us in the big moments, unfortunately, but they deserved it.\n\n\u201cEli\u2019s played great. He\u2019s been a great player for that organization, for the team. I think his teammates - he\u2019s got the respect of all those guys, and that\u2019s what you play for. You play for the respect of your teammates and your coaches. They know what you put into it. They know what it means to you. They can feel it. I mean, he\u2019s had an incredible career.\u201d\n\nOne last go at the Patriots might\u2019ve been intriguing, but barring an injury to Jones, it won\u2019t happen Thursday. The top-ranked Patriots in AP Pro32 are 15\u00bd-point favorites over the Eli-less Giants.\n\nBEST BET: PATRIOTS, 37-13\n\nKNOCKOUT POOL: Singing \u201cFly Eagles Fly\u201d kept us going for another week, now we\u2019ll drive down I-95 a bit and visit BALTIMORE.\n\nNo. 28 Atlanta (minus 2 1-2) at No. 27 Arizona\n\nRight now, Pro Picks sees no reason to go with fading Falcons.\n\nUPSET SPECIAL: CARDINALS, 22-18\n\nNo. 9 Philadelphia (plus 3) at No. 13 Minnesota\n\nWas tempted to make Eagles our Upset Special.
