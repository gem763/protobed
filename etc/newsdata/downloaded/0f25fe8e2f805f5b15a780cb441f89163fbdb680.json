Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, and four of his Democratic colleagues, have threatened the Supreme Court with \u201crestructuring\u201d if it doesn\u2019t \u201cheal\u201d itself. Basically, they\u2019re flirting with court-packing.\n\nTo the members of the Supreme Court, especially the politically sensitive Chief Justice John Roberts, we say: Ignore this nonsense. And to the legal establishment, we ask: Where is your outrage?\n\nWhitehouse\u2019s threat-bearing amicus brief is part of the Left\u2019s broader strategy to politicize the judicial process. In their view, any decision that does not serve their interests is, de facto, illegitimate. Thus, for example, a decision in favor of so-called \u201ccorporate interests\u201d cannot possibly be what the law requires but must have been driven by the judge\u2019s personal political agenda.\n\n\u201cRestructuring\u201d is a particularly slick example of misdirection. The structure of the Supreme Court, or the judiciary more broadly, is obviously not the problem. The problem, for the Left at least, is that the courts \u2014 whatever their structure \u2014 aren\u2019t delivering the political results they desire often enough. So, Whitehouse and his cohorts suggest \u201cchanges\u201d they believe will produce more favorable results.\n\nSome have suggested, for example, increasing the number of justices on the Supreme Court, rotating justices on and off in some way, or imposing term limits on federal judges. One left-wing group, Demand Justice, insists that the next Democratic president should refuse to appoint anyone who has ever been a partner at a large law firm to a federal court.\n\nEach of these proposals aims to manipulate the judiciary in order to control judicial decisions. We\u2019ve been here before, and it won\u2019t end well.\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt threatened to \u201c restructure \u201d the Supreme Court when it struck down parts of his New Deal. While his legislative proposal to \u201cpack\u201d the court failed, some historians believe that his threat pressured one or two justices (enough to obtain a majority) to begin supporting Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal initiatives.\n\nIt is worth noting that Roosevelt did end up packing the Supreme Court, he just did it the old-fashioned way. Replacing eight of the nine justices in just five years, he created a court willing to take liberties with the Constitution and statutes.\n\nIt is essential to the health of our republic that the current justices rise above the political fray. As Judge Robert Bork wrote , the court \u201cmust be controlled by principles exterior to the will of the Justices\u201d otherwise \u201cthere is no reason any of us should obey it.\u201d\n\nThis is what the \u201crule of law\u201d actually means. History shows that when judges decide cases not on principle but on political compromise, they feed political unrest.\n\nIronically, the oath of office required by federal law commits judges to decide cases \u201cimpartially\u201d and without regard to the identity of the parties: the opposite of what Whitehouse and his ilk are demanding. Hopefully, the justices will remain committed to their duty to, as Chief Justice John Roberts put it, \u201c call balls and strikes .\u201d\n\nBut that will not be enough. The judiciary\u2019s commitment to its independence means that judges cannot enter this political fray and actively defend themselves. Instead, the legal profession must step up to the plate and defend the independence and impartiality of the judiciary. Yet, the legal establishment has remained largely silent in the wake of this recent wave of attacks on the court.\n\nIt was not always so.\n\nIn 1996, for example, the American Bar Association was so concerned about political pressure on the courts that it created a commission and a standing committee on judicial independence . What was the threat back then? The ABA commission highlighted supposedly \u201cinappropriate criticism.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the ABA declared that judicial independence was \u201cin peril\u201d and asked its members: \u201cAre we doing enough to help?\u201d Recognizing that the judiciary cannot defend itself from political attacks, a top official asserted that \u201c[t]he organized bar has to talk about what judges do and defend to the death what the Third Brach of government does.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the ABA again called on lawyers to defend the judiciary against \u201cunjust criticism.\u201d It went on to say that, when the judiciary is attacked, \u201cwe must respond on our own as promptly as possible, especially in today\u2019s world of instant communication through social media.\u201d\n\nJust one month ago, the ABA defended the judiciary against attacks by President Trump. ABA President Linda Klein condemned Trump\u2019s criticism of judges as \u201c attacks on our Constitution .\u201d The association then convened a panel of judges at its annual meeting to discuss Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to \u201cundermine the courts.\u201d\n\nIf the legal establishment nonetheless thinks that mere criticism (intemperate or otherwise) threatens judicial independence, why isn\u2019t it up in arms about the Left\u2019s attacks on the court\u2019s \u201c legitimacy \u201d and threats of \u201crestructuring\u201d the judiciary itself?\n\nThreats from the likes of Whitehouse are far more serious than anything tried in the past. If the legal establishment means what it says, and wants to preserve its own credibility, it\u2019s time to step up and condemn the Democrats\u2019 flirtation with court-packing once and for all.", "description": "Sen.
