Prosecutors allege the accounts staged political rallies in the U.S. and posted content disparaging to former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during what the government has assessed to be a broad attack from Russia against various elements of the U.S. electoral system and the Clinton campaign.\n\nThe Justice Department unsealed an indictment in early 2018 charging counts of criminal conspiracy against Concord and the Internet Research Agency, as well as their alleged mastermind, Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, a related company and several other individuals implicated in their operations.\n\nAmerican lawyers representing Concord pleaded not guilty to all counts on the company\u2019s behalf in May 2018.\n\nA total of 34 individuals and entities were criminally charged as a result of the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the 2016 election, which was led by former special counsel Robert Mueller and lasted nearly two years prior to ending this past March.\n\nOthers charged as a result of Mr. Mueller\u2019s probe include several former members of Mr. Trump\u2019s election campaign, as well as the president\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the president\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Cohen pleaded guilty and is in prison, and Flynn pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nConcord will not be the next defendant from the special counsel probe to stand trial, however. Proceedings for Roger Stone, Mr. Trump\u2019s indicted former campaign adviser, are currently scheduled to start next month in D.C. He has been charged with obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and perjury and has pleaded not guilty to all counts.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
