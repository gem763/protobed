It wasn\u2019t. Maybe he made a mistake. Maybe he was confused. We don\u2019t know. But he was wrong.\u201d\n\nNoting that the president has since spent days using \u201cfake visual aids\u201d to prove he was right all along, Smith then pointed out that the whole kerfuffle began on Sunday morning when the president erroneously said on Twitter (and in comments later that day) that Alabama was in danger of getting hit by the storm.\n\n\u201cThat was wrong,\u201d Smith stated, explaining that Trump\u2019s goof was serious enough to warrant a correction by the National Weather Service at the time.\n\nThe Fox News anchor, who is known for his methodical fact-checks of the president, went on to highlight Trump\u2019s refusal to admit his mistake which climaxed with him flashing a doctored hurricane map during a White House briefing on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhy would the president of the United States do this?\u201d Smith wondered aloud. \u201cHe decries fake news that isn\u2019t and disseminates fake news that is. Think China pays the tariffs. The wall is going up. Historic inauguration crowds. The Russia probe was a witch hunt. You need an ID to buy cereal. Noise from windmills causes cancer. It\u2019s endless!\u201d\n\nAfter highlighting Trump saying he didn\u2019t know how the hurricane map was altered with a Sharpie, Smith pointed out that the president later shared a forecast on Twitter from August 28 that showed a potential path to Alabama.\n\n\u201cThis is where one where he could apologize and move on,\u201d the Fox anchor exclaimed. \u201cThat map was from the day the hurricane became a hurricane. Eight days ago. August 28. It was four days old at the precise time he said Alabama would likely be hit harder than anticipated. By then, it was fake news defined on a very serious subject.\u201d\n\nSmith would then bring on White House correspondent John Roberts, who gave the White House\u2019s latest explanation for how Trump ended up sharing an outdated and altered hurricane map, stating that the map had been left in the Oval Office after a briefing and had been written on by someone during the meeting.", "description": "\u201cSome things in Trumplandia are inexplicable,\u201d an exasperated Shep said Thursday.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567716931/shepard-smith-reporting_12_nujs46", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
