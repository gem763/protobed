Government agencies receive an estimated 3m hours of free labor, replacing 1,800 jobs.\n\nPeople struggle to complete their work by imposed deadlines, and in criminal court, nearly one in five people sentenced to community service ultimately face a probation violation or arrest warrant as a result.\n\nWhile community service is supposed to be an alternative to debt, most criminal defendants are still forced to make payments averaging $323. People also often have to \u201cpay to work for free\u201d through initial fees to receive their community service referrals, which can be more than $100.\n\nIn traffic court, which sentences people to community service for minor infractions, 89% of defendants are people of color.\n\nThe new paper, the first in-depth study of these kinds of sentences in the US, presents court-ordered service as a type of legal coercion and labor exploitation, comparable to wage theft. While community service has traditionally been considered a progressive alternative to imprisonment, in LA county, which has the largest jail system in the world, it\u2019s a punishment that exacerbates inequality and creates an unregulated labor force where workers are vulnerable to abuse, the authors said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A city worker cleans up trash on 20 November 2015 in Los Angeles.

Community service has received little scrutiny but operates in a similar manner by creating work mandates for people who can\u2019t pay fees for traffic infractions or other offenses, Zatz said.\n\nWhile defendants sentenced to labor are generally considered \u201cvolunteers\u201d with few rights, they are also frequently assigned to positions alongside paid workers, sometimes manual labor such as graffiti removal, trash pickup and janitorial work. In LA, people most often work for places like CalTrans, the state transit agency, local parks and municipal departments, Goodwill, the Salvation Army and local community centers.\n\nIf they experience discrimination, sexual harassment, abuse, injuries or other forms of mistreatment on the job, they have few options, the researchers noted.\n\n\u201cGet to work or go to jail\u201d is a looming threat, which means workers struggle to speak up, said Tia Koonse, the legal and policy research manager at the UCLA Labor Center. \u201cIt has a chilling effect on asking for accommodations, asking for a meal or bathroom break, asking for your rights.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for LA county courts and a local agency involved in community service placement declined to comment.\n\nSelena Lopez, 24, said she was forced to do service at a community center as punishment for a misdemeanor case in 2016. At the time, her father had been deported and her mother had died, and she was struggling with addiction, leading to minor run-ins with the law.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Selena Lopez had to complete more than 30 days of service, which forced her to put her education on hold.

Then 21 years old, Lopez had to clean the kitchen at a not-for-profit organization and was surrounded by men who sexually harassed her, she said. The cleaning fluids she was using also made her sick, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a situation that is not good for my health, that is not safe for me,\u201d she said, recalling that when she complained to supervisors, they threatened to revoke her hours or say she didn\u2019t complete her mandatory service. \u201cI had to choose \u2013 do I get this done, or walk away and lose everything?\u201d\n\nLopez had to complete more than 30 days of service, which forced her to put her education on hold.\n\n\u201cDo I want to be in school or do I want to be in jail? I had this haunting me everyday,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIs community service doing good out here, or is it causing more harm?\u201d\n\nThe UCLA report cited anecdotes of community service workers facing verbal and physical harassment harassment, with one saying \u201cthey treat people like trash\u201d, and another reporting a male supervisor inappropriately touching women.\n\nThe authors recommend that the courts reduce the threats of jail and debt that force people into service jobs in the first place, noting that traffic stops and other policing of low-level offenses are plagued by racial profiling. They also support other sentencing alternatives that don\u2019t rely on forced labor and argue that if punitive community service is used, it should lead to paid jobs and opportunities meant to help people.\n\nLopez, who is now studying communications and an advocate for the rights of incarcerated people, said people caught up in the system are \u201ctrying to make our wrongs right\u201d and need support, not unpaid jobs. She said she hoped more people speak up: \u201cI know I\u2019m not the only one. There are so many people going through this.\u201d", "description": "Exclusive: study finds county relies on laborers \u2013 largely people of color \u2013 threatened with debts and jail to do work that would otherwise be paid", "authors": ["Sam Levin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d600e3c410cc01cadaa4d87d5c681e9c59a081bf/0_173_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c28bccb32dba51d176ec5c5f5b6d6c04", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
