John, 70, said \u201cthere is opportunity for more than 50 [branches] to be added\u201d in the next five years.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe do think the high street has a future and there\u2019s a future for face-to-face interaction. Take our cruises \u2013 very little gets booked online and also long-haul and travelling to more exotic places.\u201d\n\nSunderland-based Hays has already reopened 210 former Thomas Cook branches and offered over 2,000 staff new jobs.\n\nAmong them are branch workers Gemma Critchlow, 35, and Nicola Callaghan, 42, who said it was a huge relief to find her job had been saved.", "description": "John and Irene Hays made the decision as the heads of independent holiday firm Hays Travel", "authors": ["Graham Hiscott"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650491.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS195923110.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
