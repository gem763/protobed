Funny, isn\u2019t it, to imply that the webathon raised . . . when in fact the success here is due to you donating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut are you part of that you? As of today, 1,746 good friends \u2014 of conservatism, of free speech (yes, part of our needs include funds to fight National Review v. Mann, which we hope the Supreme Court will agree to take up) \u2014 have seen fit to contribute. We really need that many more (because, truth be told, our actual needs dwarf the webathon goal of $275,000) to join in this effort. We say it because we believe it: No one has an iota of obligation to NR. But then there is this: People who enjoy NR regularly are able to do such because other people have seen fit to support the institution, to empower it to continue publishing amazing commentary, wisdom, and analysis.\n\nAre you, pardon the French, an NR junkie? Okay, that\u2019s not French, but regardless of the language, are you? Do you abide here, day in and out, taking seconds and thirds and tenths from the free all-you-can-eat bar? If you are, you really do have to admit that you owe something to the past donors who are affording you the ability to be an intellectual glutton on NRO. So we ask, especially to you who are frequent flyers here, to donate. And if you need some inspiration, read about these kind donors and their motivations:\n\nBlessed we are to have a pal such as Norm from La Mesa, Calif., who donates a suhweeeet $1,000 and admits to a long friendship: \u201cNR is a first line of defense against many of the evils that confound our country. I have been a proud supporter for 40 years and eleven cruises and consider the crew at NR and NR Institute comrades and friends.\u201d\n\nFrom Wannanup in the land down under comes $500 courtesy of Tamera, who stuffs it into our tucker bag and, while waiting for her billy to boil, explains: \u201cI have dual American/Australian citizenship. I have lived in Australia for 18 years. My husband and I vote absentee ballots for USA elections. Thank you for all you do to keep us informed.\u201d We\u2019ll come waltzing with you, Tamera!\n\nFrom Springville, Utah, the great Elizabeth tenders $500 in kindness and admits to a habit: \u201cI greatly appreciate all you do. I am an NR junkie. You are so essential.\u201d Only because you have our back. Thanks!\n\nRichard from El Paso sends Ben Franklin our way and shows he is not afraid to share an opinion: \u201cI am making this contribution so you can help defend MY freedom of speech. Regardless of which side of the \u2018Climate Change\u2019 argument you are on it is your right to speak your mind. Our First Amendment rights need to be flexed from time to time to prove that point. When this case is overturned by the Supreme Court, I hope you counter-sue for all they have! Including those that funded this shameful travesty.\u201d Thanks, sir, very much. Let\u2019s pray that SCOTUS accepts our petition first.\n\nBrian from Denver sends the same and gives a good reason why NR merits such: \u201cI really think this is the best publication out there. Stories are always well argued and presented and opposing views are also tolerated. Maybe I enjoy reading your stories because I agree with you so often, who really knows. But you are a valued and necessary voice in the ongoing debate.\u201d Wisely and kindly said, Brian. Go Broncos!\n\nJeffrey from Valencia, Calif., spots us $50 and reveals a longstanding friendship: \u201c National Review has been my go-to source for the best expression of conservative values and thought since the 1980s, when I was in high school. Thanks for all you do. Your work makes a positive difference.\u201d Important to know that you feel that way, and important you know that happens because we have such selfless friends.\n\nhas been my go-to source for the best expression of conservative values and thought since the 1980s, when I was in high school. Thanks for all you do. Your work makes a positive difference.\u201d Important to know that you feel that way, and important you know that happens because we have such selfless friends. Michael from Wallingford, Penn, also send $50 and fessed up that his kindness was overdue: \u201cI visit the webpage everyday now \u2014 way past time that I contribute.\u201d We are so glad you did. Means more than you can imagine.\n\nRandall from Spokane, Wash., sees fit to contribute $100. And here\u2019s why: \u201cI appreciate that your writing has managed to stay intellectual and accurate, while so many news sources are emotionally invested in their news coverage, making it hard to trust.\u201d Love the kindness here, Randall, material and spiritual.\n\nKaren from Sun City, Ariz., fills the tip jar with a fifty and slaps NR\u2019s back: \u201cFor the invaluable work you do I wish I could be more generous. Thank you for consistently thoughtful and intellectually challenging contributions to the conversations regarding some of the most important issues of our day.\u201d From where we stand, Karen, this is pretty darned generous. Many thanks.\n\nCan you see fit to donating $25, $50, or $100? There are some (you?) who truly can do more: $250, or $500 \u2014 if you can, please do. And then there is that cruiser-weight class of contributors who can send NR $1,000, or even $5,000, or even $10,000 (one kind couple has!). Donate here. And if you\u2019re wondering if that donation tax-deductible, well, it\u2019s not. But then neither are political contributions, if that\u2019s any solace. Solace aside, here\u2019s the reality: We\u2019re engaged in hand-to-hand combat on behalf of free speech. We need you alongside us. Thanks in advance for your support, and one last thing: If you prefer to send a check, make one payable to \u201cNational Review\u201d and mail it to National Review, ATTN: 2019 Fall Webathon, 19 West 44th Street, Suite 1701, New York, NY 10036.\n\nP.S.: Your generous contribution supports the journalism, commentary, and opinion writing published in National Review magazine and on National Review Online.
