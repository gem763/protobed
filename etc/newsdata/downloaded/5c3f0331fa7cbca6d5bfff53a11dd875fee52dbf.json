And my numbers went down to the equivalent of a normal human being who does not have pancreatic cancer,\" he said. \"So we were all very optimistic. And they said, 'Good, we're gonna stop chemo, we'll start you on immunotherapy.\"\n\nHe then revealed things got worse. \"I lost about 12 pounds in a week. And my numbers went sky high, much higher than they were when I was first diagnosed,\" he shared. \"So, the doctors have decided that I have to undergo chemo again and that's what I'm doing.\"\n\nThe host said he is struggling to be a source of positivity to people who are also fighting the disease, in a CTV interview earlier in October.\n\n\"A lot of people are coming to me and looking for help, reassurance, and that\u2019s tough,\" he shared, adding that it's difficult, \"trying to be as optimistic as you can when the other person feels none of that. \u2026 They feel only despair.\"\n\nTrebek also told CTV that during his battle, he will, \"play it by ear and keep chugging along until we either win or lose.\"", "description": "Jeopardy!", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/alex-trebek-gty-aa-191030_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
