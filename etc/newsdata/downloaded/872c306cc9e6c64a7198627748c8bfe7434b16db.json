The contemptuous manner in which Boris Johnson dismissed others MPs\u2019 distress and fears of death threats as \u201chumbug\u201d was unusually offensive, even by his standards.\n\nIt was ludicrous for him to make out that the best way to honour Jo Cox\u2019s memory would be to \u201cget Brexit done\", breathtaking in its audacity, and the emotional responses to that remark were visceral. After all, Jo Cox was assassinated while campaigning for Remain during the 2016 referendum \u2013 and event which, for a time, stopped the clock.\n\nHer widower has appealed for some calm, and for everyone to recall Jo's abiding testament: \u201cWe are far more united, and have far more in common with each other, than things that divide us\u201d. He regrets that the Brexit debate has descended into a \u201cbear pit of polarisation\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBrendan is right about that, but the political polarisation he refers to \u2013 and the exploitation of it \u2013 is quite deliberate, and has not yet peaked. Johnson will see to that.\n\nThe polarisation of the debate is intensified by the prime minister all the better to mobilise his own \u201cbase\u201d of support: increasingly embittered and frustrated Leavers. He wants them to turn out and vote for him on some dank evening in November. He wants to get them angry.\n\nThus, he actively wants to be seen battling with parliament \u2013 and especially opposition MPs \u2013 in the name of \u201cthe people\u201d; that is, Leavers. The optics, as they say, suits him fine.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. How the papers covered Johnson\u2019s return to parliament Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

If he thought he could get any traction with it, no doubt he\u2019d chuck the Queen under the bus as well.\n\n\u201cDog whistle\u201d politics are nothing new for the man who used to write about \u201cpicanninies\" with \"watermelon smiles\u201d and Muslim women wearing \u201cletter box\u201d veils. He knows what he is doing, and what he has been doing for some time now is following the ruthless advice of Dominic Cummings and Lynton Crosby. Their trade is division and their currency hate. When a turbaned Labour MP, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, savaged the PM in the Commons for his racism, a lot of Johnson\u2019s supporters would take Johnson\u2019s side. Liberals have to realise that.\n\nSo when Brendan Cox, and well-meaning figures such as Amber Rudd and Stephen Kinnock, start talking about reaching out, building consensus and reaching compromise they have Johnson\u2019s electoral tactics plain wrong.\n\nOn Brexit \u2013 as John Curtice as pointed out, and the current atmosphere also speaks for itself \u2013 there is no middle ground to appeal to in the traditional Left-Centre-Right spectrum of conventional politics. The bell curve has been replaced by twin peaks; the votes are found in the extremes (and that is one reason why Labour's Brexit compromises fail to get much support).\n\nThis is a polarised culture war. The only way to win a war like that is to make the other side as angry as your own side in a sort of perverse process of political symbiosis. You need to start fires, and watch them spread.\n\nSeeing Johnson wind up the Remainers and insult these venerable justices and flail the \u201csurrender act\u201d, the \u201ccollaborators\u201d, \u201ctraitors\u201d and Brussels is just what he needs to recruit these voters \u2013 many of them Labour, ex-Labour, ex-Ukip or Brexit party sympathisers \u2013 into the Conservative camp. The politics of division thrives on discord and division. It abhors harmony and enjoys the insult.\n\nBrendan Cox wishes us to believe that Johnson is not \u201cevil\u201d, which is admittedly not exactly lavish praise, but then again Johnson is not exactly St Francis of Assisi either. The short word for it is \u201cpopulism\u201d.\n\nWelcome, in other words, to the new politics. Remind you of anyone?\n\nObviously Johnson, more or less self-consciously, seeks to be the British Trump, or, as Trump once put it himself, \u201cBritain Trump\u201d. Both men like to have the last word, enjoy upsetting their moments, insult anyone and any institution that gets in the way, double down when they are criticised or attacked, and never, ever apologise or show contrition. They never display \u201cweakness\u201d \u2013 or, I should clarify, what they regard as weakness.\n\nThe lies flow from the pair of them as they rarely have before in modern political life. When they are checked by opposition politicians (including those in their own parties), or by the \u201cmainstream media\u201d or even by independent regulatory bodies, the response is mainly to attack the motivations and interests of those involved.\n\nJohnson would like to be as good at this as Nigel Farage already is, and the prime minister has all the advantages of incumbency to bring to bear on that task. He has also gathered round him a gang of like-minded men and women, some of whom (Nicky Morgan, for example) should really know better.\n\nSo bring on the court cases in DC and Westminster, and the parallel threats of impeachment.\n\nBring on the accusations of personal impropriety, the mixing of private interests and public money, and the accusations of collusion.\n\nBring on the fussy talk about independent judges and the rights of a free press, and an effective legislative opposition.\n\nThey can all be vanquished in the name of the majority, the mandate of the \u201cthe people\u201d. In both cases it is narrow or non-existent; Trump, after all, lost the US popular vote and no longer controls Congress. Johnson was elected by approximately 90,000 Tory activists, and has never led his party into a general election. Since he has been prime minister he his majority in the house of Commons (so no wonder he thinks it a \u201czombie\u201d, though it is anything but in practice).\n\nNo matter the 52 per cent to the electorate who voted for Leave have been co-opted, willingly or not, into an increasingly radicalised army of populist revolt, who are supposed to want (every single one of them) a no-deal Brexit if necessary, even though they have never been explicitly asked that. They are supposed to believe that they are in a war to save Britain. Hence all the militaristic language. If someone was brave enough to remind Johnson that Jo Cox died at the hands of a man yelling \u201cBritain first\u201d and \u201ckeep Britain independent\u201d he would throw the words back in their face as \u201chumbug\u201d or some such.\n\nThere is nothing, in fact, that Johnson would not rather than to be arrested for breaking the Benn Act when he refuses to request the article 50 extension from the European Union that he is required to by law to seek. Far from being ashamed to be the first serving premier to have his collar felt by the boys in blue outside Downing Street, he would be delighted. He would get the cameras in to witness every moment of the court order being served. He would then declare himself Britain\u2019s first \u201cBrexit martyr\u201d (with no hint of irony about Jo Cox). He would clown around, and his base would love it. The more of the 52 per cent of 2016 they can convert into Tory voters, the better.\n\nYou cannot trust this man. If he is not evil, then there must be some the other word for him. In any case, don\u2019t raise to the bait, and don\u2019t give him his early People vs Parliament election.", "description": "No one listening to Brendan Cox\u2019s interview\u00a0on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning could fail to be touched by what he was saying about the way\u00a0Jo Cox\u2019s name and memory has been used and abused in the House of Commons.
