The union said it was paying a portion of his legal fees.\n\nKraus said there was \u201cabsolutely no excuse\u201d for Jefferson\u2019s death and said she had every right to defend herself under Texas law.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense she would have a gun if she felt threatened or if there was someone in the backyard,\u201d an emotional Kraus said, adding that her death had \u201ceroded the trust we have built with the community.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Fort Worth Police Department officer Aaron York Dean is seen in a booking photo at the Tarrant County Jail in Fort Worth, Texas, U.S. October 14, 2019.
