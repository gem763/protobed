They\u2019re all my own, dear.\u201d\n\nThe nation \u2013 not to mention Craig \u2013 cringed. I, however, rejoiced. Finally, proof that these kind of moments do happen to other people, not just me.\n\nUnfortunately, my pleasure was short-lived, because Teethgate then made me remember the very worst times I\u2019d put my foot in it.\n\nIn no particular order...\n\nARRGGHH 1\n\nOne of my neighbours asked if they did work \u00adexperience at a place I worked.\n\nI needed to ask who for, but was desperate not to offend her, so decided to err on the side of caution.\n\nUnfortunately I accidentally erred on the wrong side, and said: \u201cIs it for your granddaughter?\u201d\n\nIt was for her daughter. She was incredibly offended, and quite cross. I was mortified, especially as I\u2019d been trying my best to do exactly the opposite of what had transpired.\n\nSo I tried to dig myself out by saying nowadays kids sometimes did work experience in infant school, a lie she didn\u2019t believe for a second, but which I had to keep going for the next eight years until she moved away.\n\nCan\u2019t think why.\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\nARRGGHH 2\n\nI was early to pick my son up from nursery one day, so stood with another mum chatting, watching all the other parents arrive and walk towards us.\n\nA man I\u2019d never seen before, dressed in a pair of shorts, long socks and sandals, came through the gate and I laughed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bold look!\u201d I sniggered to the other mum.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my husband,\u201d she replied. This time though, I thought quickly.\n\n\u201cNo, not him,\u201d I said, much too fast, \u201cThe, er, old bloke behind him.\u201d\n\nShe almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 looked sorry for me as she said: \u201cAnd that\u2019s my dad.\u201d\n\nARRGGHH 3\n\nVisiting a friend\u2019s new house, she proudly showed me her daughter\u2019s bedroom. \u201cOh that\u2019s so sweet that you let her paint it herself,\u201d I exclaimed, so enthusiastically it was impossible to pretend I\u2019d been joking a moment later, when I very much wanted to.\n\nARRGGHH 4\n\nWhen kids blurt out rude things they are instantly forgiven, because they don\u2019t know any better, and the results are often quite funny.\n\nI\u2019d been at someone else\u2019s house when their son had gleefully informed one of the women in the room: \u201cYou\u2019ve got massive feet!\u201d\n\nI was telling a friend about it, and explained: \u201cIn his defence, they were enormous, like a size 9 or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a size 9,\u201d said my friend.\n\nI brilliantly countered this by saying: \u201cNo you\u2019re not\u201d \u2013 thereby accusing her of not knowing her own shoe size, ie literally adding insult to injury.\n\nARRGGHH 5\n\nOne of my friends is an actress and she was in a play, so I went along to support her. Please note the good intention, I beg of you.\n\nShe was playing a character who was five months pregnant, so had to wear padding and a fake bump while on stage.\n\nAfterwards we all met for a drink in the pub next door to the theatre, and I greeted her far too loudly by asking if she\u2019d gone all method actor now, because why was she still wearing the padding?\n\nDo I really need to tell you her reply?\n\nThought not.", "description": "Mirror columnist Polly Hudson reveals her most cringe-worthy moments", "authors": ["Polly Hudson", "Image", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20531654.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_for-polly.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
