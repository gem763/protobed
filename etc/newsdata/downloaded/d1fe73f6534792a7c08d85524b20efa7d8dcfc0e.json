The small team of game developers discussed what made geese so amusing.\n\nWas it their \"crazy\" colouring? Their \"frowning\" faces? Perhaps simply their \"honking noise\"?\n\nThey decided to make the creature the star of their next game, and posted a teaser video on YouTube.\n\n\"We had very little expectation of attention,\" says Jake Strasser from the House House studio.\n\n\"Within a matter of hours we knew that something was up. The video had been watched maybe half a million times. The retweets started pouring in. We hit the number one spot on Reddit that night. We hadn't realised what was on our hands.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The developers joked about geese in their group chat\n\nThis early social media attention undoubtedly gave the goose a lift. In the crowded games market, having all the ingredients of a hit does not always guarantee success.\n\n\"There's just too many games coming out, and some people who are making amazing games need to know how to sell them as well,\" says Mike Rose, director of a rival indie games publisher, No More Robots.\n\n\"If you can get across the concept of your game in the form of a pictures or simple phrase, then you're on to a winner.\"\n\nIn Untitled Goose Game, the player assumes the role of a horrible goose and terrorises the inhabitants of a sleepy English village.\n\nThere is no motive other than causing mischief, which Nico Disseldorp, who worked on Untitled Goose Game, credits with capturing gamers' interest.\n\n\"I think the goose character allows people to be this source of mischief that lots of people desire being in video games,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"No matter what the game is, you find a certain kind of player will look for ways of making mischief. They may even ignore the story that's been laid out for them, to go and do something mischievous instead. In this game, you're told to go in there and make as big a mess as possible.\"\n\nImage copyright House House Image caption Objective: steal the groundkeeper's keys\n\nThe game has been compared to the Hitman series, in which assassin Agent 47 concocts elaborate schemes to takes out his targets.\n\nMr Disseldorp says the team \"definitely drew a lot from Hitman games\", but not always intentionally.\n\n\"We wanted the small moments of mischief and gradually gravitated towards stealth games where the player might know things that other characters on the screen don't know. We realised it was very rich for the kinds of comedic moments that we were trying to add to our game,\" he said.\n\nMr Strasser says the format of an assassination in Hitman is similar to a prank or a joke: \"It has a set-up and a punchline. By removing the violence from it, we just let the situations exist as a joke.\"\n\nAnother key ingredient in a hit game is a strong protagonist, and Mr Disseldorp says geese stood out for being \"expressive\" and full of attitude.\n\n\"We don't really have geese in our lives here in urban Melbourne. But we realised that people who live near geese have this very particular relationship with them, they're often very afraid of geese and that seems very strange to us,\" he explains. \"The relationship that people have with geese seems to be almost like the relationship you would have with a person you don't like.\"\n\nImage copyright House House Image caption Objective: lock the wimpy kid in a phone booth\n\nAlthough the developers are based in Australia, they set the game in a quiet English village, which they describe as a \"natural habitat\" for the bird.\n\n\"There's something about the kind of properness of an English village that seems to be the antithesis of what the goose was all about. If the goose was going to be chaotic and making a mess, then the natural foil seemed to be these people who wanted to preserve order,\" says Mr Disseldorp.\n\nWhat did the villagers do to deserve their torment? Nothing, he says.\n\n\"The goose isn't morally righteous. The goose sits outside of human morality. They aren't causing trouble because it's the right thing to do... they're doing it because they're a goose.\"\n\nVideos of the mischief-making bird were \"perfect social media fodder,\" says Mr Rose, which helped spread the word about the game.\n\n\"I say to so many developers, that the the social media and marketing is just as important as the actual making of the game,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"You see amazing games come out every single week that get barely any sales, because they didn't do a good enough job of actually sharing it around and promoting the game.\"\n\nBut he said House House had created a \"perfect\" game for sharing on social media.\n\n\"Not many people would scroll past a video of a goose being horrible on Twitter.\"\n\nThe social media response also helped the team decide not to name their game.\n\nThe first teaser uploaded to YouTube was simply called Untitled Goose Game, and fans embraced it as an official title.\n\nMr Strasser says the only other contender for a name was Some Like It Honk.\n\nWhen he mentions the name, Strasser and Disseldorp giggle.\n\n\"It wasn't viable,\" Mr Strasser explains.\n\nImage copyright House House Image caption Objective: stealing the washing\n\nSo, now the game is out, has it lived up to the hype?\n\nReviews have been generally favourable, although some critics say the game is too short and some of the puzzles too obtuse.\n\nMr Disseldorp says the team was not too concerned with the length of the game, which can be completed in one sitting.\n\n\"We knew from the beginning that we wanted the player to progress through this village. We knew the kinds of moments and characters we wanted to have,\" says Mr Disseldorp.\n\n\"When we got people to our office, we started timing how long it took them to play and they seemed to take about four hours, on average. It seems now the game is out, some people are playing it faster than that. But when it comes to the games that we play, we don't really worry if it's short or long. I think it's really nice that people can play to the end of this thing without spending their life on it.\"\n\nAs well as countless memes, fans have offered suggestions for what they would like to see in the game. But the team says it is too early to think about a sequel.\n\n\"Right now we're still looking at the next patch for the game to fix a few bugs,\" says Mr Disseldorp.\n\n\"It's taken everything we had to get us to this point, so we haven't been in the background concocting a sequel just yet.\"", "description": "An indie video game about a menacing goose has become a surprise hit.", "authors": ["Chris Fox", "Technology Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12B60/production/_109004667_02untitledgoosegamescreen3840x2160.png"}
