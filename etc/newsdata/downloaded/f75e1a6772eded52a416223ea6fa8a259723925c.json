So, not surprisingly, when researchers examined modern-day relatives of dinosaurs \u2013 birds and reptiles \u2013 they found that evaporation of moisture in the nose, mouth and eyes cooled blood on its way to the brain.\n\nThe investigators used 3D imaging of fossils to reveal multiple heat exchangers in dinosaur heads.\n\nLead author Ruger Porter, an assistant professor of anatomical instruction, said, \"The handy thing about blood vessels is that they basically write their presence into the bones. The bony canals and grooves that we see in modern-day birds and reptiles are our link to the dinosaur fossils. We can use this bony evidence to restore the patterns of blood flow in extinct dinosaurs and hopefully get a glimpse into their thermal physiology and how they dealt with heat.\"\n\nThe study was published in the journal Anatomical Record.\n\nSharon Swartz of the National Science Foundation, which funded the research, said the findings show how the physical constraints imposed by specific environmental conditions shaped dinosaurs' evolution.\n\n\"Using a combination of technological innovation and biological expertise, these researchers were able to take a direct reading from the fossil record that provides new clues about how dinosaur skeletal form and function evolved,\" she said.\n\nImage credit: unsplash.com\n\n", "description": "When researchers examined modern-day relatives of dinosaurs \u2013 birds and reptiles \u2013 they found how blood was cooled on its way to the brain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9487/5af940bb204b439f8e5aeeb58c9f4801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
