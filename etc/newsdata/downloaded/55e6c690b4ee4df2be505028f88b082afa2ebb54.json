In the photo, the couple is backed by the haunting glow of the Kincade fire that has been ablaze since last Wednesday.\n\nKarna Roa/KMR Photography Katie and Curtis Ferland.\n\nRoa \u2014 who told HuffPost that she\u2019s had four weddings affected by wildfire in the past three years \u2014 had some ominous thoughts while snapping the shot.\n\n\u201cThe image was created in the style of the 1930s painting American Gothic,\u201d she said. \u201cThe original painting by Grant Wood depicted the normal life in 1930 in the United States. As the couple stood in the vineyard with masks I wondered if this was the \u2018new normal\u2019 for the California Wine Country in 2019.\u201d\n\nKarna Roa/KMR Photography Karna Roa\n\nThe looming fire that blazed near Kenwood had quite an impact on the Ferlands\u2019 wedding.\n\nThe couple\u2019s rehearsal dinner had to be relocated to an alternative location. And although the ceremony took place outside in its intended location, due to the smoke, the wedding was moved indoors to an air-filtered reception room after the 20-minute ceremony.\n\nKarna Roa/KMR Photography The couple\u2019s ceremony backed by a smoky sunset.\n\n\u201cKenwood lost power partway through the reception,\u201d Roa told HuffPost. \u201cThe evening was kept going on generators.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, the entire town of Kenwood was forced to evacuate, so the Ferlands packed up and headed to San Francisco for a mini honeymoon.\n\nKarna Roa/KMR Photography The happy couple.\n\nThe Kincade fire in Sonoma County is affecting over 1 million people, and in many cases the circumstances are much more dire than the Ferlands\u2019. Since the fire began a week ago, thousands have been evacuated.\n\nLast Wednesday, utility company Pacific Gas & Electric cut power to over 1 million people in the region and many are still without power.\n\nInvestigators are also looking into whether PG&E equipment sparked the massive blaze in the region, though the company told regulators last week that one of its transmission towers broke near the ignition point, The Washington Post reported.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the Kincade fire had burned 76,825 acres and destroyed 206 structures, according to a tweet posted by the San Francisco Chronicle. It is currently 30% contained but is so large that NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan was able to take pictures of the fire from the International Space Station, posting them to Twitter on Wednesday.\n\nFrom @Space_Station I was able to catch these pictures of the California wildfires burning north of the Bay Area. Thinking of the people who have lost their homes and the brave first responders on the front lines protecting them. pic.twitter.com/islV3DP5yM \u2014 Andrew Morgan (@AstroDrewMorgan) October 30, 2019\n\nRoa, who is based in the wine country, hopes that her photo of the Ferlands has a broader impact.\n\nShe told local news channel KPIX5, \u201cAs long as it can bring more attention to the wildfires and the problems that Sonoma and Napa County and Northern California are facing, then I would love more people to see it.\u201d", "description": "Photographer Karna Roa captured the newlyweds from Chicago, who got married over the weekend in Sonoma County, just miles away from the Kincade fire.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db9f7d82100006f3ead4644.jpeg?cache=zxbqdcfxlx&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
