(Picture: REX)\n\nJudge Nicole Scherzinger bringing it as usual (Picture: REX)\n\nLouis explained: \u2018What we\u2019re doing this year I think is a brilliant idea. I think everyone\u2019s going to love watching these celebrities because it\u2019s not what people expect.\n\n\u2018Some of them are really good. The show feels more exciting. There\u2019s no Bootcamp, no Six-Chair Challenge, it feels slick this year.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been the best show on TV for a long time and has just had a little rebranding, I suppose, a new X Factor.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe music manager joins Simon Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger on the judges\u2019 panel.\n\nA new trailer for the show saw Simon, Nicole and Louis listening to the celebs do their thing in a luxury Hollywood venue, which we think is a fair replacement for judges\u2019 houses.\n\nReality TV star Megan, Glee\u2019s Kevin McHale, EastEnders\u2019 Jonny Labey will all be competing in the Unders category. The Overs is comprised of journalist Martin Bashir, actress Victoria Ekanoye and TV presenter Ricki.\n\nIn the groups will be a Love Island supergroup comprised of Wes Nelson, Samira Mighty, Eyal Booker and Zara McDermott. Ben Foden, Thom Evans and Levi Davis will be teaming up for a group, along with Brendan Cole and Jeremy Edwards.\n\nThe X Factor Celebrity starts Saturday at 8.35pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
