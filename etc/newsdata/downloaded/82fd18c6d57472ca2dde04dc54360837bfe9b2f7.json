But the threat of impeachment is constraining the President\u2019s power in surprising ways. As defiant witnesses provide damning testimony in the House inquiry, Republicans are increasingly seeking shelter from unrelated scandals. The result\u2013a spreading weakness in the West Wing\u2013has driven increasingly erratic behavior by Trump, according to those close to him inside the White House and outside of government.\n\nExamples of Trump\u2019s diminished power aren\u2019t hard to find. A series of government officials have defied the White House\u2019s Oct. 8 edict that the Administration would not comply with the impeachment inquiry. Most damaging so far was the Oct. 22 testimony of acting U.S. Ambassador to Kiev William Taylor tying Trump to the alleged quid pro quo at the heart of the Ukraine scandal.\n\nAmid the parade of defiance by public servants, Republican politicians are showing signs of turning on Trump. On Oct. 19, some GOP legislators sent the President a message that they wouldn\u2019t defend his decision to hold the next G-7 summit at his resort in Doral, Fla., a senior White House official says. Already angry over Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw American troops from Syria, the lawmakers were taking fire on too many fronts, they told the White House. So Trump did what he\u2019s rarely done as President: he reversed himself.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t pretty. Taking to Twitter that night, Trump blamed \u201cboth Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility\u201d for the climb down. But it\u2019s what he sees as a lack of Republican resolve that is really bothering him. During an Oct. 21 Cabinet meeting, Trump went on a wide-ranging on-camera rant that kept the press in the Cabinet Room for 72 minutes. \u201cThis is a phony investigation,\u201d Trump told the journalists. \u201cAnd Republicans have to get tougher and fight.\u201d After reporters were escorted out, Trump railed about the political limitations he feels are being imposed on him by those in his own party.\n\nThe exasperation is mutual. Many congressional Republicans are tired of seeing Trump tweet about everything except their agenda. Impeachment is consuming the political oxygen in Washington, and GOP leaders are concerned that the White House doesn\u2019t know how to manage it, according to several high-level Republican aides.\n\nTrump\u2019s own aides aren\u2019t helping. In a jaw-dropping press conference on Oct. 17, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney sought to rebut Democratic accusations that Trump had improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch investigations that would benefit Trump politically. Instead, Mulvaney acknowledged that U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been held up to press the country to cooperate with one such probe. Mulvaney later reversed himself and denied there was a quid pro quo.\n\nDemocrats are looking for ways to widen the rift that such performances are opening among Republicans, and the House inquiry is giving them plenty to work with. Taylor painted a devastating portrait of U.S. foreign policy hijacked for domestic political purposes. In a detailed 15-page statement, he described a \u201chighly irregular\u201d back-channel policy operation \u201cguided by\u201d Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. One member of that operation, Ambassador Gordon Sondland, told Taylor that Trump had insisted Zelensky publicly commit to investigating the Bidens and the 2016 election before he would release $392 million in military aid, according to Taylor\u2019s testimony.\n\nTaylor cited 50 years of public service, from his time as an infantry officer with the 101st Airborne in Vietnam to his visit to the front lines of Ukraine\u2019s ongoing war with Russia in July, in welcoming the chance to comply with the House subpoena. It was key, he said, to explain \u201cthe profound importance of Ukraine\u201d to American security and to show why \u201cholding up security assistance for domestic political gain was \u2018crazy.'\u201d Four other currently serving Trump Administration officials have complied with congressional subpoenas, and more are on the way.\n\nWill such testimony ultimately end Trump\u2019s hold on power? Hill Republican support for the President may be showing signs of softness, but 20 GOP Senators would have to defect to remove him from office in a Senate trial. Some 93% of Republicans don\u2019t believe Trump should be impeached, according to an Oct. 21 poll by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, and if those numbers hold, few if any Senate Republicans can be expected to defy their base and likely end their political careers.\n\nBut Democrats are hoping the ongoing inquiry, and Trump\u2019s own missteps, will take him down, one way or another. \u201cMost Americans would say, if you told a foreign leader to go investigate dirt on my opponent, that\u2019s bad enough,\u201d says Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat. But with a little more than a year before the 2020 election, voters, not Congress, may be the ones left to limit Trump\u2019s power.\n\n\u2013With reporting by ALANA ABRAMSON and PHILIP ELLIOTT/WASHINGTON", "description": "The threat of impeachment is constraining President Trump's power in surprising ways.
