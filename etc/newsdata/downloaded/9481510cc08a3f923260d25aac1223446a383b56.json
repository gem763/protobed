States in the West and Northeast had larger LGBT populations, while many states in the upper Great Plains and the South had a small share of LGBT-identifying adults.\n\nBusiness Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Movement Advancement Project\n\nThe Movement Advancement Project also published estimates of how many same-sex couples in each state were raising children. Those estimates were based on a Williams Institute analysis of data from the US Census, which determines family structures based on who respondents list as a spouse and as their own children in their households, rather than asking specific questions about sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nIn what might be a somewhat surprising result, some of the states with the lowest shares of self-identified LGBT adults had very high shares of same-sex couples raising children. For example, while just 2.9% of adults in Montana identified themselves as LGBT according to the above Gallup data, a full 22% of same-sex couples in that state had children.", "description": "LGBT-identifying people and their families are an essential part of America.
