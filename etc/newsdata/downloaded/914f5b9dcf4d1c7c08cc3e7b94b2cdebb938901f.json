(This includes Google Maps, Calendar, Google Drive, Google Assistant and Gmail.) Instead, it will reportedly come with third-party alternatives running on a bespoke version of Android 10. Here are the details. Read more\n\nHuawei Mate 30 release date in Australia\n\nThe Huawei Mate 30 is set to launch on 19 September in Munich, Germany. As with most phone launches, devices usually go on sale within a few weeks of announcement so we anticipate we'll see Mate 30 in stores by October. What's less clear is what exactly it will feature given Google confirmed none of its apps would appear on Huawei's devices.\n\nIt will, however, run on a modified version Android 10 and will have replacement apps similar in nature to the ones Google provides.\n\nWill the Huawei Mate 30 come with Google apps?\n\nIt's been the question on everyone's minds since it was announced Trump would be banning US companies from working with Chinese companies like Huawei. Trump then provided a 90-day reprieve on the ban allowing companies to continue working with Huawei in the meantime.\n\nInitially, it was speculated the Mate 30 series might sneak in as being the last Huawei device to house Google apps and the Android system but Google recently confirmed the reprieve would only apply to models already out, meaning it was a no for the unreleased Mate 30.\n\nBut Richard Yu, Huawei's CEO of the Consumer BG, announced at IFA 2019 that consumers would find the process of placing Google apps on Huawei devices as \"quite easy\" given the open source nature of Android software.\n\nHow do I get Google apps on a Mate 30?\n\nIt's not yet clear what Huawei has in mind to allow customers to continue using Google apps within its ecosystem, specifically, but it's likely got something to do with sideloading.\n\nSideloading, in this context, is when you install Android apps manually without going through the official Play Store. But, it can be a risky move as it involves some serious security concerns.\n\nOnce you've researched the security concerns, backed up your phone and triple-checked whether the apps you're sideloading are legitimate, you can start the process. Sites like APK Mirror offer you the apps but you'll need to do some of your research to determine whether they're safe for you to use.\n\nHead to Settings then Apps & notification, according to HowToGeek. You'll then need to expand the Advanced tab, select Special App Access and pick Install Unknown Apps and Allow from this source.\n\nThe Huawei Mate 30 launch is on 19 September in Munich, Germany. We'll bring you all the news from the event then.", "description": "Huawei's Mate 30 is set to be announced this week, despite a series of setbacks caused by the US and China trade wars and bans relating to security concerns.
