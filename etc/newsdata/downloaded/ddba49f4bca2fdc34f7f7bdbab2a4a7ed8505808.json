Amazon does not reveal profits or corporation tax payments for its entire UK operation, which would include its retail business as well as warehouses and logistics.\n\nRichard Murphy, professor of practice in international political economy at City, University of London, said: \u201cIf it wants us to believe it is paying the right amount of tax it has got to give enough information. No accounting number makes sense in isolation.\u201d\n\nHowever, Amazon tried to fend off accusations of tax underpayment by issuing a separate statement on Tuesday saying it paid \u00a3220m of direct taxes in the UK across its entire British operation last year including employer\u2019s national insurance, business rates, corporation tax and stamp duty.\n\nIt did not break this down to reveal the amount of corporation tax paid by its UK operation, which had total sales of $14.5bn (\u00a310.9bn) last year, according to the group\u2019s annual report.\n\nAmazon has revealed previously that it paid more than \u00a363m in business rates in 2018 and its statement issued on Tuesday made clear that it paid more than that again in employer\u2019s national insurance. That indicates that Amazon pays less than \u00a394m in other direct taxes, including corporation tax and stamp duty, across its entire UK operation.\n\nMurphy said he would expect Amazon to pay at least \u00a3100m in corporation tax alone at its UK business, assuming that it made profits at a similar rate to the group as a whole. \u201cThere is clearly an underpayment to explain,\u201d he said, calling the payment by Amazon UK Services \u201cthe square root of diddly-squat\u201d.\n\nAmazon said in 2015 that it would stop using controversial corporate structures that diverted sales and profits away from the UK, following a clampdown on the practice with the introduction of George Osborne\u2019s diverted profits tax.\n\nMurphy said the company would be under pressure to publish more transparent accounts as it was becoming normal practice for companies to \u201creveal and explain\u201d their tax bills.\n\nPaul Monaghan, chief executive the Fair Tax Mark, which accredits businesses which are fair and transparent in the tax they pay, said: \u201cThe numbers sound like pennies down the back of the couch.\u201d He said Amazon UK Services\u2019 \u00a314m UK current tax bill did not compare well with the Fair Tax Mark company Lush, which paid only about \u00a31m less in tax on profits of \u00a323.4m, less than a third of that made by the Amazon division.\n\nAmazon said in a statement: \u201cAs we continue to hire and grow in the UK, we help fund public services and infrastructure throughout the country. We do this through the taxes that are collected by the Exchequer as a consequence of our activities in the UK.\u201d\n\nAmazon said it had direct investments in its UK operations of more than \u00a318bn between 2010 and last year, including building new offices and warehouses as well as paying salaries to UK employees.", "description": "Firm attacked even though it says its contribution has nearly tripled since 2017", "authors": ["Sarah Butler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/041c99a1c7c8486e44d1982864b8e2f9e45297c6/162_0_3019_1812/master/3019.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0796964cde6934c60f7fc87cc8cf8c45"}
