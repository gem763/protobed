Guzman Lopez is wanted in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges, according to reports.\n\n\"El Chapo\" Guzman was sentenced to life behind bars in the U.S. in July, after he was found responsible for violence, including murders, and the smuggling of narcotics into the U.S., by a New York jury.\n\nIn a statement Friday that criticized the police effort, calling it \"rushed and badly planned,\" the Mexican Security Cabinet said that about 30 to 35 members of the National Guard and the Mexican Army were patrolling in the capital of Mexico's Sinaloa state Thursday around 3:45 p.m. Mexico City time, when they were fired on from a house.
