REUTERS/Guadalupe Pardo/File Photo\n\nVizcarra had proposed holding general elections a year earlier than scheduled to end an impasse with the opposition-run Congress over his proposed anti-graft reforms. He cannot run again due to term limits and has said he wants to clean house to rebuild trust with voters after back-to-back corruption scandals roiled the country in recent years.\n\nLawmakers with the right-wing opposition said they would not be strong-armed into passing legislation they disagreed with.\n\nUnder Peru\u2019s constitution, Vizcarra can now opt to summon a vote of confidence over the dispute. If denied, he would have to dismiss his entire Cabinet but could dissolve Congress in response.\n\n\u201cWe will not sit with our arms folded,\u201d Peruvian Prime Minister Salvador del Solar told a news conference, flanked by the rest of Vizcarra\u2019s Cabinet in a show of force.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to act with the authority and the strength that the constitution gives us,\u201d he added, without offering additional details.\n\nThe comments suggested a vote of confidence was afoot.\n\nPeru\u2019s sol currency depreciated 1% against the dollar after the bill was scuttled, traders said.\n\nThe showdown threatens to slow lawmaking in the world\u2019s No. 2 copper producer, where investor confidence and economic growth have already faltered on the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nSome opposition lawmakers played on those fears, urging Vizcarra to give up the proposal and try to work with them.\n\n\u201cToday more than ever, the country needs calm,\u201d said opposition lawmaker Marisol Espinoza. \u201cInvestments are leaving the country. People can\u2019t plan their lives.\u201d\n\nThe president of Congress, Pedro Olaechea, said the opposition continues to \u201cextend its hand\u201d to Vizcarra.\n\nVizcarra, a former vice president who took office last year after his predecessor resigned in a graft scandal, has surprised Peru\u2019s political and business elites by aggressively pushing reforms to uproot corruption, undeterred by having just five ruling party lawmakers in the 130-seat chamber.\n\nVizcarra\u2019s confrontational stance with Congress has won him support among ordinary Peruvians, who often greet him on the street with shouted calls of support for him to close Congress.\n\nBut hardline opposition lawmakers on the right have accused him of overstepping his constitutional bounds.\n\nVizcarra has already pushed through a law that bans the re-election of lawmakers, giving the current Congress little incentive to heed a recent Ipsos poll that shows 78% of Peruvians favor early elections.\n\nMany political analysts expect the Constitutional Court, six of whose seven members are due for reappointment by lawmakers, will eventually have to take sides in the dispute.\n\nSupporters of Vizcarra\u2019s early-election proposal accuse the opposition parties of trying to cling to their salaries and constitutional immunity from prosecution to shield them from ongoing corruption probes.\n\n\u201cThese are dark hours for democracy and this must be denounced. The entire citizenry needs to head to the streets,\u201d to protest, said leftist lawmaker Marco Arana. \u201cThe fight against corruption is in danger.\u201d", "description": "Peruvian opposition lawmakers shelved a snap election proposal from centrist President Martin Vizcarra on Thursday, knocking the country's sol currency and setting the stage for a new bout of political upheaval in one of Latin America's most stable markets.", "authors": ["Marco Aquino", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434279723&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1Z5", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
