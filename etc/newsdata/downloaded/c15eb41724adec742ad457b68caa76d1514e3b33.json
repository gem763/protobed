But he said the agreement would still have a negative impact on the economy because it would \u201celiminate the possibility of a closer relationship\u201d once the U.K. leaves the two major trading areas.\n\n\u201cIt means that future trade will face significantly higher barriers both with goods and services,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that means that we would not expect there to be a boost to the economy.\n\n\u201cIn fact what we estimate is that in the long run the economy will be 3.5 to 4 percent smaller every year. This corresponds, in today's money, roughly to the size of Welsh economic output.\u201d\n\nThe forecast is however only slightly worse than that of the deal struck by Theresa May, which NIESR said would leave national GDP 3 percent lower each year in the long run.\n\nAnalysis by the UK in a Changing Europe think tank this month estimated Johnson\u2019s proposal could reduce GDP by between 2.3 percent and 7 percent in the long term compared with remaining in the EU. The government has refused to carry out its own analysis.\n\nHantzsche said the economic picture in Britain is being damaged by Brexit uncertainty, with the future outlook \u201ccontingent on the Brexit outcome\u201d and the global slowdown in trade.\n\nThe NIESR analysis also found that the key free-trade agreements the British government hopes to strike with other countries would add 7.2 percent of GDP to the U.K. economy over a 10-15 year period, which Hantzsche said is a \u201cmarginal\u201d benefit compared with the negative impacts of the deal.\n\nBut it found that there is a reduced chance of a recession, down from 30 percent to 15 percent, because a no-deal Brexit has become less likely.", "description": "Economists say Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018Brexit dividend\u2019 does not exist.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Annabelle Dickson", "Eleni Courea", "Chris Hanretty"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-892615230-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
