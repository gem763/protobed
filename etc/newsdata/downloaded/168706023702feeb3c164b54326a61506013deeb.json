No date has been set for a final verdict.\n\nTunisia's electoral commission has said that if Mr Karoui loses Sunday's election he could appeal the result as he has not been allowed a fair campaign.\n\nMr Karoui had failed to win previous attempts to be released and began a hunger strike in September to demand his freedom.\n\nHe has never held political office. He founded a charity focused on fighting poverty, an issue that has been a central theme of his campaign.\n\nBut critics have accused him of using the charity and his TV channel to further his political ambitions.\n\nWhat happened in the election?\n\nMr Karoui and another outsider, Kais Saied, saw off a crowded field of 24 other candidates in the first round.\n\nMr Saied, an independent candidate and law professor, took 18.4% of the vote with Mr Karoui receiving 15.6% of votes cast.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Nabil Karoui will face another political outsider, Kais Saied (C), in a run-off vote\n\nThe result marked a blow for Tunisia's political establishment, including for Prime Minister Youssef Chahed and former interim President Moncef Marzouki, who both failed to progress.\n\nThe winner on Sunday will be appointed for a five-year term. Tunisia's president has control over defence, foreign policy and national security. The prime minister, chosen by parliament, is responsible for other portfolios.\n\nThe election was brought forward after the death in July of the country's first democratically elected president, Beji Caid Essebsi, who took office in 2014.\n\nYou might also be interested in:", "description": "Media mogul Nabil Karoui is freed days before he is due to stand in a presidential run-off.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B303/production/_109172854_057188385-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
