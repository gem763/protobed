I see this as something empowering. That exaggeration of femininity and what it represents. I sometimes wonder if I want to get bigger.\u201d\n\n(Image: Alexis Duran / Barcroft Media)\n\nBefore transitioning, Maxine was married and had a daughter, Mia, who still calls her Dad and came out at the age of nine.\n\nShe said: \u201cI see no reason why a trans woman can\u2019t be a father - I\u2019m still her father, I\u2019m just a woman and a dad.\"\n\nHer daughter added: \u201cThere was never any need for me to change what I call my dad because my dad always said \u2018I fathered you, so you can continue to call me by that name.\u2019\u201d\n\nMia came out as bisexual at a young age and said that having a transgender parent really helped understand her true self.\n\nShe said: \u201cBeing bisexual and having a trans parent around helped immensely.\n\n\u201cIf my dad hadn\u2019t transitioned, I probably wouldn\u2019t have come out as soon as I did without the other LGBTQ figure in my life who I knew was going to love me no matter what.\u201d\n\n(Image: Alexis Duran / Barcroft Media)\n\nMaxine thinks she would have also transitioned earlier if she had been surrounded by the same positive influences as her daughter.\n\nShe said: \u201cI was raised in a very sheltered, conservative household.\n\n\u201cWith all the information that\u2019s available now on the internet, if I had that I probably would have done this a lot sooner.\u201d\n\nRecalling her time in the armed forces, Maxine said: \u201cMy mother wanted me to join the military, I honestly don\u2019t have very fond memories of my experiences there.\n\n\u201cI was in a culture that did not accept me.\u201d\n\nAlthough she left the military before transitioning, Maxine was still in service when she started cross dressing.\n\n(Image: Barcroft Media)\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come out as transgender in the military, however that doesn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t experience dysphoria,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was wearing a skirt and some makeup, and I was walking around, word of that got back to someone in my chain of command and I ended up receiving what were flat out threats against my career.\n\n\u201cI asked myself this question: Do I ever want to be perceived as male? And the answer was an immediate no.\u201d\n\nMaxine has now been on Hormone Replacement Therapy for over a year and a half and has never been happier.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt just changed everything in a way that I could never have anticipated, it has made a world of difference in the way I feel.\u201d\n\nHowever, in order to reduce the dosage of testosterone blockers or even come off them completely, Maxine is currently planning to get bottom surgery too.\n\n\u201cI am getting what\u2019s called an orchiectomy - you have the testicles removed, and I have zero attachment to those girls so they can go.\n\n\u201cMy doctors told me that if I get those removed, she can probably lower my dosage of testosterone blockers or take me off it completely.\u201d\n\n(Image: Barcroft Media)\n\nMaxine speaks with frustration about the misconceptions that other people have of her,\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople assumed that I am attracted to men because I\u2019m female, but I\u2019m gay - people don\u2019t understand that, they can\u2019t separate gender from sexuality.\u201d\n\nMaxine is in a committed relationship with her partner Melissa, who has muscular dystrophy. Maxine is her full-time carer.\n\nMaxine added: \u201cI\u2019m a caregiver for my partner and that brings me a lot of joy.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the couple have to face a lot of judgement and prejudice directed at their inter-abled love.\n\nMaxine said: \u201cNobody wants to assume we are a couple; I can kiss her in public and people are looking at us just trying to understand what this means and how does this happen.\u201d\n\nBut the two go back over 20 years, when they met through a common friend in high school.\n\nMelissa said: \u201cIn high school she was always very feminine and that\u2019s one of the qualities I loved about her, she was my best friend.\u201d\n\nWhen they are out in public, they often receive looks and stares.\n\n\u201cA lot of people look at it negatively, there\u2019s nothing to say to those people,\u201d said Maxine.\n\nMaxine even seems to somewhat enjoy the negative looks.\n\n\u201cThe attention, I love it all, there\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t appreciate, both positive and negative - I\u2019m not dressing this way to blend, I dress to stand out so if I get negative glares, it\u2019s just kind of validating,\u201d she said.", "description": "Maxine Montoya, 38, from San Diego, USA, said she would have also transitioned earlier if she had been surrounded by the same positive influences as her daughter", "authors": ["Mark Chandler", "Image", "Alexis Duran", "Barcroft Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466862.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_My-Dads-Big-Boobs-And-Me.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
