The company directly owns four-time F1 champions Red Bull Racing and designs, develops and manufactures its cars.\n\nThe team hasn\u2019t won the F1 title since 2013 and although its spending has reached an all-time high, its performance on track still hasn\u2019t hit top gear.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Valtteri Bottas steered the Silver Arrows to victory in the race whilst reigning champion Lewis Hamilton finished third meaning that they are the only drivers left in contention for the title.\n\nRed Bull\u2019s Alex Albon finished one place behind Hamilton on Sunday but his teammate Max Verstappen retired following a collision with Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc on the opening lap. Red Bull has only won two races so far this year and both were at Verstappen\u2019s hands. In contrast, it had four victories in 2018 and this also drove up its costs.\n\nThe team won one more race in 2018 than the previous year so it had to pay higher performance bonuses to its drivers. However, the bulk of its costs were spent on staff and research and development. Salary payments rose 1.8% to \u00a384.4 million as the team added 16 staff giving a total of 809. Its team boss Christian Horner is understood to be the highest-paid director with a salary of \u00a33.4 million, according to the accounts.\n\nResearch and development costs increased by \u00a310.2 million to \u00a3118.1 million and this wasn\u2019t just driven by racing. The accounts state that \u201cthe principal activity of the group is the design, development and manufacture of Formula One racing cars.\u201d However, they add that the company also \u201capplies high-end engineering know-how outside of Formula One.\u201d This includes collaborating with Aston Martin on a 225 miles per hour hypercar and developing a range of yachts with Sunseeker.\n\nAfter paying its \u00a3304.2 million of costs, Red Bull Technology was left with a pre-tax profit of around \u00a310 million as it had \u00a3314 million of revenue. This largely came from prize money, sponsors such as watchmaker TAG Heuer and payments from Red Bull itself.\n\nThe energy drinks giant ultimately owns Red Bull Technology and its logos are emblazoned on the F1 cars. It paid the team \u00a3104.2 million for this exposure last year, an increase of 10.6% on 2017. It remains to be seen how long this will continue.\n\nF1 is rapidly approaching a crossroads as the teams\u2019 race contracts all expire at the end of next year and the sport\u2019s governing body, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile (FIA) has proposed introducing radical new regulations after that. Major aerodynamic changes are under discussion as well as the re-introduction of mid-race refuelling which hasn\u2019t been allowed since 2009.\n\nThe accounts point out that \u201cchanges in regulations by the FIA can have a material impact on a team\u2019s competitive capabilities with significant commercial consequences.\u201d Ominously, they add that \u201cthe company is mindful that under the new commercial and regulatory framework, post-2020, Formula One needs to remain attractive for Red Bull\u2019s continued support.\u201d\n\nThe FIA has committed to finalising the new regulations by the end of this month so it is now in a race against time to get all of the teams across the finish line.", "description": "Red Bull\u2019s flagship Formula One team poured more money into its 2019 campaign than it did in any previous season since it was bought by the energy drinks giant in 2004, according to recently released accounts.", "authors": ["Christian Sylt"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/10/Red-Bull.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
