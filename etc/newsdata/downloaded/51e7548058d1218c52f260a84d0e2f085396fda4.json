She currently serves as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia at the Defense Department.\n\nCooper previously served as principal director in the office of the assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense and global security affairs. She joined the Defense Department in 2001 and before that, worked at the State Department.\n\nShe's appearing before Congress Wednesday even though the Defense Department told Congress that it wouldn't comply with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nMichael Duffey, a politically appointed official in the White House budget office, was also scheduled to testify behind closed doors Wednesday but is not expected to appear after Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Russell Vought announced that his office wouldn't cooperate with the probe.\n\nCooper's testimony comes a day after what Democrats described as bombshell testimony from Taylor, who serves as charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a copy of his opening statement provided to NBC News, Taylor said that E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland told him that while Trump was not requesting a \"quid pro quo,\" he insisted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy publicly announce investigations into the Bidens and matters relating to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAs Cooper's closed-door deposition kicked off Wednesday, a number of House Republicans \u2014 who don't sit on the committees questioning the Pentagon official \u2014 descended into the basement of the House Capitol Visitor's Center where the deposition is taking place and attempted to enter the room.\n\nThe GOP members were protesting Democrats' handling of the probe, arguing that the process was not fair to Republicans or the president.", "description": "Cooper is expected to face questions about the Trump administration's decision to temporarily withhold military assistance to Ukraine over the summer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4253450/1000x563_nbc-191023-laura-cooper-al-1032_b25ab918876b187a1760899c314a9ada.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
