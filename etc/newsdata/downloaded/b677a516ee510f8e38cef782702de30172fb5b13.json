The prosecutor's office said Logan exited the vehicle and approached the officer with a knife raised and the officer opened fire.\n\nAuthorities say no police video exists of the confrontation. St. Joseph County Prosecutor Ken Cotter said O\u2019Neill's dash and body cameras weren\u2019t activated because he was driving slowly without his emergency lights on while looking for a person possibly breaking into cars about 3:30 a.m. Sunday.\n\nLogan, 54, died at a hospital.\n\nPete Buttigieg shares a moment with Shirley Newbill during a gun violence memorial in South Bend, Indiana.

During his first term in office, he fired the city's first black police chief, according to the AP. He also was criticized for his handling of past shootings that involved police officers and the lack of diversity in the city's police department. Forty percent of South Bend residents are black or Hispanic, but the police department is almost 90% white, the AP reported.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nContributing: Rebecca Morin, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/06/22/pete-buttigieg-asked-black-lives-matter-during-heated-protest-racism-racist-2020-presidential-race/1535958001/", "description": "Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg cancelled several 2020 campaign events this week following a police-involved shooting that left a black man dead.", "authors": ["Alia E.
