YUM, +1.58% portfolio of QSR chains, and Burger King is part of Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR, -0.84% Impossible Foods is privately held.\n\nSee: Vegetarian diets can\u2019t save Earth, but eating less meat might\n\nIt\u2019s those partnerships that are giving those two companies an edge in the plant-based meat sector, Sundaram said.\n\n\u201cWe forecast Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods will remain the fastest-growing players in the space over the next couple of years, thanks to demand from quick-service restaurants,\u201d the CFRA note said.\n\nBeyond Meat closed its first day of trading on May 2 at $65.75. The stock closed Tuesday at $160.31.\n\nAlso: KFC is selling meatless fried chicken \u2013 is it actually healthier than the real thing?\n\nBut Tyson TSN, -0.69% could make inroads into the category by being healthier and using the global connections it has developed throughout its supply chain.\n\nTyson has launched Raised & Rooted, which produces both plant-based products and items that are a blend of animal and plant proteins. The company has also invested in New Wave Foods, a plant-based shellfish company.\n\n\u201cIts blended beef and plant-based patties specifically target the \u2018flexitarian\u2019 demographic, who are defined as consumers who purchase both meat and meat alternatives,\u201d wrote Sundaram.\n\n\u201cThis patty stands out from competition, not only because it\u2019s a blended meat and plant-based burger, but because it seems to be the healthiest option in the marketplace - it has a comparable amount of protein to traditional 80/20 beef burgers and other plant-based burgers, such as those offered by Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, but far less total fat and saturated fat. We think more and more consumers are looking at labels and realizing that many plant-based products are not as healthy as they initially thought, and this is where we think Tyson can stand out.\u201d\n\nSee: Tyson says nuggets from Beyond Meat rival Raised & Rooted to be available in 4,000 stores\n\nWhichever company leads the plant-based meat space, it will be competing with a growing number of brands. CFRA points out that Hormel Foods Inc. HRL, -0.49% has launched a new line, Happy Little Plants. Grocer Kroger Co. KR, -1.68% is launching private-label Simple Truth Plant Based. And Kellogg Co.\u2019s K, -0.84% MorningStar has introduced Incogmeato which will be in grocery stores and among foodservice options in early 2020.\n\nDow Jones Market Data Group\n\n\u201cOf these three companies, we think Kroger\u2019s launch will have the greatest positive, short-term impact to sales growth since it is the first major grocer to launch an entire collection of its own plant-based products,\u201d wrote CFRA.\n\nHowever, even if there are more players in the plant-based game, CFRA says companies don\u2019t have to worry about this category becoming \u201ccommoditized\u201d because of the high level of research and development that goes into creating these products.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we think Beyond Meat will try and grab more seasoned executives with experience in building scale quickly since manufacturing capacity seems to be the biggest near-term constraint,\u201d wrote Sundaram.\n\nBeyond Meat stock has lost 10.8% over the last three months. Tyson shares have gained 13.5%. Hormel shares have gained 4.5%. Kroger stock is up 5.1%. And Kellogg stock has rallied 13.8%. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.03% is up 2.2% for the period.", "description": "CFRA analyzes the plant-based meat space and the competition that\u2019s heating up between a number of players.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GE089_beyond_ZG_20180221034751.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
