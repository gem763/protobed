REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nThe Solomon Islands was the sixth country to switch allegiance to China since 2016. Self-ruled Taiwan has accused China - which claims Taiwan as its territory - of trying to meddle in its upcoming elections.\n\nSolomons Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare had asked Pence in July for a meeting, the senior administration official told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The meeting was to have taken place this month on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, or afterward in Washington.\n\n\u201cBut the decision by the Solomon Islands to change its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People\u2019s Republic of China has consequences. They\u2019re hurting a historically strong relationship by doing this,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a setback, and it\u2019s prioritizing short-term gain with China over long-term commitment with the U.S.,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe United States - which has a fraught relationship with China over trade, defense and technology issues - upholds what is known as the \u201cone-China\u201d policy, officially recognizing Beijing and not Taipei, while assisting Taiwan.\n\nWashington and Beijing are embroiled in a trade war, slapping tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods. The United States is also pushing to restrict Chinese state-owned telecom companies over concerns about espionage - allegations rejected by China.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration is also considering confronting China over its detention of some 1 million Muslims in Xinjiang province at next week\u2019s U.N. meeting.\n\nCHEAP LOANS\n\nPence has criticized China for what he calls \u201cdebt-trap\u201d lending practices to small countries, pushing them into debt and compromising their sovereignty. China denies those charges.\n\n\u201cCountries that establish closer ties to China primarily out of the hope or expectation that such a step will stimulate economic growth and infrastructure development often find themselves worse off in the long run,\u201d the U.S. official told Reuters.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the United States had no right to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries when it came to their relations with China, and pointed out that the United States also had no formal ties with Taiwan.\n\nIf the United States really cares about Pacific island countries, it should do more to help them improve their economies and people\u2019s lives and not \u201cbrandish the stick of sanctions\u201d at them, spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters.\n\nAfter the Solomon Islands decision, Taiwan has formal relations with only 16 countries, many of them small, less-developed nations in Central America and the Pacific.\n\nTaiwan has accused China of trying to lure away its allies with offers of cheap loans and other financial inducements.\n\nOn Wednesday, Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Ministry posted on its Facebook page messages from Solomon Islanders lamenting their country\u2019s decision to abandon Taiwan.\n\n\u201cThe people of the Solomon Islands continue to leave us comments expressing their gratitude to the technical mission and the medical team which have been working to help the local people there for years,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cTaiwan provides aid by bringing better lives to the local people directly, and we don\u2019t leave a debt trap in our wake. And this is the Taiwan model.\u201d\n\nThe Solomons, a former British protectorate that is home to about 600,000 people, had been the largest of the Taiwan-aligned Pacific countries, with access to airfields and deepwater ports dating back to World War Two.\n\nAfter his July phone call with Pence, Sogavare sent him a letter, saying he was \u201cfavorably disposed\u201d to ask his Cabinet to defer a decision on its Taiwan ties until later in the year.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nSogavare emphasized that he needed help from the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Taiwan to develop infrastructure - a critical domestic issue for his government - according to a copy of the letter reviewed by Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt is the one agenda that has the potential to split the cabinet and could potentially cause the government to fall,\u201d Sogavare said in the letter.\n\nBeijing said on Tuesday that the Solomon Islands would have unprecedented development opportunities after cutting ties with Taiwan. China had offered $8.5 million in development funds to the Solomons ahead of its decision.", "description": "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has canceled plans to meet the leader of the Solomon Islands to discuss development partnerships after the Pacific island cut ties with Taiwan in favor of China this week, a senior U.S. official said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Roberta Rampton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431029215&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H00I", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
