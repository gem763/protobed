The device, due out next year, is another piece of the puzzle in Microsoft's efforts to unify Android phones with Windows PCs via the Microsoft Your Phone app.\n\nSo far, Microsoft has focused on tightly integrating Windows 10 with select Galaxy devices, such as the Galaxy Note10. This preview brings new features from the Galaxy Note10 to the Samsung Galaxy S10, S10+, S10e, S10 5G, and the Galaxy Fold.\n\nThe update includes a feature called Link to Windows, which, Microsoft promises, \"seamlessly connects your phone to your Windows 10 PC\".\n\n\"With Link to Windows natively integrated into your device, it's simple and convenient to send messages, manage notifications, sync photos, and mirror your phone on your PC,\" Microsoft says.\n\nAlso rolling out to these Galaxy devices is 'Phone screen', a Your Phone feature that allows users to access Android phone apps from the PC. The phone apps can be accessed using the keyboard and mouse or touch.\n\n\"You can try out multi-touch gestures such as pinch to zoom, rotate, or swipe from your PC's touchscreen while using Phone screen,\" Microsoft says.\n\nThe features are rolling out to \"select global markets\", and Phone screen is a \"gradual rollout\", so some users might not see it just yet.\n\nThe Your Phone app on Windows 10 now also displays the device's battery level and its phone's screen wallpaper.\n\nMicrosoft has also added several improvements to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) detailed in release notes.\n\nImage: Microsoft\n\nMore on Microsoft's Windows 10 20H1 update", "description": "As well 'passwordless' Safe mode, Microsoft brings Galaxy Note10 Your Phone features to Galaxy S10.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/04/3022e8cb-1772-4d39-8500-85bf177a79e2/thumbnail/770x578/bf334d3f82096a135d3e62281558177e/businessmanlaptopistock-1158476100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
