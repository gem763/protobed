Only five countries have met targets to reduce HIV deaths by 75 per cent by 2020.\n\nBut investment in essential prevention, diagnostic and treatment services is falling as the financial burden is shifting from international donors to affected countries.\n\nAccording to MSF, this transition is taking place too quickly \u2013 with developing countries struggling to compensate for shortfalls.\n\nIn 2018 funding for HIV programmes from domestic and international sources fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping by roughly $1 billion (\u00a3800 million) in low and middle income countries.\n\nThe gap for TB programmes is also growing \u2013 according to UN figures, the shortfall has now reached $3.5 billion (\u00a32.8 billion).", "description": "Countries across the globe are at risk of witnessing an HIV and tuberculosis \u201cepidemic rebound\u201d because of a decline in funding, experts have warned.", "authors": ["Sarah Newey", "Global Health Security Correspondent", "Daniel Berman"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2019/08/14/TELEMMGLPICT000004340442-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqvxig_go-nndg4gfA2VqsCgjp1U1thm56N-DWmwJUAxg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-08-14"}
