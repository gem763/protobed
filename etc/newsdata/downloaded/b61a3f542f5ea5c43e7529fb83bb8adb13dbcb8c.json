The couple are \u201cthrilled\u201d to be expecting again after several miscarriages.\n\n\u201cThrilled beyond belief to announce that another little bundle of joy has picked us to be their family,\u201d Van Der Beek wrote. \u201cWe chose to have our first ultrasound on camera with our #DWTS crew capturing the result \u2014 something I NEVER thought we\u2019d ever do\u2026 but @vanderkimberly and I have been through three of those appointments to discover either no heartbeat, or no baby, and she wanted to share this moment.\u201d\n\nVan Der Beek said he and his wife have been open about their experience in an effort to destigmatize miscarriages and encourage people to seek support.\n\n\u201cMiscarriage (a word that needs a replacement \u2014 nobody failed to \u2018carry\u2019, these things sometimes just happen) is something that people rarely talk about, and often go through in secret. But there needs to be zero shame around it, or around giving yourself the time and space to grieve,\u201d the star said.\n\n\u201cWe decided to put ourselves out there \u2013 not knowing what we\u2019d find \u2014 in an effort to chip away at any senseless stigma around this experience and to encourage people who might be going through it to open themselves up to love & support from friends and family when they need it most,\u201d he added.\n\nKimberly Van Der Beek went public about her miscarriages in September 2018. Van Der Beek subsequently reflected on grief in an emotional Instagram post.\n\n\u201cIt will tear you open like nothing else. It\u2019s painful and it\u2019s heartbreaking on levels deeper than you may have ever experienced. So don\u2019t judge your grief, or try to rationalize your way around it,\u201d he advised. \u201cLet it flow in the waves in which it comes, and allow it it\u2019s rightful space.\u201d\n\nVan Der Beek is partnered with Emma Slater in Dancing with the Stars Season 28. The pair performed a quickstep to \u201cWalking on Sunshine\u201d by Katrina and the Waves during Monday\u2019s episode.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 View this post on Instagram A post shared by James Van Der Beek (@vanderjames) on Jul 1, 2019 at 11:35am PDT James Van Der Beek is", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
