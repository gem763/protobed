The Sueddeutsche Zeitung first reported the news.\n\nThe securities at issue are known as AT1 and AT2 bonds.\n\nThe bonds, which emerged after the financial crisis, are designed to protect taxpayers from potential bailout costs if a bank runs into hardship by putting the risk in the hands of the holders of the bonds.\n\nBut it may defeat the purpose if the bank holds the bonds, which is why the ECB requires a bank to seek its authorization to do so.\n\nDeutsche Bank sought authorization in 2014 for the purchase of the bonds, but it was denied, the people said. The lender continued to buy them anyway, in an attempt to create a liquid market, one of the people said.\n\nThe ECB eventually authorized Deutsche Bank to buy the bonds in 2017, but the ruling wasn't retroactive.\n\nThe ECB is now in a fact-finding phase to determine whether it should open a formal investigation, the people said.\n\nDeutsche Bank is in the midst of a broad restructuring, involving job cuts and the exit of certain business lines in an effort to become profitable.\n\nIts Chief Executive Officer, Christian Sewing, recently criticized the ECB for its interest rate policy.", "description": "ECB weighs investigating Deutsche Bank over alleged unauthorized bond purchases: sources", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8H0UG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
