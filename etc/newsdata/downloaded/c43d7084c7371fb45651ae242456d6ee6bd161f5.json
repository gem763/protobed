Louie Douvis\n\nMr Beavis, who addressed The Australian Financial Review National Energy Summit on Wednesday, said in an interview ahead of the event that AWS client Origin Energy now collects smart meter data every half an hour, generating over 17,520 data points, up from just four per year from quarterly readings.\n\nThis data generated in retail customer homes and commercial businesses is processed and stored by AWS on its servers in Sydney, rather than Origin building its own infrastructure.", "description": "Origin Energy is fighting to combat low customer trust and high turnover by putting their data, collected by Amazon Web Services, in the hands of customers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4125%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_524%2C$y_106/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cff424168e09f55b3821e10417459800ffc6ea92", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
