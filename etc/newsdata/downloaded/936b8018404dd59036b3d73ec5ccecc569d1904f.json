It will also conduct due diligence on the proposed tokens before allowing them to reach investors.\n\nAuthorized token investors in Thailand are set to include retail and institutional, high net worth persons, venture capital and private equity funds.\n\nStephen Ng, Chief Marketing Officer of SE Digital, told the Post that the SEC\u2019s approval was poised to open a new chapter in Thailand\u2019s capital market history and pave the way to its digital economic transformation, as it becomes one of the first ASEAN nations to offer fully-compliant ICOs. He continued to outline that:\n\n\u201cSE Digital will be able to promote the tokenisation of traditional assets providing investors with access to previously illiquid and difficult to access assets such as commercial real estate and investment products with global exposure, while offering issuers with a new fundraising alternative that allows access to a wider pool of capital providers with cost savings accrued from the digitisation on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nAn evolving stance\n\nAs previously reported, news of the SEC\u2019s plans to authorize an ICO portal in the country first surfaced in November 2018, with further details emerging in March.\n\nIn December 2018, the Thai SEC had announced its intention to consider loosening rules that form a barrier to ICOs, although suggested there would be caps on participation.", "description": "SE Digital, a subsidiary of major financial services firm Seamico Securities, has been confirmed as the first ICO portal operator to be approved by the Thai SEC", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMjg1MDFlMzIwM2VmYzJiMDQyY2JmNTNhMmVhMDkyM2MuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
