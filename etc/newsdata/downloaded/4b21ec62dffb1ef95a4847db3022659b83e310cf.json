(OTC: ACRGF) CEO Kevin Murphy said Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking at the Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference in Chicago, Murphy, the head of one of the biggest publicly traded cannabis companies, said he\u2019s been around a long time and seen ups and downs before.\n\n\u201cI lived through the crash of the late '80s, saw the crisis of the early '90s [and] capitalized on crisis in \u201998,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of ebbs and flows in capitals markets.\u201d\n\n'A Very Healthy Sense Of Humility'\n\nAcreage is among the companies that has been in a free fall over the last six months after a couple years when cannabis stocks were darlings of the market.\n\nAcreage closed Tuesday's session at $5.71, down from a level near $25 per share at its high in early May.\n\nAcreage is in a quiet period, so Murphy said he couldn\u2019t specifically address his company\u2019s stock. But he remains an optimist about long-term industry prospects.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a very healthy sense of humility weaved back into this business,\u201d the CEO said.\n\n\u201cI have never been more optimistic about the industry \u2014 this is exciting times for us. I\u2019m the guy that looks five years, 10 years out. I see where we\u2019re going [as the] fastest-growing industry, not just in the U.S., but globally.\u201d\n\nAcreage has a binding agreement to be acquired by Canadian cannabis giant Canopy Growth Corp. (NYSE: CGC), but only if cannabis is federally legalized in the U.S.\n\nMurphy also teased a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d on a social equity initiative, aimed at broadening access to the industry for marginalized players, whom Murphy said the big players need to help empower.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have available capital ... the rich will get richer and frankly the poor will just need not apply,\u201d he said.\n\nAcreage believes in helping expand opportunities, he said, though he didn't offer specifics about the coming announcement.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nAcreage CEO Kevin Murphy: 'There's No Greater Privilege Than Enriching The Lives Of Others'\n\nCresco Labs CEO: The Future Of Cannabis Legalization Includes Social Equity\n\nAcreage Holdings CEO Kevin Murphy.
