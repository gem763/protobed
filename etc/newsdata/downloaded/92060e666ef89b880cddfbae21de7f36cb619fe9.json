On stage, Ifans has had a memorable stint of late, playing a terrific, mouldy Scrooge at The Old Vic and a decaying, 400-year-old monarch in Exit The King.\n\nNow back in his native Welsh capital, he brings his powerful stage presence \u2013 and a shaggy beard \u2013 to this new role as a lugubrious butcher, John Daniel, who inhabits a derelict shop on the side of a mountain.\n\nAs inscrutable as any Samuel Beckett play, this evening comes with warm, lyrical echoes of Dylan Thomas. (Ifans, incidentally, was Captain Cat in the 2015 film version of the poet\u2019s classic play Under Milk Wood.)\n\nNow back in his native Welsh capital, Rhys Ifans brings his powerful stage presence \u2013 and a shaggy beard \u2013 to this new role as a lugubrious butcher, John Daniel\n\nThe \u2018old language\u2019 is constantly referred to. It\u2019s not necessarily Welsh, it\u2019s just dead. So is John Daniel\u2019s son. He was a philosophy student: \u2018The only one of our family who ever thunk,\u2019 says his poor dad.\n\nThe boy\u2019s mother, Noni \u2013 touchingly played by Rakie Ayola \u2013 lets you into her grief with great delicacy, as you learn the family\u2019s terrible story.\n\nThe evening is also funny \u2013 Ifans getting big laughs with his understatements and eccentricities, and congratulating his trousers on their goodness and loyalty \u2013 as well as being a refreshing hymn to the unvegan joys of a good chop.\n\nDaniel's son's mother, Noni \u2013 touchingly played by Rakie Ayola \u2013 lets you into her grief with great delicacy and such horrors are evoked when an army captain (Jason Hughes) arrives\n\nThe shop\u2019s slaughter boy (Sion Daniel Young) pops up to add to the carnivorous theme.\n\nMeat is in the play\u2019s fibre. The writer Ed Thomas (who also co-directs with Vicky Featherstone) came from a village where his father ran an abattoir and butcher\u2019s shop.\n\nThe play also recalls the celebrated 1943 docudrama The Silent Village, which imagines a Welsh community of resistant miners who all die singing when executed by the occupying Nazis.\n\nSuch horrors are evoked here when an army captain (Jason Hughes) arrives, traumatised, having seen or committed God knows what atrocities.\n\nThe play comes with an overdose of alternative-reality miserabilism and feels stretched even at 90 minutes. But the lush poetic richness of the language is the joy here, and Ifans\u2019 sonorous butcher revels in it, his voice reverberating in lightly falling snow.\n\nThe Permanent Way\n\nThe Vaults, London Until November 17, 1hr 40mins\n\nRating:\n\n\u2018Britain. Beautiful place. Yeah. Shame we can\u2019t run a railway.\u2019 That\u2019s the resounding passenger verdict in this play staged in the brick vaults right under Waterloo Station. The rumble of trains provides the soundtrack to a compelling piece of journalistic drama \u2013 first seen in 2003 \u2013 about our rubbish railways.\n\nThe play looks at four rail crashes \u2013 Southall, Ladbroke Grove, Hatfield and Potters Bar. David Hare\u2019s clever, verbatim play becomes an emotional ride into the corporate heart of Blair\u2019s Britain.\n\nA cast of nine provide 40 characters, including railway big-wigs, civil servants, bankers, survivors and victims. You learn what it feels like to be in a crash and to witness the dead.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t you know? You always lose your shoes,\u2019 is one line I won\u2019t forget.\n\nThe Permanent Way looks at four rail crashes \u2013 a cast of nine (including Jonathan Coote) provide 40 characters, including railway big-wigs, civil servants, bankers and survivors\n\nThe piece is 16 years old but the emotional impact of Alexander Lass\u2019s production is totally live. You reel at the sacrifice of safety to profit, the buck-passing, the craven cover-ups and the corporate greed behind these successive tragedies.\n\nI came out boiling with rage.\n\nFor Services Rendered\n\nJermyn Street Theatre, London Until Saturday, 2hrs 10mins\n\nRating:\n\nSomerset Maugham\u2019s \u2018Anyone for tennis?\u2019 country-house play looks innocent enough. But beneath the gentility of this lost classic lurks a furious post-mortem of World War I.\n\nWritten in 1932, his verdict is damning and depicts a land utterly unfit for heroes \u2013 and indeed for the women who picked up the pieces. Of the play\u2019s walking wounded there\u2019s a blinded son, a bankrupt and an alcoholic.\n\nIt also features three sisters marooned \u2013 Chekhov-style \u2013 in a comfortable rural hell with zero prospects. The eldest, Eva (Rachel Pickup), is sick of caring for her sightless brother and is in love with an ex-naval hero who\u2019s probably gay.\n\nShe goes insane.\n\nWritten in 1932, Somerset Maugham's verdict is damning and depicts a land utterly unfit for heroes \u2013 and indeed for the women who picked up the pieces (Viss Elliot Safavi, above)\n\nOf the other two, one torments a besotted chap old enough to be her father (Michael Lumsden), the other is miserably married to a brutish, whisky-sodden tenant farmer.\n\nDiana Fletcher plays \u2013 superbly \u2013 the serene family matriarch but Tom Littler\u2019s cast is let down by a couple of under-par performances. But this damn-you-England drama still explodes in the second half like a grenade.\n\nThe Entertainer New Victoria Theatre, Woking\n\nTouring until November 30, 2hrs 20mins\n\nRating:\n\nJohn Osborne wrote The Entertainer in 1956, the year of the Suez Crisis \u2013 an event so catastrophic for Britain\u2019s image, global influence and sense of identity that it has drawn comparisons with Brexit today.\n\nThis bleak play, with its tale of a former music-hall act, Archie Rice, fallen on hard times, was a metaphor for this failure and the country\u2019s post-war malaise and loss of empire.\n\nHere, though, director Sean O\u2019Connor has placed the action during the Falklands War of 1982 \u2013 another torrid time when Britain found itself in the international spotlight, unemployment soared and race riots flared up under the prime minister Margaret Thatcher.\n\nAs a former stand-up and game-show host, ex- EastEnder Shane Richie has the tacky shtick and patter spot on when playing the iconic Archie Rice\n\nThe original production saw Laurence Olivier take the iconic Rice role \u2013 a daring, career-changing move for the actor. Since then it has starred Max Wall, Michael Gambon and, most recently, Kenneth Branagh (self-directed, rather too nattily dressed, nimbly tap-dancing).\n\nAs a former stand-up and game-show host, ex-EastEnder Shane Richie has the tacky shtick and patter spot on. He\u2019s also more of a wide boy whose appalling sexist material is dying with the Eighties wave of alternative comedy.\n\nThere are updated jokes and songs (Born With A Smile On My Face is bitterly ironic) and he even drags up as Mrs T. Stick that up your junta, as the anti-Argie Sun headline ran.\n\nWomanising, tax-avoiding Archie carries on acting up a storm at his lowly seaside home too, where the family is drowning in booze: a gin-swilling wife at the end of her tether (Sara Crowe), an anti-war protesting daughter (Diana Vickers), a fulminating racist grandad and a returning war-hero son.\n\nRichie gives a sense of desperation and doom (though he could perhaps do with more grit and venom) in a brave reinterpretation of a modern classic.\n\nMark Cook\n\nMamma Mia! The Party\n\nO2, London Until February 16, 3hrs 30mins (plus optional disco)\n\nRating:\n\nHere we go again: after a musical and two movies, Mamma Mia! has a new incarnation. Guests take their seats in a Greek taverna \u2013 inside the O2 with much plastic foliage and sun-dappled lighting \u2013 for a four-course meal, during which a story stitched together with those durable Abba hits unfolds around you.\n\nThe plot is cheesier than a truckload of feta. Kate (Steph Parry) runs the taverna with her Greek husband, whom she met while filming Mamma Mia! But now Nikos (Fed Zanni) is reluctant to let her nephew be with his daughter. Can love conquer all?\n\nOf course it can, and this show will conquer audiences \u2013 as long as they can forget how much money, money, money they paid. Tickets start at \u00a3151.\n\nHolly Williams", "description": "Think of Rhys Ifans and you can't help but remember Spike from the film Notting Hill - Hugh Grant's rancid, lovable, scene-stealing flatmate in underpants.", "authors": ["Robert Gore-Langton For Event Magazine"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/15/18967946-0-image-a-81_1569507735344.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
