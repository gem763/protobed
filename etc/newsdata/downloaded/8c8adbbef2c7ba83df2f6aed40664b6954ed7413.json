LOUIS (AP) - The top doctor at Missouri\u2019s sole abortion clinic on Wednesday defended its handling of four patients who faced complications - women whose care has been cited by the state as it seeks to revoke the clinic\u2019s license.\n\nThe testimony from Dr. Colleen McNicholas at a hearing that could determine the St. Louis clinic\u2019s fate came as the state faced fallout over a revelation a day earlier from Missouri\u2019s top health official that he kept a spreadsheet that tracked the menstrual cycles of women who obtained abortions.\n\nMissouri officials were staying mum, while Democrats and abortion-rights supporters decried what they called government overreach into women\u2019s private lives.\n\nDuring testimony Tuesday, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Director Randall Williams said the spreadsheet was compiled at his request. He said the goal was to find women who had what the state calls \u201cfailed abortions,\u201d in which a woman is still pregnant after an abortion and needs more than one procedure to complete it.\n\nMcNicholas told the administrative hearing that the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis followed protocol in all of the instances cited by the state. She said that while a surgical abortion is safer than even a colonoscopy or tonsillectomy, complications do happen.\n\nYamelsie Rodriguez, president and CEO of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, told reporters that the organization learned of Williams\u2019 spreadsheet from his testimony. She did not know how many patients were listed on the spreadsheet.\n\n\u201cI think what is deeply disturbing about that is the fact that Director Randall Williams is using his position of authority and power to push a political agenda in order to try to end access to safe and legal abortion in the state of Missouri,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nWilliams declined interview requests. Several messages left with spokeswomen for Williams and Republican Gov. Mike Parson were not immediately returned. The Associated Press also submitted open records requests seeking additional information.\n\nWilliams testified that the spreadsheet contained information accessible by the state through its annual inspection, performed in March. It also included medication identification numbers, dates of procedures and the gestational ages of fetuses, The Kansas City Star reported. The spreadsheet did not include patients\u2019 names.\n\nThe state has said it is concerned about patient care, and Williams called safety \u201cthe North Star\u201d of the licensing process.\n\nMissouri House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, a Democrat, called for an investigation to determine whether patient privacy was compromised or laws were broken. State Auditor Nicole Galloway, who is running for governor in 2020, called for Williams to be fired.\n\nThe spreadsheet was developed after an inspector raised concerns about an abortion that took five procedures to complete. That led to an investigation that found four overall instances where women underwent multiple procedures to complete their abortions. Among those cases was one where the doctor missed that the patient was pregnant with twins, requiring two procedures five weeks apart, according to Williams\u2019 testimony.\n\nElizabeth Nash, a state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a national research group that supports abortion rights and tracks abortion legislation, told the AP she hasn\u2019t heard of another case where a state agency has tracked menstruation as part of regulating a clinic.\n\nDr. Jennifer Conti, a San Francisco-area abortion provider, said in an interview that tracking periods is not a reliable way to determine when a pregnancy has ended and suggested that data was used to avoid having to obtain women\u2019s consent for access to addition information.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very odd and it feels like an invasion of privacy,\u201d said Conti, who is a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health.\n\nThe state moved to revoke the clinic\u2019s license in June, prompting a court fight that was turned over to the Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission, which is conducting the hearing. A ruling isn\u2019t expected before February.\n\nMissouri would become the first state since 1974, the year after the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision, without a functioning abortion clinic if the license is revoked. Three clinics near Missouri offer the procedure. Two are in Illinois suburbs of St. Louis, and one is in a Kansas suburb of Kansas City.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Missouri, and John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The top doctor at Missouri's sole abortion clinic on Wednesday defended its handling of four patients who faced complications - women whose care has been cited by the state as it seeks to revoke the clinic's license.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Salter"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/abortion_missouri_17581_c0-104-1824-1168_s1200x700.jpg?92ff669af92bc79bf84286cb63c631da28b5d20d", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
