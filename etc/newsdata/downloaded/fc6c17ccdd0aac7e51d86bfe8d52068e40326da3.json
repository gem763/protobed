They've won 18 of 20 overall dating back to the regular season, with the last two over AL Cy Young Award favorites Gerrit Cole and Verlander.\n\nGame 3 is Friday night when An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez opposes Houston's Zack Greinke in the first World Series game in the nation's capital since 1933.\n\nThe 31-year-old Strasburg had waited years for this chance. Back in 2012, he was about two years removed from Tommy John surgery when Nationals brass decided protecting his elbow was more important than pitching him in the playoffs, so he was shut down late in a season full of promise.\n\nMaking his Series debut, Strasburg allowed a two-run homer to Alex Bregman in the first before throwing five shutout innings to improve 4-0 this postseason. He allowed seven hits and struck out seven.\n\nVerlander, so good in the regular season, fell to 0-5 in six World Series starts. He gave up seven hits and four runs, and was lifted after walking a batter following Suzuki's home run.\n\nVerlander led the majors with 21 wins this season and struck out a career-high 300 to reach 3,000 in his career. He has a World Series ring, MVP and Cy Award trophies, and three no-hitters on his resume.\n\nHe struck out six to become the career leader in postseason Ks with 202 \u2014 another impressive statistic on a stellar resume that is still missing that elusive World Series win.\n\nTheir dominance against Houston's best pitchers turned the underdog Nationals into heavy favorites to win the title. Only three of the previous 25 teams to lose the first two games at home under the 2-3-2 format have come back to win the Series. No one has done it since the 1996 New York Yankees.\n\nThings went wrong immediately for Verlander when he walked leadoff man Trea Turner on four pitches. Eaton, who homered in the eighth, singled before Anthony Rendon, the Houston native who said he'd certainly have 100 friends and family members at Minute Maid Park for each game, knocked a ball off the wall in left field for a double that put the Nationals up 2-0.\n\nMichael Brantley singled with two outs in the bottom of the first before Bregman's homer to left tied it. After hitting .167 with no homers in the ALCS and struggling in the opener of this series, Bregman took a second to admire his homer before nonchalantly tossing his bat and trotting to first.\n\nAll eight of Bregman's postseason home runs have come off All-Stars.\n\nVerlander got his 200th postseason strikeout when he fanned Victor Robles for the second out in the second inning. The eight-time All-Star passed John Smoltz, who had 199 and was in the TV booth for Fox to see his record fall.\n\nVerlander and Strasburg both settled in after their early wobbles and neither pitcher allowed the hitters to string much together until things fell apart for Houston in the seventh.\n\nSuzuki sent Verlander's 100th pitch sailing above the seats in left field to start the inning and put the Nationals on top. Ryan Pressly, who left Game 6 of the ALCS with a knee injury, took over and didn't look right from the start.\n\nHe walked Turner before manager AJ Hinch called for his first intentional walk of the season when he gave Juan Soto a free pass to load the bases with two outs. Howie Kendrick, Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera and Ryan Zimmerman followed with successive singles to bust this one open, putting the Nationals up 8-2. As those hits were piling up and run after run crossed the plate, many in the stunned sellout crowd of 43,357 began streaming for the exits.\n\nMichael A. Taylor padded the lead further when he hit a solo shot off Chris Devenski in the ninth.\n\nThe only time Strasburg was under any kind of real duress after the first inning came when Yuli Gurriel doubled with one out in the sixth before the Nationals intentionally walked Yordan Alvarez. But slumping Carlos Correa hit a weak fly ball for an out before rookie pinch-hitter Kyle Tucker struck out to allow Strasburg to wriggle out of the jam and end his solid night.\n\nWhile the game was still close, Verlander made a play guaranteed to put him on the World Series blooper reel. It came in the fourth inning when he spun to the ground and skidded on his back to snag a soft tapper from Zimmerman on the third base side. The grab was fine, but his worst throw of the night came next when he bounced it off his left shin. He got to his feet to reveal grass stains on the back his jersey and on his hip, shook his head and chuckled at his errant toss.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
