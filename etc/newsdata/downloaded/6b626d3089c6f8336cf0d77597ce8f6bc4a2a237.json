He\u2019s been courting his congressional allies with golf, a World Series game and frequent phone calls \u2014 all to develop an echo chamber of support from his allies in Congress.\n\nBut the White House is largely leaving the prickly task of managing the Senate Republican Conference to McConnell. Though much of the pair's contact is concealed even from aides, people familiar with the conversations say they speak all the time \u2014 and there\u2019s been an uptick in recent weeks as the impeachment threat grows more serious.\n\nMcConnell is helped by the president\u2019s other close allies in the chamber, including GOP Sens. David Perdue of Georgia and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who traveled with Trump on Friday and golfed with him Saturday. All three help the White House indirectly communicate with other senators, an administration official said.\n\n\u201cThe president knows this is dead on arrival in the Senate,\u201d Perdue said this week after watching the World Series alongside Trump and other Republicans.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nThe president is largely laying off senators with difficult calculations to make in the coming months, declining to lobby the likes of GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Marco Rubio of Florida, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Johnny Isakson of Georgia. And he\u2019s largely laying off Romney after suggesting he should be impeached and calling him a \u201cpompous 'ass.'\u201d\n\nInstead, White House officials are leaning on Trump\u2019s impromptu meetings at the White House and his direct calls to Republican senators including Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and John Kennedy of Louisiana. It\u2019s a bet the cult of Trump\u2019s personality and the power of his prolific Twitter feed will be enough to keep members within the fold, even as House Democrats quickly gather evidence as part of the impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any organized\u201d effort, Rubio said. \u201cI\u2019m sure if we spoke, he\u2019d bring it up. But I don\u2019t need to talk to him to know his feeling about it. He makes it pretty clear on a regular basis.\u201d Rubio said he would weigh the facts of the impeachment case along with the \u201ctraumatic\u201d decision of removing a president from office a year before an election.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the president has fully gone hands-off. Last Thursday he hosted 10 Republicans in the Situation Room for a meeting on Middle East policy, including several senators who had called his conversation with the Ukrainian president about Joe Biden inappropriate. After the meeting, they gathered in the ornate Roosevelt Room, where Trump vented about impeachment.\n\n\u201cHe said he thought the process was unfair and he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. And he wanted us to know that,\u201d said an attendee, who said Trump neither put pressure on his mild critics nor received any criticism himself. The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt was part of an effort by the president to give senators \u201ca sense of where his gut\u2019s at and where his head\u2019s at,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), who attended the White House meeting last week in the Situation Room.\n\n\u201cHe wants to make sure people understand his argument. His case. And he doesn\u2019t believe he did anything wrong. He thinks the call, as he described it, was perfectly appropriate,\u201d Thune added. \u201cAnd so, I think much of it is just to help our members to better understand a little about where he\u2019s coming from and why he believes that this is a rigged process on behalf of the Democrats.\u201d\n\nShortly after that meeting, Graham released a resolution attacking the House impeachment inquiry. Eventually, the resolution attracted the support of 50 GOP senators, earning an attaboy from Trump on Twitter and amounting to a show of defense for the president around the process, if not the substance, of impeachment proceedings.\n\nAnd Trump continues to engage with rank-and-file senators in unusually personal overtures. Kennedy missed a call from Trump on Tuesday afternoon and tried to call him back while the president was at an event. Trump called back at 11:30 p.m., when Kennedy was asleep; they finally connected Wednesday, Kennedy said. The planned topic was another issue, but of course, impeachment came up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when the president sleeps,\u201d Kennedy said of his manic style. \u201cHe\u2019s not depressed or anything. He just really thinks he\u2019s being treated unfairly.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Current and former senior administration officials say if Republicans can remain united in the House ahead of the Democrats\u2019 vote to proceed with impeachment on Thursday, it portends well for the Senate sticking together.\n\nHouse Republicans\u2019 messaging on the impeachment proceedings, which includes casting it as overly partisan and secretive, will also help guide the way the Senate will proceed, a former Senate leadership aide said. For now, many senators are positioning themselves as impartial by leaning on their future roles as jurors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a juror. So I\u2019m not going to talk about what I might have to do,\u201d said Isakson, who is retiring at the end of the year. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a serious moment in time, and I take it that way,\u201d said Gardner, who said no one from the White House has spoken to him about impeachment strategy. As to how he weighs the evidence he\u2019s seen so far: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to get into that.\u201d\n\nAfter the conversation between Trump and McConnell, the one major shift in the Senate strategy, so far, is that the White House and president have laid off bullying or calling out senators, like Romney, who has criticized Trump\u2019s overtures to foreign leaders to probe Biden.\n\nBashing Romney was a \u201cbig mistake,\u201d the former Senate aide said, because senators serve six-year terms compared with the two-year terms of House members, and take a much longer view politically.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go guns blazing on the Senate,\u201d the former aide said.\n\nIn recent remarks, Trump said the Democrats don\u2019t have any \u201cMitt Romneys\u201d in their midst but declined to go full bore against the 2012 GOP presidential nominee. And Romney said no one from the White House \u2014 including Trump and Pence \u2014 has reached out to him after Trump\u2019s Twitter assault.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice the tweets,\u201d Romney insisted.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/54/9f/c700ac9044d4b071882189e5ae09/191030-donald-trump3-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
