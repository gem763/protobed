Today we were excellent, with fast flowing football. That's Manchester United. We're trying to get back to that,\" Solskjaer said. \"Marcus has that strike in him.\n\n\"I've seen him in training so many times.\"\n\nLampard said Rashford's free kick had been a bolt from the blue.\n\nHe felt the game was theirs for the taking after Batshuayi, scorer of the winner at Ajax last week, ran from the halfway line before holding off a tackle and coolly dispatching a low shot into the bottom corner.\n\n\"No team can stop that,\" he said. \"We weren't at our best in the first half, we were a little slow with our passing, but I loved the first half hour of the second half.\"\n\nChelsea have lost three games at Stamford Bridge in all competitions this season, one more than they did in the whole of the 2018-19 campaign. But Lampard was not too downhearted.\n\n\"I saw a lot of things that were good for us for the future, a lot of positives,\" he said. \"I hate losing, we all do here, but it's clear there is a big picture and there are a lot of big games for us to come and a busy fixture list.\n\n\"Now we move on and focus on what is to come.\"\n\nThe draw for the quarter-finals is on Thursday in which United will be joined by Manchester City, Liverpool, Aston Villa, Leicester City, Everton, Colchester United and Oxford.
