Authorities were still looking for the suspect, Meeks said, and had not yet identified him.\n\nThe shooting took place around midnight Saturday at what Meeks described as a Halloween and homecoming party for Texas A&M University-Commerce, though officials have said it was not a school-sanctioned event. Authorities believe there was one male shooter who entered the venue through the back door and began firing with a handgun, Meeks said.\n\nMeeks described \u201ccomplete chaos\u201d after the shots rang out, with hundreds of people fleeing, including the gunman. Authorities initially had said 14 people were injured, but they later revised that figure.\n\nThe 12 injured included six people who were trampled or hurt by glass in the melee, according to Sgt. Jeff Haines, a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s department. Six others were injured by gunfire. Four of them were in critical condition and one was in good condition Sunday afternoon, he said. He did not know the condition of the sixth person.\n\nThe two people killed were both males, Meeks said. Family members identified one of the victims to local media as Kevin Berry Jr., 23, of Dallas.\n\nAfter a vigil for Berry on Sunday night at a Dallas park, at least one person opened fire. Mourners and reporters on hand for the event took cover and at least one vehicle was struck by bullets, according to local media reports. Multiple gunshots can be heard in a video posted by one reporter. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nUniversity President and CEO Mark Rudin, in a statement on the school\u2019s Facebook page, said four of its students were treated and released from area hospitals. The students were not identified.\n\nRudin said there is \u201ca tremendous amount of misinformation\u201d about the shooting and that counseling services are available to all our students at the university\u2019s counseling center.\n\nAuthorities do not believe the gunman was wearing a mask or costume, Hunt County Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Deputy Buddy Oxford. He added that the shooter was dressed in a blue hoodie.\n\nAuthorities have not found the gun that was used, Oxford said.\n\nThe shooting came as Texas A&M University-Commerce, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northeast of Dallas, celebrated homecoming weekend. According to its website, it is the second-largest university in the Texas A&M University System.\n\nWord of the violence spread online overnight, with many sharing on social media graphic video purported to show seriously wounded victims lying on the ground as crying and screaming could be heard in the background.\n\n\u201cI just briefly saw one that was a very graphic video,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that\u2019s going to help anything at all.\u201d\n\nMeeks said the party was held at a facility called The Party Venue and that the owner was cooperating with authorities. The venue sits along a highway in a rural area some 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) from the Greenville city limits. Meeks said he was not aware of any surveillance video in the area.\n\nOutside the venue Sunday, a few Halloween masks and other debris were strewn about. Pools of blood could be seen on the ground.\n\nKimberly Wilson, 46, was waiting for a tow truck to get her daughter\u2019s car out of a muddy field nearby. She said her 19-year-old daughter had traveled to the party from Dallas. She said her daughter ran when she heard gunshots and that she called a sibling to come pick her up.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s angry, hurt, upset. She\u2019s going through that whole emotional thing,\u201d said Wilson, who is retired from the Army and served in Afghanistan. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve not been trained to deal with something like that \u2014 it just throws you off.\u201d\n\nA patrol sergeant and deputy were at the venue when the shooting happened, having been called there for complaints about illegal parking, Meeks said. An off-duty Farmersville police officer was also there, working as security for the party.\n\nAuthorities were questioning someone who appeared to be intoxicated when they heard gunshots from the back of the building, Meeks said.\n\nMeeks praised the patrol sergeant and deputy, saying the sergeant quickly determined that one of gunshot victims had life-threatening injuries and transported that person to a hospital, while the deputy triaged others until paramedics arrived.\n\nTexas A&M University-Commerce was founded in 1889 and was known by several names, including East Texas State University, before joining the Texas A&M system in 1996. The university has around 6,000 undergraduate students and 4,000 graduate students.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mallika Sen in New York contributed to this report.", "description": "GREENVILLE, Texas (AP) \u2014 A gunman opened fire at an off-campus college party in Texas, leaving two people dead and 12 others injured before he escaped in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/27/9e4669_aptopix-texas-shooting-05940-authorities-work-scene-deadly-shooting-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
