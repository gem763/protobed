Temperatures are set to sink below freezing in Scotland by the middle of the month.\n\nThat means odds on a white Christmas are sure to be slashed with conditions set to get worse as 2020 nears.\n\n(Image: Popperfoto via Getty Images)\n\nCoral spokesman John Hill said: \u201cThe falling temperatures so far this month have prompted an early flurry of bets on us having a White Christmas this year.\n\n\u201cAs always in our White Christmas betting, the Scottish and northern cities in England have the shortest odds on snow fall but we are also seeing bets on London seeing the white stuff this year.\u201d\n\nExacta Weather forecaster James Madden explained why things are about to change.\n\n\u201cOctober is now looking like it will turn out to be colder than average with more of a chance of something wintery setting in through the second half of the month,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong chance of widespread frosts and the chance of snowfall which will set the scene for November.\n\n\u201cThis will pave the way for what is shaping up to be a colder than average winter with some extreme cold weather events.\n\n\u201cWhile these could start to make an impact within the next few weeks they will be particularly troublesome from December onwards.\n\n\u201cSnow events have been few and far between in recent years, but this winter is looking favourable to bring snow event after snow event as weather systems from the Atlantic clash with cold stagnated air over the UK.\n\n(Image: NASA Worldview)\n\n\u201cThis is relevant as solar energy effects ocean currents including the Gulf Stream currents which have a knock-on effect on the jet stream brining cold air in the UK and bringing these weather patterns.\n\n\u201cApplying these factors to long-range weather indications can successfully allow us to identify cold weather patterns coming up.\n\n\u201cSimilar methods have allowed us to identify some previous record-breaking cold weather events such as those seen in 2010 and 2013 when cold weather lasted into spring.\"", "description": "Thermometers will start to fall by the middle of October - and the Met Office is warning of a wet and windy weekend ahead", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Euan Cherry Wenn", "Getty Images", "Popperfoto Via Getty Images", "Nasa Worldview"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14228397.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Spring-weather-3rd-April-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
