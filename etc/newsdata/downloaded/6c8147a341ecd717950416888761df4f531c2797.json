Casino isn't one of them.\n\nInstead, banners draped over hundreds of metres around the construction site contain buzz phrases about bars and apartments.\n\nIt's more politically palatable to be saying you're promoting tourism and building a resort, rather than a casino. \u2014 Stephen Mayne, anti-gambling campaigner\n\nThe consortium\u2019s home internet page about the project does not use the word casino. References to gaming are found deeper in the website. The sole gambling reference in a 3.02-minute promotional video on the main page is when the words \u201cVIP Sky Gaming\u201d appear for three seconds.\n\n\u201cIt's a joke. It's a casino. It's pretty cynical and completely disingenuous,\u201d anti-gambling campaigner Stephen Mayne said.\n\n\u201cIt's a straight marketing ploy. It's more politically palatable to be saying you're promoting tourism and building a resort, rather than a casino.\u201d\n\nStar is paying $1 billion to the Queensland government over the next 15 years as part of the development, which has taken up half a dozen blocks of prime real estate on the Brisbane River's northern banks.\n\nStar, whose annual shareholder meeting will be held on Thursday, is transferring the licence over from its existing Brisbane Treasury casino. But there is a 53 per cent increase in allowable poker machines \u2013 from 1632 to 2500.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt earned 80 per cent of its $721 million in Queensland domestic revenue from gaming last financial year.\n\nMr Mayne said the term \u201cintegrated resort\u201d \u2013 which the government and consortium were using \u2013 had become a code word for a casino and hotel development. It was also crucial in marketing the development in China, where the promotion of gambling is illegal.\n\n\u201cThe integrated resort model was used in Singapore and it absolutely boomed. Other places are trying to not be so overt [about gambling] ... it's the model everyone is using,\u201d he said.\n\nDon't mention the \"c\" word ... an artist's impression of Brisbane's planned $3.6 billion Queen Wharf resort complex. Destination Brisbane Consortium\n\nDaniel Angus, of QUT\u2019s Creative Industries Faculty, which counts linguistics among its specialities, said a \u201csecond language\u201d could be created around certain vice products, such as alcohol or gambling.\n\nThat was to disassociate the new words from negative connotations tied to terms such as gambling. \u201cThey\u2019re loaded terms,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Angus, who travels past the project's banners on the river's edge, said there wasn't \u201ca single picture of a gaming machine\u201d.\n\nAdam Ferrier, a marketing expert who founded agency Thinkerbell, said casino operators might highlight aspects of the project other than gaming to dial-up different revenue-generating activities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re selling the image of an aspirational lifestyle \u2026 or a night out,\u201d he said.\n\nIt made the image more \u201csocially acceptable\u201d than merely sitting around a gambling table, Mr Ferrier said. But people would still be aware \u201cthere\u2019s a casino in town\u201d, he added.\n\nA Financial Review survey of government media statements discussing the project found that the last reference to it being a casino was in December 2017, while another in November last year used the term only in passing because an event was held at \u201cTreasury Casino\u201d.\n\nBridges and cranes\n\nThere have been at least eight other statements since then about the project. At least seven mentioned the 50 bars and restaurants on the site and five mentioned a new bridge. Even the word \u201ccrane\u201d appeared more often than casino.\n\nThat contrasted with earlier messaging on the project. In April 2016, Training and Skills Minister Yvette D\u2019Ath made multiple references to its function as a casino in an announcement about new laws for the development.\n\nDestination Brisbane Consortium declined to answer questions but said the development would deliver significant economic benefits, and drive \u201cdramatic\u201d increases in interstate and international visitation.\u201cThere will be a casino in the integrated resort that replaces the existing Treasury casino ... Brisbane remains a one-casino city,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nThe Queensland government had not responded to questions.", "description": "What casino?
