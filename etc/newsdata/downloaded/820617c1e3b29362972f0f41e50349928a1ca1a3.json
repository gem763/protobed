On Aug. 5 he abolished 70 years of regional autonomy and placed its citizens under widespread restrictions including an extended communications blackout. It also follows India\u2019s push to strip millions of people -- mostly Muslims -- of their citizenship in the country\u2019s northeastern state of Assam, near Bangladesh.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, although not explicit approval, are symbolic of the quiet acceptance of India\u2019s policies which have attracted little international criticism. India\u2019s actions have been compared to what China is doing in its own restive mostly-Muslim border region of Xinjiang. But few countries other than Pakistan and China, which both have territorial claims in disputed Kashmir, have criticized New Delhi -- a stark contrast to the 22 states that signed a letter criticizing China\u2019s crackdown against Muslim minority Uighurs, which has seen as many as 1 million citizens placed in \u201cre-education camps.\u201d\n\nNations want to keep Modi onside as they recognize India\u2019s rising strategic importance in Asia as a counterweight to Beijing. There\u2019s also the size of its market, including billions in arms purchases, and the fact that criticizing New Delhi risks aligning with Pakistan, which is widely accused of sponsoring terrorist groups in the region.\n\n\u201cThere is little diplomatic upside to directly challenging India,\u201d said Paul Staniland, an associate professor at the University of Chicago. \u201cIndia is an important economic and strategic partner, or potential partner, for countries ranging from France to the U.S. to the Gulf states. It\u2019s also clear that the government of India won\u2019t be rolling back its policy anytime soon, and many countries are leery of seeming to back the Pakistani line.\u201d\n\n\u2018Grave Concern\u2019\n\nPakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, whose government denies supporting militants that strike inside India, told Trump on Monday there\u2019s \u201ca huge humanitarian crisis taking place\u201d in the disputed region. He added the U.S. has a responsibility to get involved.\n\n\u201cThis crisis is going to get much bigger, what is happening in Kashmir,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThe United States -- it\u2019s the most powerful country, it can affect the United Nations Security Council, it has a voice, so we look to the U.S. to put out flames in the world.\u201d\n\nModi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has long campaigned on removing Kashmir\u2019s special status, and moved swiftly to enact its plans following a sweeping election victory in May.\n\nBut despite the prolonged detention of political leaders and the deployment of 10,000 extra Indian paramilitary forces, Kashmir\u2019s turmoil has generated only muted global responses. A group of United Nations experts urged India to revoke its communications blackout, while Human Rights Watch has condemned the arbitrary detention of thousands.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s sudden decision has brought our lives to a standstill,\u201d said Javed Ahmed, a 30-year-old fruit seller in the Kashmiri capital of Srinagar, in an interview in late August. \u201cIt is about taking our resources and changing this land forever.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to calls or an email.\n\nA separate group of United Nations experts has expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over a citizenship drive in Assam, where 1.9 million people -- a substantial number of whom are Muslims -- are at risk of being stripped of their national identity. Indian Home Minister Amit Shah has previously called illegal migrants \u201ctermites,\u201d and the UN experts warned the registration process \u201cmay exacerbate the xenophobic climate while fueling religious intolerance and discrimination in the country.\u201d\n\nOne reason Modi\u2019s Kashmir move has not provoked more global outcry, said Kashish Parpiani, a fellow with New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation, is the image India has successfully presented to the rest of the world.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- If Prime Minister Narendra Modi was worried about a frosty reception in the U.S. after his crackdown on India\u2019s Muslim-majority region of Kashmir, President Donald Trump was quick to put those fears to rest.\u201cBorder security is vital to India,\u201d Trump said alongside Modi, as the two spoke", "authors": ["Iain Marlow", "Archana Chaudhary"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B9PK9j40xGMImWia9ojRwA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/d70375fa9ca55afeab58ded79a4402b0", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
