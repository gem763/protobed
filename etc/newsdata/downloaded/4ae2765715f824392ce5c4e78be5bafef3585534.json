(AP Photo/Rick Scuteri)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Josh Rojas, Eduardo Escobar and Christian Walker homered in the sixth inning off converted infielder Javy Guerra and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the San Diego Padres 14-7 on Monday.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have won seven of eight and kept pace in the National League wild-card race at 3 1/2 games behind the Chicago Cubs for the second spot. The Padres had won three of four.\n\nRojas also doubled and singled twice and Ketel Marte drove in four runs for the Diamondbacks.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nA six-run second inning put the Diamondbacks comfortably ahead for good, helped by a wild pitch and throwing error. Rojas, Marte, pitcher Mike Leake (11-10) and Nick Ahmed drove in runs in the inning.\n\nMarte hit his 29th homer, connecting off Padres starter Cal Quantrill (6-6). Quantrill was charged with eight runs on 10 hits in five innings.\n\nDown 8-0, the Padres scored four times in the sixth, highlighted by Ty France's three-run homer. France gave the Padres 105 homers on the road this season, a franchise record.\n\nLeake (11-10) got through 6 1/3 innings and allowed four runs on eight hits for his first win at home with the Diamondbacks after coming over in a trade with Seattle on July 31.\n\nGuerra was a top shortstop prospect in the Padres' system and made his big league debut last year, batting .125 in 13 games. The 23-year-old was switched to a pitcher this year, and had never thrown above the Double-A level before coming in to relieve in the sixth.\n\nGuerra started by striking out Jarrod Dyson, but then Rojas homered. With two outs, Escobar hit his 33rd homer of the season and Walker adding his 25th. Guerra was pulled after giving up a double and a single.\n\nFormer Padres player Abraham Almonte, in his first start for the Diamondbacks, had three hits and scored three runs.\n\nSEPTEMBER ADDITIONS\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth teams made roster moves. The Padres called up RHP Ronald Bolanos from Double-A Amarillo.\n\nThe Diamondbacks called up RHP Jimmie Sherfy from Triple-A Reno on Monday, a day after using seven relievers in a loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nTAKING HITS\n\nThe Diamondbacks' Tim Locastro was hit by a pitch in the eighth inning. He matched a club record for HBPs in a season, 19, tied with Justin Upton in 2011.\n\nBIG CROWDS\n\nThe Diamondbacks drew 141,349 fans for their four-game series with the Dodgers from last Thursday to Sunday, the highest home series total since Labor Day weekend 2003, when they drew about 8,000 more people.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nPadres: LHP Jose Castillo (left middle finger strain) was transferred to the 60-day injured list.\n\nDiamondbacks: RHP Luke Weaver (elbow) threw a simulated game before Monday's first pitch. He's been out since late May.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: Bolanos, primarily a starter in the minors, is in line to make his major league debut in Tuesday's game against Arizona. He was 8-5 with a 4.23 ERA at Amarillo.\n\nDiamondbacks: RHP Merrill Kelly (9-13 4.91 ERA) is set for this fourth career start against the Padres. He's 1-1 with a 7.82 ERA against San Diego.\n\n---------\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports", "description": "PHOENIX (AP) -- Josh Rojas, Eduardo Escobar and Christian Walker homered in the sixth inning off converted infielder Javy Guerra and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the San Diego Padres 14-7 on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/e9oaG9_pliR2jFgPWHZJZQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwMjQ7aD02ODI-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6vZlJHhGx.6kf5sl57KTtw--~B/aD0zNDE7dz01MTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/Sports/ap/201909021608581161850"}
