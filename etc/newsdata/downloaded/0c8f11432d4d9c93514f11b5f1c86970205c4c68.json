GRAINS-Soybeans climb to 16-month high on U.S.-China trade optimism\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Chicago soybean futures gained more ground on Monday with prices hitting a 16-month peak as progress in U.S.-China trade talks underpinned the market.\n\nCorn hit a 2-month high while wheat rose to its highest since mid-July.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS\n\n* The most-active soybean contract Sv1 on the Chicago Board Of Trade (CBOT) jumped to its highest since June 2018 at $9.46 a bushel.\n\n* Corn rose to its highest since Aug. 12 at $4.02-1/2 a bushel and wheat Wv1 touched $5.14-3/4 a bushel, the highest since July 19.\n\n* U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday outlined the first phase of a deal to end a trade war with China and suspended a threatened tariff hike, but officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done before an accord could be agreed. The emerging deal, covering agriculture, currency and some aspects of intellectual property protections, would represent the biggest step by the two countries in 15 months to end a tariff tit-for-tat that has whipsawed financial markets and slowed global growth.\n\n* Soybeans, the largest U.S. crop export to China, have been supported by purchases of U.S. soybeans by China in the run-up to the latest round of trade talks, including a 398,000-tonne sale reported by the USDA on Thursday.\n\n* The market continues to monitor a winter storm bringing blizzard conditions to parts of the Dakotas. Freezing temperatures were expected for Minnesota and Iowa this weekend.\n\n* Large speculators trimmed their net short position in CBOT corn futures in the week to Oct. 8, regulatory data released on Friday showed.\n\n* The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's weekly commitments of traders report also showed that non-commercial traders, a category that includes hedge funds, increased their net short position in CBOT wheat and trimmed their net short position in soybeans.\n\nMARKET NEWS\n\n* Asian share markets pushed higher on Monday as signs of progress in the Sino-U.S. trade standoff whetted risk appetites, while pressuring safe-haven bonds and the yen.
