Biden sat down with ABC News for a wide-ranging interview on his business dealings in Ukraine, his relationship with his father, and a host of other issues raised by anchor Amy Robach.\n\nMr. Biden, who is under fire for his time with Burisma Holdings while his father was in the Obama administration, said talk of cronyism and nepotism doesn\u2019t concern him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all noise,\u201d he said of Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump\u2019s political opinions for the Tuesday exclusive. \u201cWhat they do is they create just an enormous amount of noise. I have to, then, answer questions about accusations made by probably the most unethical group of people that we\u2019ve ever seen in this republic.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Jr. recently told Fox News that it was absurd that his family couldn\u2019t criticize the Bidens, given what he has experienced.\n\n\u201cThis whole notion that family is off-limits, you can\u2019t talk about it, I go: \u2018That\u2019s interesting. Look at what they tried to do to me for three years,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump Jr. told Brian Kilmeade on Oct. 11. \u201cThese clowns tried to put me in jail for three years because I took an unsolicited phone call. The double standard is pretty sick, Brian, and I\u2019ve talked about it for a long time.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden, however, maintains that Mr. Trump\u2019s family is delusional.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t real stuff,\u201d he said, Mediaite reported. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. It truly isn\u2019t. That part of it, that Barnum and Bailey, you know, say anything, do anything you want, you know, I mean, like, you know, Donald Prince Humperdinck Trump Jr. is not something I really care about.\u201d\n\nPrince Humperdinck is a fictional character played by Chris Sarandon in \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
