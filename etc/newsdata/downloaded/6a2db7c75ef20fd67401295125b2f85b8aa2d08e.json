He has a 988-794 career record as a manager, a National League Manager of the Year award with the then-Florida Marlins in 2006 and a World Series title with the Yanks in 2009.\n\n\"I think Joe is a great choice,\" Gabe Kapler, who the Phillies fired in October, told Alex Carr of The Good Phight in reaction to the hire. \"He's smart, adaptable and his record obviously speaks for itself. [...] I believe Joe will guide this team to a lot of success and wish him and the Phillies the best.\"\n\nThe Phillies fired Kapler following an 81-81 season, his second in Philadelphia. The Phillies finished 16 games back of the National League East champion Atlanta Braves and was eight games off the final wild-card spot.\n\nAn improvement of one win fell well short of expectations after the team added Bryce Harper, David Roberstson, J.T. Realmuto, Andrew McCutchen, Juan Nicasio and Jean Segura in the offseason.\n\nHarper summed up Philadelphia's general problems on offense. He had a .260/.372/.510 slash line along with a .365 weighted on-base average. Those numbers aren't bad, but they likely aren't what the Phillies envisioned when they gave the six-time All-Star a record-setting 13-year, $330 million contract.\n\nSegura also posted his lowest WAR (2.3) since 2015, and the team never adequately replaced McCutchen after he tore his ACL in June.\n\nEven if the Phillies' best hitters had delivered, it likely wouldn't have mattered given their dreadful pitching staff. Aaron Nola's FIP rose a full run from 3.01 to 4.03. Jake Arrieta allowed his second-most home runs per nine innings (1.39). And Robertson, who had averaged 65 appearances since 2010, underwent Tommy John surgery in August after having pitched in seven games.\n\nPhiladelphia ranked 23rd in FIP (4.88), 20th in strikeout rate (8.62) and 17th in walk rate (3.38).\n\nAs much as the Phillies spent on their starting lineup, the 2019 season made it clear that they need to invest more this winter in their starting rotation. Even if one argues Kapler didn't get the most out of the roster at his disposal, no manager could've excelled with this staff.\n\nWith what's projected to be MLB's eighth-biggest payroll ($127.7 million), per Spotrac, the Phillies should have the flexibility to land a marquee starter. Perhaps that was part of the team's pitch to land Girardi.\n\nAs the Phillies began to conduct their search for a new manager, many wondered if the result would be a sort of referendum on general manager Matt Klentak.\n\nAfter the Phillies fired hitting coach John Mallee in August, the Philadelphia Inquirer's Scott Lauber questioned whether Kapler's ouster was a sign of ownership starting to lose faith in Klentak and the front office:\n\n\"But in firing Kapler, the Phillies revealed a management team that appears to be at odds, possibly even in a state of dysfunction. For the second time in three months, managing partner John Middleton came off the top rope to direct a personnel decision. And while that's his prerogative after dropping nearly half-billion bucks on roster additions only to remain a postseason outsider for the eighth year in a row, it does raise questions about Klentak's autonomy going forward.\"\n\nThe postseason is clearly the bar for success in 2020, which will immediately put Girardi under the microscope. However, Klentak might be the one on the chopping block next should the Phillies miss the playoffs for a ninth straight year.\n\nGirardi is no stranger to pressure. He spent 10 years in the Yankees' dugout, winning a World Series in 2009 and taking the team to the American League Championship Series in 2010, 2012 and 2017.\n\nIn terms of experience, Girardi is a significant contrast to Kapler. His arrival could signal a general shift in the team's strategic direction as well.\n\nGirardi's more traditional style was one of the reasons the Yankees moved on after the 2017 season and hired the more analytically inclined Aaron Boone. Whereas Kapler was an extension of the front office, Girardi is likely to voice some disagreement with Klentak.\n\nStriking more of a balance between the manager and general manager could be what the Phillies need to get back into the playoff picture.\n\nStats courtesy of FanGraphs unless otherwise noted.", "description": "The  Philadelphia Phillies  agreed to a three-year deal with  Joe Girardi  on Thursday to become their new manager, the Phillies  announced .
