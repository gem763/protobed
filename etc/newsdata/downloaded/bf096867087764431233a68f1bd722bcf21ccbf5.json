He joined al Qaeda in 2006 and was arrested by U.S. forces in 2008 and jailed for four years, according to the Iraqi security officials.\n\nBaghdadi later tasked Ethawi with key roles such as delivering religious instructions and the selection of Islamic State commanders. After the group largely collapsed in 2017, Ethawi fled to Syria with his Syrian wife.\n\nAnother turning point came earlier this year during a joint operation in which U.S., Turkish and Iraqi intelligence agents captured senior Islamic State leaders, including four Iraqis and one Syrian, the Iraqi security officials said.\n\n\"They gave us all the locations where they were meeting with Baghdadi inside Syria and we decided to coordinate with the CIA to deploy more sources inside these areas,\" said one of the Iraqi officials, who has close ties to multiple security agencies.\n\n\"In mid-2019 we managed to locate Idlib as the place where Baghdadi was moving from village to village with his family and three close aides,\" the official said.\n\nInformants in Syria then spotted an Iraqi man wearing a checkered headdress in an Idlib marketplace and recognized him from a photograph, the official said. It was Ethawi, and they followed him to the home where Baghdadi was staying.\n\n\"We passed the details to the CIA and they used a satellite and drones to watch the location for the past five months,\" the official said.\n\nTwo days ago, Baghdadi left the location with his family for the first time, traveling by minibus to a nearby village.\n\n\"There it was his last moment to live,\" the official said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLOCAL ENEMIES\n\nBaghdadi was also on the run from local enemies in Syria.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group formerly known as the Nusra Front and which dominates Idlib, had been mounting its own search for Baghdadi after receiving information he was in the area, according to a commander in an Idlib jihadist group.\n\nThe Nusra Front and Islamic State were rivals who fought bloody battles against each other in the Syrian war.\n\nThe Nusra Front, founded by Abu Mohamad al-Golani, was al Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria until it broke away from the global jihadist network in 2016.\n\nAccording to the Idlib commander, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham recently captured another aide to Baghdadi known as Abu Suleiman al-Khalidi, one of three men seen sitting alongside Baghdadi in his last video message.\n\nThe capture of Khalidi was \"the key\" in the search for Baghdadi, the commander said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ahmed Rasheed"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
