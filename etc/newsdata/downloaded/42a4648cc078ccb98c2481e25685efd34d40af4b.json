She writes that she felt sorry for him, and obliged.\n\nHowever, she was not his only, nor his first alleged victim, and before his attack, he was accused of sexually assaulting another woman. His previous victim filed a police report against him; however, there is no indication what, if any, police action was taken on the matter.\n\nSha Ramson details that one of his victims was a woman whose husband was in Mecca doing umrah (like a mini-Hajj) when the suspect tried to \u201cpersuade\u201d the woman to sleep with him. When her husband returned from abroad, a police report was filed against him.\n\nShe claims that in July 2017, a musyawarah on the matter was held. While she makes no clarification of the parties involved, the term implies a council-ish meeting usually involving community stakeholders.", "description": "After gaining widespread notoriety over a (now taken down) Twitter post describing how he and his wife and (unvaccinated!) toddler spent a sojourn in Europe sleeping mostly on park benches, save for the occasional hotel check-in to shower, wash clothes, and take food from the breakfast buffet, the man", "authors": ["Coconuts Kl"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WuDsg7uUiy5JDXfCApRHtw--~B/aD0zNzQ7dz03MTQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coconuts_kl_272/c47e50475721c832e1c5948dd0990f25", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
