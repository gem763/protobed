What doesn\u2019t need explaining is that if Charles were elected in November 2020, he would become the first Native American president of the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s an extremely long-shot bid. But Charles is also aiming to use his campaign to raise awareness of the historic, and continuing, abuse of Native Americans and other ethnicities, hopefully resulting in an improved constitution that he believes would better reflect the modern-day US.\n\n\u201cDo we want to be a nation where we the people actually means all the people?\u201d Charles says.\n\n\u201cBecause if we do, then we have some foundational level work to do.\u201d\n\nNative American people living on reservations, Charles says, have always been overlooked by politicians. The territory of the Navajo Nation covers 27,000 square miles alone \u2013 enough to make it the 48th largest state in the US. Despite that, Charles says, the territory of 350,000 people is rarely visited by politicians running for president.\n\nCharles is determined to change that with his campaign. He held his first campaign event on the Navajo Nation, at a chapter house \u2013 a communal meeting place \u2013 near Fort Defiance, north-east Arizona. His second event was at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and another at the Denver Indian Center.\n\n\u201cAlmost every state I go to I want my first contact to be with the indigenous nations, the indigenous peoples of that state,\u201d Charles said.\n\n\u201cI really want to connect with them again because I\u2019m coming on to their land to campaign and I want them to know me and to understand who I am and, and why, why I\u2019m there.\u201d\n\nCharles believes he is the best person to lead the country as a whole, but he is also running with some ideas that would specifically help Native Americans, African Americans and other people of color. On the stump he talks a lot about creating a \u201ccommon memory\u201d \u2013 educating people on the atrocities committed in the past and the challenges different races face.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Independent presidential candidate Mark Charles speaks on 20 August 2019 in Sioux City, Iowa.

His idea is modeled on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up in South Africa, after the end of apartheid.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t call ours truth and reconciliation because reconciliation implies a previous harmony, and if you know our history you know that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nIn South Africa the Truth and Reconciliation committee hearings, which allowed both victims and perpetrators to explain their experiences, were broadcast live, in what has been described as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for how a divided society might deal with a violent past. Charles believes his committee could eventually lead to an at least partial rewriting of the US constitution.\n\nCharles said he had the idea for \u201cthat type of conversation years ago\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut I did not know the best way to bring that proposal to the nation. And after observing several presidential campaigns, I realized every four years we have a dialogue about who we are and where we\u2019re going: our presidential campaign cycle.\n\n\u201cSo I felt like this is an important enough of a proposal that it actually could very well be the center of a presidential campaign. So one of my motivations in running for president is to raise this issue of truth and conciliation to the national level.\u201d\n\nCharles grew up in New Mexico, and went to university in California, before spending 11 years living in the Navajo Nation, which is spread across Arizona, Utah and New Mexico.\n\nThree of those years were spent on a remote sheep camp, where Charles and his young family lived in a one-room hogan, a traditional Navajo house, which had a dirt floor, no running water, no electricity and was six miles from the nearest paved road.\n\nCharles isn\u2019t the first Native American to run for the White House. Russell Means, an activist from the Lakota tribe who died in 2012, ran for the Libertarian party nomination ahead of the 1988 election, but came second to the Texas congressman Ron Paul.\n\nIn 2018 there was a breakthrough for Native American women in particular, when Sharice Davids, from Kansas, and Deb Haaland, from New Mexico, became the first Native American women to be elected to Congress. Both Davids and Haaland are Democrats. Charles says he has voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past, but believes his best chance for office is to eschew both parties.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people to think that becauseI\u2019m running as an independent I\u2019m not a serious candidate,\u201d Charles said. He believes he would not clinch the Democratic or Republican nomination \u2013 aside from anything else, he isn\u2019t a member of either party \u2013 but he plans to be on the ballot in all 50 states, and is committed to running all the way through to November.\n\n\u201cIf our country does not begin creating this common memory, and does not make a decision on whether we want to be a place where we the people means all the people,\u201d Charles said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to face these deep racial divides that we\u2019ve had in our country since its founding.\u201d", "description": "Mark Charles knows his bid is a long shot but hopes to shed light on the historic abuse of Native Americans and other ethnicities", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26e3c8143ef377309ffbb50081922f5d841ecfd3/426_674_4441_2664/master/4441.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dedb11978ce27dd8b4a4662182331609", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
