Over the weekend, she posted birthday greetings to Jack Wagner, the veteran actor who brings the bite along with the big heart to judge, Bill Avery on the drama. Erin trusted Bill enough to make him a Godparent to her son, Jack, as Elizabeth on-screen, and in her birthday greeting, she praised that Wagner was \u201csweeter than a giant plate of cookies\u201d on social media.\n\nBirthdays and babies are cause for celebration on \u201cWhen Calls the Heart\u201d and in real life for one of Erin Krakow\u2019s castmates, Andrea Brooks. Like the rest of the cast, Brooks is busy at work shooting Season 7 of \u201cWhen Calls the Heart,\u201d but took time to commemorate one of the most meaningful moments in any woman's life with a stunning maternity photoshoot, featured by Entertainment Tonight on October 4.\n\nThe same day, Entertainment Tonight queried the cast of the drama known as \u201cthe heart of the Hallmark Channel\u201d to declare themselves as \u201cTeam Nate\u201d or \u201cTeam Lucas.\u201d While the question was daunting, Erin Krakow, Andrea Brooks, and more of the cast had a lot to say about their decisions.\n\nWho to choose?\n\nNaturally, the dashing actors in question, Kevin McGarry, as Mountie Nathan Grant, and Chris McNally, as saloon owner Lucas Bouchard, both have to root for the men they portray.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most. We'll keep you updated with all the news you shouldn't miss. TV Shows\n\nThe stars share a playful and robust friendship, however, even wearing T-shirts promoting the other in a cast \u201cteam battle.\u201d McGarry contends that Nathan perhaps needs Elizabeth more than Lucas, but Lucas certainly brings an exciting dimension to the school teacher\u2019s world that she has never experienced.\n\nPascale Hutton and Kavan Smith are the cherished Rosemary and Lee on \u201cWhen Calls the Heart,\u201d and the chosen guardians of her son by Elizabeth.\n\nThe stars come down on the same side in choosing Nathan, but for Pascale, the selection came suddenly. Hutton was sure that Lucas was the one for Elizabeth until the longing gaze in the Season 6 finale, in which Erin Krakow spoke volumes without a word. The look brought a change of heart for Hutton, who now thinks the Mountie might be the one. Kavan Smith thinks the pairing of Elizabeth and Nathan rings true to the original theme of the show and also likes the way the characters \u201cgive each other the gears\u201d (a dash of bickering) a bit more.\n\nJesse and Clara, portrayed by Aren Buchholz and Eva Bourne are, at last, an engaged couple on \u201cWhen Calls the Heart.\u201d While both think the world of Kevin McGarry and his Nathan Grant, they side with Team Lucas for love with Elizabeth. \u201cThey connect with each other on a different level,\u201d Bourne describes.\n\nJack Wagner and Martin Cummins, who portrays the changed businessman, Henry Gowen, go in opposite directions with their picks.\n\nCummins knows his character has to admire the business acumen of Bouchard, while the \u201claw and order\u201d side of Wagner as \u201cWhen Calls the Heart\u2019s\u201d former Sheriff of Hope Valley has to go with Nathan.\n\nErin Krakow insists that \u201cI'm not gonna be a tiebreaker\u201d as the lady in the center of contention and in the eyes of both \u201chandsome and funny\u201d gentleman. She contends that each suitor is \u201cgood and risky\u201d as far as a romantic choice for Elizabeth. She loves the \u201cnew energy\u201d that Lucas brings into her character\u2019s life and the mysterious, \u201cbad boy\u201d reputation that could be exciting. She admires Nathan as a Mountie and a parent, knowing how he will understand Elizabeth\u2019s loss in a very personal way. \u201cI think he really listens,\u201d the actress relates. She doesn't dismiss the generosity of Lucas, either. \u201cHe bought her a library,\u201d she reminds.\n\nLast season on \u201cWhen Calls the Heart,\u201d Erin Krakow portrayed welcoming her child into the world, but for co-star, Andrea Brooks, her baby daughter will be here soon, to stay in her life forever. The lovely actress who portrays Faith Carter chose to design an \u201cempowering\u201d view of her pregnancy in a photoshoot, and the results are stunning.\n\nA beautiful mother\n\nAndrea Brooks is beyond lovely in flowing, fluttering fabrics in her pregnancy photos designed by Vancouver photographer, Liliya Lubenkova. In the striking series, Brooks is in colors from black to browns to white, in satins and lace, all beautifully showcasing her baby daughter within the womb. Brooks was taken by the photographer's talent in creating images that were \u201cfeminine, and at the same time, project an image of confidence and strength.\u201d\n\nBrooks\u2019 character has developed some of the same qualities on \u201cWhen Calls the Heart,\u201d and is now more at ease in her relationship with Dr. Carson Shepherd, played by Paul Greene. Andrea reflected that \u201cI tried to channel my inner Aphrodite\u201d during her photo sessions. The goddess of love certainly seems to be radiating her gift through the actress, in life, and on television.\n\nBrooks and Greene both come down on the side of Team Lucas. Greene can\u2019t forsee Elizabeth going through another fretful relationship with a Mountie, and Brooks likes what Lucas brings to Hope Valley as a newcomer, and \u201che\u2019s got a pocket watch, which is always very dapper.\u201d\n\nThe expectant mommy has been dressing around her beautiful growing bump on \u201cWhen Calls the Heart\u201d but will welcome her beautiful, breathing baby daughter after the drama wraps filming in October.\n\nNo matter who Erin Krakow chooses to have her heart, everyone on \u201cWhen Calls the Heart\u201d can celebrate the joy and love beyond the set.", "description": "The stars are not immune from choosing sides with Elizabeth\u2019s suitors and her castmate glows in new maternity photos.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Cheryl Preston", "Ramon Sanchez", "Read More On The Same Topic Tresa Patterson", "Hawaii Five-O", "Season Episode", "Eddie Tunnels To The Rescue", "Tangled Crooked Brothers", "Sticks With Big Action", "Blasting Excitement In Second Episode Of Season"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/7/os/b_1200x630/erin-krakow-of-when-calls-the-heart-cant-be-a-tiebreaker-between-nate-and-lucas-image-sourcehallmark-channel-youtube_2335553.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
