His very presence in Trump\u2019s cabinet is seen as a significant factor behind the escalating tensions with Tehran in recent months. Bolton regularly urged confrontation, at one point advocating for a missile strike in response to Iran allegedly downing an unmanned US drone. Trump initially approved of the strike before backing out at the last minute.\n\nWhile pulling out of the deal struck by the Obama administration to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program was a central campaign promise, it\u2019s not clear that Trump ever wanted conflict with Iran beyond that. And he has explicitly undercut Bolton by saying the US didn\u2019t want regime change there. Bolton\u2019s departure now creates an opportunity for both sides to step down from the brink, says Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, a think tank based in Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cThe ball is in Iran\u2019s court. For months and months, the suggestion by senior Iranian officials has been that, \u2018If Trump really wants to talk to us, the step he could take is to get rid of John Bolton,'\u201d Vatanka said. \u201cTrump says he disagreed with so much of what Bolton represented. Iran can turn around and say, \u2018We hope you also disagreed with him on the Iran question.'\u201d\n\nTrump said last month that he would be open to meeting Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, and suggested he could also allow short-term loans to help Iran muddle through the country\u2019s economic crisis, brought on in large part by US sanctions. Iran has rejected the possibility of talks until sanctions are lifted, but Vatanka says a meeting at the UN General Assembly later this month is still a possibility.\n\n\u201cI hope that\u2019s something they will consider, because otherwise this is a game of kids taunting each other. There\u2019s nothing wrong with talking,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t take the opportunity, it goes to show that Iran has moved beyond being stubborn.\u201d\n\nIf a meeting does happen, expectations will be very low: \u201cReconciliation is a tough order,\u201d Vatanka said.\n\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world\u2019s most important and interesting news.\n\nMore stories from Quartz:", "description": "The former national security advisor had long called for regime change with Tehran.", "authors": ["Max De Haldevang"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FF3NK8V9mtUA9orMEw6YHA--~B/aD01Nzc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/quartz.com/8861aac79474d8bba08bf119ac367f9f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
