He is one of seven UFC fighters to hold championship titles in two weight classes, one of the greatest box office attractions in combat sports history, and the only mixed martial artist to cross over into boxing and challenge himself against a pound-for-pound great like Floyd Mayweather.\n\nSince McGregor's 10th round stoppage loss to Mayweather, he has fought just once \u2014 a lightweight title fight against Nurmagomedov, a bout he was conclusively beaten in, submitted because of a neck crank in the fourth round.\n\nNurmagomedov returned to the Octagon last month, beating Dustin Poirier by submission at the UFC 242 event in Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe Russian wrestler, undefeated in 28 pro MMA fights, is now attracting comparisons to Mayweather because of his winning run at the top of his sport, combat IQ, and ability to fight his fight and not his opponent's.\n\nRead more: Khabib Nurmagomedov is 3 wins away from becoming the best lightweight the UFC has ever seen, and could retire as 'the Floyd Mayweather of MMA'\n\n\"He is very dominant, that is just a fact,\" Kavanagh said. \"Both of them are undefeated, both of them are very dominant.\"\n\nNurmagomedov is currently without an opponent, but could return in March or April next year.\n\nWith the well-rounded fighter Tony Ferguson the no.1 contender to Nurmagomedov's title, a high-profile bout between the two will likely be next.\n\n\"At this stage of my life, I just like watching contests,\" Kavanagh said. \"I'll watch local amateur fights, I'll watch Khabib and Tony.\"\n\nKhabib Nurmagomedov beat McGregor at UFC 229 last year.

Sylvanie\n\nKavanagh smiled thinking back to Nurmagomedov's bout against McGregor.\n\n\"Only one person in the world has won one round against him, that's Conor,\" he said, reminiscing about the success McGregor enjoyed in the third round, before he was stopped in the fourth.\n\nMcGregor is a 'savant'\n\nKavanagh has previously hinted at personal regrets in the preparation and strategies employed in the Nurmagomedov bout. Rather than worrying too much about negating Nurmagomedov's best assets, Kavanagh said last year the team could have focused more on McGregor's strengths \u2014 striking. He even said last year that a rematch would be a \"huge fight.\"\n\nRead more: Khabib Nurmagomedov doesn't even have a fight scheduled but is keeping fit by swimming against the tide in a cold river in Dagestan\n\nThough Kavanagh is in new facilities \u2014 a 16,000 square foot fight club that has state-of-the-art locker rooms and a sauna that can fit up to 40 people \u2014 McGregor is never far away.\n\nKavanagh trains approximately 40 professional fighters, helping navigate the Bellator prospect James Gallagher to stardom, but McGregor, too, is training hard and his coach says he remains fit, strong, and sharp.\n\n\"I'm his coach, I love mixed martial arts, and I believe he's arguably the best in the world,\" Kavanagh said.\n\n\"I love watching him compete, I learn every time he competes. There's always something new in what he does. He's a savant in this area.\"\n\nAnd though it is the coach who is the teacher and McGregor the pupil, Kavanagh says it is he who is also learning.\n\n\"His technique is sublime. His timing. Everything about what he does is fantastic. I love watching him. I love training him. I learn every time he's on the mat.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nTake a look inside the new and improved Straight Blast Gym where John Kavanagh trains Conor McGregor and James Gallagher\n\nAn Irish boxer is challenging Conor McGregor to 'stay sober' long enough so they can end their war of words and fight for a world title\n\nConor McGregor linked with comeback bouts against 4 fighters only weeks after being considered an 'irrelevant' has-been\n\nA 22-year-old Irishman got his Conor McGregor moment in Dublin's raucous 3Arena, winning in 30 seconds", "description": "\"I love watching him.
