The 25th edition of the annual report was released today by The Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe world average score of 60.8, a 0.3-point setback from last year. Yet that is still the third-highest global score recorded in the history of the Index. Among the 180 countries ranked, scores improved for 81 countries and declined for 92. Seven remained unchanged.\n\nSix economies earned the Index\u2019s designation of \u201cfree\u201d (scores of 80 or above), while the next 88 are classified as \u201cmostly free\u201d (70-79.9) or \u201cmoderately free\u201d (60-69.9).\n\nPolicies that promote economic freedom have, in recent decades, contributed to a doubling of the world economy, the Index editors write. \u201cThis progress has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and cut the global poverty rate by two-thirds,\u201d they add.\n\nYet the number of economically \u201cunfree\u201d economies remains high: 64 are considered \u201cmostly unfree\u201d (50-59.9) and 22 are \u201crepressed\u201d (scores below 50).\n\nPer capita incomes are much higher in nations that are more economically free, the Index editors note. Economies rated \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cmostly free\u201d in the 2019 Index enjoy incomes more than twice the average levels in all other countries, and more than six times higher than the incomes of people living in \u201crepressed\u201d economies.\n\nThe United States continued to improve its standing, recording a score of 76.8, more than a full point above its score in the 2018 Index. It jumped six spots in the global rankings from last year, from No. 18 to No. 12 (and second in the \u201cAmericas\u201d region, behind Canada), thanks in large measure to cuts in taxes and regulations. It remains \u201cmostly free.\u201d\n\nHong Kong and Singapore finished first and second in the rankings for the 25th consecutive year. Three other top 10 finishers \u2013 Australia (5th globally), Canada (8th) and the United Arab Emirates (9th) \u2013 recorded no score change from last year, but New Zealand (3rd), Switzerland (4th), Ireland (6th), and the United Kingdom (7th) all saw their scores rise, along with Taiwan (10th) who joined the top 10 for the first time.\n\nEvery region except sub-Saharan Africa has at least one representative among the top 20 freest economies: 11 in Europe, five in the Asia-Pacific region, three in the Americas, and one in the Middle East/North Africa region.\n\nThe Most Free\n\n1.

Algeria\n\nLaunched in 1995, the Index evaluates countries in four broad policy areas that affect economic freedom: rule of law; government size; regulatory efficiency; and open markets. There are 12 specific categories: property rights, judicial effectiveness, government integrity, tax burden, government spending, fiscal health, business freedom, labor freedom, monetary freedom, trade freedom, investment freedom, and financial freedom. Scores in these categories are averaged to create an overall score.\n\nBased on an average score, each of 180 countries graded in the 2019 Index is classified as \u201cfree\u201d (i.e., combined scores of 80 or higher); \u201cmostly free\u201d (70-79.9); \u201cmoderately free\u201d (60-69.9); \u201cmostly unfree\u201d (50-59.9); or \u201crepressed\u201d (under 50).\n\nThe Index groups the world\u2019s countries into five regions: the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East/North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. Individual rankings and write-ups for each country can be found online at heritage.org/index/ranking.\n\nAmericas (7 economies improved, 23 declined, 2 unchanged):\n\nThe Americas has no \u201cfree\u201d economies. Three ( Canada , Chile , United States ) are \u201cmostly free.\u201d Five ( Ecuador , Suriname , Bolivia , Cuba , Venezuela ) are \u201crepressed.\u201d The remaining 24 are either \u201cmoderately free\u201d or \u201cmostly unfree.\u201d\n\n, , ) are \u201cmostly free.\u201d Five ( , , , , ) are \u201crepressed.\u201d The remaining 24 are either \u201cmoderately free\u201d or \u201cmostly unfree.\u201d Barbados earned the world\u2019s largest overall score increase, 7.7 points, thanks to significant improvements in government spending and fiscal health. The biggest regional drop, however, was Cuba , saddled with the inefficiencies of a state-run economy.\n\nearned the world\u2019s largest overall score increase, 7.7 points, thanks to significant improvements in government spending and fiscal health. The biggest regional drop, however, was , saddled with the inefficiencies of a state-run economy. The rule of law and regulatory efficiency are major problem areas, reflecting long-standing weakness in the protection of property rights, ineffectiveness in the judiciary, and lack of government integrity.\n\nAsia-Pacific (23 economies improved, 18 declined, 2 unchanged):\n\nFour of the world\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d economies are in this region ( Hong Kong , Singapore , Australia , New Zealand ), but so are four \u201crepressed\u201d economies ( Turkmenistan , Kiribati, Timor-Leste, and North Korea ).

Five are \u201cmostly free\u201d ( , , , and ). Many of the Asia-Pacific countries are performing well in controlling the size of government, maintaining the rule of law, and regulating economic activity efficiently, the Index editors note. The region continues to lead worldwide economic growth, with average annual expansion of approximately 6.3 percent over the past five years driven largely by China, India and other market-oriented economies.\n\nEurope (21 economies improved, 21 declined, 2 unchanged, 1 ungraded):\n\nSixteen of the world\u2019s 35 freest economies (overall scores above 70) are in this region, and two of the six world economies rated as \u201cfree\u201d ( Switzerland and Ireland ).\n\nand ). Most of Europe\u2019s economies rated either \u201cmostly free\u201d or \u201cmoderately free.\u201d Five\u2014 Moldova , Russia , Belarus , Greece and Ukraine \u2014are \u201cmostly unfree.\u201d\n\n, , , and \u2014are \u201cmostly unfree.\u201d Relatively extensive and long-established free-market institutions in a number of European countries allow the region to score far above the world average in most measures of economic freedom. However, it still struggles with numerous policies that hamper expansion, such as overly protective and costly labor regulations, high tax burdens, and various market-distorting subsidies.\n\nMiddle East/North Africa (6 economies improved, 5 declined, 2 unchanged, 4 ungraded):\n\nThe Middle East/North Africa has no \u201cfree\u201d economies. Three ( United Arab Emirates , Qatar and Israel ) are \u201cmostly free,\u201d but most of the other 11 graded economies are either \u201cmoderately free\u201d or \u201cmostly unfree\u201d (and one, Algeria , is repressed).\n\n, and ) are \u201cmostly free,\u201d but most of the other 11 graded economies are either \u201cmoderately free\u201d or \u201cmostly unfree\u201d (and one, , is repressed). Despite exports of crude oil, overall trade flows in the region remain very low.

Middle East/North Africa does lead the world in one area, however: tax burden. Its score on this Index factor beats the world average by more than 10 points.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa (23 economies improved, 24 declined, 1 ungraded):\n\nSub-Saharan has no \u201cfree\u201d economies. A majority of its 47 graded nations are \u201cmostly unfree,\u201d and more than half of the world\u2019s \u201crepressed\u201d economies (12 out of 22) are in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nRwanda\u2019s 2-point improvement enabled it to join Mauritius in the ranks of the \u201cmostly free.\u201d Uganda \u2019s 2.3-point drop, on the other hand, pushed it into the \u201cmostly unfree\u201d category.\n\nin the ranks of the \u201cmostly free.\u201d \u2019s 2.3-point drop, on the other hand, pushed it into the \u201cmostly unfree\u201d category. The population-weighted average GDP per capita is only $4,005, the lowest level for any region. Unemployment hovers at 7.5 percent.\n\nThe single factor where Sub-Saharan Africa scores above the world average is government spending. But the region is plagued with a weak rule of law, inadequate protection of property rights, cronyism and endemic corruption.\n\n\u201cNo alternative systems\u2014and many have been tried\u2014come close to the record of free-market capitalism in promoting growth and enhancing the human condition,\u201d the editors write. \u201cThe undeniable link between economic freedom and prosperity is a striking demonstration of what people can do when they have the opportunity to pursue their own interests within the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe 2019 Index was edited by Ambassador Terry Miller, Director of Heritage\u2019s Center for International Trade and Economics; Anthony B.
