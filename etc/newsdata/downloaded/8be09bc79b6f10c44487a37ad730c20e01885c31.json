In order to finish the tournament early Monday morning in Japan, the players started the fourth round after the third. Woods played 11 holes before play was suspended due to darkness. He was 2 under on the round (18 under overall), three shots ahead of Hideki Matsuyama.\n\nFollow Woods\u2019 final round with shot-by-shot analysis below.\n\nZozo Championship: Leaderboard | Best photos\n\nHole 18 \u2013 Par 5\n\n3-wood off the tee here on (what should be) the final hole the Big Cat and it\u2019s perfect. Down the middle. Center cut. He\u2019s gonna do it.\n\nHole 17 \u2013 Par 4\n\nGRIP IT. RIP IT. TWIRL IT. Tiger pures this one down the left side of the fairway. Useful. Does he know Hideki missed his birdie putt? Tiger looked like he just aimed this one for the middle of the green, which is where he landed. If so, very conservative, leaving a long putt for birdie. He lags this one to within two feet, taps in for par and heads to the 18th with a two-shot lead. It\u2019s happening.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 2 under thru 17 (18 under overall).\n\nHole 16 \u2013 Par 3\n\nThe iron swing is sweet as can be this week. He finds the green here on 16, about 20 feet from the cup. This will be a similar line to the putt Hideki just made for birdie, just a few feet longer. Nothing to see here at all. Two-putt par. Awful effort on the birdie putt to be honest but, two-up with two to play. Let\u2019s get weird.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 2 under thru 16 (18 under overall).\n\nHole 15 \u2013 Par 4\n\nPulls driver here and this one leaks into the first-cut rough. Should be a fine lie from there with a chance to go for the pin here. B-e-a-utiful shot comes up about six feet short of the hole. He can\u2019t believe this putt didn\u2019t drop. I can\u2019t believe that putt didn\u2019t drop. Had an ounce of break he didn\u2019t account for, leaving a tap-in par. Hideki just made birdie. Two-shot lead. Three to play. Moving on.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 2 under thru 15 (18 under overall).\n\nHole 14 \u2013 Par 5\n\nFive holes left. Two par 5s, two par 4s, one par 3. Cuts this one off the tee down the fairway perfectly. Hideki is up on the green with a birdie putt, and I\u2019ve gotta say, it looks like an absolute zoo out there. The biggest galleries by far have been Tiger and Hideki\u2019s, you honestly can\u2019t tell the difference between the two size-wise.\n\nHis approach with a fairway metal is a miss to the right. He\u2019s in the rough with some work to do to get to the green. Think we\u2019re playing for par here. Hideki missed the putt, so as of now, the lead is still two. Solid approach from there runs onto the green and releases to, let\u2019s say, just inside 20 feet? He got a pretty decent read from Gary Woodland and Keegan Bradley\u2019s putts and he walked this one in for birdie. No emotion. No celebration. Strictly business.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 2 under thru 14 (18 under overall).\n\nHole 13 \u2013 Par 3\n\nHe\u2019s not going away quietly. Tiger goes pin-seeking here at No. 13 after giving a shot back and lands this one inside eight feet below the hole. Uphill birdie putt awaiting. For how good of an effort that was off the tee, it was equally as bad on the green. Took his time reading it but never gave it a shot to drop. Disappointing par. Two-shot lead still, should be three.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 1 under thru 13 (17 under overall).\n\nHole 12 \u2013 Par 4\n\nSHOWTIME, FOLKS. Back in his red shirt/black vest combo, which worked like a charm yesterday. He begins with a driver down the left side that lands in the rough and takes a member\u2019s bounce into the fairway. If that\u2019s foreshadowing, I\u2019ll quote the great theologian Porky Pig: That\u2019s all, folks. 211 yards to the flag and ohhhhh boy he slammed his club immediately. He hasn\u2019t shown that kind of emotion all week long. It\u2019s shocking he just missed the green there with how good his iron play has been.\n\nHe\u2019s in the bunker guarding the front of the green, but has plenty of room to work with. The out is clean from the sand but it just doesn\u2019t climb up onto the ledge where the pin sits, and rolls back and further away from the cup. That\u2019s a good 30-plus feet left for par. Lags this one up to a few feet, missing low and left. That\u2019s a bogey. He\u2019s known to start slow, but, not ideal today.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 1 under thru 12 (17 under overall).\n\nHole 11 \u2013 Par 4\n\nAnother driver into the rough. Just isn\u2019t as polished as he was the first two rounds off the tee. From the rough his approach comes up short again. From there he hits a gorgeous chip to set up a tap-in par. That\u2019s the final hole of the day.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 2 under thru 11 (18 under overall). Leads by three.\n\nHole 10 \u2013 Par 4\n\nTo start the back we\u2019ve got a fairway metal off the tee and it\u2019s into the right rough. Should be okay over there. He went pin-seeking here but winds up 20-plus feet after the roll. Really caught that one clean. Two putt par, solid effort from there to clean up the hole and keep his five-shot lead.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 2 under thru 10 (18 under overall).\n\nHole 9 \u2013 Par 4\n\nThe lead is now five and just like on No. 8, TW\u2019s drive finds the fairway. His approach is just as nice, right at the flag. Shall we close out the first nine of the final round with a birdie? Oh. We shall not. Just misses this one, but hey, two-putt par.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 2 under thru 9 (18 under overall).\n\nHole 8 \u2013 Par 4\n\nDriver here on No. 8 finds the right side of the fairway. When he hits fairways \u2026 he makes birdie \u2026 just saying. He puts some English on this approach and spins back to inside 15 feet. But guess what? It\u2019s another two-putt par, because why not?\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 2 under thru 8 (18 under overall).\n\nHole 7 \u2013 Par 3\n\nMiddle of the green here with his tee shot. It\u2019s a birdie chance, uphill, just he way he likes \u2019em. Pace and line didn\u2019t quite match, but both were solid. Two-putt par. He\u2019ll take that all day long.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 2 under thru 7 (18 under overall).\n\nHole 6 \u2013 Par 5\n\nBack to the driver and this one is nice and smooth down the fairway. He goes for the green in two here and misses to the left with a fairway metal. He winds up in a retention area left of the green, with an uphill chip awaiting. Could get frisky here. He\u2019s shortsided, not much to work with, and still manages to get inside five feet. Anotha one (DJ Khaled voice, a reference only like 10 of you reading will probably understand). Birdie. Four shots up.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 2 under thru 6 (18 under overall).\n\nHole 5 \u2013 Par 3\n\nHere we go! Tiger has a chance to bounce back after a perfect tee shot here on the first par 3 of his final round. He sticks it inside 8 feet and cans the birdie putt. Nobody this weekend is hitting their irons like Tiger.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 1 under thru 5 (17 under overall).\n\nHole 4 \u2013 Par 4\n\nTiger\u2019s a man of the people on this hole, blasting his driver into the gallery on the right. His recovery is nice, but comes up short. Time to scramble again. No beating around the bush here: The chip was a poor effort and the par putt misses. Bogey.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: Even thru 4 (16 under overall).\n\nHole 3 \u2013 Par 3\n\nWe\u2019re testing the short game here on the par-3 third. The tee shot misses the green, so he\u2019ll need to scramble for this par. His chip is pretty solid, but it\u2019s a couple feet away. Just outside the friendship gimme zone if you\u2019re playing with your friends. He converts. Moving on.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 1 under 3 (17 under overall).\n\nHole 2 \u2013 Par 4\n\nTiger goes iron here on No. 2 and boy is it perfect. His approach on is inside 20 feet, probably closer to 15. Let\u2019s see if the putter is still hot. Nope. This one slides past and he taps in for par.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 1 under 2 (17 under overall).\n\nHole 1 \u2013 Par 4\n\nWe start the final round with a fairway metal and it\u2019s in the short stuff. His iron play stays hot and he sticks this one to seven feet and cans the birdie. This tournament is his to lose. Leads by three.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 1 under 1 (17 under overall).\n\nWarm-up\n\nDid you miss Tiger Woods\u2019 third round 4-under 66 on Saturday night?
