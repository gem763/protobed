The company indicated that more than 60 federal agricultural food inspectors had benefited from the bribes.\n\nPolice said the funds were paid in kind, via healthcare plans and even dummy contracts signed with legal entities that represented the individuals in some way.\n\nThis is the fourth phase of \u2018Operation Weak Meat\u2019 launched in March 2017, which initially threw Brazil\u2019s animal protein sector into crisis with reports of irregularities in the supervision of refrigerators, leading many countries to temporarily suspend purchases of Brazilian products.", "description": "Brazilian police said on Tuesday they had opened the next phase in a corruption investigation into an unnamed meatpacking company accused of bribing food inspectors with 19 million reais ($4.6 million) in illegal payments.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
