Most of all, it was a missed opportunity.", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nIf you didn\u2019t watch the Washington Redskins game on Sunday, if previous experience convinced you to do something less painful, like drop a bowling ball on your foot, then you might think that Washington\u2019s NFL team could take constructive messages from their 32-27 loss to the heavily-favored Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field. But you would be wrong.\n\nWhether you listened to the frustrated, disgusted Washington coaches and players themselves, or just looked at the ugly numbers, the conclusion was simple: The Redskins had a golden chance for a stunning season-starting win, leading 17-0 in the second quarter. But that chance turned to lead as the Eagles outscored them 32-3, and outgained them by an unfathomable 373-to-80 in the next 31 minutes.\n\nWhen the moment of crisis came, the Eagles woke up and the Redskins fell out of bed.\n\nNew Redskin quarterback Case Keenum was asked innocently if, \u201cresults aside,\u201d he could take some satisfaction in his first game with a new team \u2014 which included 380 yards passing and three touchdowns. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to say, \u2018Results aside,\u2019\u201d said Keenum. \u201cUp 17-0, we gotta win.\u201d\n\n[Even after a demoralizing collapse, Redskins remain upbeat about loss to Eagles]\n\nIn the NFL, that is always going to be the brutally honest takeaway from this game. Unless your team is horrible, and your foe is great, then you\u2019re always going to believe that a 17-point lead should almost always be turned into a win.\n\nThe Redskins didn\u2019t even come close to winning. In fact, they ended up being dominated. As the Eagles ran to their locker room at halftime, trailing 20-7, many of their loyal fans stood and jeered them, giving the thumbs down sign. Yet just one play into the fourth quarter, Philadelphia was ahead by two scores \u2014 29-20 \u2014 and their happy fans were talking Super Bowl chase again.\n\nIf one play could have turned this game back in Washington\u2019s direction, it was a wide-open deep route in the third quarter run by extremely impressive rookie Terry McLaurin at a point when Washington trailed only 21-20. McLaurin had already caught a 69-yard touchdown heave, the longest of Keenum\u2019s career, and this would have been a 75-yard cakewalk score. But Keenum overthrew him by a shockingly wide margin for an NFL vet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like it back,\u201d said Keenum.\n\nThat\u2019s what the whole Washington team will be left saying about this chance for a sterling start to a year when their first five foes are so tough they could play well and still be 1-4. This was the game that might\u2019ve made that start more like 2-3 and taken heat off sixth-year Coach Jay Gruden, for whom the clock is ticking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a total team loss,\u201d said a tense, agitated Gruden, speaking so rapid-fire he hardly sounded like his normal hard-to-ruffle self. Of his team\u2019s utter domination \u2014 which was 304 yards to 30 during one span in the second half \u2014 Gruden said, \u201cWe never had the ball. They held the ball. \u2026 The penalties in the second half killed three drives in a row.\n\n\u201cWe can help the defense for sure by avoiding those penalties and staying on track. But the defense can help us out by getting off the field and maybe creating a turnover sometimes,\u201d said Gruden sharply of a defense that caused no turnovers and only had one sack (for zero yards) of Carson Wentz, who shredded them for 313 yards and three touchdowns on 28-for-39 passing.\n\nThis was a day when no one was going to escape the lash, especially since two Eagles touchdown bombs of 51 and 53 yards went to ex-Redskin wide receiver DeSean Jackson who\u2019s had the longest average-gain-per-catch in the NFL for three of the last five years and is the most notorious deep-threat specialist in the game. Somebody want to cover this guy?\n\n\u201cOne of them was a miscommunication. The other was a great throw,\u201d said Gruden. \u201cDeSean is DeSean. But we should have been there in better position. You never blow a coverage when number 10 is on the field. If you\u2019re going to blow it, you\u2019re going to err on the side of covering him [too closely and drawing a penalty]. That\u2019s inexcusable on our part as coaches.\u201d\n\n[Svrluga: With Adrian Peterson, Redskins have two options: Play him, or set him free]\n\nWithout doubt, the player to whom Gruden dealt the harshest blow \u2014 perhaps unintentionally, but unforgettably \u2014 was future Hall of Famer Adrian Peterson, who helped save the team\u2019s offensive credibility with a 1,000-yard off-the-scrap-heap rushing season last year. On Sunday, Peterson was left off the active list for the first time in his career, so young Derrius Guice could carry the load (18 yards).\n\nWhen will Peterson play again for Gruden? \u201cIf we have a game where we think we can run the ball 55 times in I-formation, then sure, I\u2019ll get him up,\u201d said Gruden. In the modern NFL, there will be no such game. Gruden may not have meant \u201cWhen hell freezes over,\u201d but that\u2019s what it sounded like.\n\nJackson, the man who ignited the Eagles\u2019 comeback, said he wanted to make the Redskins pay for not keeping him. He told his Eagles teammates at halftime: \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take one play\u201d to get back to trailing only 20-14. Then, he took out his barb: \u201cAnybody going into halftime up 17 points will think they have the game won.\u201d\n\nAs disappointing as the loss might have been for the Redskins, it may also have revealed a solution to one of the team\u2019s longest-running problems \u2014 its inability to draft a top wide receiver for more than 25 years, while wasting numerous top picks on busts like 2016 first-round pick Josh Doctson, who was cut last week. The answer may be here: McLaurin, the 6-foot, 210-pound speedster from Ohio State.\n\n\u201cSince Terry walked in the building I\u2019ve known he was an amazing player. The sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d said tight end Vernon Dean who, despite his 35 years and 14 NFL seasons, entirely hurdled over Eagle cornerback Ronald Darby, refused to be dragged out of bounds by another defender and sprinted 48 yards for the team\u2019s first score. \u201cTerry\u2019s also got good practice habits and a great attitude.\u201d\n\n[Terry McLaurin stars, and more takeaways from Redskins\u2019 loss to Eagles]\n\nCertainly, McLaurin already has polish and blue-suit style, managing to carry himself and sound like a new star, yet without doing anything a rookie shouldn\u2019t do.\n\n\u201cCase is a veteran quarterback and he makes it very easy for a rookie like me. He\u2019s very clear in what he wants [from receivers]. I have to keep earning his respect,\u201d said McLaurin, who caught five passes on seven targets for 125 yards. But, remember, it should have been six for 200 yards.\n\nThe second half of this game, in which the Redskins padded some stats and cut the deficit by scoring with four seconds left, showed the worst of the team\u2019s past habit of making the worst of situations.\n\nBut Keenum\u2019s competence and McLaurin\u2019s dash, along with a defense that should be much better than its second-half drubbing, gives reasonable prospects for this team \u2014 predicted by many to be among the worst in the NFL \u2014 to compete with all but the very best teams on its schedule.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to get easier,\u201d said offensive tackle Morgan Moses who was guilty of a pair of damaging penalties. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Dallas and a Monday night game [against Chicago] coming up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be easy. If this game is the first measure, it\u2019s not going to be impossible, either.", "description": "Washington\u2019s 2019 season won\u2019t be easy, but Sunday showed it won\u2019t be impossible, either.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist", "September At Pm", "Tom Boswell Has Been A Washington Post Sports Columnist Since He Started At The Post In As A Copy Aide", "He Spent Years As A General-Assignment Reporter", "Covering Baseball", "Golf", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Boxing"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_kgpjSHrrh2P8qTqnXlO7xNUT_E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RBECOTGSPMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
