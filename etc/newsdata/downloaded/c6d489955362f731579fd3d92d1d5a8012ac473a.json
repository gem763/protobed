The 37-year-old American steamrollered Elina Svitolina 6-3, 6-1 on Arthur Ashe to reach her fourth major final since becoming a mother two years ago.\n\nShe lost the previous three, including that acrimonious match with Naomi Osaka here last year, as well as two Wimbledon finals, meaning she remains tantalisingly one short of Margaret Court\u2019s record tally of 24 grand slams. On this form and in this mood \u2013 and barring another 2018-style meltdown \u2013 she does not look like falling short again.\n\nNow it falls to teenager Bianca Andreescu, a 7-6(3), 7-5 winner over Belinda Bencic, to attempt to emulate Osaka, Angelique Kerber and Simona Halep and beat Williams in the final.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cTo be in yet another final, it seems honestly crazy,\u201d said Williams. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really expect too much less. I think it was solid. It definitely wasn\u2019t my best tennis. She probably could have played better, as well. I definitely know I could have played better. I\u2019m just focusing on not that, just the next match.\u201d\n\nThe victory was her 101st at the US Open, matching the record held by Chris Evert.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool. I didn\u2019t know that was even an option,\u201d she added. \u201cThat always makes it even more special when you hear those super cool things without even knowing.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Day 11 Serena Williams came past Elina Svitolina to reach yet another US Open final Getty Images 52/52 Day 11 Bianca Andreescu beats Belinda Bencic in the semi-finals Getty Images\n\nEarlier, Svitolina had boyfriend Gael Monfils firing down serves at her on the practice court beforehand to prepare for the power of Williams, and had a clear game plan to move the American around the court. But Williams crashed 34 winners past the Ukrainian fifth seed, who beat Britain\u2019s Johanna Konta in the quarter-finals.\n\nSvitolina forced three break points in the opening game, before Williams held. She then faced six deuces on her own serve as the six-time champion made the breakthrough.\n\nIt was a high-level start from both players. The spectators waiting for the first changeover to take their seats were still stood in the concourse after 20 minutes. Svitolina should have been 2-0 up, but before she knew it she was 3-0 down, and the first set was wrapped up in 41 minutes.\n\nA second Williams break arrived at 1-1, the veteran outlasting 24-year-old Svitolina in a 14-shot rally. She repeated the dose in the fifth, even surprising herself with a stunning get at the net to bring up three more break points. She needed just the one, and then ran away with the match, a backhand winner putting Svitolina out of her misery after just 70 minutes.\n\nSvitolina, also a semi-finalist at Wimbledon this year, said: \u201cThat\u2019s why she is who she is. You are playing in front of the best tennis player in the world. If you don\u2019t take it, she just grabs it and there\u2019s no chance to take it back.\u201d\n\nAndreescu, the 19-year-old Canadian, has risen from 152 in the rankings at the start of the year to 15th. She took a tight first set against 13th seed Bencic, of Switzerland, on a tie-break and then came from two breaks down to snatch the second for a 7-6 (3) 7-5 win.\n\nAndreescu, making her debut in the main draw at Flushing Meadows, said: \u201cif someone told me a year ago I\u2019d be in the final this year I (would) have said you were crazy. It\u2019s just surreal. It\u2019s a dream come true playing against Serena in the final of the US Open. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Serena Williams is back in the US Open final for another crack at equalling the all-time grand slam record.
