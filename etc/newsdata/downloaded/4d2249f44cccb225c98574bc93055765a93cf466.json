You can't tell me what motivated the new policy, and you can't tell me what the new policy is. Is that a correct assessment of the situation?\" asked Raskin.\n\n\"That is my testimony, sir, yes,\" replied Renaud.\n\nCommittee officials later requested documentation on the policy, but were told by DHS officials that their request \"cannot be considered by us as a Chairman\u2019s letter.\u201d\n\nA week later, Cuccinelli wrote Raskin that DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan had directed USCIS to return to the deferred action process in place before Aug. 6.\n\nIn that letter, Cuccinelli refused Raskin's invitation to testify before the committee, saying the deferral policy issue is \"a resolved issue.\"\n\nStill, Cummings wrote that he will go ahead with the subpoenas, as Democrats believe McAleenan's new directive is unclear on who may receive deferred action, and the question of how the policy initially came about remains unanswered.", "description": "The\u00a0chairman\u00a0of the House Oversight and Reform Committee announced Thursday he will issue subpoenas next week for official accounts of a Trump administration policy to end deportation deferrals for humanitarian reasons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cummingselijah_062619gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
