Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\nMREs replaced the older Meal, Combat, Individual Rations (MCI) in the early 1980s and served as the preferred self-contained, individual field ration for decades. The on-the-move First Strike Ration became an option for troops in 2007. The future is the CCAR.\n\nEach CCAR ration offers up to 3,500 calories, sufficient for a 24-hour period.\n\nTo get the same amount of calories, a soldier would need to consume roughly three Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MREs) or one First Strike Ration, which is a little larger than one MRE. One CCAR, however, weighs 40% less than a MRE and more nutritious.\n\nIn an expeditionary environment, soldiers can easily carry seven days of meals, as seven CCAR packs are much easier to work with than 21 MREs.\n\nIn this Army graphic, it is easy to see the difference between the MRE and the CCAR with regard to squad supply demands.\n\nA photo of an Army graphic showing the difference between the MREs and the CCARs. Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\nThe Army is looking at field-testing the CCAR next year and possibly fielding it as a replacement for the First Strike Ration by 2023.\n\nSo far, the service has primarily been conducting taste-testing, and the soldier response has been positive, an Army spokesperson told Business Insider at AUSA, adding that while the CCARs may not be as diverse as the MREs, there will still be menu options.", "description": "An Army official said it was \"a significant improvement in combat feeding\" and soldiers will be able to carry seven days of meals for the first time.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da7a8644af909508479ecc2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
