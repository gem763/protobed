In a 2018 American Civil Liberties Union study, Rekognition incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress, including Markey, to a database of 25,000 publicly available arrest photos.\n\nMarkey cited civil liberties concerns about \"countless bystanders who may be unaware that they are being filmed\" by Ring cameras.\n\nRing products include at-home camera surveillance systems and a social network called Neighbors for users to share and discuss footage captured on its cameras.\n\nMarkey asked Bezos for a list of all law enforcement entities with access to Ring footage, and for the company's plans to add facial recognition technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Bryan Pietsch; Editing by Richard Chang)", "description": "U.S. Democratic Senator Edward Markey raised concerns on Thursday that law enforcement use of Amazon.com Inc's Ring doorbell camera in investigations could disproportionately affect people of color and encourage racial profiling.
