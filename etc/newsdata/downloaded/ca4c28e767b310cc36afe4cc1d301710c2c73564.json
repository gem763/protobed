Rather than encourage distance from an unpopular president, McCarthy wants Republicans to stick close to President Trump \u2014 an intentional break from the previous tension that existed between the White House and his predecessor, Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), a close McCarthy friend.\n\nMcCarthy has studied the Democratic field and believes Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is the most likely 2020 nominee, something Trump has been hinting at lately, including in his remarks here to GOP lawmakers Thursday.\n\n\u201cTrump is going to expand the playing field. If Elizabeth Warren comes in, the playing field grows,\u201d McCarthy said in a 40-minute interview here on the second day of the three-day GOP policy retreat. He sees Warren\u2019s liberal positions as a chance for a presidential contest pitting \u201csocialism vs. freedom.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a calculus with much peril. After 12 years as a leadership lieutenant, McCarthy is gambling his standing atop this caucus on the combustible Trump.\n\nHouse GOP\u2019s suburban slide a worrisome trend for party despite narrow N.C. win\n\nThe Democratic 40-seat gain last fall was anchored around suburban battlegrounds that despise the president. Trump\u2019s problems with female voters have only grown worse \u2014 a Washington Post-ABC News poll found just 30 percent approving of his job performance.\n\nAdding to that environment, 17 Republicans have already announced their intention to retire, resign or seek another office, the sort of exodus that would not happen if they believed in a quick return to the majority.\n\nAt the center of this political storm sits McCarthy, 54, who entered Congress in 2007 as the eager understudy to Ryan and Eric I. Cantor (R-Va.). Together, they were the self-branded \u201cYoung Guns\u201d who promised to \u201cchange the face of the Republican Party\u201d in a book released nine years ago Saturday.\n\nIn 2010, after a recruiting effort led by McCarthy, Republicans swept into power with tea party energy. Slowly but surely, however, they fell victim to a political environment they helped create, with Cantor, then majority leader, losing a 2014 primary to a more conservative challenger.\n\nAfter tea party Republicans blocked McCarthy\u2019s elevation, Ryan rose to speaker in 2015, only to see his legacy erased by Trump\u2019s victory in turning the GOP away from Ryan\u2019s vision of free trade and a more diverse coalition.\n\nNow McCarthy is the only one left, essentially a middle-aged \u201cgun.\u201d Almost all his friends from those first years in Congress are gone, including several fellow Californians swept out in a backlash against Trump.\n\n\u201cIs this the beginning of my career? No,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cBut am I better suited, been tested more, learned more, then, for this moment right now? Yeah.\u201d\n\nThis job, he said, uniquely fits his skill set. His main tasks are raising money and recruiting candidates, and he began 2019 by raising $21 million in the first quarter, believed to be the largest early haul ever by a House leader.\n\nAn early aspirant to leadership, rather than a lawmaker rising in the committee ranks, McCarthy has never been viewed as a policy wonk. But life in the minority provides no real opportunities to shape legislation anyway.\n\nSo McCarthy is back to his roots, when he served as a traveling political salesman coaxing the next generation of Republicans to run when the GOP was completely shut out of power a decade ago.\n\nAlways obsessed with metrics, he used to track how many Democrats voted for at least two of three major pieces of Obama-era legislation \u2014 the economic stimulus, a climate bill and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 to predict 2010 outcomes.\n\nHe loves random factoids. The House majority had flipped in 1994 and 2006 when former NFL players won seats, so in 2010 he recruited a former Philadelphia Eagle to run for a seat in southern New Jersey. In 2018, Democrats won as Rep. Colin Allred (D-Tex.), a former NFL linebacker, flipped a GOP seat outside Dallas, continuing the somewhat random trend.\n\nToday, McCarthy knows that there are more 28-year-olds in America than any other age, and that he\u2019s already served the same amount of time in elected leadership posts as Ryan and Cantor combined, almost nine years.\n\nMcCarthy believes Republicans start the 2020 campaign with 55 initial targets: 31 Democrats in districts that favored Trump in the 2016 election and continuing with the seats that GOP nominees won in 2012 and 2008.\n\nSome colleagues believe that McCarthy might be their only hope for crafting a strategy to win suburban battlegrounds with Trump at the top of the ticket focusing on culture wars.\n\n\u201cKevin\u2019s strength is knowing these districts and knowing the type of candidates it\u2019s going to take to win these districts, and really trying to broaden the umbrella of the party while still making sure that we\u2019re representing those Trump voters,\u201d Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) said.\n\nHouse GOP women confront a political crisis \u2014 their party is mostly men\n\nStefanik emerged last November as a leading critic of leadership\u2019s failure to advance Republican women in primaries and then fully support those who made it to the general election, reaching 25-year lows of female Republicans in the House.\n\nShe gave McCarthy good grades so far, particularly after female candidates comprised a majority of the initial wave of \u201cYoung Gun\u201d endorsements for the first time ever with the GOP campaign arm.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s original image of being everyone\u2019s best friend in leadership? He wants that banished. He plans a full-force push to get diverse candidates to win the nomination, believing his positive relationship with Trump can secure endorsements over conservative ideologues in GOP primaries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to put the very best people on the field,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nWhat has helped McCarthy\u2019s standing is the lack of caucus infighting. Four years ago, members of the Freedom Caucus blocked his path to speaker, but on Thursday, the retreat kicked off with McCarthy shoulder to shoulder with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the founder of the rabble-rousing caucus.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s standing next to me now instead of shooting at me,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nOnce they lost the majority last fall, McCarthy sought out his rival to try settle old feuds, at least temporarily. McCarthy pushed him to take the ranking Republican position on the House Oversight Committee.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn,\u201d he told Jordan, who accepted.\n\nThe ultimate test comes November 2020, and McCarthy has placed his bet on Trump, hoping he draws out voters who will also pull the lever for his House candidates. He knows that a Trump victory and House GOP gains will likely keep him in power.\n\nHe is also very aware that a Trump defeat and House losses will imperil his future.\n\n\u201cI just believe, whatever job I\u2019m given,\u201d McCarthy said, \u201csurpass expectations and there will always be more opportunity for you.\u201d\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "In an interview with The Washington Post, the House minority leader sees Sen.
