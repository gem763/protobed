REUTERS/Daniel Munoz\n\nTop U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up their first day of trade talks on Thursday, with U.S. President Donald Trump welcoming what he called a \u201cvery, very good negotiation with China\u201d.\n\nBusiness groups expressed optimism the two sides might be able to de-escalate their trade war, which has sapped economic growth around the globe.\n\nA Chinese newspaper said on Friday that a \u201cpartial\u201d trade deal would benefit China and the United States, reflecting Beijing\u2019s aim of cooling the row before more U.S. tariffs kick in.\n\n\u201cMarkets are increasingly narrowly driven, this means that every piece of good news is going to propel markets strongly higher. Currently investors are very optimistic about the U.S.\u2013China trade negotiations as well potential Brexit resolution,\u201d said Marija Veitmane, multi-asset strategist at State Street.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are yet to see concrete details on either deal. We expect markets to sell off sharply should those hopes be disappointed,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Australian dollar was up 0.5% at 0.6796 per U.S. dollar AUD=D3 after rising to a two-week high of 0.6804 overnight.\n\nThe yuan was also higher at 7.0938 against the greenback after hitting a three-week high in the Asian trading session of 7.0890 CNH=EBS.\n\nThe safe-haven yen JPY=EBS on the other hand slipped to 108.28 per dollar, its weakest since Oct. 1, as investors' risk appetite improved.\n\nThe Swedish crown, which has been beaten up by the prospects of dismal global economic growth as result of trade tensions, got pushed up to a four-day high of 10.8065 against the euro EURSEK=D3, though its long-term weak trend remains unbroken for now.\n\nThe euro edged up 0.3% to $1.1033 EUR=EBS, mirroring the three-week high it reached on Thursday against the dollar, which usually appreciates as a safe-haven currency when trade relationships worsen.\n\nSterling surged to a three-month high of $1.2589 GBP=D3 and a five-month high of 87.65 pence against the euro EURGBP=D3 on the back of \"constructive\" talks in Brussels between British and European Union Brexit negotiators.\n\n\u201cGood news is always welcome, but at this stage it remains just that: news,\u201d said Dean Turner, an economist at UBS Wealth Management.\n\n\u201cThe chances of a deal seem to have improved and the pound has moved accordingly but hurdles still remain. Time to thrash out the details of the deal is tight, and then there is the question of parliamentary approval,\u201d Turner said.", "description": "The Australian dollar and Chinese yuan, often seen as barometers of investor risk appetite, rose Friday on hopes of progress in U.S.-China trade talks, while optimistic comments about the prospects of a possible Brexit divorce deal boosted sterling.", "authors": ["Olga Cotaga", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439670923&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A13U", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
