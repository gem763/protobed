The courage of these leaders and of our newly elected Frontliners should be an inspiration to all of us. We cannot let them down.\u201d\n\nAs far as fundraising solicitations go, the DCCC mailer is not particularly provocative. Indeed, dozens of congressional Democrats have sent similar fundraising appeals based on the impeachment inquiry since Speaker Nancy Pelosi made it official on Sept. 24.\n\nBut in trying to gin up donations off of the impeachment proceedings, the campaign committee has taken a notable gamble. The frontline members in the party are precisely the ones most publicly skittish about pursuing Trump\u2019s impeachment\u2014arguing, often, that it is a solemn responsibility or even a grave step that is fraught with political risk. That message could be complicated by the fact that the House Democratic campaign arm is now raising money explicitly for them and explicitly off of impeachment.\n\n\"The survival of our democracy may literally depend on what we do here,\u201d the fundraising solicitation reads. \u201cPlease rush your contribution to the DCCC today.\"\n\nThe DCCC\u2019s plea, sent directly to potential donors inside a letter that announces \u201cACTION NEEDED,\u201d reflects a notable shift in how party leadership has approached impeachment. For months, Pelosi and DCCC Chair Cheri Bustos (D-IL) let it be known that they thought pursuit of impeachment was a massive political risk for the party, specifically endangering the gains that Democrats had made with more moderate voters.\n\nBut polls have shifted in the Democrats\u2019 favor since the impeachment inquiry began. And even DCCC data has suggested that the issue is now a toss-up among the public.\n\nWhether that data is the same in swing districts is not entirely clear. But what\u2019s notable is that of the many Democrats who have sent impeachment-based fundraising appeals since the inquiry began, several were Frontliners who did not favor impeachment until the anonymous whistleblower\u2019s account of Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukranian president became public.\n\nRep. Colin Allred\u2014a Texas Democrat and impeachment holdout who flipped a longtime GOP seat in 2018\u2014sent a fundraising email on Sept. 30: \u201cThe President of the United States may think he is above the law -- but Colin Allred is holding him accountable!\u201d\n\nOthers have leaned on attacks from the DCCC\u2019s rival, the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cThe NRCC is attacking Mikie for calling on Congress to use all of the tools at its disposal -- including impeachment hearings -- to determine whether President Trump pressured Ukraine to interfere in our elections,\u201d said a Sept. 25 fundraising appeal from Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.), another district-flipping freshman.\n\nDemocratic fundraising professionals say that the impeachment push\u2014and the Trump conduct at the heart of it\u2014have inspired the party base in a rare way.\n\nAccording to Greg Berlin, founder and partner at Mothership Strategies, a Democratic digital fundraising firm, the first weeks of the impeachment inquiry and the Ukraine story have been one of the most significant non-electoral fundraising and activism moments among Democrats since the president fired former FBI Director James Comey in 2017.\n\n\u201cThis was so brazen, so out in the open, so obvious, that it really allowed the donors and activists to grab onto it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen something with this kind of staying power in a very, very long time.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Pelosi\u2019s impeachment announcement\u2014which came at the end of the third fundraising quarter of 2019\u2014helped to fuel a strong fundraising quarter for the DCCC. It raised $27.4 million in Q3\u2014with nearly half of that total coming in the month of September\u2014which the committee says is its strongest third quarter ever in a non-election year. House Democrats head into the final months of 2019 with three times more cash on hand\u2014$36 million\u2014than their GOP counterpart.", "description": "The party is now explicitly raising funds off of impeachment for its most vulnerable members, the very ones most skittish about impeachment.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Sam Stein", "Congressional Reporter", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571761705/191022-Brodey-tease_eshplx", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
