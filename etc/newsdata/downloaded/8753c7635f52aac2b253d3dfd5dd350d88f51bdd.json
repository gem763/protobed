While offering talks, North Korea still warned its dealings with the U.S. may end if Washington fails to come to the negotiating table without new acceptable proposals.\n\nSome experts said North Korea aims to wrest concessions from the United States once their diplomacy resumes.\n\nThe North\u2019s Korean Central News Agency said Kim, accompanied by top military and ruling Workers\u2019 Party officials, supervised the two rounds of test-firings at an unidentified place on Tuesday.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The first test of the weapon occurred on Aug. 24.\n\nTuesday\u2019s test fulfilled its purpose and allowed authorities to decide \u201cthe next-stage orientation to complete the weapon system,\u201d KCNA said. It quoted Kim as saying what remains to be done is \u201crunning fire test.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s weapons test was the eighth round of launches by North Korea since late July. Other weapons tested include at least three other newly developed short-range missile and rocket artillery systems that experts say would potentially expand its capabilities to strike targets throughout South Korea. South Korea\u2019s military said the two North Korean projectiles fired Tuesday flew about 330 kilometers (205 miles) in the direction of the waters off the North\u2019s east coast.\n\nU.S.-led diplomacy aimed at stripping North Korea of nuclear weapons collapsed after the second summit between Kim and President Donald Trump in Vietnam in February ended without any agreement due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on the North. Kim and Trump met again at a Korean border village in late June and agreed to resume talks.\n\nThe North Korean weapons tested in the past weeks were all short-range, and the country is still keeping its promise not to carry out nuclear and long-range missile tests. This suggests North Korea is trying to maintain the momentum for dialogue with the United States, experts say.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "North Korea said Kim Jong Un observed the test-launch of a super-large multiple rocket launcher, the latest in a series of weapons tests", "authors": ["Hyung-Jin Kim"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/north_korea_second_launch_test.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C0px%2C2113px%2C1106px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
