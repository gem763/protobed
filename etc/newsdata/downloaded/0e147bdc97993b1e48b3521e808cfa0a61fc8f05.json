Absolutely disgusting.\"\n\nThe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said the machine \"causes unnecessary harm to the animals and it also encourages people to see animals as nothing more than objects to play with\".\n\n\"Crabs are living creatures, not toys,\" it added.\n\nHouse of Seafood chief executive Francis Ng told AFP the promotion, which began this month, had been suspended after the outcry -- but added he was surprised at the reaction.\n\n\"People think I torture them but we don't have any intention of doing that,\" he said. \"The crabs are not being hurt.\"\n\nThe machine's claw is covered with plastic and the area inside is cushioned to prevent the creatures being injured if dropped, he said.\n\nNg said a similar promotion at two restaurants he operates in China was a success. He plans to meet with Singapore authorities and will cease using the machine permanently if ordered.\n\nRestaurants across Asia often keep live seafood in tanks for diners to pick out for their meals.\n\nmba/sr/kaf", "description": "A Singapore restaurant Thursday suspended a bizarre promotional stunt where customers use an arcade-style machine with a mechanical claw to catch live crabs after it sparked uproar online.
