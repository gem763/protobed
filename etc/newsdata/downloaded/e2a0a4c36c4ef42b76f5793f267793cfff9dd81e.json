Some 150 years after the end of the Civil War, it\u2019s a culture that still exists on the margins in America today.\n\nThat subculture is the subject of an arresting series of photographs provided to Reuters by freelancer Johnny Milano.\n\nA tattoo on the knuckles of a Klansman reads \u201cLove\u201d as he participates with members of the Nordic Order Knights and the Rebel Brigade Knights, groups that both claim affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan, in a ceremony on a fellow member's property.\n\nA Confederate flag hangs from a barn where members of the Virgil Griffin White Knights prepare for a cross-burning ceremony. A Klan group plans to hold a pro-Confederate flag rally at South Carolina's capitol on July 18, where a statue of a former state governor who championed white supremacy was vandalised last month amid scrutiny of symbols associated with slavery. The Civil War-era flag and related monuments have become flashpoints after nine black men and women were gunned down at a historic church in Charleston, South Carolina. The suspected shooter, Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white man, had posed with a Confederate battle flag in photos posted on a website that displayed a racist manifesto attributed to him. South Carolina removed the Confederate battle flag from the state capitol grounds on July 10, relegating a divisive symbol of the South\u2019s pro-slavery legacy to a museum.\n\nMembers of the Rebel Brigade Knights and the Nordic Order Knights take part in a cross-burning ceremony. The Loyal White Knights chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, based in Pelham, North Carolina, said it will rally at the South Carolina State House on July 18. \"We\u2019re standing up for the Confederacy,\" James Spears, the chapter's \"great titan,\" said on June 30. He said speakers would address slavery, then the Klan will hold a cross-lighting, or cross-burning, ceremony on private property.\n\nMembers of the Adirondack Fraternity White Knights display their tattoos and salute during a cross and swastika lighting. The Ku Klux Klan, which had about 6 million members in the 1920s, now has some 2,000 to 3,000 members nationally in about 72 chapters, or klaverns, according to the Southern Poverty Law Centre, an organisation that monitors extremist groups. The Klan is known for its history of violence toward African-Americans.\n\n1 / 18 Slideshow After holding a public rally, members of the Nordic Order Knights and Rebel Brigade Knights gather to raise a cross.
