He then went on to groom children while doing voluntary work.\n\nHuckle was compiling a paedophile's manual at the time of his arrest.", "description": "The ex-photographer, who abused up to 200 Malaysian children, was attacked with a \"makeshift knife\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1290/production/_109225740_f3d50628-7790-48ba-8f98-9758006e3a4f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
