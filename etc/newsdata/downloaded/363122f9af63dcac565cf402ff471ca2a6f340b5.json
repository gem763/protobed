Additionally, a North Carolina attorney general is currently suing Juul \"to limit the company\u2019s sales and marketing in the state\". Juul \u201ccontrols roughly three-quarters of the U.S. retail market for e-cigarettes,\u201d per the AP.\n\nThe WSJ stated, \u201cJuul\u2019s first marketing campaign in 2015, called \u2018Vaporized,\u2019 pitched the brand as a cool lifestyle accessory with images of people in their 20s and 30s, which critics say made the brand attractive to teens.\u201d Eventually, this campaign appeared to pay off with big results for the industry as well as for Juul, as \u201cvaping among teens jumped 78% from 2017 to 2018, federal data show\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Juul Labs spokesperson told FOX Business, without commenting on the FTC reports: \"Without commenting on any specific investigation, our paid influencer program, which was never formalized, was a small, short-lived pilot that ended in 2018. We worked with fewer than 10 adults on Juul-related content, and they were all smokers or former smokers over the age of 30. Juul spent less than $10,000 on influencers.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBeyond that, the Juul spokesperson added: \"Without commenting on any specific investigation, we fully cooperate and are transparent with any government agency or regulator who have interest in our category. We have never marketed to youth. Our earliest marketing campaign in 2015 was intended for adults in the 25-34-year-old demographic and lasted for six months. If one views the sales and revenue data, there is no evidence that it drove use, youth or otherwise. Nonetheless, we regret that the campaign was executed in a way that was perceived as appealing to minors. To avoid any misconceptions, we changed our approach to advertising in a way that offers no room for misinterpretation about the mission of our company or our intended customers. Today, our marketing efforts exclusively feature adult smokers aged 35+ who offer their personal experiences about switching to Juul products \u2013 all conveyed in a style, tone and message that is a direct appeal to current adult smokers. We have exited social media entirely and request that social media platforms delete inappropriate third party posts and listings. We have no higher priority than to prevent youth usage of our products. Our product is intended for current adult smokers and our marketing specifically is designed to help achieve that goal.\"\n\nIt has been a challenging week for Juul, CEO Kevin Burns appeared on CBS to address claims that his vaping products are linked to lung illness. He said the company is cooperating and is in \"close contact\" with the CDC as they examine the issue.", "description": "It has been a challenging week for Juul.", "authors": ["Christian De La Chapelle"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/Juul.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
