The president had begun the meeting talking about his \"nasty\" letter to Erdogan, according to a Democrat who was granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nSenate minority leader Chuck Schumer started to read the president a quote from his own former defence secretary James Mattis on the need to keep US troops in Syria to prevent a resurgence of Isis fighters.\n\n\n\nBut Trump cut Schumer off, complaining that Mattis was \"the world's most overrated general. You know why? He wasn't tough enough.\" Trump reportedly went on, \"I captured Isis.\"\n\n\n\nPelosi explained to Trump that Russia has always wanted a \"foothold in the Middle East,\" and now it has one with the US withdrawal. \"All roads with you lead to Putin,\" the speaker said. Trump reportedly countered: \"I hate Isis more than you do.\" Pelosi responded: \"You don't know that.\"\n\nSchumer intervened at one point and said, \"Is your plan to rely on the Syrians and the Turks?\" To which Trump answered: \"Our plan is to keep the American people safe.\" \"That's not a plan. That's a goal,\" Pelosi argued, prompting called her \"a third-rate politician\". At this point House majority leader Steny Hoyer interjected, saying: \"This is not useful.\"\n\n\n\nPelosi and Hoyer stood up and left the meeting. As they did, Trump said, \"Goodbye, we'll see you at the polls.\"\n\n\n\nAfterwards, the speaker told the press it was Trump who had had the \"meltdown\" and added: \"We have to pray for his health\".\n\nChris Riotta has more.", "description": "Donald Trump is being ridiculed online following the release of a letter he wrote to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan imploring him not to attack the Kurdish fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in which he said: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy.
