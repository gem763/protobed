Download the Service NSW app 2. Register an account 3. Enter the details of the physical licence such as address, licence number and the number on the back 4. Use the digital licence\n\nThe digital license is available through the Service NSW app and can be used as a form of identification at pubs and clubs.\n\nHowever, the state government is warning people to keep carrying their plastic licence as some venues may need time before accepting it.\n\n'Ensure your phone screen isn't cracked and your phone is charged. Carry your plastic card if you plan to travel overseas or interstate and as a backup to your digital driver licence,' the Service NSW website warns.\n\n'It ... may take some time before all organisations will be ready to accept the digital app.'\n\nService NSW also warns that those using the digital license must only pick up their phone when a police officer asks for the driver's licence, as penalties apply for using a mobile phone illegally.\n\nNSW is the second Australian state to implement the move, after South Australia launched a similar app in 2017.", "description": "Physical driver's licences set to be SCRAPPED as digital permits on smartphones are rolled out", "authors": ["Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/18/04/14920090-0-image-a-12_1560829090947.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
