Thai authorities said some fell ill with Canine Distemper Virus or CDV. Many had difficulty breathing or eating, and died as a result.\n\nImage copyright WFFT Image caption Tiger Temple attracted thousands of tourists before it was closed to the public 2016\n\nSpeaking with Reuters news agency, temple caretaker Athithat Srimanee denied the accusations that the tigers died because of inbreeding. He said the government was playing a \"blame game\".\n\nEdwin Wiek, founder of the Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand (WFFT), told the BBC that the big cats were being kept in small, cramped cages, making it easy for disease to spread.\n\nHe added that Canine Distemper is curable with proper food and supplements, access to clean water, and enough space to move around. But a limited government budget made this impossible.\n\n\"To be very honest, who would be ready to take in so many tigers at once?\" said Mr Wiek. \"The authorities should have asked for help from outside, but instead insisted on doing all work themselves.\"\n\nA lucrative trade\n\nAnalysis by Jonathan Head, BBC South-East Asia correspondent\n\nThe deaths of so many tigers in two government facilities has refocused attention on the challenges of managing an ever-expanding population of captive tigers, not just in Thailand, but in neighbouring countries like Laos and China.\n\nDespite pledges by both Thailand and Laos to reduce the numbers of tigers held in captivity on so-called \"tiger farms\", the populations have continued to rise.\n\nThere are now around 2,000 captive tigers in Thailand. Many are held by private individuals, not state institutions.\n\nCaptive tigers are a lucrative business, popular in particular with Chinese tourists who now make up nearly one third of foreign visitors in Thailand.\n\nThey breed easily, and there is always a suspicion that some are diverted into the illegal trade in tiger parts, which then encourages the poaching of South East Asia's dwindling population of wild tigers.\n\nWildlife campaigners say state institutions in Thailand need better funding to start taking custody of these privately owned tigers, and the tiger industry should be regulated more strictly.\n\nWhat is the Tiger Temple?\n\nThe attraction, run by Buddhist monks, was located in Thailand's Kanchanaburi Province, west of Bangkok.\n\nAt its height, visitors were charged 600 Thai Baht ($16, \u00a311) for entry, with additional costs to pet, feed, or take pictures with the tigers.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The bodies of 40 tiger cubs were found in a freezer in the temple's kitchen\n\nA National Geographic report alleged that the monks were operating a for-profit breeding business.\n\nThe WFFT also alleged there was evidence that wildlife trafficking took place, but has not provided specific examples.\n\nIn December 2014, authorities were alerted after three adult male tigers vanished from the temple. They had been micro-chipped, a legal requirement for captive endangered animals in Thailand, which allows them to be tracked.\n\nThe temple's veterinarian Somchai Visasmongkolchai later came forward after resigning from his post and said the microchips had been cut out of the three males.\n\nWhen police raided the site in 2016, 40 dead tiger cubs were found in the temple's kitchen freezer, along with other animal body parts.", "description": "Thai authorities said the big cats died of a virus, or from genetic problems linked to inbreeding.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nhb1n.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
