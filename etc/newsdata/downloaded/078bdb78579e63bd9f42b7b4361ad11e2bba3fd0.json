I meant all the left people,\u201d she said to kick off the \u201cIngraham Angle\u201d segment.\n\n\u201cOkay, you ready? Are you really prepared for this?\u201d she asked her viewers as an alarm blared and the camera pulled back to reveal what she called \u201cthe ultimate trigger sculpture.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has everything the Democrats hate,\u201d she said, advertising the art project. \u201cIf I could have put an SUV on this, I would have.\u201d\n\nAs the hunk of impaled beef sat before her, it occurred to Ingraham that straws don\u2019t tend to work when used to consume solid objects.\n\n\u201cCan you sip a steak?\u201d she wondered aloud.\n\nNonetheless, she tried.\n\n\u201cMmm. Tastes good, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the vapors of the steak.\u201d\n\nGiving a chuckle, Ingraham noted, \u201cThese are the light bulbs that Andrew Yang said are so dangerous to the planet because they burn out too often.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Laura Ingraham Drinks Steak Impaled With Lightbulbs and Plastic Straws to Own the Libs https://t.co/VVIU3tNR4e pic.twitter.com/uxN4BbqLtI \u2014 Tommy X-TrumpIsARacist-opher (@tommyxtopher) September 7, 2019\n\nIngraham appears to have been referencing Yang\u2019s performance at a climate town hall discussion with Democratic presidential candidates on Wednesday, where moderator Wolf Blitzer raised the Trump administration\u2019s rollback on requirements for more energy-saving lightbulbs.\n\nCriticizing the move, Yang warned that incandescent bulbs \u201cintentionally burn out\u201d and are not environmentally friendly. As a solution, he advocated for the use of bulbs that \u201cconsume less energy and need to be replaced less often.\u201d\n\nHowever, Yang\u2019s position is neither as new nor as radical as Ingraham\u2019s theatrics imply.\n\nIn fact, the phasing out of energy-inefficient bulbs has seen bipartisan support, and was included in a 2007 law signed by President George W. Bush to limit halogen and incandescent bulbs. A regulation derived from that law and signed by President Barack Obama aimed to place tighter energy efficiency standards on a wider range of bulbs, and would have taken effect in January. However, the current administration has announced it will repeal it.\n\nMeanwhile plastic straws and beef were also topics of the town hall, as Democrats have advocated for paper straws and cutbacks on the consumption of red meat, which contributes to the production of greenhouse gasses.", "description": "The Fox News host tried to use a plastic straw to drink the steak.
