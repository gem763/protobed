The director\u2019s past Oscar-nominated projects include Union Maids, which was an oral history of women\u2019s efforts to organize in the 1930s, and Seeing Red, which traced the development of the American Communist Party. In these films, as in American Factory, Reichert presents her subjects with remote bluntness; this is not a polemic, but rather an attempt to understand every side of an unhappy situation.\n\nThe first third of the film focuses mostly on the culture clash, with charming scenes of the American and Chinese workers getting to know one another, and fascinatingly candid footage of Cao Dewang, the chairman of Fuyao, touring the reopened factory. Cao\u2019s avuncular personality belies a serious tendency to micromanage, and Bognar and Reichert\u2019s camera follows him as he walks around pointing out architectural details he wants changed, to the American middle managers\u2019 dismay. This expectation of total control is presented as something Cao has taken for granted in China; Fuyao has clearly never had to deal with worker pushback before.\n\nThat vision of control is a bit of a fantasy in the U.S., however. For one thing, the former GM employees are making half what they made at the auto plant; more importantly, the glass-making conditions are often strenuous, and the facilities dangerously hot. The workers\u2019 organizing seems inevitable to everyone but Cao and his team of executives, who immediately authorize a campaign to disrupt it. The unionization effort becomes a narrative spine for American Factory, as Bognar and Reichert look in on management meetings, rallies, and the aggressive anti-union rhetoric employees are subjected to in the weeks leading up to the vote.\n\nStill, this is not explicitly a film about the struggles that unions face when organizing 21st-century workplaces. Throughout the movie, even as tensions run high, the filmmakers continue to show idiosyncratic little moments of friendship between Dayton natives and the Fujianese immigrants toiling alongside them. Just as the directors dig into the hardships created by the new factory\u2019s lower salaries, they also reckon with the loneliness of the Chinese workers who have moved thousands of miles from home and won\u2019t see their families again for years.\n\nAmerican Factory could have been made instead as a piece of Michael Moore\u2013style agitprop about the new forms of global capitalism that working-class Americans have to reckon with. Alternately, some scenes could be adapted into a light comedy about midwestern workers who learn about karaoke from their Chinese counterparts, and then enthusiastically teach them how to fly-fish. But this film reaches beyond those categories. The documentary\u2019s wider sweep benefits the viewer, demonstrating the complexity of the economic and social issues converging at the plant. Fuyao\u2019s presence in Ohio is an undeniable boon, an investment in an area where people felt abandoned by U.S. businesses, but Bognar and Reichert\u2019s film is a reminder that capitalism is always double-edged.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
