TikTok has ranked among the world\u2019s most-downloaded apps for the last 18 months, according to data provided by the research firm Sensor Tower. U.S. viewers have spent more than $37 million over the last two years on virtual coins for their favorite creators, TikTok\u2019s primary way of making money.\n\nBut researchers have grown worried that the app could also prove to be one of China\u2019s most effective weapons in the global information war, bringing Chinese-style censorship to mainstream U.S. audiences and shaping how they understand real-world events. Compounding researchers\u2019 concerns are TikTok\u2019s limited public comments about the content it removes and its purported independence from censors in Beijing.\n\nTikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance said in a statement that U.S. user data is stored domestically and that the app\u2019s content and moderation policies in the U.S. are led by a U.S.-based team not influenced by the Chinese government. ByteDance repeatedly declined to make executives available for on-the-record interviews.\n\nIn its statement, the company defended TikTok as a place for entertainment, not politics, and said its audience gravitates there for positive and joyful content as a possible explanation for why so few videos relate to sensitive topics such as the protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe company declined to provide details of how the app is policed in the U.S. or how the U.S. team shields itself from being influenced by authorities in Beijing, where ByteDance is headquartered. Officials in the Chinese embassy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTikTok\u2019s surging popularity spotlights the tension between the Web\u2019s global powers: the United States, where free speech and competing ideologies are held as (sometimes messy) societal bedrocks, and China, where political criticism is forbidden as troublemaking.\n\nTikTok\u2019s Chinese counterpart, researchers say, remains captive to the ruling regime\u2019s ideas of appropriate content and censorship, and they point to the way the nation\u2019s Communist Party has used it as a propaganda vessel for young audiences that might otherwise not seek out state-media news.\n\n[Under Hong Kong\u2019s streets, the subway becomes a battleground for protesters and police]\n\nYaqiu Wang, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the Hong Kong protests marked one of the first big tests of how Chinese companies could project the government\u2019s dogmas to a global audience.\n\n\u201cThey are making the commercial media repost or reproduce what has been produced by state media. And they are forcing censorship to create a narrative in the sense that this is not what happened,\u201d Wang said. \u201cFor Chinese companies, the government has so much control. You have no choice. If it\u2019s politically sensitive, your company is in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nLong seen as a launchpad for viral memes, TikTok in the U.S. is entering a kind of social-media adolescence, expanding into a new public square for young viewers to learn about and riff off current events. Videos with the #trump2020 hashtag, for instance, have accrued more than 70 million views: One clip by user CountryGirl9352, in which she lip-syncs Trump\u2019s complaint about plastic straws, has received more than 500 comments and 10,000 likes.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know what videos are censored on TikTok: ByteDance\u2019s decisions about the content it surfaces or censors are largely opaque. The company provides no information about the videos it removes for violating its prohibitions against hate speech or extremism, and it does not offer the kinds of tools that would make the platform accessible to outside research. It\u2019s also possible that users in Hong Kong could be self-censoring by not posting politically fraught content onto an app closely scrutinized by Chinese censors.\n\n[The U.S. government fined the app now known as TikTok $5.7 million for illegally collecting children\u2019s data]\n\nBut popular hashtags used by Hong Kong protester that have spread widely across other social media barely exist on TikTok.\n\nThe #antielab hashtag, a central organizing post named for protesters\u2019 resistance to an extradition bill seen as weakening Hong Kong sovereignty, has more than 34,000 posts on Instagram but only 11 posts on TikTok, totaling about 3,000 views. The hashtags for #HongKongProtests and #HongKongProtestors, some of the biggest rallying points on Twitter, return either a single video or an error message: \u201cCouldn\u2019t find this hashtag: Check out trending videos.\u201d The #HongKongProtest hashtag showed six videos, totaling about 5,000 views.\n\nSearches on the TikTok app in the U.S. using Chinese characters produce similar results. A main protest hashtag (\u53cd\u9001\u4e2d), used to refer to the anti-extradition movement, shows about 100 videos totaling roughly 105,000 views. For comparison, a hashtag for #snails on TikTok has more than 6.6 million views.\n\nTikTok\u2019s parent company has offered limited information about its mix of human and algorithmic censors, which scan videos and remove blacklisted words and images. The company\u2019s chief said last year it would employ 10,000 moderators to flag and remove content following a crackdown from Chinese regulators targeting the app\u2019s \u201cimproper content.\u201d\n\nThat lack of transparency, alongside the company\u2019s Chinese roots, appears to have become a point of satire for some TikTok users. The #TiananmenSquare hashtag \u2014 named for the sprawling Beijing center where military forces in 1989 killed thousands of people following pro-democracy protests, a massacre strictly censored across China \u2014 shows about 20 videos, most of which joked that the bloody episode never happened.\n\nOrganized online Chinese campaigns to disparage Hong Kong protesters, researchers said, also suggest that ByteDance could be used to influence global perceptions. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube last month said they had removed fake accounts, including some disguised as everyday Americans, that had praised the government and portrayed the protesters as terrorists and cockroaches.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re willing to do this on Twitter and Facebook, of course they\u2019re going to want to do it on their own platform,\u201d said Elliott Zaagman, a writer and co-host of a popular podcast on the Chinese tech industry.\n\n[In accusing China of disinformation, Twitter and Facebook take on a role they\u2019ve long rejected]\n\nDespite TikTok\u2019s growing popularity in the U.S., the app has barely registered in Washington\u2019s ruling circles. Many lawmakers perhaps first heard of the company when a Facebook executive pointed to its rise at a hearing this year as evidence that Facebook didn\u2019t hold a monopoly on people\u2019s attention spans online.\n\nIn February, the Federal Trade Commission fined the company $5.7 million over allegations it violated rules meant to protect kids\u2019 privacy online. FTC watchdogs said that the precursor to TikTok, the karaoke app Musical.ly, illegally collected names, email addresses, pictures and other data from children younger than 13.\n\nByteDance has since sought to introduce itself to regulators, registering its first lobbyist in June and hiring additional outside consultants a month later, federal ethics filings show.\n\nByteDance has been named the world\u2019s most valuable start-up thanks to massive investments from tech powerhouses such as Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group that have valued it at more than $75 billion. (Uber, for comparison, is worth less than $60 billion.)\n\nFounded in 2012, ByteDance now owns a stable of news, video and selfie apps, most of which are used almost exclusively in China. But in Silicon Valley, TikTok is regarded as having traced a uniquely enviable rise, becoming the first Chinese app to truly pierce the global Internet mainstream.\n\n[Chinese youth, fed \u2018officially sanctioned fake news,\u2019 vilify Hong Kong peers]\n\nTikTok closely resembles its Chinese counterpart, Douyin, which ByteDance makes available only to audiences in mainland China. The app has become one of the most popular conduits of news and entertainment in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, and it has been celebrated in state media as a homegrown success story well-suited to disseminate the government\u2019s ideology.\n\nState-endorsed propaganda is commonplace, said Zaagman, who compared it to the hidden medicine in a dog\u2019s food bowl: a heap of fun videos that make it easier to swallow a dash of nationalism.\n\nByteDance must comply with China\u2019s \u201cGreat Firewall,\u201d which blocks major news sources and censors what the party regards as objectionable facts and ideas. Social-media platforms in China are required by law to purge political dissent, and TikTok\u2019s Chinese counterpart has banned a broad range of supposedly subversive topics, including any content that causes \u201cdiscomfort.\u201d\n\nAmong the censored images, the state-run newspaper Global Times said last year, was the children\u2019s cartoon Peppa Pig, which it said had become associated with \u201cunruly slackers roaming around and the antithesis of the young generation the Party tries to cultivate.\u201d (ByteDance later rebutted that claim, and Peppa Pig lives on in TikTok streams in the U.S.)\n\nPatriotic messages have dominated Douyin in the weeks since the Hong Kong protests began: People\u2019s Daily, the party\u2019s official media outlet, posted a video last week of Hong Kong police taking a break after work, which received 1.1 million \u201clikes\u201d and about 40,000 comments.\n\n[Hong Kong leader fully withdraws extradition bill, but protesters say it\u2019s not enough]\n\nTikTok\u2019s owners have also routinely bent to government demands and intervention. ByteDance last year was forced to dismantle its popular comedy app Neihan Duanzi (roughly translated, \u201cimplied jokes\u201d) following a government purge, during which Chinese regulators said the app\u2019s \u201cvulgar and improper content\u201d had violated social morals and \u201ccaused strong disgust.\u201d\n\nByteDance founder Zhang Yiming, one of China\u2019s richest men, issued a public, self-effacing apology for content he called \u201cin deviation of socialist core values\u201d and pledged the company would work to ensure party \u201cvoices are broadcast to strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot post anything on Douyin that contravenes the official party line on anything and expect it to remain up for long,\u201d said Matt Schrader, a China analyst for the Washington advocacy group Alliance for Securing Democracy.\n\n\u201cThe imprisonment of more than a million Uighurs, the corruption of upper-level party members, the videos of Hong Kong protesters: none of it stays,\u201d he added. \u201cAnything that\u2019s a news source or a news app must be in line with the version of the world they want people to see.\"\n\nThat stance also carries into TikTok\u2019s other major markets. The company\u2019s head of operations in India, Raj Mishra, has said the platform would not prominently feature criticism of the country\u2019s leaders because, as he told Bloomberg earlier this year, the app is a place \u201cwhere people come to have fun rather than creating any political strife.\u201d\n\nTikTok today in the U.S. is an eye-catching playground of memes, music and other distractions, with thin connections to mainstream politics and no guarantee of future growth. But app experts believe it could grow into a formidable part of Americans\u2019 online information food chain \u2014 much in the same way that Facebook, founded as an app for college students, transformed the arenas of news, politics and misinformation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massively untapped platform that organizations can use to change the perceptions of a massive audience,\u201d said Rohan Midha, the managing director of PMYB, a U.K.-based marketing firm that helps coordinate corporate sponsorship deals with TikTok\u2019s growing corps of influencers. \u201cAnd most of the users are quite young, so you can reach a young demographic who it might be easier to shape their perceptions outright.\u201d\n\nTimothy McLaughlin in Hong Kong, Yuan Wang in Beijing and Craig Timberg in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "Social media has been a quintessentially American journey rooted in ideas about creative expression and freedom of speech.
