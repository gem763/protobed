He has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex.\n\nShe Said is published today (10 September).", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s vital role in launching the investigation into disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been revealed.", "authors": ["Ellie Harrison"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/07/08/gettyimages-1159850441.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
