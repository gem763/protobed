Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., ranking member of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, speaks during a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing with representatives from major tech companies on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nRep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., who has served in Congress for 40 years and is the second-most senior House member, announced Wednesday that he won\u2019t seek reelection, joining the more than a dozen Republicans heading for the exits.\n\nThe 76-year-old Wisconsin lawmaker becomes the highest ranking Republican to vacate a safe GOP seat. Donald Trump handily won his district by 20 points in 2016.\n\nSensenbrenner has been a mainstay on the House Judiciary Committee, where he served during President Clinton\u2019s impeachment in January 1999 and was one of 13 House impeachment managers who tried the case in the Senate.\n\nHe also served as the panel\u2019s chairman in the past decade and has headed the Science Committee.\n\n\u201cFor 40 years I have held over 100 town hall meetings each year; I have helped countless individuals when they have encountered difficulties with the federal government; I've taken 23,882 votes on the House Floor; been the lead sponsor or co-sponsor of 4299 pieces of legislation; ushered 768 of them through the House for passage, and watched as 217 of them have been signed into law by six different presidents,\u201d Sensenbrenner said in a statement. \u201cI think I am leaving this district, our Republican Party, and most important, our country, in a better place than when I began my service.\u201d\n\nSensenbrenner joined two of his colleagues in calling it quits on Wednesday alone, making him the 16th House Republican to announce he would not seek reelection in 2020. By contrast, only four Democrats have announced plans to voluntarily exit the chamber, which their party controls, with Rep. Susan A. Davis of Southern California adding her name to that list with an announcement Wednesday\n\nIn addition to Sensenbrenner, Rep. Bill Flores (Tex.), the former chair of the conservative Republican Study Committee, also announced plans to retire at the end of his term. The retired oil and gas executive who would also serve on the House Energy and Commerce Committee first won his seat by defeating a longtime Democratic incumbent. His Central Texas district has since also become reliably Republican.\n\nLast year, Flores prevailed with nearly 57 percent of the vote. But instead, Flores wants to spend more time with his family and resume private-sector business activities, he said in a statement. He became the fifth GOP lawmaker from Texas to retire.\n\n\u201cAfter much prayer over the past few days and following conversations with my wife, Gina, during that time, I have decided that my current term will be my last,\u201d Flores, 65, who was first elected in 2010, said in a statement.\n\n[Rep. Shimkus won\u2019t seek reelection, joins growing list of Republicans heading for the exit]\n\nSeveral of the Republican retirements have been in increasingly competitive districts; in three of them, GOP incumbents won reelection by fewer than five percentage points in 2018. But others are in safer districts, like Sensenbrenner\u2019s and Flores\u2019.\n\nDavis has represented her Southern California district since 2001. In a letter to her constituents, Davis did not say why she was leaving but expressed a desire to live and work in San Diego after 20 years of commuting cross-country. She wrote that she had \u201cstruggled to make this very difficult decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is tough for me. There are always compelling issues and challenges that have encouraged me to pursue each new election cycle,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cMost touching has been the appeals to stay on and go yet another round with the hope that I would always be your representative. It doesn\u2019t get any better than that!\u201d\n\nDavis\u2019s district is solidly Democratic \u2014 Hillary Clinton won it over Trump in 2016 by 35 points \u2014 so there is little risk to her party that her leaving would result in a Republican pickup.\n\nOther Democrats who have announced their retirements are Reps. Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano (N.Y.), David Loebsack (Iowa) and Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (N.M.), who is running for the Senate.\n\nSensenbrenner hails from a wealthy family and is a known as an avid lottery player. He\u2019s won at least three times.\n\nPaul Kane contributed to this report.", "description": "The Wisconsin lawmaker, 76, is the second-most senior House member and joins more than a dozen Republicans heading for the exits.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hSVJDHcXgWSfkbfbcPZCpyIbl5c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QJD7S3WPNUI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
