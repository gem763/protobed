However, it was just as certain to me that he would eventually do something to justify impeachment. And early appearances suggest he has.\n\nAt best, President Trump used his office to seek personal and political gain and engage in 2016 conspiracy peddling with a strategic ally engaged in a war with Russia. At worse, Trump held back military aid to Ukraine in order to extract this personal and political gain. It\u2019s a difference without a distinction when it comes to his fitness to serve.\n\nThe military assistance, authorized by the Congress, was unilaterally held back by Trump, with no coordination with the National Security Council or the Office of Management and Budget, according to the IG\u2019s report. Based on these revelations and what President Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani have publicly admitted, an impeachment investigation is warranted.", "description": "What President Trump did was wrong, in the best circumstances.
