InTouch obtained the video of Maddox tactfully answering two questions posed by a paparazzo.\n\nMaddox was asked whether Pitt would be visiting him at college. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, what\u2019s happening,\u201d he replied. The reporter then asked if his relationship with Pitt was over for good. \u201cWhatever happens, happens,\" Maddox replied. The focus of the questions shifted to Maddox's new life in South Korea. Maddox said he was living in dorms and made it pretty clear he's academically-focused right now.\n\nPhoto credit: Gisela Schober - Getty Images More\n\nUs Weekly reported at the end of August that Maddox doesn't want to be close to Pitt. (Pitt reportedly got into an altercation with Maddox on a private plane in 2016; it was that incident that led Jolie to file for divorce.)\n\nUs was told by a source that \u201cMaddox doesn\u2019t really see himself as Brad\u2019s son.\u201d A separate source described Maddox as having \"some simmering resentment\" toward Pitt, though attributed it partly to Maddox just being a teenager seeking independence. Maddox is said to be very close to his mother.\n\nPitt, Us was told by a source, hadn't lost hope on Maddox. \"Brad\u2019s hopeful that as his son gets older, they\u2019ll become close again,\" the source said.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "He was asked whether his and Brad Pitt's relationship was over for good, and he answered honestly.", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.pN3vNerxviSWohtDGUaag--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/ee37e4b3900764eee4e300a789214719"}
