If that\u2019s the case, then Apple\u2019s competitors have been doing the same thing for even longer when it comes to the camera. What might previously have been dismissed as gimmicks are now headline features for Apple.\n\nThe two biggest additions to the iPhone 11 camera system, the ultrawide lens and night mode, are commonplace on Android phones. That\u2019s not really relevant for most iPhone buyers, who just want a phone that runs iOS and will enjoy the new capabilities. But since it\u2019s impossible to know whether Apple has caught up to competitors in the area that matters most \u2014 basic image quality \u2014 the camera section of the presentation felt a little flat.\n\nDefensive additions rather than innovations\n\nApple was among the first companies to introduce a dual-camera system on a phone, and certainly one of the first to make it really useful. The iPhone 7 Plus\u2019 telephoto camera enabled portrait mode and greatly improved zoom image quality, the one area where phones still lag cheap point-and-shoot cameras. So it was a little surprising to see Apple ditch the telephoto camera in favor of the new ultrawide lens for the iPhone 11\u2019s dual-camera system.\n\nMake no mistake, ultrawide is a great feature, and Apple spent a lot of time explaining the dramatic creative possibilities it enables. Anyone upgrading to the iPhone 11 will have a lot of fun with it. But why now? LG deserves credit for pioneering ultrawide cameras on every one of its flagship phones since the G5 in early 2016, and now in 2019 pretty much every other mid-to-high-end Android phone has one. Apple is simply catching up here.\n\nThat\u2019s also true of the iPhone 11 Pro, which features a triple-camera system like every other flagship phone this year. Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller called it a \u201cpro camera system,\u201d though if the Pro is doing anything beyond the regular 11 other than keeping the telephoto around and improving the aperture to f/2.0, he didn\u2019t say. Schiller pointed out that between the ultrawide and telephoto cameras, the 11 Pro has a zoom range of 4x, which is true. But it still doesn\u2019t have any further reach than the XS, and it can\u2019t match phones like Oppo\u2019s Reno 10x Zoom, which (confusingly) has about 8x optical zoom range with its ultrawide and 5x telephoto lenses.\n\nNight mode, meanwhile, is a feature that exposed Apple\u2019s lack of competitiveness in low-light photography when Google brought it to Pixel phones a year ago, and the situation was compounded by Huawei\u2019s even more impressive take on the idea. In truth, the iPhone XS is worse than basically all of its competitors in low light even when they\u2019re not using a night mode, though the way the iPhone 11 automatically activates the feature should help a lot there. Again, though, it\u2019s a defensive addition rather than an innovation. Apple simply had to add a night mode this year to even remain in the conversation.\n\nAs far as basic image quality goes, Apple didn\u2019t have a lot to say. Last year the company made a big hardware leap by adding a physically larger main image sensor to the iPhone XS, so we were unlikely to see a similar change in the iPhone 11. The biggest difference with the main camera is that it now uses 100 percent focus pixels across the whole sensor, which should supposedly give three times faster autofocusing in low light. The selfie camera gets a more significant improvement, jumping from 7 to 12 megapixels and using a wider lens \u2014 though portrait selfies are zoomed and cropped to 7 megapixels by default.\n\nIt was notable that Apple kept claiming that the iPhone 11 can shoot the highest quality video on a smartphone, a claim that is entirely believable. The iPhone\u2019s video capabilities are already class-leading, and with improved extended dynamic range recording in the 11, there\u2019s no reason to expect anyone to catch up any time soon. Apple really can\u2019t say the same thing about still image quality, however, and that\u2019s where attention will fall when the new iPhones make their way into the world.\n\nWill Smart HDR get any better?\n\nAs ever, the new iPhones\u2019 image quality will be defined by the company\u2019s software stack and how it works with the image signal processor in the A13 Bionic processor. In other words, will Smart HDR get any better? Apple says it\u2019s tweaked the image pipeline, now including \u201csemantic rendering\u201d to obtain a better idea of the subject and how best to expose the photo, while \u201cnext-gen Smart HDR\u201d makes use of multi-scale tone mapping to handle highlights in specific parts of the image. There\u2019s also a new feature called Deep Fusion that Schiller described as \u201ccomputational photography mad science,\u201d but it won\u2019t be ready until later in the year.\n\nSmart HDR is a technically impressive feature that retains a lot of dynamic range and editing latitude in most photos, but it doesn\u2019t always produce the most pleasing images. Next to Google\u2019s Pixel phones, for example, iPhone XS photos often appear to lack punch and contrast. Unsurprisingly, Apple didn\u2019t get into a discussion of taste and subjective aesthetic consideration on stage, since that would have flown over the heads of most viewers who just want their camera to capture the scene properly. But we will have to see whether the company\u2019s approach to image tuning has changed with the iPhone 11.\n\nThat\u2019s really the story with Apple\u2019s camera presentation overall. The iPhone 11 Pro has achieved feature parity with its competitors, more or less, and people upgrading from within the iOS ecosystem will no doubt be happy with the ultrawide camera and night mode. From a broader perspective, however, we won\u2019t know whether Apple has returned to the days of iPhone camera supremacy until we have the new devices in hand.", "description": "The two biggest additions to the iPhone 11 camera system, the ultrawide lens and night mode, are commonplace on Android phones.
