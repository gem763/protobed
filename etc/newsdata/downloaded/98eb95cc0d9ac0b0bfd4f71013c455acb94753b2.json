No.\u201d\n\nJohn Setka warns Labor he plans to appeal court decision to allow expulsion Read more\n\nPatrick said they were likely to take a \u201ccombination\u201d of actions including referring the matter to the privileges committee, referring Setka to the police, or inviting him to explain his comments to the Senate education and employment committee.\n\n\u201cThere should be zero tolerance of anyone who seeks to influence a senator\u2019s vote by way of threats, we can\u2019t possibly leave this unattended.\u201d\n\nLambie told the Senate that \u201cto seek to influence a vote in this chamber by threat or intimidation is completely inappropriate\u201d.\n\n\u201cI dish it out a fair bit so I can\u2019t complain when it comes back in my direction but these comments are entirely beyond the pale,\u201d she said. \u201cPolitics can be brutal but it should never become violent.\u201d\n\nLambie said she would not be swayed by threats and \u201callowing [the comments] to go unanswered is no longer an option\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo John: I can only appeal to whatever is left of your sense of decency and honour, and ask you to do what is plainly in the interests of your members and I will urge you once again to stand down and resign.\u201d\n\nA Construction Forestry Mining Maritime and Energy Union (CFMMEU) source rejected the claim Setka had sought to intimidate the senators, arguing there was \u201ctalk of running political campaigns (like happens at every election) but no physical threats or anything of that nature were ever made\u201d.\n\nCentre Alliance and Lambie are the casting votes on the Coalition\u2019s ensuring integrity bill, ostensibly targeted at the CFMMEU and Setka but likely to have wide-ranging impacts on all unions.\n\nLambie has suggested she will support the bill unless Setka quits while Centre Alliance is still pursuing further changes to lessen its potential to punish minor breaches of industrial law and prevent its misuse by employers seeking to improve their bargaining position.\n\nThe Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has vowed to expel Setka from Labor for his convictions for breaching a family violence intervention order and harassment, and allegations that he made comments denigrating the work of the anti-violence campaigner Rosie Batty. Setka denies making the comments about Batty.\n\nSetka has been suspended from Labor \u2013 but has not been expelled because the party is awaiting a further legal appeal \u2013 and still holds his union position despite pressure from the Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, and others to resign.\n\nOn Sunday Albanese said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for John Setka to realise that he is doing damage to the movement. And if he has any loyalty to the movement, he will act appropriately.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another occasion in which John Setka has used language and behaviour that is unacceptable for anyone participating in civil society.\n\n\u201cJohn Setka\u2019s actions undermine the hard work [of] shop stewards, union delegates, organisers and union officials who work very hard, most of them as volunteers \u2026 to advance the interests of the trade union movement as an important component of a democratic society.\u201d", "description": "The Senate crossbenchers say they may refer the controversial unionist to the police", "authors": ["Paul Karp"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a34f81719bcfe5bd3668d23774ddfd7e71b9c250/0_1_4611_2767/master/4611.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb807269ece16a8aec9373164b51a779", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
