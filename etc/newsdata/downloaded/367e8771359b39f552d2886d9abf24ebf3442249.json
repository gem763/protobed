However, these titles will become personal and, therefore, any future spouses or children will not have a right to them.\n\nMadeleine, 37, shares three children with her husband, O\u2019Neill, 45, a British-American financier: Princess Leonore, 5, Prince Nicolas, 4, and Princess Adrienne, 1.\n\nMadeleine\u2019s brother, 40, shares two children with former model and reality TV star Sofia, 34: Prince Alexander, 2, and Prince Gabriel, 2.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE USING AFRICA TOUR TO REPAIR 'TARNISHED' REPUTATION: REPORT\n\nMadeleine took to Instagram on Monday to also confirm the news.\n\n\u201cEarlier today, the court announced that Leonore, Nicolas and Adrienne will no longer belong to the royal house,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis change has been planned for a long time. Chris and I think it\u2019s good that our children are now getting a greater opportunity to shape their own lives as private individuals in the future.\u201d\n\nPhilip also released a similar post on Instagram.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE SUES BRITISH TABLOID, PRINCE HARRY SPEAKS OUT: 'MY DEEPEST FEAR IS HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF'\n\n\u201cWe see this as a positive as Alexander and Gabriel will have freer choices in life,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey will retain their Duke titles\u2026 which we value and are proud of\u2026 We will continue to focus on issues close to our hearts. We will also continue to support the King and the Crown Princess \u2014 our future head of state \u2014 and participate in the King's activities.\"\n\nPeople magazine reported on Monday that the decision does not affect the children of Crown Princess Victoria, who is heir to the throne. The 42-year-old shares two children with her husband Prince Daniel, 46: Princess Estelle, 7, and Prince Oscar, 3. Unlike their cousins, Estelle and Oscar will continue to be official members of the royal house.\n\nGustaf's move echoes Harry's and Markle\u2019s decision not to give their son Archie an official royal title, which will grant him more privacy. A royal source told the outlet that while there are courtesy titles the British royals could apply to the baby, the couple has chosen not to do so at this time.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE REVEALS HER NICKNAME FOR SON ARCHIE\n\nHarry, 35, and Markle, 38, were given the title of Duke and Duchess on their wedding day in May 2018. The magazine shared it is a tradition for the eldest son of a duke to eventually inherit his father\u2019s title. Archie could ultimately be given the secondary Sussex title before inheriting the dukedom.\n\nArchie\u2019s cousin, Prince George, was named His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge upon his birth in 2013. His siblings Charlotte and Louis were given the titles Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge and His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.\n\nBack in August 2018, a rep for the Swedish royal family confirmed to Fox News that Madeleine was moving to Florida with her family that fall.\n\nMadeleine, who\u2019s seventh in line to the Swedish throne, is no stranger to America. People magazine reported the family already had a summer home in Florida.\n\nPRINCE HARRY ADMITS HE'S SO 'OVERWHELMED' OVER WORLD'S ISSUES THAT HE STRUGGLES TO GET OUT OF BED: REPORTS\n\nWhile still single, in 2010, Madeleine moved to New York City and began working as a project manager for her mother Queen Silvia\u2019s World Childhood Foundation.\n\nAfter they tied the knot in 2013, Madeleine and O\u2019Neill remained in the Big Apple and their firstborn was born at a private hospital stateside in 2014.\n\nThe family then moved to London, yet Madeleine returned to Sweden to give birth to the couple\u2019s third child in 2018.\n\nTo retain her royal title, Madeleine has not taken on her husband\u2019s surname. And O\u2019Neill, who preferred to retain his U.K. and U.S. citizenship, has no royal titles and is not an official member of the Swedish royal family.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE ENDS MATERNITY LEAVE TO PROMOTE NEW CHARITY FASHION LINE\n\nBack in 2016, Madeleine told People magazine she\u2019s just like any other parent on the go.\n\n\u201c[I\u2019m] pretty much like a normal mom,\u201d she explained. \u201c[My children] wake me up and we fix breakfast together and the breakfast flies all over the place! And then we go out to the park and we swing, we try to do a lot of activities because my little Leonore, she has lots of energy, so we have to keep her stimulated and busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think because my mom and father, of course, were so devoted to their work and as king and queen, they have lots of obligations, so they were away quite a bit when we were small. But when they were home, they were very present and I feel that I want to give my children as much as I can.\u201d", "description": "The Swedish royal family is following in the footsteps of Prince Harry and Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-547383346.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
