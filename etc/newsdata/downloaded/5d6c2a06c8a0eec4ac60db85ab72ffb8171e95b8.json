There\u2019s a lot of speculation going about the Cryptoverse as to what\u2019s behind this push, whether it\u2019s Tron Foundation's many daily updates, or perhaps John McAfee's latest promise.\n\nAt 10:15 UTC, the 11th coin by market capitalization trades at 0.016 USD. It\u2019s up by 3% in the past 24 hours. The charts show the price gradually rising since September 26th when it was USD 0.012, and then picking up speed on September 30th. A smaller spike has been recorded on October 8th, and many are wondering what might be a contributing factor \u2013 or even a cause \u2013 for Tron\u2019s latest rally.\n\nTRX price chart:\n\nThere\u2019s generally a green wave at the moment covering the crypto market, despite the likely hurdles in its way, with the absolute majority of top 20 coins being in green today.\n\nOnly eight days ago, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced their support for TRX staking, starting with October 1st. Furthermore, Tron Foundation and Tron\u2019s founder, Justin Sun, are prolific tweeters, coming out with updates or announcements several times a day, which include giveaways, and most recently BTFS Daemon installation and configuration guide, while they also post weekly reports on their Medium page. The latest report says, in Sun\u2019s words, that Tron \u201chas added another 500,000 users on the mainnet in Q3 - with a total amount of over 3.7 million mainnet addresses.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of BTFS, just recently, on October 1st, Sun and Tron Foundation announced the BittTorrent File System (BTFS) mainnet launch, which promises to bring cheaper transactions and greater decentralization into the blockchain world. While the testnet was available for the Tron blockchain only, the Foundation also announced the integration of the BTT token with the BTFS network in late 2019.\n\nAll this, or none of it, could\u2019ve had an influence on the price rising in the past week. However, another twist in this story might\u2019ve had something to do with this jump. In theory, at least. After teasing people on Twitter, famous crypto advocate and IT security entrepreneur, John McAfee, launched his non-custodial exchange, McAfeedex.com on October 7th, for which he claims was the victim of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks already. Though the beta version supports coins on the Ethereum blockchain only, \u201cadditional blockchains will be added to the full release,\u201d said its founder. In fact, just a day before, McAfee seems to have confirmed that his exchange will be launched on Tron as well.", "description": "Tron blockchain project saw its native coin, TRX, jump 12% in the last seven days.
