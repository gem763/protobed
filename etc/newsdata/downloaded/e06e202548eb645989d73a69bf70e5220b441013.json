We can tell from our first chart that GM has boosted the number of dealerships it runs in the third quarter.\n\nNext up is a map of GM's US presence mapped. You can zoom in on the map, and watch development pver to,e by clicking the 'Play' symbol in the lower-left-hand corner on the slidebar. A separate FT piece, which highlighted Einhorn's fund as a September winner, notes that he has also taken a position in aircraft leasing firm AerCap Holdings NV (NYSE: ) when he spoke at the annual Sohn Investment event in midtown Manhattan.\n\nGeneral Motors - Certified Dealerships Map\n\nPart of Einhorn's successful trading strategy in 2019 required he take on some gutsy calls against market darlings, according to the Bloomberg report - including Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: ). And, in September, Einhorn was right on both. His call of Amazon's top was foreshadowed in - below - and hiring began to dip, right before the stock did - which is in our next chart.\n\nAmazon Job Listings vs Share Price\n\nIn fact - as October sets in - it seems that the only poor decision Einhorn has made, lately, is that he just can't hop off the New York Mets' bandwagon.\n\nAbout the Data:\n\nThinknum tracks companies using information they post online - jobs, social and web traffic, product sales and app ratings - and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Thinknum covering: General Motors Company, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc, AerCap Holdings NV.
