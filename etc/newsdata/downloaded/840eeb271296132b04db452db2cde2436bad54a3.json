There were two people killed inside\" the car, he said.\n\nFrom the outskirts of Barisha, an inhabitant of a camp for the displaced also heard helicopters followed by what he described as US-led coalition air strikes.\n\nThey \"were flying very low, causing great panic among the people\", Ahmed Hassawi told AFP by phone.\n\nAnother resident, who gave his name as Abu Ahmad and lives less than 100m away from the site of the destroyed house, said he heard voices \"speaking a foreign language\" during the raid.\n\nThe AFP correspondent said the area of the night-time operation had been cordoned off by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group dominated by members of Syria's former Al-Qaeda affiliate controlling Idlib.\n\nBetween the trees, bulldozers could be seen at the site, clearing out the rubble.\n\n'Joint intelligence'\n\nTurkey, which has been waging an offensive against the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeast Syria in recent weeks, had \"advance knowledge\" about the raid, a senior Turkish official said.\n\n\"To the best of my knowledge, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi arrived at this location 48 hours prior to the raid,\" the official told AFP.\n\nThe commander-in-chief of the SDF, who have been fighting IS in Syria, said the operation came after \"joint intelligence work\" with American forces.\n\nTrump also said that Iraq had been \"very good\" over the raid.\n\nHe said no US soldiers were wounded, despite \"doing a lot of shooting\" and \"a lot of blasting\". The only US casualty was a military dog in the tunnel with the trapped Islamic State leader.\n\nLong pursued by the US-led coalition against IS, Baghdadi has been erroneously reported dead several times in recent years.\n\nBaghdadi - an Iraqi native believed to be around 48 years old - was rarely seen.\n\nAfter 2014 he disappeared from sight, only surfacing in a video in April with a wiry grey and red beard and an assault rifle at his side, as he encouraged followers to \"take revenge\" after the group's territorial defeat.\n\nHis reappearance was seen as a reassertion of his leadership of a group that - despite its March defeat - has spread from the Middle East to Asia and Africa and claimed several deadly attacks in Europe.\n\nThe US State Department had posted a $25m reward for information on his whereabouts.\n\nIn September, the group released an audio message said to be from Baghdadi praising the operations of IS affiliates in other regions.\n\nIt also called on scattered IS fighters to regroup and try to free thousands of their comrades held in jails and camps by the SDF in northeastern Syria.", "description": "US President Donald Trump has said that elusive Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been killed, dying \"like a dog\", in a daring, nighttime raid by US special forces deep in northwest Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9514/8a7c7bd58fe44bb98ef88857a12d326f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
