We are not in an easy situation and Japan is around the corner,\u201d the Pole said in a team release on Sunday.\n\nThe retirement in Sochi came shortly after Kubica\u2019s team mate George Russell had crashed out.\n\nWilliams, whose sole point this season was scored by Kubica in Germany, said Russell\u2019s crash was due to a problem with the wheel nut retainer that meant the right front on the British rookie\u2019s car was not sitting perfectly.\n\n\u201cThis caused a lock up under braking,\u201d said senior race engineer Dave Robson. \u201cThe design is very mature and well-proven. The remaining inventory will be inspected thoroughly and we do not anticipate a repeat of the issue.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we were forced to retire Robert\u2019s car due to the amount of accident damage we sustained in the Singapore-Russia back-to-back races in order to protect ourselves going into the next events.\u201d\n\nRobson said the team had worked hard to improve the number of parts available for the remaining races.", "description": "The Williams Formula One team defended their decision to retire Robert Kubica's car from last Sunday's Russian Grand Prix after the Polish driver's sponsors demanded an explanation on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436643188&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF92115-OCASP"}
