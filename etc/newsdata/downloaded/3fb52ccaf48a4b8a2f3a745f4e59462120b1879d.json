Scientists think these plaques are toxic to brain cells.\n\nBiogen's chief executive Michel Vounatsos said: \"We are hopeful about the prospect of offering patients the first therapy to reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nHilary Evans from Alzheimer's Research UK said: \"People affected by Alzheimer's have waited a long time for a life-changing new treatment and this exciting announcement offers new hope that one could be in sight.\n\n\"Taking another look at aducanumab is a positive step for all those who took part in the clinical trials and the worldwide dementia research community. As more data emerges, we hope it will spark global discussions about the next steps for delivering much-needed treatments into people's hands.\"\n\nProf Bart De Strooper, Director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at University College London, said: \"It is fantastic to hear of these new positive results emerging from the aducanumab trials. We currently have no effective treatments to slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's disease and I hope this signifies a turning point.\"", "description": "Drug company says it will seek permission in the US to start marketing a treatment that appears to slow Alzheimer's.", "authors": ["Michelle Roberts", "Health Editor", "Bbc News Online"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10B3D/production/_109331486_gettyimages-514232454.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
