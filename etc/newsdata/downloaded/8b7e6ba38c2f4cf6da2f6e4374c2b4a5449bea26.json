Photo: Christy Bush\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the most powerful hair dryer or the handiest chef\u2019s knife, those things can be easy enough to find. Other objects of desire are a little more taste-based. What\u2019s the next status water bottle or hand wash, for instance? Chris Black (he\u2019s a partner at brand consultancy Public Announcement) is here to help, in the form of a regular column. If you have a burning question about the next fanny pack or Noah rugby shirt, drop us an email with the subject line \u201cAsk Chris\u201d at strategist@nymag.com.\n\nNow that summer is over and it\u2019s time to bundle up, I am looking for a clean pair of sweatpants. Something slightly elevated that can be worn out of the house, neutral enough to go with everything, and ideally less than $300. What do you suggest?\n\n\ufeffFirst, we must tackle the most significant issue that comes along with this historically beloved garment. We have all seen it, some of us have even suffered from it: The Dreaded Outline\u2122. Unfortunately, the humble cotton sweatpant can show off, well, more than you\u2019d like to. It happened to Steve McQueen, and it will happen to you if you aren\u2019t careful. I will suggest some chic pairs \u2014 but wear them knowing you must do your best to spare your friends, family, and colleagues from seeing more than they would like. Comfort can come with a price!\n\nA.P.C. Adam Slim-Fit Tapered Logo-Print Loopback Cotton-Jersey Sweatpants This loopback cotton-jersey pair from A.P.C. is tapered, making them a little easier to wear in public. It also has a subtle, retro-inspired logo, if you are into that sort of thing. $190 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nSunspel Slim-Fit Fleece-Back Cotton and Cashmere-Blend Jersey Sweatpants Sunspel always does it right. These slim-fit, fleece-back sweatpants are cut from a very luxurious-sounding cotton-and-cashmere-blend jersey, come in a fall-appropriate army green, and are within our budget. Go ahead and get the extra scone. You deserve it. $285 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nDries Van Noten Slim-Fit Loopback Cotton-Jersey Sweatpants Both of the above pairs are great, but this navy pair from Dries Van Noten is probably my favorite in the $300-and-under category. The key is the polished silver zippers on the pockets, which will ensure personal effects stay secure. There\u2019s nothing chic about losing your wallet. $295 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nThe Row Olin Cotton-Jersey Sweatpants If you are willing to splurge, I\u2019d strongly consider these simple black drawstring sweatpants made with buttery Japanese cotton-jersey from The Row. You could even wear them to the opera! $590 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nStone Island Logo-Appliqu\u00e9d Garment-Dyed Fleece-Back David-TC Sweatpants Or, get LOUD baby. These garment-dyed Pepto pink sweats from my guys at Stone Island will for sure have heads turning at the dog run. They\u2019re straight leg, with an anti-drop, water-resistant coating, and zipper pockets. Sometimes you gotta flex! $590 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nI recently upgraded to the iPhone 11. It\u2019s a lot larger than my old iPhone, and I\u2019m terrified of a cracked screen. Can you recommend some cases that are sleek enough to fit in Levi\u2019s 501 pockets, but also offer some protection?\n\n\ufeffI hate phone cases, and have often said that they comprise the aesthetic of the device\u2019s excellent design! But when your phone has three cameras and costs $1,000, you would be a fool not to protect it.\n\nPeel Super Thin iPhone 11 Pro Case A few years ago, I discovered Peel via a targeted Instagram ad (SMFH), and I copped. It is the definition of \u201cbarely there,\u201d the price is right ($29!), and it fits in the pocket comfortably. If you fumble your phone and the case gets dinged, you buy another one, and it\u2019s like new! Peel also makes a great glass protector. $29 at Peel Buy\n\nOtterBox Commuter Series Case for iPhone 11 If you are a real klutz, I guess you need a big boy Otterbox. It does not fit nicely in the pocket, but chances are your jeans are less expensive to replace than your shiny new phone. $36 at Amazon Buy $36 at Amazon Buy\n\nAs we head into fall, can you recommend the chicest sneakers for women? I\u2019m looking for pairs to wear while running errands/hanging with friends on the weekends, not for working out.\n\n\ufeffInstead of boldly attempting to mansplain sneakers, I thought it would make more sense to once again call on my deep bullpen of brilliant and tasteful friends. To answer this query, I went all the way across the pond to tap London-based editor and consultant Emma Hope Allwood \u2014 who is currently the head of fashion at Dazed Digital, and a contributor to Strategist U.K. And I must say \u2026 she killed it. Emma, take it from here!\n\nNike White Shox Total Sneakers Shox are back, baby. After Comme des Gar\u00e7ons released a now sold-out take on the discontinued early aughts silhouette, the style is having a comeback. Get this silver and white pair if all black makes you feel too much like a \u201cgoes to Berlin once\u201d starter-pack meme. $170 at ASOS Buy $153 at Nike Buy\n\nSalomon Black Limited Edition S/Lab XT-6 Softground LT ADV Sneakers Technical sneakers \u2014 the kind that look like they were made for people who actually enjoy going outside in all weather conditions \u2014 are having a moment. Spotted everywhere at Fashion Week, Salomon\u2019s S/Lab models marry the French outdoors brand\u2019s nerdy knowledge with a sleeker silhouette. [Editor\u2019s note: The sneakers at the link below are listed in men\u2019s sizes, but according to Salomon, the S/Lab Xt-6s are unisex, and SSENSE is one of few retailers with multiple sizes in stock.] $220 at SSENSE Buy\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the retailer Aries x New Balance 991 Sneakers A last gasp of dad-shoe mania, this version of the New Balance 991 by London slacker-chic legends Aries comes in winter-blues-busting neon yellow. [Editor\u2019s note: These sneakers will be released on October 25, and you can sign up to \u201cshop first\u201d once they\u2019re available via the link below.] $285 at Aries Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
