REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals let stand an August 2017 preliminary injunction that required LinkedIn, a Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) unit with more than 645 million members, to give hiQ Labs Inc access to publicly available member profiles.\n\nThe 3-0 decision by the San Francisco appeals court sets back Silicon Valley\u2019s battle against \u201cdata scraping,\u201d or extracting information from social media accounts or websites, which critics say can equate to theft or violate users\u2019 privacy.\n\nCircuit Judge Marsha Berzon said hiQ, which makes software to help employers determine whether employees will stay or quit, showed it faced irreparable harm absent an injunction because it might go out of business without access.\n\nShe also said giving companies such as LinkedIn \u201cfree rein\u201d over who can use public user data risked creating \u201cinformation monopolies\u201d that harm the public interest.\n\n\u201cLinkedIn has no protected property interest in the data contributed by its users, as the users retain ownership over their profiles,\u201d Berzon wrote. \u201cAnd as to the publicly available profiles, the users quite evidently intend them to be accessed by others,\u201d including prospective employers.\n\nIn a statement, LinkedIn said it was disappointed with the decision and evaluating its options, and will \u201cfight to protect our members and the information they entrust\u201d to it.\n\nLawyers for hiQ did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case was returned to U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco, who issued the injunction.\n\nCraigslist, the classified ad website, had supported LinkedIn\u2019s appeal, warning that the injunction could have a \u201cdangerous impact\u201d by making it easier for \u201cbad actors\u201d to find targets for unwanted email, text or phone-based marketing.\n\nBerzon said, however, hiQ had raised serious questions about LinkedIn\u2019s conduct, including whether it could invoke a federal law targeting computer fraud and abuse to block \u201cfree riders\u201d from accessing user data.\n\n\u201cOf course, LinkedIn could satisfy its \u2018free rider\u2019 concern by eliminating the public access option, albeit at a cost to the preferences of many users and, possibly, to its own bottom line,\u201d she wrote.\n\nGregory Garre, a former U.S. solicitor general under President George W. Bush representing craigslist, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nDonald Verrilli, a solicitor general under President Barack Obama, represented LinkedIn. Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe was one of hiQ\u2019s lawyers.\n\nThe case is hiQ Labs Inc v LinkedIn Corp, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 17-16783.", "description": "A federal appeals court on Monday rejected LinkedIn's effort to stop a San Francisco company from using information that users of the professional networking website have deemed public.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428104829&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881LN", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
