The situation is getting out of hand. It is sickening that people can treat an area like this. They have taken a beautiful area and turned into a dump.\n\n'It looks like tipper trucks must have been down here to throw away this much waste.'\n\nPentavia Homes is a housing project dedicated to affordable housing to the Mill Hill area.\n\nClose to homes, the pile of rubbish is believed to have been dumped near the site of the disused Pentavia Retail Park in Mill Hill\n\nBroken furniture, soiled nappies and even a vending machine are among the assortment of items dumped at the site\n\nOne resident said: 'It looks like tipper trucks must have been down here to throw away this much waste'\n\nIn July, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan approved the plans to erect 844 homes in the project with some tower blocks 15 storeys high\n\nBarnet Council had refused the scheme after more than 680 objections but Mr Khan stepped in to approve the plan following a public hearing at City Hall on July 25.\n\nMattresses, vending machines and an assortment of other items have been dumped at the site of the disused Pentavia Retail Park.\n\nMr Montague said he was disgusted by the rubbish, commenting: 'I've seen some fly-tipping in my time but this is definitely the very worst. It's in Mill Hill in north London and it is just disgusting.\n\nMartin Montague, the founder of fly-tipping reporting app ClearWaste, discovered the mountain of rubbish\n\nMr Montague described it as the worst evidence of fly-tipping that he had ever seen\n\n'There are hundreds of tons of illegally dumped waste - everything from builders' rubbish to food and even soiled nappies.\n\n'It's a risk to health for the people who live nearby and an environmental disaster - and yet the local council and the owners of the land haven't cleaned it up.\n\n'We're campaigning to get it clean-up and put an end to the scourge of fly-tipping wherever it is. It's bad for the environment, can be fatal to wildlife and costs councils thousands and thousands of pounds to clean-up, money that could be better spent on things like schools or care for the elderly.\n\n'I'm determined to help to fight Britain's epidemic of fly-tipping, whether it's a site like this or a single bag dumped by a roadside.'\n\nTfL, Highways England and Pentavia Homes have been contacted for comment.", "description": "The video shows piles of rubbish including soiled nappies, building waste and even a vending machine dumped near a residential area in Mill Hill in north London.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/11/19390962-0-image-a-15_1570445274573.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
