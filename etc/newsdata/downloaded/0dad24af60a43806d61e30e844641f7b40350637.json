It is an incredibly challenging task, and the Ethereum Foundation has been completely transparent about its roadmap and progress. That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited to announce that Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake is joining us at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin.\n\nJustin Drake will give us an update on Ethereum 2.0. He\u2019s been working on sharding and scalability in order to better support the Ethereum ecosystem and enable new use cases.\n\nThe current version of Ethereum can only handle a dozen transactions per second. With sharding, the computing load will be partitioned, which should lead to a drastic increase in performance.\n\nAnd the most fascinating part of Ethereum 2.0 is that it\u2019s a moving target. The Ethereum community has put years of research and development in the update in order to refine how it\u2019s going to work and how it\u2019s going to be rolled out. It\u2019s a large scale experiment of distributed development.\n\nEthereum 2.0 will be rolled out in multiple phases in order to ensure the finality of a transaction, construct shard chains and make sure smart contracts run properly. If that sounds complicated, Justin Drake can tell you in simple words why Ethereum is such an interesting project.\n\nEthereum 2.0 could transform the Ethereum blockchain into a sort of \u201cworld computer\u201d that can execute instructions across a network of servers all around the world. And that\u2019s what so exciting about it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. In addition to an interview on Ethereum, Justin Drake will also talk about building a blockchain startup on the Extra Crunch stage with other blockchain experts.\n\nHe knows how important it is to build a community of developers and researchers around your blockchain project. And he can tell you about the best strategies to communicate and iterate on complicated blockchain projects.\n\nBuy your ticket to Disrupt Berlin to listen to those discussions \u2014 and many others. The conference will take place December 11-12.\n\nIn addition to panels and fireside chats, like this one, new startups will participate in the Startup Battlefield to compete for the highly coveted Battlefield Cup.", "description": "The Ethereum community is hard at work on Ethereum 2.0, the next major upgrade of its blockchain.
