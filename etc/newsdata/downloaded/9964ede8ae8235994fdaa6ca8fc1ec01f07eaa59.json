Cardinal John Henry Newman has now become a saint.\n\nHe is the first British person to be sainted since 1976. And he is the first English saint of the modern era.\n\nThe theologian and poet was canonised by Pope Francis in front of tens of thousands of pilgrims in St Peter\u2019s Square in the Vatican.\n\nPrince Charles, who represented the UK at the ceremony, called the cardinal a man of principle, and paid tribute to his enlightened thoughts on faith, education and conscience.\n\nCharles added: \u201cWhatever our own beliefs, we can only be grateful to Newman for the gifts, rooted in his Catholic faith, which he shared with wider society.\u201d\n\nQuoting some of the Cardinal\u2019s inspirational words about faith, Pope Francis said: \u201cLet us ask to be like \u2018kindly lights amid the encircling gloom\u2019.\u201d\n\nA large image of Cardinal Newman \u2013 alongside four others who were canonised on Sunday \u2013 was bathed in sun as it hung on the front of St Peter\u2019s Basilica at the ceremony.\n\nJohn Henry Newman was born in the City of London in 1801, the eldest of six children to a banker dad and mum of Huguenot descent.\n\nHe studied at Oxford University and became a prominent Anglican priest.\n\nIn the 1830s he was a founder and leading light of controversial Anglican group the Oxford Movement which wanted to reintroduce some Catholic beliefs and rituals. It developed into Anglo-Catholicism.\n\nDespite the steps he had taken, Newman\u2019s switch to Catholicism in 1845 was still a shock \u2013 so controversial that one of his sisters is reputed to have never spoken to him again.\n\nNewman later moved from Oxford to Birmingham where he spent 30 years looking after the poor and sick.\n\nHe was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1847, and founded the Birm\u00adingham Oratory, a school in the city, and a university that was the precursor of University College Dublin.\n\nHe was made a cardinal in 1879. His written works include The Dream of Gerontius, later set to music by Elgar. Newman died in 1890 aged 89.\n\nCarol Parkinson, of the Friends of Newman, who travelled to Rome from Birmingham for Sunday\u2019s ceremony, said: \u201cHis integrity, friendship, loyalty and hard work set a very good example to everyone. When we heard he was [being] made a saint, many people were in tears and so excited.\n\n\u201cThe work the cardinal did here continues. He worked in prisons, his group of Oratorians worked in hospitals, in schools. He was a friend to everybody... the poor, the rich, the famous, the unknown.\u201d\n\nThe Vatican must authenticate two miracles to declare someone a saint. In death, Newman was credited with curing a man\u2019s spinal disease and a woman\u2019s potentially fatal bleeding.\n\nAfter praying to him for help in 2013, Melissa Villalobos, of Chicago, recovered from a torn placenta that threatened her and her unborn baby\u2019s life. The mum, 42, hailed Newman for the \u201cenormity of his loving heart\u201d.\n\nIn 2000, Jack Sullivan, of Boston, Massachusetts, was struck by crippling back pain as he studied to become a deacon. He said he prayed to Cardinal Newman to help him \u201cwalk so that I can return to classes and be ordained\u201d. He added the pain had gone by the next day.\n\nJack and Melissa joined the congregation at the Vatican on Sunday.\n\nHow saint is created", "description": "First English saint of the modern era, who died in 1890, has been canonised by Pope Francis I", "authors": ["Stephen White"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571744.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195423052.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
