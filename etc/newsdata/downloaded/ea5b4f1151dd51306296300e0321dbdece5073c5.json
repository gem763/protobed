And he has taken a stance that no other major Democratic presidential candidate has touched: calling for mandatory assault weapon buybacks.\n\nAfter months of campaigning without a clear, cohesive narrative or signature issues for voters to latch onto, with sometimes wobbly answers on why he is different from the 20-some other Democrats running for president, O\u2019Rourke has a message and an explanation for why he is the person to deliver it: what\u2019s happening now in America is fucked up, and he has seen up close both how much that hurts and how to fix it\u2026\n\nBut another thing was different from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s early presidential campaign. In both Blacksburg and in Charlottesville, O\u2019Rourke had to take questions about why he wasn\u2019t abandoning his presidential bid to run for a Senate seat in Texas.\n\nIt was a question no one asked him during his first trip to Iowa, in March, immediately after he began his campaign for president. But it has dogged him, to his aides\u2019 frustration, since the El Paso shooting.", "description": "", "authors": ["Buzzfeednews.Com Article Mollyhensleyclancy Utm_Medium Twitter"], "top_image": ""}
