From 50, we became 500. Today we have thousands of people who are coming,\u201d he says.\n\nMouracade, who is the CEO of the Beirut Marathon, says he and other volunteers mostly find a lot of plastic bottles.\n\nWhen he first started out on Saturday, it followed a night of several people overturning trash dumpsters and setting them alight, or even breaking shop windows.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who are feeling a lot of anger and a lot of pain, that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much destruction,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cWe need to respect the voice of the people, and our duty is to clean\u201d afterwards.\n\nLebanon\u2019s economy has been on the brink of collapse for some time and the latest protests grew after proposed tax hikes on phone calls on free applications \u2014 a proposal since scrapped.\n\nBut the demonstrations have morphed into a huge popular outcry against what is viewed as a broken system.\n\nThe last such huge movement against the political class was in 2015 under the slogan \u201cYou Stink\u201d, after the capital\u2019s main trash dump brimmed full and refuse flooded the streets.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Throw them out\u2019 \u2013\n\nOn the square, female volunteers scoop up piles of used half lemons \u2014 some with rind curling off them \u2014 and burnt trash.\n\nSuheil Hamdan, 49, films them with his mobile phone, seemingly making a video to share on social media.\n\n\u201cThis is where corrupt lawmakers and ministers in our country belong \u2014 in the bin bags,\u201d he says, a cap on his head to keep off the sun.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t leave the street until all our corrupt lawmakers and ministers are in prison,\u201d he says.\n\nNear an iconic cinema abandoned since the 1975-1990 civil war, even a few foreigners have turned up.\n\nA group of Asian workers who usually clean the capital\u2019s streets smile as they lean on their brooms, dressed in faded grey overalls, but refuse to speak to AFP.\n\nWhite earphones stuffed in his ears, their supervisor is standing nearby.\n\nA Swiss woman watches as her six-year-old son drops scraps into a large trash bag, his hands protected by oversized pink washing-up gloves.\n\nBut first and foremost, cleaning up is about being Lebanese.\n\nSami Deeb, a 34-year-old, has taken the day off from running his struggling food distribution business.\n\n\u201cWe have been on the ground for four days fighting for our rights,\u201d he says, dressed in an immaculately pressed pink shirt.\n\nFor days, he has been taking part in the protests, which late Sunday evolved into euphoric celebrations complete with humoristic songs, DJs, and traditional dabke dancing.\n\n\u201cWe clean in the morning, and we party at night,\u201d he says.", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 Medical student Lynn Abi Khalil, 17, says she could not take part in Lebanon\u2019s massive spontaneous protests against the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/eb877f_lebanese-demonstrators-clean-up-rubbish-on-street-in-capital-beirut-downtown-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
