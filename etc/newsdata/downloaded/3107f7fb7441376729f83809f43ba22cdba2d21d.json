(Family photo)\n\nAs Wendy Martinez\u2019s family and friends stood at a lectern in a D.C. courtroom, tearfully speaking about how the 35-year-old was loved and the impact she had on their lives, the stranger who killed her sat a few feet away. He rocked in his chair and, at times, smiled.\n\nAnthony Crawford had pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the Sept. 18, 2018, fatal stabbing of Martinez as she was out for an evening run in Logan Circle. And on Friday, a D.C. Superior Court judge sentenced him to 30 years in prison for the random killing.\n\nAuthorities say Crawford stole a kitchen knife with a 5\u00bd-inch blade from a nearby Giant supermarket, walked about five blocks and, as Martinez was stopped at an intersection to wait for the traffic light, stabbed her seven times. Crawford ran off, leaving a trail of blood, authorities said. Martinez staggered into a nearby Chinese carryout, where patrons tried desperately to save her life.\n\nThe random, brutal slaying of the woman who just six days earlier was celebrating her engagement with her family and friends stunned the city, leaving many runners and joggers with a sense of vulnerability and outrage.\n\nBefore he was sentenced, Crawford, 23, stood up with legs and ankles in shackles and spoke for the first time publicly about killing Martinez.\n\n\u201cI want to apologize to my family for my poor decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to apologize to the Martinez family for my poor decision. I don\u2019t know what else to say about my mental health.\u201d\n\n[His fiancee was killed on a run in Logan Circle. He was left with the rest of his life.]\n\nCourt records show Crawford had a history of mental illness and had used synthetic drugs that can cause delusions. He was arrested in a park he frequented a mile north of where Martinez was stabbed. After his arrest, Crawford\u2019s attorneys said he did not test positive for any synthetic drugs but had tested positive for cocaine.\n\nBefore the judge sentenced Crawford, his public defender, Dana Page, said it still remains unclear what caused her client to attack the petite runner.\n\n\u201cHe is trying to understand what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is searching for the reasons. But we all know the reason. It\u2019s Mr. Crawford\u2019s mental illness.\u201d\n\nPage said Crawford has been receiving treatment. \u201cThe monster is not Mr. Crawford,\u201d she said. \u201cThe monster is his brain.\u201d\n\n\n\nCora Martinez, mother of Wendy Martinez, speaks during a 2018 vigil at Logan Circle. (Oliver Contreras for The Washington Post)\n\nCrawford, according to his attorneys, chose not to pursue a mental illness defense and instead decided to plead guilty. Several of Crawford\u2019s family members sat in the back of the courtroom but did not speak during the proceeding.\n\nSeveral of Martinez\u2019s family members and friends tearfully described the young woman whose laugh resonated throughout a room and whose love of God, family and friends inspired so many.\n\nCora Martinez repeatedly referred to her daughter as her \u201cprincess\u201d and said Wendy Martinez was Crawford\u2019s \u201cperfect target.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe only did what hundreds of people do each day,\u201d she said. \u201cShe took a run in the city that she loved.\u201d\n\nSeveral of Martinez\u2019s family members referenced another recent fatal attack, the Aug. 27 slaying of 27-year-old Margery Magill as she walked a dog in a Northwest Washington neighborhood just after 8:30 p.m. A hearing for the 24-year-old arrested and charged with that slaying \u2014 who according to court records also has a history of mental illness \u2014 is scheduled for Monday.\n\n[Woman walking dog killed in apparent random attack]\n\n\u201cThis is the worst nightmare I have ever lived,\u201d Cora Martinez said. \u201cI feel for the mothers who have children in this city, for young people who wanted to come to this city to help this world. I feel for those parents. I want this city to be a safer place to live, work and help the world.\u201d\n\nShe and Daniel Hincapie, Wendy Martinez\u2019s fiance, both spoke of Wendy\u2019s Christian faith, which they said would direct her to show love and mercy, even to the man who stole her life.\n\n\u201cI do not wish for anything bad for you,\u201d Hincapie said, turning toward Crawford. \u201cI hope you will begin a path of peace and redemption. What you did was horrible, but nothing is impossible. I hope you give it a try.\u201d\n\nA 30-year prison sentence is the mandatory minimum for first-degree murder in the District. \u201cYou cruelly, viciously, savagely and needlessly ended the life of someone who everyone seems to agree was a wonderful person,\u201d Judge Craig Iscoe said before issuing the sentence.\n\n\u201cI recognize the mental issues that may have contributed to these actions,\u201d the judge said, \u201cbut they have created inescapable, enduring and permanent harm.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWith a letter of support from Kim Kardashian-West, D.C. man convicted of murder as a teen gets a second chance\n\nDriver charged in crash that killed two men sitting on park bench in D.C.\n\nBefore he died in prison, prosecutors were trying to cut down his 40-year prison sentence\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Wendy Martinez, 35, killed last September, was newly engaged and worked for a tech company.", "authors": ["Keith L.
