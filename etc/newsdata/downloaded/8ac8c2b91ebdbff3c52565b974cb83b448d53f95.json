Unsurprisingly, head coach Rassie Erasmus has rung the changes for the clash, making 13 in total as he looks to keep his side fresh for the knockout stages.

We always look at the previous game and see where we can improve,\" he said. \"You do look at the other team, their attacking players and how they kick.\n\n\"But we don\u2019t really know what to expect from their individuals, so we will do our own preparations.\" It\u2019s a big game today for Damian Willemse, who starts at full back less than a week after arriving in Japan as a late injury replacement.\n\nFull-back Willemse replaces Jesse Kriel, who has been ruled out of the rest of the World Cup.\n\nErasmus says Willemse, who had a recent stint with Saracens, \"would have probably made the World Cup squad if he wasn't injured\".\n\nWillemse, 21, added: \"I'm really excited to play. I've been out for three months. I've got that hunger and it's been good to get some game time for Sarries.\"\n\nOf the 13 changes made to the starting line-up, only Springboks captain Siya Kolisi and centre Damian de Allende have retained their places. South Africa head coach Rassie Erasmus has sent a firm warning to his players about today's clash, insisting there can't be any room for a let-up in intensity against a side that has so far shipped 111 points at the tournament.\n\nThe Springboks will seal their place in the quarter-finals with a bonus-point win, barring Italy pulling off a huge upset in their last game against New Zealand, and Erasmus has made 13 changes after Friday's 49-3 win against Italy.\n\n\"One of the areas which will be vital going into the knockout stages is intensity and big moments, and the intensity at which quarter-final and semi-final rugby is being played,\" Erasmus said this week.\n\n\"If this team doesn't at least match that or step up, they will struggle to stay in team selection and make the team. They know that, and that will be one of the challenges.\" Hello again! I'm in place at Kobe\u2019s Misaki Stadium where the roof is once again on, making for typically humid conditions. As such, both teams will need to be vigilant when it comes to controlling possession and handling. All three previous games in Kobe \u2014 England vs United States, Scotland vs Samoa, Ireland vs Russia \u2014 have suffered from more than 30 handling errors each. But, in every case, the Tier One side has come through as the victor.\n\nAdvertisement Hello all and welcome to The Independent's live coverage of this morning's Rugby World Cup clash between South Africa and Canada.\n\n\n\nI'll be bringing you all the live action, reaction and analysis from Kobe - so make sure to stay tuned!\n\nWhat time does it start?\n\nSouth Africa vs Canada kicks off at 7.15pm Japan Standard Time, which is 11.15am BST, on Tuesday 8 October.\n\nWhere can I watch it?\n\nThe match will be broadcast on ITV.
