Ministers assure us they are moving towards a deal. The European Union tells us they are not \u2013 because no new or viable proposals have been put forward by the British government. The prime minister tells us he wishes to have a deal with Europe. But we don\u2019t see him sitting down in Brussels, hammering out an agreement.\n\nTory moderates may have to fight to get their party back | Gaby Hinsliff Read more\n\nLip service is paid to the unanimous judgment of the supreme court \u2013 that it was unlawful to prorogue parliament for five weeks \u2013 while the prime minister tells us the court was wrong and he was right. That is the cry of those found guilty of misdemeanours throughout the ages.\n\nMeanwhile, ministers continue to offer fantasy outcomes of what a post-Brexit future holds for people in every corner of our United Kingdom. As day succeeds day, it seems more likely that we will end up leaving the European Union without any deal at all. On Wednesday night, the prime minister wilfully destroyed any hope of cross-party agreement.\n\nThe price of such a negotiating failure will be widespread and will affect rich and poor alike \u2013 with one difference: the poor will be far less able to protect themselves.\n\nFar more is at stake than simply our relationship with the European Union. At stake also is our relationship with the wider world and \u2013 because of the nature of our Brexit debate \u2013 very probably the future of our domestic politics as well.\n\nI don\u2019t believe, after the schism Brexit has created, that we will be able to return to the status quo ante. The government constantly tells us that everyone is fed up with Brexit. So am I. They tell us everyone wants an end to Brexit. So do I. But no one should believe that Brexit will end on the day we leave \u2013 whether that is on 31 October, or beyond. Far from it. The impact of Brexit \u2013 both internally and externally \u2013 will be felt negatively for a very long time.\n\nI hope our millions of traditional, moderate supporters understand that this Conservative government is an aberration\n\nFrom the outset, the government\u2019s whole negotiating strategy \u2013 if such it can be called \u2013 has been driven by a desire to win the support of the anti-European hard right of the Conservative party, together with like-minded media.\n\nIf the government is to get a deal; if the House of Commons is to approve it; if the scars of Brexit are to be diminished; then there must be compromise in the negotiations. And not only compromise, but understanding \u2013 from both sets of negotiators. Little of that has been forthcoming.\n\nThere is much talk of a general election. In the present atmosphere it would be likely to become the most unsavoury election of modern times. Until Brexit is resolved, a general election would solve nothing. It would merely fuel the current feeling of disillusionment and disunity. It may also be pointless, as the most likely outcome is another fragmented parliament \u2013 even more bitterly divided than it is now.\n\nSo why is the government so keen to put our country through that? There may be a political calculation: they believe the Labour party is unelectable under the present leadership; ministers know how serious the problems will be for the people of this country after a no-deal Brexit, and wish to have the election out of the way before the reality of the mess that lies ahead becomes clear.\n\nLet me put it another way: if the government was truly confident in the aftermath of their Brexit policy, they would wait for next spring, when they could take credit for the success of Brexit; rejoice \u2013 even gloat \u2013 that all fears about it were unfounded; and propose a few popular one nation policies to restore the fortunes of the Conservatives.\n\nBut instead, to reinforce their electoral appeal, the government seems intent on whipping up dissent by using highly emotional and evocative language that can only provoke fear and anger, and fuel grievances against parliament and the law \u2013 inciting opposition to the most important bulwarks of our state and its freedom.\n\nTheir approach is profoundly un-Conservative and \u2013 whatever its short-term effect \u2013 will do permanent damage to the reputation of the party. I cannot believe any previous government in our long history would have even considered such reckless and divisive behaviour.\n\nWe were promised, during the referendum campaign, that Brexit would \u201c\u2026 restore parliamentary sovereignty and the supremacy of UK law\u201d. For that reason, I am assuming there will be no further political trickery from this government.\n\nThere is a contradiction between the act prohibiting the UK leaving the EU without a deal, and the prime minister\u2019s continued assertion that he will leave on 31 October.\n\nMy fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law by passing an order of council to suspend the act until after 31 October. It is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving the Queen.\n\nI should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no one should ever forgive or forget.\n\nI am a lifelong Conservative. I hope our millions of traditional, moderate, middle-of-the-road supporters understand that this Conservative government\u2019s present position is an aberration.\n\nMost Conservatives are not a Brexit party tribute band, nor have we abandoned our core values to find compromise, seek allies, and strive for unity, rather than division and disarray. We abhor the language of division and hate \u2013 and words such as \u201csaboteur\u201d, \u201ctraitor\u201d, \u201cenemy\u201d, \u201csurrender\u201d, \u201cbetrayal\u201d have no place in our party, our politics, nor in our society. It is emphatically not who we are as a people. And must never be seen as so.\n\nI hope the Conservative parliamentary party will regain its sense of balance, and rein in the faction of a faction that now prevails in cabinet.\n\nNow that parliament is sitting again, it has the opportunity to prove its quality, its strength, its purpose and its power. I hope that every member of parliament \u2013 from all parties \u2013 will unite together, and rise to that challenge.\n\n\u2022 John Major is a former prime minister.
