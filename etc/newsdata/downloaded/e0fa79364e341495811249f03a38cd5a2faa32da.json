It is now officially the most expensive Pok\u00e9mon card in existence.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cPikachu Illustrator\u201d card, a promo given out to winners of a comic contest that was held in Japan in 1997-98. While there were 39 of these cards awarded, it\u2019s believed only 10 are left today, making each one of them insanely valuable.\n\nSo valuable that someone was willing to pay $US195,000 ($285,831) for a single Pok\u00e9mon card, which is almost 4x the price paid for the last Pikachu Illustrator to hit auction back in 2013, which \u201conly\u201d went for $US54,970 ($80,575).\n\nPikachu Illustrator is notable for a few things other than its rarity. It\u2019s the only card to say ILLUSTRATOR at the top of the card, and the only to have a pen as its icon in the bottom right. The unique art\u2014by Pikachu\u2019s creator, Atsuko Nishida\u2014is also pretty damn amazing.", "description": "One of the rarest Pok\u00e9mon cards in existence went up for auction last week at New York-based Weiss, and sold for $US195,000 ($285,831).
