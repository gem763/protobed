I mean, if I'm going to buy something anyway, I might as well save on it. This Tuesday is one of those days. I found incredible prices on Echo Shows, Ember mugs, meat thermometers, and more. Even better, we've personally tested these products and price tracked them, so you know you're getting your money's worth.\n\n1. $25 off: A compact Echo show\n\nThis compact Echo Show performs similarly as the big guy at a fraction of the price. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThis Prime Day, I decided to get an Echo Show 5 because it was a whopping $40. I love that its a compact version of the popular Show model, but it still has a screen so I can see timers, get visual weather forecasts, and sing along to lyrics of the songs I don't know. It's smaller size also makes it more affordable\u2014and it's even more affordable right now with this deal. Right now, $25 is knocked off it's price tag, which is its second lowest price since by $15.\n\nGet the Echo Show 5 for $64.99 (Save $25)\n\n2. 10% off: This popular warming mug\n\nLukewarm coffee will be a thing of the past. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nThere are few things more annoying than making your favorite cup of tea, only to have it lukewarm 20 minutes late. Most mugs can't keep things at optimal drinking temperature, so you have limited time for the perfect sip, which is terrible for forgetful people like me. The Ember mug, however, comes with a nifty app that lets you set the perfect temperature of whatever you're drinking for up to two hours. I tested and loved the Ember Travel Mug, but you can get their ceramic mug for just $72 right now, which is great for home or the office.\n\nGet the Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug for $71.95 (Save $8)\n\n3. Lowest price: A great basic yoga mat\n\nGet into your flow with this affordable mat. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nIf you ever wanted to pick up yoga, but don't want to pay for an expensive mat, then this is the deal for you. This mat from AmazonBasics is the best starter yoga mat we've ever tested. We found that it has great cushioning for beginner's knees, had a non-slip surface, and was affordable enough that you won't feel bad about buying it if you quit yoga after a month. Right now, you can get it at its lowest price in a variety of colors, so there's no excuse to start practicing downward dog.\n\nGet the AmazonBasics 1/2-Inch Extra Thick Exercise Mat for $16.51 (Save $2.48)\n\n4. Lowest price: A probe thermometer for expert roasting\n\nMonitor you turkey this Thanksgiving. (Photo: ThermoPro)\n\nIf you don't want to overcook your turkey (again) this Thanksgiving, then you're going to want to use a probe meat thermometer. they allow you to continuously read the temperature of whatever you're roasting or grilling\u2014without opening the oven door. This one from ThermoPro is one of the best probe thermometers we've ever tested because it comes with two probes, you can monitor your meat wirelessly, and it has a clear alarm.
