Their children\u2019s inability to obtain healthcare and education services or permission to work prompted a push by politicians and bureaucrats within Iran\u2019s institutions to change the rule, as has been done in a number of Arab countries. Iran now joins Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria in reforming their citizenship laws, but Lebanon, Jordan and Syria still lag behind.\n\n\u201cDue to the large population of refugees and migrants in Iran there are thousands of children of \u2018mixed\u2019 parentage that are not given citizenship status and thus are denied access to social services, such as healthcare,\u201d said Assal Rad, a researcher at the National Iranian American Council. \u201cThe new law would provide those children with citizenship and grant them their rightful access to such services.\u201d\n\nThe law came about after campaigns by women\u2019s rights activists that began in the late 1990s.\n\n\u201cThis was driven by pressure for years from below,\u201d said Ms Bajoghli. \u201cThe tipping point came when wives of Iranian diplomats began to put pressure on their husbands because they were living abroad and that\u2019s one of the biggest complaints they heard from Iranian women living abroad. They saw it as an issue that should be fixable.\u201d\n\nScholars also say the rising clout of Afghans inside Iran may have also prodded the Council of Guardians to go against its ultra-conservative track record and approve the law. That thousands of Afghan migrants took up arms in the Iranian effort to bolster Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria may have boosted the image of Afghans in conservative circles that dominate the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe state has to increasingly pay attention to them over time,\u201d said Kevan Harris, a sociologist specialising in Iran at the University of California in Los Angeles. \u201cAnd not all of these families are poor. There is a rising Afghan-headed middle class.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They are among hundreds of thousands of Afghans who've lived in Iran since the beginning of their countries wars in the 1980s without paths to naturalisation.\n\n\"Many of them have lived in the country for up to four decades, have contributed enormously to the economy in back-breaking jobs, and have gone about quietly improving their situations through education and hard work,\" she said. \"They have also integrated well into Iranian urban neighbourhoods, share Iranian culture, speak Persian with an Iranian accent, and a large proportion are also committed Shi'a Muslims. This probably accounts for their growing voice in the country's political life.\"\n\nDemographic factors including an ageing workforce and declining birth rates have made Iran friendlier towards immigration. Mr Harris also suggested that there was rising pressure from international organisations such as the UN High Commission on Refugees, which continues to bankroll projects in Iran for those escaping conflicts in neighbouring Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nTo pass the law, parliament had to give way on security screening for anyone obtaining citizenship, which allowed the intelligence branch of the Revolutionary Guard to vet any applicant.\n\nThe new rules don\u2019t completely equalise access to citizenship. Iranian women must still apply for nationality for their children, while it is automatic for men\u2019s children.\n\n\u201cThe children of all citizens, whether men or women, should instead be granted citizenship on an equal basis,\u201d the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said earlier this year.\n\nDespite the caveats, those inside Iran celebrated the change as a step forward. \"Any law that improves the lives of Iranian people is a step forward,\" said one Tehran social scientist, who spoke on condition her name not be published. \"There are so many limitations in Iran that each step forward is a good one.\"", "description": "Iran has approved a\u00a0law allowing Iranian\u00a0mothers who are married to foreigners to pass on their citizenship to their children \u2013\u00a0elating rights campaigners who have been struggling for decades to reform the discriminatory practice.
