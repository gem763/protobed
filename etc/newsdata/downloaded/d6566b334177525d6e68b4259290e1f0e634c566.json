Yet there are a number of important steps that a homeowner can take to ensure that their hard-earned money is being put to good use.\n\nIncrease your bond repayment:\n\nWhen you borrow money to purchase a home you are in effect taking out two loans. The first loan is to repay the capital amount (known as the principal sum) and the second loan is to repay the interest charged over the period of the loan.\n\nThe majority of the money you repay in the first years of having a home loan goes towards paying back this interest, which will only marginally reduce the principal sum.\n\nIn South Africa, interest is generally calculated daily on your mortgage. In effect this means that the amount you owe the bank increases every day. Because of the nature of compound interest, regular additional repayments made at the beginning of your loan term will have a much greater effect on the cost of your bond than if you start paying extra cash into your bond account five or ten years down the line. However, even if you are already a number of years into your loan term, you can still make a considerable saving by paying additional money into your bond. By increasing your monthly instalments, you\u2019ll reduce the term of your bond, which means that you won\u2019t be paying heavy bond instalments in later years. The end result is that you will have paid less money in interest over the term of the loan.\n\nCalculate your bond repayments>\n\nThere are a number of easy ways that you can put additional money into your bond without really feeling the difference in your pocket:\n\nPut the additional income you receive from your annual salary increase into your home loan\n\nWhen interest rates decrease contact your lender and ask them to maintain the installment that you were paying prior to the drop on lending rates\n\nPut a portion of your annual bonus into your bond At SA Home Loans, you may put extra money into your bond anytime you want to. Every little bit helps. Making a prepayment when the loan registers is particularly helpful, as you will reduce the capital amount immediately, significantly reducing the total interest payable over the term of the loan.\n\nUse your bond as an interest - bearing savings account:\n\nBanks are in business to make profit so it makes sense that they charge a higher interest rate to people borrowing money from them than they do to investors who deposit funds with them. For example you might be receiving 2% interest on a positive balance for money in your savings account, but are probably being charged a much higher rate for the money you\u2019ve borrowed to pay off your home loan.\n\nBy depositing your savings into your bond, you are in effect receiving the interest rate that the bank charges you on your loan as positive interest on the money you invest For example, if you have a bond for R1 million, and you deposit an extra R100 000 into your home loan, you are now no longer being charged interest on R1 million, but rather on R900 000. The money you save in interest over the time that you keep the R100 000 in your home loan is the positive interest you are in effect receiving on the money you\u2019ve deposited. Plus you can apply to withdraw this cash when you need it (Remember that your monthly instalment would need to be fixed at the amount prior to the pre-payment - as at every reset date, the new instalment is calculated based on the new outstanding balance). At SA Home Loans, clients may make six withdrawals per annum of amounts greater than R10 000.\n\nConsolidate your debt:\n\nInterest rates charged on home loans are generally a lot lower than the rates you will pay for vehicle finance, credit cards and store accounts. So it makes financial sense to consolidate these debts into your home loan. But of course home loans are calculated over a much longer period than these other short-term loans, so it\u2019s imperative that you maintain the installment you were making prior to moving the debt across to your home loan in order to pay it off over the same time period. If you pay the short-term loan balance off over the full life of the home loan \u2013 often 20 years or more - it will end up costing you a lot more in interest.\n\nBuild up a good credit history:\n\nYou can build up a good credit history by repaying your home loan on time every month. Lending institutions will look at an applicant\u2019s credit history when deciding whether or not to grant a loan, and will also consider their credit rating when determining what interest rate to charge a client. Thus, by paying off your home loan in a responsible manner, you might end up saving yourself money in terms of lower interest rates on future loans.\n\nWhat must I do if I have difficulty paying my home loan instalment?\n\nSkipping your home loan repayments should be avoided \u2013 not only will missed payments impact on your credit record, but it will also increase the capital balance outstanding on your loan, which will increase the overall interest payable. If you fail to meet your payment commitments over a period of time, it could lead to legal action and the loss of your home. So it\u2019s important to prioritise your home loan repayments each month.\n\nCommunicate with your lending institution\n\nIf you are having trouble paying your monthly home loan instalment, the most important thing that you must do is to tell your lender about the problem. People often try to avoid contacting their lender because they don\u2019t want to face up to the situation they\u2019re in, or fear they will be reprimanded. By contacting the lending institution you may be able to make an arrangement that will help you, such as allowing you to pay off the arrears gradually alongside your usual payments. Your lender will discuss the options available to you based on your particular circumstances.\n\nLooking after your investment:\n\nMaintaining your home\n\nOwning your own home is a wonderful thing, but with it comes the responsibility of looking after the property in order to ensure that the money you\u2019ve invested isn\u2019t thrown away. Houses require a lot of time and money to keep them in good condition, but this is money well spent \u2013 since it is far more expensive to replace items than it is to maintain them.\n\nPay special attention to the following areas in your home:\n\nWooden door and window frames\n\nThe weather in South Africa can be very harsh on items such as wooden frames. To prevent wooden frames from rotting, homeowners should varnish their wood as and when is needed, which might be as often as every six months. It\u2019s also important that people who have wooden floors keep a lookout for borer and other wood-eating insects.\n\nClean your gutters regularly\n\nGutters that aren\u2019t cleaned out will become ineffective over time and may cause damage to your walls and ultimately your foundations. Maintaining your gutters will also mean they will last for years to come.\n\nPaintwork\n\nIf your house needs repainting, it's better to spend the money on a good quality paint as this will save you money in the long term. Ensure that outside walls are cleaned regularly.\n\nSwimming pools\n\nMust be maintained regularly in order to avoid structural problems or the need for resurfacing. Check the PH balance every two weeks and backwash your pool once a week.\n\nGarden\n\nThe value of your property can increase significantly with a beautiful garden. Make sure that your garden is well-kept and think about investing in indigenous plants. Indigenous gardens are easier to maintain and are becoming more and more popular with home buyers. Additionally, they use fewer resources such as water and fertiliser.\n\nMonitor developments in your neighbourhood:\n\nIt\u2019s important that you\u2019re aware of any developments in your neighbourhood that may have a negative or positive impact on the value of your home. If you\u2019re proactive about the area you live in, you won\u2019t be taken by surprise and may be able to have a say regarding any potential changes in your neighbourhood. The following are some of the things that you can do to make an impact:\n\nParticipate in local police forums.\n\nHold regular neighbourhood meetings to discuss issues that affect your community, such as crime or litter.\n\nTake note of any new buildings or renovations.\n\nMake sure that you know the name of your ward councillor.\n\nHome improvements:\n\nMaking additions to your home or renovating existing spaces can be a nerve-wracking process, but done intelligently, the money you spend can turn out to be a wise investment. The rule of thumb is that renovations to bathrooms and kitchens are most likely to increase the value of your property, but adding additional space to your house can also serve you well. Not only will you increase the value of your property, but by adding a garden cottage or similar structure, you are also providing the means to gain rental income which can be used to help pay off your bond.\n\nIf you are thinking about making home improvements, you should be aware of the following:\n\nEnsure that you have planning permission if necessary.\n\nTry to use a builder who is registered with the National Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC).\n\nResearch the prices of similar properties in your neighbourhood, so that you don\u2019t make the mistake of over-capitalising your property.\n\nBe aware that building work nearly always takes longer than you or your builder think it will, and often costs considerably more than the original quote.\n\nSource: SA Home Loans\n\nBack to homepage.", "description": "", "authors": ["Sa Home Loans"], "top_image": "https://myhome.24.com/Making-your-bond-work-for-you/assets/HqiYjg4cTZ/istock-943940212-2054x1460.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
