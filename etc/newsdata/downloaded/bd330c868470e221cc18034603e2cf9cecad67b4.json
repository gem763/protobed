The trial is expected to last until 2023.\n\nThey are represented by consumer group VZBV which accuses VW of having deliberately put its consumers at risk by installing software to cheat emissions test.\n\nAhead of the hearing, the group's president, Klaus Muller, said: \"In our opinion, Volkswagen cheated and must, therefore, be held accountable.\"\n\n\"It is long overdue for Volkswagen to recognise its responsibility. If this does not happen, the company would have lost its last chance to win back the consumers' trust,\" VZBV also said in a statement to Euronews.\n\nHowever, even if the court rules in favour of plaintiffs, they will not automatically be compensated and will have to file individual claims.\n\n\"We want swift proceedings. It doesn't help anyone if this process is dragged out unnecessarily,\" VW said in a statement to Euronews, adding, however, that they are \"preparing for a lengthy procedure.\"\n\nThe company dismissed the argument their cars are harmful, writing: \"the vehicles are driven by hundreds of thousands of customers every day, they are safe and roadworthy, which is why we do not believe there is any damage and therefore no reason for a lawsuit.\"\n\nIt also said that \"a settlement is hardly imaginable, since it is completely unclear who has filed which possible claims. Settlement negotiations with so many unknown factors are simply not practicable.\"\n\nFour years after the scandal broke out and after it admitted to fitting emission-cheating software of 11 million cars, the German company is still wrestling with several legal battles.\n\nLast week, chief executive Herbert Dies, supervisory board chief Hans Dieter Poetsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn were charged with market manipulation in a case opposing the company to investors.\n\nThe scandal has so far cost the carmaker $33 billion (\u20ac30.2 billion), the vast majority \u2014 $25 billion \u2014 paid to US regulators and consumers. In Germany, it has paid three fines for a total of \u20ac2.3 billion.", "description": "The Dieselgate scandal, which broke out in 2015, has so far cost the German carmaker more than \u20ac30 billion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/19/69/68/1000x563_cmsv2_7d1c26f5-a8ad-5e15-8c61-a60004277542-4196968.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
