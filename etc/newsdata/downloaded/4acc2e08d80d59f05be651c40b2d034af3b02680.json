Epstein is finishing his eighth season as the Chicago Cubs\u2018 president of baseball operations.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to the story,\u201d Epstein said Wednesday night before the Cubs played the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nEpstein oversaw Boston\u2019s baseball operations for eight seasons from 2003-10 before leaving to join the Cubs. The Red Sox won the World Series in 2004, their first title since 1918, then won again in 2007.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of great relationships with people who work for the Red Sox and I wish them the very best but there is nothing more to it,\u201d Epstein said.\n\nThe Cubs entered play Wednesday on a seven-game losing streak and nearing elimination with five games left in the season. Either one win by Milwaukee or one loss by Chicago would knock the Cubs from the NL wild-card race.\n\nManager Joe Maddon\u2019s five-year contract expires at the end of the season. Epstein declined to answer questions about Maddon\u2019s future, saying \u201cI want to leave that between Joe and I for now.\u201d\n\nMaddon led the Cubs to the postseason in each of his first four seasons, including an elusive World Series championship in 2016. That ended a 108-year title drought that stretched to 1908. His record since coming to Chicago is 449-336.\n\nMaddon said he has not discussed his status with Epstein, though he added, \u201cIt\u2019s also my decision, too,\u201d\n\nThe Cubs entered play Wednesday having outscored their opponents by 104 runs (791-6870 but had a record of 82-75.\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t correlate, and we feel like we\u2019ve left a lot on the table this season,\u201d Epstein said.\n\nAdded Maddon, \u201cWe just weren\u2019t able to get over the hump.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Theo Epstein says he has no plans of returning to the Boston Red Sox.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Perrotto"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
