He was 90.\n\nAlvarez died Monday in London of pneumonia, according to his literary representatives, Aitken Alexander Associates.\n\nWriting alternately as A. Alvarez or Al Alvarez, he had a long, productive and controversial career. He began as a highly influential critic, who as poetry editor of the Observer, was an early champion of Plath, her then-husband Ted Hughes, John Berryman and others he believed would enliven contemporary poetry. He would go on to write novels and poems and to complete nonfiction books about life \u201cbeyond the fiddle\u201d of the book world, whether rock climbing (\u201cFeeding the Rat\u201d), swimming (\u201cPondlife\u201d), the search for oil in the North Sea (\u201cOffshore\u201d) or poker (\u201cThe Biggest Game In Town\u201d).\n\n\u201cPeople were continually asking me, in so many words, what a literary guy who knew about poetry was doing in joints like these,\u201d he wrote in the memoir \u201cWhere Did It All Go Right?\u201d that was published in 1999. \u201cI went because I realized very early that I would only get one shot at the planet, so I might as well see for myself what was on offer.\u201d\n\nHis breakthrough work, published in 1971, was his most painfully personal. In \u201cThe Savage God: A Study of Suicide,\u201d he traced the history of how society looked upon suicide - from the centuries of being treated as a religious taboo, to glorification by the 19th-century Romantics to the randomness and plain despair of modern times.\n\n\u201cThe Savage God\u201d unintentionally helped launch a cottage industry in publishing: It opened with one of the first extended accounts of the final months of Plath, who in 1963 was been found dead at age 30 in her London kitchen after sealing the window and door, turning on the oven and sticking her head inside. Her death was ruled a suicide, although Alvarez would question whether Plath - who had two small children - had meant to kill herself.\n\nIn her lifetime, Plath was little known beyond fellow poets. But her fame rose through the 1960s thanks in part to the posthumous release of her \u201cAriel\u201d poems, many written in a cathartic and devouring rush after her marriage to Hughes collapsed in 1962. Alvarez was originally closer to Hughes, but spent more time with Plath after the couple separated and eventually regarded her as the greater talent.\n\nIn the book\u2019s most talked about section, Alvarez recalled Plath inviting him to her home on Christmas Eve 1962. She read to him poems from \u201cAriel,\u201d notably \u201cDeath & Co.,\u201d that left him awed and startled by her stark references to death and inescapable sense of finality. Alvarez didn\u2019t know what to tell her and departed even as, he would write, she sobbed and begged him to stay.\n\n\u201cShe must have felt I was stupid and insensitive. Which I was,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI knew I had let her down in some final and unforgiveable way. And I knew she knew. I never again saw her alive.\u201d\n\nAlvarez had wanted her to be known for her work, writing in \u201cThe Savage God\u201d that \u201cThe pity is not that there is a myth of Sylvia Plath but that the myth is not simply that of an enormously gifted poet whose death came carelessly, by mistake, and too soon.\u201d But his book and its passage about Plath\u2019s long, loosened hair and its smell \u201csharp as an animal\u2019s\u201d helped raise speculation over whether he and the poet were lovers. Alvarez addressed the rumors in the 1990s when he told Plath biographer Janet Malcolm that \u201cSylvia wasn\u2019t my style. She wasn\u2019t my physical type.\u201d In \u201cWhere Did It All Go Right?\u201d Alvarez wrote that after Hughes left, Plath needed \u201csomeone to live with and take care of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t up to her despair and it scared me,\u201d he wrote, adding that he never \u201ckidded\u201d himself that changing \u201cfrom friend to lover would have made a lot of difference to her in the end.\u201d\n\nAlvarez\u2019s memories of Plath enraged Hughes, who accused his onetime friend of betraying their privacy that led to a yearslong estrangement. In a letter to Alvarez, Hughes dismissed the critic\u2019s contention that his revelations would end speculation about Plath\u2019s death and anticipated - correctly - a \u201cwhole new world of hypothesis.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore this, the fantasies were hot air, blowing each other away as fast as they were invented, all of them perfectly weightless,\u201d Hughes wrote. \u201cBut now you have provided what seems to be substance, real fact and foundation - the story from one who was in the room.\u201d\n\nIn the 2003 film \u201cSylvia,\u201d which starred Gwyneth Paltrow as Plath and Daniel Craig as Hughes, Jared Harris played Alvarez.\n\nAt the time he knew Plath, Alvarez himself nearly ended his life. His first marriage, to Ursula Barr, was ending and he was haunted by childhood stories about his parents \u201chalf-heartedly\u201d putting their heads inside gas ovens. He became so depressed that he swallowed 45 sleeping pills and fell into a coma. He awoke days later, and would look back on the experience as a death, and a rebirth.\n\n\u201cI began gradually to stir into another style of life, less theoretical and less optimistic, less vulnerable. I was ready for an insentient middle age,\u201d he wrote in \u201cThe Savage God.\u201d\n\nAlvarez married Anne Adams in 1966 and with her had two children. He previously had a son with Barr, the granddaughter of Frieda Lawrence, who was the widow of D.H. Lawrence, a lineage Alvarez would say compelled him to propose marriage. Alvarez wrote briefly about his first wife in \u201cThe Savage God\u201d and at length in the 1982 release \u201cLife After Marriage,\u201d which Barr denounced in the London Review of Books as fiction, adding, \u201cIt is a pity he has neither the good taste, nor the talent, to present it as such.\u201d\n\nAlvarez was born in London, and as a young man he was drawn equally to adventure and contemplation, although contemplation at first won out. At Oxford\u2019s Corpus Christi College, he absorbed so much literary theory that he founded a campus discussion group called the Critical Society. He became poetry critic and editor of the Observer in 1956, but a decade later was bored of highlighting the creations of others. His epiphany, what he called his \u201croad to Damascus moment,\u201d came while reading \u201cBleak House\u201d and becoming so \u201ctotally caught up\u201d that he didn\u2019t bother to analyze it.\n\n\u201cHere I am, a paid-up, card-carrying literary critic and I\u2019ve forgotten that authors write books in order to give pleasure,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cI must have known that when I first decided that writing was what I wanted to do with my life, and if years of churning out criticism have made me forget it, then I must give up criticism and get back to where I started.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Alfred Alvarez, a critic and author with a non-literary streak who helped shape the modern poetry canon in his native England, explored everything from oil digging to poker and wrote a best-selling history of suicide bracketed by his attempt on his own life and the death of his friend Sylvia Plath, has died.
