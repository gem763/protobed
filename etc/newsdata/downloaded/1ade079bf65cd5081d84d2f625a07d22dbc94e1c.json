She is dangerous, she has to be put away for a long time.'\n\nShe said she is still haunted by the attack, but may now find comfort after getting some items of jewellery back.\n\nGurgana Gueorguieva ambushed Geraldine (pictured after the attack) at her \u00a34million Knightsbridge penthouse four years ago. She was hit over the head with a kettle and restrained her with plastic cable ties during the three-hour ordeal\n\nThese included the Victorian diamond engagement ring given to Mrs Winner by her film-maker husband, who died in 2013.\n\nShe told Hello! magazine: 'It was the loss of items of sentimental value which hurt the most.\n\n'How on earth she thought she would get away with what she did, I'll never know. I was terrified someone would come into my apartment and attack me.\n\nGueorguieva (pictured) was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in prison last month\n\n'I was too scared to be alone at night so a friend stayed in my spare room.'\n\nIt took Mrs Winner nine months of therapy to recover from the assault, which she described as 'traumatic' and 'terrible'.\n\nBut she added: 'I've got that original British backbone. I won't be beaten.'\n\nDuring her sentencing, Judge Testar suggested Gueorguiva - a personal trainer - had motives that were not purely financial.\n\nIn the run-up to the robbery she carefully researched her rival and sought to 'cause her pain through the loss of objects which were precious to her' through her association with Winner.\n\nHe said: 'Plainly the defendant blamed Mrs Winner for not receiving the inheritance she expected and she decided she would teach her a lesson.'\n\nBulgarian-born Gueorguiva dated Winner between 1999 and 2002, and he helped her obtain British citizenship.\n\nMrs Winner dated the film director, who died in January 2013, in 1957 but didn't marry him until 2011.\n\nThe full interview is available in Hello magazine, out now.", "description": "Earlier this month Geraldine Winner, 81, told how she was beaten, tied and robbed by the film director's former flame Gurgana Gueorguieva at her Knightsbridge penthouse.", "authors": ["Xantha Leatham For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/23/20259866-0-image-a-84_1572218997761.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
