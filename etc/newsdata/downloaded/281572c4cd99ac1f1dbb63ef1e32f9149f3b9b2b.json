Earlier this year I spent two or three months in south east Asia. Not Bhutan. I will be going to Bhutan in about six months.\n\nJeremy\u2019s comment could mean that the guys have headed to Bhutan for the new episodes (Picture: Amazon)\n\n\u2018Where have I been in the world? Literally everywhere is the answer to that, including Cambodia \u2013 I think on five occasions \u2013 where the official language is Khmer.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile his answer was of course incredibly helpful to Erica, the part about travelling to Bhutan six months after the episode was recorded could mean that\u2019s where he, Richard and James were headed to shoot new episodes of The Grand Tour.\n\nFilming on the new season has also taken place in both Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nThings got pretty hairy for them out in Cambodia as the crew were caught up in a catastrophic monsoon and were forced to abandon filming for their safety.\n\nmetro-tag-post-strip]\n\nJeremy explained at the time that four people had been killed just \u2018inches away\u2019 from where they were recording just days before.\n\nHe has also detailed how the presenters and producers struggled to come up with locations that would be safe to film in.\n\nIn his column for The Sunday Times, Jeremy explained they had the idea to follow in the footsteps of Lawrence of Arabia from Saudi Arabia to Cairo.\n\nHe said: \u2018This would be an epic journey, except it would mean crossing the Sinai peninsula and, thanks to Isis, the chances of us all arriving on the other side with heads were slim.\u2019\n\nHe went on that the Andaman Islands, off the coast of Thailand, was also put forward, but \u2018there\u2019s a tribe on one of these islands that will kill anyone who lands.\u2019\n\nThe Grand Tour is available to watch on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
