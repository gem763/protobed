He asked me to publish his apology #Respect.\"\n\nThe seven-minute delay did little to put the hosts off, however, as France ran out 4-1 winners.", "description": "Albania were victims of a national anthem mix-up against France on Saturday, but French president Emmanuel Macron has apologised.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Mlnq3.sIrE8Ga3o74w84bw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/9a2c4870fc30e781e682ba0719ca9d2f", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
