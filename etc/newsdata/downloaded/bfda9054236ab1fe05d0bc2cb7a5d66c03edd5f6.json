The company, based in Nashville, last had a private valuation of about $3.18 billion, according to Crunchbase, and received $380 million in total funding as a private company. SmileDirectClub is looking to raise more than $1.1 billion when it goes public.\n\nIf the company ends up pricing at the midpoint of its range, and after taking into account it\u2019s two-class share structure, its valuation as a public company would be around $7.93 billion.\n\nAs we discussed when SmileDirectClub dropped its S-1 last month, the company posted tremendous revenue growth over the past year. Its H1 2019 revenue was $373.5 million, up from $175.1 million during the same period a year ago. Its operating costs and losses are also up, but that\u2019s almost to be expected of a 2019 IPO.\n\nCloudflare, on the other hand, is expected to go public on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday with a price range of $10 to $12 per share. The San Francisco-based company raised $332.1 million in total funding as a private company and was last valued at $3.25 billion.\n\nCloudflare reported healthy revenue growth of $129.2 million in the first half of 2019, up from $87.1 million during the same period last year. It also reported net losses of $36.8 million in the first half of 2019, up from $32.5 million in the first half of 2018.\n\nWith 293 million shares outstanding when it goes public, Cloudflare would be valued at $2.9 billion and $3.5 billion. It could raise up to $420 million by selling an expected 35 million shares in its IPO.\n\nPrivate investors showed a lot of love for both of these companies while they were private, but we\u2019ll be watching this Thursday and Friday to see if the public markets return the favor.\n\nIllustration: Li-Anne Dias.", "description": "", "authors": ["Sophia Kunthara"], "top_image": "https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IPO_generic.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
