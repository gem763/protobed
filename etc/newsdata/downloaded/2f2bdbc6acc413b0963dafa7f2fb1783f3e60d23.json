Fiore purchased the house four years ago and spent two months renovating it before moving in.\n\n\u201cWe just love the place, we didn\u2019t want to sell. Everything about the house works so well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt has that character lifestyle without the compromise. It\u2019s the perfect place for modern living. We have so many good memories as a family. It is sad to leave.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so good, that the Kelly Racing driver, who will partner with co-driver Garry Jacobson in Bathurst\u2019s great race on Sunday, has little need for a car outside of work.\n\n\u201cThe house is in such a great location. It\u2019s a great suburb for walking. You can literally walk in any direction and wind up in a cafe. It\u2019s very bike friendly too. There are so many parks and it\u2019s just across the road from Beatty Park,\u201d Fiore said.\n\nIn one of North Perth\u2019s best streets, the character four-bedroom home has been tastefully renovated throughout, while maintaining the residence\u2019s best traditional features. They include: wide timber floorboards, open fireplaces, high ornate ceilings, architraves and skirtings.\n\nIts makeover has brought it a master bedroom with walk-in robe and contemporary ensuite bathroom, a modern kitchen with a large open plan family room with dining and living spaces.\n\nThe generous 558 sq m block is on a quiet, leafy street with landscaped gardens and a big backyard. It sits opposite the Redemptorist Monastery and is within walking distance of the CBD.\n\nHowever the house doesn\u2019t feature any petrolhead themes or V8 touches within.\n\n\u201cThey are two very separate parts of my life,\u201d Fiore said.\n\n\u201cMy wife is the brains behind this house. She has done it all. When we bought it, it was a bit hideous, but it\u2019s nothing like that anymore. It\u2019s been an absolute dream. We love the fireplaces and the french doors opening out into the backyard, the modern kitchen, you don\u2019t want for anything. But the family has outgrown it and it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d\n\nThe campaign for the property kicked off two weeks ago and there has been considerable interest in the property so far.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the type of home you see in a lot of commercials,\u201d agent Pam Herron said.\n\n\u201cPeople who have been through it love you fact there is nothing to do. You can just move straight in. It\u2019s a fantastic location and beautifully renovated. Demand for these character homes in the suburbs continues to be strong.\u201d\n\nFiore had plans to build a garage for tinkering on his car but that never eventuated. The car port has the potential to be transformed into a larger garage. While a pool was another option, the family never took up also.", "description": "Australian motorsport\u2019s biggest weekend of the year hasn\u2019t stopped one driver from putting his gorgeous home on the market.", "authors": ["James Macsmith"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/11170928/capi_5fa58099d5673f8a7e48663ff01a53ba_6135bb4203989c7ea1c93d8421b86619.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
