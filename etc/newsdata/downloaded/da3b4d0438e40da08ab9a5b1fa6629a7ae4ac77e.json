I felt stupid and naive,\" Jo says.\n\nImage copyright Jo Myatt Image caption Jo with her nieces\n\n\"People don't realise it can spread to other areas of the body and you can having nothing in your breast.\"\n\nJo is now on her fourth treatment and waiting anxiously for the results of her latest scans.\n\nShe knows she is eventually going to run out of options, but she urges other women to speak up.\n\n\"If you're worried about pain, make doctors aware of your history.\n\n\"You're not going mad - the sooner you find the secondary, the better health you're going to be in and the more it can be contained.\"\n\nWhat are the symptoms of secondary breast cancer?\n\nThey can vary depending on where the cancer has spread to, but common signs and symptoms include:\n\nunexpected weight loss or loss of appetite\n\ndiscomfort or swelling under the ribs or across the upper abdomen\n\nsevere or continuing headaches\n\naltered vision or speech\n\nfeeling sick most of the time\n\nbreathlessness or a dry cough\n\nloss of balance or weakness or numbness of the limbs\n\nany lumps or swellings under the arm, breastbone or collarbone\n\npain in the bones (eg back, hips or ribs) that doesn't get better with pain relief and may be worse at night\n\nCancer Research UK lists more symptoms of secondary breast cancer on its website.\n\nBreast Cancer Now's survey of 2,100 people in the UK with secondary breast cancer found that just 13% were told of the symptoms to look out for if their cancer spread.\n\nAnd four in 10 said they felt their symptoms had not been taken seriously before they were diagnosed.\n\nBreast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK, with around 55,000 new cases every year.\n\nAlthough survival rates have significantly improved over the last 40 years in the UK, there are still around 11,500 deaths from breast cancer each year - mostly from secondary breast cancer.\n\n'Working flat out'\n\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, from the Royal College of GPs, said: \"GPs and our teams are working flat out to do the very best we can for all our patients.\n\n\"We understand the importance of timely cancer diagnosis and are highly trained to identify possible symptoms of cancer and its recurrence.\"\n\nBut she said some symptoms were \"very difficult to interpret because they are vague in the initial stages\" or similar to other, more common conditions.\n\nProf Stokes-Lampard called for GPs to have better access to the right diagnostic tools and training to use them.", "description": "People should know the signs that the disease has spread to other parts of the body, says a charity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/152F9/production/_109177768_jo_myatt.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
