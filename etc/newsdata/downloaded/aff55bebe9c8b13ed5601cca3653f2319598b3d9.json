If so, then the decision not to deem the tackle a foul after a second look is questionable and highly debatable.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Sadio Mane saw a goal ruled out for handball just minutes later.\n\nThat decision was the right call, but it didn't stop Klopp being furious with events and viewers, particularly those in the stadium, being left confused by the procedures being followed.\n\n4) Big game nerves\n\nRegardless of the controversy shortly before the break, Liverpool did not look themselves in the first half.\n\nThe game started off with the typical feel of a big local derby, with both sides looking edgy and scrappy proceedings early on.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nBut, against the form book, it was United who grew into the game and looking more comfortable in possession, with Scott McTominay pulling the strings in midfield and the pressing of Andreas Pereira and Fred preventing Liverpool from settling down.\n\nUncharacteristically, the occasion seemed to get to Liverpool in the first half, and they were far from at their best.\n\nThey recovered slightly after the break, but ultimately it was United who looked spirited and energised by the occasion as Liverpool endured a rare off day.\n\n5) Is Matip the man?\n\nLiverpool handed Joel Matip a new contract this week - but is he the man to partner Virgil van Dijk moving forwards?\n\nMatip has been in fine form so far this season, yet Marcus Rashford caught him out for the opening goal.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHe faked a run to the near post before peeling to the back post and finding space away from the Liverpool defender to hit the back of the net.\n\nIt is perhaps harsh to highlight Matip after his consistency this season, but question marks remain regarding whether he is the world class centre-back the Reds will need alongside the imperious Van Dijk if they are to put together an ongoing run of dominance.\n\n6) James targeted?\n\nDaniel James looked to be targeted by Liverpool during the second half after being lively early on.\n\nThe Welsh winger - one of United's brightest sparks this season - provided a delightful assist for Rashford's opener with his pinpoint cross.\n\nBut he was clattered by Virgil van Dijk early in the second half before again taking a big collision from Fabinho just minutes later.\n\nLiverpool certainly seemed to be taking a physical approach with James, who has just been put on a special training regime at Old Trafford to improve his strength.\n\n(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)\n\nJames recently suffered a head injury for Wales but stayed on, leading to criticism from a brain injury charity.\n\nIt is an issue football has become more aware of in recent months, and he was checked over by physios for a couple of minutes before being allowed to continue.\n\nThe youngster might have made an impact in the first half, but roughing him up seemed to work. His second half impact was limited.\n\n7) Tale of two halves\n\nMost expected Liverpool to dominate possession against United, with the hosts looking for success on the counter attack with the pace of Marcus Rashford and Daniel James.\n\nIn reality, those predictions couldn't have been further from the truth in the first period.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports before the game, Jurgen Klopp predicted the Red Devils would look to rely on the counter attack, something he says they expected.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe German clearly set his side up to counter that threat. They were happy to let United have play on the front foot, whilst they struggled to get their foot on the ball.\n\nThat tactic did not work and after the break it was a different game.\n\nLiverpool upped the tempo, kept possession and United were the side happier to sit back and protect their lead.\n\nThe introduction of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had a positive impact for the visitors as super sub Lallana later popped up for a potentially vital point.\n\n8) Liverpool miss out on history\n\nLiverpool have fallen agonisingly short of making history, despite salvaging a point.\n\nA win would have seen them draw level with Manchester City's record of 18 straight Premier League victories.\n\nTheir remarkable winning run - dating back to last season - has finally come to an end.\n\nThey are back to square one and after closing in on the record, it is now out of reach.", "description": "Adam Lallana emerged as an unlikely hero for Liverpool as they snatched a point against Man Utd", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag", "Tom Purslow", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661239.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
