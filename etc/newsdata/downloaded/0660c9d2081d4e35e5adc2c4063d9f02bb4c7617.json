They read like the preamble to a statement about why she has no choice but to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. Money quote: \u201cIt is not a citizen\u2019s job to \u2018be loyal\u2019; it is the official\u2019s job to earn our loyalty. And when they cannot, we vote them out of office.\u201d\n\nIf she\u2019s getting in, though, it\u2019d be completely out of the blue. I don\u2019t recall seeing a single Fiorina rumor in political media this year.\n\nAm I wrong to read her tweets as a primary hint? Maybe I just have Sanford on the brain.\n\nOur Constitution is the document that protects those liberties and delivers that justice. \u2014 Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) September 9, 2019\n\nWhen we swear to \u201cprotect and defend\u201d the Constitution, we promise to uphold the rights, the laws and the institutions that define and govern our nation. \u2014 Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) September 9, 2019\n\nI am not alone. Many others have been intimidated into silence or compelled to defend the indefensible. \u2014 Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) September 9, 2019\n\nWe abdicate our responsibility to help create a \u201cmore perfect union.\u201d And in this country, the citizen, not the President, is sovereign. \u2014 Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) September 9, 2019\n\nAs citizens it is both our responsibility and our right to hold elected officials accountable: for their words, their actions and the consequences of both. \u2014 Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) September 9, 2019\n\nActually, as I read it again, that sounds more like the introduction to a third-party run than a primary challenge. \u201cWe have no obligation to follow party orthodoxy, whatever it is\u201d plays like a declaration of independence from the GOP, whom she\u2019s accusing of corruption by canceling next year\u2019s elections.\n\nOne thing that struck me yesterday about Sanford\u2019s candidacy is how it complements Joe Walsh\u2019s, two components in a broader argument against Trump. Sanford\u2019s covering the policy part of the argument, aiming at Trump over ballooning deficits. Walsh is focusing on the character part, highlighting ways in which Trump is temperamentally unfit. An obvious missing piece in the argument, though, is women: POTUS polls remarkably, even dangerously, poorly among them, he\u2019s facing #MeToo claims of various stripes, and yet the three candidates who\u2019ve jumped in to oppose him in the primaries are all men.\n\nMaybe Fiorina sees an opening as a female voice speaking out against Trump, especially as a third-party candidate:\n\nIn the NBC/WSJ poll, 40% will definitely/probably vote for Trump and 52% definitely/probably for a Dem. Among whites: White women/college+\n\nTrump 30%\n\nDem 63% White women/non-college\n\nTrump 43%\n\nDem 49% White men/ college+\n\nTrump 44%\n\nDem 49% White men/non-college\n\nTrump 67%\n\nDem 22% \u2014 Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) August 19, 2019\n\nThose are some mind-boggling gender gaps among white voters. White male college grads are net -5 on Trump while white female college grads are \u2026 -33. Among Trump\u2019s core base of whites without a college degree, he\u2019s +45 with men and -6 among women. No joke \u2014 a 51-point gap. Nor is this the only poll this summer showing abysmal numbers for him among women. Back in June, The Hill found that 62 percent of women said they were unlikely to vote for POTUS in 2020.\n\nMaybe Fiorina\u2019s reading that data and thinking there\u2019s room for a pro-business center-right woman critic of Trump as an independent candidate next year. Trump\u2019s campaign is desperate to improve his standing with suburban women, the same group that killed the GOP in House elections last fall and nearly handed a Senate seat in Texas to Beto O\u2019Rourke. That\u2019s exactly whom Fiorina would pitch herself to \u2014 better-educated white women, just like herself, who find Trump personally obnoxious but also don\u2019t want to end up as piggy banks for President Warren\u2019s social engineering program. Whether Fiorina would pull more votes from Trump or from his opponent if she ran third-party is unclear, but she\u2019s been eager to make a splash in politics for years with little success. A campaign aimed at suburban women would make her a factor in 2020, particularly if she lines up some real money. Trump would need to be careful in how he attacks her too; no doubt some of his choicer lines about women generally and Fiorina in particular will be featured in her attacks against him.\n\nEven if she\u2019s only a three-percent candidate backed by centrists who loathe both nominees, that\u2019s an important three percent.\n\nExit question: Am I reading too much into her tweets? She has nothing to lose by running as an independent (certainly there\u2019s no future for a Fiorina-type candidate in the post-Trump GOP), she can potentially have an impact, and she\u2019d fill an interesting niche as the only prominent woman candidate if Democrats end up nominating Biden or Bernie.
