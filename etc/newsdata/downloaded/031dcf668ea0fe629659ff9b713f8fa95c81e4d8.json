Those talks were already overshadowed by a U.S. decision to place Chinese firms it believed were complicit in the repression of Uighurs on an export blacklist on Monday.\n\nLast week, the manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team Daryl Morey tweeted in support of Hong-Kong pro-democracy protesters. The Chinese Basketball Association promptly suspended all cooperation with the Rockets, and Morey retracted his tweet, saying that he didn\u2019t mean to offend Chinese supporters and adding that he\u2019s \u201chad a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\nMorey and other NBA officials were widely criticized for apologetic statements intended to assuage Chinese anger. The comedy series South Park subsequently aired an episode mocking Chinese censorship, after which China removed all episodes of the TV show from television and streaming services within the country.\n\nOn Wednesday it was reported that fans of the Philadelphia 76ers were ejected from a preseason game with a Chinese team after the fans held up signs saying \u201cFree Hong Kong.\u201d Security at the arena reportedly told the fans to avoid making political statements.\n\nChina also criticized Apple on Wednesday after the company approved an app that allows protesters to track police. The app represents concentrations of police with the emoji of a dog, an insult widely hurled at police by protesters in Hong Kong.", "description": "Mike Pompeo announced visa restrictions on Chinese officials believed to participate in the repression of the Uighur, Kazakh, and other Muslim minorities.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Kevin D.
