Now, we\u2019re going behind the scenes at Lifehacker. I\u2019m Heather Hass, and this is how I work.\n\nLocation: Ridgewood, Queens\n\nCurrent gig: Creative Producer for Lifehacker\n\nCurrent computer: iMac\n\nCurrent mobile device: iPhone\n\nFirst of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today.\n\nWell, in my current background Abu is sitting and on his computer. How I got here today: I started the day snuggling my cute family and making them apple cinnamon crepes. After kissing my fianc\u00e9 and 3 year old Sawyer goodbye, I walked my 6 year old Theodor to school. Walked to L, switched to the NQRW, and finally, plowed through the super heroes and CD sellers and several Starbucks of Times Square \u2014 to the office of G/O media.\n\nScreenshot: Heather Hass\n\nWhat are your job responsibilities?\n\nI edit videos for Lifehacker, sometimes I get to animate, too!\n\nBesides your phone, what apps, gadgets, or tools can\u2019t you live without?\n\nI would be real sad with out pencils and paper.\n\nWhat\u2019s your workspace setup like?\n\nIt always looks Dennis Nedry\u2019s desk.\n\nScreenshot: Amblin Entertainment\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite shortcut or hack?\n\nI have a real great way to cut my veggies when I eat sandwiches.\n\nIllustration: Heather Hass\n\nWho are the people who help you get things done, and how do you rely on them?\n\nEveryone at LH is great, but I most closely work with Joel and Abu! We\u2019re always bouncing ideas off of each other, and its always good to show a video cut or brainstorm with them the best way to do something.\n\nFor my passion projects, I have a very talented crew of friends who feel like family back in Milwaukee. They\u2019re full of great ideas and always willing to try my crazy ones. Lucky me!\n\nHow do you recharge or take a break?\n\nI\u2019ll sometimes wander around the office and talk to the people from the other verticals, see if anyones working on anything cool or has anything fun going on. Or grabbing whatever snacks are around.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite side project?\n\nI\u2019m always working on a music video, hoping to finish one very soon! Lots of stop motion and spfx. It has been very satisfying to work on something so creative, when I have the energy!\n\nPhoto: Heather Hass\n\nWhat are you currently reading, or what do you recommend?\n\nYou should probably read this by my very talented fianc\u00e9, Sean Williamson.\n\nCan you share a music playlist you\u2019ve made, whether for working or elsewhere?\n\nEveryone should go listen to this album that just came out by some of my very favourite people.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\nWork smart, not hard.\n\nWhat\u2019s a problem you\u2019re still trying to solve?\n\nHaving more time, energy, money, and space. And drinking my coffee in the morning before it gets too cold.", "description": "Every week, we share the shortcuts, workspaces and productivity tips of our favourite experts.
