He shared this discovery on Twitter, post which the websites were taken down. Even the misleading URL is now defunct.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f NSFW \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n1. During an investigation I found the website https://t.co/DCTpwkh7jw. An #Aadhaar related website? Not at all! This is a porn website. \u2014 Elliot Alderson (@fs0c131y) October 23, 2019\n\nWhat's odd is the fact that this link has been present on the official website of the Directorate of Education, Government of Goa for a while now. In fact, with the help of Wayback Machine, an internet archive, the link has been on it since February this year. How come no one spotted this and rectified it then?\n\nThe website for Goa government was completely revamped this year, with a ton of inclusion such as the Digital India ticker that was not present on the previous iteration of the website.\n\nThere is no official statement by the Goa government as of now. We also don't know by when would these sites be back online.\n\nThis year, the official website of BJP (Bhartiya Janta Party) website was also defaced by hackers, leaving behind a series of defamatory and insulting messages about PM Narendra Modi and his followers and supporters. The site was taken down then and launched back in a few days as if nothing happened.", "description": "The official website for the Directorate of Education and Directorate of Official Language has been pulled down after the site was discovered redirecting its visitors to an external website that flashed pornographic content.
