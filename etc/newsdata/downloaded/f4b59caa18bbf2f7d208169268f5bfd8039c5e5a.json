It needs only two old-school things to accomplish this: a pen and a paper.\n\nRecently, Cryptonews.com wrote about the Bitcoin-bullish report published by German bank Bayern LB. We\u2019ve had a chance to talk with the author of the September 2019 report, Senior Economist and FX Analyst in the research team of Bayern LB, Manuel Andersch.\n\nAndersch told us that \u201c\u2019crypto\u2019 is a rather meaningless word\u201d to the Economic Research Department (which is the part of the bank looking into BTC), as the Department is exclusively interested in Bitcoin as an alternative monetary system, but also in the products and additional layers that are built on top of BTC as the base layer, such as the Lightning Network.\n\n\u201cThere is a constant interest on the client side to learn more about Bitcoin,\u201d the economist told us. These are the bank\u2019s corporate and institutional clients that want to learn the basics of Bitcoin. This interest prompted the research team to create \u201ca very newbie-friendly workshop,\u201d aimed both at newcomers and those who want to expand their theoretical knowledge with an intuitive and practical experience,\u201d the analyst said. Interestingly, the format of the interactive workshop, aptly called 'The Bitcoin Experience,\u2019 allows for \u201ca mixture of explanations and interactive simulation of the Bitcoin network\u201d to be used in order to explain to the newcomers the basic functionality of Bitcoin \u2013 with pen and paper only.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always fun and it has helped many to understand the basic underpinnings of Bitcoin,\u201d says Andersch, further explaining how the workshop actually works. The participants perform proof of work mining, with prime factorization as the \u201cwork,\u201d and they create a blockchain with pieces of paper that relate to each other. They are also faced with a challenge on how to find a consensus about the state of this database in a decentralized network of participants (where nodes are bar tables). \u201cIn order to illustrate the economic incentives of the Bitcoin system, there are also mining rewards,\u201d says Andersch.\n\nPieces of papers with A-Z letters on it are used as transactions, and these circulate in the room for the nodes to validate them according to established rules based on colors. In order to make a calculation for the proof of work, the participants map from letters to numbers based on the number of the letter in the alphabet (e.g. A = 1, G = 7). After five transactions, a block is full and \u201cevery node can start with the proof of work puzzle, in order to be THE node that can present its block as the new valid block to rest of the network.\u201d\n\nAndersch explains that the proof of work task is simply to perform prime factorization to the sum of the transactions (if it is not the genesis block to the sum of the transactions plus some number from the previous block). Smartphones are not really allowed when calculating the prime factors.\n\n\u201cThe nice thing is that you can explain a lot using prime factorization,\u201d the economist says, such as:\n\nDifficulty adjustment (simply making the number a participant has to factorize larger)\n\nASIC miners and their implications (smartphones are allowed at this point)\n\nIt is \u201cuncomfortable\u201d enough to show the cost side\n\nAs all calculations are linked to previous block\u2019s calculations, participants quickly understand that changing something implies huge costs (a participant would have to do all the prime factorizations again).\n\n\u201cSince all the other nodes verify the calculations, everybody also gets that cheating is not paying off and that the only way to get the reward is to \u2018to do the work\u2019,\u201d Andersch says.\n\nIn regards to the feedback, he says that it\u2019s very positive and that most people like the workshop. If people are interested in the workshop, he\u2019s the one to contact, he tells us, adding \u2018We usually have a 30 minutes sessions after the \u2018simulation\u2019 to put everything into perspective of the \u2018real Bitcoin world\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe team is connected with the vibrant Bitcoin scene in Munich, and they\u2019ve hosted this year\u2019s Value of Bitcoin Conference with Fidelity Digital Assets at the Bank, which was also well received by their clients, Andersch tells us.\n\nMeanwhile, Bayern LB\u2019s Research Department offers only educational BTC-related services for now, but more operational use cases such as Bitcoin custodial services are being explored (by the Department, not the bank as a whole), particularly as banks have three advantages when it comes to BTC custody: reputation and trust, IT security knowledge, and physical vaults for backups. \u201cI think the race regarding Bitcoin custody services is on in Europe,\u201d Andersch says. \u201cThe first business that can hire the best cryptographers and establish a good reputation will have a huge first mover advantage.\u201d", "description": "One German bank has an original way to teach its clients about the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC).
