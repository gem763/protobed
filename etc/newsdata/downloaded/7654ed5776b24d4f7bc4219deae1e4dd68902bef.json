Federal land can serve a wide variety of purposes, from development of natural resources to preservation, and much of it is open to the public for recreation and enjoyment.\n\nOf course, the federal government does not have an equal footprint in each state. In some states, less than 1% of land is federally owned and managed, while in others, Uncle Sam owns well over half of all land.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the Congressional Research Service\u2019s March 2017 report \u201cFederal Land Ownership: Overview and Data\u201d to identify how much land the federal government owns in every state. Federal lands are largely concentrated in the West, with only about 4% of federal land east of the Mississippi River. Data on the federal government employment as a share of total employment by state are from the Current Employment Statistics program of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are as of 2018.\n\nFederal land is primarily controlled by five agencies: the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and the Department of Defense. Nationwide, the BLM controls by far the most land, at 248.3 million acres \u2013 nearly all of which are in western states and Alaska.\n\nWhile it is far from the largest federal land holder \u2013 controlling about 80 million acres \u2013 the National Park Service manages the lands many Americans are most likely to be familiar with. The NPS ensures the preservation of 61 national parks and hundreds of other natural and historic attractions in the United States for the enjoyment of the public.\n\nStay prepared:3 retirement expenses you may not be planning for\n\n50.
