With his side looking as if they were about to slip to another wretched defeat, a comical mix up in the Watford defence allowed Dele Alli to steal in for a late, late equaliser. Inevitably it was a goal delayed when VAR intervened to ramp up the tension. But when it was eventually given, for a moment at least, it quelled the sound of knives being sharpened in the Tottenham boardroom.\n\nBecause, that moment of good fortune aside, this was a performance by Tottenham which suggested that none of the issues that have plagued their opening to the season had been rectified. Stolid, unimaginative, lacking in drive or expertise, this was as poor as showing as the new Tottenham Stadium can have witnessed.\n\nIndeed when the architects boasted their new edifice had the best sound projection in the world, the noise they had not imagined echoing round the place was that of dissent. But at half time the boos rang loud. And no wonder. Tottenham had been for 45 minutes aimless, thoughtless and fruitless.\n\nFor a side in a rut, the fixture list could not have served up kinder opponents. Watford, a team which before this game, had dismissed as many managers this season as they had gained away points, were surely there for the taking. Instead they were a goal up within five minutes. Daryl Janmaat strolled down the right wing meeting no resistance, and, perhaps surprised by the ease of his advance, he crossed smartly into the area. As the damp paper bag of Spurs defence stood and admired the trajectory of the cross, Abdoulaye Doucoure side footed the ball past Paulo Gazzaniga.", "description": "The one thing that does not seem to have deserted Mauricio Pochettino as his team falters and stumbles is a spot of luck.", "authors": ["Jim White"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213503079-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZ2mfFK2mHBe1s9vudcKEV-W1GJ_Kr4hgBEv_2gKGJsM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
