The murderer and serial rapist also killed his three children in the blast. No U.S. service member was hurt.\n\nWe have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi! pic.twitter.com/PDMx9nZWvw \u2014 Donald J.

His two wives were also killed during the raid.\n\n\"[Al-Baghdadi] died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way. The compound had been cleared by this time with people either surrendering or being shot and killed. Eleven young children were moved out of the house and are uninjured,\" Trump said. \"The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel and he had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast.\"", "description": ".10/28/2019 20:16:33PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/290/846d8cdc-0c91-4212-8ad1-f94c2a5ba8bb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
