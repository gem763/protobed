It has allowed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to redeploy his forces to an area that had been beyond his control for years in the more than eight-year Syrian war.\n\nSyrian troops accompanied by Russian forces entered the city of Kobani, a strategically important border city and a potential flashpoint for a wider conflict, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the Syrian war, reported.\n\nSpeaking to reporters as he met Italian President Sergio Mattarella and then at a joint news conference, Trump said the Kurds were \"not angels\" and that it might be necessary for Russian-backed Syria and Turkey to \"fight it out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFIGHT FOR LAND\n\n\"Our soldiers are not in harm's way - as they shouldn't be, as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us,\" Trump said during Oval Office talks with Mattarella where he sounded as if he were washing his hands of the conflict.\n\nHe also defended his move to get U.S. troops out as part of his wider effort to bring Americans home from \"endless wars,\" despite being excoriated by members of his own Republican Party. U.S officials say, however, that those troops were expected to be repositioned in the region. Some of them could go to Iraq.\n\n\"I viewed the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be for the United States strategically brilliant,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Syria may have some help with Russia, and that's fine. It's a lot of sand,\" he later said. \"So you have Syria and you have Turkey. They're going to argue it out, maybe they're going to fight it out. But our men aren't going to get killed over it.\"\n\nActing last week after a phone call on Oct. 6 with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Trump abruptly upended five years of U.S. policy with his decision to withhold protection from Syria's Kurds and to withdraw first about 50 special operations forces and then the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops in northern Syria.\n\n\"This is a mistake worse than what (Barack) Obama did\" when the former president withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, Republican U.S. Senator Lindsay Graham, usually among Trump's strongest supporters, told reporters.\n\nThe White House, fighting the domestic political damage and perhaps trying to demonstrate the president's efforts to stop Turkey's onslaught, released an Oct. 9 Trump letter to Erdogan that said: \"Don't be a tough guy\" and \"Don't be a fool!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSANCTIONS\n\nWashington announced sanctions on Monday to punish Turkey, but Trump's critics said the steps, mainly a steel tariffs hike and a pause in trade talks, were too feeble to have an impact.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said sanctions included the entire ministries of energy and defense and could be broadened to others. Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives also plan to introduce sanctions legislation.\n\nTrump dispatched some of his top aides, including Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Turkey for emergency talks to try to persuade Ankara to halt its assault. Trump said he thought Pence and Erdogan would have a \"successful meeting\" with Erdogan, saying if they did not, U.S. sanctions and tariffs \"will be devastating to Turkey's economy.\"\n\nErdogan's spokesman said Turkey's Foreign Ministry was preparing retaliation for U.S. sanctions.", "description": "Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces before a Turkish  offensive into northern Syria last week has shattered the relative calm there and he has been accused of abandoning Kurdish militia who helped the United States fight Islamic State militants in the region.
