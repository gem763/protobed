So the sort of leadership that they have been providing in the past months will continue.\"Protests over a hike in metro fares spun out of control earlier this month,\u2026 prompting President Pinera to pledge sweeping social and economic reforms, a crackdown on widespread corruption and cabinet shakeup.Riots, arson and protests over the past couple of weeks have left at least 18 dead, led to seven-thousand arrests and business losses of around 1.4-billion U.S. dollars.Won Jung-hwan, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
