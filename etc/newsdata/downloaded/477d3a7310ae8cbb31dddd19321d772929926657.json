Nor is it, say, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer\u2019s place to preemptively accept blanket apologies from anyone who may have harmed a particular group. But this is where we are \u2014 which is to say, not anywhere particularly good. And I can\u2019t help but think about the Trudeau photos, and the revelation that he also wore blackface in high school while singing Harry Belafonte\u2019s \u201cDay-O (The Banana Boat Song).\u201d (Another video has since surfaced of Trudeau also in blackface.)\n\nEvery Halloween, we experience a flare-up of a specific truth: White people get to play with race. They get to move in and out of race, molding it like fresh play dough for their purposes. It\u2019s a benefit of white privilege to do so in circumstances where no one will shame you for it \u2014 such as at a private school. But it\u2019s tied to a history of white supremacy.\n\nWhite supremacy and racist mockery have been connected for a long time. It is no coincidence that the rise of Jim Crow laws and the spread of minstrel shows happened simultaneously. (\u201cJump Jim Crow\u201d was an early minstrel song.) As institutions did everything they could to make the lives of black people untenable and unlivable, a culture developed to make those lives a joke, extending the reach of the state into the language of daily life. What they could not destabilize by act and deed, they undermined by mockery. In Canada, blackface ran as rampant and as recent as it did in the United States, as the writer Bashir Mohamed has documented in the prairie provinces and the academic Cheryl Thompson is uncovering.\n\nBrownface, (or Orientalism, to give it its proper name) and \u201cplaying Native\u201d are indelibly connected to and built into that history. The \u201ccomical\u201d subjugation of a people can rarely be separated from efforts at their material deprivation.\n\nAnd the joke is on us. After these revelations, Canada\u2019s party leaders \u2014 excluding National Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh \u2014 are bound to point accusingly at one another like an overly formal Spider-Man meme. The Quebec nationalist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u2026 well, let\u2019s just say that\u2019s part of their job. Maxime Bernier\u2019s People\u2019s Party of Canada, which ought to be ignored, will try to minimize the harms of racism. Singh will be pulled into a conversation on race that has been the subtext of his tenure and is now making itself text. He will perform admirably, showing grace where none is required. It is as predictable as it is meaningless.\n\nBy all accounts, none of the white party leaders are avowed racists (except Bernier, who dabbles). But that\u2019s not the actual standard for political power. It\u2019s not about who has or hasn\u2019t used racial slurs, but about who can and will govern in direct opposition to racism. It\u2019s a relatively new standard in Canadian politics \u2014 but it applies.\n\nThere\u2019s another story in this, too. Elections are invasive times; we peer into the lives of our potential elected representatives. There are few boundaries, and what few there are, we trust our media to evaluate. Yet, a U.S. publication scooped the country\u2019s media. And it did so in the fourth election that Trudeau has stood for \u2014 the second in which he has been party leader. Canada\u2019s media, like its other institutions, should reflect on its willingness to take race seriously.\n\nWhat was missing was a fuller picture \u2014 beyond that frankly alarming photo \u2014 of who Trudeau was, and who he became. Like his feminism, his feelings on race were assumed more than investigated. The journalists \u2014 mostly white \u2014 who missed the story are not ideally placed to explain it now.\n\nNo doubt, the Liberals have over-promised in rhetoric and under-delivered on specific promises. Trudeau has responded with smugness when called to task on his personal failings. But under Scheer, the Conservatives have dabbled in falsehoods about refugees and the Global Compact for Migration, obviously anti-black messaging about refugees, and standing side-by-side with our own nascent racist \u201cyellow vest\u201d movement. All of those give me pause. Neither of the front-running party leaders is untainted.\n\nStill, the racist thing is racist. That is not up for debate, though it will be debated. But racism \u2014 and indeed homophobia and misogyny \u2014 are hardly political levers to be pushed and pulled at will. Whatever points are being won or lost are being marked on the lives of people who most need a government that will defend and support their racialized lives.\n\nWhite people get to play with race as if it is a game. For those whose lives are pieces on the game board, I feel nothing but a deep sense of resignation.\n\nRead more:\n\nHenry Olsen: Canada\u2019s left should dump Justin Trudeau\n\nDavid Moscrop: What are Canada\u2019s elections about?
