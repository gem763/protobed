It was a lucrative position, too, with Hunter reportedly earning millions of dollars. At the time, Vice President Biden reportedly tried to get the prosecutor in charge of the investigation fired. He's also claimed that he has \"never spoken\" to his son about his overseas business dealings. But the above photo makes that hard to believe.\n\n\u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\u201d Biden told Fox News last month. \u201cI know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader. You should be looking at Trump.\u201d\n\nWhile the whistleblower complaint against President Trump raised concerns about his asking a foreign leader to interfere in our elections and investigate Biden, it simultaneously raised questions about Biden's shady Ukraine ties. Both sides have jumped on the scandal. Democrats used it to launch an impeachment inquiry, and Republicans have cut a new ad accusing Biden of quid pro quo. The committee gave him a new nickname, \"Quid Pro Joe.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/01/2019 11:14:20AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/d1719d6f-a023-414c-929f-0fd8bd0af22e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
