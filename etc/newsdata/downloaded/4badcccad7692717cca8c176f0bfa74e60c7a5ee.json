This framework is the fundamental basis for governance in Northern Ireland and protecting it is the highest priority for all.\u201d\n\nALL-IRELAND REGULATORY ZONE\n\n\u201cIt provides for the potential creation of an all-island regulatory zone on the island of Ireland, covering all goods and agrifood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis zone would eliminate all regulatory checks for trade in goods between Northern Ireland and Ireland by ensuring that good regulations in Northern Ireland are the same as those in the rest of the EU.\u201d\n\nCONSENT\n\n\u201cThis regulatory zone must depend on the consent of those affected by it. This is essential to the acceptability of arrangements under which part of the UK accepts the rules of a different political entity.\u201d\n\nThe Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly should have the opportunity to endorse the arrangements during the transition period and every four years afterwards.\n\nUK CUSTOMS TERRITORY\n\nAfter the end of the transition Brexit period, Northern Ireland will be fully part of the UK customs territory, not the EU Customs Union.\n\nThe UK will leave the EU customs union at the end of the transition period.\n\n\u201cWe must do so whole and entire. Control of trade policy is fundamental to out future vision.\u201d\n\nCOMPLIANCE FOR GOODS\n\nAfter the transition period, which lasts until the end of 2020, Northern Ireland would align with EU rules on agri-food goods and manufactured goods.\n\nAgri-food goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would do so via a border inspection post or designated point of entry and would be subject to identity and documentary checks and physical examination by UK authorities as required by EU rules.\n\nAs a result, regulatory checks and controls would not be needed when goods enter Ireland from Northern Ireland.\n\nBritain said it would not apply corresponding checks or controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from Ireland.\n\nCUSTOMS\n\nAfter the transition period, the UK and EU will operate separate customs territories so the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will be a customs border.\n\nBritain, however, said customs checks and controls will not need to take place at, or even near, that border.\n\nAll goods movements between Northern Ireland and Ireland will be notified using a declaration.\n\nPhysical checks on a very small proportion of movements could take place at traders\u2019 premises or designated locations anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland.\n\nThe arrangements will be supported by measures such as a trusted-trader scheme, simplified customs procedures and temporary admissions, Britain said.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled what he said would be his final offer to the European Union for an amended Brexit deal, warning that if the proposals are not accepted Britain will leave the bloc at the end of the month without a divorce deal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
