The NHS says: 'If you're pregnant, limit the amount of caffeine you have to 200 milligrams (mg) a day. This is about the same as two mugs of instant coffee. 'High levels of caffeine in pregnancy can result in babies having a low birthweight, which can increase the risk of health problems in later life. Too much caffeine can also cause a miscarriage.' In a day, you will almost reach your 200mg caffeine limit if you have either two mugs of tea, one can of cola, one mug of instant coffee, or one can (250ml) of energy drink. The amount of caffeine found in some foods and drinks is as follows: One mug of instant coffee: 100mg\n\nOne mug of filter coffee: 140mg\n\nOne mug of tea: 75mg\n\nOne can of cola: 40mg\n\nOne can (250ml) of energy drink: up to 80mg \u2013 larger cans may contain up to 160mg\n\nOne bar (50g) of plain chocolate: most products on the UK market contain less than 25mg\n\nOne bar (50g) of milk chocolate: most products on the UK market contain less than 10mg\n\nThe abstract said: 'Adjustment for nausea and vomiting and other factors that change during early pregnancy showed caffeinated beverage intake at levels lower than those corresponding to medical recommendation was positively associated with risk of loss.'\n\nThe researchers did not explain why the link exists, however the effects of caffeine on the body are well understood.\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and can increase blood pressure and heart rate, both of which are not recommended during pregnancy.\n\nNHS guidelines recommend pregnant women don't drink more than 200mg of caffeine per day \u2013 about two cups of instant coffee and one cup of filtered coffee.\n\nToo much caffeine could cause a low birth weight which can lead to health problems later in life. It could also cause a miscarriage, the NHS states.\n\nHugh Taylor, vice-president of the ASRM, said: 'The data on caffeine intake and pregnancy remains somewhat inconclusive.\n\n'However, it is hard to see any harm that could come to women or babies from reducing or eliminating caffeine.'\n\nYing Cheong, professor of reproductive medicine at University of Southampton, said there was limitations to the study.\n\nShe said: 'The study wasn't designed to look at caffeine. The caffeine intake was self reported on questionnaires.\n\n'I don't think that advice is warranted based on this abstract, which has not yet been published or peer-reviewed.\n\n'The ingrained coffee culture in today's society would need many more robust studies to change.'\n\nThe study adds to a significant body of controversial literature around caffeine.\n\nIn 2008, two studies on the effects of caffeine related to miscarriage showed contrasting outcomes.\n\nExperts at the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research found women who consumed 200mg or more of caffeine daily were twice as likely to have a miscarriage as those who do not consume any caffeine, according to the paper in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\nThe other, by Nationwide Children's Hospital and released by Epidemiology, said there was no increased risk in women who drank a minimal amount of coffee daily - between 200-350mg per day.\n\nGeeta Nargund, medical director of Create Fertility Clinics and an NHS consultant, told The Times: 'This is the first study I've seen giving such stringent advice. It is an interesting and good study, but we do need further studies.'", "description": "Scientists at the US National Institutes of Health said even low levels of caffeine were a risk before and during pregnancy after analysing data from 1,228 women.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/08/19680532-0-image-a-3_1571038727216.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
