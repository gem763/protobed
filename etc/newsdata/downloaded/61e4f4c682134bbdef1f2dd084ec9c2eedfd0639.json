It is a place for the exchange of arguments and ideas \u2014 literally, a place where people talk. A national parliament grants the government permission to impose taxes and to spend revenue collected. A parliament makes laws. It is a place where elected representatives of the people hold a government to account. And a parliament embodies the political and cultural identity of the nation.\n\nThe European Parliament aspires to all of these purposes \u2014 yet precisely because it is not a national parliament, it has been handicapped in its pursuit.\n\nSome of the handicaps are logistical. From the beginning, the Parliament\u2019s resources have been divided physically between Strasbourg, Brussels and Luxembourg. It is also a multinational body that operates in several languages: At the outset it had representatives from six states and used four languages; by 1995 it had 15 states and 11 languages; now it counts 28 states and 24 languages.\n\nMore fundamentally, the EU\u2019s founding fathers, Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet, were careful in their construction of European institutions not to create obvious rivals to the legitimacy of national governments and did not follow the traditional separation of powers that had been articulated by Montesquieu in the 18th century.\n\nInsofar as there is an EU executive government, it is a compound creation, comprising elements of the European Commission; the Council of the European Union, where national ministers meet; and the European Council of national leaders.\n\nThe \u201clegislature\u201d too is a compound of the Council of the EU, the Parliament and the Commission. Since 1979, when direct elections to the European Parliament were introduced, MEPs can reasonably claim to represent voters \u2014 but the governments gathered in the Council of the EU can also lay claim to a democratic mandate from their respective national elections. So whose claim is more authentic and who holds whom to account?\n\nYet, despite these handicaps and the reticence of the founding fathers, the Parliament has over the years edged closer toward what one might expect of a national parliament.\n\nThe institution is now a lawmaking parliament, its powers progressively strengthened over the years by the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Lisbon treaties (1992, 1997, 2009). Where once its role was merely to advise and be consulted, now it is a decision-maker \u2014 jointly with the Council of the EU \u2014 on most areas of policymaking.\n\nThe Parliament has power too over the annual budget and the EU\u2019s long-term, seven-year budget. It even has some limited decision-making powers over indirect taxation.\n\nThe Parliament\u2019s powers are partly the result of treaty changes, but also the result of having exercised them \u2014 staring down the other EU institutions and winning.\n\nIt has also gained powers over political appointments. The institution elects the president of the European Commission, and its consent is needed to confirm the composition of the College of European Commissioners. Once appointed, the Commission is, as the Lisbon Treaty puts it, \u201cresponsible to the Parliament,\u201d which can in extremis censure the Commission.\n\nThe Parliament\u2019s powers are partly the result of treaty changes, but also the result of having exercised them \u2014 staring down the other EU institutions and winning.\n\nIn 1979, for instance, the first cohort of directly elected MEPs refused to approve the EU\u2019s annual budget, putting its finances onto an emergency footing. In 1999, the Parliament forced the early resignation of then Commission President Jacques Santer\u2019s administration. Later that year, when a new Commission was being appointed, the Parliament held hearings to assess the candidates for the various portfolios.\n\nThere were similar contests in lawmaking, each of which buttressed the Parliament\u2019s credibility. Notable examples are the rejection of the takeover directive, which set out rules for European mergers and acquisitions, in 2001; the rewriting of the services directive, the law underpinning the EU\u2019s single market, in 2004-2006; and the refusal to ratify ACTA, an international treaty on anti-counterfeiting, in 2012.\n\nIf the Parliament has acquired and exercised power in increasingly obvious ways over the years, it is much more difficult to pinpoint when the body established itself as a place of political theater and the stage where the EU\u2019s conflicts are acted out.\n\nThe world\u2019s media, whether traditional broadcasters and newspapers or newer, digitally savvy publishers, now regularly use the discussions in Parliament to illustrate Europe\u2019s big political arguments.\n\nTake what happened in September last year, when the issue of how to sanction breaches in the rule of law took center stage at a Parliament debate in the presence of Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. MEPs denounced Orb\u00e1n\u2019s anti-democratic behavior \u2014 his attacks on the media, the judiciary and Central European University.\n\nWhat has changed in recent years is that the drama is no longer accidental or unpredictable. It's expected \u2014 part of the process. Parliament articulates Europe's differences for all to see.\n\nIn April, Parliament again became an airing ground for grievances \u2014 this time over a lack of progress in negotiations ahead of Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc, as MEPs lamented the paralysis in the British parliament in the presence of European Council President Donald Tusk, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier.\n\nThe debate encapsulated frustrations on both sides, as Nigel Farage, a British MEP who had campaigned for Brexit, sparred with the leaders of pro-European political groups.\n\nWhat had happened behind closed doors between negotiators and national leaders at the European Council the previous week \u2014 glimpsed perhaps through Twitter and the occasional long-range camera shot \u2014 was reenacted on the Parliament\u2019s much more public stage.\n\nThe Parliament has always had its moments of drama. In 1988, Ian Paisley, a Presbyterian minister from Northern Ireland, interrupted a speech by Pope Jean Paul II to declare him the anti-Christ. In 2003, Silvio Berlusconi, then Italy\u2019s prime minister, likened Martin Schulz, the German Socialist MEP who would go on to become Parliament president, to a Nazi concentration camp guard.\n\nWhat has changed in recent years is that the drama is no longer accidental or unpredictable. It\u2019s expected \u2014 part of the process. Parliament articulates Europe\u2019s differences for all to see.\n\nIn part, this shift is the result of a collusion between the heads of the European Commission and the European Council. Both Juncker and his predecessor Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso agreed to submit their policy programs to the Parliament for scrutiny and sought the attention of Parliament for set-piece occasions like the annual State of the Union address.\n\nThe president of the European Council is bound by the EU treaties to report to the Parliament after each EU summit. The introduction of a full-time president of the European Council (first, Herman Van Rompuy in 2009, then Tusk) and the greater frequency of such summits gave these parliamentary occasions a more consistent, predictable quality.\n\nA separate but essential development was the growth of opposition to the European project within the Parliament. The number of Euroskeptic and national sovereigntist MEPs grew in the late 1990s and was reinforced by the EU\u2019s enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe in 2004.\n\nThe \u201cplace where people talk\u201d has found a wider audience. But there\u2019s nothing inevitable about the Parliament\u2019s place at the center of EU debate.\n\nThen came a succession of existential crises that shook the EU. The credit crunch and banking crisis morphed into a wider eurozone crisis, during which it seemed that Greece (and others) might fall out of the EU\u2019s single currency. That was followed by the migration crisis, which at its peak in the summer of 2015 looked as if it might topple the German chancellor and split the EU. The bloc has since been caught up in the Brexit crisis.\n\nA common feature of these crises is that they blurred the boundaries between national politics and European politics. For months on end, what was going on in the EU was desperately important to each individual country \u2014 whether the eurozone survived, whether border-free travel in the Schengen zone continued, whether far-right, anti-immigrant parties would get an electoral boost from the disagreements over migration policy.\n\nAnd news editors found that the European Parliament encapsulated the disputes that were threatening the EU\u2019s future. Sound bites from the parliamentary chamber served to illustrate a wider story.\n\nThe \u201cplace where people talk\u201d has found a wider audience. But there\u2019s nothing inevitable about the Parliament\u2019s place at the center of EU debate. If the next generations of MEPs play their hands badly, attention could easily shift elsewhere.\n\nTim King is a freelance journalist based in Brussels whose observation of the European Parliament is now entering its 10th term.", "description": "The institution has established itself as the stage where the EU\u2019s conflicts are acted out.", "authors": ["Tim King"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Option5-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-08"}
