The two are miles apart when it comes to the wealth of the clubs and their supporters. Roosters fans live in some of the richest suburbs of Australia while Canberra supporters are more Queanbeyan than Kingston.\n\nThe Raiders have enjoyed the fervent local support and their \"Viking horn\" will be at ANZ Stadium on Sunday. Shortly before the 7.30pm kick-off, Australian coach and Raiders' legend Mal Meninga will blow the horn and set off the \"Viking clap\".\n\nMost of the \"neutrals\" are expected to be in Canberra's corner, but that is unlikely to bother Politis. In the Roosters' interview, he told how he now delighted in the criticism the club attracted for its quality roster. Others who don't spend their money as wisely talk about how the Roosters don't have a salary cap; they have a salary sombrero.\n\n\"We've got that profile, Eastern Suburbs high rollers ... everyone wants to have a go at us because they are basically bloody jealous,\" he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"But who cares.\"\n\nHe points out that 23 players of its top 30 have been at the club since the under-20s. \"When you buy from outside, you tend to pay more.\"\n\nFirst sponsor\n\nCronk was one outsider Sydney bought before the 2018 season. The other was fullback James Tedesco, the former West Tigers' player who is now considered the best in the game. It's a sore point for Raiders fans after Tedesco agreed to join the club in 2014, only to renege and stay with the Wests Tigers.\n\nPolitis first sponsored the club in 1976 \u2013 his City Ford was the first shirt sponsor in rugby league \u2013 but he had to wait until 2002 for a premiership (there have been another two since, in 2013 and 2018). He signed a rookie coach that year in Ricky Stuart, who now coaches the Raiders.\n\nHe has attracted business heavyweights David Gyngell and Mark Bouris to the board, which for a time included James Packer.\n\nHowever, Politis wonders whether he should have listened to another Sydney titan, John Singleton, when the club changed its name from Eastern Suburbs to Sydney in 1995.\n\n\"John Singleton had a go at us ... he said we should have called ourselves the Bondi Roosters. Maybe there's something in that.\"", "description": "Nick Politis says it's all about getting the right people, and a couple of key recruits suggest he's right.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/10fc4842ed5a9f2962b50ba273838530a147edce", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
