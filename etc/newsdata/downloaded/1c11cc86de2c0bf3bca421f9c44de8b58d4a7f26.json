While other aging-rocker memoirs have earned press for the gossip they\u2019ve revealed, so far the biggest brouhaha about Harry\u2019s book has been about a clumsy attempt at summing her up. \u201cIn her memoir, Debbie Harry proves she\u2019s more than just a pretty blonde in tight pants,\u201d read a Washington Post tweet that went viral for the wrong reasons. Sibbie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s corresponding book review began with disdain (\u201cEven if Debbie Harry, of the band Blondie, isn\u2019t to your taste\u2014her voice too thin, her sexiness too blatant, her music too smooth\u2014you can\u2019t dismiss certain truths about her\u201d) and ended with the backhanded praise of the tweet. In the scorn storm that brewed on social media in response, the journalist Alicia Lutes asked, \u201cLegitimately who has ever thought so little about Debbie fucking Harry?\u201d\n\nOne revelation of the memoir is that the public hasn\u2019t been given a ton to think, good or bad, about Harry over the years. Absolutely there\u2019s a well of fervent and uncomplicated admiration for Blondie\u2019s music, which includes some of the most crystalline pleasure-rushes of the \u201970s and \u201980s: \u201cHeart of Glass,\u201d \u201cHanging on the Telephone,\u201d \u201cOne Way or Another,\u201d \u201cCall Me.\u201d Definitely she\u2019s remembered as a fixture of CGBG, the legendary New York City punk club. But when I went to look up her role in Please Kill Me, the canonical dirt download about that era and place, I found an interview in which she told the writer Legs McNeil, \u201cSupposed to be questions about fucking punk, man,\u201d when he asked about her backstory. Now, with Face It, Harry is here to fill in some of the blanks\u2014briskly, humorously, and mixed in with abstract riffs on appendages and animals.\n\nHer anecdotes begin with her adoption in New Jersey at three months old. \u201cThey claim it\u2019s unusual to have memories of your earliest moments,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut I have tons.\u201d Quickly, her life began to be shaped by that which O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s review fixated on: her beauty. \u201cEven as a little girl, I always attracted sexual attention,\u201d she writes, before wryly running through vignettes about the male gaze. A doctor admired her \u201cbedroom eyes\u201d when she was a baby; a stranger exposed himself to her when she was 8; when on vacation as a preteen, the big-band drummer Buddy Rich, then in his late 30s, followed her home. Her early jobs included waiting tables at the rock venue Max\u2019s Kansas City\u2014\u201cIt was all such a big flirtation, such a scene\u201d\u2014and being a bunny at the Playboy Club, where the patrons were mostly polite to her.\n\nHer entr\u00e9e into rock came through her friendship with the seminal cross-dressing troublemakers the New York Dolls, and her first band, the Stilettos, was fronted by three women. The next band, Blondie and the Banzai Babes, initially featured two female backup singers. By the time it became just Blondie, Harry was the indisputable focal point, though the music was heavily shaped by the other members, including her longtime creative and romantic partner Chris Stein. \u201cMy idea was to bring dancing back to rock,\u201d Harry writes of her musical vision. She recalls an early gig in which the opening band, the Ramones, were kicked out by the bar owners, but the Banzai Babes got to stay. Writes Harry: \u201cThey liked us because we were cute girls\u2014harmless.
