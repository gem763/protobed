If you had a friend who was doing something that was harming themselves - you would hope that a friend would say look let's be honest your behaviour is wrong.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nMum-of-two and journalist Rebecca Wilcox disagreed with her, saying she doesn't believe in smacking children.\n\nShe said she felt \"awful\" about once hitting her four-year-old son when he spilt water on her laptop, calling the moment her \"biggest guilt as a mum.\"\n\nRebecca said it left her feeling like a \"hypocrite\": \"I remember it was all about my loss of control... yeah, he was misbehaving. Yes, he was doing something wrong.\n\n\"But I'm the adult. I should know better. I'm constantly saying 'don't hit your brother, don't hit your friends, don't hit me.' What am I doing?\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWhen she begins saying she saw \"fear\" in her son's eyes and conceded there was \"an effect\" during the debate, Claire rolls her eyes and nods.\n\nThe show's host Ruth Langsford points out that had she hit her son in Scotland under the new laws she could be prosecuted for the act.\n\nClaire adds: \"You'd not be sitting here, today, Rebecca, if that was the case.\"\n\nRebecca responds that she didn't think it would go that far- saying the law would give Child Protection workers tools to intervene and educate parents against corporal punishment.\n\n\"I feel so bad about it I probably should have been prosecuted. That little boy had done nothing wrong. He had tipped a glass of water over my laptop.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nLangsford then agreed with Rebecca, adding that children are taught that physical violence is wrong and pointed out if one adult slapped another in the supermarket it would be an assault under law.\n\nThe segment sparked debate on Twitter , as viewers argued over their points of view on whether smacking was an effective parenting strategy, or just outright wrong.\n\nSome claimed they were smacked as children and it didn't affect them in later life.\n\nOthers argued that they were able to discipline their children using their voice and leading by example.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSome viewers said they learned to fear smacking as children and behaved better as a result.\n\nOne smacking critic argued if her husband hit her it would be labelled domestic abuse and questioned why hitting a child would be treated any differently.\n\nAnother said parents were supposed to be role models to their children and that physical discilpline taught them it is OK to hit people to make a point.\n\nPressure is growing on Westminster to expand Scotland's contentious new law to the rest of the UK.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament earlier this week outlawed all physical punishment against under-16s, giving children the same protection from assault as adults.\n\nA defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" or \"justifiable assault\" for physical force used as a form of discipline on children was removed.\n\nIt is now the 58th country in the world to outlaw smacking, and Wales is now also drawing up similar legislation which passed its first reading in the Welsh assembly last month.\n\nIf Wales bans smacking too, it would leave only children in England and Northern Ireland unprotected.\n\nLast year the Association of Educational Psychologists said smacking is harmful to children\u2019s mental health.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe children's rights charity NSPCC is also against smacking and says it should be banned throughout the UK because it violates children's rights to be free from physical force or violence.\n\nThe Scottish law uses the same definition of physical punishment used by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.\n\nIt includes smacking, slapping and smacking with a hand or an implement, as well as kicking, shaking or throwing children, scratching, pinching, biting, pulling hair or boxing ears, forcing children to stay in uncomfortable positions, burning, scalding or forced ingestion.", "description": "Journalist Claire Muldoon defended physical discipline on This Morning as Scotland becomes the first part of the UK to ban smacking", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Image", "Itv", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20506947.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Slapping.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
