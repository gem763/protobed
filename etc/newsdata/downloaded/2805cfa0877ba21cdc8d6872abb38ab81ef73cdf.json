Unlike the Natanz plant, Fordow was too small to produce usable amounts of civilian nuclear fuel, making it likely that it was created solely for the drive toward a nuclear weapon.\n\nAmerican and Israeli officials were now faced with the fact that ongoing covert operations to sabotage Iran\u2019s nuclear effort had failed to halt the program. The Israeli perspective, as advanced by Barak, was relatively simple: The world was running out of time before Iran entered what Barak called the \u201czone of immunity,\u201d the point at which the nuclear program was so advanced and so well defended that any strike would have too little impact to be worth the risk. The United States, with its bunker-buster bombs that could penetrate deep into underground facilities, could wait to strike. But, Barak argued, Israel had no such luxury. If it was going to act alone, it would need to do it sooner. Some American military planners derided Barak\u2019s tactic as \u201cmowing the grass\u201d \u2014 a small-bore effort that would need to be repeated again and again \u2014 but it might have been more like a way to get the United States to move first. \u201cBarak would tell us, \u2018We can\u2019t do what you do, so we need to do it sooner,\u2019 \u201d says Dennis Ross, who handled Iran policy at the National Security Council during Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cWe interpreted that as designed to put pressure on us.\u201d\n\nA parade of top American officials began flying to Israel during Obama\u2019s first term to take the measure of the Israeli planning and to convince Netanyahu and Barak that the United States was taking the problem seriously and that Iran was hardly on the brink of getting the bomb. \u201cOur message was that we understand your concerns, and please don\u2019t go off on a hair trigger and start a war, because you\u2019re going to want us to come in behind you,\u201d says Wendy Sherman, a top State Department official in Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nOne of the first to make the trip was Robert Gates, whom Obama had asked to stay on at the Pentagon. He arrived in Israel in July 2009, just weeks after the Green Revolution brought thousands of protesters into the streets of Tehran. The Iranian government seemed fragile, and Netanyahu told Gates he was convinced that a military strike on Iran would do more than set back its nuclear program; it could instigate the overthrow of a regime loathed by the Iranian people. Besides, Netanyahu said, as Gates recalls in his memoir, the Iranian response to the attack would be limited. Gates pushed back, just as he had a year earlier against Cheney. He said Netanyahu was misled by history. Perhaps Iraq did not retaliate after Israel bombed the Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981, just as Syria did nothing when Israel bombed a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007. But Iran was very different from Iraq and Syria, he said. His meaning was clear: Iran was a powerful country with a capable military and proxy groups like Hezbollah that could unleash serious violence from just over Israel\u2019s borders.\n\nThe relationship between Obama and Netanyahu continued to fracture. Michael Oren, the Israeli ambassador in Washington at the time, recalls that Netanyahu began to say that \u201cObama is part of the problem, not the solution.\u201d The uncomfortable relationship was apparent to all sides. Arad recalls that when he accompanied Netanyahu to Washington in 2010 for another meeting with Obama, Vice President Joe Biden threw his arm around Arad and said with a smile, \u201cJust remember that I am your best fucking friend here.\u201d\n\n4. \u2018A Highly Complicated Affair\u2019\n\nObama took the possibility of a sudden Israeli strike seriously. American spy satellites watched Israeli drones take off from bases in Azerbaijan and fly south over the Iranian border \u2014 taking extensive pictures of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and probing whether Iranian air defenses spotted the intrusion. American military leaders made guesses about whether the Israelis might choose a time of the month when the light was higher or lower, or a time of the year when sandstorms occur more or less regularly. Military planners ran war games to forecast how Tehran might respond to an Israeli strike and how America should respond in return: Would Iran assume that any attack had been blessed by the United States and hit American military forces in the Middle East? The results were dismal: The Israeli strikes dealt only minor setbacks to Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and the United States was enmeshed in yet another war in the Middle East.\n\nThe White House eventually made the decision that the United States would not join a pre-emptive strike. If Israel launched such a strike, the Pentagon wouldn\u2019t assist in the operation, but it wouldn\u2019t stand in Israel\u2019s way. At the same time, Obama was quietly ordering a buildup of America\u2019s arsenal around the Persian Gulf. If Israel was going to trigger a war, the thinking went, it was better to have forces in the region beforehand rather than rush them there after the fact, when Iran would surely interpret the deployments as a surge to support Israel. Aircraft-carrier strike groups and destroyers with Aegis ballistic-missile defense systems moved through the Strait of Hormuz; F-22 jets arrived in the United Arab Emirates, and Patriot missile batteries were sent to the United Arab Emirates and other gulf allies. Some of the deployments were announced as routine moves to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the Israelis to mistake it for a green light,\u201d one Obama-administration official says.", "description": "Hawks in Israel and America have spent more than a decade agitating for war against the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear program.
