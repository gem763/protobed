That's how it started.\n\n\"He\u2019s quite chilled out and tired this morning after the journey. He always gets treated, cuddled, rewarded and praised which is why we think he keep doing it.\"\n\nAccording to a vet sourced by This Morning, there is \"nothing wrong\" with the practice and it can be seen as good behaviour training for the dog.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nEamonn joked that even he couldn't balance a Toblerone bar on his head.\n\nPaul revealed they didn't know Harlso could do any tricks until he was two-years-old.\n\nHe explained: \"It's an unusual story. Harlso as far as we know up until two-years-old didn\u2019t know any tricks. Sit, stay, roll over. The typical stubborn Duschand.\n\n\"When he was two I was playing fetch one day. It was quite exhausting. I decided to try and balance the toy on his head. It balanced first time. I called Jennifer down and said 'you won\u2019t believe what's going on'.\n\n\"She took a photo of him balancing this little toy chicken.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHarlso played an integral part in Paul's marriage proposal to Jennifer - but he wasn't sure if she said 'yes' to him or the dog.\n\nJennifer said: \"He took eme to new York and then we went to Times Square. He pulled out his phone and had a video of Harley balancing the ring.\n\n\"It was raining at the time so I couldn\u2019t see it clearly. When I realised, how could I say 'no'.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThis Morning viewers took to Twitter after watching Harlso in action on the show.\n\nOne fan said: \"I don't know what's more cute; the dog or the couple!\"\n\n\"Just tuned in to see a man balancing a Toblerone on a dogs head!! Is this what daytime TV has now come too,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"You know the barrel has been scraped when you're watching a dog balancing more than one doughnut on its head\"\n\n\"Awwww......I\u2019m getting a dog. Just don\u2019t tell my cat. She\u2019ll be f***ing livid,\" joked a fourth.\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "Viral sensation Harlso balanced a Toblerone, pumpkin and two donuts on his head live on This Morning", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20560987.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Owners-of-adorable-dog-who-balances-things-on-his-head-hit-back-at-cruelty-claims.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
