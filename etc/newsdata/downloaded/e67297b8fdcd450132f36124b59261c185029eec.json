Maybe (if we had beaten) Crystal Palace here at home... we would have been sixth or seventh in the table, but maybe after one game you can be four or five positions back,\u201d Pellegrini told reporters.\n\n\u201cEvery game you must play as if you\u2019re playing against the best team. It\u2019s why I don\u2019t only talk about West Ham, there are big teams who for whatever reason cannot be consistent.\n\n\u201cYou have 20 teams who all have money to get good players. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to play 100% concentrated, because if not, it\u2019s very difficult to win the game.\u201d\n\nWest Ham host promoted Sheffield United, who beat Arsenal to move up to ninth, on Saturday and Pellegrini praised his counterpart Chris Wilder, whose side have been unbeaten in four away games this season.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a consistent team,\u201d the Chilean manager said. \u201cHaving come from the Championship... they\u2019ve a difficult style \u2014 direct football, which we can prepare for.\n\n\u201cI think that Sheffield United reflect his (Wilder) mentality. It\u2019s clear in the way they play, it\u2019s absolutely English football \u2014 strong players who work a lot over 90 minutes. They work to win the first and the second ball.\u201d\n\nFull back Aaron Cresswell is back in contention after missing the 2-0 defeat at Everton but defender Winston Reid and winger Michail Antonio will not be involved.\n\n\u201cCompared with last weekend, Aaron Cresswell worked the whole week without any problems,\u201d Pellegrini said.\n\n\u201cWinston Reid continued his recovery and will probably will play the next game with the Under-23s on Wednesday. Antonio hasn\u2019t recovered, he has a long injury at the moment.\u201d", "description": "West Ham United's freefall in the Premier League standings in the past few weeks is proof that teams cannot afford to be inconsistent and take their foot off the gas in a highly-competitive league, manager Manuel Pellegrini said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444510448&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N17S", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
