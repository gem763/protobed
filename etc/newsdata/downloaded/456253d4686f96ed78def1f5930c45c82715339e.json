I cant handle this!!\u201d along with multiple purple heart emojis.\n\nThe post was immediately flooded with adoring comments, with Sofia Ritchie writing \u201cOmg I can\u2019t deal\u201d with a heart eyes emoji.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn a video shared alongside the posts, little Stormi can be seen modelling the adorable costume with style, although she appears to look baffled and a little confused at what was happening to her.\n\nHowever, she reassuringly lets out a little giggle near the end of the short clip that made fans\u2019 hearts melt.\n\nKylie made an unforgettable entrance to the Met Gala in May 2019 as she stepped onto the pink carpet wearing a glitzy form-fitting mermaid gown with purple feathered train, finished off with long lavender hair.\n\nThe gown itself was made of interlaced crystal mesh, Swarovski crystals and ostrich feathers and had removable large feathered sleeves.\n\nHer show-stopping look was a nod to this year's theme, \"Camp: Notes on Fashion.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
