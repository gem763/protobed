What comes next? I do think it is something around digital currency.\u201d\n\nHarker\u2019s comment came amid a heated debate around the world over privately issued cryptocurrencies, fearing they would undermine a central bank\u2019s ability to lead effective monetary policies.\n\nThis week, executives from some of the biggest American banks complained to the Federal Reserve that Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency Libra would pose as a monetary threat in the September Federal Advisory Council meeting.\n\n\u201cAs consumers adopt Libra, more deposits could migrate onto the platform, effectively reducing liquidity, and that disintermediation may further expand into loan and investment services,\u201d the executives said.\n\nMany of the major economies in the world have started planning to have a national digital currency.\n\nChina\u2019s crypto chief Mu Changchun said one of the main goals for the Chinese national stablecoin Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) is to preempt the rise of Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency Libra even before it is launched.\n\n\u201cIf we allow Libra come to the market, we would open the underground economic channels,\u201d Mu explained. \u201cIt will be hard for China to manage foreign currencies and the $50,000 capital outflow cap would be less effective,\u201d Mu said.\n\nAgustin Carstens, chief of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said central banks will likely soon need to issue their own digital currencies.\n\nBIS, known as a central bank for central banks in Europe, is supporting global central banks\u2019 efforts to research and develop digital currencies based on national fiat currencies, Carstens said in an interview with the Financial Times.", "description": "Philadelphia Federal Reserve bank president Patrick Harker said it is \u201cinevitable\u201d for the central banks to start issuing digital currency.", "authors": ["David Pan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6P7CiiVwruqwvA3jfI2Vew--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/1aefdfda18ec1d7ee46eee814930eb6f", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
