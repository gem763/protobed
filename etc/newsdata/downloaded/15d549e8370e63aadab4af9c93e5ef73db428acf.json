Kanteva\u2019s team see silver peaking at nearly $22 an ounce by the end of next year, with prices averaging around $20.91 an ounce over the year as a whole.\n\nEarlier, IHS Markit\u2019s monthly purchasing manager indexes had suggested the eurozone economy was close to stalling at the end of the third quarter, as months of weakness in manufacturing started to spill over into the services sector. German manufacturing, a regional bright spot for the last decade, contracted at the steepest rate since 2009.\n\nIHS\u2019s survey of U.S. manufacturing also discerned a further slowdown in both activity and hiring, but the index reading of 51.0 was still better than the 50.3 expected, and an improvement from August.\n\nEven so, the company pointed to clear signs of a weakening dynamic.\n\n\u201cJobs are now also being cut across the surveyed companies for the first time since January 2010, as firms have become more risk averse and increasingly eager to cut costs,\u201d IHS said.\n\nThe JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analysts said they see gold\u2019s recent moves as \u201cquite reminiscent of the early-stage onset of a recession, when, courtesy of their anti-cyclical safe-haven characteristics, gold, bonds and the U.S. dollar tend to rally in the dying days of the expansion and into a recession.\u201d\n\nThey said they still don\u2019t think a recession is fully priced into gold yet and see prices hitting $1,780 an ounce by the end of next year.\n\nElsewhere, also rose, by 2.0% to $950.61 an ounce as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell eight basis points to 1.67%.", "description": "Gold Rides New Wave of Risk Aversion to Two-Week High", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED1M0ED_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
