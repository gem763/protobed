Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is causing him to rethink his decision to stay out of the presidential race, according to CNBC.\n\nBloomberg is reportedly mulling the possibility of entering the race \u2013 if Biden drops out \u2013 \u201caccording to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private,\u201d CNBC reported.\n\nThe former New York City mayor\u2019s reconsideration has been ignited by Warren\u2019s growing support over Biden.\n\nVia CNBC:\n\nBloomberg has signaled he\u2019s \u201cstill looking at\u201d running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden\u2019s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.\n\nBloomberg ruled out a presidential bid in March, telling supporters that he was \u201cclear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile there would be no higher honor than serving as president, my highest obligation as a citizen is to help the country the best way I can, right now. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do, including the launch of a new effort called Beyond Carbon,\u201d he stated at the time.\n\nWarren has positioned herself as a viable threat to Biden, who held the frontrunner status in the early months of the Democrat primary. The Massachusetts senator has surged in recent weeks, besting Biden in a number of national polls as well as early primary and caucus state polls.
