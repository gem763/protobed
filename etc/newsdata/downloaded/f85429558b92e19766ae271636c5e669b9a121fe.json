Australia is doing our bit on climate change and we reject any suggestion to the contrary.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister also invoked the spectre of the tensions between the US and China and said Australia would not take sides.\n\nHis key message was about the oceans \u2013 the scourge of plastic pollution and illegal fishing \u2013 both of which he said posed threats to ocean-dependent nations like Australia and its Pacific neighbours.\n\n\u201cScientists estimate that in just 30 years\u2019 time the weight of plastics in our oceans will exceed the weight of fish,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Morrison listed the initiatives already underway, including his proposed ban of exports of plastic, paper, glass and tyres from 2020, as well as $167 million in grants announced during the election to help commercialise recycling.\n\n\u201cPreventing pollution entering our oceans, and creating valuable new products,\u201d he said in his speech.\n\nMr Morrison believes commercially viable recycling should be facilitated by government but led by the private sector. He cited the initiative announced in New York overnight by Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forest\u2019s Minderoo Foundation.\n\nIt aims to initially raise $US20 billion ($29 billion) and eventually as much as $US100 billion a year via a levy or fee on the world\u2019s makers of plastic. The industry would use the money to collect waste plastic, and recycle it back into new polymer resins.\n\n\u201cIndustry-led mechanisms for investing in new recycling technologies and mitigating plastic waste in rivers, beaches and oceans on a global scale are essential,\u201d Mr Morrison said.\n\nMr Morrison also cited illegal fishing as a threat to Australia and the region and without naming names, blasted those nations which practise it as thieves.\n\n\u201cThere are too many nations standing by while their nationals are thieving the livelihoods of their neighbours,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAustralia is acting not only in our own interest but helping Pacific Island countries to reduce illegal fishing which depletes the fish stocks Pacific Islanders rely on for jobs, revenue and food security.\u201d\n\nAustralia has borne some criticism this week in New York over climate change, fuelled in part by Mr Morrison decision not to attend attend a UN climate summit on Monday.\n\nThis included a spray from Sir David Attenborough this week against Mr Morrison for once bringing a lump of coal into Parliament.\n\nMr Morrison\u2019s UN speech was heavy in defence.\n\nMr Morrison noted his recent decision, announced at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu, to give Pacific neighbours $500 million in foreign aid to help mitigate the effects of climate change, rather than donate to the UN\u2019s Global Green Climate Fund.\n\n\u201cThis enables us to target our support directly to Pacific Island nations, ensuring they receive this support in a more timely and targeted fashion,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, it provides greater transparency, fairness and accountability to Australian taxpayers who rightly demand attention and support from government to address challenges at home, in particular boosting drought resilience through our investment in national water grid infrastructure.\u201d\n\nMr Morrison said Austraia\u2019s Paris target of reducing emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per ent on 2005 levels was \u201ca credible, fair, responsible and achievable contribution to global climate change action\u201d.\n\nHe mentioned the expansion of the Snowy-Hydro scheme, and said Australia led the world in renewable energy.\n\n\u201cAustralia now has the highest per capita investment in clean energy technologies of anywhere in the world and one in five Australian households has rooftop solar systems,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cWe are successfully balancing our global responsibilities with sensible and practical policies to secure our environmental and economic future.\u201d\n\nMr Morrison sad the concerns children have for the environment and their future must be respected and taken seriously.\n\n\u201cWe must respect and harness the passion and aspiration of our younger generations, rather than allow others to compound or, worse, facelessly exploit their anxiety for their own agendas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe must similarly not allow their concerns to be dismissed or diminished as this can also increase their anxiety. What parent could do otherwise.\n\n\u201cOur children have a right not just to their future but to their optimism.\u201d\n\nThe speech capped off a week-long official visit to the United States which has been dominated by trying to balance the relationship with the US with that of China.\n\n\u201cThe world today is complex and contested,\u201d Mr Morrison told the UN.\n\n\u201cMany fatalistically see a polarised world where countries feel pushed to make binary choices. Australia will continue to resist this path.\n\n\u201cAustralia will continue to seek to honestly maintain our great alliances and comprehensive partnerships in good repair, from our great and powerful friends to our smallest Pacific Island family neighbours.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Australian Financial Review.
