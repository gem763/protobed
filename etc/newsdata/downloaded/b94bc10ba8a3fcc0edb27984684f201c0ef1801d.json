It has struck more than 200 deals worth a total $50 billion since 2003, including a stake in the cybersecurity-software company McAfee last year and the $3.7 billion buyout of mortgage software company Ellie Mae in February.\n\nSophos shareholders will receive $7.40 in cash (583 pence) per share, a 37.1% premium to the company\u2019s closing share price of 425.5 pence on Friday. However, the exact amount received by investors will vary depending on the exchange rate at the time of completion, subject to regulatory clearance.\n\nShares in Sophos Group PLC soared 37% on news of the deal and were trading at 578 pence in London.\n\n\u201cOne thing worth bearing in mind is that the offer is denominated in dollars, and given the volatility we\u2019ve seen in sterling recently that means the final pounds and pence value of the deal could end up being significantly different to that reported today,\u201d warned Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nHyett added: \u201cIf sterling weakens then that\u2019s good news for UK investors, but should a Brexit deal be agreed, a rally in sterling could leave investors out of pocket. For those unwilling to stomach the volatility and who want to lock in the current price, it might make sense to sell the shares now rather than hold on until the deal completes \u2013 even if that does rule out the possibility of a bump in price from any rival bid.\u201d\n\nSophos, which is based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, was floated in 2015 by private equity firm by Apax Partners for \u00a31bn, at a time when cyber security products were in demand in the wake of several high-profile ransomware attacks. Its customers include Under Armour UAA, +1.78%, Ford Motor F, +1.86%, and Xerox XRX, +2.05%\n\nHowever, in January, the FTSE-250 company saw its shares fall by 25% after suffering a decline in lower annual billings as hardware and sales to new customers fell.\n\nSeth Boro, managing partner at Thoma Bravo said: \u201cSophos has a market-leading product portfolio and we believe that, by applying Thoma Bravo\u2019s expertise, operational framework and experience, we can support the business and accelerate its evolution and growth.\u201d\n\nThe Sophos deal is the latest UK listed company to be taken private in recent months as US buyout funds race to deploy billions in unspent capital.\n\nSo far this year, there have been seven public-to-private deals in the UK with an aggregate value of $12.7bn, according to data provider Preqin.\n\nAdvent made a \u00a34 billion bid to buy UK aerospace and engineering firm Cobham, while a consortium which included Blackstone and Lego\u2019s founding family took Merlin Entertainments private in a deal that valued the world\u2019s second biggest operator of theme parks after Disney at just under $6bn, including debt.\n\n\u201cAnother day, another takeover of a UK company by a foreign business...\u201d, said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.", "description": "US private equity firm Thoma Bravo makes first overseas investment with Sophos in a deal which values the UK cyber security company deal at around $3.948...", "authors": ["Lina Saigol"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT212_sophos_ZG_20191014035420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
