USA TODAY\n\nWhile the MLB collective bargaining agreement with its players' union expires after the 2021 season, the Professional Baseball Agreement (PBA) between the league and minor league teams expires at the end of next season.\n\nConsiderable changes could be coming to the minor leagues, according to Baseball America. With MLB prioritizing the upgrading of stadium facilities in the minors, MLB has proposed eliminating 25 percent of minor league teams, dropping the total number of clubs from about 160 to approximately 120. The report also said the two sides are further apart in any negotiation dating back to 1990.\n\nThe ramifications would be significant: More than three-dozen cities across the country could lose their minor league team, and thousands of players would be out of jobs.\n\nIn addition to the elimination of teams, leagues would undergo reorganization so that some Class AAA teams would drop to Class A, and selected Class A teams would bump up to Class AAA.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the very initial stages of the negotiations where each side is presenting to others the issues and concerns they have with the existing PBA,\" MLB deputy commissioner Dan Halem told Baseball America.\n\n\"From the perspective of MLB clubs, our principal goals are upgrading the minor league facilities that we believe have inadequate standards for potential MLB players, improving the working conditions for MiLB players, including their compensation, improving transportation and hotel accommodations, providing better geographic affiliations between major league clubs and their affiliates, as well as better geographic lineups of leagues to reduce player travel.\"", "description": "According to a report, Minor League Baseball could lose up to 42 teams and undergo significant realignment in a new MLB proposal.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published A.M.
