He was on the sidelines of the match but was spotted wearing the Apple Watch.\n\nThe fine was levied as according to NFL rules, no player can wear any device that transmits messages while on the playing field. There is a complete ban on all kinds of electronic devices during the matches.\n\nDon't Miss 1.2 K SHARES 331 SHARES 3.5 K SHARES\n\nApparently Ben Roethlisberger was furious with the fine and said that he would appeal it, as he didn't know he had it on it hand during the match. He was recovering from the elbow injury with a cast on his right hand. According to him, his wife helped him get dressed in his current condition and strapped the Apple Watch on hand and he had absolutely no idea about it.\n\nOddly enough, it isn't the first time Ben has been under the radar of NFL for carrying communication devices on the field. In 2015, he was spotted using a device that looked like a smartphone during a tournament with Ravens.\n\nApple\n\nThis occurred during the 'Defategate' where a player was found deflating and tampering with footballs used in the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts game. Due to this, the NFL had a sharp eye on the players.\n\nLater it was revealed that he was just removing a wristband that contained the play calls and was using it before the offensive series. He wasn't fined then, but it looks like this time he might not be so lucky.", "description": "We know how Apple Watch has been saving lives with its heart-rate sensors and ECG features.
