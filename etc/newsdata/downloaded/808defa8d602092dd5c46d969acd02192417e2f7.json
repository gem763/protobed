But when you explain that that same amount of money is enough to cover their power, gas, and water bills, suddenly the motivation level goes way up. Those bills are painful, and avoiding them forever is something everyone aspires to.\n\nI know I\u2019m motivated by delicious food, so I\u2019m trying extra hard to ensure my favourite restaurant stock pays me enough in dividends each month to pay for a free lunch every day.\n\nDoes that inspire you? It should. Here\u2019s how you can make sure you never pay for lunch again.\n\nThe best burgers If you do an informal survey of all your friends, I guarantee at least some of them will say A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund (TSX:AW.UN) makes their favourite hamburgers. I\u2019ll bet many will also enjoy A&W\u2019s onion rings, its root beer floats, or some of the other offerings on the menu.\n\nFrom an investing perspective, I\u2019m also a big fan of A&W. The company consistently delivers excellent results because of a continued focus on using the best ingredients, a commitment to delivering high-quality food, and some of the best promotions in the entire fast food industry.\n\nFor instance, A&W was the first company to jump on the Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: ) alternative burger bandwagon, introducing their own version of the vegetarian burger back in 2018. It was an instant hit, with many restaurants running out of patties. The Beyond Meat burger is now a fixture on the company\u2019s menu.\n\nBecause of these excellent managerial qualities, A&W has been posting consistently stellar results for years now. Its second-quarter numbers continued that trend with the all-important same-store sales metric up 10.3%.\n\nTotal royalty income rose 15.3%. The difference between the two is that A&W opened some 40 new restaurants over the last year, further cementing its status as Canada\u2019s second-largest burger joint.\n\nA&W is a royalty trust, meaning that investors directly get 3% of each restaurant\u2019s sales. As the royalty trust is separate from the operating arm of the company, it has virtually zero expenses, which ensures that A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund can afford to a payout ratio of 100% of earnings and doesn\u2019t have to reinvest in the business.\n\nThis translates into succulent dividends, payouts that keep creeping up as the company continues to post stellar results. Since the beginning of 2018, the fund has increased its dividend six times.\n\nThe current distribution is $0.159 per share every month, which works out to $1.91 per share on an annualized basis. That\u2019s good enough for a 4.8% yield \u2014 an excellent payout in today\u2019s low interest world.\n\nNever pay for lunch again Given that there are 365 days in a year and the average lunch at A&W costs $11 (hey, you gotta get the onion rings!), you\u2019d need $4,015 annually to indulge in your lunch habit. That works out to $335 per month.\n\nTo get $335 each and every month from A&W stock, you\u2019d have to buy 2,107 A&W shares. As I type this, one share will set you back $39.80. You\u2019re looking at a total investment of $83,858 to never pay for a lunch yourself again.\n\nImagine how nice it\u2019ll be to collect more than $10 per day in dividends just from one company. It\u2019s like hanging out with a best friend who always buys you lunch.\n\nSome folks can\u2019t afford $83,000, and that\u2019s fine. Just 100 A&W shares generates $15.90 per month in dividends, which is enough for one free lunch a month. It\u2019s a great start.\n\nThe bottom line A&W\u2019s management is doing a lot of things right. The company is already a good investment choice because of its focus on high-quality ingredients, a nice restaurant atmosphere, and great promotions.\n\nGetting free lunch out of the deal is the icing on the cake \u2014 or, maybe in this case, the free lunch is the fizz on the root beer \u2014 in a frosted mug, of course.\n\nFool contributor Nelson Smith owns shares of A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund.\n\nThe Motley Fool\u2019s purpose is to help the world invest, better.
