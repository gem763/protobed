If I have to be an academic or have to be non-threatening to you in some way? Why can't I be a part of the group as well?\"\n\n\"I think I had a genuine psychological breakdown where I wanted just nothing to do,\" she confessed. \"I didn't want to be seen. I didn't want to have to take a photo, do a magazine, walk a carpet. I didn't want to be seen in public at all because... I believed that I was going to be mocked, or spat at, or someone was going to yell at me, or people would stone me or savage me for just being out and being whatever.\"\n\nIS MEGAN FOX INSECURE?\n\nMEGAN FOX STRIPS DOWN IN NEW LINGERIE CAMPAIGN\n\nShe explained, \"I didn\u2019t look perfect or I was too fat or too thin. I was stupid or I was offensive. I was a waste of space or a bad actress. Whatever you could think of, I anticipated experiencing that, because my belief system was that the world wasn't going to accept me, so I went through a very dark moment after that.\"\n\nThe Memphis native said she found her saving grace in the form of motherhood. Fox shares three sons, Bodhi Ransom, Journey River and Noah Shannon, with husband Brian Austin Green. Unfortunately, she says, motherhood may have actually hurt her career as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Being a mother is not something really respected in this industry. If anything it's considered as a handicap,\" she said. \"And that's unfortunate because it's not acknowledged, what we're juggling, what we're doing.\"", "description": "Megan Fox revealed she suffered a breakdown after her 2009 film \"Jennifer's Body\" was critically panned and bombed at the box office.", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/megan-fox-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
