The bipartisan bill reduced mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offences, and eased the federal \"three strike\" rule imposing a life sentence for three or more convictions.\n\nThe bill is partly aimed at redressing sentencing laws, which have disproportionally affected African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans.\n\nTrump tweeted: \"But now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise. Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is \u2014 but I didn't see them around when we needed help getting it passed.\"\n\nJohn Legend.
