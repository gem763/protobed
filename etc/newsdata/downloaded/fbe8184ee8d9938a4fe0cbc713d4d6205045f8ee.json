'I just went for the first one that I felt alright in. I've been to try it on again and I hate it. If I don't find a dress today then I can't walk down the aisle.'\n\nAdding to the pressure, Mel's super opinionated maid-of-honour Sara will not let Mel make the same mistake twice - and bluntly tells her one of the dresses reveals 'visible dimples' in her legs and bum.\n\nMel (pictured) threatens to call off wedding if she doesn't find a dress in tonight's episode of TLC's Say Yes to the Dress Lancashire\n\nPresenter Gok Wan (pictured) and blunt maid of honour Sara clash as she tells the bride-to-be she can see 'dimples' in her legs and bum in one of the dresses she tries on\n\nSara explains: 'My role today is speak my mind, tell her the truth, because I don't think anybody else will. I can't keep my gob shut when I think something looks a mess!'\n\nDespite detecting a sense of panic, super stylist Gok Wan is hoping to come to Mel's rescue and find her the dress of her dreams, starting with a gorgeous lace fishtail dress. Trying on the dress, Mel is lost for words.\n\n'It's not what I expected,' she gasps. 'But my heart is pounding out of my chest because I just know full well when I go downstairs there's going to be some kind of negativity.'\n\nWalking out in front of her entourage, Mel's suspicions are confirmed when Sara takes issue with the dress's skirt.\n\n'Right, how can I put this without being awful,' Sara starts. 'Your stomach is really flat in it, it's not about your stomach. But behind I can see dimples in your legs and your bum.'\n\nMel reveals she has already bought a dress, but now can't bear the thought of wearing it.

Pictured, wearing dress three\n\nIn an attempt to relieve the tension in the room, Gok voices the opinion that he can't see any dimples at all.\n\nAdamant there are visible dimples on the dress, Sara sternly replies: 'It's not shocking, but I'm just telling you that's what I can see.'\n\nTrying to calm the situation once again, Gok wonders whether Sara is just seeing creases in the material.\n\n'No,' Sara says bluntly in reply, before adding: 'I don't know if Gok's ever met anyone as vocal as me.'\n\nSeeing the funny side, Mel realises the dress isn't the one for her.\n\n'It's all turned into my dimply bum and not about the dress,' she laughs, before asking if she has any back fat in the gown.\n\nBlunt as ever, Sara pipes up again and says: 'I don't think your bra helps!' as Gok looks on in shock.\n\nMel continues to try on an array of dresses after her friend Sara tells her there are 'visible dimples' on the first dress she tries on. Pictured, in dress three\n\nAfter finding her dress dress, Mel says: 'I love it. There's no dimples there! That feeling in the pit of my stomach has completely changed.'

'There's no dimples there! That feeling in the pit of my stomach has completely changed.'\n\nAs Gok puts it, he's ready to 'wrestle the tigress' and show Sara and the entourage Mel in the new dress.\n\nThis time, Mel, Sara and everyone else are in tears of happiness.\n\n'I can't actually believe that her dress has made me cry,' Sara says, running up to give her best friend a hug. 'You ain't got no dimples, you won't even have to wear fat pants!'\n\nWithout a dry eye in the house, and with just 71 days to go, Mel has finally found her dream dress.\n\nGok jokes he's ready to 'wrestle the tigress' and show Sara and the entourage Mel in the new dress - and it goes down well (pictured)", "description": "Mel, from Lancashire, threatens to call off the wedding if she doesn't find her dream gown in tonight's return of TLC's Say Yes to the Dress Lancashire.", "authors": ["Chloe Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/10/20172326-0-image-a-18_1571994286593.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
