They came in red jerseys of current stars but also of past ones, a nod to the beloved players not around long enough to play a role in this October miracle.\n\nAnd among those red waves were bright blue sharks \u2014 actually people in shark costumes, which only makes sense if you know the backstory. Nationals outfielder Gerardo Parra\u2019s walk-up song is \u201cBaby Shark,\u201d the catchy children\u2019s tune that has become the Nationals\u2019 unofficial fight song and, in turn, the city\u2019s new theme song.", "description": "As the World Series returned to the nation\u2019s capital for the first time since 1933, many in the city rallied around the Nationals and their unofficial shark mascot.", "authors": ["Juliet Macur", "Doug Mills", "Photographs By"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/26/sports/26series-essay-top/26series-essay-top-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
