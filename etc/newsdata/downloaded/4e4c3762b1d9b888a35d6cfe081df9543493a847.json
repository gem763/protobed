So was Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google; Andy Garcia, the actor; and Vladimir Nabokov, the novelist. So, for that matter, were Jesus, Joseph and Mary, who took refuge in Egypt to escape Herod\u2019s wrath.\n\nUntil President Trump took office, no country\u2019s welcome mat rivaled that of the United States, which year after year accepted and resettled more refugees that any other nation, and did so with broad bipartisan support. Accepting refugees has been an expression of American compassion, American global leadership and, not least, American self-interest. Many refugees \u2014 ambitious, determined, grateful \u2014 have invigorated their communities. And by resettling refugees, Washington has encouraged other countries to do the same, providing a relief valve for conflict zones across the world.\n\nNow, as the Trump administration presses ahead with every means at its disposal to transform the United States into a fortress of exclusion, it has whacked the U.S. refugee program to the lowest level in its four-decade history. In setting a ceiling of 18,000 refugee admissions next year \u2014 a 40 percent cut from the current year\u2019s admissions and down from about 85,000 that President Barack Obama admitted shortly before he left office \u2014 the administration has turned its back on American tradition, values and preeminence on the world stage.\n\nFar from making America great again, Mr. Trump is making it meek, churlish and inhospitable.\n\nGratuitously, he is also, in effect, inviting communities to turn their backs on the world\u2019s most vulnerable and desperate. In announcing that it would slash refugee admissions, the administration also said Mr. Trump had issued an executive order requiring that states and localities consent, in writing, to the resettlements of people already thoroughly vetted by the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies. Whatever the impact of that order \u2014 and officials suggested it would be minimal \u2014 it\u2019s a disgrace on its face. Imagine if, a century ago, Americans had been asked to \u201cconsent\u201d to the annual influx of Irish, Italian, Jewish and other immigrants \u2014 who were then widely regarded as unlettered and unwashed.\n\nThe administration\u2019s stated rationale for drastically shrinking the refugee program is that it is busy processing a surge in asylum seekers, mainly from Central America, who now contribute to a backlog of nearly a million cases in immigration courts. In fact, one has nothing to do with the other. Relatively few applications from asylum seekers, most of whom are already in the United States, will ultimately be accepted \u2014 perhaps 15 percent or so \u2014 while refugees, by definition, have already been thoroughly screened and assessed by U.S. officials, often after waiting for years in war-ravaged countries. Many have played crucial and dangerous roles as translators for U.S. troops in the field.\n\nMr. Trump and his in-house xenophobe, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, seem intent on driving down the annual refugee intake to zero, as they had been rumored to be considering. Pushback from the military, including prominent figures such as Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Adm. William H. McRaven, former head of United States Special Operations, seems to have preserved the program, at least for now, albeit in drastically diminished form.\n\nUltimately, the refugee program is a barometer of America\u2019s prestige. It stands as an example to other nations. As it contracts, so too does this country\u2019s greatness.", "description": "President Trump has taken an ax to a barometer of U.S. leadership.", "authors": ["Editorial Board", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_9UMUdRpBM2Bd_-dFpeoTORQKrE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZXDTE5XBQYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
