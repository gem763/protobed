French president Emmanuel Macron insisted that Europe needed to focus on its internal reforms.\n\n\u201cThe EU was formed as a response to fascism, but is now running scared in the face of populists and fascism,\u201d Kurti told the Guardian.\n\nKosovo at 10: challenges overshadow independence celebrations Read more\n\nCriticising Macron, he said: \u201cYou cannot say first we need internal reform in the EU and then external enlargement \u2013 they go hand in hand. Europe is such an important historical project that no one man can be its author, directing or leading it. We have always seen that when [the outgoing EU Commission president] Jean-Claude Juncker said there would be no further expansion in the next five years, the situation in the Balkans got much worse.\n\n\u201cYes, the EU is important for the Balkans, but the Balkans is very important for the EU. Berlin and Paris should know this well, and it is really sad, for all of us, that they forget this. In a couple of decades, historians will write there were not two world wars, but just one world war with two episodes, and it all started in Sarajevo.\u201d\n\nKurti\u2019s leftist Albanian nationalist movement Vet\u00ebvendosje (Self-determination) emerged as the strongest party following snap elections last month. Imprisoned for 18 months by Serbian police during the height of its military conflict with Kosovo in 1999, Kurti, 44, finds himself on the verge of power, promising to end Kosovo\u2019s two decades of neoliberalism.\n\nHe is currently in talks with the centre-right party LDK, which came second, on forming an administration, in which a minimum of 30% will be women. Kurti predicted an agreement within a month and says his priority is jobs and justice, not reaching a deal with Serbia.\n\nAfter years of failed prosecutions against corruption, he promised to end what he considered the judiciary\u2019s capture by the state.\n\nHe said he was interested in UK-style unexplained wealth orders and a new vetting process led by a dynamic chief prosecutor. \u201cWe need to produce our own homegrown Eliot Ness, and he must become the most famous person in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have almost 200 prosecutors, but some lack knowledge and some lack courage, and some lack both. They have to be liberated from the state.\u201d\n\nFacing mounting debt and emigration, Kurti said he was also determined to end the huge skills gap in the labour force, focus on technical education and reducing industry\u2019s dependence on the crippling interest rates of foreign-owned banks: \u201cWe must make our country liveable and persuade more people to stay in our country.\u201d\n\nBut Kurti will be under international pressure to reach an agreement with Serbia. The US has just appointed a new special envoy to revive the dialogue between the two countries..\n\nHe warned that the 100% import tariffs that his predecessor slapped on Serbian goods will be lifted only if there are full reciprocal measures on freeing Kosovo\u2019s trade into Serbia. He said Belgrade also had to end its international diplomatic campaign to persuade countries to derecognise Kosovo. \u201cIf they want to start dialogue, they should explicitly stop the slander about our right to statehood,\u201d he said.\n\nSerbia, for instance, has opposed Kosovo\u2019s membership of Interpol, Unesco and the Council of Europe. \u201cSerbia should face its own past, instead of looking at Kosovo and Albania through military binoculars. Serbia needs some introspection.\u201d\n\nKurti said his three-stage programme will start within a bottom-up dialogue with Serbs in Kosovo on practical cooperation, for example in agriculture, followed by a review of the real-life impact of the 33 agreements signed with Serbia under EU auspices from 2012, and finally a meeting with Josep Borrell, the incoming EU foreign policy chief. \u201cWe cannot afford another failed dialogue. It must have clear principles,\u201d Kurti said. Borrell has promised to go to Kosovo as his first overseas visit.\n\nKurti said he was totally opposed to land swaps with Serbia, an idea pursued this year by Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic and Hashim Thaci, the president of Kosovo. \u201cWhatever new border you form, there will be Serbs or Albanians on the other side, and they pretend you can do it peacefully.\u201d\n\nSerbs fear that his true agenda will be to seek some kind of confederation with Albania, so marginalising the Serb minority in northern Kosovo.\n\nSerbia has already condemned as provocative his decision to meet foreign diplomats at his party headquarters with an Albanian flag behind him. He said Kosovo\u2019s official flag was imposed on the country with a ruling that it contain no red, no black and no eagle, \u201cas if we were declaring independence from Albania, and not Serbia\u201d.\n\nBut he vowed in his official capacity as prime minister that he will retain and respect the official flag of Kosovo: \u201cI have more important tasks than rearranging the furniture in the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201d", "description": "In exclusive interview, leftwinger Albin Kurti condemns the bloc\u2019s refusal to halt Balkan enlargement", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour", "Agron Bajrami"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/355d4109f3ce0529dac375be13879893e2421f3f/0_0_4894_2937/master/4894.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4ceb64442dcc52cc1384704d721e676e", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
