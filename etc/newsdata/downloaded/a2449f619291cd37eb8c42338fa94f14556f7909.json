Recommendations are separate from any business incentives.\n\nIf you\u2019re still on the fence about getting your own Away, the brand\u2019s latest release might help you make up your mind. Just in time for holiday travel plans, the Away luggage has just released the sleek Maverick carry-on bag (starting at $275), featuring a variety of carry-on bags that come with premium leather trim, personalized tags, and a lifetime warranty. As someone who\u2019s been waitlisted forever on their Dwyane Wade collab, I can\u2019t guarantee how long the Maverick will be available before selling out.\n\nWhile I love my Away carry-on, the brand\u2019s large suitcase is also the best hard-sided suitcase we\u2019ve tested at Reviewed, winning the best hard-sided suitcase. The Maverick edition offers two carry-on bag sizes, the Carry-On ($275) and the Bigger Carry-On ($295), and two checked luggage sizes, the Medium ($325) and the Large ($345) in two colors. They\u2019re each available in Towncar (black) and Trench (light brown). All four bags feature a luxurious-looking tan leather trim, as well as Away\u2019s standard interior compression system, which helps you pack more than you need. In addition, they each come with a hidden laundry bag, TSA-approved combination lock, and 360-degree spinner wheels. On top of that, the collection also features a weekender, a backpack, and the Dropdown Dopp($75), which is a toiletries bag that claims to carry extra-sharp items and make going through airport security much faster.\n\nThe only thing the Maverick lacks? An ejectable battery, which is standard in other Away models. In terms of personalization, you get to design your premium leather name tag and your personalized letters on the suitcase itself. Like other Away suitcases, the Maverick also comes with a lifetime warranty, which means you\u2019ll receive a brand new, exactly the same Maverick if anything happens to your old one.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShop the Maverick Collection on Away starting at $275\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
