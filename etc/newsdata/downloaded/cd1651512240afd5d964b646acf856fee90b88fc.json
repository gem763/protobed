In a blog post, Amazon announced that the service is available now on a wide range of its streaming sticks and streaming boxes, and it can also be found on \u201cFire TV Edition\u201d smart TVs, which have the Fire TV operating system built in. After a price hike that Google announced back in April, YouTube TV now costs $50 a month.\n\nThe reason it\u2019s taken so long for YouTube TV to arrive on Amazon\u2019s streaming platform is that, up until April of this year, Amazon and Google were locked in a feud. Google refused to allow its streaming apps on Amazon hardware, and Amazon withheld Chromecast support from its Amazon Prime Video streaming app. YouTube arrived on Fire TV back in July, and now it\u2019s the turn of its live TV-focused sibling.\n\nAs of April this year, YouTube TV includes over 70 live channels around the US, which cover sports, news, entertainment, and films. The latest channels to be added to YouTube TV were Discovery\u2019s lineup, including the Discovery Channel as well as HGTV, Food Network, and TLC. Other networks available on YouTube TV include CNN, ESPN, and FX.\n\nAmazon says the following devices should support YouTube TV:\n\nFire TV Stick (2nd Gen)\n\nFire TV Stick 4K\n\nFire TV Cube (2nd Gen)\n\nFire TV Edition smart TVs (including models from Toshiba, Insignia, Element, and Westinghouse)\n\nFire TV Cube (1st Gen)\n\nFire TV (2nd Gen)\n\nFire TV (3rd Gen \u2014 Pendant Design)\n\nHowever, Amazon advises that Google\u2019s service is not compatible with the first-generation Fire TV Stick or Fire TV.", "description": "YouTube TV is now available on Amazon\u2019s Fire TV platform.
