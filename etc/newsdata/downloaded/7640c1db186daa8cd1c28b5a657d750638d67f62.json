On Thursday, the Democrats who control the Senate voted to back Sen. Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) as their next president.\n\nLiberals are optimistic that their agenda could be fast-tracked. Education reformers feel empowered. And for the first time in a generation, neither leader is from the Washington suburbs. They must define themselves \u2014 and the legislature\u2019s relationship with Republican Gov. Larry Hogan \u2014 in the shadow of \u201cThe Mikes.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe politics of the chambers have grown more fluid and \u2018small d\u2019 democratic,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who served in the General Assembly for nearly a decade before being elected to Congress in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s an indescribably watershed moment.\u201d\n\nTransfer of power\n\nAD\n\nThe more seismic shift, however, could involve Ferguson, 36, the Senate\u2019s second-youngest member, whom other Democrats described as quiet, collaborative and passionate about policies embraced by the party\u2019s left flank.\n\n\u201cBill Ferguson may be the closest to the opposite of Mike Miller as you can find in personality and temperament,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cHe is subdued, pensive and thoughtful and unfailingly sweet to those he deals with. Mike Miller is this dynamic, charismatic and sometimes volcanic, larger-than-life character out of the pages of a book on the history of old Maryland. Bill Ferguson did Teach for America. Mike Miller invented the national organization to raise money for state legislators.\u201d\n\nRushern L. Baker III (D), a former Prince George\u2019s County executive and member of the General Assembly, said that Miller and Busch were \u201cpeople who could say \u2018This is going to happen,\u2019 and they could make it happen \u2014 especially Miller. They were more powerful than most governors.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnder Jones and Ferguson, he predicted, rank-and-file members \u201cwill have more of a say in what will happen. . . . It won\u2019t be so much top down.\u201d\n\nThrough their representatives, Ferguson and Jones declined to comment for this report.\n\nBut Ferguson has signaled that he could flatten the power structure.\n\n\u201cThere is no one who can replace Mike Miller,\u201d he said in brief remarks after the Democratic caucus vote. \u201cThe only way that we will move forward is if we maximize the skills and talents of each of the 47 members of the Maryland Senate.\u201d\n\nA left-leaning opportunity\n\nThe Senate traditionally has been the more conservative of the two chambers, which each hold veto-proof Democratic majorities. Recent elections ushered in a crop of younger and more liberal lawmakers. But under Miller and Busch, those new rank-and-file members have not exerted significant influence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo much of the work happens in committee,\u201d said Mileah Kromer, a political scientist at Goucher College. \u201cWhen you start to see those committee chairs be progressive, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll see transformational change,\u201d she said.\n\nSome liberal lawmakers are confident that change is on the way. Sen. Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery) said she thinks \u201ccutting-edge legislation\u201d will \u201cget a more favorable hearing and better chances at passage in a Ferguson-led Senate.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the country\u2019s first statewide ban on foam containers, enacted this summer: \u201cThat took three years, and Mike finally said yes, and we were able to get it passed.\u201d\n\nLooking forward, Kagan said she hopes the Senate will fast-track her bill to require all single-stall bathrooms in the state to be designated gender-neutral, a shift she said would aid people with disabilities and the transgender community.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI suspect that Bill Ferguson would find that a no-brainer, and that Mike Miller would find that something that he would have to wrestle with,\u201d Kagan said.\n\nCaryn York, executive director of Job Opportunities Task Force, an advocacy group for low-wage workers, said she\u2019s hopeful but not confident about what lies ahead: \u201cI have been around long enough to know not to get too excited when seats change just because seats change.\u201d\n\nLarry Stafford, is the executive director of Progressive Maryland, an organization that campaigned unsuccessfully to defeat Miller in 2018 and had a hand in defeating some of Miller\u2019s top lieutenants that year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are more possibilities for the progressive movement.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPreparing for battle\n\nBoth Jones and Ferguson are building relationships with Hogan virtually from scratch.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a feeling-out period,\u201d said Doug Mayer, a Republican strategist and former top Hogan staffer. \u201cMike Busch and Mike Miller had known the governor for decades by the time he was elected. While they all fought like hell in public, they also knew when it was time to go behind closed doors and have a drink and make a compromise.\u201d\n\nThose relationships will develop as Democrats ready for an enormous political fight over how to upgrade Maryland\u2019s public education system. Next year, the General Assembly will debate whether to enact a $4 billion plan that Ferguson \u2014 a former teacher who has spent a career working on education reform \u2014 was central in crafting, and that Hogan has derided as \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFerguson\u2019s policy expertise, and his tendency to frame of the issue in terms of moral imperatives, has made him a favorite with education reform advocates, who reportedly cheered each time his name was mentioned at a community forum last week.\n\n\u201cAre children today able to maximize their God-given potential based on the quality of Maryland public schools?\u201d Ferguson asked at a recent public event. \u201cThe answer to that today, despite a lot of our great efforts, is no.\u201d\n\nCiting data that suggest fewer than 40 percent of state high school graduates are ready for jobs or college, he added: \u201cThat is unconscionable \u2014 unconscionable \u2014 in the richest state in the richest country in the world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTodd Eberly, a political scientist at St. Mary\u2019s College, said Miller sometimes throttled more liberal-leaning tax policies that could make it through a Ferguson-led Senate to help pay for the education reforms.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA higher income tax on the wealthy \u2014 or those viewed as wealthy \u2014 is more likely to be on the table,\u201d Eberly said.\n\nShifting influence\n\nMany of Annapolis\u2019s top-flight lobbying firms are led by former Miller staffers who watched up close as he cultivated influence and operated a sprawling Democratic machine. Now, they must adjust to new leaders whose style, top lobbyist Gerard E. Evans said, \u201cwill be much more participatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that Mike and Mike didn\u2019t do that, but they had a key core and everybody else went along,\u201d Evans said. \u201cNow you see young people saying: \u2018I\u2019ve got a voice, too. What am I, chopped liver?\u2019 \u201d\n\nFerguson\u2019s nomination shifted influence from the Washington suburbs, where Miller lived and grew up, to the Baltimore area, which depends heavily on state assistance for everything from schooling to policing to transportation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA Baltimore boy ascending to be Senate president is a good thing for us, obviously,\u201d said Sen. Antonio Hayes (D-Baltimore City), chairman of the city\u2019s Senate delegation. \u201cIt will put our priorities on the table in a meaningful way.\u201d\n\nTimothy Maloney, a former Prince George\u2019s County lawmaker who remains a confidant of many top politicians, including Hogan and Miller, said, \u201cThe big loser in the last year has been the Washington region in general and Prince George\u2019s in particular.\u201d\n\nSenior Democrats from Prince George\u2019s jockeyed to succeed Miller and Busch \u2014 Del. Dereck E. Davis and Sen. Douglas J.J. Peters were each runners-up in their respective caucuses.\n\nBut they could not garner enough support to win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough pill to swallow that we did not capture either chamber,\u201d said Del. Michael A. Jackson (D-Prince George\u2019s), chairman of the county\u2019s House delegation. \u201cWe have to work with our colleagues to make sure our region, the Washington capital region, gets the resources it needs.\u201d", "description": "A new House speaker and Senate president could enable a faster shift to the left and more sharing of power.", "authors": ["Erin Cox", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics", "Ovetta Wiggins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jdnuhYL1cUxdtLCOX2ReUkOXFLg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CF2KRLXY34I6TLEMR3HNFHFG54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
