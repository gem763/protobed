Economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted no increase.\n\nWholesale inflation rose a sharper 0.4% if the volatile categories of food, energy and retail-trade margins are stripped out, but most of the upward pressure in the so-called core rate in August is unlikely to persist.\n\nWholesale inflation has risen 1.8% in the past year, up from 1.7% in the prior month. The yearly rate had touched a seven-year high of 3.4% last summer, however.\n\nRead: U.S. consumers are far from spent and that\u2019s a lifesaver for a wobbly economy\n\nWhat happened: The wholesale cost of services climbed 0.3% last month, including record increases in gambling receipts, guest room rentals, insurance and \u201carrangement of freight and cargo.\u201d\n\nThese spikes are unlikely to be sustained, however, based on past movement in prices.\n\nThe wholesale costs of goods, on the other hand, fell 0.5%. Prices fell for food, liquor, gasoline and other forms of fuel.\n\nThe disparity between goods and services has persisted for much of the past year. Wholesale service costs have risen 2.7% in the last 12 months vs. a slight decline in the cost of goods.\n\nThe increase in the core rate of wholesale inflation over the past 12 months rose to 1.9% in August from 1.7%. Economists prefer core inflation readings because food, gas and trade margins can swing sharply from month to month and mask underlying price trends.\n\nThe wholesale cost of raw and partly finished goods both fell in August and are negative in the past year, suggesting little inflation in the \u201cpipeline.\u201d\n\nRead: For the first time in 11 years, 80% of Americans in their prime are working\n\nBig picture: Inflation fell earlier in the year and is running short of the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, but the decline in prices may be coming to an end. Some measures of inflation indicate prices could be creeping higher again and economists warn that higher tariffs on Chinese goods could feed into inflation also.\n\nThe cost of most goods and services are relatively stable, however, and that will give the Fed more room to cut interest rates if the central bank believes the economy needs a boost. The Fed is widely expected to reduce rates next week as an antidote of sorts to the damage caused by the trade war.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.20% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.19% were set to open modestly higher in Wednesday trades. The PPI report was unlikely to sway investors.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.20% climbed to 1.7%, extended a recent upswing. The yield had fallen below 1.5% earlier this month.\n\n", "description": "The wholesale cost of U.S. goods and services rose slightly in August, but inflation more broadly was still quite low and showed little sign of stirring up...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GF400_ppi_wh_ZG_20180313152109.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
