Earlier Trump called the protests \u201criots\u201d that were a matter for China to deal with.\n\nSunday\u2019s protest was peaceful, compared with some other rallies that have turned violent in recent weeks, with police responding at various times with water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas. Riot police were able to hold their lines in a standoff in the Central MTR (mass transit railway) station, near Sunday\u2019s march, where several protesters were detained after a fire was started at one entrance.\n\n\u201cWith the US locked in a trade war with China at this point in time, it\u2019s a good opportunity for us to show (the United States) how the pro-China groups are also violating human rights in Hong Kong and allowing police brutality,\u201d said Cherry, 26, who works in the financial industry, as protesters marched towards the US consulate nearby.", "description": "", "authors": ["Theguardian.Com World Sep Hong-Kong-Protesters-Call-On-Donald-Trump-To-Liberate-Territory"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
