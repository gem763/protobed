Gold edged higher and Treasury prices rose on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors otherwise broadly remained on the sidelines ahead of an expected interest rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the next round of U.S.-China trade talks on Thursday.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.66%. Chinese shares fell 1.07%, while Hong Kong shares slumped 1.18%.\n\nEuro Stoxx 50 futures were down 0.11%, German DAX futures were down 0.02%, while FTSE futures fell 0.31%.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly a risk-off tone, but I\u2019m surprised the markets are not reacting more,\u201d said Tsutomu Soma, general manager of fixed income business solutions at SBI Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. and other countries have oil reserves, which helps sentiment in a case like this. You also have a lot of positions riding on the Fed meeting.\u201d\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, fell 0.96% to $68.39 per barrel on Tuesday. On Monday, it surged 14.6% for its biggest one-day percentage gain since at least 1988.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were down 1.29% to $62.09 per barrel following a 14.7% surge on Monday, the biggest one-day gain since December 2008.\n\n(graphic: Global oil prices pull back but remain jittery - here)\n\nSaturday\u2019s attack on Saudi oil facilities has halved the kingdom\u2019s oil output, creating the biggest disruption to global oil supplies in absolute terms since the overthrow of the Iranian Shah in 1979, International Energy Agency data show.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has authorized the release of emergency crude stockpiles if needed, which could ease some upward pressure on crude futures.\n\nTrump said on Monday it looked like Iran was behind the attacks but stressed that he did not want to go to war, striking a slightly less bellicose tone than his initial reaction.\n\nIran has rejected U.S. charges that it was behind the attacks. Tension between the two countries was already running high over Iran\u2019s suspected ambitions to assemble nuclear weapons. The strikes in Saudi Arabia are likely to raise regional tensions even further.\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China extended 200 billion yuan ($28.27 billion) of loans from its medium-term lending facility on Tuesday to maintain liquidity but kept the one-year lending rate unchanged at 3.3%.\n\nDisappointment that the PBOC did not lower the one-year lending rate weighed on Chinese shares.\n\nMany analysts expect China to lower benchmark rates for new loans on Friday to keep pace with monetary easing by other central banks.\n\nHong Kong shares headed for their biggest decline in three weeks after Moody\u2019s lowered its outlook for the city\u2019s credit rating due to protests in the Asian financial hub.\n\nThe Chinese-ruled territory has been rocked by more than three months of clashes, with demonstrators angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city\u2019s affairs despite a promise of autonomy.\n\nU.S. stock futures fell 0.08%.
