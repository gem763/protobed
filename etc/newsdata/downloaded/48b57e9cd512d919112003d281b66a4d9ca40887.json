I wanted to spend the rest of life with him and that meant ditching the extra-marital dating.\n\n\u2018I appreciate this is not your conventional love story but they do say that love finds a way \u2013 and it certainly has with Jack and I.\u2019\n\nThey plan to marry next year (Picture: Cavendish Press)\n\nThea and Jack first started dating a year ago when Thea was in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend, and Jack was married.\n\nJack said: \u2018If you had told me that I would meet the woman of my dreams on a cheating site, I never would have believed you.\n\n\u2018But after my first date with Thea, I knew that I never wanted to share her with anyone else. I wanted us both to build a future together as a normal man and wife.\u2019\n\nWhen they first spoke, Thea was dating several men. Using IllicitEncounters.com suited her as other users were also into polygamy.\n\nThea explained: \u2018I had several affairs in this way and thought that I was living the perfect life \u2013 with lots of sex but the stability of having a steady partner back at home.\n\n\u2018For a long time, I convinced myself that this is what I really wanted and that I was enjoying the best of both worlds.\n\n\u2018Then I met Jack and all that changed. I had something much more meaningful and I knew I could not handle the idea of him sleeping with another woman.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a few dates, they cancelled their subscription to the website and became faithful to each other.\n\nAt the moment, Jack is still married to his first wife but will marry Thea as soon as his divorce is finalised.\n\nHe said: \u2018I knew straight away with that I was living a lie and that I had met my life partner.\n\n\u2018Obviously it was slightly more complicated for me because I was married to my wife but we split shortly after that first date with Thea.\n\n\u2018I had had other flings with women I had met on dating sites before I met Thea. It was fun at first but it does get a bit tiring moving from one relationship to the next when you are still married.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t really connect with anyone until I met Thea and then love hit me like a thunderbolt.\u2019\n\nJack insists that he trusts Thea completely and they have been completely faithful since falling in love.\n\n\u2018We cannot bear to be apart so I know where Thea is 24/7 \u2013 we have total trust and cannot wait to build a future together,\u2019 he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThea added: \u2018Just because we have both cheated before doesn\u2019t mean will do it again. It\u2019s different with Jack.\u2019\n\nMORE: Polyamorous married couple get engaged to woman they met on Tinder\n\nMORE: High school sweethearts who fell in love with the same woman set to marry her\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Thea Thorpe and Jack Logan-Beddings, from Nottingham, met through IllicitEncounters.com, a dating website for married people.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89264496_1570719231.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
