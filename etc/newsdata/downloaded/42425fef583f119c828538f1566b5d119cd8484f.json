Television/Getty Images\n\nFrom its very first scene, Friends offered its viewers an odd mix of fixed gender roles and satire on them. Chandler is an indulgent portrait of self-obsessed masculinity, while Monica\u2019s terrible taste in boyfriends recurs as a punchline about women\u2019s inability to understand men.\n\nThough every \u201cfriend\u201d is straight, Friends tried to have its politics both ways by including queer characters who were simultaneously mocked and admired by the other characters. Ross\u2019s ex Carol is certainly meant to seem smarter than him, but Ross makes many more homophobic jokes than Carol gets lines at all. (Ross reflects in the pilot that he should have known Carol was gay because she drank her beer \u201cstraight from the can.\u201d) There is also a large quantity of trans-bashing on Friends, as Chandler bemoans his \u201cgay dad\u201d who seems much closer to a trans woman. In one episode, Chandler\u2019s mom delivers this line to her ex-partner: \u201cDon\u2019t you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?\u201d The laugh track goes wild.\n\nFriends acknowledged the existence of gay people, while not treating them as quite fully human. The same was true for race: There are plenty of actors of color who played bit-parts on the show, but they never made it into the family\u2019s magic circle.\n\nIn a doctoral dissertation titled \u201cI\u2019ll Be There For You\u201d If You Are Just Like Me: An Analysis of Hegemonic Social Structures in Friends, Lisa Marie Marshall argued, \u201cFriends perpetuated dominant ideologies of friendship, gender, race, and class, frequently using humor to communicate these ideas.\u201d Dominant ideology is the TV scholar Jeremy G. Butler\u2019s term for a \u201csystem of beliefs about the world that benefits and supports a society\u2019s ruling class,\u201d and Marshall\u2019s point is that, in the 1990s, the dominant ideology in the U.S. placed a premium on whiteness, heterosexuality, leisure, luxurious apartments, female beauty, and men who make jokes at other people\u2019s expense. Friends appeared on the surface to question those ideological demands, but its heroes promoted a kind of aspirational existence that was in fact deeply conformist.\n\nDespite its flaws, the twentieth anniversary of Friends occasioned a flurry of positive reminiscences. In The Guardian, Anne T. Donahue called it \u201cthe best ever show about 20-somethings.\u201d In Slate, Willa Paskin wrote, \u201cThe pilot of Friends was not particularly well-reviewed, but it plays well in hindsight.\u201d She went on: \u201cUnlike with so much contemporary TV, there is no barrier to entry with Friends.\u201d\n\nBut Friends is not popular because it is uncomplicated\u2014it just seems that way because we\u2019re so used to it. When I asked Molly why she\u2019d chosen Friends as her TV companion of choice during the first few weeks of her child\u2019s life, she sounded a similar note to Paskin. \u201cAt the time, I thought: This is the most basic thing I could have chosen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was just so easy to watch!\u201d It\u2019s that very ease\u2014the ubiquity and obviousness of the cultural juggernaut that hides in plain sight\u2014that makes Friends difficult to wrap your arms around.\n\nWhen you see the same situations acted out on television hundreds of times over the course of a quarter-decade, the fiction writes itself deep into the code of your brain. Globally, Friends is as impossible to avoid as Coca Cola. Both the story and the values of Friends have become a part of our culture the same way that Mount Rushmore came to define the American landscape: You just can\u2019t make it go away. It\u2019s hegemony in motion.\n\nAfter long weeks of watching the show and pondering its dubious joys, only one explanation for Friends\u2019 endurance accounts for both its cultural conservatism and its sparkling, juvenile humor.\n\nFriends is about adults whose bonds of friendship surpass every other kind of relationship in their life, and which they prioritize over all else. Their love for one another is unconditional. Each episode introduces some kind of complication to the group dynamic, and again and again the friends resolve the conflict and return to the bliss of mutual love and support.\n\nThe only common factor in all of the statistics about Friends\u2019 popularity is age. Young people are the lifeblood of the Friends audience. For those between the ages of 13 and 25, friendship is everything. It\u2019s an all-consuming drama that crowds out all other concerns, including the political. Lurking beneath that obsession with friendship dynamics, however, is the subtler adolescent fear of leaving home and having to find affection on one\u2019s own terms, out in the cold, grown-up world. Friends dramatizes a fantasy of permanent, positive love between attractive adults whose problems (financial, professional) always shake out in the wash. It\u2019s a vision of adulthood that conforms to the emotional requirements of teenagers (not to mention the grown-ups they will become) like a tailored suit fits a gentleman.\n\nThere\u2019s a funny moment on \u201cThe One With Rachel\u2019s Sister,\u201d when somebody knocks on the purple apartment door (it turns out to be Reese Witherspoon). Phoebe looks around the room and counts everybody in attendance. You see the confusion spread as the gang realize that \u201cthey\u201d\u2014Joey, Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, Ross, and Rachel\u2014are all present.
