The airline said that it looks to fly to the 'most popular destinations for our customers' so it could be that if demand is there, the airline looks to bring back flights to Sharm el Sheikh although it has not confirmed anything yet.\n\nA spokesperson told us: \"We regularly review our schedule to ensure that we are flying to the most popular destinations for our customers.\"\n\n(Image: Geoff Moore/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nFollowing the news of the lifted restrictions, the FCO has already updated its Egypt travel advice explaining that they \"no longer advise against all but essential travel by air to/from Sharm el Sheikh\".\n\nIt says that an estimated 415,000 British nationals visited Egypt in 2018, with most visits being trouble free.\n\nHowever, the authority still warns Brits that 'terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt'.\n\n(Image: Mohamed El-Dakhakhny/Sipa/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nAs part of its travel advice it explains: \"Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt. Although most attacks occur in North Sinai, there is a risk of terrorist attacks across the country.\n\n\"Attacks could be indiscriminate, affecting Egyptian security forces, religious sites, large public gatherings and places visited by foreigners.\n\n\"There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan and the Christmas period (including Coptic Christmas), when terrorist groups have sometimes called for attacks.\n\n\"Terrorist attacks have occurred over local holiday weekends. Terrorists have attacked tourists in Egypt in the past. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks targeting Coptic Christians from extremists linked to Daesh-Sinai in Egypt.\"", "description": "UK firms such as easyJet and TUI are considering their options now that Sharm el-Sheikh flight restrictions have been lifted", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty", "Geoff Moore Rex Shutterstock", "Mohamed El-Dakhakhny Sipa Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20672131.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Exotic-beach-with-parasols-and-bougainvillea-Sharm-el-Sheikh-Egypt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
