(See the video above beginning at 21:48.)\n\nThe speech was a startling revelation of how deeply the top lawman in the nation is tied to his Catholicism as he lashed a recent New Jersey law requiring an LGBTQ curriculum in public schools to support civil rights. He complained that laws are being \u201cused as a battering ram to break down traditional moral values.\u201d\n\nBarr said that secular militants, including \u201cso-called progressives,\u201d are mobilized in an \u201corganized destruction\u201d of religion. He derided the rising new values as \u201cmere sentimentality.\u201d Barr vowed that his Justice Department will fight for the \u201cmost cherished of all our American liberties: the freedom to live according to our faith.\u201d\n\nBecause of the decreasing influence of Judeo-Christian traditions, Barr insisted, \u201calong with the wreckage of the family, we are seeing record levels of depression and mental illness, dispirited young people, soaring suicide rates, increasing numbers of angry and alienated young males, an increase in senseless violence and a deadly drug epidemic.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI won\u2019t dwell on the bitter results of the new secular age. Suffice it to say that the campaign to destroy the traditional moral order has ... brought with it immense suffering and misery.\u201d\n\nBarr called Judeo-Christian moral standards ... the \u201cultimate utilitarian rules for human conduct ... They are like God\u2019s instruction manual for the best running of man and the best operation for human society,\u201d he added.\n\nBarr said religion has been under \u201cincreasing\u201d assault in America over the last 50 years and that \u201cground zero\u201d for attacks on religion now are \u201cthe schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Catholics,\u201d he added, \u201cwe know that the first thing we have to do ... is to ensure that we are putting our principles into practice.\u201d", "description": "\"Judeo-Christian moral standards are like God\u2019s instruction manual for ... the best operation for human society,\" said the attorney general.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da15c30200000da065000f5.jpeg?cache=eywbcplbdv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
