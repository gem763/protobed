It was a savings account we nicknamed \"Honeymoon July 2019\" and we eagerly and diligently put money into it each month.\n\nTo some people, our choice might seem extravagant. We\u2019re a millennial couple and like many in our cohort, student loans are a scary line item on our marital ledger.\n\nThe decision to take a honeymoon, even while paying off debt, didn\u2019t faze me at first. I'm a personal finance author, and my husband and I decided very consciously that travel (actual personal travel, not just going to other people\u2019s weddings) is a financial priority in our lives. Besides, we had decided to delay the trip to better align with our 2019 schedules.\n\nThen, after more than a year of saving up for our blissful getaway, I did the math and panicked.\n\nStop saving for retirement: Millennials, you've got this all wrong.\n\nJuul shake-up: Juul CEO resigns, vaping company suspends advertising as crisis continues\n\nAfter getting married, we\u2019d been aggressively paying off my husband\u2019s student debt with our combined incomes, paying nearly four times the monthly minimum payment each month. We also had socked away monthly sums in our honeymoon fund. The way the timelines were playing out, our honeymoon savings could pay off the remaining student debt within the first year of our marriage, leaving us debt-free.\n\nThe realization put me into a tailspin, because what kind of personal finance author would I be if we went on a fancy honeymoon instead of paying off the remainder of my husband\u2019s student debt?\n\nThe danger of black-and-white\n\nSo much of prevailing rhetoric in the personal finance industry demonizes all forms of debt and has turned it into a morality issue. But there\u2019s a fundamental problem with telling people to eschew all of life\u2019s luxuries (big or small) in the quest to be debt-free.\n\n\u201cBecause crash diets end at the buffet line,\u201d says H. Jude Boudreaux, CFP, partner and senior financial planner at The Planning Center. He thinks the black-and-white argument of denying yourself breaks while paying off debt is a false choice.\n\n\u201cI think the negatives stack up more than the interest,\u201d Boudreaux says. \u201cI think you can have a balanced way of looking at the things ...We can build a strategy that might take a couple more years and cost us a bit more in interest, but is much more do-able from a life standpoint.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also much easier to proclaim a one-size-fits-all financial mandate when you aren\u2019t taking a holistic view of someone\u2019s everyday life.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many personal finance gurus also work with clients one-on-one and look at all of their goals and look at their budget and help them weigh the pros and cons,\u201d says Pamela Capalad, founder and financial planner of Brunch & Budget. \u201cThere is no absolute right or wrong when it comes to things that pay down debt.\u201d\n\nFinancial therapist Amanda Clayman acknowledges we need to be aware of the financial consequences of our decisions. But she also points out that our goal as humans isn\u2019t just to optimize our financial lives.\n\n\u201cPeople live in a fantasy and are projecting that everything in their lives will be right when certain financial conditions are met,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen I looked at our savings and goals, the numbers told me to ditch the honeymoon and become debt-free. My emotions said otherwise.\n\nThe right emotional choice\n\nSo we took our honeymoon. I saw the thousands of dollars spent on a two-week trip together as an investment in our relationship.\n\nHokey as it sounds, we desperately needed time to reconnect after what our first year of marriage had served up: the death of our first dog, the adoption of a second, a move, the release of my second book and a nine-city book tour that took over six weeks, and my husband picking up every overtime possibility that he could.\n\nOn our honeymoon we put away our laptops, cell phones and work obligations and focused on each other.\n\nUsing our honeymoon fund to pay off the student loan debt would\u2019ve only moved up our debt freedom timeline by about eight months. I\u2019m able to sleep well at night knowing the interest that will accrue during those eight months will be money well spent: It's a down payment on a strong foundation for our marriage.\n\nErin Lowry is the author of \"Broke Millennial Takes On Investing\" and \"Broke Millennial: Stop Scraping By and Get Your Financial Life Together.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: The best way to pay off debt may not mean denying yourself", "description": "What kind of personal finance author would I be if my husband and I went on a fancy honeymoon instead of paying off his student debt?", "authors": ["Erin Lowry", "Special To Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yQED3FZ_6kwoOn6.1UH1Dw--~B/aD00NTA7dz0zNjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/cb2d578c-7636-4a35-8ef6-c92d302325a9/dcc80cbf-5f9e-5c87-9ad7-8f224b65f4b4/data_3_0.jpg?s=a74c96f43d38484e045276607481283d&c=b0628f647e541c4523324e0d517d1d2c&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
