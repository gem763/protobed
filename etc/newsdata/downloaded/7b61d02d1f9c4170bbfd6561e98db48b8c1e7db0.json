Prosecutors questioned Mr. Ferrand until late in the night Wednesday.\n\nMr. Ferrand is a close aide of Mr. Macron and was among the first lawmakers to join his new political party in 2016.\n\nA previous probe targeting Mr. Ferrand\u2019s time at Mutuelles de Bretagne was dismissed in 2017. The new probe was triggered by a complaint filed by an anticorruption group.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nMr. Ferrand, 57, said he was unalarmed since the plaintiff didn\u2019t bring any new evidence to the case. He added that he was determined to stay in his job.\n\nMr. Ferrand has always denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe fresh probe is a setback for Mr. Macron who has pledged to end nepotism and favoritism in his political ranks following months of at times violent yellow-vest protests. Public anger about the perceived privileges of the country\u2019s elite drove thousands of protesters to weekly protests, bringing the government to its knees.\n\nGovernment spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye said Thursday that Mr. Macron remained confident in Mr. Ferrand.\n\n\u201cUntil proven otherwise, he is presumed innocent,\u201d said Ms. Ndiaye. \u201cHe\u2019s a loyal, upright man who has had, I believe, an exemplary political career.\u201d\n\nAccusations against Mr. Ferrand surfaced in 2017 after weekly Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9 reported that Mr. Ferrand\u2019s girlfriend won the rental contract from Mutuelles de Bretagne in 2011 when Mr. Ferrand was in charge of the insurer.\n\nOther French media reported Mr. Ferrand continued to work as a consultant for Mutuelles de Bretagne while serving as a lawmaker and participating in parliamentary debates about changes to France\u2019s health-insurance industry.\n\nWeeks later, judges in the city of Brest, where Mutuelles de Bretagne is based, launched an investigation into Mr. Ferrand. He resigned as housing minister but stayed on as lawmaker. Judges dropped the case later that year.\n\nMr. Ferrand became speaker of the National Assembly in September 2018.\n\nWrite to Noemie Bisserbe at noemie.bisserbe@wsj.com", "description": "French prosecutors have opened a probe into the past business activity of the speaker of the National Assembly, muddying efforts by President Emmanuel Macron to clean up politics in the wake of the yellow-vest crisis.", "authors": ["Noemie Bisserbe", "Noemie.Bisserbe Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106494/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
