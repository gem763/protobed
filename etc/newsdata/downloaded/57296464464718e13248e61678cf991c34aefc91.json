That would allow him to stay at the company he built into one of the country\u2019s most valuable startups, but inject fresh leadership to pursue an IPO that would bring We the cash it needs to keep up its torrid growth.\n\nThe company burned through more than $2 billion in 2018 and analysts have projected that on its current path We will run through what it has on hand sometime next year.\n\nAny attempted coup is a gamble: Neumann still has allies among the directors and the ability to fire the entire board thanks to shares he controls that carry extra votes.
