Hunter Biden and his daughter participated in a few public events there with Mr. Biden.\n\nThe conservative author Peter Schweizer claimed that Hunter Biden used the trip to secure a deal with the Bank of China. That allegation has been echoed by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies, and by the president himself on Thursday.\n\nBut a lawyer for Hunter Biden has said that he did not conduct any business related to the China investment fund on that trip, and that he was never an equity owner in the fund while his father was vice president. Hunter Biden later acquired a 10 percent interest in the entity that oversees the fund, but to date has not received any money from the arrangement, according to the lawyer.\n\nMr. Trump on Thursday said he had not personally asked President Xi for assistance. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about because I\u2019m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks Thursday, the president said Hunter Biden was not qualified for that sort of business dealing, noting that he had been discharged from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine. \u201cHe got kicked out of the Navy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAll of a sudden he\u2019s getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a payoff.\u201d\n\nIn Ukraine, Hunter Biden served on the board of an energy company making as much as $50,000 a month. As vice president, his father pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor whose office had oversight of investigations into the oligarch who owned that energy company. By the time the elder Mr. Biden acted, there was no public evidence that the prosecutors\u2019 office was actively pursuing any of the investigations.\n\nBut the oligarch\u2019s allies say the prosecutor continued to use the threat of prosecution to try to solicit bribes from the oligarch and his team. The prosecutor was widely believed to be overlooking corruption in Ukraine and his ouster was favored by the United States, European leaders and international institutions. No evidence has emerged that Mr. Biden, who was carrying out Obama administration policy, was motivated by his son\u2019s business interests.", "description": "President Trump made a similar, but private, request of the president of Ukraine, an episode that has sparked an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Eileen Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/us/politics/03dc-prexy-promo/03dc-prexy-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
