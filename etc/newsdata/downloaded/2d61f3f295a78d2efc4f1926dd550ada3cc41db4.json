In 2017, CNBC estimated Aldi made over $13 billion in the US alone.\n\nLittle is known about the Albrechts. They don't speak to the press or attend openings of their stores. According to a German newspaper, the family does not own vacation homes, private jets, or yachts, but instead have chosen to live in seclusion, keeping just a couple thousand euros in their bank account.\n\nBut now, according to a recent report from The Guardian, the family is feuding after one of the founder's wives tried to cut her daughter-in-law and five grandkids out of the family business.", "description": "The notoriously frugal Albrecht family turned a thrifty corner store into an Aldi empire and built a $53.5 billion family fortune.", "authors": ["Meira Gebel", "Rachel Askinasi"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d702cee2e22af755a0c5e87-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
