Wednesday\u2019s charges add the allegation that their drugs led to Miller\u2019s death.\n\nMiller, 26, died of an accidental overdose of the powerful opioid fentanyl, along with cocaine and alcohol. Fentanyl has contributed to an epidemic of opioid abuse in the U.S. that has claimed thousands of lives, including those of other musicians, such as Prince.\n\nThe men face a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in federal prison and the potential for life without parole if convicted of either of the charges related to Miller\u2019s death.\n\nAll have been arrested in recent weeks and remain in custody, and none has entered a plea.\n\nAttorneys for Pettit and Walter declined comment. It\u2019s unclear whether Reavis has a lawyer.\n\nPettit and Walter, who was also charged with being a felon in possession of ammunition, were scheduled to be arraigned on the new charges on Oct. 10. Reavis, who was arrested last week in Arizona, does not have an arraignment date set yet.\n\nThe indictment alleges the men continued to distribute drugs through August 2019.\n\nMiller's beats and rhymes, with their frank expressions of drug use and depression, made him a beloved and respected figure among fans, including some of the biggest names in hip-hop.\n\nThe Pittsburgh native, whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was in a two-year relationship with Ariana Grande that ended earlier in 2018. After his death, the pop star posted a loving video of him on her Instagram page and released a song, \"Thank U Next,\" that affectionately mentioned him.\n\nThe indictment alleged that Walter supplied the fentanyl and cocaine that Pettit sold to Miller and that Reavis, who lived in the Los Angeles area until earlier this year, acted as a middleman for the fentanyl sale.\n\nPettit on Sept. 5, 2018 sold Miller cocaine, Xanax and 10 blue pills that appeared to be oxycodone but contained fentanyl after the two had exchanged text messages a day earlier, according to the indictment.\n\nIn the texts, Miller proclaimed his love for oxycodone, or \"percs\" for the brand name Percocet, and also asks for \"bars\" of Xanax and a \"ball\" of cocaine, according to a previous court filing. Miller also asked Pettit, \u201cWhen can u get em?\u201d according to previous court filings.\n\nTwo days later, Miller\u2019s assistant found him dead at his Los Angeles home.\n\nIn another set of messages included in the indictment, Reavis worried in a text sent in June about undercover police buying drugs.\n\n\u201cPeople have been dying from fake blues left and right,\u201d the message said, \u201cyou better believe law enforcement is using informant informants and undercover to buy them on the street so they can start putting ppl in prison for life for selling fake pills.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Brian Melley contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton/", "description": "Three men arrested during the investigation into rapper Mac Miller\u2019s deadly overdose last year have now been charged with providing the drugs that killed him, U.S. prosecutors said Wednesday.
