(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\nThe heartwarming story of Iowa State fan Carson King\u2019s request for beer money and an ensuing million-dollar children\u2019s hospital donation took a turn Tuesday.\n\nKing apologized Tuesday night after the Des Moines Register found what it said were \u201ctwo racist jokes\u201d posted to King\u2019s Twitter account in 2012. King, 24, was 16 at the time of those two tweets.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFrom the Register:\n\nA routine background check of King's social media revealed two racist jokes, one comparing black mothers to gorillas and another making light of black people killed in the holocaust. The joke tweets date back to 2012, when King was a 16-year-old high school student.\n\nWhen asked about the tweets, King was remorseful and thanked the Register for pointing them out, saying they made him \"sick.\" He has since deleted them.\n\nKing, who has helped raise over $1 million for the University of Iowa\u2019s Stead Children\u2019s Hospital, held a press conference to make his apology on Tuesday night ahead of the newspaper\u2019s profile, which was published at approximately 9:30 p.m. CT. King said the decision to publicly apologize was his and that he was informed of the old tweets in an interview with the paper\n\nThe Des Moines Register has been nothing but kind in all of their coverage, and I appreciate the reporter pointing out the post to me. I want everyone to understand that this was my decision to publicly address the posts and apologize. I believe that is the right thing to do. \u2014 Carson King (@CarsonKing2) September 25, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nKing became a viral star after he held up a sign requesting money for Busch Light with the name of his Venmo account during ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d on Sept. 14 at Iowa State. He received thousands of dollars and, once he received over $6,000, decided to donate the money to the children\u2019s hospital.\n\nHis gesture got him publicity and thanks from both Busch and Venmo, who said they would match the donation from King. As people kept sending money to King\u2019s Venmo account, the total set to go to the Stead Children\u2019s Hospital topped $1 million with the matching donations.\n\nAfter King\u2019s apology Tuesday night, Anheuser-Busch said it would honor its matching donation but would no longer associate itself with King. It had even put his face on some special edition cans of Busch Light.\n\n\u201cCarson King had multiple social media posts that do not align with our values as a brand or as a company and we will have no further association with him. We are honoring our commitment by donating more than $350,000 to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.\u201d\n\nHow and why did the Register find the tweets?\n\nThe Register posted a statement to Facebook late Tuesday night that it found the tweets during a \u201croutine background check on King that included a review of publicly visible social media posts, a standard part of a reporter\u2019s work on a profile.\u201d\n\nThe paper added that it deliberated on whether it should include a reference to the tweets in the profile of King.\n\n\u201cEventually, Register editors decided we would include the information, but at the bottom of the story,\u201d the paper\u2019s statement said. \u201cWe thought we should be transparent about what we had found, but not highlight it at the top of the story or as a separate story. It was planned as a few paragraphs toward the bottom of the profile.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the decision about how to use this information was pre-empted when King held a news conference to discuss his tweets and express his remorse. The news conference was covered by local television stations, which first reported on the racist posts and King\u2019s remorse. After those stories aired, Busch Light\u2019s parent company announced it would honor its pledge to the children\u2019s hospital but would sever future ties with King.\u201d\n\nRegister reporter investigated for old tweets\n\nAfter the Register\u2019s revelation of King\u2019s old tweets became public, reporter Aaron Calvin\u2019s Twitter feed became a point of scrutiny. And now he\u2019s under investigation by the Register for offensive and racist tweets from years ago.\n\nFrom the Washington Post:\n\nBetween 2010 and 2013, Calvin published tweets that used a racist slur for black people, made light of abusing women, used the word \u201cgay\u201d as a pejorative, and mocked the legalization of same-sex marriage by saying he was \u201ctotally going to marry a horse.\u201d The Register\u2019s statement on Twitter was soon flooded with screen shots of the reporter\u2019s offensive comments.\n\nCalvin tweeted an apology for the old tweets overnight and subsequently protected his Twitter account. The paper didn\u2019t comment any further to the Post about the investigation into Calvin\u2019s tweets other than noting that it had publicly stated the reporter was under investigation for his old tweets.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Carson King helped raise over $1 million for the University of Iowa's children's hospital, thanks to his beer money sign on \"College GameDay.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hRS3uefBAT1gbQVFxa5DlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03NTYuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o2WH3Xk3xFpyxAq0_fkXnw--~B/aD0yOTQ3O3c9NDk5MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/44d7cd40-df97-11e9-bb5f-7bb33a5fb2c7", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
