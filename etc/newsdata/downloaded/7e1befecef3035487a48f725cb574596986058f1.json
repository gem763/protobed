All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this release that address future activities, events, developments or financial performance are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cfuture\u201d or \u201ccontinue\u201d or the negative thereof or similar variations.
