The classrooms are littered with no-crease clips, the lectures are taught by world-renowned hairstylists and makeup artists, and everything is demonstrated on the most symmetrical faces in the field. We did some studying over the weekend, and we\u2019re letting you copy our homework. Here are five lessons we\u2019ve learned so far.\n\n1. Fake Freckles Like You Fake Your Brows\n\nBella Hadid with fake freckles at Brandon Maxwell. Photo: Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nIn 2019, faking freckles is nothing new. It\u2019s a great way to distract from pimples or make it look like you\u2019ve been getting a cute amount of sun damage without actually putting your skin in harm\u2019s way. The latter is the exact role they served backstage at Brandon Maxwell, where lead artist Tom Pecheux dotted supermodels\u2019 noses and cheeks to complete the look\u2019s \u201cwhen the beauty comes back from the beach\u201d vibe. Instead of using the expected eyeliner for the job, Pecheaux cocktailed multiple shades of MAC Veluxe Brow Liner to get a more realistic effect before dabbing his handiwork with his fingers to melt it into the skin.\n\n2. Dry Your Hair to Get the Wet Look\n\nWet-looking hair at Prabal Gurung.

The hair at Prabal Gurung looked extremely hydrated, but lead stylist Laurent Philippon used zero water to create the effect. \u201cIf you just wet the hair, this look doesn\u2019t work on a lot of textures, so we\u2019re using product only.\u201d Philippon started on models\u2019 dry hair, saturating the roots with Bumble and bumble Thickening Spray, then hitting everything with a Dyson Supersonic hair dryer. Next, everything got re-saturated with Sumo Liquid Wax + Finishing Spray (seriously, don\u2019t hold back), and scrunched with a little Sumogel (\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely gelly texture, not wet at all\u201d). Right before showtime, Phillippon sprayed even more Bb. Curl Luminous Oil Spray to amp it all up. \u201cIf you use it an extreme way, it really makes the hair look wet.\u201d Have at it.\n\n3. Don\u2019t Make Beyonc\u00e9 Mad\n\nVery good highlighter at Tommy x Zendaya.

He doesn\u2019t bake, he cooks. \u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary unless you\u2019re on CNN like all day,\u201d he explains. Cook by using a smaller, fluffy brush, dipping it in highlighter, dusting it off, and applying in the T-zone only.\n\nHe also doesn\u2019t love it when you can see highlighter when you\u2019re looking at someone straight-on. \u201cYou should only see it when someone is turning their head,\u201d placed in the C shape around the bones of the eye, otherwise it\u2019s distracting and \u201cweird,\u201d he says. Personally, he favors warm and gold tones like Lancome Dual Finish Highlighter in Luminous Gold. Since he is Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s makeup artist, by additive properties, she must not be a huge fan of these beauty pet peeves either, and you wouldn\u2019t want to upset Beyonc\u00e9 now, would you?\n\n4. Square Off Your Eyeliner\n\nSquare wings at Helmut Lang.

Lead artist Susie Sobol created bold, punk-inspired liner looks in neon greens, yellows, pinks, and good ol\u2019 black. Each winged out and upward, sure, but in a thick, way-more-attainable square shape that you can (and should) just draw with a kohl pencil. Another plus of this liner shape is that it looks great with the light and see-through-lensed sunglasses you\u2019ll be wearing next spring, because Sobol dreamed up the neon-liner lineup with them in mind. But if you\u2019re still a black-liner truther, she recommends running Code 8 Precision liquid liner into the lash line and beyond for maximum impact. \u201cIt\u2019s super, super, super, black and has a little bit of a shine to it.\u201d\n\n5. Try Some Eye Blush\n\nFrom left: Eye blush at Tadashi Shoji. Photo: Pietro D\u2019Aprano/FilmMagic Eye blush at Jason Wu.

Photo: JP YIM/Getty Images for NYFW: The Shows\n\nIf Euphoria or life in general is making you want to experiment more with makeup, try eye blush. Makeup artists like Daniel Martin and Diane Kendal have taken to applying blush around the eyes. At Tadashi Shoji, Martin\u2019s look was a light take on Harajuku girls, and Kendal was inspired by Jason Wu\u2019s fascination with Irving Penn flowers. Using Maybelline\u2019s Lemonade Craze palette, Kendal used a fluffy brush (she suggests a foundation brush) to pat and tap a light pink shade all over the eye, going from the eyelid to under the eye. It kind of looks like you have a haze of cotton candy decorating your eye, which is better than a dark circle.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Here are five interesting beauty tips we learned from the expert makeup artists and hairstylist backstage at New York Fashion Week Spring 2020.", "authors": ["Kathleen Hou", "Erica Smith"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/09/beauty/9-beauty-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
