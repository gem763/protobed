They\u2019re hardly Posh and Becks. They are shameless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They have shown no remorse to us during or since the trial. We\u2019ve never heard anything from them. Surely, as human beings they should sympathise with us losing such a huge part of our lives.\n\n\u2018Instead, they seem to be more worried about tainting their reputations.\u2019\n\nMrs Makki\u2019s daughter Jade Akoum, 28, added: \u2018They can have all the money in the world and use a PR company but they can\u2019t change the fact their son killed Yousef and was troubled.\u201d\n\nThe family confirmed they would be \u2018exploring all avenues to ensure justice for Yousef\u2019.\n\nYousef had won a scholarship to \u00a313,000-a-year Manchester Grammar School, where he excelled academically.\n\nThe teenager acquitted of murdering Yousef Makki in a leafy Cheshire village can now be named as Joshua Molnar (Picture: PA)\n\nMolnar was cleared of the murder and manslaughter (Picture: PA)\n\nMolnar, Yousef (previously \u2018Boy A\u2019) and a third youth, \u2018Boy B\u2019 who still cannot be identified, had all been smoking cannabis together before the latter suggested getting \u00a345 more from a dealer.\n\nProsecutors claimed the plan was to rob the dealer when he arrived, but Molnar and the second defendant were both cleared of attempted robbery.\n\nJurors heard Molnar was \u2018jumped\u2019 at the meeting point, prompting Yousef and the other boy to flee and leave Molnar to take a beating.\n\nThat attack was then the catalyst for the subsequent argument between the pals and the fatal stabbing of Yousef.\n\nMolnar had become fixated with knives, living out \u2018idiotic fantasies\u201d of being a middle-class gangster, his trial heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe keen rugby player admitted perverting the course of justice by lying to police about what had happened and possession of a flick knife.\n\nMolnar, who had been at one time a pupil at Ellesmere College, a \u00a333,000-a-year boarding school in Shropshire, will be released from custody next March.\n\nMolnar with mother Stephanie, who said he \u2018will have to live with the responsibility of his role in this for the rest of his life\u2019 (Picture: PA)\n\nThe second defendant was cleared of perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police \u2013 but also admitted possession of a flick knife. He was given a four-month detention order.\n\nIn a statement to The Sunday Times, Joshua\u2019s mum Stephanie Molnar, who employed PR firm MC2 to handle press inquiries, said: \u2018I cannot imagine what Yousef\u2019s parents and family must be going through as they try to come to terms with this.\n\n\u2018Joshua fully accepts responsibility for Yousef\u2019s death in the act of self-defence and the impact of this acceptance is massive.\n\n\u2018He will have to live with the responsibility of his role in this for the rest of his life.\u2019\n\nA pre-inquest hearing into the death of Yousef is scheduled for October 18 at Manchester Coroner\u2019s Court.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
