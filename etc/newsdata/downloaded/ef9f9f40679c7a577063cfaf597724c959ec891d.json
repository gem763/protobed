Those charges stem from his orchestration of one of the largest intelligence leaks in American history, which exposed secret American spying programs, sparked a national dialogue about government snooping and eventually led to legislation that curtailed the use of some spying tools.\n\nSnowden, who\u2019s been living in exile in Russia for the last six years, has been doing a number of media appearances to promote his new book, titled \"Permanent Record,\" which was released worldwide on Tuesday in coordination with Constitution Day in the U.S.\n\nThe suit also names the book\u2019s publishers, Macmillan and Holtzbrink, as relief defendants, though DOJ said it is only suing them nominally \u201cto ensure that no funds are transferred to Snowden, or at his direction,\u201d while the case is litigated.\n\nThe complaint also cites a number of paid speeches Snowden has given while holed up in Russia, where he's been living under an asylum agreement since leaving the U.S. in 2013.\n\n\u201cIntelligence information should protect our nation, not provide personal profit,\u201d said G. Zachary Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, which will handle the suit along with DOJ\u2019s civil division. \u201cThis lawsuit will ensure that Edward Snowden receives no monetary benefits from breaching the trust placed in him.\u201d\n\nDOJ asserted that it has grounds to seize Snowden\u2019s profits under the precedent set by the 1980 Supreme Court decision in Snepp v. United States, which involved a similar situation where a former CIA contractor was sued for breach of contract after not submitting a book manuscript for pre-publication review.\n\nSnowden was defiant Tuesday, tweeting out a link to purchase the book on Amazon and writing: \u201cThe government of the United States has just announced a lawsuit over my memoir, which was just released today worldwide. This is the book the government does not want you to read.\u201d\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which is challenging the constitutionality of the pre-publication review process, backed up Snowden.\n\n\"This book contains no government secrets that have not been previously published by respected news organizations,\" said Ben Wizner, an attorney for Snowden who runs the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. \"Had Mr. Snowden believed that the government would review his book in good faith, he would have submitted it for review.\"", "description": "The agency filed a lawsuit on Tuesday alleging Snowden violated a nondisclosure agreement he signed while working with the government.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko", "Laurens Cerulus", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1175304595-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
