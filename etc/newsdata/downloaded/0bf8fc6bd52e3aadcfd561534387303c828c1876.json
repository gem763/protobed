But equally I don\u2019t want to rule anybody out of that either. Jonny\u2019s a fine player. Potentially, yes (he could be picked for South Africa). It\u2019s obviously something that myself, Joe [Root], the selectors and everybody have got to talk about. We\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to talking about South Africa but, yes, I can\u2019t see why he couldn\u2019t come back into the frame.\u201d", "description": "Chris Silverwood, the new England head coach, has opened the door for Jonny Bairstow to make a quick return to the Test side.", "authors": ["Nick Hoult", "Cricket News Correspondent", "Michael Vaughan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000210599426-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_4lZL6XGyKd1IzVfh-3zqqHyM6nv2oAAiNuWpQaAT3M.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
