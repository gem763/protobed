The last time before that was 1935, a matchup of 10-0 teams.\n\n\u201cFrom a coach\u2019s perspective, we\u2019re improved over where we were last year, and we\u2019re playing a better style of football, just playing harder on both sides of the ball,\u201d SMU coach Sonny Dykes said. \u201cI think people are starting to appreciate the fact that we know our guys play hard, and it\u2019s an entertaining brand of football, and we\u2019re having some success.\u201d\n\nTCU (2-0) is coming off a three-touchdown road win against Big Ten team Purdue, which followed an early open date for the Frogs. They have the Big 12\u2019s top defense, allowing 209.5 total yards per game.\n\nSMU, which has been overwhelmed by TCU in recent meetings, comes in with wins over Arkansas State, North Texas and Texas State. The Mustangs had 639 total yards against the FCS Bobcats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to play the best football team we\u2019ve played against,\u201d Dykes said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious when you turn the film on, just in terms of their talent, and the way they performed Saturday against Purdue was really impressive. \u2026 I think our guys will be excited to measure ourselves against a very good program.\u201d\n\nDykes is in his second season on the Hilltop following a brief stint as an offensive analyst at TCU. He has 65 players who are first-year Mustangs.\n\n\u201cThe transfer portal has really helped \u2026 they\u2019ve changed their roster really,\u201d said Gary Patterson, in his 19th full season as TCU\u2019s head coach.\n\nAmong the SMU newcomers is former Texas quarterback Shane Buechele, one of seven graduate transfers and the American Athletic Conference leader with 871 yards passing. He was 0-2 against TCU while with the Longhorns, completing only 37 of 83 passes (45 for 472 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions in those games.\n\n\u201cFor them, he\u2019s giving them consistency,\u201d Patterson said, when asked about Buechele at SMU. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that has played in big ball games and he checks into things how he\u2019s supposed to.\u201d\n\nFRESH QB\n\nGraduate transfer Alex Delton started TCU\u2019s first two games, but true freshman Max Duggan entered on the third series both times. Duggan was in for 11 of the Frogs\u2019 14 possessions against Purdue, including all after halftime. When asked if there could be a change in the way the Frogs use their quarterbacks this week, Patterson responded \u201cmaybe.\u201d\n\nLOPSIDED SKILLET\n\nTCU has won by an average margin of four touchdowns while winning the last seven games in the series known as the Battle for the Iron Skillet between two schools 40 miles apart. The Horned Frogs are 15-2 against SMU since 2001, the first season the two teams weren\u2019t in the same conference. The only years they haven\u2019t played since 1925 were 1987 and 1988 after SMU\u2019s penalties, and 2006.\n\nWHAT A RUSH\n\nBoth SMU and TCU had two 100-yard rushers last week. The Mustangs\u2019 390 yards rushing against Texas State were the most since 1985. True freshman TJ McDaniel, who could still be redshirted, ran eight times for 159 yards and three TDs (10, 39 and 42 yards), while Xavier Jones had 108 yards and matched the national lead with his seventh rushing TD. TCU piled up 346 yards against Purdue, when Darius Anderson had 179 and Sewo Olonilua 106.\n\nLONE VOTE\n\nWhile the Mustangs didn\u2019t get any votes in the AP Top 25 this week, they got a vote from one of the 65 coaches that rank the teams for another poll. Dykes guessed that maybe the vote came from Patterson.\n\n\u201cA little showmanship, you know how that stuff goes,\u201d SMU\u2019s coach said.\n\nWhen asked if it was, Patterson only said, \u201ccould\u2019ve been.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "While No. 25 TCU is trying to start a season 3-0 for the 10th time in 17 seasons, SMU has already reached that mark for the first time since 1984.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/tcu_purdue_football_12896_c0-133-3182-1988_s1770x1032.jpg?1664b5568ae85d50eed501c2b7279881ba200e0d", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
