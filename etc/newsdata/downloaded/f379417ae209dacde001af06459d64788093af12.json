She came to Politico from conservative media, most recently as a reporter at National Review. She told BuzzFeed News this week that she plans to use the Free Beacon to \u201ctrain serious reporters who have a conservative outlook and an irreverent sensibility,\u201d with a focus on breaking news and original reporting.\n\nCNN executives have publicly committed to having political diversity on air, and the network has had a host of pro-Trump and conservative voices across its programming, as well as explicitly anti-Trump and liberal ones. But the network has dropped some pro-Trump contributors this year, and the Hollywood Reporter reported it has \u201cbenched\u201d two other high-profile Trump backers who still work as contributors. The network has other conservatives as regular on-air contributors, including Mary Katharine Ham, who has written for several conservative outlets, and Rich Lowry, who is the editor of National Review.\n\nOther high-profile reporters have maintained contracts at the network as they\u2019ve changed beats or news outlets \u2014 Ryan Lizza, a CNN political analyst, has been at the network since he was a Washington correspondent at the New Yorker, and then as he moved from being chief political correspondent at Esquire to chief Washington correspondent at Politico.", "description": "Eliana Johnson\u2019s CNN contract will not be renewed, as she leaves Politico to lead the Free Beacon.", "authors": ["Matt Berman", "Buzzfeed News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-09/5/15/campaign_images/ec2c5f34c7a1/cnn-is-not-renewing-a-political-reporters-tv-deal-2-553-1567698724-0_dblbig.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
