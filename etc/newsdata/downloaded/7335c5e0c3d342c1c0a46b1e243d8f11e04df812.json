The woman insisted the nine-year-old suffering from mental illness had made a mistake\n\nThis April 6 fire near Peoria, Illinois, killed Kyle Alwood's family, including three toddlers and two adults\n\nAll five victims died of smoke inhalation inside the family's trailer at Timberline Mobile Home Park.\n\nKatrina, who was engaged to Jason, and her son from a previous relationship, Kyle, then eight years old, were the only people who managed to escape the burning residence.\n\nThe 27-year-old mother told CBS that Kyle had been recently diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and ADHD. She also revealed that the boy in the past had shown interest in lighters and fire.\n\n'Everyone is looking at him like he's some kind of monster, but that's not who he is,' Alwood told the news outlet. 'People make mistakes, and that's what this is. Yes, it was a horrible tragedy, but it's still not something to throw his life away over.'\n\nThe arson fire claimed the lives of two-year-old Daemeon Wall (left) and his one-year-old sister, Ariel Wall (right)\n\nThe siblings' father, US Army veteran Jason Wall, 34, also died of smoke inhalation\n\nNiece Rose Alwood, aged two, was staying with the Wall family and perished in the blaze\n\nDaemeon, Ariel and Kyle's great-grandmother, Kathryn Murray, 69, was killed in the fire\n\nKatrina recounted during the emotional interview how she stood at the window of her burning home and told her toddler son and daughter she was sorry she could not save them.\n\n'Mommy was right here and I loved them,' Katrina recalled telling her dying children. 'You know, so, at least hopefully they heard that. I told Jason I loved him... And then something told me that they're gone.'\n\nKatrina also talked about hearing her fiance scream, and choked back tears remembering the moment the screams ceased.\n\nDespite the heartbreak caused by her son, Katrina is hoping the judge will take into account his mental health problems and will show leniency.\n\n'I forgive him. I love him no matter what,\u2019 the mom said of Kyle.\n\nNeighbors could hear screams coming from the Wall family's mobile home (pictured) but the flames were too intense for anyone to try and rescue them\n\nWall's fiancee, Katrina, 27 (pictured right holding a baby), and her eldest child, Kyle Alwood, then aged eight (center), escaped unharmed\n\nHer sister Samantha Alwood, who lost her baby daughter Rose in the fire, wants to see her nephew sent to juvenile detention and eventually to prison for his actions.\n\n\u2018Because at the end of the day, whether he meant to or not, he knew what fire did,\u2019 Samantha said.\n\nKyle has not been detained, but because of the death threats the nine-year-old boy has been receiving, he has been sent to stay with relatives in an undisclosed location. He is due back in court on October 21.\n\nWoodford County State's Attorney Greg Minger, who filed the charges against Kyle on Tuesday, said the child, if convicted, could be placed on probation for at least five years but not beyond the age of 21, and would likely receive counseling.\n\nHe will not be imprisoned, if found guilty by a judge during a bench trial.\n\nSamantha Alwood, Katrina's sister and baby Rose's mother, wants to see her nephew imprisoned\n\nThe criminal charges were brought against Kyle six months after the deadly arson fire, which broke out at around 11pm on April 6 at 14 Cypress Court.\n\nBy the time firefighters responded to the scene six minutes later, the trailer home had been engulfed in flames.\n\nNeighbor AnnaMarie Siebert told the Journal Star at the time that screams could be heard coming from the burning property, but the flames were too intense for bystanders to try and rescue the trapped residents.\n\nKatrina Alwood and Kyle were taken to an area hospital and later released.\n\nMinger said it was a 'heavy decision' to charge a nine-year-old with one of the most serious offenses there is, but he concluded that it had to be done 'for finality.'\n\nAccording to an online obituary, Jason Wall was a US Army veteran who served several tours of duty abroad, including in Iraq, Afghanistan and Korea.\n\nAfter retiring from military service, Wall worked as a truck driver. He devoted his free time to hunting and spending time with his fiancee and their children.\n\nKatrina says she has forgiven her son (pictured bottom left with his mom) for what he had done and she loves him unconditionally.
