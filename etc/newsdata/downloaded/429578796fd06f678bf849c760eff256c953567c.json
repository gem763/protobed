USA TODAY\n\nThe last time most college football fans paid serious attention to Oregon, the Ducks were blowing a nice lead against Auburn. After that season-opening loss, it was easy to cast Oregon into the outer darkness \u2013 at least, if the focus is on the College Football Playoff (and let\u2019s be honest: These days, the focus is always on the playoff).\n\nSoon enough, the entire Pac-12 was consigned to the same place. But it\u2019s time we all start watching again \u2013 and maybe talking about Oregon again as a playoff contender.\n\nA 35-31 win at Washington showcased a rugged bunch that does not much resemble those Oregon teams of the past, but which might be elite like they were.\n\nWashington defensive back Trent McDuffie tries to tackle Oregon running back Cyrus Habibi-Likio during the second half at Husky Stadium. (Photo: Jennifer Buchanan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nJustin Herbert got most of the preseason attention, and the senior quarterback\u2019s talent is undeniable. But he (and his receivers, too) have been inconsistent. Oregon\u2019s offense is most effective when a veteran offensive line paves the way for its rushing attack. It\u2019s part of the total program makeover by Mario Cristobal, and it\u2019s been an uneven road.\n\nBut the Ducks\u2019 defense is \u2013 well, it\u2019s mean and fast and, well, it\u2019s like nothing we\u2019ve seen from Oregon in a very long time, and the strength of a very good team.\n\nSCARY SCENE: Oklahoma's Sooner Schooner crashes on field\n\nDESERVED LOSS: No. 6 Wisconsin didn't play well and Illinois beat them\n\nBAD MOVE: Clemson player ejected after throwing punch at Louisville player\n\nIn the five games after Auburn\u2019s last-minute touchdown sent Oregon to a 27-21 loss, the Ducks had allowed 25 total points. Jacob Eason and the Huskies outscored all of those opponents combined, and gave the Ducks fits for much of the game. But when it mattered, Oregon slowed and stopped Washington \u2013 including on fourth-and-3 with a little more than a minute left, sealing victory.\n\nNow, back to the bigger picture. After surviving in Seattle, the schedule looks manageable: Washington State, at USC, Arizona, at No. 17 Arizona State and then home again for the Civil War tilt with Oregon State before a Pac-12 championship game.\n\nEven if the Ducks win out, they\u2019ll need some help to get into the playoff. It might take an upset of Clemson, Ohio State or Oklahoma and maybe Notre Dame, too -- and perhaps a little chaos in the SEC, as well. But none of that is impossible. And after what we saw Saturday, neither is the idea that the Ducks might keep winning.\n\nEach time they do, that season-opening loss to Auburn becomes more regrettable. With what we\u2019ve seen since then, their return to the playoff conversation seems more doable.", "description": "No. 12 Oregon has one loss but the Ducks showed they are still in the College Football Playoff discussion with a gritty defeat of Washington on road.", "authors": ["George Schroeder", "Published P.M.
