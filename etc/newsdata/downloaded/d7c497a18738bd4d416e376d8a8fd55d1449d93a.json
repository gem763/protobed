Of these, 3,265 personal accounts have been analysed by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA).\n\nAccording to a report published on Tuesday, IICSA found most victims were sexually abused by age 11 (79 percent).\n\nAlmost half of victims (46 percent) were under eight when the abuse began. The Inquiry also heard that nearly half of all child sexual abuse (45 percent) is perpetrated by someone in the victim\u2019s family.\n\nToday\u2019s report shows even when some victims came forward to report abuse to those in authority, they were encouraged to stay silent, ignored or threatened.\n\nVictims were often warned by those in authority, including the police and social services, that their accusations could \u2018ruin\u2019 the lives of perpetrators. Others were dismissed as \u201cattention seekers\u201d, or behaved badly at school, but the signs were not picked up by their teachers.\n\nSome 86 percent of survivors told the Inquiry the abuse had a long term impact on their mental health, with over a third reporting depression (37 percent).\n\nChris Tuck, who is a member of the Inquiry\u2019s Victims and Survivors Consultative Panel said: \u201cIf we are to protect future generations of children, we need to listen to those who have experienced abuse and learn from them about what went wrong, why it went wrong and what we can put in place to stop it going wrong in the future.\u201d", "description": "Victims of child sex abuse are often told by the authority figures they confide in that their allegations could \u201cruin the perpetrators life\u201d, an analysis of over 3,200 cases found.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Eilis O'Hanlon", "Owen Paterson", "Stewart Jackson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/21/TELEMMGLPICT000031246926-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RWcv5yZLmao6LolmWYJrXns.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
