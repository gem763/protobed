Saudi Aramco, the country's large state-backed oil company, said on Sunday that it was hoping to restore on Monday about one-third of its crude output that was disrupted. The drone attacks eliminated 5.7 million barrels of production over the weekend.\n\nBrent crude futures on Monday rose $6.21 to $66.43, about 10%; West Texas Intermediate futures climbed $5.19 to 60.04, or 9.4%. Earlier in the session, the surge in Brent prices represented the largest one-day move on record.\n\nBut how higher oil prices rise will hinge on how long it will take Aramco to fully restore production, the Goldman team said. A very short outage, for example, would likely drive prices higher to reflect growing tensions in the Middle East, but only tick up $3\u20135 per barrel.\n\nHowever, a worst-case scenario could prove far worse.\n\n\"The magnitude of such a price rally is difficult to estimate in the absence of official comments on the timeline and scale of production losses,\" Currie and Courvalin wrote. \"An extreme net outage of a 4 mb/d for more than three months would likely bring prices above $75/bbl to trigger both large shale supply and demand responses.\"\n\nIn response to the weekend attack and in expectation of a spike in oil prices, President Donald Trump authorized the release of oil from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve if needed to keep the market well-supplied.\n\n\"These events represent a sharp escalation in threats to global oil supply with previous drone attacks mostly intercepted, evidence that Saudi Aramco's strongly guarded oil facility \u2013 Abqaiq \u2013 is ultimately vulnerable, a risk of further attacks (the Shaybah oilfield (1 mb/d) was unsuccessfully attacked last month), as well as potential for further escalation in the region with the US Secretary of State blaming Iran for these attacks,\" Goldman Sachs wrote.", "description": "An extended Saudi oil outage could push Brent crude prices north of $75 per barrel, Goldman Sachs warned clients.", "authors": ["Thomas Franck"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106131488-1568633140750ap_19259298199115.jpg?v=1568633217", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
