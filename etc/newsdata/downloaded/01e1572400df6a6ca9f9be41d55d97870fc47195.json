Jerry Nadler (Judiciary), Elijah Cummings (Oversight), Adam Schiff (Intelligence), Maxine Waters (Financial Services), Eliot Engel (Foreign Affairs) and Richard Neal (Ways and Means).\n\n\u201cThis week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cThe actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections. Therefore, today, I\u2019m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nTrump responded by tweeting, \u201cPelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this?\u201d before adding \u201cPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\u201d\n\nThe White House released a statement that said in part: House Democrats have destroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus all their energy on partisan political attacks. Their attacks on the President and his agenda are not only partisan and pathetic, they are in dereliction of their Constitutional duty.\n\n\u201cThe Trump Administration will continue to be vigorous in laying out the facts and standing up for the many forgotten men and women who elected him.\u201d\n\nDuring the past few days, calls for impeachment have grown louder. Seven freshman Democrats, including some from swing districts that Trump won in 2016, published an op-ed in the Washington Post Monday night calling for the president\u2019s impeachment.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi reads a statement announcing a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.\u201d\n\nRep. John Lewis, D-Ga., made the case Tuesday on the House floor.\n\n\"We cannot delay. We must not wait. Now is the time to act. I have been patient while we tried every other path and used every other tool,\" Lewis said. \"I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay, or to do otherwise, would betray the foundation of our democracy.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported that in a July 25 phone call, Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden served as vice president. According to the newspaper, Trump mentioned the issue eight times. The call is believed to have triggered a complaint by an unnamed official in the intelligence community, which the administration has refused to turn over to Congress, as required by law.\n\n\n\nIn a letter to colleagues Sunday, Pelosi warned that his administration \u201cwill be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\u201d if the whistleblower is blocked from appearing before Congress. On Tuesday, Yahoo News reported that the Senate Intelligence Committee was beginning a bipartisan inquiry into the complaint.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff said the whistleblower could testify before his panel as soon as this week.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump instructed his acting chief of staff and head of the Office of Budget and Management, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine before the conversation with Zelensky.", "description": "Pelosi, who has tried to head off talk of impeachment among her caucus, made the announcement as demands mounted for an investigation into Trump\u2019s communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.FR_VMNkYGZ6rfu6bP4hWQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/50497420-df11-11e9-adfb-d983c8e65a37", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
