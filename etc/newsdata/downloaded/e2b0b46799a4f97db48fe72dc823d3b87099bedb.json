Now What?", "language": "en", "text": "She began each of the rallies, titled \u201cDude Gotta Go,\u201d with a lengthy discussion of the president\u2019s purported crimes, and concluded by talking directly about the idea of \u201celectability,\u201d which she described as the \u201celephant\u201d in the 2020 race, and the fear that the country was not ready to elect a black woman as president.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have some real talk,\u201d Ms. Harris said in Reno. \u201cThis is not a new conversation for me. This is a conversation that I\u2019ve heard every time I\u2019ve ran a campaign and \u2014 here\u2019s the operative word \u2014 won.\u201d\n\nIn strategic terms, her campaign\u2019s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates \u2014 such as South Carolina, Nevada and California, her home state \u2014 while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.\n\nIt was a risky bet made with California confidence, that they would not only boost a candidate with the potential to make history but also do so without prioritizing Iowa and New Hampshire, a strategy that is unproven on the national stage and a break from Barack Obama\u2019s successful playbook in 2008.\n\nBut after the fleeting high of Ms. Harris\u2019s much-talked-about exchange with Mr. Biden over segregation and school busing in the first Democratic debate, it became clear that several assumptions underpinning that national strategy were not in line with the current moment.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s support soon bounced back, fueled by perceptions that he was best suited to defeat Mr. Trump, which remains the obsessive top priority for most Democratic voters. Mr. Biden\u2019s strength with black voters has been particularly difficult for Ms. Harris to match, and some of her own supporters from within the Congressional Black Caucus told her privately they felt the debate moment had crossed a line.\n\nMs. Warren and Mr. Sanders have also dictated the policy terms of the primary and the debates, pulling Ms. Harris between the dueling worlds of progressives advocating structural change and Mr. Biden\u2019s yesteryear centrism. She prefers neither.", "description": "Ms. Harris has seen her stock fall in the presidential race. As she goes all in on Iowa, will voters respond?", "authors": ["Astead W.
