Ralph Fethiere. Chery was treated and released from a Port-au-Prince hospital and was expected to undergo further treatment this week to remove the object from his jaw.\n\n\u201cThankfully, he is expected to be OK. While it does not appear he was targeted, this is a reminder of the danger journalists around the world face every day while doing their jobs, even on a routine assignment,\u201d said Lauren Easton, AP\u2019s global director of media relations and corporate communications.\n\nA Senate security guard also suffered what appeared to be a gunshot wound to the stomach.\n\nSenators were convening Monday to approve Fritz William Michel\u2019s nomination as prime minister. Several hundred opposition supporters confronted Fethiere and other senators from the governing party. Fethiere pulled a pistol when protesters rushed at him and members of his entourage.\n\nMoments before the shooting, AP journalists saw supporters of about a half-dozen opposition senators approaching Fethiere, hurling dirt at him and accusing him of selling his vote in favor of Michel.\n\nThe opposition is trying to block the formation of a new government as a way of pressuring President Jovenel Moise to leave office. They blame Moise for failure to address pervasive corruption and mismanaging the economy. The country is running low on fuel and inflation is spiraling, leading to widespread public discontent.\n\nFethiere told Haitian radio station Signal FM that he opened fire because he feared for his life.\n\n\u201cIt was just self-defense,\u201d he said. \u201cArmed individuals tried to attack me \u2026 They tried to pull me out of my car and I had to defend myself.\u201d\n\nThe vote to ratify Michel was canceled, the second failed attempt to approve the president\u2019s nominee after his approval by Haiti\u2019s lower house.\n\nThe capital was hit by a series of demonstrations and roadblocks Monday, leading to the latest in a string of near-complete shutdowns of Port-au-Prince that have further damaged the ailing economy.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An Associated Press photographer was wounded Monday in a shooting that erupted outside Haiti's Senate when a senator the governing party fired a pistol during a confrontation with opposition protesters.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Evens Sanon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/haiti_parliament_77157_c0-205-2443-1629_s1770x1032.jpg?0980a3ef76974a6c3386065ad2d96a4c3d30a10d", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
