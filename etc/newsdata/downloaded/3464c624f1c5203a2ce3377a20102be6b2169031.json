Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee and vocal pro-impeachment advocate.\n\n\u201cThat cuts across all political and geographic lines in the party right now. There\u2019s just unity about it,\u201d Raskin said.\n\nJoseph McGuire, the acting director of national intelligence, will appear before the panel after blocking Congress\u2019 effort to learn more details of a whistleblower complaint that Trump allegedly urged the newly elected Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\nJoin our reporters for live coverage of the U.N. General Assembly 9AM on SEPT. 24 for live coverage of the U.N. General Assembly ADD TO GOOGLE CALENDAR\n\nPelosi \u2014 who fired her own warning shot at Trump about the issue on Sunday \u2014 has so far remained steadfastly against impeachment, buoyed by dozens of vulnerable Democrats who worry it could cost them reelection.\n\nBut multiple lawmakers \u2014 including freshman Democrats who have so far resisted calls for impeachment \u2014 held frantic calls over the weekend to discuss the reports, according to people familiar with the calls.\n\nOne freshman Democrat, who declined to speak publicly, described it as a \u201cseismic change in mood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Mueller, it\u2019s something else,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nIf a bloc of the party comes out for impeachment, it could change the dynamic within the caucus in an instant. A majority of the caucus already supports impeachment but many of the remaining holdouts are the \u201cmajority makers\u201d \u2014 vulnerable Democrats who flipped Republican districts in 2018 to take back control of the House.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday called for hearings into the whistleblower complaint, as well as a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress \"as required by law.\" Republicans have largely been silent on the allegations.\n\nTrump has defiantly insisted he did nothing wrong in his conversation with Ukrainian officials and said he may release a transcript of the call. But the administration has come under fire for withholding military aid for Ukraine at the same time, a move Democrats said was designed to exert maximum pressure on Ukraine and force the country into pursuing the Biden allegations.\n\nTrump himself further inflamed the controversy on Monday, as he appeared to confirm that he had tied U.S. aid to his demand that Ukraine investigate Biden\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supporting a country. We want to make sure that country is honest. It\u2019s very important to talk about corruption. If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d Trump told reporters before heading into a United Nations event, when asked about what he told Ukrainian leaders.\n\nA day before, the president acknowledged that he encouraged Ukrainian leaders to probe Hunter Biden\u2019s past work in the country, a move he could potentially use to try to derail Biden\u2019s presidential run and boost his own reelection campaign.\n\nin a letter to colleagues Sunday, Pelosi warned that the Trump\u2019s administration's efforts to stonewall Congress from seeing the whistleblower complaint would mark \u201ca grave new chapter of lawlessness.\u201d\n\nThe California Democrat said Democrats would demand to see the full whistleblower complaint \u2014 as well as testimony from the whistleblower directly. She did not specifically warn of the consequences if the Trump administration blocked either from happening, but many of her Democratic colleagues see it as a potential tipping point to begin formal impeachment proceedings.\n\nSeveral vocal impeachment backers, including those on the House Judiciary Committee, have felt stymied by how little progress they\u2019ve made. Some, like Reps. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Joe Neguse (D-Col.), are calling on top Democrats to shift gears from their litigation-focused strategy and use inherent contempt \u2014 Congress\u2019 rarely deployed power to detain or fine witnesses who refuse to testify.\n\nKey court cases remain tied up, including attempts to secure Trump\u2019s financial records, with no guarantee of resolving them before the 2020 election. High-profile hearings have yielded little, including last week\u2019s circus-like testimony of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\nProgressives, who have for months pushed Democratic leaders to launch impeachment proceedings, have indicated they\u2019re losing patience with Pelosi\u2019s slow-going strategy.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it,\u201d said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) in a message to her millions of Twitter followers.\n\nAndrew Desiderio contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "If the vulnerable lawmakers shift course, it will put real pressure on Speaker Nancy Pelosi to embrace Trump's ouster.", "authors": ["Heather Caygle", "Sarah Ferris", "John Bresnahan"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d4/de/9161fafd40b2ac3173f108c4c027/190923-nancy-pelosi-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
