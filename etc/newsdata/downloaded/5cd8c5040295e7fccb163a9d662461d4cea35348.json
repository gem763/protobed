By contrast, 48% of us (hello! My name is Lucy Mangan and I do not even have a passport) took no flights abroad at all.\n\nIt is a reminder of the eternal truth that in most areas of life it is a particularly poisonous \u2013 almost literally in this case \u2013 few that ruin things for the rest of us. From the people who drive with their radios at full blast and shatter the peace of every passerby to the handful of companies that set the bar for workers\u2019 rights (and lack thereof) and make it uncompetitive for anyone else to do right by theirs, to the handful of billionaires who carry on sucking up the world\u2019s money and resources, to the megalomaniac elite who dominate our politics \u2013 wherever you look, this kind of disproportion is embedded.\n\nI don\u2019t know why this so often gets overlooked \u2013 why we so often go after the many instead of the few. Is it really easier to try to change millions of individuals\u2019 recycling habits than legislate against industrial pollution? Is it really better to encourage people to \u201cshop local\u201d instead of taxing Amazon properly? And so very much on.\n\nThe older and more impatient I get, the more I cleave to the dream of culling the worst offending 10% of the international population \u2013 nothing violent, just putting them all on the Isle of Wight and keeping them fed and watered until they reach the end of their allotted spans \u2013 and revolutionising the quality of life for the remaining 90%.\n\nThinking small and very, very focused will save us yet.\n\n\u2022 Lucy Mangan is a Guardian writer", "description": "News that 1% of England\u2019s residents take 20% of flights abroad is yet more proof that a handful of people ruin things for the rest of us, writes Lucy Mangan", "authors": ["Lucy Mangan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ae3adf1282585adad0408d614886fc015f079d7/0_387_6608_3965/master/6608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=931835a1a07f86ad7aa72f099a78476e", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
