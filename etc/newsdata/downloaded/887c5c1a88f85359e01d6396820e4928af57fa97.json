(Norm Shafer for The Washington Post)\n\nLast month, 18-year-old Aris Eduardo Lobo-Perez became a newly minted college freshman, moving from his home in Culpeper, Va., to begin his first semester at Radford University.\n\nClasses started on Aug. 26. Seventeen days later, the sports management major was found dead in a Virginia jail cell, eight hours after he was arrested by campus police on a charge of swearing or intoxication in public.\n\nOfficials at New River Valley Regional Jail released few details about the circumstances of the teenager\u2019s death but said in a statement that he was arrested just before midnight on Wednesday and taken to their facility.\n\nJail officers checked on him Thursday morning and found him unresponsive in his cell. New River Valley Regional Jail in Dublin houses more than 1,000 inmates, according to Gregory P. Winston, the jail\u2019s superintendent. This is the jail\u2019s first reported death since 2016.\n\nVirginia State Police confirmed that the agency is investigating his death.\n\nRadford University distributed a letter to faculty, students and staff Thursday evening informing them of Lobo-Perez\u2019s death. The letter said his death was \u201cunexpected\u201d and shared no other details about the circumstances.\n\nLobo-Perez\u2019s mother and siblings could not be reached for comment Saturday. But tributes started pouring in online from his friends and family in Culpeper, which is about 70 miles southwest of Washington. Those who knew him donated thousands to a GoFundMe account raising money for a funeral.\n\n\u201cIn honor of who we grew up with, who we laughed with, who we shared our lives with, and who we currently cry for, wish for any donations to help cover the cost of any future services in honor of his memory,\u201d the GoFundMe page reads.\n\nThe online fundraiser included four pictures of the teenager with bouncy curls. He and his twin sister, Ariela, graduated from Eastern View High School in the spring. In one photo, he is donning a Radford University shirt.\n\nOn Facebook, friends also organized a yard sale to help with funeral expenses.\n\nLobo-Perez updated what appeared to be his own Facebook page just weeks ago, informing his followers that he was a student at Radford University, which is located almost 200 miles from Culpeper.\n\n\u201cSo proud of you!\u201d a Facebook friend responded. \u201cWith hard work you can accomplish anything! Remember we are here for YOU! Take care of yourself.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Aris Eduardo Lobo-Perez, 18, was arrested hours earlier for public intoxication.", "authors": ["Perry Stein", "Reporter Covering D.C.
