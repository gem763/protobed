Shower chances then dwindle with no significant rainmakers in the near future. Otherwise, we\u2019re on the cloudier and cooler side today, and then partly sunny and a bit warmer tomorrow into the weekend.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

Confidence: Medium-High\n\nHigh pressure breaks down as a weak cold front approaches Saturday, perhaps mustering a light shower or two. Saturday highs should reach the upper 60s to low 70s under partly cloudy skies, with Saturday night lows falling back to the upper 40s to mid-50s. More of the same Sunday with partly cloudy skies, highs in the upper 60s to low 70s, and only a slight chance of a shower.
