Whereas a recession may lead to lower consumption, the big shift is away from selling commodities, and much more investing in services business. Such investing in the right part of the energy system can almost be seen as a recession hedge,\u201d he said. Meaning, it\u2019s less about the commodity itself and more about the companies and services that distribute it.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the sector doesn\u2019t face any challenges, however.\n\n\u201cI think what you see is there's a big change happening in the energy system as a whole. So whereas before... we had a very strong focus on centralized [energy] generation, we're now looking at much more distributed, cleaner generation. And that comes with its own challenges,\u201d Bode said. \u201cAnd those challenges are actually bigger than a potential impact of a recession.\u201d\n\nSince the 2008 recession, utilities have gone from record lows on a steady climb, and reached record highs this week. This trend will likely continue as interest rates go down, investors redirect a lot of their assets to utilities to ensure dividends. (For example, American Electric Power Company (AEP) has a 2.84% dividend yield, while Duke Energy (DUK) has a 3.94% dividend yield.)\n\nOn the flip side, the energy sector as a whole has taken a beating with benchmark oil and gas stocks like Continental Resources (CLR) down 21% and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) down 26% year to date.\n\n\u201cI think the key thing is to really try and understand fundamentally what is changing in the sector. And based on that\u2026 make your investments. So that means that given the fact that the sector is changing fundamentally, so drastically, it is really, really important to understand how energy transition is going,\u201d Bode said.\n\nAshley is a Production Assistant for Yahoo Finance.
