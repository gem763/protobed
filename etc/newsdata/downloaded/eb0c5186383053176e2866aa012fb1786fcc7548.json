Andrew Cuomo: Plategate, a plan to change the design of the state\u2019s license plates and mandate that all drivers pay for new ones.\n\nThe governor announced a design competition in the doldrums of August, allowing New Yorkers to pick among five license plates. Three plates included variations on the Statue of Liberty, one plate showed a series of landmarks including Niagara Falls and the Manhattan skyline, and a fifth featured the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge\u2014which replaced the Tappan Zee Bridge.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats pounced, asking why New Yorkers should be forced to pay $25 to replace perfectly good license plates, starting in April. Many also immediately assumed the worst about the survey, and feared the Cuomo bridge would be declared the winner because those who count the votes have more power than those who cast them.\n\nThe issue has stuck. An upstate cable network has aired five news stories in three weeks. The Republican State Committee launched digital advertisements and state Sen. Jim Tedisco started an online petition.\n\nUnlike complicated budgeting shifts or tweaks to obscure laws, this issue resonates, lawmakers say, because it is concrete and affects a broad swath of voters. It is another $25 from people who already feel overtaxed and who might argue any interaction with the Department of Motor Vehicles is taxing enough. And it is a display of hubris and narcissism, GOP leaders charged.\n\nMr. Tedisco, a Republican from suburban Albany, said the issue provoked one of the biggest responses he can recall in over 40 years as a legislator. There are three million plates now over 10 years old that the state will replace in the next two years. That will generate at least $75 million in fees, but Mr. Tedisco estimated the actual state cost is $5 million.\n\n\u201cThis is a Plategate tax\u2014$70 million,\u201d Mr. Tedisco said at a Wednesday news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s the lack of transparency. Vote for this; don\u2019t look behind the curtain.\u201d\n\nThe governor has offered a series of statements on the topic. First, that it was necessary with the state\u2019s growing adoption of cashless tolling, where machines read license plates of cars that don\u2019t have E-ZPass transponders. (Like yours truly.) This was met with furrowed brows: There are already cashless bridges and tunnels in some areas, and the scanners seem to work fine even on cars with decade-plus-old plates (again, like yours truly).\n\nMr. Cuomo then said that 10 years was an \u201cindustry standard,\u201d and his aides began spitting out the names of states with much shorter plate life-cycles. Currently, plates must be replaced if they are unreadable or deficient; under Mr. Cuomo\u2019s plan all plates will be replaced after a decade.\n\nThe skyline design won the online contest.

It\u2019s your fault.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Tedisco\u2019s news conference, gubernatorial adviser Rich Azzopardi said the senator was \u201ctalking to himself.\u201d\n\nThe governor is also attacking reporters, saying in a Friday public-radio interview that the controversy was \u201ccheap politics meets cheap journalism.\u201d\n\nBut it is clear this is now a rear-guard action. Even as he blasted his critics, he said he was willing to work with lawmakers to lower the fee or perhaps come up with a new system to determine when plates need to be replaced.\n\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles, after a week of silence, announced after 4 p.m. Friday that the skyline design had won the online contest.\n\nA DMV spokeswoman said that design received 49.7% of the vote; the Cuomo bridge plate won 9.7%, in a tie for last place.\n\nTHE QUESTION: Which governor attributed his 1980 re-election loss to increasing fees for motor-vehicle registration?\n\nKnow the answer? Leave a comment!\n\nTHE LAST ANSWER: The chicken nugget was invented by Dr. Robert Baker, whose descendants still run the Baker\u2019s Chicken Coop at the New York State Fair.\n\nWrite to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com", "description": "What could have been a fun summer story for New York Gov.
