The woman said Jamalzadah\u2019s programme, The Mozhdah Show, had stopped her husband beating their children, after it covered corporal punishment. \u201cBut from her face, I could tell that there was more to it,\u201d says the 37-year-old. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that maybe he stopped beating her, too. That made me very emotional, and she just kept repeating: \u2018We need you, Afghanistan needs you.\u2019\u201d\n\nJamalzadah was five when her family escaped Afghanistan, eventually settling in Canada. In 2009, in her mid-20s, she returned to Kabul after being invited by a new TV station to host a talent show. She had started singing a few years earlier, posting music videos on YouTube; one song, Afghan Girl, had become a hit in her homeland (she would be invited to perform it in 2010 at the White House to mark International Women\u2019s Day in front of the Obamas).\n\nAs a woman there, you\u2019re pretty much voiceless. Maybe I can\u2019t do anything in Afghanistan, but I can in Canada\n\nShe and her mother, Nasrin, travelled to Kabul. But unbeknown to Jamalzadah, Nasrin had no intention of letting her daughter present a mere talent show. Instead she had packed several DVDs of The Oprah Winfrey Show \u2013 which they had been watching for years in Nasrin\u2019s hair salon in Vancouver \u2013 and during their first meeting with TV executives, she pitched The Mozhdah Show. Not just a chatshow, either, but a vehicle, modelled on Oprah, to change the lives of Afghan women. The TV station went for it \u2013 and it ran from 2009 to 2011. For a country reeling from years of war, followed by the harsh Taliban rule, Jamalzadah became an image of what a modern Afghan woman could be \u2013 and there were many people in the country of her birth who didn\u2019t like it.\n\nJamalzadah speaks by Skype from Toronto, where she is promoting a film, Red Snow. In it, she plays the educated daughter of an Afghan family who help a First Nations Gwich\u2019in soldier in the Canadian army, who is captured by the Taliban. A biography of Jamalzadah is also just about to be published. In the film, she wears a blue burqa \u2013 it\u2019s the same garment Nasrin wore, hoping to pass as a peasant, when they fled Kabul about 30 years earlier, making a perilous journey to Pakistan. Her father, Bashir, had been a teacher when word got to him that he was about to be arrested because he was suspected of opposing the Soviet-backed government. The Jamalzadahs \u2013 Nasrin and Bashir, Mozhda and her two younger brothers, one of whom was only six months old \u2013 fled. \u201cI was well aware that there was a major possibility we might not make it,\u201d she says. \u201cMy heart would beat every time a soldier would hop up on the bus, and I would think: \u2018I hope they don\u2019t find out we\u2019re city people.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey were granted asylum in Canada and moved to Ontario. Jamalzadah remembers the cold, mostly, and, while she made good friends, she also experienced overt racism. Yet, she says: \u201cAt the same time, I knew we were safe, and I didn\u2019t have to worry about whether my family were going to be OK. In Afghanistan I had rockets firing over my head and didn\u2019t know where they were going to land. I would be out in the yard playing with my cousin, and you could hear the rockets. The racism and all the other stuff didn\u2019t compare to trying to survive.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mozhdah - Hat Idak feat Absolute (YouTube).\n\nThe family settled in Vancouver, where Bashir opened a pizza restaurant and Nasrin a hair salon. As a teenager, Jamalzadah became obsessed with reports about the war in Afghanistan, searching online and watching the news as soon as she was home from school. \u201cI wanted to know how my family was, because there was no phone, no contact. I would think the worst when the bombings were happening, right after 9/11.\u201d\n\nHer parents had urged her not to take opportunities and freedoms for granted, and she didn\u2019t, but it also made her feel guilty that she was living such a different life to the friends she had left in Afghanistan. \u201cMy parents wanted me to use all of it fully so they were constantly reminding me how lucky I was. But, constantly being reminded, I was becoming more and more depressed. While all my other friends were talking about shopping and boys they had crushes on, secretly, this was my torment. I was constantly looking for ways to do something to help and speak up for those people.\u201d\n\nShe had been writing poetry and realised that while she could never remember the words of political speeches, she always remembered song lyrics. So one day she told her mother she\u2019d like to find someone to turn her poems into songs. Nasrin encouraged her to have singing lessons with the Afghan-Canadian musician Wahid Omid. He uploaded one song to YouTube and it went viral.\n\n\u201cI think people were hungry for something new, different. I was a girl and after the war there were hardly any female singers, especially ones who pranced around in the outfits I did.\u201d The online attacks soon started, and Jamalzadah says she almost gave up, but she realised that was what the trolls wanted. Her next song, Dukhtare Afghan (Afghan Girl), written about an acid attack on girls going to school, was played on Afghan radio and became a hit, bringing her to the attention of TV executives.\n\nBeing in Kabul, she says, \u201cwas magical. I mean, there\u2019s barbed wire, dust everywhere, it\u2019s a war zone, but I was totally OK with that because I was around Afghan people, and they seemed exactly the way that they were before. The love and the hospitality, and everything that Afghans stand for, was still there.\u201d\n\nShe laughs now too at how naive she was. Once she thought she heard a door slam and someone at her guesthouse told her it was a bomb. Another time, she thought she heard fireworks, only for the CEO of the TV station to shout at her not to leave the building: \u201cYou\u2019re going to get hit by a bullet: do you not hear what\u2019s going on out there?\u201d \u201cSo it was comical, but very dark,\u201d she says. In 2009: \u201cThere were times where everything felt like it was OK, other than the few suicide bombings here and there \u2013 everyone was just out and about, there were restaurants, everything was lively, and I loved it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mozhdah Jamalzadah and her mother Nasrin at their backyard near Vancouver, Canada.

And of course, [the TV station] wanted to keep us safe.\u201d Her show started mildly, then began moving into territory such as domestic violence and divorce, as well as the cost of weddings, which can lead families into crippling debt. Alongside lighter material such as singers and children\u2019s competitions, the show often included sketches to drive home the issues discussed, and interviews with experts, such as child psychologists.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we started receiving threats,\u201d she says. Did she feel unsafe? \u201cIf I constantly lived in fear, it would stop me from doing anything, so I stopped myself from thinking about it.\u201d\n\nShe thinks her experience as a child, \u201cnot knowing if I\u2019m going to live or not, affected me \u2013 it\u2019s normal for me. I\u2019d rather live a shorter life and have it be more impactful and live it to the fullest, then have a long one living in fear, afraid to go out and do something because I might get killed.\u201d\n\nShe was, she admits, protected to some degree by her Canadian citizenship. One girl, a contestant on a TV talent show, Afghan Star, that Jamalzadah presented from 2012 to 2013, told her: \u201cIf I had a foreign passport, I would dress like you. You can go back to Canada, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m stuck here.\u201d \u201cShe was right. I could see that in the way that I was treated. I\u2019m sure that there were lots of people who would have liked to do all kinds of things but couldn\u2019t get away with it. I think my fear was lessened because at any point, I could go to the Canadian embassy and be protected.\u201d\n\nIt couldn\u2019t, however, protect her from a horrific attack by a man who she says assumed, because she was westernised, that she would be open to a sexual relationship. She alleges he lured her to an empty nightclub, then attacked her violently; and she only got away after threatening him with a gun she kept in her bag. \u201cThe attack that happened to me happens to girls constantly, and there is nothing they can do. Even I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she says. She wanted to report it, \u201cbut as a woman there, you\u2019re pretty much voiceless. Maybe I can\u2019t do anything in Afghanistan, but I can in Canada. I can\u2019t report it there, but I told my story.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, flying back to Kabul after a break in Canada, the Canadian embassy got in touch with her en route and told her there had been a serious threat, and that she should turn back. She ignored the warning, but in Kabul, her TV colleagues said the same thing and told her they were taking the show off-air.\n\nSafe space: the new cinema welcoming women in male-dominated Kabul Read more\n\n\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt defeated. When you\u2019re on this high and think, \u2018I\u2019m making a difference\u2019, then all of a sudden, all of that is shattered. I felt like a complete failure.\u201d\n\nShe returned to Canada wanting to give up. \u201cI was like \u2018it\u2019s over. How stupid was I to think that I could make a difference?\u2019 Then slowly I had to get myself out of that darkness and, and realise, no, I can\u2019t let them defeat me.\u201d She started thinking: \u201cI could do so much more from here, and it doesn\u2019t have to be The Mozhdah Show.\u201d\n\nShe has a strong social media presence in Afghanistan, where she is both supported and attacked for her posts. She sings in English, as well as in Farsi, and hopes to cross over to a bigger western audience. \u201cI know it\u2019s going to be a lot of work, but I have to do it. My goal is to be a women\u2019s rights activist in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cI have to work to get myself to a position where I can speak for women who don\u2019t have a voice, on a much bigger scale. That\u2019s my goal now.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Voice of Rebellion, the biography of Mozhdah Jamalzadah, is out on 7 November", "description": "The presenter, pop star and women\u2019s rights activist Mozhdah Jamalzadah talks about fleeing her country, before returning and revolutionising Afghan TV", "authors": ["Emine Saner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d83d6a11c254b7a88c3d6a0844ab1c4e7e9d3b/0_214_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0e8d2f0f0f25891f545e6cdc23fa85d3", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
