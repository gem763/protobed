Suddenly, you see a cheerful dog wagging its tail at you, just past the school gate. You walk towards the dog and give it a few pats on the head, and realise everything is going to be OK.\n\nAt Independent Schools Foundation Academy, instances like these happen 100 times a day, says Dr Rick Smith. Smith is the school\u2019s learning and well-being specialist. His partner is Tucker, a chocolate brown Australian labradoodle, who works at the school as a therapy dog.\n\n\u201cSometimes, [primary school] kids arrive at the front gate in tears because they don\u2019t want to leave their parents. And then they turn around and see a labradoodle. They then go from crying to, \u201cOh hey, Tucker!\u201d as they enter the school,\u201d says Smith.\n\nVideo of Tucker the therapy dog goes to school\n\nTwo-year-old Tucker is a master at helping people relax, and he\u2019s particularly good at calming anxious children, or those that can\u2019t sit still. His go-to move is to flop down on a student\u2019s lap, like a big, warm, soft cushion. This gives the kids something soft to stroke and also makes it harder for them to stand up and run around.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun to see how people interact with Tucker and how everybody smiles when they see him,\u201d says Stella Erro, a 12-year-old ISF Academy student. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see my classmates smile, even after a long day at school.\u201d\n\nStudents are usually shy about going to the school\u2019s learning support room, a place where they can ask for help with their school work or talk about personal problems, but Tucker gives them an excuse to visit.\n\nLetters from the Dorm: Dogs aren't the only therapy animals helping stressed-out university students\n\n\u201cIt is not something to be ashamed of, but some students feel embarrassed about going to learning support. But with Tucker there, they can just say they\u2019re going to hang out with him,\u201d explains Stella.\n\nRyan Ho Long-hei, also 12, says he has always longed for a pet.\n\n\u201cTucker makes me very happy. Sometimes before assessments and tests, I feel really tense. But when I see Tucker and interact with him, I feel a lot more relaxed,\u201d says Ryan.\n\n\u201cHe gives a lot of us moral support.\u201d\n\nSmith says he\u2019s also witnessed first-hand how Tucker helps students overcome their fears. He remembers several students who were terrified of Tucker at first and ran to hide in a corner.\n\nTucker is trained to work on the school's learning support team.

That\u2019s been a common experience for a lot of the kids,\u201d he says.\n\nUnlike a lot of dogs that are active and run around a lot, Tucker is quite the opposite. He is always very calm. This makes students, even those who were afraid of dogs at first, feel safe around him.\n\n\u201cI feel calm seeing a dog being so calm. It\u2019s just different to see such a quiet and still dog,\u201d adds Ryan.\n\nAnother difference between Tucker and other pet dogs is that he doesn\u2019t respond to any commands. Instead, he makes his own decisions.\n\nHow social media can be a force for good\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s quite similar to a seeing-eye dog,\u201d or guide dog for blind people, Smith says.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want the dog to respond to sit or stay at a pedestrian crossing, you would want the dog to decide what to do,\u201d explains Smith.\n\nFor example, if Smith gets fidgety or starts biting his nails, Tucker recognises that and jumps up on his lap to keep him company without being asked. But when asked to sit down or do tricks, he doesn\u2019t listen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that he has the freedom to make the decision to know what to do and how to respond [to people\u2019s anxiety],\u201d he adds.\n\nEdited by Nicole Moraleda", "description": "As part of the learning support team at Hong Kong\u2019s ISF Academy, he is empowered to make his own decisions rather than follow orders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/a1909e40-eb0e-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires111944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
