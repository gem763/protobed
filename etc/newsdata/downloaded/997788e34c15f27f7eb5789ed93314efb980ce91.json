No one expects us to win again \u2014 but we believe.\u201d", "description": "Yokohama (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 After a sleepless night replaying Japan\u2019s historic Rugby World Cup victory over Scotland in his head, captain Michael", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/1e6121_japan-captain-michael-leitch-team-has-room-improve-reaching-world-cup-quarter-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
