Two, I was a southpaw. And three, I was good. He was right, it was never easy.\u201d\n\nIn 1980, after defeats, robberies in the ring, fights as the outsider in hostile places, outrageous fortune and a violent siege at Wembley after he cut Alan Minter in three vicious rounds, Hagler was finally the world middleweight champion. It was his 54th fight and he had to leave the ring that shameful night at Wembley Arena under a makeshift umbrella of outstretched arms, as bottles and parts of seats were thrown at his bald head.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The real fans loved me,\u201d he added, picking up another wild cheer.\n\n\u201cWhy did it take me so long to win the title?\u201d Hagler asked. \u201cIt was not my fault, they were scared. I was never scared, I just wanted to fight the best man. That is how you find out how good you are. I guess I was great.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9.

The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nHagler had been a professional boxer for eight years when he became champion.\n\nOnce Hager won the title he had one of the last great, dignified and honest reigns as world champion in a sport now so horribly diluted with endless opportunities that it would be virtually impossible to repeat his achievements. Sadly, in the modern sport the greatest rivalries are between television companies and the promoters they employ to deliver the fights, and not the boxers. It means that the agendas - often understandable because of the vast financial investment - of warring men on the safe side of the ropes helps to keep boxers apart.\n\nThat is modern time, not Hagler\u2019s time. \u201cI had to beat and keep on beating my number one contender - that is how it should be; one man, one champion. That man was me,\u201d he said, another great cheer rattling the chandeliers.\n\nIn recent years the Kazakh, Gennady Golovkin, held several versions of the middleweight championship and during his eight-year reign nearly 20 men also had a claim to be \u201cworld middleweight champion\u201d after winning a piece of the title. Hagler was undisputed champion, nobody else held a version of his title, the public would have simply rejected the blatant chicanery at the time and for seven long years he beat his number one and mandated contenders, often defying the bookies, the guides and the desires of many. Marvelous Marvin Hagler was the only middleweight champion, a man made and shaped in a very different time.\n\n\u201cWhen you are the champion you have to work harder,\u201c Hagler added. \u201cThey want what you have and I remember that feeling; I wanted every single thing the champions had. I was built to destroy, it was always war with me.\u201d Hagler made twelve defences, stopped or knocked out eleven of the men he beat, including Tommy Hearns in Las Vegas in 1985 - the fight is considered one of the greatest.\n\n\u201cYou know, I never stopped listening when I was fighting,\u201d Hagler continued. \u201cIn the gym I never took it easy - you take it easy there, you night take it easy in the ring. Boxing was my art, that\u2019s how I treated it and there was a lot about the sport that I hated.\u201d\n\nHagler might have considered his fighting days as the worst of times, with rejection, open corruption, the FBI constantly investigating crooked officials, but in many ways his fighting days were the best of times. Hagler lived in the ring in the final days of a boxing world where one man was champion; he is a relic, a living legend, a real fighting man.\n\nA gentleman.\n\nMarvelous Marvin Hagler was in Glasgow with Premier Events UK.", "description": "In Glasgow, close to midnight on Sunday, 500 people listened in silence as Marvelous Marvin Hagler explained that there was never a time in his life when it was easy.", "authors": ["Steve Bunce"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/30/15/marvin-hagler.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
