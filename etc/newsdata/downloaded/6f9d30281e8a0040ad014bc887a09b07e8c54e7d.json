The speedster from Nagpur mistook cricket for golf. He used the bat like a driver, teeing off 5 of the 10 balls he faced beyond the ropes. One of them landed deep in the stands sending captain Virat Kohli into a schoolboyish peal of delight and the sparse crowd into rapture. Yadav\u2019s pre-Diwali crackers were but another pointer to India\u2019s toying with South Africa in the 3 Test series which ended with a 3-0 whitewash on Tuesday.\n\nStatistics are imperfect storytellers but, in this case, demonstrate the yawning gap between the two sides. South Africa, ranked world\u2019s no 3 Test side, couldn\u2019t bowl out India in a single innings. In all, India lost a mere 25 wickets to South Africa\u2019s 60. Indian batsmen smashed 7 centuries in 4 innings, South Africans just 2 in 6. Sixes rained like seats for BJP. India plundered 47, a record in the 142-year-old history of Test cricket. Kohli\u2019s men took the first Test by 203 runs, the second by an innings and 37 and the third by an innings and 202. The Ranchi Test was over in less than 8 sessions. If this was boxing, a referee could have stopped the bout midway.\n\nIt\u2019s worth celebrating that India\u2019s triumph wasn\u2019t manufactured on gracious dirt tracks where deliveries explode like hand grenades from the first day. The pitches were true, a sign of the team\u2019s self-belief, even though South Africa had ace speed merchant Kagiso Rabada (ranked world no 2) and his regular partner-in-crime Vernon Philander. India showed application to ride out the early roughs, then conquered each time.\n\nWith big scores as cushion, the bowlers pounded the Proteas to submission. For years, Indian batters have hopped, ducked, swerved and fended off nasty projectiles. In this series, the SAfricans were taken to a headbanger\u2019s ball. Quinton de Kock was hustled by a Yadav snorter, fellow opener Dean Elgar stung like a curse by another wicked Yadav delivery.\n\nThe Shami-Yadav combo produced a highlights package of unplayables. Yadav scalped 11 wickets at an average of 12. Shami snared 13 at about 15 runs apiece. Rabada, SAfrica\u2019s best on the tour, had mere 7 victims for 41 runs each. The spinners were too vastly superior to their visiting counterparts. Few had a clue to offie Ravichandran Ashwin (15) and left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja (13). Proteas batter Temba Bavuma honestly admitted, \u201cI\u2019m giving my best but probably my best at this point in time is not good enough.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa were caught in a perfect storm where every member of the rival squad \u2013 including 30-year-old Bokaro-born debutant Shahbaz Nadeem \u2013 contributed to the team\u2019s cause. Keeper Wriddhiman Saha showed why his skipper thinks he is the best in the business. Opener Mayank Agarwal cemented his place. Recast as a Test opener, Rohit Sharma was all discipline before unleashing a smorgasbord of shots and emerge with Gavaskaresque scores.\n\nIt\u2019s often said that a captain is as good as his team. Kohli has forged a terrific unit where the team\u2019s bench strength is stronger than ever. Shami, Ishant Sharma and the improved Yadav are a formidable pace trio. Once the injured Jasprit Bumrah is back, India can be lethal on any track. Imagine a bowler of Bhuvneshwar Kumar\u2019s calibre unable to get into the team!\n\nA horses-for-courses policy seems to be in place. Hanuma Vihari, so productive in the Caribbean, sat out in 2 Tests because he was surplus to the needs. Kohli has also shown supreme self-belief and not just in his early declarations. His differences with Rohit have been admitted even by coach Shastri. But he backed Rohit all the same.\n\nIf India has been about synergy, South Africa has functioned as its opposite. Opener Aiden Markram\u2019s self-injury, borne out of frustration at his partner\u2019s wrong DRS call, explains the team\u2019s state of mind. The Proteas are also far from finding suitable replacements for Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers and Jacques Kallis, three of their finest ever. It won\u2019t be easy.\n\nThe quota system offers wider social representation but has pushed top talents such as Duanne Olivier, Morne Morkel, Rilee Roussouw, Kyle Abbott and others to opt for the Kolpak deal. The deal allows an athlete to play as a domestic player in EU countries but prevents them from representing their own country. In recent years, cricket in Africa \u2013 Zimbabwe and Kenya \u2013 has been on the backfoot. But none would be sadder than a slow slide of Nelson Mandela\u2019s Rainbow nation which played its first international game after sporting readmission against India, an acknowledgement of its unwavering campaign against apartheid.\n\nRight now, Team India is world\u2019s no 1 Test side, the ICC rank justifiably earned. But to earn a date with greatness, it needs to win consistently against the major teams abroad. Early this year, India accomplished a handsome 2-1 win in Australia after finishing second best to South Africa and England in 2018. Next February a 2 Test battle in New Zealand, currently world no 2, will be a sterner test for Kohli\u2019s men.\n\nLike ODI and T20, Test cricket will have a world champion in 2021. With 5 wins out of 5 matches and 240 points in the bag, India are comfortably perched at the top in the ongoing World Test Championship. On form and talent, Kohli and company can deservingly dream about the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.", "description": "Last Sunday, Umesh Yadav went batty.
