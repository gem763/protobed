And the response from the fans on site and on social media was remarkable, just as it was for his Masters resurrection in April. McIlroy thinks he knows why. \u201cTiger\u2019s been through a lot in terms of injuries and some of the breaks he\u2019s been forced to take,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cAnd because he has opened up a bit more, people now know what he\u2019s gone through and are happy that he\u2019s got through the other side of it and is playing great again.\u201d\n\nOne anecdote from Woods\u2019 week in Chiba, near Tokyo, sums up the dramatic Tiger transformation for McIlroy. During a rain delay at the Zozo Championship, Woods, 43, went to a local cinema with a crowd of players, including Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth and Bubba Watson, to watch Joker, then found himself stranded in a pizza parlour due to flooded roads.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that he never would have done,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cPreviously he didn\u2019t take the camaraderie of being one of the guys as seriously as he does now, as he transitions to this latter part of his career, where he\u2019s captaining teams and almost taking some of these guys like Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler under his wing. He\u2019s definitely mellowed as a person and probably sees the bigger picture more than he used to, and that\u2019s a great thing.\u201d", "description": "Rory McIlroy believes the sporting public is gaining even more satisfaction from the latest incarnation of \u201cTiger Woods, champion golfer\u201d because he has learned to \u201cmellow out\u201d and make himself more \u201copen\u201d.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000214588371-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwelFYFEmaOiKKzR4jgdD1MI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
