Show Hide A motion for a general election Boris Johnson has three options to try and call a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and 9 September and failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Johnson could try this again and potentially secure Labour backing, because the Benn act has removed the imminent possibility of a no-deal Brexit. A one-line bill This lowers the threshold of MPs needed to trigger a general election because it requires a simple majority to pass. This could work in Johnson\u2019s favour. However, it is amendable, which can involve the moving of an election date to a time that works for the opposition. A no-confidence motion The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, can call a no-confidence motion in the prime minister. This needs a simple majority to pass. He has been urged to do this by Johnson several times as a way of triggering an election, but Corbyn has resisted. It begins a 14-day period in which either the prime minister or someone else can try to form a new government. While Johnson could potentially lose this, and therefore his place as prime minister, to another Conservative, Corbyn could also struggle to get enough MPs to rally around him to form a government. The Scottish National party has said it would back him, but the Liberal Democrats have been extremely vocal in saying they would not support him. An election is triggered if, at the end of the two-week period, no alternative government has been formed. Kate Proctor Political correspondent\n\nThe UK\u2019s exit on the last day of the month had been the firmest of promises from the prime minister, Boris Johnson, the one he used as the centrepiece of his successful campaign for the Tory leadership over the summer.\n\nHis rival in the final round of the contest, Jeremy Hunt, was weak and prepared to delay Brexit, he told Tory members at dozens of hustings. By contrast, he was made of sterner stuff and would deliver Brexit on 31 October with \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d. He would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than delay it again, he declared after becoming PM.\n\nBut nothing to do with Brexit can be predicted; no promise cannot be broken. This weekend the Brexiters\u2019 champagne has been put on ice, the issue of the 50p coins is on hold, the ad campaign has been stalled, and chancellor Sajid Javid\u2019s first budget is erased from the government grid.\n\nThree years and four months on from the 2016 referendum, there is no set date on which Brexit will happen. On Sunday even Johnson himself is having to admit as much, as he tries to conceal his failure to deliver on time under a blizzard of blame.\n\nThe prime minister is warning on Sunday that Brexit may not happen even until well into next year. He blames parliament, and above all Jeremy Corbyn. MPs, he says, have taken the whole process \u201chostage\u201d. \u201cParliament\u2019s delay could take us to 31 January at least\u201d is his message.\n\nOnly 10 days ago, Johnson was at a Brussels summit proclaiming a \u201cgreat deal\u201d on the terms of the UK\u2019s exit with the EU. He had persuaded European leaders to reopen the withdrawal agreement negotiated under his predecessor, Theresa May, and had pushed them into scrapping the \u201cundemocratic\u201d Northern Irish backstop. Before the deal \u2013 but expecting to strike one \u2013 he had called an emergency sitting of parliament for last Saturday to seek MPs\u2019 approval for what he had negotiated. He knew he had to do so to avoid being forced by the Benn Act to write to Brussels to ask for another extension to Brexit until 31 January if there was no agreement by 11pm that day.\n\nBut from the moment Johnson left Brussels, nothing went to plan. First, parliament withheld its support for his Brexit deal on Saturday until the legislation on the UK\u2019s withdrawal had been thoroughly scrutinised and passed through both houses of parliament. He had been cornered by the Benn Act and wrote that evening to the EU asking for the extension he had promised never to request, though he also told Europeans in separate letters that he did not want one, and that delay would solve nothing.\n\nHis final gambit to try to meet the 31 October deadline \u2013 and make the extension unnecessary \u2013 was to put the withdrawal agreement bill before parliament last Tuesday, in the hope of getting it approved in time. In a rare victory for Johnson, MPs did vote in favour of giving the bill a second reading \u2013 meaning it could proceed to more detailed scrutiny.\n\nBut no sooner had his hopes of progress been raised than they were dashed again when the Commons rejected the PM\u2019s \u201ctimetable motion\u201d aimed at fast-tracking the whole bill through parliament in just a few days. From that moment his hopes were effectively dead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jeremy Corbyn leaves after speaking at an activists in Motherwell. Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA\n\nDowning Street was forced to change tack on Thursday, when Johnson wrote to Corbyn saying MPs had a \u201cduty to end this nightmare\u201d. In a dramatic move, Johnson said he would allow parliament more time to examine the Brexit legislation \u2013 but only if MPs agreed to hold a general election on 12 December.\n\nIt was a tall order and Downing Street knew it. For parliament to agree to a pre-Christmas election, two-thirds of MPs would need to vote in favour of it under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. Johnson needed Labour to support the idea of going to the country.\n\nThe pressure and the focus turned on to Corbyn, who for more than a year had been demanding a general election at every turn. Would he agree? But with Labour well behind the Conservatives in the polls (by 16 points in today\u2019s Opinium survey for the Observer) the prospect of an election, when actually offered, was not nearly as appealing as asking for one had been \u2013 and it was the last thing most Labour MPs wanted.\n\nCorbyn blew hot and cold on Thursday evening about how to react, before coming out more against a December election than for, fearing he would be walking into a trap.\n\nIn interviews he avoided direct answers, saying that, while he wanted an election desperately, he would not agree to one until a no-deal Brexit had been ruled out and also until the EU had given a response to the request from Johnson for a Brexit extension \u2013 which it is now expected to give early this week. On Saturday on a visit to Scotland, he made no direct reference to the Johnson offer.\n\nWith MPs and the country increasingly weary of the twists and turns and, above all, the political paralysis, the parliamentary drama will resume again on Monday. Johnson will table a motion calling for an election on 12 December. Corbyn is expected not to take up the offer. Labour is likely to order its MPs to abstain, meaning the motion will probably fall, whatever positions are taken by other parties, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats and the DUP.\n\nSo what then, MPs were asking themselves on Saturday. \u201cBy Monday we are likely to have no Brexit, no decision from the EU on an extension, and no general election,\u201d one senior Labour MP observed. \u201cWhere we go from there is anyone\u2019s guess. I have no idea.\u201d", "description": "The prime minister and the Labour leader faced huge problems as their strategies collapsed and they were forced to backtrack", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4957e09ad3a2da5a4d20aeeab6e9549eee43b6f/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f03e6caa45ff3b919633f0e9ba462dc1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
