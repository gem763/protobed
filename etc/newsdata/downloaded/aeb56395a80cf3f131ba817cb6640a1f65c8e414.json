The SDF blamed Turkish shelling for the security breach,\u201d the report added.\n\nReuters reported on Monday that Syrian government troops are deploying to Ain Issa, which is on the frontlines of the Turkish invasion.\n\nThe facility in Ain Issa is not technically a prison, but more along the lines of a well-guarded refugee camp. The UK Independent said on Sunday that most of the 785 escapees were \u201cISIS-affiliated women and children.\u201d The Irish Sun speculated one of them might have been Lisa Smith, an Irish national living at the camp with her daughter.\n\n\u201cOther than Kurdish sources, there was no other independent verification for the claim that hundreds of Isis members had fled Ain al-Issa,\u201d the Independent wrote.\n\nPresident Donald Trump addressed the reports of escaping ISIS prisoners in a string of Twitter posts on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cEurope had a chance to get their ISIS prisoners, but didn\u2019t want the cost. \u2018Let the USA pay,\u2019 they said. Kurds may be releasing some to get us involved,\u201d said Trump.\n\nTrump said any escapees would be \u201ceasily recaptured by Turkey or European nations from where many came, but they should move quickly.\u201d", "description": "Kurdish officials say hundreds of prisoners linked to ISIS escaped from a \"displacement camp\" due to a Turkish attack.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Ain-Issa-camp-escape-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
