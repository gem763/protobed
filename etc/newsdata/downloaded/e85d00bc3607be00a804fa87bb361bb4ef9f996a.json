Photo: Saturday Night Live/YouTube\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to make a single-serving Twitter account that becomes an instant classic, but a new one has managed to pull it off. Joining super-specific Twitter legends like the dearly missed @RipTornOutlives and the wonderful Brimley/Cocoon Line account, the newly created \u201cbill hader dancing to\u201d account has been making the rounds on everyone\u2019s feeds over the past month, and the hits just keep coming. Since posting its first tweet on September 17, @billhaderdancin has stayed true to its own beautiful simplicity: Use the same edited clip of Bill Hader dancing, and let whatever music your heart desires do the rest. The result has garnered the account plenty of coverage online \u2014 and it deserves it.\n\nHere\u2019s just a sampling of the account\u2019s collection of catchy, heartwarming goodness:\n\ndreams- fleetwood mac pic.twitter.com/Lr4WLNMEJ0 \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) September 29, 2019\n\nsuccession theme song pic.twitter.com/VNIUy2910q \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) October 1, 2019\n\nuptown girl- billy joel pic.twitter.com/yGpFx8ncam \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) September 27, 2019\n\ntoxic- britney spears pic.twitter.com/40zigUc3Cq \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) October 2, 2019\n\nmr. brightside- the killers pic.twitter.com/svgLux5JgN \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) October 3, 2019\n\ni wanna dance with somebody (who loves me)- whitney houston pic.twitter.com/vok8EBfSz2 \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) September 30, 2019\n\nwake me up before you go go- wham! pic.twitter.com/FSmYvxgEmB \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) October 1, 2019\n\nOne of the account\u2019s fans also happens to be a musician featured in one of the tweets \u2014 just the other day, @billhaderdancin received the certified Lizzo Stamp of Approval:\n\nIn case you\u2019re unfamiliar, the Hader clip is from a cut sketch SNL released in the summer of 2015 (he hosted the previous year) titled \u201cAlan,\u201d in which Hader plays the titular robot branded as \u201cthe future of casual entertainment,\u201d while a couple, played by Vanessa Bayer and Taran Killam, explore his capabilities. Much like the meme, the original sketch is very funny.", "description": "A new Twitter account has created the meme we needed right now: \u201cBill Hader Dancing to,\u201d where the \u2018SNL\u2019 alum dances to all kinds of music.
