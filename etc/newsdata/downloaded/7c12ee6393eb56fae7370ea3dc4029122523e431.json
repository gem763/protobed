The House of Commons speaker ruled a revote on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal improper after Saturday\u2019s vote, in which the Commons explicitly refused to authorize the deal until it gets the enabling legislation. \u201cIn substance,\u201d Bercow ruled, the new motion was identical to Saturday\u2019s vote on the Letwin amendment:\n\nThe Commons Speaker has refused a government request to hold a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d vote on its Brexit deal. John Bercow said a motion on the deal had already been brought before MPs on Saturday, and it would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly\u201d to debate it again. \u2026 He cited Parliament\u2019s rulebook, Erskine May, which says a motion that is the same \u201cin substance\u201d as a previous one cannot be brought back to the Commons during the course of a single parliamentary session. The Speaker also said the circumstances around the motion had not changed, so his ruling was \u201cnecessary\u2026 to ensure the sensible use of the House\u2019s time and proper respect for the decisions that it takes\u201d.\n\nBoris Johnson had hoped to get one last shot at a vote on the broad strokes of the agreement for at least one of two reasons. Had he gotten it through Parliament, Johnson could have claimed to have achieved Brexit, even if it took several weeks longer to implement. Or, just a tad more conspiratorially, Johnson could have used the passage to ask for the withdrawal of the Benn Act letter that requested the extension, and then simply stalled past October 31 to create a default no-deal Brexit without any of the concessions in his latest deal.\n\nThat option is now moot, unless the EU decides not to give Johnson an extension and allows him to execute his no-deal strategy. That seems very unlikely, although France has been openly griping about the idea of a new extension. Johnson\u2019s attempt to sour prospects for the extension by not signing the Benn Act letter \u2014 and sending a personal note arguing against it \u2014 had \u201cno consequences\u201d for the EU\u2019s consideration of an extension, Donald Tusk commented over the weekend.\n\nGermany\u2019s finance minister agreed with Tusk and said the extension was all but guaranteed:\n\nThe unconventional \u201cform\u201d of Boris Johnson\u2019s extension request is irrelevant to the EU, the European commission has confirmed, as Germany\u2019s finance minister said \u201cit goes without saying\u201d that a further Brexit delay would be granted. Peter Altmaier, a key ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said he believed either a technical extension to allow extra-time for legislation to pass, or a longer period to accommodate a general election or second referendum would be offered. \u201cWe have already twice agreed to an extension. I have repeatedly said as my own opinion I am not ideologically opposed to extending again a few days or a few weeks if you then certainly get a good solution that excludes a hard Brexit\u201d, Altmaier said. \u201dIf the British are to opt for one of the longer-term options, that is new elections or a new referendum, then it goes without saying that the European Union should do it, for me anyway.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, the first ministers of the parliaments in Wales and Scotland sent their own letters imploring the EU to extend the Article 50 deadline. Even if this deal passes, Mark Drakeford and Nicola Sturgeon wrote, their legislatures will need time to implement it before being cut off from the EU:\n\nToday @NicolaSturgeon and I have written a joint letter to the PM urging UK Gov to secure an extension from the European Council that respects devolution and allows our legislatures to carry out their proper constitutional and democratic functions. pic.twitter.com/oKoJ8je8tE \u2014 Mark Drakeford (@fmwales) October 21, 2019\n\nWith ten days to go until the Brexit deadline of October 31st, Mr Drakeford said Parliament could \u201cnot in any way adequately undertake the scrutiny of the Bill in 1 0 day period\u201d. \u201cThis is a concern we fully share. It is simply impossible for us to fulfil our constitutional responsibilities in this timescale. \u201cAn extension would allow us to adequately scrutinise the agreement.\u201d\n\nBoth also penned a letter to Johnson, in which they describe his deal as \u201ceven more damaging\u201d than Theresa May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement. That doesn\u2019t bode well for the unity of the United Kingdom after Brexit of either kind:\n\nToday @NicolaSturgeon and I have written a joint letter to the PM urging UK Gov to secure an extension from the European Council that respects devolution and allows our legislatures to carry out their proper constitutional and democratic functions. pic.twitter.com/oKoJ8je8tE \u2014 Mark Drakeford (@fmwales) October 21, 2019\n\nEven an extension won\u2019t be the worst possible outcome for Johnson, although it\u2019s hardly optimal and would be a serious tactical loss. It could set up a national snap election on the basis of either this deal or a no-deal Brexit, if the EU offers a long enough extension. As long as Labour leaves Jeremy Corbyn in charge as potential PM, Johnson has a significant advantage, and his determination to fulfill the original referendum decision will no doubt give Tories a boost as well.\n\nHowever, this might well be a Pyrrhic victory, assuming it plays out Johnson\u2019s way at all. The warning signals from Scotland and Wales strongly suggest that the flames of nationalism fanned by Johnson and his Brexiters might have already gone too far to keep the United Kingdom\u2019s four nations, well, united. His deal undermined the Unionist identity in Northern Ireland as well by dropping a border in the Irish Sea, leaving them feeling betrayed and demoralized. The end result of Brexit might well be a united Ireland and a disunited kingdom across the Irish Sea border within a decade or less. Such are the risks of nationalism and reclaimed sovereignty in a country that advertises itself as a union of four nations.\n\nUpdate: This was an ugly surprise for some, and almost certainly a deal-killer in Parliament:\n\nNorthern Irish businesses will have to complete exit declarations when sending goods to Great Britain under the terms of the government\u2019s Brexit deal, Stephen Barclay said today. The U.K. Brexit secretary told peers on the House of Lords European Union committee: \u201cThe exit summary declarations will be required in terms of NI to GB.\u201d Barclay was correcting an earlier answer he gave to the committee, when he said he did not think such forms would be required under Johnson\u2019s deal. Barclay initially told peers: \u201cWe\u2019ve said in terms of [trade] from NI to GB that it will be frictionless and so there wouldn\u2019t be [declaration forms].\u201d Barclay\u2019s admission reveals that trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland would be subject to new paperwork under the terms of Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nIn other words, that border in the Irish Sea to which Johnson agreed in this deal is a real customs border, which is \u2026 inevitable with Brexit. Pulling out of a customs and regulatory union requires a border; the only question is where it goes. The EU wouldn\u2019t countenance it in Ireland, and the Good Friday Agreement forbids it, so Johnson put it in the only place left to him \u2014 a move that even Theresa May tried to forestall with the backstop.\n\nNigel Farage is furious:\n\nGoods going from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK would need export declaration forms. It\u2019s now clear that @BorisJohnson is prepared to wreck the United Kingdom to get this EU treaty through. No wonder the DUP are unhappy. https://t.co/b6rjWyi8TU \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) October 21, 2019\n\nBrexit itself will eventually wreck the UK, but Farage is correct in arguing that this will expedite matters considerably. If Northern Ireland is no longer British, then why shouldn\u2019t it just be Irish?\n\nUpdate: Jacob Rees-Mogg told Parliament that the enabling legislation will be ready for a vote in three days, allowing for full approval in accord with the Letwin amendment:\n\nIf the bill passes second reading tomorrow \u2013 the first key vote on it \u2013 MPs will then get the chance to vote on the programme motion setting out this accelerated timetable. \u2014 Heather Stewart (@GuardianHeather) October 21, 2019\n\nThe revelation about Northern Ireland will likely kill this deal, however. The DUP won\u2019t vote for it, and it might lose the handful of Labour MPs that crossed over on the Letwin vote. Tomorrow\u2019s vote will make that clear one way or the other.", "description": "\"Disquiet and consternation\" ensues.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bercow.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
