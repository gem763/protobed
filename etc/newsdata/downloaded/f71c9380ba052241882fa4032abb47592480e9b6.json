No, siree!\n\nHere\u2019s an exclusive preview of a longer interview I did with him this week about his book about identity politics, The Madness of Crowds. We discuss, inter alia, our irritation at the way the cult of the rainbow flag has come to dominate the entirety of Western culture.\n\nGay Pride March, he complains, has turned into \u201cGay Pride Day into Gay Pride Weekend into Gay Pride Week into Gay Pride Month\u2026\u201d\n\nHe says:\n\n\u201cMy bank had rainbows everywhere in Gay Pride month. \u2018Love happens here\u2019 was the rather sick-making slogan. Now I don\u2019t want love to happen at my bank. I don\u2019t want sex at my bank. I just want there to be more people on the tills. I want them to cash a cheque faster than they do. I want them not to charge me \u00a35 when I lose my bank statement. I don\u2019t want them in the business of love.\u201d", "description": "Author Douglas Murray is gay, but in an interview with James Delingpole he reveals he doesn't think much of Gay Pride.
