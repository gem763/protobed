We believe that there is a good chance of realising substantial value for our investment in Stackla. However, the ongoing effect on the business of the temporary denial of access to the Facebook platform is not yet clear.\"\n\nStackla's user-generated content platform lets marketers easily search social media for people who have posted positive content about their clients so that they can seek permission to use it in their own marketing.\n\nThe start-up only collects public content, not private content, but Facebook blocked it and other firms when it cracked down on companies \"scraping\" user data in August.\n\nBailador, which is run by David Kirk and Paul Wilson, had previously valued its stake in the business at $12.6 million - the equal third most valuable position.\n\nIn the statement to the ASX, the fund said that when it first invested in Stackla, it relied less on its access to Instagram data.\n\n\"When Bailador invested in Stackla, Instagram was a much smaller part of the overall content sourced by Stackla than it is today. As Instagram's dominance has grown, this created greater reliance on content from this platform in particular for Stackla,\" the statement said.\n\nDespite not reinstating its previous valuation, Bailador flagged that Mr Wilson was still the chairman of the firm and it would stay close to the start-up and continue to evaluate its position.\n\nThe company also announced on Monday that it had lowered its valuation on online video platform Viostram to nil, having previously valued it at $7.8 million.", "description": "The future is looking brighter for content marketing start-up Stackla, but its key investor still wants to see a turnaround before upping its valuation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3116%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_464/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e973cd8c46242b827724e8971394b6559b494bab", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
