It discourages firms from giving adequate notice of closure and it discourages new investment in firm and flexible plant.\"\n\nThe comments come as Origin Energy chief executive Frank Calabria will question the whole structure of the market and whether it provides for the \"orderly\" exit of coal-fired generation and its replacement by firm, dispatchable power.\n\n\"We have some hard questions to ask in the coming years with the next tranche of exits coming up in 2022 and 2023,\" Mr Calabria will tell the summit, saying customers cannot again be exposed to the power price shocks caused by the closure of the Hazelwood and Northern coal generators in Victoria and South Australia, respectively.\n\n\"Without a market signal in place for carbon that will get investment flowing in firming generation, we are unfortunately at the point that we need to start questioning market design and whether government needs to take more responsibility for investment, something we haven\u2019t needed in the past 21 years of the NEM,\" Mr Calabria will say.\n\n'Victoria is not willing to wait'\n\nMeanwhile, Victoria's Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio is set to reveal she is moving to bypass the federal government and lock in emergency back-up power supplies for the state more cheaply than under the market operator's emergency system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs D'Ambrosio will use the summit to announce that rather than waiting for national energy rules to change, Victoria would seek an exemption to allow multi-year contracts to be negotiated for back-up power that would reduce the risk of failures of ageing coal generators.\n\n\"We\u2019re breaking free from the federal government\u2019s outdated rules and getting it done ourselves,\" says the Victorian minister.\n\n\u201cVictoria is not willing to wait on the sidelines when it comes to planning for our energy future \u2013 which is why we\u2019re breaking free from the federal government\u2019s outdated rules and getting it done ourselves,\" Ms D'Ambrosio will say, renewing criticism of Mr Taylor's delay in calling a COAG Energy Council, now due to be held in November.\n\n\"Given Mr Taylor has only scheduled this vital meeting just before summer hits, the Labor government has no choice but to act now to help support Victorians for the summer ahead.\"\n\nThe minister's words add fuel to an ongoing war of words between the Victorian and federal governments over what needs to be done to secure the state's power supply after an influx of renewables and worsening conditions for baseload coal plants.\n\nMr Taylor said federal, state and territory governments needed to focus on practical action to fix the issues caused by the rapid influx of renewable energy into the grid.\n\n\"It's time to accept the facts, put the proselytising behind us and knuckle down to solve the biggest problems that confront us,\" Mr Taylor will say in his speech.\n\n\"This means balancing the unprecedented investment in intermittent renewables with attracting and retaining reliable, affordable on-demand generation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Reckless targets will end badly'\n\n\"In the short to medium term, the only realistic options to do most of that balancing are coal, gas and hydro.\"\n\nMr Taylor, who has had a running battle with the Victorian and Queensland governments over their ambitious renewable energy targets, reaffirmed his call to scrap them.\n\nHe said any move to double down on more aggressive renewable energy or emissions targets and subsidies was \"policy insanity\".\n\n\"Reckless targets will end badly, and we believe \u2013 as does the ACCC \u2013 they need to be scaled down and phased out. The low and falling costs of solar, in particular, will ensure enough renewable investment to smash our targets.\"\n\nMr Taylor will say governments needed to focus on creating strong signals to invest in dispatchable capacity, particularly in Victoria, South Australia and NSW, where reserves are low.\n\n\"Doing so will not just improve reliability and security \u2013 it will put downward pressure on prices.\"\n\nBut, just as importantly, Mr Taylor will say there also needed to be steps to ensure \"like-for-like replacement\" for coal- and gas-fired power stations when they closed, such as Liddell which is due to shut in early 2023 \u2013 or possibly extending their life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Some vague hope of transmission, intermittent generation and demand management filling the gap is not good enough,\" he said.\n\n\"For too long this industry has suffered from the triumph of hope over reality. Not this time. The goal must be to create a sensible precedent for how we deal with planned closures in the future.\"\n\nMr Taylor will also use his speech to push for day-ahead markets for energy participants to bring Australia in line with most European and North American markets as well as strengthening the Frequency Control and Ancillary Service markets in the NEM.\n\nMs D'Ambrosio has blamed federal government, industry regulators and policymakers for outdated rules in the electricity market that are putting security of supply at risk, while Mr Taylor blames Victoria's ambitious targets for renewable energy and emissions reductions.\n\n\"While AEMO [Australian Energy Market Operator] has forecast that Victoria\u2019s huge renewable energy push will greatly improve energy supply in the coming years, the existing privatised coal generators can\u2019t be relied upon not to breakdown during prolonged periods of hot weather,\" Ms D'Ambrosio will say.\n\n\"This is why the Labor government has taken action, requesting an exemption from the Australian Energy Market Commission to allow AEMO the option of negotiating longer [emergency reserve] contracts, where it\u2019s cheaper to do so.\"", "description": "The Morrison government is on a collision course with its top energy policy advisor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2907%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_349/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d2c978400fe7df8dd0d4ee99fab760058c82ce48", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
