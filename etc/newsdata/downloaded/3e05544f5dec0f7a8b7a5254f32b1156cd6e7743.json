I felt sorry for them in some ways,' Carragher told Sky Sports' Friday Night Football.\n\n\u2018Some of those players there were a disgrace really. You don\u2019t see 9-0. What is the backbone in this team?\n\n'A disgraceful performance \u2013 that\u2019s one of the worst performances of any team in Premier League history.'\n\nIt doesn't get any easier for the stricken Saints, with a Carabao Cup tie at Manchester City on Tuesday followed by another game against the champions at the Etihad next Saturday.\n\nLeicester's Jamie Vardy (centre) notched a hat-trick, as did team-mate Ayoze Perez (right)\n\n'Their confidence will be absolutely shot,' Carragher continued.\n\n'You fear for them going there [at City]. They go there and if they get beat 4-0, they\u2019ll be happy. They'l be thinking, \"please don\u2019t embarrass ourselves again.\"'\n\nEx-Manchester United defender Gary Neville was equally critical of Southampton's torrid display.\n\nSky Sports duo Carragher and Neville gave a damning verdict of Southampton's display\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a system of play that if you\u2019re not good at it you\u2019ll be beat badly,' Neville explained. \u2018You look at Southampton and they look so fragile. There\u2019s a couple of young players who will need taking out after that game.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no excuse for some of them. The stadium must have had 5-6,000 at the end.\n\n'He needs to give them a couple days away. I\u2019ve had a defeat like that in Spain, it\u2019s hard.'", "description": "Ralph Hasenhuttl called it a 'no-performance' afterwards, and Carragher went in on the home team's display, and feared for them ahead of a double-header at Man City next week.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/23/20200504-0-image-a-42_1572042920430.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
