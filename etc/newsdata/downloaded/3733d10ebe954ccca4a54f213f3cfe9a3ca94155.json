GM -0.29% in more than a decade lasted a third day, and many on the picket line Wednesday\u2014including some hired since the last stoppage\u2014said they are prepared to stay away longer.\n\nThe UAW called on nearly 46,000 full-time GM workers to walk off the job on Monday after negotiations for a new four-year labor agreement hit a standstill. Union negotiators are pressing GM to keep idled plants open, increase pay and benefits for less-senior workers and provide more job security for temporary workers, who are also striking.\n\n\u201cIt feels good, it feels like we\u2019re making history,\u201d said Satoria Kemp, 27, who said she has worked for three years as a temporary worker in a GM truck-assembly plant in Flint, Mich.\n\nGM is hoping to keep its labor costs down as sales slow, and it also seeks to clamp down on rising health-care costs. Auto-industry analysts estimate that the strike could dent GM\u2019s profit by between $50 million and $100 million daily.\n\nNegotiations between the company and the union continued on Wednesday. But the strike was seen as likely to enter a fourth day, according to a person familiar with the matter. It is already the longest nationwide strike against GM since the 1970s.\n\nThe walkout is a first for many workers who were hired after the last recession, as U.S. auto industry sales rebounded and GM expanded factory output. More than 40% of the unionized workforce at Detroit\u2019s three main auto makers has never experienced an industry downturn, according to industry sources.\n\nMs. Kemp said she typically brings home around $700 weekly working six days a week at the plant. But because of the walkout, she is no longer getting paid by the company.\n\nShut Down Strikes by UAW workers at GM plants have been relatively rare this century.

The payments come from a union strike fund, which earlier this year exceeded $750 million.\n\nMs. Kemp said the pay sacrifice is worth it if it means getting a contract that will give her a certain path to full-time employment. She said it is difficult as a temporary worker to see full-time workers doing the same job, while getting more pay, profit-sharing bonuses and other benefits not offered to her. She said this is her first strike.\n\nThe industry wants more flexibility and auto executives have argued that restrictions on temporary workers put U.S. car makers at a competitive disadvantage. Temporary workers account for about 7% of GM\u2019s U.S. factory workforce, compared with more than 20% for foreign-owned car plans, according to industry data.\n\nAt the union hall for Local 598 across the street from the Flint plant, workers sit at long tables filling out paperwork for health insurance and strike pay. In exchange for the union benefits, workers agree to walk the picket line for one shift a week.\n\nLocal 598 is the area\u2019s largest, representing around 5,000 workers, according to the local\u2019s financial secretary, Chad Fabbro. With that many workers, Mr. Fabbro said, the local can count on having 250 workers on the picket lines at any given time.\n\nAnalysts estimate the strike could dent GM\u2019s profit by between $50 million and $100 million daily.

A sign at a nearby credit union advertises that it is willing to offer assistance to workers affected by the strike.\n\nSome workers said that if the strike continues, they might look to work other jobs. If they did, they said, they would still commit to coming out to the picket lines.\n\nThe strike is a first even for some longtime employees.\n\nEddie Kennedy, 38, said he was hired at GM\u2019s Detroit-Hamtramck plant in 2008, shortly after the last nationwide strike. He said he was on the cusp of becoming a \u201ctraditional\u201d worker and earning more than he currently does as a second-tier or \u201cin-progression\u201d worker. The strike has delayed that.\n\n\u201cIt got cut off this month,\u201d said Mr. Kennedy. \u201cI\u2019m probably in the closest group to transition.\u201d\n\nYet Mr. Kennedy, who said he had never been on strike before, said he feels the strike is worthwhile.\n\nDetroit-Hamtramck is one of the assembly plants scheduled for closure under GM\u2019s current restructuring plans, first announced last year. He hopes the strike will strengthen the union\u2019s hand in negotiations and potentially allow it to deliver a commitment from GM to keep the plant open.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very comfortable with it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do what we\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\n\u2014Nora Naughton contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Ben Foldy at Ben.Foldy@wsj.com", "description": "The first strike called by the United Auto Workers against General Motors Co. in more than a decade lasted a third day, and many on the picket line Wednesday\u2014including some hired since the last stoppage\u2014said they are prepared to stay away longer.", "authors": ["Ben Foldy", "Ben.Foldy Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108372/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
