AAP\n\nThe man parachuted in to fix Adam Neumann's mess for major investor Softbank is new WeWork chairman Marcelo Claure. Whose career has often moved in tandem with that of his mentor, ex-Telstra boss Sol Trujillo.\n\nThe friendship is well-known in Australian telco circles, having become a bit of a political issue in 2005. Almost immediately after being appointed at Telstra, Trujillo awarded a $30 million a year contract to Claure's phone distribution business Brightstar. The usual tender process was scrapped, and John Howard was forced to affirm his \"confidence\" in the new chief. David Thodey substantially scaled down Telstra's Brightstar relationship upon his appointment.\n\nBut the Trujillo-Claure relationship continued.\n\nIn 2014, Trujillo and a dozen telco consultants shared in at least $US25 million ($36.8 million) for five months' work at Softbank-controlled telco Sprint, where Claure is chief executive. The hefty pay cheque came despite the fact that most of the recommendations made by Trujillo and his team were never implemented, according to a 2015 report in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd in 2016, Trujillo became a director of now-defunct ad-tech startup Unlockd. Which launched in the US through a partnership with Boost Mobile, one of Sprint's subsidiaries.\n\nSo what do you reckon are the odds Trujillo will turn up at WeWork soon?", "description": "What do you reckon are the odds Trujillo will turn up at WeWork soon?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6146%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_162/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/eccf4bba115b4fc63070390b9a37f65dd0ba3d0e", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
