The Straits Times\n\nThe Anti-Fake News Act (AFNA) has been repealed by the Malaysian Parliament yet again, the second time in a span of 14 months.\n\nAccording to The Star, the Bill was passed when 92 MPs voted for the law to be abolished while 51 were against it after two days of debates and resistance by the Barisan Nasional (BN) opposition.\n\nIt was Pakatan Harapan\u2019s (PH) second attempt at repealing the AFNA since coming into power in May 2018, as it was rejected by the BN coalition-controlled Upper House last year.\n\nUnder Article 68 of the Malaysian Federal Constitution, the Bill cannot be rejected again as the Upper House cannot block what has been approved by MPs for a second time. Even if there is an attempt to block it in Senate, the Bill will automatically be passed to the King for approval.\n\nAccording to the Bill, the provision to repeal the AFNA was due to a change in government policy that fake news can be combated with existing laws.\n\nAccording to Bernama, Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department Mohamed Hanipa, said during the parliamentary debate that the PH government was committed to repealing the Act because it \u201cdid not want anyone to be victimised by it\u201d.\n\nHe said that \u201cit has elements that are draconian and can be abused\u201d and added that while one person was charged and punished under the act while BN was in power, no cases were tried under PH rule.\n\nOffensive remark\n\nThe Star reported that at one point, Mohamed Hanipa was interjected by MP Datuk Seri Azalina Othman, who took her time to look for her glasses before speaking, and said that \u201cI want to see you (referring to Hanipa) clearly, sometimes you look big, sometimes you look small\u201c.\n\nTo this, Hanipa replied: \u201cSometimes even I can\u2019t differentiate if you are a woman or a man\u201d. This resulted in several opposition MPs jeering Hanipa, calling him an \u201cirresponsible and low-class deputy minister\u201d.\n\nDatuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong also stood up and said: \u201cHe (Hanipa) clearly made a sexist remark and questioned the gender of a lawmaker. He must retract the statement\u201d.\n\nEventually, Deputy Speaker Datuk Mohd Rashid Hasnon ordered Hanipa to retract his statement, to which he obliged.\n\nTwo opposition MPs then called for Rashid Hasnon to proceed with the vote without the need to hear Hanipa\u2019s replies, as it would have resulted in a more heated exchange.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - During the debate, the minister told a female politician he could not tell if she was a man or a woman..
