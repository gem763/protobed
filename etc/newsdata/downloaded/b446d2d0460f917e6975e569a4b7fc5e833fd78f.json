The settlement, unveiled in July, offers the 147 million consumers affected by the massive 2017 breach a choice between 10 years of free credit monitoring or $125 in cash.\n\nBut now applicants are learning they have to show they already have \u201csome form of credit monitoring or protection in place\u201d to stand any chance at any cash offered in the settlement.\n\nOver the weekend, people seeking the $125 started receiving emails from settlement administrators saying they must verify they \u201chad some form of credit monitoring or protection in place and will continue to have the credit monitoring in place for a minimum of six months.\u201d\n\nThat notice was the latest piece of bad news for people who were hoping to get some cash from the settlement. In late July, the Federal Trade Commission said victims of the breach would be better off going for the free credit monitoring instead of the cash because there\u2019s only $31 million earmarked for the $125 individual payments, so individual payouts could end up being a lot smaller than $125.\n\nThe FTC said people should take the credit monitoring because it\u2019s a better value compared to any money reward. Many consumers are eligible for free credit monitoring because it\u2019s frequently offered to people who\u2019ve been victims of large data breaches, like the ones suffered by Equifax, Capital One COF, +0.96% and Marriott. MAR, +1.37% Those who must pay for the service can expect to pay from about $19 to more than $30 a month, according to The Balance and NerdWallet.\n\nVictims of the Equifax breach have until Oct. 15 to either name the credit monitoring service they were using when they filed their claim for the cash, or change their claim to ask for free credit monitoring instead of the $125, according to the email from settlement administrators.\n\nIf claimants don\u2019t do one thing or another by Oct. 15, their bid for money will be denied, the email warned.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: FTC warns about fake Equifax sites popping up after company agreed to $700M payout\n\n\u201cBased on the number of potentially valid claims that have been submitted to date, payments of these benefits likely will be substantially lowered and will be distributed on a proportional basis if the settlement becomes final,\u201d the email added. \u201cDepending on the number of valid claims that are filed, the amount you receive for alternative compensation may be a small percentage of your initial claim.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the proposed settlement unveiled in July did mention the strings attached to the $125 cash payment.\n\nClass-action members \u201cmust identify the monitoring service and certify that he or she has some form of credit monitoring or protection as of the date\u201d they submit their claim and vouch they \u201cwill have such credit monitoring in place for a minimums of six (6) months from the claim date,\u201d the settlement terms said.\n\nGovernment regulators and plaintiffs lawyers insist the free credit monitoring is a great deal \u2014 now more than ever considering how money for \u201calternative compensation\u201d in this settlement is getting stretched thin.\n\nThe free credit monitoring consists of four years of free credit monitoring from all three credit bureaus, Equifax EFX, -3.11%, TransUnion TRU, -3.37% and Experian EXPN, -4.08% . After that, applicants can get six more years of free credit monitoring from Equifax. The retail price for this amount of monitoring is $1,920 per person, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have previously said.\n\nThere\u2019s a Jan. 22, 2020 final deadline for people to submit a claim for free credit monitoring or \u201calternative reimbursement compensation.\u201d\n\nThe settlement also offers up to $20,000 \u201cfor documented losses fairly traceable to the breach,\u201d court papers said. But experts say consumers have a challenging task if they want to prove the breach was directly responsible for monetary losses.\n\nThe FTC, Equifax and the settlement administrator, JND Legal Administration, could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nEquifax shares are up 55% from the start of the year. Meanwhile the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.03% has increased more than 18% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.28% has gained nearly 15%.", "description": "The Equifax data breach settlement money comes with strings attached.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FU078_equifa_ZG_20170911233740.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
