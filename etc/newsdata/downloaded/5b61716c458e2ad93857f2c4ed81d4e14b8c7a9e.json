The Washington Times takes a weekly look at some of them that may have flown under the radar.\n\nPete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, on Thursday released a health care proposal he described as \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d that could put the country on a \u201cglide path\u201d to a universal \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system.\n\n\u201cThis gives Americans a choice,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cIf you prefer a public plan like Medicare \u2014 like I think most Americans will \u2014 you can choose it. But if you prefer to keep your private insurance, you can.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg joins 2020 candidates such as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Sen. Michael Bennet, who have advocated for a public insurance option to compete with private plans.\n\nThat\u2019s a contrast to Sen. Bernard Sanders\u2019 government-run vision, which would eliminate private insurance altogether.\n\nMr. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, though, said if private insurers don\u2019t offer something better, the mayor\u2019s proposal would create a \u201cnatural glide path\u201d to a government takeover of the health care system.\n\nUnder his plan, eligible people would be automatically enrolled in Medicaid or the public option. Other people who can\u2019t afford coverage would receive subsidies, either for private insurance or for the public alternative.\n\nIt would cap premium payments at 8.5% of income.\n\nThe plan seeks to lower costs by banning health care providers from charging more than twice what Medicare would pay for the same service out-of-network and capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors enrolled in traditional Medicare, among other priorities.\n\nO\u2019Rourke on marijuana\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas on Thursday released a plan to legalize marijuana at the federal level that includes a proposal to dole out monthly grants to people formerly incarcerated for marijuana-related offenses.\n\n\u201cWe need to not only end the prohibition on marijuana but also repair the damage done to the communities of color disproportionately locked up in our criminal justice system or locked out of opportunity because of the War on Drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nHe would impose a new federal tax on the marijuana industry, with the proceeds going toward a monthly \u201cdrug war justice grant\u201d to those who had been imprisoned for nonviolent marijuana-related offenses, reentry services for formerly incarcerated people and substance abuse treatment programs.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke also would seek to end the federal prohibition on marijuana and remove it from the controlled substances list. He would model a regulatory system along the lines of what\u2019s used for alcohol, limiting sales to adults and investing in marijuana \u201cbreathalyzer\u201d technology and ignition interlock devices.\n\nHe also would end \u201ccannabis-related\u201d charges as grounds for deportation or denial of citizenship.\n\nSanders on housing\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders on Wednesday released a $2.5 trillion plan intended to guarantee affordable housing to every American.\n\nHe vowed a nearly $1.5 trillion investment in a national \u201caffordable housing trust fund\u201d to build or rehabilitate about 7.4 million housing units.\n\n\u201cThere is virtually no place in America where a full-time minimum-wage worker can afford a decent two-bedroom apartment,\u201d said the senator from Vermont. \u201cAt a time when half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, this is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders also would impose a national cap on annual rent increases to no more than 3%, or 1.5% times the consumer price index, and implement new \u201cjust cause\u201d requirements for evictions in an effort to prevent people from getting kicked out of their apartments for \u201carbitrary\u201d reasons.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019 campaign also said he would fully fund federal Section 8 rental assistance for lower-income families at $410 billion over the next decade.\n\nThe plan also includes a 25% \u201chouse flipping tax\u201d for investors who sell a non-owner-occupied property for more than it was purchased within five years, and a 2% \u201cempty homes\u201d tax on owned but vacant homes.\n\nHis campaign said the broader proposal would be paid for by imposing a new tax on the top 0.1% of earners.\n\nBooker on labor rights\n\nSen. Cory A. Booker on Wednesday introduced a plan intended to bolster workers\u2019 rights and labor unions that included new rules of the road for collective bargaining and independent contractors.\n\nMr. Booker\u2019s plan entails supporting legislation to make it easier for people to join a union, protecting employees\u2019 right to strike, banning right-to-work laws, and supporting \u201csectoral\u201d bargaining across multiple employers in the same industry.\n\nHe also wants a new federal minimum wage of $15 per hour and new rules so that \u201cgig\u201d workers at companies such as Uber aren\u2019t classified as independent contractors.\n\nThe New Jersey Democrat tied his proposals to the ongoing United Automobile Workers union strike at General Motors.\n\n\u201cI learned the power of collective action from my grandfather who was an assembly line worker and UAW union rep in Detroit,\u201d Mr. Booker said. \u201cHe showed me how, when workers stick together, injustices can be corrected and real progress can be made.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
