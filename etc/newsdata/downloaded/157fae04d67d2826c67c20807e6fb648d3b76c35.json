Biden shielded his son from a probe into profiteering in that country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the United Nations. \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d\n\nA government whistleblower has accused Mr. Trump of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter and his post with a Ukrainian gas company. The talks came about the same time the U.S. was debating whether to release $250 million in military aid to the country fighting a long-running incursion from Russian-backed forces.\n\nMr. Trump said Mr. Zelensky came into office last year promising reforms.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons the new president got elected is he was going to stop corruption,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSo it\u2019s very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption.\u201d\n\nHe said of Mr. Biden, \u201cWhat Biden did was wrong.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also said Hunter Biden \u201ctook a lot of money from China.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden boasted in a speech last year that he threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine in 2015 unless its leaders fired the country\u2019s top prosecutor, who had inherited a probe of the gas company. Mr. Biden and other Obama administration officials asserted that the former prosecutor wasn\u2019t doing enough to stop corruption generally.\n\nMr. Trump has said he\u2019s considering releasing the transcript of his phone conversations with the Ukraine president. Democrats are threatening that they might consider it an impeachable offense if Mr. Trump was digging for dirt on a political rival from a foreign leader.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
