I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a woman in the world who hasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years; it was very normalised when I first started.\n\n'It was almost a condition of employment to look the other way about comments, or even things that were more egregious. That\u2019s why [The Morning Show] is really interesting \u2013 it addresses the systemic abuse of power. How did it get so out of hand?'\n\nJennifer, 50, added: 'I\u2019m aware that I have had a pretty easy time in terms of my experience in the business. But even back on Friends, it wasn\u2019t so much about women being paid the same as men \u2013 some of the women were being paid more.\n\n'It was more about, \u201cWe\u2019re doing equal work and we all deserve to be compensated in the same way.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t feel good going to work knowing someone was getting x amount and I was getting something greater.'\n\nShedding light: The pair spoke to Radio Times about their own (very different) experiences with male harassment in the creative industry\n\nComing soon: The Morning Show takes a behind-the-scenes look at morning talk shows in New York - and all the power struggles, feelings of guilt and personal drama women in the industry go through\n\nReese added: 'Ashley Judd said something very astute: \u201cWho was I going to report it to back then? The invisible DA [District Attorney] of Hollywood?\u201d Women were siloed off in Hollywood.\n\n'Usually, there was only one woman in each project, so we weren\u2019t meeting each other or working together. On a film, I\u2019d very frequently be the only woman on set. That was for 29 years of my career. It\u2019s only really changed in the last five years.'\n\nOf the progression in recent years, Reese went on: 'There\u2019s a need for new, fresher storytelling and that has changed the way stories are being made,' Reese told Radio Times this week.\n\nJennifer added: 'I\u2019m aware that I have had a pretty easy time in terms of my experience in the business'\n\nReese added: 'Ashley Judd said something very astute: \u201cWho was I going to report it to back then? The invisible DA [District Attorney] of Hollywood?\u201d Women were siloed off in Hollywood'\n\n'Jen and I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to make this show 10 years ago \u2013 but now people are taking [women] more seriously as creators and producers.'\n\nThe duo are executive producing the series, as well as leading the star-filled cast list.\n\n'When we pitched the show the #MeToo movement hadn\u2019t even begun so we\u2019ve had to regroup and redirect the show to include all that stuff,' Jennifer said. 'We want it to be raw and honest and vulnerable and messy, and not black and white.\n\nOut now: This week's Radio Times is on sale now\n\n'Incredible things have happened in the past couple of years that were long overdue. It\u2019s been a very exciting time and you can see the changes regarding women being objectified, and regarding power and positions of power.\n\n'And I feel a lot more will come to the surface, because people are doing their homework and digging deep into everybody\u2019s underwear drawer.'\n\nReese added: 'We have a female showrunner and several women on our writing team representing different ideas of what it means to be a woman in the world.\n\n'I think it\u2019s crazy that it\u2019s just happening now, but the emergence of streaming has opened up the possibilities for new storytellers in television.'\n\nThe Morning Show takes a behind-the-scenes look at morning talk shows in New York - and all the power struggles, feelings of guilt and personal drama women in the industry go through.\n\nThis week's Radio Times is on sale now.", "description": "Having played sisters on Friends, they've reunited to front their new Apple TV+ series The Morning Show.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/17/19999876-0-image-a-4_1571677088084.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
