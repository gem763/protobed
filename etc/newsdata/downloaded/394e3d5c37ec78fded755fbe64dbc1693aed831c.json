Among the counts are charges of sexual intercourse with a minor, oral copulation with a minor and showing porn to a child.\n\nShe could receive up to four years in prison after pleading guilty to 21 felony offences in California last Tuesday.\n\nProsecutors say the abuse began in September 2017 against a 15-year-old boy before she began molesting a 14-year-old boy in the first week of October 2017.\n\nOne of the victims said they had sex with the predator three times, the last time on October 5, 2017, but stopped the sordid meetings because of feelings of guilt towards Lytle's husband.\n\nLytle used to pick up the victims in her car from parks and even from the boys' own homes after she asked one of the victims to sneak out at night.\n\nShe took the victim back to her house and sexually abused him, before dropping him back at his home at around 5am.\n\nThe sexual abuse was reportedly uncovered when one of the victims' parents found nudes on the boy's phone that Lytle had sent to him.\n\nThe woman blamed her behavior on low self-esteem and the death of her sister, which she said had left her feeling depressed.\n\nRecords show that Lytle's husband filed divorce paperwork within days of her arrest. She now reportedly goes by the surname Blain.\n\nThe woman blamed her behavior on low self-esteem and the death of her sister, which she said had left her feeling depressed. She has spent the past two years in and out of court\n\nTuesday was the second time Lytle was set to plea to the alleged crimes. In April, Judge Joseph Kalashian reconsidered an agreement that in exchange for a guilty plea, Lytle would be handed a six-year suspended prison sentence - which would have meant no time behind bars.\n\nBut, after receiving the probation report, Kalashian overturned the agreement.\n\nTulare detectives began investigating the 42-year-old again in June, following a complaint made by the parent of a 16-year-old boy who believed she had purchased alcohol and drugs for his son, according to the Visalia Times Delta.\n\nShe will be sentenced on November 4 and could face four years behind bars and a lifetime sex offender registration.", "description": "Coral Lytle, 42, from Tulare, California, has pleaded guilty to having sex with two teenage boys aged 14 and 15, after seducing them in the fall of 2017 and driving them 15 miles for their illicit liaisons.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19449460-0-image-a-128_1570549327163.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
