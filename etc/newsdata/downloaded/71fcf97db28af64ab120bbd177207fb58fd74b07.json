For our prime minister to make the same acknowledgment, and act on it, would go a long way in addressing the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nThe RAF says the Voyager \u201ccan operate as a passenger aircraft in much the same way as a civilian airliner, but delivering personnel safely into theatre thanks to its defensive aids suite\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister was travelling between the two cities connected by the world\u2019s busiest intercontinental air route \u2013 linking New York JFK with London Heathrow.\n\nGoing east, the first departure is before 8am, the last at 11pm. In between, there are more than 20 flights each way on four different airlines \u2013 with dozens more options between other New York and London airports.\n\nNo 10 said that all seats on the Mr Johnson's flight were occupied in both directions, and that it is customary for prime ministers to use the jet for long-haul flights.\n\nOfficials say it is more efficient and cost effective than commercial aviation, and that the government makes a payment to offset all RAF prime ministerial flights.\n\nTheresa May chose the same mode of transport to travel to the UN General Assembly in 2018, at a cost to the taxpayer of \u00a3143,000.\n\nThe former prime minister\u2019s most expensive trip was to Buenos Aires for the G20 summit in November 2018, at a cost of almost half a million pounds.", "description": "The prime minister\u2019s decision to fly to and from New York on an RAF wide-bodied Airbus jet has been deplored by climate campaigners.
