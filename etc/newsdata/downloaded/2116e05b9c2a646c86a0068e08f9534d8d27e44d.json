An audience of tens of thousands, including the Prince of Wales, applauded as Newman\u2019s name was read out and the choir sang \u201cAlleluia.\u201d\n\nNewman, born in 1801, was a prominent Anglican at Oxford University, until 1845 when he converted to Anglicanism. His conversion caused a sensation; one of his sisters never spoke to him again.\n\nMonsignor Roderick Strange, a biographer of the saint told the Telegraph: \u201cAt that time Catholics were a despised minority. To go from a position of such distinction to become a catholic left many of his contemporaries asking \u2018what could you be thinking?!\u2019\u201d\n\nNewman became a priest and later Cardinal. As one of the great apologists for his faith, he helped found an oratory in England and what is today University College, Dublin. His writings are considered masterpieces of Victorian theology. He died in 1890 and his remains are in a sarcophagus in Birmingham. He is the first Englishman born since the 1600s to be canonised.", "description": "The Pope declared John Henry Newman a saint today, the first Briton to be canonised since 1976.", "authors": ["Tim Stanley", "Tom Welsh", "Julie Burchill", "Daniel Hannan", "Jacob Rees-Mogg"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000212886092-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
