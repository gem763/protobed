For years, employees have only needed to work 20 hours per week to qualify.\n\nIn an industry with a reputation for low pay and scant benefits, Whole Foods\u2019 change in policy will affect just under 2,000 people, or around 2% of its workforce. The company has around 95,000 employees.\n\nA Whole Foods spokeswoman noted that the company will provide employees \u201cresources to find alternative healthcare coverage options, or to explore full-time, healthcare-eligible positions,\u201d and stressed that all employees still receive a 20% discount on in-store purchases.\n\nBusiness Insider was first to report the change Thursday evening, which echoes one made by Trader Joe\u2019s in 2013. As a response to the Affordable Care Act, Trader Joe\u2019s told its employees they would need to work at least 30 hours per week to buy into the company health care plan, up from 18 hours per week.\n\nAmazon.com \u2015 which helped Bezos achieve the title of world\u2019s richest man \u2015 purchased Whole Foods in 2017 as it was struggling to compete with rivals in the organic foods market. Since then, the online retail giant has been able to multiply its grocery deliveries and give its Prime customers select Whole Foods discounts.\n\nWhile Whole Foods did not cite the rising cost of health care as a reason to drop medical coverage for some of its employees, other companies have reckoned with the price in recent years. In June, CNBC reported that Walgreens had cut a longtime health care benefit offered to retired employees, citing \u201crising and unpredictable healthcare costs.\u201d", "description": "Currently, employees qualify for its health plan by working at least 20 hours per week.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7bdc7e3b00002a74d28a37.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
