REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha\n\nSince demonstrations escalated in mid-June, Lee, 33, has been running what he has dubbed the National Calamity Hardware Store, selling protest essentials - hard hats, gas masks and goggles - near rally hot spots.\n\nPart-entrepreneur, part-activist, he has taken out short-term leases on storefronts in at least four districts, shifting to evade police and hostile landlords.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a business like this before. It\u2019s insane,\u201d Lee told Reuters in his latest shop in the gritty district of Cheung Sha Wan on the Kowloon peninsula.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government invoked colonial-era emergency laws last week, including a ban on face masks, which have been widely used by protesters to hide their identities. Lee dismissed any suggestion the regulation would hurt his business, saying more protesters had come to his stall.\n\n\u201cThe legislation of the anti-mask law only intensifies the social conflict,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the government can invoke emergency powers to pass certain laws or ordinances, they can use it to pass other unreasonable bills recklessly.\u201d\n\n\u2018HONG KONG HAS A FREE MARKET\u2019\n\nProtests against a now-withdrawn extradition law that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, have evolved into a broader fight for greater democracy, plunging Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis in decades.\n\nMost weekends, black-clad protesters throng the streets in demonstrations that have increasingly descended into violent clashes with police, who often fire tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds.\n\nProtective equipment has become harder to find, since the Chinese government restricted sales and exports of safety equipment into Hong Kong. This has made Lee even more determined to keep his business going.\n\n\u201cHong Kong has a free market. I am running the business without violating any law. We only announce our pop-up address one hour before we open the stall so it\u2019s almost impossible for the police to obtain a search warrant in time,\u201d he said.\n\nLee says his stall has been a constant target of the police and he has been arrested twice.\n\nPolice said in a statement to Reuters that a 33-year-old surnamed Lee, and five others, had been arrested on Sept. 30 on charges including possession of offensive weapons and inciting and taking part in unauthorized assemblies. They were released on bail.\n\nLee denies the charges.\n\nHe says it is a constant challenge to find new suppliers in Southeast Asia, Taiwan and the United States.\n\n\u2018FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM\u2019\n\nLee\u2019s political views go further than some other protesters opposed to what they see as the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and freedoms by China\u2019s Communist Party leaders. He openly backs independence for the territory, a taboo topic for Beijing.\n\n\u201cIndependence can\u2019t be finished within our generation. It will take a few generations,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Lee no longer protests on the front lines, he is sympathetic to the young activists and often offers discounts to hard-up customers.\n\n\u201cIf we want to rebel against the authoritarian regime, we should do it without thinking about the price. At most, I will apply for bankruptcy. If we lose this fight, we will lose a few generations\u2019 freedom,\u201d he said.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nLee says his work keeps him busy at all hours and he snatches a few hours of sleep when he can.\n\n\u201cThe only regret I have is that I don\u2019t have time to spend with my seven-year-old daughter and five-year-old son,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI hope they will understand one day that I\u2019m fighting for their freedom.\u201d", "description": "While months of anti-government protests have taken a toll on Hong Kong businesses, from luxury retailers to hotels and restaurants, Keita Lee's pop-up stall is thriving.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439540273&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A087", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
