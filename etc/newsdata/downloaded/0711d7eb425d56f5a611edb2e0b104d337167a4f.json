Now photos show the scale of the filthy conditions she was left in\n\nA reclusive pensioner, whose dying wife was found sitting covered in maggots and surrounded by bags of stinking rubbish, was today jailed for eight years.\n\n'Selfish' Richard Wallach claimed that he had not known his 61-year-old wife Valerie had various agonising deep pressure sores and injuries and 'assumed she was alright'.\n\nBut a court heard that she had been left sitting helplessly in a leather chair soiled with urine and faeces in the bay window of their home for weeks or months and he had simply ignored it.\n\nAfter her plight was finally discovered the odour in the house was described as 'horrendous' by paramedics and fire fighters who had to fight their way through layers of rotting rubbish.\n\nAnd she was found to be in a 'shocking' condition with her skin grey apparently rotting with maggots stuck to her wounds.\n\nJudge Neil Flewitt, QC, told the 67-year-old hoarder that it was clear from the evidence, 'that you are self-obsessed, by which I mean you are excessively preoccupied with your own life and circumstances and think only about yourself'.\n\nHe said a probation officer concluded he had a tendency to view things from the perspective of his own perceived needs and health issues at the expense of his wife's needs and deteriorating health issues.\n\n'In other words you are a thoroughly selfish man and in this instance your selfishness led directly to the death of your wife.'\n\nA jury at Liverpool Crown Court took just under three hours last month to unanimously find him guilty of gross neglect manslaughter.\n\nFilthy living room: The 67-year-old failed to look after his wife before she was finally admitted to hospital riddled with skin ulcers and infested with flies and maggots in August 2017\n\nMum-of-two Valerie, who had a history of osteoporosis-arthritis, obesity, agrophobia and depression, was rescued after Wallach finally went to the nearby Elms medical centre in August 2017 saying she was 'babbling'\n\nJudge Flewitt told Wallach, who listened through a hearing loop but showed no reaction, that his breach of duty to his wife was 'truly exceptionally bad and so reprehensible as to justify the conclusion that it amounted to gross negligence.\n\n'Your neglect of your wife was extreme and led to her living the last few months of her life in appalling conditions.'\n\nHe pointed out that apart from a hoarding disorder the defendant has no other mental problems and he kept the rooms he used relatively clean and tidy.\n\n'That leads me to the inescapable conclusion that you simply couldn't be bothered to take the same care of your wife as you took of yourself,' he added\n\nThe judge added that he was sure the victim had been seriously ill and in severe pain for several weeks if not months and Wallach was aware of it 'and simply ignored it.'\n\nThe mum-of-two, who had a history of osteoporosis-arthritis, obesity, agrophobia and depression, was rescued after Wallach finally went to the nearby Elms medical centre in August 2017 saying she was 'babbling'.\n\nParamedics who went to the address noted the foul smell and build-up of rubbish inside, and decided to wear protective clothing while entering. The toilet was overflowing and tissue strewn across the floor\n\nCoins, cigarette rolling papers and a filters were found on a bedside table among rubbish\n\nShocked paramedics and firefighters had to fight their way through mountains of bags of rubbish, rotting food and faeces, to reach her. Fire fighters said 'they had never seen a living human-being in such a poor condition,' said Richard Pratt, QC, prosecuting.\n\nShe showed no response until fire fighters managed to get her out of the chair when she screamed and it was found skin, blood and bodily fluids had been left behind.\n\nWhen bags covering her legs were moved they were found to be sore, swollen and covered in a thick brown slime.\n\nIt had been suggested that the window might have to be removed to get her out of the house and Wallach objected as they were new and said there could be insurance implications.\n\nIt took staff at the Royal Liverpool Hospital 90 minutes to clean Mrs Wallach and her blackened teeth were so decayed that she was unable to speak and screamed in pain when staff tried to clean her mouth.\n\nA number of framed photographs can also be seen sitting on shelves but the images are barely visible through the grime in the dark room. The floor is littered with rubbish and broken chairs\n\nThis disgusting hallway of the Toxteth, Liverpool home which the pair had lived in since 2003\n\nHer shabby dirty clothing only covered her top half and was described as being in an 'appalling' state with her legs and body covered in faeces and she even had a Pot Noodle sachet stuck to her leg. 'The smell coming from her was overpowering.'\n\nWhen a doctor told her husband that her prognosis was poor and she was likely to die that day, Wallach responded by saying, 'Thanks for letting me know but who is going to sort out my problem, I have been constipated for weeks.'\n\nHer legs were severely ulcerated and she had the most serious type of ulcers on her buttocks, backs of her thighs and both heels which had taken weeks or months to have reached that level. They were extremely painful as well as foul smelling and she was found to have overwhelming sepsis.\n\nShe died 19 days later on September 12, 2017 from multiple organ failure and advanced breast cancer, which had spread to her brain, spine and ribs - but was only diagnosed on her admission to hospital.\n\nWallach, who still lives in their mid-terraced home in Gwendoline Street, Toxteth, denied manslaughter. He had been receiving a carer's allowance because of her infirmity but payments had stopped about six weeks before her death.\n\nWallach, who still lives in their mid-terraced home in Gwendoline Street, Toxteth, denied manslaughter. He had been receiving a carer's allowance because of her infirmity but payments had stopped about six weeks before her death\n\nThe defendant was shown photographs of his wife in hospital and admitted the injuries were 'very bad'.\n\n'I must have had a mental lapse or something. I do not recall those injuries at all,' he said.\n\n'I looked after her to the best of my ability' and added, 'I assumed she was all right. If she had been in pain she would have let me know and I would have done something about it'.\n\nKenneth Grant, defending, said today that Wallach spent his childhood in care, and after marrying his wife they lived 'an unusual life style, perhaps melancholy and socially isolated.'\n\nThey had few if any friends, no family support network and no contact with their neighbours.\n\n'He is a senior citizen who lived a quiet, unassuming, uneventful, blameless life. He is now held criminally responsible for the death of his wife. If ever there was a sad, deeply depressing case this surely is it.\n\n'Valerie Wallach did not deserve to die in hospital. She did not deserve to die having succumbed to her injuries in the way the jury found he permitted,' said Mr Grant.", "description": "Richard Wallach, 67, was jailed for eight years at Liverpool Crown Court for neglecting is sick wife Valerie, who was found covered in faeces and maggots in their Toxteth home.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/18/19551250-0-image-a-22_1570728242302.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
