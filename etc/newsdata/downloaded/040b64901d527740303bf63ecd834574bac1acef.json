The network has since updated a version of the video hosted on the NBC News website and issued a correction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for it and it\u2019s my responsibility to check any graphic that I go on-air with, so I apologize for this screw-up,\u201d tweeted Steve Kornacki, an NBC News personality who appeared in the segment. \u201cI owe viewers, candidates and their supporters information that is 100% reliable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks Steve - appreciate your professionalism and responsiveness,\u201d replied Mr. Yang. \u201cThese things happen.\u201d\n\nMr. Yang, a 44-year-old tech entrepreneur, qualified to compete in next Thursday\u2019s primary debate by securing donations from 130,000 unique contributors and polling at or above 2% in four different polls approved by the Democratic National Committee.\n\nPolling released last Wednesday by Quinnipiac University found that 3% of Democratic voters recently surveyed said Mr. Yang was their candidate of choice, effectively ranking him in sixth place behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont independent, Sen. Kamala Harris, California Democrat, and Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\n\nCNN subsequently reported on the Quinnipiac survey last week by airing an image that listed six top Democratic candidates but did not include Mr. Yang. The image listed the top five ranking candidates, per Quinnipiac, and Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman from Texas who received only 1% in the same poll.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve never been a politician before, but the treatment of our rising national poll results has been odd and confusing,\u201d Mr. Yang said at the time.\n\nRandy Jones, Mr. Yang\u2019s campaign spokesman, later said CNN apologized and promised it would no longer use the image, Business Insider reported.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
