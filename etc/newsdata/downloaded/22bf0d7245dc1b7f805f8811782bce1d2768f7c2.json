I know it\u2019s not the easiest for me because we are travelling around the world and racing Formula One cars, our carbon footprint is higher than the average homeowner who lives in the same city.\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you should be afraid to speak out about things. I\u2019m always looking at things and how I can improve the effect that I\u2019m having on the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something over time I have become more aware of and it takes a while. It\u2019s not a quick fix. It takes time to understand the implications and I think it just about education.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to highlight areas, whether people choose to look into those is up to them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d feel like I wasn\u2019t doing anything positive if I didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt was a defiant response from Hamilton, who switched to a plant-based diet in 2017 and in September he helped launch a vegan burger restaurant in London.\n\nAnd his current rivals rallied behind him, with Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel admitting that F1 should be more environmentally friendly.\n\nThe four-time world champion said: \"I don't follow Lewis on Instagram because I'm not active on social media, but I think the point is very clear. We would be ignorant not to deal with this situation.\n\n\"For our part it is difficult to be accepted from the outside, because we travel and the races are all over the world. In general, Formula One needs to do more, we have a worldwide distribution, we must send a positive message.\n\n\"I personally believe that anyone can contribute minimally, and the difference would be enormous. It is inevitable that change will come and we hope it will happen as soon as possible.\"\n\nHamilton will secure a sixth world title on Sunday if he out-scores team-mate Valtteri Bottas by at least 14 points.", "description": "The Formula 1 world champion's recent declarations about climate change and the environment have seen him come in for criticism", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20717717.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_F1-Grand-Prix-of-Mexico-Previews.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
