Our planet consumed a staggering 26,700 TWh of electricity in 2018, with China gobbling up the lion\u2019s share at 6,167 TWh, while the United States was the second largest consumer at 3,971TWh, and India third at 1,243TWh.\n\nCoal supplied the biggest chunk of our electricity at 38 percent, while gas and hydro were second and third at 23 percent and 19 percent, respectively.\n\nOnly 3 percent of our electricity came from oil.\n\nThe percentage of electricity generation from oil has been in constant decline since 1973 when it stood at an all-time high of 22 percent. All other forms of power generation, including renewables, coal, gas and nuclear recorded growth with oil being the only decliner.\n\nElectricity mix More\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nSource: IEA\n\nElectricity generation More\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nIt\u2019s not by coincidence that heightened electricity consumption has come at a time when the internet is growing at an unprecedented rate.\n\nStory continues", "description": "As public perception continues to focus on climate change, there is one industry gobbling up an incredible amount of dirty energy", "authors": ["Alex Kimani"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a0i5EbjJgslBbl6AGgyo5Q--~B/aD0zMzY7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/oilprice.com/738be4175c7c1d3956ce0326f338afda", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
