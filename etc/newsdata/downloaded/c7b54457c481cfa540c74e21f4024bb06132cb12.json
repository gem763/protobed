At the end of the first half he transmitted his anger to us,\u201d Bologna forward Rodrigo Palacio said. \u201cIn the second half we came out with the necessary desire and a great mentality.\u201d\n\nWhen Bologna arrived back home hours after the match, the team bus stopped at the Sant\u2019Orsola hospital where Mihajlovic is being treated and the players chanted their coach\u2019s name until he popped his head outside his window and waved to them.\n\nBrescia led 3-1 at the break with a brace from Alfredo Donnarumma but Daniela Dessena was sent off after a dive early in the second half. Palacio then started the comeback, which was followed by an own-goal from Brescia\u2019s Stefano Sabelli and the winner from Riccardo Orsolini.\n\nMattia Bani scored Bologna\u2019s opening goal and Andrea Cistana scored Brescia\u2019s third.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time Bologna has gained seven points from its opening three matches in 17 years.\n\nBologna is two points behind perfect Inter Milan and ahead of eight-time defending champion Juventus on goals scored (six to five).\n\nTorino can extend its perfect start against promoted Lecce on Monday.\n\nIn the previous round, Bologna beat Spal 1-0 with an injury-time goal from Roberto Soriano.\n\nMihajlovic surprised his squad by traveling with his hospital band still on to the season-opener at Hellas Verona, which ended 1-1.\n\nMihajlovic was rehired by Bologna in January to replace Filippo Inzaghi and engineered a complete turnaround for a team that was fighting off relegation, leading the club to a 10th place finish.\n\nWhen Mihajlovic announced in July that he had an acute form of leukemia, the club said it would still keep him in charge.\n\nBrescia is still without Mario Balotelli, who is serving a four-match ban from last season in the French league.\n\nROMA ROMPS\n\nRoma earned its first win under new coach Paulo Fonseca with a four-goal outburst in the first half of a 4-2 victory over Sassuolo.\n\nBryan Cristante, Edin Dzeko, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Justin Kluivert each scored before halftime with a trio of assists from Lorenzo Pellegrini.\n\nDomenico Berardi then pulled two back for Sassuolo after the break.\n\nMkhitaryan scored on debut after being loaned from Arsenal with his first shot on goal, an accurate angled drive.\n\nAC MILAN STRUGGLES\n\nAC Milan required a second-half penalty from Krzysztof Piatek to overcome 10-man Hellas Verona 1-0.\n\nThe Rossoneri produced only one shot on goal in the first half despite a straight red card to Verona\u2019s Mariusz Stepinski in the 21st.\n\nMilan earned a penalty midway through the second half when Koray Gunter blocked a shot from Hakan Calhanoglu with his arm.\n\nEarlier, Milan fullback Davide Calabria hit the post.\n\nPiatek had a potential second goal disallowed by VAR for a foul on the goalkeeper.\n\nCalabria was sent off for clotheslining a defender in the last minute of stoppage time, setting up a dangerous free kick from Verona but Miguel Veloso\u2019s effort hit Milan\u2019s wall and Darko Lazovic\u2019s powerful attempt at the rebound went just wide.\n\nOTHER RESULTS\n\nAtalanta warmed up for its Champions League debut with a last-ditch 2-1 win at Genoa courtesy of Duvan Zapata\u2019s strike five minutes into stoppage time. Having finished a club-record third last season, Atalanta opens the elite European competition at Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday.\n\nAn injury-time winner from Jasmin Kurtic helped Spal to a come-from-behind 2-1 win over visiting Lazio.\n\nAlso, defender Luca Ceppitelli scored twice for Cagliari in a 3-1 victory at Parma.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/AndrewDampf\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sinisa Mihajlovic's fight against leukemia continues to inspire Bologna, which has surprisingly surged into second place three rounds into Serie A.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Dampf"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/italy_soccer_serie_a_29295_c0-16-2868-1688_s1770x1032.jpg?ea8622628ea4286509758714367fcab42014d088", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
