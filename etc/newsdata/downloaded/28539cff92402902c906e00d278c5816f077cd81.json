Born in 1666 in Lechbruck in Bavaria, David Tecchler was one of the finest German luthier's of the 17th Century. Little is known about his life, except that he travelled to Rome in his 20s where he began crafting string instruments. In the late 17th Century, demand for string instruments was soaring. Although his cellos and double basses were most sought, his violin's are also prized.
