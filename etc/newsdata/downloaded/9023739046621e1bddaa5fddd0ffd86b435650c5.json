Maybe it goes right up to President Obama. I happen to think it does,' he said during a press conference at the White House.\n\n'It was a corrupt election,' he said of the 2016 contest, which he won.\n\nThe president seemed to suggest it could have been a government wide conspiracy as he threw out the names of former FBI director James Comey, former CIA director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper as people who should be investigated.\n\nPresident Donald Trump accused Barack Obama of interfering in the 2016 election\n\nHe also suggested his Republican ally on Capitol Hill, Senator Lindsey Graham, should stop criticizing his policy on Syria and start investigating what happened three years ago.\n\nAnd he even suggested a list of people for Graham - the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee - to call on, including Comey, former FBI assistant director Andrew McCabe, former bureau staff Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and Brennan.\n\n'I think Lindsey should focus on Judiciary. He ought to find out about what happened with Comey, what happened with McCabe, Lisa, what happened with Peter Strzok, what happened with President Obama, what happened with Brennan,' Trump said.\n\nTrump's focus was on his past election Wednesday as the impeachment probe into his presidency heats up on Capitol Hill ahead of his 2020 re-election bid.\n\nTrump turned on his Oval Office predecessor as he demanded to see the Democrats' hacked email server and claimed Rudy Giuliani was investigating corruption in the 2016 race in his dealings with the Ukraine.\n\nThe president offered a lengthy defense of his personal attorney during an Oval Office sit down with Italian President Sergio Mattarella and brought up a long litany of past complaints about the 2016 presidential election along with his new charge that Obama could be to blame.\n\n'Whether it's President Obama, himself, let's see whether or not it's President Obama,' Trump said in reference to a Justice Department investigation on the last presidential contest.\n\nDonald Trump railed about the 2016 election during an Oval Office meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella\n\nTrump has complained of work against him in the 2016 election and, on Wednesday, he suggested Barack Obama was behind it\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained there was corruption in the 2016 election that nearly kept him from winning the Oval Office but has presented no evidence to back up his complaint.\n\n'There was tremendous corruption,' he argued Wednesday of the 2016 election.\n\nAnd Giuliani has backed his belief.\n\n'When he saw what was going on with our election of 2016, the election I won, but the election that was absolutely corrupted by things that took place in government,' Trump said of Giuliani.\n\nThe president offered a long list of figures he accused of working against him in 2016 - including former FBI director James Comey, former FBI assistant director Andrew McCabe, and former bureau staff Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.\n\nHe threw in the former president's name at the end.\n\nComey was FBI director when the bureau opened a counter intelligence investigation into Trump's 2016 campaign, McCabe was acting FBI director when the special counsel was appointed and Strzok and Page were two FBI staffers working on the investigations while having an extramarital affair and exchanging texts about how they did not want to see Trump win the presidency.\n\n'The IG report is going to come out soon. We'll see what happens,' Trump said. 'I know nothing about it in terms of the report. I'm waiting for the report like everybody else, but I predict you will see things that you don't even believe the level of corruption.'\n\nTrump seemed to be referring to Attorney General William Barr's investigation into the origins of the Russia probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe Department of Justice's inspector general is expected to release its findings on the matter shortly although no exact time frame has been given.\n\nBarr is said to be closely supervising the probe.\n\nTrump said Giuliani is helping with that investigation.\n\nThe president told Ukrainian President Zelensky during their July 25 phone call that the former New York City mayor is someone who 'very much knows what's happening.'\n\n'Rudy was seeking after corruption. I think there is nothing wrong with seeking out corruption,' Trump said Wednesday of Giuliani's work in the Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani's role in U.S. and Ukraine relations has come under question given he has no official government role but he has pushed an unproven conspiracy theory that the Ukrainians were behind the email hacks in the 2016 election and made it appear as it was the Russians who did it.\n\nThe former mayor also worked to extract information from the Ukraine that could harm Democrats.\n\nThe authority Trump gave him over Ukraine policy is under question.\n\nPresident Trump also defended Rudy Giuliani's work in the Ukraine\n\nPresident Trump also complained he wanted to see the Democrats' hacked email server\n\nThen-National Security Adviser John Bolton reportedly called Giuliani 'a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.'\n\nAnd U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is expected to testify Thursday that Trump gave Giuliani the authority to approve a presidential meeting with the president of the Ukraine.\n\nOn Wednesday, as his rant on the 2016 election wrapped up, the president turned his attention to the Democratic National Committee's email server.\n\nThe DNC was hacked by Russian operatives during the 2016 election. The emails released embarrassed the party and resulted in then-DNC chief Debbie Wasserman Schultz's resignation.\n\n'I still ask the FBI, where is the server? How come the FBI never got the server from the DNC? Where is the server? I want to see the server. Let's see what's on the server. So the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine. I'd like to see the server. I think it's very important for this country to see the server! Nobody wants to see it. The media never wants to see it. But I tell you, Republicans want to see it,' Trump complained.\n\nThe DNC hired cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike in June 2016 to investigate a breach into its server that CrowdStrike determined to be have been done by two Russian hacker groups.\n\nThe servers were never physically examined by the FIB but CrowdStrike, whose staff includes a former senior FBI official, gave forensic evidence to the bureau.\n\nThe co-founder of CrowdStrike is a Russian-born U.S. citizen who has no known ties to the Ukraine.\n\nTrump, in his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, mentioned the company as he pushed his counter part to launch an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden and into this unproven theory that Ukraine has ties to 2016 election interference.\n\n'I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike,' Trump told Zelensky. 'The server, they say Ukraine has it.'\n\nTrump brought up unproven theories on the 2016 election during his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - the two men are seen together in September in New York during UN General Assembly week\n\nAttorney General William Barr has been overseeing a probe of how the Russian investigation started and results are expected to be released soon\n\nTrump has referenced this unfounded conspiracy theory that Ukrainians, not Russians, were behind the DNC hack and the Ukrainians made it appear the Russian government worked with Trump\u2019s presidential campaign on it.\n\nHe appeared to suggest on the call that CrowdStrike helped the Ukraine with a coverup.\n\nGiuliani is among those pushing this theory.", "description": "Donald Trump accused Barack Obama\u00a0of interfering in the 2016 election.
