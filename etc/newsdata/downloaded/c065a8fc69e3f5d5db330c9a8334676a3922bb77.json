Ten passengers and three crew members boarded, and the B-17G bomber pulled away. Debra took video of the plane on the tarmac and gave a thumbs up.\n\nJust five minutes later, she got a text message from Riddell that the pilot had told them to strap into their seats because they were headed back to the airport.\n\nWhen she asked why, he replied with one word: 'Turbulence.'\n\nWhat neither of them knew is that the pilot had radioed to Air Traffic Control to say that engine number four - the far engine on the right wing - was out and they needed to head back.\n\nBut within seconds, the plane crashed into a radio tower near the the runway and then skidded into a de-icing facility nearby.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\n\nRobert Riddell, 59, was not supposed to on Wednesday's flight but the company called and asked if he could switch from his originally scheduled Thursday. His wife, Debra, traveled with him that morning and he texted from the plane that one of the engines was not working and: 'This does not bode well'.

They were also planning a trip to Normandy, France, to celebrate both of their 60th birthdays.\n\nMoments before the crash, Riddell shared this photograph from inside the B-17G Flying Fortress plane while it was taxiing\n\n'We were meant to be together, but apparently not forever,' she said.\n\nRiddell was an aviation enthusiast who excitedly shared pictures from inside the plane before it took off and on the tarmac.\n\nDebra wrote in a post on Facebook: 'It's been a long and tragic day. Words cannot express how devastated I am.\n\n'At this point, all survivors have been identified.\n\n'Rob was not one of therm. Rob was the best person I've ever known.\n\n'He was my soul mate, I will miss him beyond words can ever express. He loved his children more than anyone cold know.\n\n'He was brilliant, loving, funny, reliable, compassionate and the best man I've ever known.\n\n'The world lost an amazing person today,' she said.\n\nShe added that he had embraced her children from a previous relationship and that he was loving towards her grandchildren.\n\nThe World War II-era plane killed seven, including Riddell, and injured nine others.\n\nInvestigators say one of the plane's engines failed when it crashed into the a radio tower near the the runway and careened into a de-icing facility nearby.\n\nBoth pilots, 75-year-old Ernest McCauley and 71-year-old Michael Foster, were killed. The passengers aside from Riddell who died include: David Broderick, 56; Gary Mazzone, 66; James Roberts, 48; and Robert Rubner, 64.\n\nFlight engineer Mitchel Melton, 34, was injured along with four passengers: Andy Barrett, 36; Joseph Huber, 48; Linda Schmidt, 62; and Tom Schmidt, 62.\n\nRiddell (pictured), one of the victims, was an aviation enthusiast.

The aircraft was taking 10 passengers on a one-hour tourist flight when a problem with its engine sent it plummeting\n\nThis was what remained of the plane on Thursday, a day after the crash, once the fire had been put out and the victims had been recovered from it\n\nThe carcass of the plane remains at the airport and the NTSB is investigating the crash. Only the tail and wings remained in tact\n\nA close-up of the plane after it crashed into the de-icing facility after trying to make an emergency landing on Wednesday\n\n13 people were on board the plane when it crashed. Seven died and six were able to escape the fiery wreckage. Many remain in hospital\n\nThe plane crashed into the de-icing facility at 9.53am, just eight minutes after it took off for an hour-long tour\n\nHERO NATIONAL GUARDSMAN OPENED HATCH WITH FLAME RESISTANT GLOVES AND PULLED SURVIVORS TO SAFETY Chief Master Sgt. James M. Traficante. was a paying customer on the tourist flight on Wednesday. Fortunately, he had brought with him his Air Force issued flame retardant gloves and has training in air craft emergencies. He was sitting near the back of the aircraft. After it slammed into the de-icing facility, he was able to open the hatch and get the other passengers out of the burning aircraft. Chief Traficante began his military service on active duty as an Airlift/Bombardment Aircraft Maintenance Specialist (Crew Chief) in 1984. Upon completion of his active duty tour, he joined the Rhode Island Air National Guard where he served as a crew chief, flight engineer, and loadmaster when the unit transitioned to C-130J`s. 'The Connecticut National Guard is thankful that our Airman on board the aircraft is safe and I ask that you respect his and his family's privacy as he recovers. 'When tragedy hit, his training kicked in,' Maj. Gen. Francis Evon, The Adjutant General of the Connecticut National Guard said.\n\nOne of the injured passengers, 54-year-old James Traficante, 54, is a National Guard command chief who pulled some of the survivors to safety after the plane caught fire was also injured.\n\nA problem with one of its four engines caused the pilot to turn back five minutes into the flight and upon impact on the runway, the aircraft hit the instrument landing system which beams a signal to the plane from the tarmac to help it land.\n\nThe aircraft careered off it and the plane veered off to the right and into the de-icing facility, sparking a huge fire which engulfed the aircraft and filled the building.\n\nRiddell was a business analyst for a Connecticut insurance company and had two adult children from a previous relationship. He excitedly shared photos from inside the aircraft and before he boarded on Facebook moments before his death.\n\nThe plane was one of only 10 in the world that are still flying.\n\nTraficante, brought flame retardant flight gloves with him, which allowed him to open the hatch.\n\nThe National Guard said he has experience and training in handling emergencies on aircraft.\n\nTraficante suffered injuries and was transported to Hartford Hospital for treatment.\n\nHe was released on Wednesday evening and is currently recovering at home.\n\nMelton, another injured passenger, suffered a broken ribs and had to have surgery to repair a bleed in his liver but is expected to survive.\n\nThe B-17G was being operated by The Collings Foundation as a tour plane.\n\nTickets on the excursion cost up to around $500 and the cost is considered a 'donation' to the charity which restores the aircraft.\n\nThe plane was supposed to take off around 8.30am, but problems were reported with the engine.\n\nAt 9.45am, the plane took off.\n\nFive minutes later, at 9.50am, the pilot radioed to say there was a problem with one of its four engines.\n\n'N93012 would like to return to the field.'\n\nThe controller then asks: 'What's the reason for coming back?'\n\nRiddell also shared photographs from the tarmac before boarding the plane. The B-17G which he flew on appears to be behind this aircraft. He captioned it: 'In the waiting area\n\nRiddell, 59, is pictured with his wife Debra on their 2015 wedding day\n\nB-17G 'Nine-O-Nine' crashed and burst into flames at Connecticut's Bradley International Airport on Wednesday morning\n\nB-17G Flying Fortress, 'Nine-O-Nine', had survived a 1987 crash The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress Nine-O-Nine plane involved in Wednesday's tragedy had survived a previous crash in the 1987, a year after being bought by The Collings Foundation. That incident happened at an air show in Pittsburgh and several people were injured. Memphis Belle is the most famous of the B17 bombers and its last mission was portrayed in the 1990s film of the same name It was the result of the plane being hit by a severe crosswind as it touched down which caused it to overshoot the runway and plunge down a hill. It is unclear if the people injured in that accident were on-board the plane or on the ground. It was rebuilt and then used to perform 1,200 'tour duties' where people were able to view the bomber. B-17s were most commonly used in daytime raids over Germany in WWII as well as causing havoc on enemy shipping in the Pacific. The B-17 - dubbed 'Nine-O-Nine' - in the Bradley Airport crash was built in Long Beach in 1945 and was too late for combat. It served as part of the Air/Sea 1st Rescue Squadron and later in the Military Air Transport Service. In 1952, it was subjected to three different nuclear explosions in 1952 and after a cool-down period of 13 years, was sold as part of an 800-ton scrap pile, and was restored by the aircraft Specialties Company. It was then used as a fire bomber, dropping water and borate on forest fires. The most popular of the B-17 bombers, the famed B-17F Memphis Belle, was the first heavy bomber to return to the US after flying 25 missions over Europe.\n\n'You got number four engine. We'd like to return and blow it out,' another pilot answered.\n\nUpon landing, NTSB officials say the instrument landing system 'stanchions' were 'impacted'.\n\nThe stanchions are a metal frame which surround the tower that transmits a signal to the plane and guides its landing.\n\nWhen the plane crashed into it, it veered off to the right and off the runway, across a grassy area and into the de-icing building where the entire wreckage caught fire.\n\nExperts say the cause of the crash is likely to do with the landing.\n\n'Something went wrong on the final approach. That's what they will be investigating,' Arizona pilot Joseph Buckley, a B-17 expert, told The Connecticut Post.\n\nThe Collings Foundation said in a statement on Wednesday: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were on that flight and we will be forever grateful to the heroic efforts of the first responders at Bradley.'\n\nThe B-17 Flying Fortress was developed as a four-engine bomber plane during the 1930s and was used as a strategic bomber plane during World War II.\n\nIt was designed for high altitude flight, speed, and heavy defensive armament in order to survive enemy defenses. It could fly up to 30,000 feet with combat load, while powered turrets and flexible guns covered all areas around the aircraft.\n\nIts most significant service was over Germany, and it helped win the war by crippling Nazi war forces.\n\nThe most popular of the planes, the famed B-17F Memphis Belle, was the first heavy bomber to return to the US after flying 25 missions over Europe.\n\nThe Memphis Belle became one of the most iconic symbols of WWII and was portrayed in the 1990s film of the same name, which is a fictionalized account of its last mission in 1943.\n\nThe B-17G - dubbed 'Nine-O-Nine' was built at Long Beach in 1945, and although it was too late for WWII combat, it served as part of the Air/Sea 1st Rescue Squadron and later in the Military Air Transport Service.\n\nIt was subjected to the effects of three different nuclear explosions in 1952 and after a cool-down period of 13 years, was sold as part of an 800-ton scrap pile, and was restored by the Aircraft Specialties Company. It was later used as a fire bomber, dropping water and borate on forest fires for 20 years.\n\nIt was sold in January 1986 to the Collings Foundation, and was named 'Nine-O-Nine' in honor of a 91st Bomb Group, 323rd Squadron plane of the same name which completed 140 missions without an abort or loss of a crewman.\n\nThis particular plane had survived a crash in 1987 - damaging the nose, and the engines and propellers were torn from their mounts.\n\nIt was repaired, and flew more than 1,200 'tour stops' where people were able to view the plane.", "description": "Moments before the plane crashed on Wednesday, one of the passengers, Robert Riddell, 59, texted his wife, Debra, that they were heading back to the airport because of 'turbulence'.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos", "Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/14/19297750-0-image-a-21_1570195583151.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
