Her mission was to disrupt a space that historically lacked representation, and to celebrate confidence and inclusivity for all shapes and shades.\n\nThe brand\u2019s everyday undergarments and sexy lingerie are now included in Amazon\u2019s free two-day shipping for Prime members, a much better shipping deal than Savage x Fenty\u2019s own policy (it starts at $5 for nonmembers).\n\nBut the news doesn\u2019t stop there. Prime members will be able to watch the Savage x Fenty New York Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2019 fashion show via Amazon Video on Sept. 20. The show, which was filmed Tuesday, includes an all-star lineup of performances from artists like Halsey, Migos and DJ Khaled, as well as models, actors and dancers such as Laverne Cox, Normani and 21 Savage wearing the latest styles from the brand.\n\nBen Gabbe via Getty Images Rihanna performs onstage during Savage X Fenty show on Tuesday in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nLast year\u2019s fall/winter show was hailed for being an immersive experience and celebration of diversity, as it featured not only top models like the Hadid sisters but also plus-size models, women of color and pregnant women in maternity lingerie.\n\nThis year\u2019s Savage x Fenty show is also coming on the heels of Victoria\u2019s Secret announcing it had canceled its famous annual fashion show after years of dwindling viewership and increased criticism of the brand\u2019s lack of representation and inclusivity. (Who can forget when singer Halsey \u2015 who, in a final act of shade, will be performing at this year\u2019s Savage x Fenty show \u2015 called out Edward Razek, Victoria\u2019s Secret chief marketing officer at the time, for his LGBTQ-insensitive remarks after she performed at the show last year?)\n\nCould the Savage x Fenty show be the new Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show? We sure hope so. In the meantime, we\u2019ll be shopping all the latest Savage x Fenty on Amazon.\n\nTake a look below at our favorite Savage x Fenty styles on Amazon:\n\nLike what you see?
