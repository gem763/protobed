According to UBS, Commonwealth Bank was the only big bank to increase its mortgage book in August, while the three second-tier banks reported mortgage book growth of 3.5 per cent, 1.5 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively.\n\nBendigo and Adelaide Bank also cut its rates by 15 basis points, after shedding 20 basis points in June and July. It also lowered rates on its variable business loans by 0.20 per cent.\n\n\u2018\u2018These rate changes carefully consider the diverse interests of all stakeholders, the performance of our business, our market competitiveness and our deep connection with, and responsibility to, communities right across our national network,\u2019\u2019 said Bendigo Bank managing director Marnie Baker.\n\nBank of Queensland is cutting standard and variable principal and interest rates by just 10 basis points, with a 25 basis point cut for owner-occupier and investor interest-only loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data from comparison site Mozo, just four companies passed on the recommended 25 basis point cut in full: fintech lenders Homestar, Freedom Lend, Athena and NAB-owned Ubank.\n\nCompressed profit margins owing to funding cost pressures in a low rate environment are widely cited as a factor in the banks not honouring the federal government or central bank\u2019s wishes by passing on the cut in full.\n\nThe advantage of no deposits\n\nHowever, JP Morgan analyst Andrew Triggs said that because many of these online lenders were not authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs), they were not subject to the same profit constraints or reliance on deposits as a cheap source of funding.\n\n\"Non-banks, who are not able to take deposits, do not face [this] issue of margin impact from the inability to reprice certain deposits lower,\" Mr Triggs said.\n\n\"It should not be a surprise, therefore, that some of the non-banks that we track [for example, Athena] have passed on the rate cut in full.\n\n\"We also believe that new entrants such as Athena are likely to prioritise loan growth over margins at this point. If the cash rate falls further, as the market is pricing, we expect this will help to reinforce market share loss by the major banks over the coming years.\"\n\nBrett Le Mesurier of Shaw & Partners agreed that some of the second-tier banks, particularly Macquarie, HSBC and ING, had been successful in grabbing some market share, but said banks outside the big four were facing the same profit pressures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe gain in market share is not as significant as the potential damage to profit from having reducing margins, which may have happened if they passed on more,\" he said.\n\nTriggs said that because many of these online lenders were not authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs), they were not subject to the same profit constraints or reliance on deposits as a cheap source of funding.\n\n\u2018\u2018Non-banks, which are not able to take deposits, do not face [this] issue of margin impact from the inability to reprice certain deposits lower,\" he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018It should not be a surprise, therefore, that some of the non-banks that we track [for example, Athena] have passed on the rate cut in full.\n\n\u2018\u2018We also believe that new entrants such as Athena are likely to prioritise loan growth over margins at this point.
