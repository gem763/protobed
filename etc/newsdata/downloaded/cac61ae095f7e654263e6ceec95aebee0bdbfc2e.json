Johnson is required by law to seek a new extension to the Brexit process if the U.K. and EU cannot reach a deal by Oct. 19, but he has maintained that he will take the U.K. out of the EU \"do or die\" at the end of October, according to CNN.\n\nGo deeper: Everything you need to know about Brexit", "description": "\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/SX-cw9fjAQH-c1a0SvVjEkWtT3M=/0x0:3252x1829/1920x1080/2019/10/08/1570535095874.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
