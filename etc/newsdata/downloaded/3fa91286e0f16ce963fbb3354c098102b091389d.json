(John Raoux/AP)\n\nHistorians recently rated Barack Obama as the 12th best president in the nation\u2019s history. On foreign policy, they lauded his pragmatism, multilateralism and internationalism. These traits all contrast favorably with his predecessor\u2019s preference for unilateralism and \u201ccowboy diplomacy\u201d and his successor\u2019s scorn for Washington\u2019s traditional Western allies and for multilateral organizations such as NATO.\n\nBut not everyone agrees. In the first comprehensive and critical analysis of Obama\u2019s foreign policy, historian Jeremy Kuzmarov highlights Obama\u2019s mistakes and reckless policies with consequences around the globe, especially the tensions with China and Russia that continue to escalate today. The book also advances a Leftist critique that is at odds with how mainstream historians view Obama.\n\nLike much of his previous scholarship, Kuzmarov brings a revisionist sensibility \u2014 like historians such as William Appleman Williams, who blamed Washington for the outbreak of the Cold War \u2014 to investigating the 44th president. He does not aim to offer \u201cimpartial\u201d or \u201cbalanced\u201d history; for him, such an approach has allowed former policymakers to escape culpability for mistakes that heightened tensions with other countries and led to human rights abuses and even military defeat.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s Unending Wars: Fronting the Foreign Policy of the Permanent Warfare State,\u201d therefore, while an ambitious effort to analyze Obama\u2019s foreign policy record, offers neither a nuanced nor empathetic appraisal of the former president. Nonetheless, Kuzmarov\u2019s book is serious and fair and should prompt historians \u2014 and the rest of us \u2014 to reevaluate Obama\u2019s legacy.\n\nKuzmarov\u2019s primary criticism of Obama\u2019s foreign policy is that it institutionalized a permanent warfare state, despite promises to the contrary. On the campaign trail, Obama had cultivated an image as a peace candidate. But rather than living up to his campaign promises, and using his immense rhetorical skills to reverse the policies of his predecessor, he largely used them to cover for continuing George W. Bush\u2019s foreign policies, including solidifying a surveillance state, punishing whistleblowers and expanding drone attacks.\n\nObama\u2019s hawkish foreign policies were evident around the globe. Take Africa: Kuzmarov argues that Obama employed the same paternalistic lens as his white predecessors and \u201cpromoted the colonialist assumption that America and its institutions were superior \u2026 while burying the West\u2019s complicities\u201d in crimes committed by allies including closing down critical media outlets, rigging elections and torturing or murdering the political opposition.\n\nSeeing the region through this lens dictated an expansion of U.S. military bases and military training in Africa, slashing funding for AIDS treatment and backing some of the continent's most oppressive regimes. Obama even removed restrictions on funding regimes that used child soldiers, while claiming to protect human rights by sending U.S. troops to hunt down warlords like Joseph Kony (who used child soldiers).\n\nThe gap between Obama\u2019s rhetoric and his foreign policies extended to the Middle East. Kuzmarov\u2019s chapter on Libya arguably best demonstrates the shortcomings of Obama\u2019s policies. It portrays both Obama and his first-term secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, as hawks who did not seriously consider the consequences of the military intervention to oust Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi. The American intervention resulted in a failed state after the Libyan parliament replicated the disastrous policy the United States had pursued in Iraq: barring anyone who worked for the previous regime from holding office.\n\nA similar disaster followed U.S. intervention in Syria. Despite waging a war against Islamic radicalism, the administration supported Islamist militants in its effort to topple dictator Bashar al-Assad. It also relied on reports by the White Helmets, a group with links to fundamentalists, to demonize Syria and galvanize support for U.S. intervention.\n\nKuzmarov\u2019s criticism should not be dismissed simply as a defense of Assad. It raises a broader and troubling question: Why is the United States still arming radical Islamic paramilitaries, given how badly this has backfired in the past, most especially in Afghanistan?\n\nThese policies largely evaded scrutiny because of Obama\u2019s hope-filled rhetoric. But according to Kuzmarov, that language was often chimerical. The president\u2019s much-lauded June 4, 2009, address to a massive crowd at Cairo University, for example, held out the promise for a \u201cnew beginning\u201d in U.S. relations with the Muslim world. But the president continuously undermined this goal with his policies, including working with the Egyptian military to overthrow a Muslim Brotherhood-led government, supporting Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen and remaining a steadfast ally of Israel, even after its brutal siege of Gaza.\n\nMost controversially, Kuzmarov accuses Obama of triggering a new cold war between Russia and the United States. This argument builds upon those presented in more depth in an earlier co-written book, \u201cThe Russians Are Coming, Again: The First Cold War as Tragedy, the Second as Farce.\u201d\n\nKuzmarov\u2019s willingness to blame Obama for the deteriorating relationship between the United States and Russia stems in part from seeing Vladimir Putin far more sympathetically than most. He sees the Russian strongman as a nationalist determined to restore Russian prominence and ignores Putin\u2019s alleged involvement in the deaths of his political opponents, viewing accusations of such involvement as unsubstantiated.\n\nWhen Putin is viewed through this lens, it is easier for Kuzmarov to criticize Obama\u2019s handling of Russia. The administration\u2019s support of the Maidan protests in Ukraine, triggered by the Ukrainian government\u2019s decision to pursue closer relations with Russia, therefore, is depicted not as a stand for democracy and freedom, but as an action that further poisoned relations between Russia and the United States. Even worse, it empowered a violent and corrupt Ukrainian government that makes a mockery of the White House\u2019s professed concern for human rights. Kuzmarov directly links this to the annexation of Crimea, arguing that it reflected the will of the Crimean people as the Ukrainian government grew more corrupt.\n\nKuzmarov also disputes the standard progressive narrative about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He argues that Democrats have used this contention to cover their shortcomings and deflect blame. This overreaction by the party and its progressive allies has obscured what Kuzmarov sees as the reality: Obama, not Donald Trump, led the country into another confrontation with Russia that could potentially result in a nuclear war.\n\nEven though readers may question Kuzmarov\u2019s portrayal of Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 elections, his analysis of Putin\u2019s rise to power and explanation of the Russian president\u2019s policies as a reaction against a decade of post-Cold War U.S. foreign policy rest on solid ground. Simply dismissing Kuzmarov\u2019s discussion as hyperbolic or contrarian without interrogating and investigating his claims further would risk skewing our understanding of Obama.\n\nWhile mostly tough, but fair, Kuzmarov\u2019s book could have benefited from an in-depth discussion of several of Obama\u2019s proudest foreign policy accomplishments: the nuclear deal with Iran and rapprochement with Cuba.\n\nRegarding the latter, Kuzmarov faults Obama for not acknowledging previous historic crimes committed by the United States and depicts the opening as an effort to promote the privatization of the island. But this move, which reversed more than a half-century of ineffective American policy, challenges Kuzmarov\u2019s hawkish portrayal of Obama. Given the current administration\u2019s reversion to a more bellicose posture designed to trigger regime change, Obama\u2019s attempt at conciliation represented a positive interlude in U.S.-Cuban relations.\n\nSimilarly, Kuzmarov criticizes Obama\u2019s false narrative of Iran\u2019s burgeoning nuclear program as the gravest threat in the Middle East. As the author reminds his audience, evidence offered by arms experts demonstrates that Iran had halted its program years earlier. But again, while offering a necessary corrective to overly positive accounts of the deal, Kuzmarov does not place the policy in a broader history of relations between the two countries. While some of Obama\u2019s rhetoric embraced troubling narratives, his policy represented a fresh, decidedly unhawkish corrective to decades of Washington\u2019s intransigence. It is in these areas where Kuzmarov\u2019s lack of historical context detracts from an overall ambitious and admirable work.\n\nPeople who revere Obama, and view his presidency as a semblance of normality, will not appreciate Kuzmarov\u2019s offering. Many will especially dispute some of his characterizations about the president, including his role as a \u201cfrontman\u201d for the military-industrial complex. But dismissing Kuzmarov\u2019s book would be a mistake. While his claims can be construed as hyperbolic and open to challenge, the book includes worthy criticism that demonstrates the costs of Obama\u2019s \u201cpragmatism\u201d: a more entrenched permanent warfare state, heightened tensions with Russia and potentially a new cold war.", "description": "Or so argues a credible new book that presents a harshly critical take on President Obama\u2019s foreign policy.", "authors": ["Brian D'Haeseleer", "Brian D'Haeseleer Teaches U.S. History At Lyon College", "Is The Author Of", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9RVm98x8rfBU4wkLBJpR-CMY298=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E4Q2GVGLIUI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
