Visitors to this new autumn event will find the park decked in some 10,000 pumpkins, including 2,500 hand-carved pumpkins reflecting various themes around the park and 5,000 real pumpkins.\n\nThese aren't just your everyday jack-o-lanterns. A three-story Pumpkin Greeter welcomes guests into this new experience. A series of eight-foot-tall Pumpkin Craftsmen statues represent the park's demonstrating craftsmen and women \u2014 blacksmiths, candy makers, glass blowers, and potters.\n\nHand-carved pumpkins feature clever details, like ride silhouettes and depictions of Ozark critters (squirrels, turtles and a mother bear with her three cubs investigating a tableau of a camping tend with a glowing pumpkin campfire).\n\nA new area, called the Pumpkin Plaza, hosts nightly black light dance parties, complete with pumpkin-infused treats \u2014 pumpkin spice funnel cakes, churros with pumpkin fluff, pumpkin whoopie pies and pumpkin cinnamon rolls. Rides remain open after dark, offering park goers the opportunity to see the park aglow while spinning through Time Traveler or plunging down one of the world's steepest wooden roller coaster drops on Outlaw Run.\n\nThe Craft Days portion of the festival welcomes new artisans to the park to demonstrate their skills and sell handmade items, ranging from handmade soaps and silver jewelry to custom carved foam pumpkins and painted gourds.\n\nThe event is scheduled to run through October 26, with Christmas festivities beginning promptly on November 2.", "description": "Silver Dollar City debuted its biggest fall festival in its 60 year history this week.
