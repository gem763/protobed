Mary appears to be looking towards Jesus and the angel instead of John the Baptist. \u201cThe angle of the Infant Christ\u2019s head was changed so that he was seen in profile, while some parts of the angel\u2019s curly hair have been removed,\u201d the museum notes in a press release.\n\nThe research is part of the National Gallery\u2019s upcoming exhibit, \u201cLeonardo: Experience A Masterpiece,\u201d which opens on Nov. 9. You can book tickets to the immersive exhibit centered around the \u201cVirgin of the Rocks\u201d here.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
