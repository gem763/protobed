Here's What He Says Happened", "language": "en", "text": "Saul Eugene, 23, knew he was walking into hostile territory when he attended Thursday night\u2019s Trump rally in Minneapolis wearing a Colin Kaepernick jersey. But he never expected to be ejected from the venue.\n\nTrump has very publicly disparaged Kaepernick and other NFL players who\u2019ve knelt during the National Anthem in protest of police violence and racial injustice. Eugene is a self-described \u201cpolitical operative\u201d who says he\u2019s worked for a variety of Democratic politicians in Minnesota. Wearing a Kaepernick jersey, he tells TIME, \u201cwas an easy way to send a message, without having to use too many words.\u201d\n\nWhat, exactly, is that message? \u201cI think it\u2019s strength,\u201d says Eugene in the first interview he\u2019s given about the ejection, which was captured on camera and began to go viral on Friday. Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since the 2016 season, when he began his protest. Earlier on Thursday, Kaepernick\u2019s representatives had released a statement noting that he has been \u201cworking out 5 days a week, for 3 years, in preparation to play again,\u201d and lamenting that not a single team has even brought him in for a workout.\n\n\u201c[Kaepernick] essentially gave up his whole career to fight for the things he believed in,\u201d says Eugene. Of Trump, he continued, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about a candidate who thrives off of white males who feel that their privilege is being threatened by minorities, women, all of that stuff. A black man willing to use his platform to step up and speak out on a lot of the atrocities that are committed across this country on a regular basis, it scares them. It\u2019s everything they fear. They\u2019re losing their control and their upper hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t walk around and talk to every Trump supporter and have them feel what I\u2019m saying,\u201d says Eugene. \u201cBut there is power in imagery and power in symbols. Kaepernick has become one of those symbols.\u201d\n\nAccording to Eugene, he wore a jacket over his jersey until arriving at his seat. During one of the speeches at the rally before the President talked, Eugene said he laughed at a point he disagreed with. \u201cI wasn\u2019t laughing any louder than people were cheering,\u201d he says. \u201cSure, it was audible. But it wasn\u2019t an act of aggression in any way.\u201d\n\nStill, Eugene says a man sitting in the row in front of him turned around to confront him and, he claims, threatened to hit him. Eugene says he winked at the man in response, and said \u201cI dare you.\u201d The man called over a security guard who, at first, declined to kick Eugene out. Then Eugene laughed a few more times; he says the man turned around again, called him names and then made a phone call. Security soon came down again, this time telling Eugene he was \u201cuninvited\u201d from the event.\n\nAs he walked out of the arena, Eugene blew kisses. The crowd became to heckle him: someone said \u201cf\u2013k Kaepernick,\u201d according to Eugene, and he said he also heard someone yell the N-word. (Eugene is white.) He says the police who escorted him out were polite and professional, adding that they said they were just following orders.\n\nA Minneapolis Police Department official told TIME that Target Center security had ordered Eugene\u2019s removal; the Target Center did not return a request for comment. TIME reached out to both the White House and the Trump 2020 campaign for comment: the White House referred TIME to the campaign, which did not return the request. Through Twitter, TIME reached out to the man who allegedly confronted Eugene and summoned security. He has yet to provide a comment.\n\nEugene knows some people will believe he attended for the sole rally of getting kicked out and receiving attention \u2014 but he says that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cThey can say what they want,\u201d he says. \u201cI was prepared to be kicked out if that\u2019s what it led to. I was prepared to be very un-liked and show my stance. The thing is, it\u2019s unwavering. It you\u2019re on the right side of history, you\u2019re on the right side of history.\u201d", "description": "Saul Eugene, 23, attended Trump's rally in Minnesota wearing a Kaepernick jersey.
