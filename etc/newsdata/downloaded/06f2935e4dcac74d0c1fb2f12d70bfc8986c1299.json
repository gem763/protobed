The juggernaut has left many women feeling pressured to undergo screenings, which, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, haven\u2019t been shown to be more effective than traditional mammograms.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money to be made,\u201d said Dr. Steven Woloshin, director of the Center for Medicine and Media at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, who published a study in January showing that the health care industry spends $30 billion a year on marketing.\n\nKHN\u2019s investigation shows that industry money has shaped policy, public opinion and patient care around 3D by:\n\nPaying influential doctors . In the past six years, 3D equipment manufacturers \u2013 including Hologic, GE Healthcare, Siemens Medical Solutions USA and Fujifilm Medical Systems USA \u2013 have paid doctors and teaching hospitals more than $240 million, including more than $9.2 million related to 3D mammograms, according to a KHN analysis of the Medicare Open Payments database. Just over half of that money was related to research; other payments covered speaking fees, consulting, travel, meals or drinks. The database shows that influential journal articles \u2013 those cited hundreds of times by other researchers \u2013 were written by doctors with financial ties to the 3D industry.\n\n.

Marketing directly to consumers . Manufacturers have urged women to demand \u201cthe better mammogram,\u201d using celebrity spokeswomen such as breast cancer survivor Sheryl Crow. Manufacturers spent $14 million to market 3D screening over the past four years, not including spending on social media, according to Kantar Media, which tracks the advertising industry.\n\n.

Lobbying state lawmakers . Private insurers in 16 states are now legally required to cover 3D screenings, along with Medicaid programs in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Officials at Hologic, the leading manufacturer, told KHN that about 95% of insured women have coverage for tomosynthesis.\n\n.

Officials at Hologic, the leading manufacturer, told KHN that about 95% of insured women have coverage for tomosynthesis. Funding experts and advocates. Hologic has given educational grants to the American Society of Breast Surgeons, a medical association that recently recommended 3D mammograms as its preferred screening method, according to the group\u2019s website. Hologic declined to reveal amounts. Hologic also has funded patient advocates such as the Black Women\u2019s Health Imperative, which lobbies for access to 3D mammograms.\n\nEnthusiasm for 3D has sparked a medical technology arms race, with hospitals and radiology practices competing to offer the newest equipment. Patients have caught the fever, too. When rural hospitals can\u2019t afford 3D machines, foundations often pitch in to raise money. More than 63% of mammography facilities offer 3D screenings, first approved for sale in 2011.\n\nTaxpayers write the check for many 3D screenings, which add about $50 to the cost of a typical mammogram. Medicare, which began paying for 3D exams in 2015, spent an additional $230 million on breast cancer screenings within the first three years of coverage. By 2017, nearly half the mammograms paid for by the federal program were 3D, according to a KHN analysis of federal data.\n\nCDC report:STDs reach all-time high for 5th year in a row, and it's killing babies\n\nHologic\u2019s Peter Valenti said the company\u2019s marketing is educational. His company is a \u201cfor-profit organization, but our premise is to try to improve the health care for women globally,\u201d said Valenti, president of Hologic\u2019s breast and skeletal health solutions division.\n\nThe debate over 3D mammograms illustrates the tension in the medical community over how much research companies should do before commercializing new products. In a statement, officials at Hologic said it would be \u201cirresponsible and unethical\u201d to withhold technology that detects more breast cancers, given that definitive clinical trials can take many years.\n\nOn average, 3D screenings may slightly increase cancer detection rates, finding about one extra breast tumor for every 1,000 U.S. women screened, according to a 2018 analysis in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Most studies also show that 3D screenings cause fewer \u201cfalse alarms,\u201d in which women are called back for procedures they don\u2019t need, said Dr. Susan Harvey, a Hologic vice president.\n\nYet newer tech isn\u2019t necessarily better \u2013 and it can cause harm, said Dr. Otis Brawley, a professor at John Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s unethical to push a product before you know it helps people,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic race:Think \u2018Medicare For All\u2019 is the only health plan? Think again\n\nA fuzzy picture\n\nAs a senior researcher at the National Cancer Institute, McCaskill-Stevens didn\u2019t need a glossy brochure to learn about 3D mammograms. She helped design a $100 million federally funded study of 165,000 women, which will measure whether women are helped or hurt by 3D testing. The study, now recruiting patients, will follow the women for five years.\n\n\u201cCan we say that 3D is better?\u201d asked McCaskill-Stevens. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe American Cancer Society, Susan G. Komen and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force also say there isn\u2019t yet enough evidence to advise women on 3D mammograms.\n\nWhen the Food and Drug Administration approved the first 3D mammography system, made by Hologic, the agency required the technology to be safe and effective at finding breast cancer \u2013 not at improving survival.\n\n\u201cThe companies do the minimal research needed to get FDA approval, and that usually means no meaningful evidence of how it helps patients,\u201d said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research.\n\nValenti said Hologic presented strong evidence to the FDA. \u201cThe data was overwhelming that 3D was a superior mammogram,\u201d Valenti said.\n\nDescribing a breast exam as 3D may conjure up images of holograms or virtual reality. In fact, tomosynthesis is closer to a mini-CT scan.\n\nAlthough all mammograms use X-rays, conventional 2D screenings provide two views of each breast, one from top to bottom and one from the side. 3D screenings take pictures from multiple angles, producing dozens or hundreds of images, and take only a few seconds longer.\n\nYet some studies suggest that 3D mammograms are less accurate than 2D.\n\nA 2016 study in The Lancet Oncology found that women screened with 3D mammograms had more false alarms. A randomized trial of 29,000 women published in The Lancet in June showed that 3D detected no more breast tumors than 2D mammograms did.\n\nAnd, like all mammograms, the 3D version carries risks. Older 3D systems expose women to twice as much radiation as a 2D mammogram, although those levels are still considered safe, said Diana Miglioretti, a biostatistics professor at the University of California-Davis School of Medicine.\n\nValenti said the newest 3D systems provide about the same radiation dose as 2D.\n\nDiagnosing more cancers doesn\u2019t necessarily help women, Brawley said. That\u2019s because not all breast tumors are life-threatening; some grow so slowly that women would live just as long if they ignored them \u2013 or never even knew they were there. Finding these tumors often leads women to undergo treatments they don\u2019t need.\n\n'This is a big win':Pesticide linked to brain damage in children banned in California\n\nA 2017 study estimated 1 in 3 women with breast cancer detected by a mammogram are treated unnecessarily. It\u2019s possible 3D mammograms make that problem worse, by finding even more small, slow-growing breast tumors than 2D, said Dr. Alex Krist, vice chairman of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an expert panel that issues health advice. By steering women toward 3D mammograms before all the evidence is in, \u201cwe could potentially hurt women,\u201d Krist said.\n\nSome experts worry that patients, who tend to overestimate their risk of dying from breast cancer, are acting out of fear when they choose treatment.\n\n\u201cIf there was ever an audience susceptible to direct-to-consumer advertising, it\u2019s women afraid of breast cancer,\u201d Zuckerman said.\n\nSome proponents of 3D mammograms imply that women who opt for 2D are taking a risk.\n\nDr. Liane Philpotts, chief of breast imaging at Yale School of Medicine, championed a 2016 Connecticut bill to mandate insurance coverage for 3D screenings. \u201cWhen I look at a 2D mammogram now, I don\u2019t know how we read them with any degree of confidence,\u201d Philpotts said in a letter of support. \u201cThey seem grossly inadequate.\u201d\n\nPhilpotts\u2019 letter did not mention she has worked as a consultant for Hologic, which paid her $13,500 from 2013 to 2018, mostly for research, according to Open Payments. In an interview, Philpotts said her work for Hologic has not influenced her medical advice. \u201c[Tomosynthesis is] just so much better for patients,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel very passionately about it.\u201d\n\nDr. Linda Greer, a community radiologist in Phoenix, has said she was \u201cshocked\u201d by how many more tumors were detected with 3D than 2D. In a 2013 interview, she told Everyday Health, \u201cWe got scared about what we were missing for so many years\u201d with 2D mammograms. Greer has accepted more than $305,000 from makers of mammography machines, including $222,000 related to 3D products, according to the Open Payments database.\n\nGreer noted she maintains her intellectual independence by writing her own presentations, even if Hologic pays for her travel. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could be bought,\u201d she said.\n\nBuilding a brand\n\nThe first question many women have about 3D mammograms is: Are they less painful?\n\nIn ads, Hologic claims its 3D device was less painful for 93% of women. But that claim comes from a company-funded study that hasn\u2019t been formally reviewed by outside experts, Zuckerman noted. Given the limited data provided in the study, it\u2019s possible the findings were the result of chance, said Zuckerman, who called the ads \u201cvery misleading.\u201d\n\nValenti said peer review is important in studies about cancer detection or false alarms. But when it relates to \u201cgeneral patient satisfaction or patient preference, those are data that we get in other ways,\u201d he said. \u201cPlenty of [doctors] have the [3D] system now and you can get feedback from them. \u201c\n\nWhile screenings may not generate a lot of income, they can attract patients who need other, more profitable hospital procedures.\n\n\u201cAnytime you diagnose more tumors, you can treat more tumors,\u201d said Amitabh Chandra, director of health policy research at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government\n\nChanging the law\n\nFor years, women who wanted a 3D screening had to pay an extra $50 to $100 out-of-pocket.\n\nValenti said Hologic wanted more women to have access to the technology. So Hologic launched a public campaign \u2013 with a website, paid celebrity tweets and billboards \u2013 to pressure private insurers to cover 3D.\n\nHospitals and radiology practices \u2013 who stand to benefit from an expanded pool of paying customers \u2013 are also fierce advocates for insurance coverage.\n\nIn 2017, a doctor at New York\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center asked a local assemblywoman to introduce a bill mandating insurance coverage for 3D screenings.\n\nIn a statement, an official at Memorial Sloan Kettering said the hospital supported the bill to improve patient care. \u201cOur patients deserved the most optimal screening available,\u201d said Dr. Elizabeth Morris, chief of the hospital\u2019s breast imaging service.\n\nSupporters of 3D mammograms also rallied around an insurance mandate in Texas in 2017. Registered supporters included HCA Healthcare, a for-profit chain that manages 185 hospitals, and the Black Women\u2019s Health Imperative. That group also testified before an FDA panel in 2010 to advocate approving Hologic\u2019s device.\n\nLinda Goler Blount, the group\u2019s president and CEO, said the organization was advocating for early detection long before its partnership with Hologic began in 2016.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re low-income, you\u2019re much less likely to get 3D mammography than if you\u2019re upper-income,\u201d Blount said.\n\nBlount noted that her group remains \u201cindependent and free to speak our mind.\u201d\n\nPaying doctors\n\nDr. Stephen Rose has been an especially active advocate for 3D screenings.\n\nRose, a radiologist, testified on behalf of the Texas insurance bill twice. The practice where Rose works, Solis Mammography, put out press releases in favor of the legislation. In 2010, Rose testified in favor of 3D screenings at an FDA advisory panel.\n\nIn the past six years, he has received $317,000 from companies that manufacture mammogram machines, including more than $50,000 related to specific 3D products, according to the Open Payments database. Twelve percent of Rose\u2019s 3D-related payments were related to research.\n\nRose said industry money hasn\u2019t influenced him. \u201cI can tell you it had zero impact,\u201d Rose said.\n\nIn 2014, Rose co-wrote an influential paper that described the benefits of 3D mammograms.\n\nCollectively, Rose and 12 of his co-authors accepted more than $1 million from the four leading manufacturers of 3D equipment over the past six years, including $589,000 related to 3D products, according to a KHN analysis of Open Payments data. In addition, Hologic contributed $855,000 to research in which many of these authors took leading roles.\n\nValenti said Hologic doesn\u2019t expect anything in return for the payments: \u201cWe let the product and the doctor speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nA web of relationships\n\nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons lists Hologic as a corporate partner. In May, the society recommended 3D mammograms as its preferred screening method.\n\n\u201cThere is no connection between the society\u2019s educational grants and statement development,\u201d said Sharon Grutman, a society spokeswoman.\n\nFran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, has advocated for women for decades. But she said she\u2019s at a loss for a solution to curtail industry influence in medicine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly troubling,\u201d said Visco, a breast cancer survivor. \u201cEveryone has a different stake in all this, and it all seems to be tied to financial gain.\u201d", "description": "An investigation found that millions of marketing dollars have pushed 3D mammograms, leaving many women feeling pressured to undergo screenings", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/16/USAT/a1544b4a-5c85-454d-97e3-79a67ff29dba-3D_Mammography_KHN_illustration.jpg?crop=2399,1349,x0,y238&width=2023&height=1349&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
