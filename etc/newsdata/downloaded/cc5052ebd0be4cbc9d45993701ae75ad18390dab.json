They've put their bodies on the line every weekend,\" said Japan coach Jamie Joseph, who has compared his players Ferraris.\n\n\"But tonight they went another level I felt. They obviously wanted that game as much as the Scottish team did. They gave everything they possibly could.\n\n\"Everyone that entered the game, from our most experienced to our least experienced, gave 150 percent and that's what it takes to win big Test matches.\"\n\nScotland needed to win while preventing Japan from securing a defensive bonus point - and they got off to a flying start.\n\nEarly pressure told as flyhalf Finn Russell broke through to give them the lead after just seven minutes.\n\nBut the Japanese hit back quickly with Matsushima latching onto a superb, one-handed offload from Fukuoka to score his fifth try of the tournament.\n\nEven better was to come from the hosts with a dazzling move straight out of a basketball playbook, quick hands between Shota Horie and William Tupou releasing loosehead prop Keita Inagaki to crash over.\n\nOn the stroke of half-time, the jet-heeled Fukuoka plucked a high-bouncing Timothy Lafaele grubber kick out of the air to leave Scotland with a mountain to climb.\n\nFukuoka then produced a moment of solo brilliance moments into the second half, stripping the ball from Chris Harris before accelerating clear.\n\nScotland, who had bounced back from a 27-3 drubbing by Ireland to smash Samoa 34-0 and Russia 61-0, looked out of it.\n\nWhen WP Nel and Zander Fagerson bulldozed over in the space of five minutes, suddenly the Japanese were creaking.\n\nBut they stood firm in the face of a late barrage to avenge a 45-10 defeat by Scotland that cost them a place in the knockout stages of the 2015 World Cup.\n\nThat team, led by Eddie Jones, won three matches, including a breathless 34-32 victory over South Africa in their opening game.\n\nJapan's current vintage thrashed Russia 30-10 and Samoa 38-19 either side of their massive win over Ireland and coach Jamie Joseph will relish the chance to have another crack at the Springboks.\n\nScorers\n\nJapan\n\nTries: Kotaro Matsushima, Keita Inagaki, Kenki Fukuoka (2)\n\nConversions: Yu Tamura (4)\n\nScotland\n\nTries: Finn Russell, WP Nel, Zander Fagerson\n\nConversions: Greig Laidlaw (3)\n\nTeams\n\nJapan\n\n15 William Tupou, 14 Kotaro Matsushima, 13 Timothy Lafaele, 12 Ryoto Nakamura, 11 Kenki Fukuoka, 10 Yu Tamura, 9 Yutaka Nagare, 8 Kazuki Himeno, 7 Pieter Labuschagne, 6 Michael Leitch (captain), 5 James Moore, 4 Luke Thompson, 3 Jiwon Koo, 2 Shota Horie, 1 Keita Inagaki.\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Atsushi Sakate, 17 Isileli Nakajima, 18 Asaeli Ai Valu, 19 Uwe Helu, 20 Hendrik Tui, 21 Fumiaki Tanaka, 22 Rikiya Matsuda, 23 Ryohei Yamanaka\n\nScotland\n\n15 Stuart Hogg, 14 Tommy Seymour, 13 Chris Harris, 12 Sam Johnson, 11 Darcy Graham 10 Finn Russell, 9 Greig Laidlaw (captain), 8 Blade Thomson, 7 Jamie Ritchie, 6 Magnus Bradbury, 5 Jonny Gray, 4 Grant Gilchrist, 3 Willem Nel, 2 Fraser Brown, 1 Allan Dell.\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Stuart McInally, 17 Gordon Reid, 18 Zander Fagerson, 19 Scott Cummings, 20 Ryan Wilson, 21 George Horne, 22 Pete Horne, 23 Blair Kinghorn", "description": "Japan have beaten Scotland in an epic encounter at the Rugby World Cup and in doing so, setup a quarter-final clash against the Springboks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7919/c07bf7a8003343d99f084f139d2ae56e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
