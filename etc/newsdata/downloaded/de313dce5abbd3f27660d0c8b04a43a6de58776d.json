Kamala Harris: Mandatory gun buybacks are 'a good idea'", "language": "en", "text": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala D. Harris said Monday night that she supports a mandatory federal gun buyback program like the one proposed by fellow candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nDuring her appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d Ms. Harris took a question from a Fordham University student, who asked whether she supported a mandatory buyback on \u201cassault weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do believe that we need to do buybacks, and I\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d the California senator responded. \u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s be clear about what assault weapons are. They have been designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly. They are weapons of war with no place on the streets of a civil society. I\u2019ve seen assault weapons kill babies and police officers.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris said she planned to take executive action on gun control if Congress failed to act within 100 days of her presidency, including a federal ban on assault weapons and a \u201ccomprehensive background check requirement.\u201d\n\n\u201cA buyback program is a good idea. Now we need to do it the right way,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd part of that has to be, you know, buy back and give people their value, the financial value of what they have and not just take things from people that have value without compensating them. We need to do it the right way.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris\u2018 comments come less than a week after Mr. O\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman who has proposed a mandatory buyback aided by local law enforcement, declared during the third Democratic primary debate, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
