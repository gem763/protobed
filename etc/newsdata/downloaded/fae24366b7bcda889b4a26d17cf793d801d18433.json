NBC News\u2019 national security reporter Ken Dilanian then presented this \u201cfact check\u201d based on what he said he\u2019s been told:\n\nFact check: Experts are already saying the US just granted Ergogan everything he wanted, all along, including exclusive rights to patrol the safe zone by air. They are calling this a total capitulation. \u2014 Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) October 17, 2019\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, has previously not been shy about calling out the media, and he did so again when it came to Dilanian\u2019s claim:\n\nSometimes it\u2019s necessary to call out BS. This is one of those times: Dilanian regularly makes stuff up. Most everyone knows this. His political agenda means he uses anonymous sources regularly \u2013 and they are fake. He is an opinion writer and should be labeled as such. https://t.co/YqVqU74Gjm \u2014 Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) October 18, 2019\n\nWell, there it is!\n\nIt\u2019s weird how the same people who bashed Trump as a warmonger are now bashing him for not being a warmonger. \u2014 Nathan Acreman (@NateAcreman1) October 18, 2019\n\nHe works for NBC. Nothing more to say. \u2014 Pamela Scott (@PamelaS99694909) October 18, 2019\n\n\"Experts say \u2026\" First, the argument is lost when you reference anonymous \"experts\". Second, anyone with first-hand experience knows that \"the experts\" aren't. \u2014 Radical Radials (@EchelonRight) October 18, 2019\n\nThe media hasn\u2019t exactly had a banner month covering the Syria story so it\u2019s no wonder their reports are often met with skepticism.", "description": "Ouch.", "authors": ["Doug P.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/richard-grenell-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
