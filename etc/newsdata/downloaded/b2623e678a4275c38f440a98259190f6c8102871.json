In 2019 alone, despite the MSCI World Index posting a 16% return, investors have pulled $349 billion from global stocks, exceeding the crisis-hit 2008 redemptions by 40%, according to EPFR Global data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really remarkable how geopolitical issues have taken so much mind share and dominate what people are doing with their portfolios,\u201d Mossavar-Rahmani told reporters in London on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to us how money has gone into the worst-performing assets.\"\n\nThe Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index has returned 28% since September 2009, compared with a total return of 250% for the S&P 500 Index. Many investors have preferred to stay on the sidelines of this year\u2019s stock rally as they fear that elevated valuations pose a risk at the end of the cycle.\n\nGoldman Wealth Management dismisses the fears as unwarranted. The strength of U.S. labor productivity, innovation and demographics make the asset manager rate the probability of a recession at just 30% over the next 12 months. And with the S&P 500 trading at a 10% discount to its 2017 highs on a forward price-to-earnings basis and equity funds bleeding cash, there\u2019s little risk of over-crowding despite the rally, says Mossavar-Rahmani.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been that much overvaluation in equities nor that much hype,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like U.S. equities. It\u2019s remarkable considering the outperformance. We\u2019re nowhere near dotcom bubble levels.\"\n\nWhile bonds can give investors exposure to lower rates, Goldman\u2019s Private Wealth Management recommends being underweight fixed income to fund investments in U.S. equities and other areas, Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ksenia Galouchko in London at kgalouchko1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Blaise Robinson at brobinson58@bloomberg.net, Jon Menon, John Viljoen\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has a simple yet firm message for its wealthy clients: stick with U.S. equities.\u201cAs we\u2019ve gone through various crises, we\u2019ve still told clients to stay invested and not get out of U.S. equities, it\u2019s too early,\u201d said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer", "authors": ["Ksenia Galouchko"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iSaUAZ.jlcitmrpCVRnfrg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/1b6882727e917bac5f41b11616c303ce", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
