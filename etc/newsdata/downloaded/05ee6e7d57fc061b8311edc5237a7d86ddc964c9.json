Think about it: did Carrie make them up? She\u2019s telling a story every week. This is her point of view, it\u2019s almost always her point of view,\u201d Parker added.\n\nSJP\u2019s jaw-dropping theory doesn\u2019t end there \u2014 she points to further evidence. \u201cWhen Carrie went to Paris and left her computer, for the first time Carrie wasn\u2019t telling the story. In the entire run of the series, if you think about it for a second, right?\u201d Parker said.\n\nSARAH JESSICA PARKER CLAIMS 'BIG MOVIE STAR' BEHAVED 'INAPPROPRIATELY' ON 'SEX AND THE CITY' SET\n\n'SEX AND THE CITY' CREATOR CANDACE BUSHNELL SAYS CHRIS NOTH INTRODUCED HER TO MR. BIGGER: 'HE\u2019S A NEW TYPE'\n\n\u201cShe left her computer which was the conduit (through) which the audiences know about Charlotte, Miranda \u2026 Samantha.\u201d\n\nWhile \"Sex and the City\" ran for six seasons \u2014 and two movies (with a third completely ruled out) \u2014 originally on TV from 1998-2004, it is on constant repeat.\n\n\u201cThese friendships, real or not real, as described were beyond a source of joy and a connection and a way of relating, they were a necessity,\u201d Parker said, of the series\u2019 enduring popularity.\n\n\u201cI think that that really made an impact on audiences because either they were feeling that way \u2026 or they wanted to feel that way,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCarrie was unusual in that she was conveying with words and actions, a life that thus far had not been shared on TV.\n\n'SEX AND THE CITY' AUTHOR CANDACE BUSHNELL REGRETS NOT HAVING KIDS, SAYS SHE WAS 'TRULY ALONE'\n\nCYNTHIA NIXON THINKS IF 'SEX AND THE CITY' WERE MADE NOW IT WOULDN'T FEATURE AN ALL-WHITE CAST: 'GOD FORBID'\n\n\u201cAnd she was like a contradiction \u2026 and a woman pursuing a life simply for herself, which was almost, like, \u2018what what what?'\n\n\u201cI just think there was a lot that hadn\u2019t yet been told about women on TV.\u201d\n\nThough Parker, 54, admits the show was, in many ways, a \u201cperiod piece\u201d and about a particular \u201ctime\u201d in New York City, rather than reflective of today\u2019s modern society.\n\n\u201cIt really does speak of a socio-economic group of women particular to New York at that time, it speaks of a political time, of an economy that\u2019s different,\u201d Parker told News Corp Australia.\n\nSince then, Parker has starred in another TV series for US network HBO, \"Divorce,\" which ended in August after three seasons.\n\nSARAH JESSICA PARKER TALKS NEW FILM \u2018HERE AND NOW,\u2019 \u2018SEX AND THE CITY 3\u2019 SCRIPT EXISTING\n\n'SEX AND THE CITY 3' WOULD HAVE REPORTEDLY KILLED OFF MR. BIG\n\nThis week, she has been in Australia for a series of events, including an appearance at Chemist Warehouse for the relaunch of her perfume collection and signature scent \u201cLovely.\"\n\nWith multiple businesses under her belt, Parker reflected on the lessons she has learned from her business moves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for you and other young women to do the thing they feel is interesting and argue their point, as far as you can,\u201d Parker told News Corp.\n\n\u201cFight for the story that you want to be telling and the way that you want to tell it.\n\n\u201cYou are your own person, you have a point of view, you should be heard. And so I just think it makes for things that feel more personal and specific.\u201d\n\nSARAH JESSICA PARKER SAYS 'SEX AND THE CITY' WAS \u2018SUFFOCATING\u2019: 'IT FELT LIKE SOMEBODY WAS HOLDING ME HOSTAGE'\n\n'SEX AND THE CITY' STARS SARAH JESSICA PARKER, KIM CATTRALL FEUDED OVER THIS REASON, SAYS EXECUTIVE PRODUCER\n\nAs for her style icon status \u2014 both as Carrie on \"Sex and the City\" and as herself \u2014 SJP is decidedly low-key.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really good at describing me,\u201d Parker said of her dress sense.\n\nFYI, she is wearing a spotty pink Batsheva dress with statement buttons, a pair of heels from SJP Collection, and with her hair in Carrie-esque beachy waves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s me and then there\u2019s the show. I understand the impact of that portrait,\u201d Parker said.\n\n\u201cPat (SATC costume designer Patricia Field) and I worked really hard on that and I remember the moment we decided to put a flower on the lapel of my coat, I remember it specifically.\n\n'SEX AND THE CITY' STAR KRISTIN DAVIS GETS EMOTIONAL DISCUSSING THE RACISM HER ADOPTED KIDS EXPERIENCE\n\n\u2018SEX AND THE CITY\u2019 STAR CHRIS NOTH, 64, EXPECTING SECOND CHILD WITH WIFE TARA WILSON\n\n\u201cI remember when we kept going back \u2014 oh, this is this season!
