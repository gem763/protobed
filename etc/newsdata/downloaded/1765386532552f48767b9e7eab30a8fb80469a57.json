(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nBoth the collusion and deep-state narratives have always been subordinate to the larger and deeper motives driving and sustaining political polarization.\n\nThe story is not over. It may never be over in our lifetimes. But an important chapter has come to an end, and it had a happy ending for the president.\n\nContrary to what we\u2019re already beginning to hear from some quarters of the left, the Mueller probe almost certainly puts to rest the extreme version of the Russia\u2013collusion narrative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there were compelling evidence that Donald Trump clandestinely conspired with the Russian government, it\u2019s safe to assume that special counsel Robert Mueller would have found it. And if he had found it, he would have put it in his report. And if he had put it in his report, attorney general Bill Barr would have indicated as much in his summary.\n\nEven if Barr were inclined to cover up such findings, he knows that the truth would come out \u2014 and that his career and reputation would be utterly destroyed.\n\nBut it does not \u2014 and really cannot \u2014 put to rest the softer versions of the collusion charge. Candidate Trump publicly called on the Russians to keep hacking away at Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Don Jr. and the entire senior leadership of the Trump campaign took a meeting with a self-declared emissary of the Russian government to get dirt on Hillary (and then lied about it later at the president\u2019s direction). Trump\u2019s campaign manager, currently in prison, worked with Russian-aligned oligarchs in Ukraine. Various campaign peons and hangers-on were eager to cultivate relations with Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, the ironclad conclusion of the intelligence community as well as the Mueller investigation found that Russia did indeed work to get Trump elected. The Trump campaign may have been dishonorably happy for the help, but that\u2019s not collusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd let\u2019s be clear: That is very good news. If you believed that Trump was a traitor, it\u2019s one thing to want that exposed, quite another to want it to be true, which is where a lot of people ended up.\n\nThose people will not go away, nor will they lose their adamantine convictions about the president\u2019s fitness or legitimacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich is one of the reasons why this will remain a never-ending story.\n\nLike Hillary Clinton, Trump is an avatar in a broader culture war. We\u2019re still hearing about Clinton\u2019s emails. Why should we expect the clamor over Trump\u2019s alleged collusion to end any time soon?\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, who, like most of his competitors for the Democratic nomination, is trying to personify the collective liberal id, simply ignored the news and proclaimed that he believed \u201cbeyond the shadow of a doubt\u201d that Trump sought to collude with Russia.\n\nSimilarly, just as there are people irretrievably locked into the idea that Trump is illegitimate, there are legions of people equally committed to the idea that the probe itself was an illegitimate witch hunt, or, in the president\u2019s words, an attempted \u201cillegal takedown.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNever mind that the same people who insisted that Mueller was a dirty deep-state operative doing the Clintons\u2019 bidding are now celebrating Mueller\u2019s integrity and thoroughness. (Last July, Rudy Giuliani called the probe \u201cthe most corrupt investigation I have ever seen.\u201d)\n\nBoth the collusion and the deep-state narratives have always been subordinate to the larger and deeper motives driving and sustaining political polarization.\n\nNew facts \u2014 Trump didn\u2019t collude, Mueller wasn\u2019t corrupt \u2014 are like rocks in a river. They will divert the water here or there, and perhaps create some froth and churn, but the torrent won\u2019t stop, particularly when there are so many fresh avenues for the waters to follow.\n\nThe watchword on the right these days is \u201creckoning\u201d \u2014 as in, there needs to be one for anyone who believed Trump colluded or even supported an investigation. On the left, there is a clamor for Congress to pick up where Mueller left off and a hunger for new saviors, such as the Southern District of New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea that the Mueller report itself will remain secret is a childish fantasy. And although Barr\u2019s summary may be technically accurate, one can be sure it is not comprehensive.\n\nIt is too tempting a treasure trove of anti-Trump spoils for Democrats and journalists to ignore. Likewise, all of the documents \u2014 warrants, internal memos, etc. \u2014 that birthed the investigation in the first place are too delicious for those seeking a reckoning to remain warehoused like the Ark of the Covenant in the first Indiana Jones movie.\n\nA chapter has closed, but the story goes on. Because too many people need it to.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "description": "Trump is an avatar in a broader culture war.
