The document outlines initiatives to boost growth to 3% and create over one million jobs.\n\nIt included proposals to speed up of the auction of spectrum, to reintroduce a law to cut down on red tape, to simplify onerous visa regulations, and for Eskom to consider selling coal-fired power stations.\n\nWhile the ANC caucus welcomed Mboweni's plan, the ANC's alliance partners, Cosatu and the SACP, expressed dissatisfaction. Ahead of the September 15 deadline for responses to the plan, Mboweni said Cosatu and the SACP have not yet submitted their views.\n\nRe Treasury\u2019s economic strategy paper, Mboweni said he was disappointed with response so far. \"The responses to the document have been very very poor ... there has been nothing for example from SANCO, or Cosatu. Nothing from the SACP or even the Chamber of Mines\" \u2014 Sozaboy (@MfunekoToy) September 13, 2019\n\nTelkom Group CEO Sipho Maseko also slammed the plan as being \"ill-thought-out\", in particular the plans to auction off spectrum.\n\nAccording to one report from the summit, Mboweni fired back on Friday, calling in question Maseko's objectivity.\n\n@tito_mboweni questions the failure to declare conflict of interest by the Telkom CEO in his critique of our draft macroeconomic policy. \u2014 lumkile mondi (@lmondi) September 13, 2019\n\nStruggling SOEs\n\nMboweni also took a hard line on some of the embattled state-owned entities.\n\nTito Mboweni on SA Express bailout: \"my natural answer is shut it down\" \u2014 Nick Hedley (@nickhedley) September 13, 2019\n\nMboweni also wanted Eskom's financial services unit \"out\".\n\nEstablished in 1990, Eskom Finance primarily focused on providing home loans to staff. It now has an R8.7bn loan book and about 16 000 \"customers\". Bloomberg reported last year that government was preparing to sell it.\n\n\"I have decided I am not a minister of bailouts. I am not a minister of compensation of employees in the public service, and I'm not the minister of debt management service office. I'm a minister of finance.' But they would say, 'you are minister of finance really. A huge chunk of your contingent liabilities is about bailing out SOEs, you are signing cheques on the compensation of employees, your allocations for infrastructure investment and growth is low. So that's what you're, the minister of bailouts',\" the Sowetan quoted Mboweni as saying at the event.", "description": "The finance minister also blasted critics, including the Telkom CEO, of his growth plan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9358/b55908799a4e41ca98cfcdfc07e84b2d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
