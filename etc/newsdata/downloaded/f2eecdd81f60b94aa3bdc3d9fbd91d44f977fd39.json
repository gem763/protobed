REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nLagarde, who is due to take over from Mario Draghi on Nov. 1, argued that persistently low inflation requires prolonged stimulus. But she also acknowledged that economies have changed in the last decade, with new challenges including climate change warranting a deep dive into how policy is conducted.\n\nUnprecedented shocks have forced the ECB to reinvent its toolkit over the past decade. It has now exhausted many of the unconventional measures at its disposal without lifting inflation back to its target of almost 2 percent.\n\n\u201c2003 was a long time ago and many things have changed as far as the ECB is concerned,\u201d Lagarde told the European Parliament\u2019s committee on economic affairs, referring to the ECB\u2019s last broad strategy review.\n\n\u201cMy strong belief is that the cost-benefit analysis (of policy) and possibly a review of the monetary framework that would have to be conducted, not just by the ECB, but also in coordination with other central bank institutions from around the world, is warranted, given the circumstances,\u201d she said.\n\nWith Parliament\u2019s backing, Lagarde now awaits final confirmation by euro zone leaders sometime in mid-October, a formality as the bloc appears united in supporting her nomination.\n\nAcknowledging that the ECB\u2019s primary role is to maintain price stability, Lagarde went out of her way to emphasize the institution\u2019s role in combating climate change.\n\n\u201cMy personal view is that any institution has to actually have climate change risk and protection of the environment at the core of their understanding of their mission,\u201d Lagarde said.\n\n\u201cPrimary mandate is price stability, of course. But it has to be embedded that climate change and environmental risk are mission-critical.\u201d\n\nFRESH STIMULUS\n\nAsked if she was prepared to be as bold as Draghi when he promised in 2012 to \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d to save the euro, Lagarde said that having to make such a pledge would mean others, including governments, had failed to prop up growth.\n\n\u201cI hope I never have to say something like that. I really do. Because if I had that it would mean that the other economic policymakers are not doing what they have to do,\u201d she said.\n\nLagarde largely avoided commentary on current policy but argued that a prolonged period of ultra-easy policy is necessary given global challenges, weak growth and uncomfortably low inflation.\n\nBut she said the ECB should also be mindful of the negative side-effects of unconventional measures.\n\nLagarde also appeared to support the ECB\u2019s interpretation of its inflation target as symmetrical, which would mean that after a period of undershooting the target, it could accept a period of overshooting.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nWith growth slowing and inflation falling short of the ECB\u2019s target for years, the bank has all but promised fresh stimulus when policymakers meet on Sept. 12, Draghi\u2019s penultimate meeting before he steps down on Oct 31.\n\nAs part of its package, the ECB is expected to cut rates deeper into negative territory, make a fresh promise to keep rates low for longer and compensate banks for the side-effects of negative rates.\n\nMany analysts are also convinced that the ECB will restart asset purchases, but scepticism or outright opposition from several key euro zone members, including Germany, France and the Netherlands, makes this discussion more complicated.", "description": "Christine Lagarde took a major step towards becoming the European Central Bank's next president on Wednesday, securing the backing of a European Parliament committee after pledging to keep policy loose while undertaking a broader strategy review.", "authors": ["Balazs Koranyi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426222154&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830SZ"}
