It\u2019s a deranging game. It\u2019s dementing our societies and it\u2019s making us do the things we think we\u2019re trying to avoid. In the name of anti-racism, we\u2019re making everything about race. In the name of equality between the sexes we\u2019re going to make men more bitter about women.\u201d\n\nBut it will only end when the Social Justice Warriors embracing identity politics and promoting cancel culture ask themselves one very simple question.\n\nMurray explains:\n\n\u201cA friend of mine was recently speaking at a university in America and mentioned that the class with this visiting lecturer were all asking questions about identity politics matters: things to do with equality, diversity, equity. This person said: \u2018Why are you doing this? You should be trying to work out how we live in underwater cities. You should be working out how we live on the moon. Why are you doing this?\u2019\n\nWhy are they doing this?\n\nGood question.\n\nAnd one to which I bet none of them can come up with a convincing answer.", "description": "Here's a thought to brighten up your weekend: all this identity politics lunacy which has taken hold of our culture has a sell-by date.", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/04/International-Womens-Day-In-Berlin.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
