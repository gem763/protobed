Marco Rubio and Rick Scott said it was an insult to exiles who lived through the Cuban revolution to see their tax money go to aggrandize Guevara.\n\n\u201cGuevara was a sadistic butcher who murdered and tortured innocent people,\u201d they wrote in a letter to NEA Chairwoman Mary Anne Carter. \u201cWe do not believe that taxpayer dollars \u2026 appropriated by Congress to the National Endowment of the Arts should be used to glorify or romanticize an individual who so openly disdained American principles and fundamental rights and freedoms.\u201d\n\nThey were particularly incensed by a description accompanying the exhibit, \u201cPop America 1965-1975,\u201d when it was at a museum in North Carolina saying the goal was to celebrate \u201csocial protest, justice movements and debates about freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis statement is either blithely ignorant or deliberately deceptive, given the exhibition\u2019s inclusion of propaganda celebrating a thug who mercilessly silenced his opponents with bullets,\u201d the senators said.\n\nThe offending portrait is a poster created by Cuban artist Elena Serrano in 1968, based on the iconic 1960 photo of Guevara taken by Alberto Korda. The poster, \u201cDia del Guerrillero Heroico,\u201d or \u201cDay of the Heroic Guerrilla,\u201d shows Korda\u2019s portrait in red in a central rectangle, with an image of South America as an underlay.\n\nGuevara stands in the exhibit alongside Andy Warhol\u2019s 1972 silk-screen portrait of Chinese Communist Chairman Mao Zedong and a host of pop art works by Latino artists. The exhibition won the 2017 Sotheby\u2019s Prize for museums that explore overlooked art themes.\n\nThe NEA earmarked $45,000 for the exhibit and accompanying catalog, with the money going to the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, where the exhibit began last year.\n\nIt then moved to Duke University\u2019s Nasher Museum of Art, which co-sponsored the show.\n\nNeither McNay nor Nasher officials responded to requests for comment Tuesday, but the NEA seemed taken aback by the controversy.\n\nThe agency said nowhere in the project description the NEA used to issue the award is Guevara mentioned.\n\nAnd the statement that irked the two senators about celebrating social protest and justice movements was part of Nasher\u2019s display, but not part of McNay\u2019s \u2014 so it wasn\u2019t funded by the NEA grant, the agency said. Indeed, Nasher\u2019s own website about the exhibit didn\u2019t mention the Guevara portrait.\n\nMore broadly, the NEA said its grants are made based on published guidelines and panels of citizens review every application, with final funding decisions made by an advisory board.\n\nGuevara\u2019s controversial history includes joining Fidel and Raul Castro in overthrowing the Cuban government and installing the communist dictatorship that has dominated the island since 1959. Guevara acted as an executioner for the Castro brothers before taking on other roles in their government.\n\nHis death at the hands of Bolivian authorities in 1967 made him a martyr for communist sympathizers and earned his place on iconic T-shirts worn by college students \u2014 though as Florida\u2019s two senators show, his legacy is far less revered among Cuban exiles who fled oppression under the Castro regime.\n\nThe \u201cPop America\u201d exhibit\u2019s run at the Nasher Museum has ended and the exhibit is now at the Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University in Chicago, where it runs through Dec. 8.\n\nIn a striking twist, the Block Museum has scheduled a film presentation Thursday exploring use of images of Guevara in art and culture.\n\nThe two senators aren\u2019t the first to raise the issue of Guevara\u2019s inclusion in the \u201cPop America\u201d exhibit.\n\nThe Cuban American Bar Association last year chastised Duke University for allowing the display at its art museum. Association President Maria D. Garcia wondered whether the university would have been \u201cthis insensitive\u201d to an exhibit \u201cglorifying a right-wing dictator.\u201d\n\nShe said at a minimum Duke should include a \u201cbalanced, factual, historical perspective\u201d of Guevara, replacing the \u201cone-sided romanticized perspective\u201d given in the \u201cPop America\u201d exhibit.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
