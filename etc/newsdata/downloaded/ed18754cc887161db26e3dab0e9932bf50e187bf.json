The survey polled more than 1,000 Americans ages 22 to 35.\n\nThat overrides other traditional life milestones. A quarter of respondents said buying a home is the most important milestone. Meanwhile, 17% said it's saving for retirement, 15% said starting a family, and 4% said starting to invest.\n\nStudent-loan debt is at an all-time high. The national total student debt is over $1.5 trillion, and the average student loan debt per graduating student in 2018 who took out loans is $29,800, according to Student Loan Hero.\n\nIt's such a burden that it's causing millennials to delay markers of adulthood, like homeownership and starting a family.\n\nRead more: Most millennials and Gen Z define financial success the same way \u2014 and it has nothing to do with being rich\n\nMillennials just want to be debt-free\n\nThe SoFi survey underscores findings from a Merrill Lynch Wealth Management study published earlier this year, which surveyed more than 2,700 Americans ages 18 to 34. That study found that 60% of respondents define financial success as being debt-free.\n\n\"Student debt is having major ripple effects on early adults' futures, financially and personally,\" the report said. \"Four-hundred-thousand early adults who would have purchased a home a decade ago have not been able to afford one due to student debt, and today's early adults take finances into greater consideration in deciding whether and when to have a child than those in past generations.\"\n\nPaying off student-loan debt is so significant that people are celebrating with parties, music videos, and vacations, Business Insider's Allana Akhtar previously reported.\n\n\"It's our like our generation's milestone \u2014 to get rid of the debt we incurred to go to school and try to get good jobs,\" Chelsea McDonnough, who helped pay off her husband's $125,000 student-loan debt, told Akhtar.
