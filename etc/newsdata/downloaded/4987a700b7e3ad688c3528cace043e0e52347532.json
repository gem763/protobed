Be it strolling around the house or toying with nearby items... due to focusing on our chat, we fail to concentrate on what we are doing.\n\nThis means smoking can be an easy option - however you CAN help combat the mindless act by finding a replacement.\n\nStraws, for example, can be used to mimic the act of holding a cigarette while you're having a natter on the phone.\n\nSocial triggers\n\nIf your friends smoke, let them know you're trying to give up so they can help you avoid temptation\n\nWhen your colleague suggests \u201ca quick one after work\u201d or your significant other proposes a date night, smoking may immediately come to mind.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re in the right mindset before you head out. If you can, avoid fellow smokers and steer clear of the smoking area.\n\nOften physical distance is just as, if not more, important than preparing yourself mentally.\n\nBreaks at work\n\nYour daily fag break can turn into a chat with colleagues, a coffee break or a walk in the park\n\nThe second the clock strikes 12, your first thought may be heading out of the office, grabbing a sandwich and enjoying a quick cigarette.\n\nYou can fight the urge however by enjoying a walk, downloading an audiobook and ensuring your mind is off whatever usually leaves you reaching for cigarettes\n\nDriving home\n\nGiving up is all about breaking habits and finding new activities to distract yourself with\n\nOften, a stress buster for smokers is grabbing a pack of cigarettes and having your nicotine fix in the car on your way home.\n\nAgain, break the routine.\n\nBy practising mindfulness and taking the time where you would be smoking to reevaluate your day, you will find an easier path to living a smoke free life\n\nWant to give up smoking?
