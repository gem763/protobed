It is also a shift in the country's position as it had previously ruled out the possibility of striking a deal with Google, with then-Finance Minister Michel Sapin saying that the sums at stake in France were \"far greater\" than those in other European countries.\n\n\"We have now settled tax and related disputes in France that have persisted for many years \u2026 we continue to believe that the best way to provide a clear framework for companies that operate around the world is coordinated reform of the international tax system,\" a Google spokesperson told ZDNet.\n\nIn July, France passed laws to apply a tax on tech giants. The laws require tech companies that make \u20ac750 million globally and \u20ac25 million in France from public advertising and digital intermediary services to consumers to pay a 3% tax of total annual revenues.\n\nThe new tax laws were immediately met with disapproval from US President Donald Trump, who took to Twitter to both complain and promise a retaliation against France.\n\nFrance and the US have since agreed on a compromise, when the country's leaders met at the Group of Seven summit last month.\n\n\"We've done a lot a work on the bilateral basis, we have a deal to overcome the difficulties between us,\" French President Immanuel Macron said at the time.\n\nWhile the 3% tax continues to apply to tech giants, the French government promised it would scrap the tax -- and allow the taxed amounts to be deducted -- once the OECD creates a way to properly tax tech companies in countries where they operate.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTrump promises retaliation for French tech giants tax\n\nSo-called tea-totaling US President also believes US wine is better than French vin.\n\nFrance passes turnover-based tax Bill for tech giants despite US disapproval\n\nTech companies making \u20ac750 million globally and \u20ac25 million in France will have to pay 3% of total annual revenues in tax.\n\nWaymo, Nissan, and Renault team up on driverless cars in France and Japan\n\nThe research into the viability of bringing driverless car services to France and Japan will be conducted in both countries.\n\nGoogle sibling Jigsaw brings anti-troll AI to France ahead of EU elections\n\nFrench news publisher Le Monde is launching a new comments section using Jigsaw's Perspective API.\n\nHow Trump's trade war with China could impact the US tech industry (TechRepublic)\n\nAlex Feinberg, Director of Partnerships at OKcoin, explains why the global trade war could hamper American innovation.", "description": "Wraps up a French investigation into Google's tax activities that started back in 2016.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/13/de1ec75b-d468-4fda-b739-19c1570bfadf/thumbnail/770x578/33fe3d0abedbe94edf1bb83519c81c94/pawel-czerwinski-fpzzev0uqwa-unsplash.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
