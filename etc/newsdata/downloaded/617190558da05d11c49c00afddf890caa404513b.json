Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has slammed GM GM, -1.09% as greedy during a time of what she called record profits, specifically after the auto maker said it would suspend payments for strikers\u2019 health insurance. In the New York Post, conservative economist Steve Malanga sided with the company, incongruously citing 10-year-old earnings reports that have little apparent connection to today\u2019s GM.\n\nThey\u2019re both wrong. But the ambiguity of what\u2019s actually true highlights how challenging it\u2019s going to be to break 40-plus years of wage stagnation, now that at least the Democratic Party at least, prodded by Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow occupants of the party\u2019s leftward flank, is trying to figure out how to do it.\n\nAs I often do, I\u2019ll urge you readers to begin by understanding a few numbers. And GM\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t great.\n\nOcasio-Cortez to the contrary, GM is experiencing nothing like record profits. On one level, its $6.7 billion operating income last year is nothing to sneeze at. But it\u2019s actually down about 36% from $10.6 billion in 2016 \u2014 and the company lost $3.9 billion in net income in 2017, when it had an unusually big tax bill. And the net income line is far from the most challenging part of GM\u2019s financial profile.\n\nThe worst part is the cash flow statement, which shows that GM has had more than $20 billion of negative free cash flow in the last two years. And there is a simple reason for that: The company has spent $25 billion to $27 billion a year since 2015 on capital expenditures \u2014 which aren\u2019t immediately deducted from earnings.\n\nWhy? Simple. To save the company \u2014 and, oh yes, the planet.\n\nThe lion\u2019s share of that money is going into the company\u2019s drive to bring 20 new models of electric vehicles to market by 2023, and to develop self-driving vehicles that may ultimately power GM\u2019s transformation into a company that sells transportation services to people who buy fewer cars, or none at all \u2014 a kind of uber-Uber. With schoolchildren gathering in New York and other cities to protest climate change on Friday, it\u2019s worth remembering that a transition to electric vehicles represents the single biggest change society has to make to keep rising sea levels from flooding coastal cities all over the world, along with myriad other effects.\n\nIt\u2019s also a huge competitive challenge for GM \u2014 one ably chronicled on the cover of this week\u2019s issue of Bloomberg Businessweek. If Tesla TSLA, -2.42% takes control of that market \u2014 as it might have done already with better leadership \u2014 or if GM falls into an also-ran position in a market where more than 250 models of EV are supposed to reach the market by 2022, that\u2019s a fatal threat to GM.\n\nOn top of that, the recession is coming. True, our anticipation of that event is somewhere between waiting (endlessly) for Godot and Meg Ryan\u2019s tearful bewailing of her looming 40th birthday in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally,\u201d the joke of which was that the meltdown came when she was 32. But for narrow-margin, capital-intensive car companies, recessions are no joke. So it isn\u2019t surprising, or greedy, that GM is resisting adding more costs now.\n\nAnd yes \u2014 note to the board \u2014 that same discipline needs to apply to executive pay. CEO Mary Barra made $21.9 million last year, more than half of which was stock and options.\n\nBut if you\u2019re sympathetic to GM\u2019s workers, know that Barra\u2019s pay, while high, isn\u2019t a runaway train \u2014 it was little changed in 2018. Also, the company recently cut thousands of white-collar workers.\n\nOn the other hand, the production workers have a point: They did sacrifice when the company was on the ropes in 2009 and do deserve to claw some of those concessions back now that the company\u2019s condition has normalized.\n\nBack then, the United Auto Workers agreed to let the company pay new assembly-line hires about half of the previous rate ($15 versus $29 per hour), which previous hires kept earning. Those workers would see their pay rise to the level of more-tenured workers after eight years with the company.\n\nThe union wants the introductory wage boosted now, and for the catch-up period for those who stick with the job to be reduced to four years. And it resists management\u2019s efforts to shift more health-insurance premiums onto workers \u2014 a goal workers throughout America might sympathize with, since thousands of nonunionized companies have been passing health-insurance inflation onto their staff for years.\n\nThe parties will end up working these issues out \u2014 and they should, because each side has a point. I\u2019d bet that the UAW gets less than it wants, but gets something on the two-wage-scale issue and mostly, if not entirely, prevails on health insurance.\n\nThe lesson to the rest of us is to let the process work, with a minimum of name-calling on either side.\n\nDemocrats, as a party, want to help unions become more powerful again, hoping that collective bargaining will help undo the concentrations of wealth that technology, globalization and tax policy have wrought.\n\nRepublicans came to power in 2016 on a wave of race-baiting and demonization of brown people that has plagued their party in both election years since, and promises to do the same next year and beyond. Democrats would do well not to let the same type of oversimplification and vilification \u2014 just with different villains \u2014 become the central selling point of their politics.\n\nAs GM\u2019s story shows, sometimes there actually is legitimate competition to claim the dollars that workers would like to get.", "description": "Liberals cry corporate greed, but GM\u2019s cash is going toward the biggest liberal goal of all.", "authors": ["Tim Mullaney"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR761_gm_str_ZG_20190920114950.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
