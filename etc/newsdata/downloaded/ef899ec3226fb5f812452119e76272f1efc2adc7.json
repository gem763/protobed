But according to Reuters, David Marcus, the executive leading Facebook's blockchain initiative, told a banking seminar that he was open to looking at alternative approaches.\n\n\"We could do it differently,\" he said, according to the news agency. \"Instead of having a synthetic unit \u2026 we could have a series of stablecoins, a dollar stablecoin, a euro stablecoin, a sterling pound stablecoin, etc.\"\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are usually pegged to government-backed currencies like the dollar. Tether is the world's best-known stablecoin, backed by the dollar, though it has garnered some controversy over whether it has a sufficient amount of dollars in reserve, as well as the suggestion that it could have been used for market manipulation.\n\nSuch currencies aim to reduce the volatility seen in virtual currencies like bitcoin and ether. In libra's case, the objective is to create a more efficient cross-border payments system.", "description": "Facebook's David Marcus says Libra could use \"a series of stablecoins\" pegged to currencies like the dollar, the euro and sterling.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106027276-1563479286361gettyimages-1156127761.jpeg?v=1571643291", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
