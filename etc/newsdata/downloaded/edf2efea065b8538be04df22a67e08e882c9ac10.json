Some say he is a bogey man; tall, thin, faceless, and wearing a non-descript suit - very similar to the way the \u2018men in black\u2019 reputedly\n\nvisit to quash rumours of aliens.\u201d\n\nMs Chainey insisted there was \u201cstill hope\u201d though with folklore seeing a resurgence as many attempt to unearth old tales, efforts she said were common in times of turmoil and unrest, when people look to the past for stability and comfort.\n\n\u201cMany of the old fairy tales are now being rewritten and retold in new ways: with new heroes, heroines, and new lessons that are relevant to the modern day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what folklore is about: taking the old wisdom and traditions, and redefining them for who we are, and the lives we now have.\u201d\n\nThe public can share their folk wisdom online via the National Trust online.\n\nTales of local folklore\n\nIn Somerset, the seventh child of a seventh child is said to have special healing powers of touch, usually attributed only to kings.\n\nIn Digby, Lincs, it was believed well into the twentieth century that once you have seen a white dog, you should not speak until you then see a white horse\n\nIn Gloucestershire, it was believed mushrooms did not grow after they had been seen and rosemary only grew at a house ruled by a woman.\n\nThe Diamond Stone at Avebury, Wilts, is said to cross the road when the clock strikes 12.\n\nIn Northamptonshire it was said that bees could not thrive if living within an argumentative household and no one should never swear in front of a hive\n\nIt was said to be impossible for someone to die on a mattress or pillow containing pigeon feathers in both Cumbria and Northumberland\n\nTo begin anything on a Friday, from a journey to a business deal, was deemed bad luck in Devon", "description": "Mythical tales about mermaids, warriors and hidden treasure, walnuts to cure brain disease, dead beetles causing rain.", "authors": ["Victoria Ward", "Nick Timothy", "Sara Khan", "Tim Stanley"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212170836-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZ_JcPYgesQnahAq0MEErmUtFcEGo2u39IGeve0n32Zs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
