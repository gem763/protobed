community.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the war, more than 1,000 bunkers had been built in Hamburg alone, more than any other German city, according to the city\u2019s tourism website. Today, about 650 still stand.\n\nThe St Pauli structure is one of the largest. Designed to hold 18,000 people, it has extra-wide entrances so mothers could push children through in strollers.\n\nThe imposing castle-like structure, 246 feet wide and 115 feet high, is also called \u201cHochbunker,\u201d which translates to \u201chigh bunker.\u201d\n\nDuring heavy bombing during the summer of 1943, at least 25,000 Germans sought shelter there.\n\nAfter the war, discussions to destroy the structure ended when it became clear that the amount of dynamite needed to bring its thick walls down would blow the residential area around it to smithereens.\n\nThe space was used as a television broadcasting hub in the 1950s and, more recently, as a work space for musicians and artists and a venue hosting live concerts and nightclubs.\n\nIt is not the first Nazi-era site to catch the eye of a private developer in Germany.\n\nIn 2018, in the former Gestapo headquarters in Hamburg, where Jews, gay people, Roma and other people targeted by the Nazis were tortured and murdered, a cluster of high-end apartments, luxury boutiques and offices opened for business. Protests ensued.\n\nA never-completed holiday resort that Hitler had intended to be used for workers through his \u201cStrength Through Joy\u201d project has been converted to luxury apartments. The massive complex, originally known as the Colossus of Prora, stretches for miles along the island of Rugen off Germany\u2019s Baltic coast. Recent guests gave the accommodations an 8.4 rating on Booking.com.\n\nThe challenge when integrating these sites into modern-day landscapes is \u201chow to reconcile commemoration and consumption or consumerism,\u201d said Thomas L Doughton, a senior lecturer at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts who takes students on tours of Holocaust sites across Europe to explore the politics of memory.\n\nMr Doughton said there were parallels to places in the United States, including plantations where African Americans were once enslaved and the sites of atrocities against Native Americans, that have been commercialised at the expense of a blunt reckoning with historical oppression. Some of these places\u2019 paying customers are descendants exploring their heritage.\n\nOther travellers, he said, are drawn to the \u201cpornographic\u201d aspect of violence. \u201cDark tourism,\u201d as the growing trade is known, involves profiting from places that were once sites of shame and horror, contributing to what Mr Doughton calls the \u201cgentrification of terror.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of the concern with some people in Hamburg, as well as in other locations in Europe and elsewhere,\u201d he said, is \u201cthat the real significance of some of these sites will become lost.\u201d\n\nTobias Helbing is part of a volunteer group in Hamburg that is organising the rooftop garden, known as the Hilldegarden, for which 4,700 shrubs, plants and trees are growing in wait to be hoisted atop the bunker.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to move on,\u201d Mr Helbing said, but \u201cvery respectfully.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the garden, which will be open to the public, the group is creating a 560-square-foot exhibition space to commemorate the structure\u2019s past.\n\nThey are collecting artefacts and interviewing locals who were protected by the bunker, as well as tracking down the people who were forced to built it, about whom little is known.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hide the history,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make it more visible and more transparent.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "A former Nazi bunker in Hamburg, Germany, built by forced labourers to shelter tens of thousands of Germans during Allied air raids in the Second World War, will soon house hotel guests.", "authors": ["Emily S Rueb"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/09/st-pauli-nh-hotel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
