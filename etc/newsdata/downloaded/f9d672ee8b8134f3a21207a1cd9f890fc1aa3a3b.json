I understand the NBA. The players and the owners both got billions of dollars at stake.\u201d\n\nBarkley also slammed the \u201cidiots and jackasses and fools\u201d criticizing the NBA and reiterated his point about the cash saying, \u201cThe NBA makes billions of dollars in China and that goes to the owners and the players. So, it\u2019s a business decision, and I totally understand it.\u201d\n\nObviously, Barkley is thrilled when players attack Americans for not toeing the progressive line despite the costs to the bottom line, but when it comes time to criticizing the very real human rights abuses in China, Barkley thinks the money should dictate free speech.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Former NBA star Charles Barkley has come out against the \"idiots\" criticizing the NBA over the China controversy, and defended the league", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/getty-1-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
