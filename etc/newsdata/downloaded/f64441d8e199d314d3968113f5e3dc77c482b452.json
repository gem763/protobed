He named his start-up Thunder Beast, a term for bison among Plains Indians, who made a sassafras drink that was a precursor to root beer. Norberg developed more root beer flavors as well as a cream soda, and started selling his drinks in Harris Teeter and other stores in four states and the District.\n\nBut this quirky, entrepreneurial story took a bizarre and nightmarish turn in early 2016 when Thunder Beast landed in the crosshairs of Monster Beverage Corp., an energy drink manufacturer worth $32 billion that claims to make \u201cthe meanest energy drink on the planet,\u201d geared to \u201cathletes, musicians, anarchists, coeds, road warriors, metal heads, geeks, hipsters, and bikers.\u201d It\u2019s also known in the intellectual property trade press as the world\u2019s biggest \u201ctrademark bully,\u201d which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) defines as \u201ca trademark owner that uses its trademark rights to harass and intimidate another business beyond what the law might be reasonably interpreted to allow.\u201d\n\nMonster Energy Co., a subsidiary of Monster Beverage, has a trademark for \u201cMonster Energy,\u201d its core line of drinks; for its slogan \u201cUnleash the beast\u201d; and for its logo of a letter \u201cm\u201d drawn with a claw. The company petitioned the USPTO to cancel Norberg\u2019s trademark registration for Thunder Beast, arguing that its name is too similar to Monster\u2019s slogan and would confuse consumers.\n\nIn protest, Thunder Beast started using the phrase \u201cFight monsters\u201d on its website and on its bottles. Norberg also retained Eve Brown, a Boston attorney who has represented eight other businesses targeted by Monster. Her first client was MonsterFishKeepers, a group for fish hobbyists that Monster Energy said used a logo that looked too similar to its claw mark. MonsterFishKeepers was able to keep its name but lost the right to its logo. Her other clients include Brad Eastman, who used his first initial and last name \u2014 Beastman \u2014 as a name for his tea company, and B-52s lead singer Fred Schneider, who has marketed coffee called Monster Blend. Those cases are pending. In total, Monster has initiated over 1,000 trademark cases that have either gone to court or been reviewed by USPTO\u2019s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, according to the agency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMonster Energy\u2019s lawyers did not return phone and email requests for comment about the Thunder Beast case. But Lynda Zadra-Symes, a partner with its longtime law firm, Knobbe Martens, said in a 2018 case against a Florida company selling Monster Mobile auto tools: \u201cMonster\u2019s strong intellectual property rights transcend energy drinks and are enforceable against a broad spectrum of goods.\u201d\n\nMonster Energy doesn\u2019t always win. It unsuccessfully went after the NBA\u2019s Toronto Raptors for using a clawed-up basketball as its logo, and Disney for its 2013 film \u201cMonsters University.\u201d But the company frequently still gets what it wants. The cost of litigation was too much for Justin Drazin, author of \u201cAlbert and the Amazing Pillow Monsters,\u201d an illustrated book for kids ages 3 to 8, intended to allay fears of the dark. \u201cI had to bow to their demands,\u201d Drazin told me. \u201cI had written a second and third book in the series, but they were never published because of the Monster debacle.\u201d Monster had argued his book\u2019s title was too similar to the drink company\u2019s name.\n\nMonster is not alone in its zealous approach to trademark protection. Apple Inc. has claimed trademark infringement by a sandwich shop, an Ohio accounting business and a pencil maker. Trademark bullying is pervasive enough that, in 2010, President Barack Obama signed legislation mandating a Commerce Department study of the practice. But the resulting report, which cited Monster\u2019s unsuccessful claim against a Vermont brewery, failed to come up with meaningful recommendations, and \u201cnot much has been done since the report was issued,\u201d says Victoria Phillips, co-founder of an intellectual-property law clinic at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law. \u201cTrademark enforcement is important to protect businesses,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s only when there\u2019s overreach by companies that it becomes a problem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor Norberg, his battle with Monster is far from over. Last year, just before the trademark office was expected to rule on Monster\u2019s case against Thunder Beast, Monster withdrew its petition and filed a separate lawsuit against Thunder Beast in California for alleged \u201cfraudulent and malicious\u201d conduct that it claimed resulted in \u201cirreparable injury.\u201d In its complaint, Monster argues that Norberg intentionally tried to mislead the public and that the phrase \u201cFight monsters\u201d is also trademark infringement; the company is demanding not-yet-specified monetary damages.\n\nAt an August hearing in the case in Los Angeles, U.S. District Judge Andr\u00e9 Birotte Jr. told Monster\u2019s attorney: \u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019re here, other than you\u2019re trying to crush this root beer company out of business.\u201d Birotte had sent the case to mediation in May, but the two sides remained far apart. He sent them back for a second round of mediation in October. Norberg expects that to fail, and a trial is scheduled for January.\n\nFor Monster, all this legal wrangling may just be the cost of doing business. But for the soft-spoken Norberg, it has had a much darker, more personal effect. \u201cI expected the legal battle to be challenging, but nothing really prepared me for it,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ve taken out loans and sold equipment. Money I would have invested in product development and marketing has been spent to defend myself. My marriage has been overshadowed by this desperate struggle. On a bad day, this feels crushing and hopeless.\u201d So far, he has spent $65,000 on legal bills, more than his profits from the past three years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNonetheless, Norberg is philosophical. \u201cTrademark bullying is part of a much larger problem in our culture,\u201d he says. \u201cBullying happens whenever someone with power decides that they can take something from someone they deem weaker than themselves. So, I really want my legal battle to count for something, and I hope I can join others to be part of a larger discussion about flaws in our current legal system and how we can help small businesses who are being bullied.\u201d\n\nAndrew L.
