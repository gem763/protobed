He had no idea it was stuck deep in his nose until doctors removed it, which is when he remembered trying to hide the drug in his nose\n\nDoctors in Australia conducted a CT scan of his brain, after he complained of headaches \u2013 a common symptom of a rhinolith.\n\nIt showed a 1.9cm x 1.1cm grey lesion in his right nasal cavity and he was referred to the ear, nose and throat department at Sydney's Westmead Hospital.\n\nWhen questioned, he admitted to having had a 'long history' of getting a blocked nose and sinus infections \u2013 two other common rhinolith signs.\n\nDoctors removed the man's foreign body, which they noted was a 'rubber capsule containing degenerate vegetable or plant matter'.\n\nWriting in the British Medical Journal Case Reports, medics revealed they found out it was cannabis after quizzing the patient. It is unclear what they did with the drug.\n\nWHAT IS A RHINOLITH? Rhinoliths are rare, accounting for one in 10,000 patients who are treated at an ear, nose and throat unit, figures suggest. The unusual masses slowly develop when deposits of calcium and mucus build up over a foreign object, including beads, buttons and even teeth. Symptoms include headaches \u2013 the symptom the man sought help for, as well as nasal obstruction, discharge and even facial pain. The team who treated this patient said: 'To the best of our knowledge, our case represents the first report of a prison-acquired marijuana-based rhinolith.' Medics, led by Dr Eugene Wong, added this is likely because most drug smuggling attempts involve the substance being ingested.\n\nThey wrote: 'On follow-up and specific questioning, the patient was able to recall an incident that occurred 18 years prior, while he was incarcerated.\n\n'During a prison visit, the patient's girlfriend supplied him with a small quantity of marijuana, inside a rubber balloon.\n\n'In order to evade detection, the patient inserted the package inside his right nostril.\n\n'Despite effectively smuggling the package past the prison guards, the patient then accidentally pushed the package deeper into his nostril and mistakenly believed he had swallowed it.\n\n'He remained unaware of the package's presence until presented with the unusual histopathology report.'\n\nThe man reported 'complete resolution' of symptoms three months after the surgery.\n\nThe team added: 'To the best of our knowledge, our case represents the first report of a prison-acquired marijuana-based rhinolith.'\n\nMedics, led by Dr Eugene Wong, added this is likely because most drug smuggling attempts involve the substance being ingested.\n\nRhinoliths are rare, accounting for one in 10,000 patients who are treated at an ear, nose and throat unit, figures suggest.\n\nThe unusual masses slowly develop when deposits of calcium and mucus build up over a foreign object, including beads, buttons and even teeth.\n\nSymptoms include headaches \u2013 the symptom the man sought help for, as well as nasal obstruction, discharge and even facial pain.", "description": "The unidentified 48-year-old, from Sydney, assumed he had accidentally swallowed the package, which was given to him by his girlfriend during a prison visit.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/20276134-0-image-a-2_1572261655500.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
