Antara Foto/Sigid Kurniawan/ via REUTERS\n\nBringing on board Prabowo, who was Widodo\u2019s challenger in April\u2019s bitterly fought election, means the president can further strengthen his grip on parliament as he seeks to push through his reform agenda. The retired general\u2019s Gerindra party has the third most seats in the lower house.\n\nThe make-up of the cabinet was being closely watched to see how many technocrats - who are more likely to fall in with Widodo\u2019s plans for boosting growth and investment - were included.\n\nWidodo had been expected to announce his full cabinet line-up on Monday, but this had been delayed until Wednesday, officials said.\n\n\u201cI want appointed ministers to be figures who are innovative, productive, as well as be hard and fast workers. Figures who are not stuck in monotonous routines,\u201d Widodo said in a Twitter message.\n\nA series of candidates visiting the presidential palace on Monday said Widodo had asked them to join the cabinet, but they declined to confirm the positions offered.\n\nPrabowo, 68, said after meeting the president he had been asked to help in the defence sector. Media reports have suggested he would serve as defence minister.\n\nHis cabinet inclusion comes after he had initially refused to concede defeat in April\u2019s vote, going to the constitutional court citing systematic fraud and abuse of power.\n\nBut after the court ruled against him the former special forces commander met Widodo on a number of occasions, including during a well-publicised ride on Jakarta\u2019s new subway system.\n\nIndonesian political parties tend to be divided more by the rival personalities at the helm rather than ideology, meaning they can more easily switch allegiances to get into power.\n\nGOJEK CEO\n\nNadiem Makarim, 35, the chief executive of Indonesian ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek, was another visitor at the palace.\n\n\u201cI have received a big honour to be able to join the cabinet of the president,\u201d Makarim told reporters.\n\nHe has been linked to a possible post in a new digital economy ministry or in education. Gojek said the company\u2019s president Andre Soelistyo and its co-founder Kevin Aluwi would take over the leadership of the $10 billion unicorn.\n\nWidodo\u2019s election campaign manager Erick Thohir, 49, the chairman of media business Mahaka Media (ABBA.JK) was also interviewed for a post, sending shares in his company up 19%.\n\nThohir, a former chairman of Italian soccer club Inter Milan who also has stakes in basketball teams, successfully led the team organising the Asian Games hosted by Indonesia last year.\n\nThe billionaire businessman said he would step down from his company if appointed, noting the president had asked candidates to sign \u201can integrity pact\u201d to avoid conflict of interests.\n\nLOBBYING FOR POSTS\n\nWidodo has been besieged by \u201cextremely intense\u201d jockeying for posts as he sought to build a cabinet of technocrat ministers, a presidential adviser has said, declining to be named.\n\nWhile analysts welcomed some of the private sector picks, Arya Fernandes at the Jakarta-based Center for Strategic and International Studies cautioned that too many political appointments could undermine the cabinet\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nOn Sunday, Widodo said around 16 ministers in the new cabinet would come from parties out of an anticipated 34 posts.\n\nWidodo, 58, has pledged to cut red tape and keep building infrastructure to underpin growth in Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy, but also made improving education a top priority to encourage investment and create jobs for a youthful population of 260 million people.\n\nAirlangga Hartarto, the current industry minister and chairman of political party Golkar, was among a string of potential candidates meeting the president at the palace.\n\nHe said he had discussed how to narrow Indonesia\u2019s trade deficit, without elaborating on any role. He has been linked in media to the job of coordinating minister for economic affairs.\n\nWidodo has previously said respected finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati would retain a position in the cabinet, but gave no further details.", "description": "Indonesian President Joko Widodo asked opposition leader Prabowo Subianto on Monday to join his new cabinet for a second term, while the co-founder of tech start-up Gojek and a former chairman of Inter Milan soccer club were also tapped for posts.", "authors": ["Maikel Jefriando", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443222969&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K08T", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
