Neither of them said it \u2014 that Biden is too old \u2014 but they might as well have.\n\nCastro at one point (wrongly) accused Biden of forgetting something he had just said on the debate stage, animatedly repeating, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\"\n\nThen Booker appeared on CNN after the debate and had this to say:\n\nBOOKER: I think that we are at a tough point right now, because there\u2019s a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling. And I think that Castro had some really legitimate concerns about, can he be someone in a long grueling campaign that can get the ball over the line, and has every right to call out. ... Q: Do you think that Biden did a better job tonight? Do you think that he showed that he could take the ball over the line? People are saying, look, he was stronger. BOOKER: I think there were a lot of moments where a number of us were looking on the stage when he tends to go on sometimes. At one point, he was talking about communities like mine listening to record players. I don\u2019t remember the last time I saw a record player. ... But there are definitely moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder. But I don\u2019t know -- Q: Senator, are you saying that he\u2019s just too old to be president? BOOKER: No, I\u2019m definitely not saying that, because I\u2019ve listened to Joe Biden over the years and often felt like there were times that he is going on or meandering in his speech. Look, I want someone that can excite and energize and call us to a campaign like we saw back in \u201908, in \u201912 where we saw record turnouts and somebody who can speak to the fullness of the Democratic Party. If I believed Joe Biden was that person, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here.\n\nSen. Cory Booker on Juli\u00e1n Castro's jab at former VP Joe Biden's memory: \"Castro has some really legitimate concerns about, can he be someone in a long grueling campaign that can get the ball over the line? And he has every right to call that out.\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rRxWIV0FmL \u2014 CNN (@CNN) September 13, 2019\n\nWe can debate all day whether these are veiled or not-so-veiled attacks on Biden\u2019s age (Castro claimed after the debate he was just engaging on policy). But that\u2019s kind of beside the point. Two of the candidates on the debate stage Thursday night accused the candidate who leads almost every Democratic primary poll of lacking both mental and verbal acuity. Doing so certainly highlights Biden\u2019s age, which is an unavoidable topic given he would by far be our oldest president and certainly has had his share of flubs and senior moments. Even if that wasn\u2019t the intent, the effect would be similar: It calls into question his fitness to be president.\n\nThere are many things that can be papered over in a general election, as we saw in 2016 when Republican presidential candidates called Donald Trump all manner of things from \u201ccrazy\u201d to \u201cbigoted\u201d to \u201cnuts\u201d to \u201csniveling coward\u201d to \u201cdangerous.\u201d We\u2019ve written repeatedly about how ridiculous it is for Republicans to say these things and then pretend like they didn\u2019t really mean them and/or that it was just par-for-the-course campaign rhetoric. It went far beyond that.\n\nBut were Biden to become the Democratic nominee, this is the kind of primary attack that could be difficult to shake. How do Democrats argue that a man who would be 78 years old upon his inauguration in 2021 and who they said lacked acuity during the campaign would be a steady leader for the country? It\u2019s easier to dismiss \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d as overheated campaign rhetoric; what about the argument that Biden just isn\u2019t sharp? You\u2019re then going to tell people to trust him to engage in high-stakes diplomacy with foreign leaders and make life-or-death decisions?\n\nDemocrats will dismiss this by pointing to the man in the White House. They have long suggested there are signs of deterioration with Trump, who is also in his 70s. Trump\u2019s speech certainly meanders, and he either doesn\u2019t process basic facts or doesn\u2019t care about misstating them. They\u2019ll argue it\u2019s unfair to focus on Biden\u2019s flubs when Trump has so many of his own.\n\nBut the more they suggest Biden may not be a steady leader capable of \u201ccarrying the ball across the line\u201d in the campaign, the more difficult it will be to draw that contrast with Trump. Democratic Party leaders have to be scared about the direction in which this is going.", "description": "There are certain attacks you can explain away in the general election.
