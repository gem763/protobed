Adam Scott/Prime Minister's Office/Handout via REUTERS.\n\n\u201cI was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President,\u201d Obama said in a tweet. \u201cHe\u2019s a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.\u201d\n\nThe two progressive leaders formed a close friendship that has remained a popular topic on social media since Obama, a Democrat, left the White House in January 2017. They were spotted having dinner together at an Ottawa restaurant earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThanks my friend,\u201d Trudeau responded on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to keep our progress going.\u201d\n\nTrudeau was the first Canadian prime minister the United States honored with a state dinner in almost two decades when Obama invited him and his wife to Washington in March 2016 after Trudeau won power the previous October.\n\nTrudeau has had a rockier relationship with Obama\u2019s Republican successor, Donald Trump.\n\nOpinion polls strongly suggest Trudeau will lose his parliamentary majority in Monday\u2019s election. nL2N27113J]\n\nIt is not the first time Obama has endorsed a foreign leader. He tweeted his support for Emmanuel Macron ahead of France\u2019s 2017 presidential election.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Ottawa declined to comment on the endorsement on the grounds that Obama is a private citizen.\n\nThe Conservatives and left-leaning New Democrats - the two main opposition parties contesting the election - did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nElections Canada, the country\u2019s nonpartisan elections administrator, said Obama\u2019s tweet did not contravene regulations on foreign interference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s free speech. The only issue would be if Mr. Obama started to spend money on Mr. Trudeau\u2019s campaign,\u201d spokesman Pierre Cadieux said by phone.\n\n\u201cA foreign citizen tweeting, or speaking at an event organized in Canada, does not by itself constitute an instance of undue foreign influence,\u201d he later clarified by email. \u201cWhether expenses were incurred, who incurred them and for what reason would be among the factors that need to be considered before determining if undue foreign influence has taken place.\u201d", "description": "Former U.S. President Barack Obama voiced his support on Wednesday for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who faces a tough battle for re-election next week.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441628181&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1SS", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
