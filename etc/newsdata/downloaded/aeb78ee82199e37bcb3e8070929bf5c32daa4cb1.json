Four female pilots discuss life on the flightdeck 1/4 Jessica Sundquist: 787 Dreamliner captain at Norwegian Jessica Sundquist, a Swedish 787 Dreamliner captain for Norwegian, has spoken extensively about being a woman in the industry. In the past she\u2019s spoken about the concept of \u201cputting your femininity aside\u201d in order to succeed. Sundquist says today that she felt she \u201cdidn\u2019t have to do it\u201d, but also wanted to fit into the industry \u201cwithout being known as \u2018the girl\u2019\u201d. Today, times are changing, she says, and more women are joining the industry \u2013 but it\u2019s not all good news. \u201cDespite working hard to get to where I am today as a captain at one of the most modern and exciting airlines, the industry still has a lot more work to do to give women more opportunities,\u201d she says In the future, she\u2019d like the discussion on gender inequality to remain \u201copen and ongoing\u201d, but argues that real action also needs to take place to make any difference. Norwegian 2/4 Joanna Riggs: A380 first officer at British Airways First officer Joanna Riggs says she was never \u201cparticularly exposed to aviation as a career choice\u201d, but became a BA cabin crew member after university in order to see more of the world. She says that entering such a highly male-dominated profession wasn\u2019t daunting, but that she felt \u201clucky to have two other females\u201d on her course. Colleagues have always been supportive in Riggs\u2019 experience as have \u2013 for the most part \u2013 passengers, though some are \u201csurprised\u201d when they see a female pilot. \u201cI hope it will one day be normal to everyone,\u201d she adds. Some passengers give a \u201cthumbs up or a girl power sign\u201d. As for gender differences on the flight deck, Riggs says, \u201cWe are very professional on the flight deck so it doesn\u2019t matter what the gender, race or sexuality of my colleague is. \u201cFlying with a fellow female is always a treat though. My brother is also a British Airways pilot, and although I haven\u2019t flown with him, I get the feeling we would be very similar. British Airways 3/4 Lucy Tardrew: Boeing 747 captain at Virgin Atlantic Lucy Tardrew had always wanted to join the RAF, she says, but it was never allowed to happen \u2013 because \u201dthey weren\u2019t taking girls at the time\u201d. Instead, she travelled to America, where she trained before becoming a flying instructor. After returning to the UK and converting her licences, she began flying night mail \u2013 \u201cliterally all the posts around the country at night\u201d \u2013 before stints flying executive jets, and last-minute jobs including air ambulances and freighting transplant organs, before joining Virgin 23 years ago. Tardrew is enthusiastic about the company, but is saddened that the ratio of women in the industry as a whole remains low. As for challenges in the workplace, she\u2019s never experienced any discrimination. Noting the rare pay equality in the piloting industry, Tardrew feels the reason there aren\u2019t more female pilots is down to the fact that \u201dthere aren\u2019t enough female role models for schoolchildren to think, \u2018I\u2019m going to become an airline pilot\u2019.\u201d Virgin Atlantic 4/4 Kate McWilliams: captain at easyJet At 26, Kate McWilliams became the youngest commercial captain in the world. \u201cI love being a captain for easyJet,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy to be working for an airline that is working hard to increase the number of female pilots.\u201d Flying was always her goal \u2013 but she didn\u2019t realise how far she could take it. \u201cI joined the air cadets at 13-years-old, but it wasn\u2019t until much later that I realised I could become a commercial pilot,\u201d she says. \u201cEasyJet is aiming to inspire young women, with the Amy Johnson Flying Initiative and their sponsorship of the Brownies, giving girls aged seven to 10 the opportunity to earn an Aviation Badge. The work it\u2019s doing is really important.\u201d The Amy Johnson Flying Initiative was launched in October 2015 with the aim of doubling the number of female new entrant pilots, to 12 per cent, over a two-year period. After achieving its aim in the first year, the airline set a target of 20 per cent for new entrant cadet pilots in 2020. easyJet 1/4 Jessica Sundquist: 787 Dreamliner captain at Norwegian Jessica Sundquist, a Swedish 787 Dreamliner captain for Norwegian, has spoken extensively about being a woman in the industry.
