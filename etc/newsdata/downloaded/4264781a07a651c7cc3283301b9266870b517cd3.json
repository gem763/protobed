New projections showed policymakers at the median expected\n\nrates to stay within the new range through 2020, bad news for\n\ninvestors hoping for additional cuts to help blunt global\n\neconomic fallout from the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nStocks sold off immediately after the Fed's announcement but\n\nrebounded during Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference. He\n\ntold reporters the Fed was prepared to be \"aggressive\" if\n\nnecessary.\n\n\"He did a very good job conveying the view that this was a\n\nmid-cycle adjustment, but that obviously the Fed is ready to act\n\nif it needs to do more,\" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market\n\nstrategist at JonesTrading.\n\nThe late-session rebound could be partly the result of short\n\nsellers covering their positions after the earlier dip, O'Rourke\n\nsaid.\n\nOf the stock bounce, Cherry Lane Investments partner Rick\n\nMeckler said, \"The bottom line is (Powell) didn't say anything\n\nthat negative.
