I mean, it's physically wearing but you're not really getting hurt. If you if you're getting hurt, someone's not doing their job right.\u201d\n\nSmulders, 37, whose husband comedian and actor Taran Killam, 37, is a series regular on fellow ABC show \u201cSingle Parents,\u201d said she was even more drawn to Dex because of her willingness to fearlessly say what\u2019s on her mind.\n\nCOBIE SMULDERS EXPLAINS WHY SHE POSED TOPLESS\n\n\u201cI just like her. I like the way that she rolls with however she's feeling, you know,\u201d Smulders explained. \u201cI like playing sort of a sexually ambiguous woman on network television. I like that she's sort of her own boss. I like that she just doesn't really have \u2013 there are no rules for her. So that excited me.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d alum continued: \u201cWe're still trying to figure out the tone of this right because there is a certain, you know, P.I. way of talking, you know. Kind of like this sassy one-liner, which I don't think kind of \u2013 it doesn't fit quite right but there is a moment and a place for it or to take that rhythm and modernize it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it's usually her humor is coming situationally. But I think that there will be opportunities. For there's a lot of physical comedy but then also just really funny lines,\u201d she added.\n\nBut for Smulders \u2013 it was the quality of life she sought and, in becoming an executive producer on the graphic-novel-adapted series, Smulders is happy that she can spend more time with her family.\n\nCOBIE SMULDERS SHARES HER STAY-FIT TRICKS\n\n\"First of all, it's such a blessing I was on 'How I Met Your Mother' for so long and that's shot in Los Angeles and I was allowed to have a life in the city,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I've been off of it for five years now and traveling so much, I just feel that it takes a hit to a family. But it's so nice \u2013 there are going to be really long hours and it's going to be really physically draining but I get to go and sleep in my own bed and my child will probably come at 6 a.m. into that bed.\u201d\n\nSmulders told reporters she looks forward to her daughters Shaelyn, 10, and Janita, 4, being able to witness their mother in her element and even said she\u2019s teaching them how to perform stunts of their own just in case the rough-housing gets a little out of hand.\n\n\u201cThere are certainly sacrifices, but also it excites me I have two girls and it's exciting for them to see their mother having a career and having dreams and fulfilling goals,\" she said. \"That's what I tell myself anyways to sleep at night. You do your best and I'm a very hands-on parent and everybody who's involved in this project knows that and has been extremely accommodating thus far.\"\n\nWhen asked how her daughters usually react to seeing their mother fake being battered and bruised after an intense fight scene, Smulders added: \u201cI walk them through how to do stunts, how to make it look real but it's not really.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cQuite honestly, they don't watch a lot of television,\u201d she continued. \u201cI don't think they've seen an episode of 'How I Met Your Mother' or anything from the 'Avengers.' They're still really little and they don't see that on me in person. So I try to explain sort of the choreography involved and that actually is kind of \u2013 like it's funny to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cStumptown,\u201d which also stars Michael Ealy as Det.
