Andrew Cuomo called on New Yorkers Monday to avoid using e-cigarettes after hundreds across the country were hospitalized with mysterious health emergencies linked to vaping.\n\nAppearing in front of signs that said \u201cVaping can expose you to toxic chemicals and kill you!\u201d Mr. Cuomo said they would be instituting tougher regulations on e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cThis is a frightening public health phenomenon,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cCommon sense says that if you don\u2019t know what you are smoking \u2014 don\u2019t smoke it.\u201d\n\nNew York will require stores selling vaping devices to post signs identical to the ones the New York Democrat was standing with.\n\nThe state\u2019s Health Department has also opened up investigations into three vape companies which added marijuana ingredients like THC to their devices, which is illegal in New York.\n\nMr. Cuomo has also called for the ban of flavored products, which experts attribute as appealing to younger users.\n\nMultiple lawsuits have been filed and House Democrats have launched an investigation into the e-cigarette epidemic as the Centers for Disease Control says they are investigating 450 vaping related cases, including four deaths.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has also gone after the company Juul Labs for illegally marketing to minors and telling them it was \u201csafe\u201d to use.\n\nJuul CEO Kevin Burns said in August the product was never intended to be used by underaged customers and apologized to parents whose children have gotten addicted.\n\nHe also issued a blunt warning for non-smokers, urging them to not use their product as the e-cigarette maker faces federal investigations and multiple lawsuits.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t vape. Don\u2019t use Juul,\u201d Mr. Burns said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.", "description": "Gov.
