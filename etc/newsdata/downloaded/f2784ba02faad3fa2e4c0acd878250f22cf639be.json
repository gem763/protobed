But she has won 31 of 35 matches this season including 13 of 16 three-setters, roaring to the prestigious Indian Wells title in March, becoming the first Canadian in 5o years to win the Rogers Cup last month in Toronto and climbing to No 15 in the rankings.\n\nNow she is the first teen to play this far into the US Open since Caroline Wozniacki\u2019s run to the 2009 final and only the third Canadian woman in the tournament\u2019s 139-year history to reach the semi-finals after Lois Moyes in 1909 and Carling Bassett in 1984. Not even this precocious only child of Romanian immigrants, it seems, could have visualized that.\n\n\u201cIs this real life?\u201d the 15th-seeded Andreescu said after her tour-high 29th win on hard courts this season. \u201cA year ago I was in the [US Open] qualifying round. I remember I was suffering from a back injury. Now what I\u2019ve accomplished this year, I\u2019m honestly speechless. I need someone to pinch me right now.\u201d\n\nThe 25th-seeded Bertens, who had cruised into the quarter-finals without allowing more than three games in a set, was locked in from the jump and broke Andreescu in the fourth game of the opener before serving out the set in drama-free fashion as the Canadian struggled to suss out her timing.\n\nBut Andreescu, the first Canadian man or woman to play a US Open quarter-final since Patricia Hy-Boulais in 1992, showed the steely composure and taste for the fight that\u2019s buoyed her through so many marathon matches all season, finding her range with the forehand, pinning the Belgian counter-puncher back with powerful groundstrokes belying her 5ft 7in frame and mixing in drop shots to keep her off balance. She broke Bertens twice in the second to force a third, then improved her first-serve percentage to 73% in the decider right when it seemed the conditions were wearing her down.\n\n\u201cShe never gives up,\u201d Mertens said. \u201cHer serve was coming more in the second and the third set. She\u2019s a good runner, gets the ball back, not a lot of mistakes.\u201d\n\nThe players exchanged holds deep into the third before Andreescu finally broke in the eighth game with a crisp backhand winner down the line. When she finally closed the show with another clean backhand on match point after just over two hours for her 12th consecutive three-set win, the highest ranked teenager on the tour was overcome by disbelief.\n\n\u201cElise, she played really, really well so I just tried to stay as calm as possible,\u201d said Andreescu, who finished with 40 winners against 33 unforced errors. \u201cI just told myself to stay calm and stick to the tactics, which I think really helped in the second and third set.\u201d\n\nAndreescu, who will crack the top 10 for the first time in next week\u2019s rankings after finishing last year at No 178, advances to a Thursday showdown with 13th-seeded Belinda Bencic, another first-time major semi-finalist who came through earlier Wednesday with a straight-sets win over Donna Veki\u0107.\n\n\u201cI think we are professional enough to be friends off the court but do our work on the court and stay focused,\u201d Andreescu said of her forthcoming opponent. \u201cI\u2019m sure off the court we are still friends. I really like the challenge. Some players are maybe afraid of the big courts but for me it is more motivation. I am really enjoying my tennis.\u201d", "description": "The Canadian teenager\u2019s breakthrough season reached yet another high note with a three-set win over Belgium\u2019s Elise Mertens", "authors": ["Bryan Armen Graham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2281480988b488f6687e5b361bd19e3dda69dfb3/0_39_3816_2290/master/3816.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8da03674652cba666bb13561cef6c624", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
