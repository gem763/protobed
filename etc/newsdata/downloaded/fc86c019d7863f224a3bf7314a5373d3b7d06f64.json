These appointments are not limited to medical examinations and can also include relaxation and parent-craft classes,\" Palmer adds.\n\nThe time taken off generally includes the mother's travelling to and from the appointment.\n\n\"Once you've gone to your first appointment, the employer reserves the right to ask her to produce a certificate confirming the pregnancy, such as a MAT B1 ,\" Palmer explains.\n\nThey can also ask for an appointment card or document from a registered medical practitioner or midwife if the time off is for medical examinations.\n\nAlternatively, they may request similar paperwork from a registered health visitor in the case of parent-craft classes.\n\nWhat about time off for dads?\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nEmployees who are the baby's father, or the spouse or partner of the mother, are entitled to take unpaid time off to attend up to two antenatal appointments with her.\n\nTime off for each appointment can be up to six and a half hours, although the employer can permit more time if they choose to.\n\nIn this situation, employers can ask their employee for a written declaration.\n\nThe declaration should confirm the date and time of the appointment, state that the employee has a qualifying relationship with the pregnant woman or her expected child.\n\nIt should also confirm that the time off is to accompany the woman to an antenatal appointment and outline that this appointment is on the advice of a registered medical practitioner, midwife or nurse.\n\n\"Although employers can refuse this time off for a reasonable reason, there is no specific guidance in the law on this, although the timing, length and frequency of the appointments could be a factor,\" Palmer said.\n\nIf employers unreasonably fail to allow this right, they can face a tribunal claim. The claim may result in compensation which is twice the amount of wages the employee would have received had this time off been allowed.\n\n\"They could also face additional claims for unlawful pregnancy and maternity discrimination.\"", "description": "Expectant mothers are entitled to take an unlimited amount of paid time off during regular working hours to receive antenatal care", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Getty Images", "Cultura Rf", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12000381.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PROD-Pensive-pregnant-woman-holding-stomach-in-examination-room.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
