The pastor\u2019s voice would shake with anger as he compared gay people to pedophiles. I knew I was gay, but any time I had thoughts about women, I instantly suppressed them \u2015 though not before a wave a terror washed over me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be interested in boys once I start college,\u201d I told myself. \u201cI\u2019ll be interested in boys when I graduate. I\u2019ll feel normal soon.\u201d\n\nDespite how hard I tried, heterosexual desire never materialized and instead I felt isolated and alone. When I first started dating women, I had panic attacks and nausea so severe that I threw up a few times a week.\n\nSince coming out, I understand the importance of sharing my story and I share it so often that now the words tumble out easily. I share my story because I want people to know how damaging the religion can be and I want people like myself to feel less alone. When I tell my story, though, there is one response I receive often.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened to you, but that\u2019s not what real Christianity is.\u201d\n\nWhile my story of religious abuse is my own, it is not unique. In fact, nearly all of my queer friends have heard some variation of this phrase too, and although I\u2019ve heard this phrase many times by now, it hurts every time. To say this to someone who has just shared their story with you is to look the other way while those of your faith abuse an already marginalized community.\n\nIn fact, Christianity is dangerous to queer people. To pretend otherwise is ignorant at best. Reuters reports that LGBT youth who are raised in religious homes show a 52% increase in suicidal ideation. A study conducted by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force showed that 40% of homeless youth identify as LGBT. Another study by the Albert Kennedy Trust shows that 45% of those homeless LGBT youth were homeless because of the rejection of religious family members.\n\nI recently had a conversation with a queer-affirming Christian friend about this very topic. She expressed how horrified she is by the ways in which Christians hurt the LGBTQ community. She admitted that she has used the \u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened to you but...\u201d phrase before, too. She explained that she just wants her queer friends to know she is a safe person.\n\nWhile I appreciate the intent, the phrase has never once made me feel safer. In fact, the words have only ever made me feel worse. If the intent is pure then why exactly is the statement so hurtful?\n\n\n\nSaying \u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened to you but that\u2019s not what real Christianity is\u201d is manipulative. Since \u201creal\u201d Christianity would never perpetuate such violence then how could that experience of religious trauma even be true? The phrase is almost a form of gaslighting: \u201cA \u2018real\u2019 Christian would never do that to you. Are you sure that actually happened to you?\u201d\n\nThis phrase is dismissive. When queer people share our stories of pain with Christians, it is understandable that they might become defensive. It is understandable that Christians feel guilty that their religion has hurt so many people. Refusing to take accountability, however, by using such a shallow excuse is not the solution.\n\nSpeaking over our voices by explaining that \u201creal Christianity isn\u2019t like that\u201d silences the stories of queer people. This silencing only further empowers homophobic Christians who are literally silencing us through dangerous laws and policies. Instead of speaking over us, queer-affirming Christians should hear our stories and uplift our voices.\n\nThis phrase is condescending and accusatory. It implies that queer people should have stayed in the church for longer \u2015 that we should have tried harder to find \u201creal Christianity.\u201d\n\nFor many of us who grew up in the church, we knew exactly what mainstream Christianity thought about queer people. For years we tried to \u201cpray the gay away.\u201d Many queer people were shipped off to conversion therapy. Many became homeless. To suggest that we didn\u2019t try hard enough to find \u201ctrue Christianity\u201d is unconscionable. For many queer people, choosing to leave the church is a matter of life and death.\n\nFor those queer-affirming Christians who want to let their LGBTQ friends know that they are a safe person, there are different ways to express this without using this shallow clich\u00e9.\n\nFirstly, affirming 100% of our identities is crucial. So many of us are used to the homophobic Christians who use the \u201clove the sinner; hate the sin\u201d trope. Hearing instead that every aspect of our person is loved and valid is imperative. As a queer person, I can\u2019t feel safe with someone who believes that I\u2019m going to hell because my partner just happens to be a woman.\n\nSecondly, recognizing the pain that Christianity has inflicted on queer communities is important. Instead of expressing empty guilt and expecting queer people to assure you that you aren\u2019t homophobic like other Christians, a real apology can go a long way.\n\nThirdly, it is also crucial for queer-affirming Christians to hold other Christians accountable. Hearing our cisgender, heterosexual allies promise to stand up for us and then actually seeing them follow through is what real allyship looks like.\n\nLike many of my queer friends who grew up in toxic religious environments, I am now in therapy. I was told for decades that my body was dangerous, that my desires were evil, that my core self was sinful. Christianity harmed me in a way that I will likely spend the rest of my life reckoning with. Therapy has helped me to rewire my brain to believe instead that I am enough.\n\nDespite it all, I still hold the belief that religion can be a beautiful thing. I hope, though, that Christians will stop telling me that they \u201caren\u2019t like other Christians.\u201d I am instead grateful for Christians who educate themselves and understand just how badly Christianity has harmed the LGBTQ community. I am grateful for Christians who believe us when we tell our stories and who help us amplify our voices. I am grateful for Christians who hold other Christians accountable. I am grateful for the Christians who provide me with safe and loyal friendships.\n\nAlthough Christianity is something I no longer follow, queer-affirming Christians play a crucial role in this moment in history. This month, the Supreme Court heard arguments on cases about whether queer and transgender people should be protected in the workplace by federal civil rights law.\n\nWith a conservative and Christian stacked court, it is entirely possible that the court will rule that LGBTQ people can be discriminated against in the workplace.\n\nIn an evangelical Christian-dominated country that seeks to disenfranchise queer people every single day, the role of LGBTQ-affirming Christians has never been more important.\n\nDo you have a compelling personal story you\u2019d like to see published on HuffPost?
