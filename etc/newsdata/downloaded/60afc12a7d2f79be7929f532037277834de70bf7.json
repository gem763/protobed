He has not been publicly identified yet.\n\nThe NYPD identified the slain officer as 33-year-old Brian Mulkeen.\n\n\u201cWe lost a hero this evening,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference outside Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx.\n\nMulkeen was patrolling the streets around a city apartment complex at around 12:30 a.m. as part of a unit investigating potential gang activity, Chief of Department Terence Monahan said.\n\nMulkeen and his partner tried to apprehend a man who had fled questioning, and a struggle on the ground ensued, Monahan said.\n\nAs the men wrestled, Mulkeen\u2019s body camera recorded him saying, \u201cHe\u2019s reaching for it! He\u2019s reaching for it!\u201d\n\n\u201cOfficer Mulkeen\u2019s gun fired five times,\u201d Monahan said. \u201cAt this point, it is not clear who fired Officer Mulkeen\u2019s gun.\u201d\n\nA .32-caliber revolver that police say belonged to the man was recovered. It had not been fired, Monahan said.\n\nMonahan said the suspect was on probation until 2022 for a narcotics-related arrest last year and had several prior arrests, including a burglary conviction in Rockland County.\n\nMulkeen had served nearly seven years with the department and worked out of the 47th precinct. He lived with his girlfriend, an NYPD police officer in the Bronx\u2019s 44th precinct.\n\nMonahan called the officer \u201cbrave,\u201d and said he was \u201cdoing the job we asked him to do, a job that New Yorkers needed him to do.\u201d\n\nThe track and field program at Fordham University in the Bronx posted that Mulkeen was an alumnus, and had recently become a volunteer coach. The program said that as a student, he was part of the 2008 team that won the Metropolitan Outdoor Track & Field Championship, a first for the program.\n\n\u201cHe was a remarkable human being. Everybody loved him,\u201d the slain officer\u2019s father, also Brian Mulkeen, told the New York Post.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, at an unrelated event, said Mulkeen \u201cmade the greatest sacrifice. He put his life on the line and he lost it in service to the people of this city.\u201d\n\nThe NYPD has had a difficult year, with a number of tragic deaths.\n\nMulkeen is the second NYPD officer killed in the line of duty, following Detective Brian Simonsen, who was accidentally shot by fellow officers in February while confronting a robbery suspect.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here too often. We know the directions to get here,\u201d Pat Lynch, the president of New York City\u2019s Police Benevolent Association, said at the press conference. \u201cIt has to stop.\u201d\n\nMulkeen\u2019s death comes as the NYPD has declared a mental health emergency amid a spate of suicides by police officers. Nine NYPD officers have taken their own lives this year, a disturbing trend that is also happening throughout the country.", "description": "Mulkeen, 33, died Sunday in the Bronx after being shot three times, officials said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9358952100002e00f90629.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
