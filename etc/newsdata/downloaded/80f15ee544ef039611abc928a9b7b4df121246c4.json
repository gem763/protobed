It\u2019s horses for courses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018These press conferences aren\u2019t for detail in the tactics of your game but we just feel it\u2019s the right combination for us this week.\n\n\u2018Work rate is going to be important. Whenever you play New Zealand your work off the ball is going to be massively important.\n\n\u2018They like to move the ball around, they\u2019re very good on transition and George\u2019s work rate off the ball is absolutely exceptional.\u2019\n\nEngland's squad for semi-final Starting XV: Elliot Daly; Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell (capt), Jonny May; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Mako Vunipola, Jamie George, Kyle Sinckler, Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Billy Vunipola. Replacements: Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Marler, Dan Cole, George Kruis, Mark Wilson, Willi Heinz, Henry Slade, Jonathan Joseph.\n\nThere is no place for Joe Launchbury in England\u2019s squad, with Maro Itoje and Courtney Lawes starting at lock and George Kruis named on the substitutes bench.\n\nOn his selections in the second row, Jones explained: \u2018We\u2019ve got four great locks in squad.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a hard decision every game on who we\u2019re going to start with and who we\u2019re going to finish with.\n\n\u2018I believe George Kruis will be exceptional for us finishing the second half and Courtney will throw himself about a bit in the first half.\u2019\n\nNew Zealand squad for semi-final Starting XV: Beauden Barrett; Sevu Reece, Jack Goodhue, Anton Lienert-Brown, George Bridge; Richie Mo\u2019unga, Aaron Smith; Joe Moody, Codie Taylor, Nepo Laulala, Brodie Retallick, Sam Whitelock, Scott Barrett, Ardie Savea, Kieran Read (capt). Replacements: Dane Coles, Ofa Tuungafasi, Angus Ta\u2019avao, Patrick Tuipulotu, Sam Cane, TJ Perenara, Sonny Bill Williams, Jordie Barrett.\n\nJones is relishing the prospect of going head-to-head with the All Blacks this weekend and is confident Steve Hansen\u2019s side have areas of weakness which England can exploit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We have had two and a half years to prepare and we are ready to go. Two heavyweights, one in black one in white, you couldn\u2019t think of a better scenario,\u2019 the England head coach said.\n\n\u2018New Zealand are a great team \u2013 they have an impressive winning record since the last World Cup.\n\n\u2018Like any good team, you have to take time and space away from them and you have to find areas you can pressure them.\n\n\u2018We believe we have identified a number of areas where we can do that.\u2019\n\nMORE: Juventus chief offers update on Manchester United transfer target Mario Mandzukic", "description": "Eddie Jones has revealed that George Ford's 'absolutely exceptional' work rate off the ball was a major factor in his decision to recall the fly-half for England's Rugby World Cup...", "authors": ["Tom Olver"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1179550470_1571909573.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
