Will that have consequences? It\u2019s bound to in the context of the match, but we\u2019re not going to think about it,\u201d Deschamps told reporters at the Stade de France on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a sporting realm, a football match in a football stadium, and we\u2019re going to make sure we stay focused on it.\u201d\n\nTurkey and France are level on 18 points with three games to go in qualifying but the former top the group after their 2-0 defeat of Les Bleus in Konya in June.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get those points back. They outclassed us over there but this is another game,\u201d said Deschamps.\n\nFrance will again be missing the injured Hugo Lloris, Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba, and will be hoping Barcelona recruit Antoine Griezmann can rediscover his sharpest form.\n\nLooming large over the game, however, will be security issues and international diplomatic relations as France decried Turkish military interventions in Syria this week and blocked arms sales to them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that concerns us,\u201d opined France captain Raphael Varane, who said their motivation stems only from the loss in Turkey.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the real us. We want to show our best. Without taking anything away from the Turks, we didn\u2019t perform the way we wanted in the first match.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Military salute \u2013\n\nEuropean football\u2019s ruling body UEFA is looking into reports that Turkey footballers performed a military salute in celebration of Cenk Tosun\u2019s last-gasp winning goal over Albania in Istanbul on Friday.\n\nAfter the match, a photo was also posted on the national team\u2019s official Twitter account with players making a military salute and a caption saying the players \u201chave dedicated their victory to our brave soldiers and fellow martyrs\u201d.\n\nTurkey\u2019s ambassador to France and sports minister are due to attend Monday\u2019s match, with some 3,800 away fans expected in the 78,000 crowd as Senol Gunes\u2019 side look to take a step closer to Euro 2020 qualification.\n\nTurkey could secure a finals place with victory, or possibly a draw, but only if Iceland slip up at home to rank outsiders Andorra.\n\nSecurity at the Stade de France is notoriously tight, and the ground was targeted by three suicide bombers on the night of the November 2015 terror attacks across the French capital.\n\nThe government has qualified the event as high risk and ordered the police to ramp up security measures ahead of and following the game.\n\nThe series of terror attacks on Paris almost four years ago killed 130 people but security prevented a suicide bomber from entering the Stade de France during a game against Germany, which was being watched by then-French President Francois Hollande.\n\nThe bomber and two other assailants detonated their bombs outside the stadium, killing themselves and one bystander.", "description": "Saint-Denis (France) (AFP) \u2013 France coach Didier Deschamps hopes to keep the simmering diplomatic tension with Turkey out of Monday\u2019s Euro", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/191454_didier-deschamps-led-france-final-euro-2016-lost-portugal-extra-time-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
