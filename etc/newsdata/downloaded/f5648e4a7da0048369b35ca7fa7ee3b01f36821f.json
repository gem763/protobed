Photo-Illustration: by Preeti Kinha; Photos: Getty\n\nOn Wednesday, Saturn stations direct in Capricorn, after being retrograde since April. During this transit, you might have found yourself questioning your place in the world: your duties and responsibilities, your victories and failures, your dreams and their limits. As Saturn resumes its direct motion, some of your questions might start to be answered, some of your hazy confusion might turn back into order, and some of your indecision might fall away. Now is the time to begin doing the work you need to do.\n\nAries Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis week, some feelings will be unexplainable, and some problems will be unsolvable\u2014but it won\u2019t last forever. Some mysteries just aren\u2019t willing to be unraveled yet, but your job is to keep trying anyway. Your job is to find new ways to keep launching yourself into the work, even when the results don\u2019t come. Your job is to keep moving, to avoid getting lost in despair. All the good things you\u2019re seeking will find you later on, so don\u2019t give up hope right now.\n\nTaurus Weekly Horoscope\n\nWhen you feel like you lack control of your own life, the easiest response can be to start blaming yourself. When you aren\u2019t getting what you really need, it can feel like the most natural thing in the world to turn your anger inward, to construct a story in which every bad thing that\u2019s ever happened was your own fault. But the world would still be wild today, no matter what you did in the past. Some loneliness would still manage to find you, no matter how carefully you tended to your heart. Don\u2019t blame yourself, and don\u2019t stop moving.\n\nGemini Weekly Horoscope\n\nDon\u2019t look the other way if some conflict arises in your life this week\u2014even if it\u2019s with people with power over you, and even if it\u2019s with people you love. This is a week for treating people with enough respect to disagree with them, and treating your own opinions with enough respect to stand by them. Conflict can be a way to relate to the world. If you\u2019re brave enough to move through it, you can find clarity or softness or love on the other side.\n\nCancer Weekly Horoscope\n\nSometimes it can just be so hard to let yourself be cared for, to open yourself up to another person\u2019s kind attention. Sometimes it can just be so hard to let yourself ask for help, to believe that you don\u2019t have to go it alone. This week, give yourself permission to need things you can\u2019t do for yourself. Give yourself permission to need things you can\u2019t even name. Don\u2019t imagine that you must become totally self-sufficient. There are people in the world waiting to care for you, so let them.\n\nLeo Weekly Horoscope\n\nYou might be convinced that, if you could somehow become perfectly brave, then the world would hold less power over you. If you could become effortlessly strong, then you could protect the people you love from every bad thing. This week, try to take a break from wishing yourself ever braver, ever stronger, ever better. Stop imagining that you could save the whole world with your own two hands, and try to see yourself as you exist right now: imperfect but loved. You\u2019re just one person, but you\u2019re not alone.\n\nVirgo Weekly Horoscope\n\nYou\u2019ve long known that nobody else\u2014not a lover, not a friend, not anyone\u2014can complete you fully or give you everything you need. Still, sometimes, it\u2019s hard not to want exactly this\u2014a person who can make your world make beautiful sense, who can make all the pieces of your brain slide exactly back into place. Try to remember, this week, that you\u2019re already complete. You\u2019re needed deeply, just the way you are.\n\nLibra Weekly Horoscope\n\nIt\u2019s a tricky balance, to honor your past without getting stuck in it, and to move on it without pretending it never existed at all. If your memories and your history call out to you this week, try to listen to them. You don\u2019t have to reject the selves you used to be, or deny the things that happened to you. You don\u2019t have to pretend you\u2019ve never done anything wrong, and nothing has ever hurt you. This is a week for telling the truth about what you know, and what you remember, and what you feel, too.\n\nScorpio Weekly Horoscope\n\nYou work so tirelessly to maintain your solid footing in the world that, sometimes, any motion at all can feel like you\u2019re moving backwards. From the firm position you\u2019ve fought so hard for, any change can feel like loss. You already know that things can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t stay the same forever, but this is a week for reminding yourself of that fact. This is a week for accepting the magic that comes with change, even change you didn\u2019t choose.\n\nSagittarius Weekly Horoscope\n\nWhen the work that needs to be done feels overwhelming, sometimes worry can feel weirdly soothing\u2014it can give you the sense that you\u2019re responding, that you\u2019re aware, that you\u2019re protecting yourself. But this week, worry can end up distracting you from the real matter at hand. It can direct your gaze away from what you should truly be focused on. This week, notice when you start to worry, and let the feeling move through your body, and then let it direct you back into the work.\n\nCapricorn Weekly Horoscope\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve worked hard to believe in your own powers; maybe you\u2019ve worked for years to believe that you\u2019re worthy and good. And it can feel difficult, once you\u2019ve reached this point, to risk change at all. This week, though, try to risk it. Your mind might change, your desires might change, your life might change, but none of that means you\u2019ll lose the love you worked so hard to give yourself.\n\nAquarius Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis week, if the world offers you a chance to revise some of your assumptions, do you best to take it. Changing your mind can be painful\u2014it can change the whole shape of your future, and it can radically alter the way you view your past. It can make you wonder whether all the time you spent before this was wasted. But it wasn\u2019t, of course. Growing older, or weirder, or wiser doesn\u2019t have to be a rebuke of the self you were before.\n\nPisces Weekly Horoscope\n\nYou might just feel a little delicate this week\u2014as though your moods, your ideas and your body are just a little more susceptible to injury than they usually are. And maybe you just need a little sleep, or maybe you need a little friendship, or a little care. Maybe you just need a break. In any case, it\u2019s worth reminding yourself that you don\u2019t need to feel strong to be strong. Your power still exists in you. If you can\u2019t feel it now, it will wait, like a secret, until you can.\n\nGet Madame Clairevoyant every week.
