Valve today shared its plans to make Steam\u2019s local multiplayer games playable online, so from now on, you won\u2019t have to elbow your way into some personal space when you\u2019re already screaming at your teammates for dropping the pasta in Overcooked 2.\n\nValve announced the feature, called Remote Play Together, to developers who then shared the news with the public. Its beta is launching around October 21. Any game that offers local multiplayer (including split-screen and local-co-op play) will be able to plug in an online player 2 using a Steam Overlay. \u201cWhen the Friend accepts an invitation to play, it\u2019s as though they\u2019re playing side by side at the same machine,\u201d Valve\u2019s message reads. It continues:\n\n\u201cMuch like a traditional split-screen experience, the host\u2019s computer is running the game, but with Remote Play Together friends can join using their own controllers, voice, audio, and display \u2014 regardless of whether they also own the game on Steam. Any controllers connected to the second player\u2019s computer will act as if they\u2019re plugged directly into the first computer. The player hosting the game can also choose to allow or block inputs to their shared keyboard and mouse.\u201d\n\nUp to four players will be able to game together with Remote Play Together. Valve says it \u201crenders 60 frames per second at a resolution of 1080p,\u201d too, if your internet is good enough.", "description": "Sometimes, you\u2019d rather stretch out on the living room couch in your underwear than be the deli meat in a couch co-op sandwich.
