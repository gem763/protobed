Oakland (87-60) moved a half-game ahead in the AL wild-card race with a 3-2 win at Houston.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good ballclub over there that\u2019s fighting for a wild-card spot,\u201d said Solak, who is hitting .360 after going 6 of 11 against the Rays. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to play against teams that are good like that. And to come out and show them what we can do.\u201d\n\nSolak and Fairbanks were swapped July 13, a little more than a month before the Texas infielder and designated hitter made his major league debut and about a month after the fellow rookie Fairbanks first pitched for the Rangers.\n\n\u201cThe guy\u2019s on a tear right now. What can you say?\u201d said Fairbanks, reminding everyone that the Rangers are about to host the A\u2019s in a weekend series. \u201cI\u2019ll buy him as many steaks as he wants if he does the same thing to the A\u2019s that he did to us.\u201d\n\nJi-Man Choi set a Tampa Bay record by reaching base 10 straight times over two games. He opened with a single before walking four straight times, the last one in the ninth before Nate Lowe grounded into a game-ending double play.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll certainly take the presence in the lineup that he\u2019s providing right now,\u201d manager Kevin Cash said. \u201cSeems that a lot of good things that we\u2019ve done offensively, it\u2019s come with him on base or him at the plate.\u201d\n\nLuke Farrell preserved a one-run lead after Texas starter Kolby Allard allowed all five batters he faced in the fifth inning to reach, just after Solak capped a four-run inning that broke a 1-all tie. Austin Meadows\u2019 two-run double and an RBI single from Tommy Pham got the Rays close.\n\nFarrell (1-0) struck out a pair with two runners on, then retired Daniel Robertson on a flyout after Joey Wendle\u2019s infield single loaded the bases. The right-hander pitched a perfect sixth, followed by scoreless innings from Jonathan Hern\u00e1ndez and Rafael Montero.\n\nJos\u00e9 Leclerc worked the ninth for his career-best 13th save as Texas (74-74) reached the .500 mark for the first time since Aug. 14.\n\nSTRUGGLES SINCE DEBUT\n\nBrendan McKay (2-4) lost his third straight decision, allowing three runs in 3 1/3 innings to push the left-hander\u2019s ERA to 5.27.\n\nIt\u2019s been 2\u00bd months since the 23-year-old rookie beat the Rangers with Tampa Bay\u2019s longest scoreless outing in a major league debut, retiring the first 16 Texas batters over six innings in a 5-2 win.\n\nEJECTION, THEN HOMER\n\nRougned Odor\u2019s 26th homer was a solo shot in the seventh for the Rangers, not long after manager Chris Woodward was ejected by home plate umpire Mike Muchlinski in the top of the inning for arguing balls and strikes with Hern\u00e1ndez on the mound. \u201cI was wrong by the way,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cIt was a ball.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRays: OF Kevin Kiermaier said he would be available off the bench after a stiff neck sidelined him for the first two games in the ballpark where he made his major league debut as a defensive replacement in a tiebreaker for an AL wild-card spot in 2013.\n\nRangers: OF Hunter Pence, who made his fourth All-Star team after deciding not to retire and joining the Rangers on a minor league contract, came closer to acknowledging that a back injury will sideline him for the rest of the season. The 36-year-old suggested his focus has turned to the offseason, and preparing to play again next year. Woodward said the Rangers want him back if it makes sense for the roster.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRays: RHP Charlie Morton (14-6, 3.11 ERA) is set for the opener of a three-game series at the LA Angels on Friday. The two-time All-Star is trying to become a 15-game winner for the second straight season.\n\nRangers: LHP Brock Burke (0-1, 3.52) is set for his fifth career start in the opener of a three-game series at home against Oakland. The 23-year-old was acquired from Tampa Bay in the offseason in a three-team trade that also involved the A\u2019s.\n\n___\n\nCorrects previous versions to show that Ji-Man Choi\u2019s record streak of reaching base 10 straight times is in two games, not three.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nick Solak isn't getting to enjoy a playoff race in Texas after making his major league debut with the Rangers following a trade when he was a prospect for AL wild-card contender Tampa Bay.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/rays_rangers_baseball_04009_c0-269-4413-2842_s1770x1032.jpg?b7ca3428c2daf8442d9928635360a2706f966a81", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
