But the thought of taking them off in the morning and putting on \u201creal\u201d clothes can feel like torture when you\u2019re not feeling up to facing the world.\n\nAccording to Alyssa Dana Adomaitis, professor and director of the business and technology of fashion program at New York City College of Technology, there\u2019s a reason the human brain might gravitate toward less professional garments when experiencing an \u201coff\u201d day: role theory.\n\nIn practice, Adomaitis explained, role theory means you \u2014 albeit subconsciously \u2014 dress for the position \u201cyou want to portray.\u201d If you\u2019re not feeling especially great about yourself (and you don\u2019t have a full agenda), Adomaitis said that sometimes \u201cyour emotions that will get the best of you\u201d when you\u2019re deciding what to wear. And thus a sweatpants-based outfit is born.\n\nBut instead of letting emotions dictate our outfits, what if we strategically selected outfits that could sway our mood in a direction of our choosing? Experts on the various links between clothing, culture and human behavior whom HuffPost spoke to all support the idea that intentional clothing choices can have subtle but meaningful impacts on our behavior and outlook.\n\nAndrew Reilly, a professor who teaches a class on culture, gender and appearance at the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa, likens the impact of clothing on human behavior to that of music. Different kinds of music, Reilly said, \u201cinfluence how you\u2019re going to behave, what you feel.\u201d The same can be said of our garments: \u201cWe can use clothing to elevate our moods.\u201d\n\nBelow, experts on the link between clothing and psychology share which pieces hiding in our closets might adjust our outlook and behavior.\n\nBrzozowska via Getty Images Research has found that dressing more formally than your usual day-to-day outfits alters your way of thinking.\n\nConsider suiting up.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a power boost, try throwing on an interview-worthy outfit. In a 2015 study, California State University-Northridge psychology professor Abraham Rutchick and his team found that dressing more formally than you usually do alters your way of thinking.\n\nParticipants in Rutchick\u2019s study were asked to show up to the experiment with two outfits: one they\u2019d wear to class and another to a job interview. Researchers concluded that when dressed in more formal clothing \u2014 whatever the participants deemed as interview-worthy \u2014 they engaged in more abstract, \u201cbig picture\u201d thinking.\n\n\u201cLeaders are the people who have these big ideas,\u201d Rutchick explained. \u201cFollowers are the ones who have to worry about the details.\u201d He said his team\u2019s \u201cbest guess\u201d about why this happens is that people feel a heightened sense of power in formal clothing, which leads to \u201ca grander, broader, bigger picture view of the world.\u201d\n\nSo, does wearing a blazer mean you\u2019ll perform better than usual if you normally might wear a T-shirt for the same task? No. But a more formal outfit could help you to make decisions with a broader perspective in mind. According to Rutchick, this tactic isn\u2019t \u201cmagic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a subtle effect,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nMine your closet for memories.\n\nReilly and Johnson both noted that wearing items with strong positive attachments can be effective in swaying your outlook. Reilly pointed to perfume in particular.\n\n\u201cHumans are social animals and we get a boost from positive responses and reactions from others.\u201d - Kim Johnson, professor emeritus at University of Minnesota\n\nAccording to a 2016 article published in Brain Science, studies show that \u201cautobiographical memories triggered by odors feel much more emotional\u201d than memories triggered by other factors. Thanks to an activation of a specific part of the brain, \u201cpeople are more brought to the original time and place of their memories\u201d when the remembering is triggered by scent compared to when the same events are recalled in other ways.\n\nIf a certain scent takes you back to a particularly happy place, give it spritz when you\u2019re feeling a bit \u201cmeh\u201d and see how it makes you feel. And if a scent doesn\u2019t jump out as especially noteworthy, Kim Johnson, a University of Minnesota professor emeritus who taught a course examining the effect of dress on human behavior, notes that wearing good luck charms might also be worth a try.\n\nA 2010 study published in Psychological Science examining the effect of superstitions found evidence supporting the idea that believers in good luck charms might really be on to something. One of the study\u2019s tests invited 41 participants, all of whom reported having a designated lucky charm, to bring said charm with them to an experiment. Only some participants were allowed to keep the good luck charm while performing assigned tasks while others had to carry on without them. Results showed that those who kept their lucky charm \u201creported higher levels of self-efficacy\u201d than those without the charm.\n\nSo, if you believe that something you wore helped achieve a desired outcome in the past, it might be enough to provide an added sense of security and confidence the next time you wear it. In other words, don\u2019t throw out those lucky socks just yet.\n\nFlatter yourself.\n\nAn \u201coff\u201d day is precisely the right time to wear whichever garment most reliably rakes in the compliments. Humans \u201dare social animals and we get a boost from positive responses and reactions from others,\u201d Johnson explained. If a particular item in your wardrobe previously garnered positive feedback, it\u2019s likely that giving it another spin could provide a confidence boost today.\n\nAnd if you need another reason to get those pants hemmed, Adomaitis noted that people tend to feel most comfortable and confident in well-tailored clothing. The less fussing and pulling at your clothing you\u2019re doing, the less self-conscious you\u2019ll be.\n\nBe yourself.\n\nReilly points out that wearing specific colors, cuts or fabrics just because someone tells you to won\u2019t necessarily create positive adjustments if you feel awkward in them. \u201cI don\u2019t think [those colors] are going to do any good for you if you\u2019re wearing them because you\u2019re just told to wear them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to look at what you are physically comfortable in and psychologically comfortable in.\u201d\n\nFor example, he explained, \u201cPeople may say tight-fitting clothes are on trend, but if you\u2019re not psychologically comfortable,\u201d wearing them will likely just cause greater stress than whatever bonus you might have anticipated from fitting in with the group.\n\nTo that end, skip out on wearing fake designer goods. Even if they\u2019re convincing enough to dupe everyone in the office, a 2010 study published in Psychological Science shows it might not give you the confidence boost you\u2019re hoping for. When participants were given knockoff designer sunglasses to wear, findings showed that regardless of initial interest in owning them, wearing them caused increased negative feelings about the self, particularly the sense of being a fraud.\n\nOf course, what you wear can only change so much about your outlook.
