And we grew that business very, very quickly.\u201d\n\nModerator Adam Shapiro (L) and Eric Trump attend the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit at Union West Events on October 10, 2019 in New York City.

''I wouldn\u2019t be working if they were. I\u2019m a European, a very traditional woman, and I believe in my children working hard. After school, they\u2019re off to ballet, tennis, painting lessons, play dates, birthday parties \u2014 which keeps them out of trouble \u2014 and I\u2019m right there at 5:30 to go from one to the other with their homework. We all have dinner at 7. No business. No phone calls.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, then-22-year-old Eric Trump told The New York Times that his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., had \u201calways been my best friend, a mentor\u2026 In a way, he raised me. My father, I love and I appreciate, but he always worked 24 hours a day.\u201d\n\nEric Trump on Thursday stressed that the family was close-knit. \u201cAs a family, we do everything together. We love each other. We are very loyal to each other. And if one person does something, we all hop in and we help,\u201d he said.\n\nFamily portrait of, from left, socialite Ivana Trump, her son Eric Trump, her former husband Donald Trump, and her daughter Ivanka Trump as they sit at a table at the Mar-a-Lago estate, Palm Beach, Florida, 1998.

And a little show called \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 came along. And all of a sudden, we were reality TV people. And I'm not really a \u2026 reality TV person. It's not kind of who we are.\n\nBut the show did incredibly well. And then, fast forward a couple of years past that, and all of a sudden, you know, he's running for president of the United States,\u201d he explained.\n\nStill, Donald Trump\u2019s foray into politics wasn\u2019t as sudden as it might have seemed. While President Trump and his allies often describe him as new to politics, the fact remains that he had dabbled in the public arena for many, many years.\n\nIn October 1999, Donald Trump announced the creation of a presidential exploratory committee as a candidate of the Reform Party. He ended the campaign in early 2000.\n\nDonald Trump takes the stage on the last day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, the United States in 2016.
