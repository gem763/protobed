Last month Daniel broke his steely demeanour as he let loose at the wrap party for his filming in Matera, southern Italy - where he was seen making an emotional speech while under the influence\n\nNo Time To Die has reportedly filmed three different endings so as to avoid plot details being leaked.\n\nDirector Cary- who took over the project from Danny Boyle - is said to be the only one who knows which of the three finales will make the final cut, with even star of the film Daniel Craig in the dark about it.\n\nThe Mirror reported on Monday that a Bond insider revealed: 'Everyone\u2019s in the dark, the secrecy is off the chart.'\n\nOne alleged ending sees Bond apparently quit the secret service for a 'tranquil life in Jamaica', with British actress Lashana Lynch being awarded the code 007.\n\nSpeech: Standing around a Bond-themed cake, the 007 actor admitted to his cast and crew that he was 'really quite drunk' before thanking them for 'all their hard work'\n\nThere was allegedly mass panic after crew members on the spy thriller left behind a van following days of filming on location there, prompting 400 people to be evacuated from the base which was put on lockdown as bomb dogs were brought in.\n\nHundreds were reportedly ordered away while police cordoned off a large area with rumours swirling that the vehicle in question was full of pyrotechnic explosives, however that was later disproved.\n\nWhile it proved to be a simple case of No Time to Die's technicians accidentally leaving behind a vehicle after filming last week, The Sun have reported that it inadvertently prompted a terror scare.\n\nThe panic reportedly began when security at RAF Brize Norton ordered a lockdown at 7pm after coming to the realisation that the van\u2019s security passes had lapsed.\n\nA source told the publication: 'Everything was packed up on Friday but amazingly one of the vans was left behind outside the mess. I don\u2019t know if it was the film company or the hire company, but someone reported the van.\n\n'Sniffer dogs from a bomb disposal unit were sent in to investigate immediately. A 300 metre cordon was put in place while it was assessed by bomb disposal teams.'\n\n'It is an unbelievable blunder to have caused such a massive security risk,' the source added.\n\nIt was also noted that despite getting a 'slap on the wrist', film companies will still be encouraged to make movies at the base because it 'brings in a lot of money.'\n\nNew guard: Daniel will star alongside returning Bond girls Lea Seydoux and Naomie Harris and new actresses Ana De Armas and Lashana Lynch\n\nLast year the base was used to film part of Mission: Impossible - Fallout.\n\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for Bond's No Time To Die and Daniel Craig for further comment.\n\nSo high was the alert that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was said to have been kept abreast of the situation until it was given the all clear.\n\nAn RAF spokesman has revealed the following statement: 'The RAF can confirm that a vehicle with a lapsed pass was identified at RAF Brize Norton last night.\n\n'To ensure the safety of our people a cordon was set up and a number of personnel were moved.\n\n'Subsequently, the vehicle was checked & identified and as it posed no threat, all personnel were returned to their accommodation.'\n\nThis isn't the first Bond 25 has been hit by a setback since production started, with injuries, crew reshuffles and even explosions marring work on the film\n\nDaniel underwent an operation as a result of tweaking his ankle ligaments after falling during filming for a high-octane scene in Jamaica back in May.\n\nThe surgery was followed by two weeks of rehabilitation, causing delays to the production schedule.\n\nMeanwhile over at the UK's Pinewood Studios three explosions went off on set after a stunt went wrong during filming earlier this summer.\n\nHealth and Safety officials arrived on the set of the beleaguered movie after an explosion ripped a hole in a sound stage and injured a member of the crew.\n\nBond is back: Daniel looked dapper as 007 in the first poster for No Time To Die earlier this month\n\nThe official Twitter account for the 007 franchise confirmed the blasts, with a post saying: 'During the filming of a controlled explosion on the set of Bond 25 today at Pinewood Studios, damage was caused to the exterior of the 007 Stage.\n\n'There were no injuries on set, however one crew member outside the stage has sustained a minor injury.'\n\nThe film is co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge who was brought on board to sprinkle her magic on the script for the 25th movie in the film franchise based on Ian Fleming's hit novels.\n\nThe film had previously been given the working title Shatterhand, however the title has since been changed to match Bond's more iconic film titles.\n\nProduction finally kicked off in April of this year, though it had already been delayed by several months following the departure of original director Danny Boyle.\n\nDebut: His debut film as Bond, Casino Royale, was released in November 2006\n\nAnd he's back: After earning a BAFTA nomination for his first turn as Bond, Daniel Craig reprised the role for Quantum of Solace in 2008\n\nThe film, which also stars Naomie Harris, Lashana Lynch, Ana de Armas, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw, sees Rami Malek take on the role of an as-yet-untitled villain.\n\nBut it has suffered a turbulent production process in recent months after Craig suffered a nasty ankle injury while filming a separate chase sequence in Jamaica, the spiritual home of Bond creator Ian Fleming.\n\nThe actor underwent an operation followed by two weeks of rehabilitation in May, causing major delays to the long awaited production.\n\nThe official Twitter account for Bond 25 released a statement concerning his injuries at the time, writing: 'Daniel Craig will be undergoing minor ankle surgery resulting from an injury sustained during filming in Jamaica.\n\n'Production will continue whilst Craig is rehabilitating for two weeks post-surgery. The film remains on track for the same release date in April 2020'.\n\nNumber three: His third Bond film, Skyfall, premiered in 2012 and is currently the highest-grossing film in the series\n\nNumber four: He reprised his role as James Bond in Spectre, which was released in 2015\n\nMovie star: He had been seen filming intense, action packed scenes in Italy for the eagerly-anticipated 25th instalment of James Bond's 25th film No Time To Die\n\nDaniel Craig achieved international fame when chosen as the sixth actor to play Ian Fleming's British secret agent James Bond in the eponymous film series, taking over from Piece Brosnan in 2005.\n\nIt is unclear whether filming for No Time To Die has wrapped for the other actors involved. MailOnline has contacted representatives for James Bond for further comment.\n\nJust weeks ago, Daniel was seen gripping his co-star L\u00e9a Seydoux's hand as they leaped across a railway track\n\nSince Daniel announced he was standing down as James Bond, debate has raged whether the next 007 should be a woman, or black.\n\nAnd in July, The Mail on Sunday revealed that she will be both \u2013 thanks to the intervention of feminist TV writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\n\n'Popcorn dropping moment': Since Daniel announced he was stepping down in the next movie, British star Lashana, 31, will be given Bond's licence to kill in the 25th movie in the franchise\n\nIn what's been called a 'popcorn-dropping moment', British star Lashana, 31, will be given Bond's licence to kill in the 25th movie in the franchise.\n\nHowever, traditionalists can relax: she's not the new Bond, but a new character who takes over his secret agent number after he leaves MI6.\n\nThe story begins with Bond retired in Jamaica. But spymaster M \u2013 played by Ralph Fiennes \u2013 calls him back in desperation to tackle a new global crisis.\n\nA movie insider said: 'There is a pivotal scene at the start of the film where M says 'Come in 007', and in walks Lashana who is black, beautiful and a woman.\n\n'It's a popcorn-dropping moment. Bond is still Bond but he's been replaced as 007 by this stunning woman.\n\n'Bond, of course, is sexually attracted to the new female 007 and tries his usual seduction tricks, but is baffled when they don't work on a brilliant, young black woman who basically rolls her eyes at him and has no interest in jumping into his bed. Well, certainly not at the beginning.'\n\nThe source added that the phrase 'Bond girls' is now forbidden, saying: 'We were all told that from now on they are to be addressed as 'Bond women'.'\n\nDr Swann and Bond's romance, sparked in Spectre, appears to still be going strong in No Time To Die, with the pair sharing a passionate kiss during filming last week.\n\nNo Time To Die has a UK release date of April 3, 2020, and opens in the US on April 8, 2020.\n\nThe countdown is on: No Time To Die has a UK release date of April 3, 2020, and opens in the US on April 8, 2020", "description": "Filming has officially wrapped on the 25th chapter in the James Bond franchise, No Time To Die.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland", "Ellie Phillips For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/01/20203474-0-image-a-58_1572050067924.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
