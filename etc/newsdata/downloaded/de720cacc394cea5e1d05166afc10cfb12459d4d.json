Anybody could shoot eight- or nine-under.\u201d\n\nNa started the day in a four-way tie for the lead with Cantlay, Lucas Glover and Brian Stuard.\n\nHe opened with birdies at the first and second, but said his biggest putt of the day was a 22-footer to save par at the par-three fifth.\n\n\u201cI had nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI hit it to about 25 feet and made a 25-footer that broke six feet for par.\u201d\n\nHe rolled in a 20-foot birdie putt at the eighth and a 30-footer at 10. After a 16-foot birdie at 13 and an eight-footer at 15 his five-foot birdie miss at 16 was a shock.\n\nHe rebounded quickly, however, closing with back-to-back birdies with putts of 14 and 12 feet.\n\nStuard and Glover were unable to gain ground, Glover posting a 66 that left him tied for fourth with Sam Ryder on 196 and Stuard finishing six shots off the pace after a 67.\n\nAmerican Tony Finau, among the players hoping from some good results to catch the eye of US Presidents Cup captain Tiger Woods before he makes his last selections for the team for the December match play showdown in Australia, carded a 62 that featured an eagle and seven birdies.\n\n\u201cIt motivates me,\u201d Finau said of the Presidents Cup. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit disappointed that I didn\u2019t make the team. Maybe that\u2019s lighting a little bit of a fire in me going into the season.\u201d", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Kevin Na equalled his career-low round with a 10-under par 61 on Saturday to take a two-stroke lead over fellow American Patrick", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/120e09_na-fires-61-shot-pga-lead-in-las-vegas-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
