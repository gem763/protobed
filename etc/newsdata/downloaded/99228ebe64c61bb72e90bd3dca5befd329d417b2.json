I think it\u2019s a huge political thing, but we are leaders and we can step up at times.\u201d\n\nMr. James\u2019 comments come in the wake of a controversy that erupted when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted on Oct. 4, \u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe league issued an apology for the tweet and Mr. James eventually weighed in by saying the general manager \u201cwasn\u2019t educated on the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not just financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually,\u201d Mr. James told reporters Monday. \u201cSo just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do, even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.\u201d\n\nThe athlete, however, has not hesitated to speak on political issues over the years.\n\n\u201cThis is a beautiful country and we\u2019re never going to let one person dictate how beautiful and how powerful we are,\u201d he said of Mr. Trump in December 2017. \u201cObviously, I\u2019ve been \u2026 very outspoken and well-spoken about the situation that\u2019s going on at the helm here. Equality is all about understanding our rights, understanding what we stand for and how powerful we are as men and as women, black or white or Hispanic. It doesn\u2019t matter your race.\u201d\n\n.@KingJames on China/Hong Kong: \u201cI won\u2019t be talking about it again \u2026 we\u2019re not politicians, I think it\u2019s a huge political thing \u2026 it was a challenging trip for all of us in China.\u201d pic.twitter.com/w2gLb7BgnV \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 16, 2019\n\n\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
