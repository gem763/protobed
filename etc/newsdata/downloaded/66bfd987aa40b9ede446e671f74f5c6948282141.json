It\u2019s natural to feel as though we\u2019ve fallen into a rut when our everyday routines become predictable with little to no variation.\n\nThese seasons are even more frustrating for believers because we are always searching for God\u2019s grand plan and purpose in our lives. I\u2019m not proud of it, but I have had moments when I\u2019ve asked God, \u201cHow could anything good honestly come from where I am now?\u201d or \u201cIs this REALLY what you had in mind? Did I hear You wrong, God?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m young, but I\u2019ve had enough experience with God to know that He is always up to something good, no matter how dull or desolate our situations might seem. But don\u2019t take it from me. There are countless examples of this truth throughout the Bible. One that particularly stands out is the story of Jesus calling on Simon Peter to become His disciple.\n\nJESSICA PHILLIPS: A WEEK AFTER A MASS SHOOTING, WE IN WEST TEXAS RISE WITH STRENGTH AND OUR FAITH\n\nSimon Peter and some of his friends had spent an entire night out on the lake trying to catch fish, and they had literally caught nothing. I\u2019m sure as the night went on they tried everything they could think of to solve their dilemma. But nothing worked, and by morning they decided to give up.\n\nJesus repeatedly told His disciples to trust Him -- to follow Him with true faith by putting their lives in His hands. He asks us to do the same thing.\n\nKeep in mind, Simon and his companions were fishermen by trade. This was as much about their livelihood as about feeding themselves. When I think about this scenario in that context, these men seem much more relatable to modern life. Often we find ourselves caught in routines out of necessity, which can make us feel trapped in our circumstances. But that doesn\u2019t mean Jesus can\u2019t bring fruit out of these seemingly hopeless situations.\n\nJust as the men resolved to call it quits, Jesus climbed into their boat and told them to go through their routine one more time -- to try again:\n\n\u201cSimon answered, \u2018Master, we\u2019ve worked hard all night and haven\u2019t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.\u2019 When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.\u201d (Luke 5:5-6)\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve been fishing for a while with no tangible result. I know I\u2019ve been there before. In these moments, we should look to Simon Peter as an example and obey God\u2019s direction, even if we can\u2019t see the future benefit of living out another day of whatever routine we are experiencing.\n\nNone of us can begin to comprehend how God weaves every moment of the lives of His followers to work out His greater plan. We have to learn to accept this on faith day by day. Our human nature causes us to turn away from God repeatedly. That\u2019s why every single day we have to start all over again and rely on God as our guide. Jesus repeatedly told His disciples to trust Him -- to follow Him with true faith by putting their lives in His hands. He asks us to do the same thing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChristian speaker and activist Christine Caine once said, \u201cHe\u2019s preparing you for what He\u2019s prepared for you.\u201d Let\u2019s not lose hope as believers, but rather use every day as an opportunity to be groomed by our Creator, no matter how boring or frustrating it may seem. You never know when Jesus will call you to toss your net to the other side of the boat. Trust in Him and His perfect provision for you.\n\n\u201cLet us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.\u201d (Galatians 6:9)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CHRISTEN LIMBAUGH BLOOM", "description": "Jesus repeatedly told His disciples to trust Him\u00a0--\u00a0to follow Him with true faith by putting their lives in His hands.
