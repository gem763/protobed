It describes itself as an \u201cautonomous college\u201d within NUS.\n\nIn its report into the cancellation of last month\u2019s course, Yale said it could have led to international students \u2014 nine out of the course\u2019s 16 participants \u2014 breaking tough laws against protests.\n\nOnly citizens and those holding permanent residency status are allowed to protest at Speakers\u2019 Corner.\n\nCourse instructor Alfian Sa\u2019at, a prominent Singaporean playwright and political activist, disputed the report\u2019s allegations that he had rejected proposed changes to the syllabus and had been reckless to expose foreign students to arrest.\n\nSome were more concerned that the high-profile row could have a chilling effect on academia.\n\nSingapore academics may now be cautious when teaching contentious topics lest they be \u201caccused of subversion, flawed scholarship or activist motivation\u201d, said Walter Theseira, a non-elected legislator and professor at Singapore University of Social Sciences.\n\n\u201cThis will be bad for our youth, and bad for Singapore,\u201d he told parliament.", "description": "Singapore (AFP) \u2013 Yale\u2019s Singapore college has become embroiled in a row about academic freedom after axing a course on dissent, with the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/f83a1a_yale-singapore-college-has-embroiled-in-row-academic-freedom-axing-on-dissent-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
