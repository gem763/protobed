He has grown in his role and become an integral part of the team.\n\nICC\n\nFor years, India was looking for an all-rounder who could bat and also contribute with the ball. Since making his debut, Hardik Pandya has proved to be an useful asset and contributed to the team's success.\n\nNow the 25 year-old is out injured and recently underwent back surgery, meaning he will miss at least five months of action. He will be a loss no doubt, but there are players who could step up and fill in for his role.\n\nHere are the five players who could do just that:\n\n1. Krunal Pandya\n\nDon't Miss 1.2 K SHARES 497 SHARES 357 SHARES\n\nThe elder of the Pandya brothers, Krunal has been around for a while in India's limited overs setup, mostly in the T20 format. A left-arm orthodox bowler, Krunal Pandya has performed decently in whatever opportunities have been presented to him.\n\nHe is yet to be tested in the 50-over format, but his ability to chip in with the bat along with his wicket-taking ability, he can step in for his brother.\n\n2. Vijay Shankar\n\nA highly rated middle-order batsman, he is a more than useful medium-pacer as well, a skill that has made him a more than handy all-rounder.\n\nAnother talented all-rounder who has got his opportunities with the Indian team, Vijay Shankar has promised much, but delivered too little.\n\nGenuine all-rounders are a rare commodity in Indian cricket and Vijay Shankar's solidity with the bat and usefulness with the ball earned him a place in the national team.\n\nHe has shown glimpse of his potential, but nothing of significant note. An injury to Hardik Pandya gives him the opportunity to perform and cement his place in the Indian side.\n\n3. Axar Patel\n\nBCCI\n\nHaving made his debut five years back, Axar Patel has been in and out of the Indian team. He has largely been under-utilised with the bat, but he has troubled many batsmen with his accurate bowling, cramping the batsmen for room and buying wickets.\n\nAs has been the case of so many like him, Axar has failed to establish himself as the regular in the India's limited overs team. He has to talent and ability, and it is the right time put his hand up and deliver good performances.\n\nWith T20 World Cup coming up next year, the time is now for the likes of Axar Patel to perform.\n\n4. Washington Sundar\n\nThe 20 year-old is one amongst a batch of cricketers who are presumed to be one of India's next generation players. Still only young, Washington Sundar has quickly been drafted into the senior side.\n\nThe off-spinner is seen with the potential of having a long and successful career. Having made he debut in 2017, the Tamil Nadu native is become a regular in the T20 squads.\n\nHe is, however, yet to find his way into ODI team, having played a solitary game in 2017. With Hardik now out, he might get the opportunity to fulfil the role of the all-rounder.\n\n5. Ravindra Jadeja\n\nThe 30 year-old is one of the most experienced players around, and he has been a terrific servant to the Indian team. He is one of the most underrated players in the game.\n\nHe can bat, bowl, and save you good 20-25 runs on the field. He is now a decade old in international cricket, but he still has a lot to offer. Having been ignored for the limited overs format in the last few years, Jadeja put in terrific performance at the World Cup to silence his critics.\n\nHe now has the opportunity to fully establish himself and not let the team feel the absence of Hardik Pandya.", "description": "Hardik Pandya has been one of the star performers for the India team over the last few years.
