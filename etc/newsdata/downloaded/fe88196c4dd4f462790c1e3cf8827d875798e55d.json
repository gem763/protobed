We\u2019re only really focussing on how we play, looking at our performance levels,\u201d Rodgers, 46, told the BBC.\n\nRodgers may be keen to downplay Leicester\u2019s strong start to the season, in which they have taken 14 points from seven games to sit behind champions Manchester City and early pace-setters Liverpool, but it is hard to ignore his impact.\n\nSince taking over from Claude Puel in February, the former Celtic boss has transformed the club to raise fans\u2019 hopes of a return to European competition since the 2016-17 season which followed their shock Premier League triumph.\n\nLeicester have won 31 points since the Northern Irishman\u2019s first game in March - more than any other team in the league barring City (46) and Liverpool (49), who they face next.\n\nRodgers has also turned Leicester into a slick machine that can counter-attack and dominate possession with ease, as they displayed against Newcastle.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the top two teams in this country, they\u2019re brilliant with the ball,\u201d Rodgers added.\n\n\u201cThey can have long periods of possession, 60-70%, but when they have to counter attack, they counter attack. We saw that today from us.\n\n\u201cWe pressed hard, we were hungry for goals. A clean sheet, five good goals. It\u2019s a good day for us.\u201d", "description": "Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has played down his team's chances of a top-four finish and an automatic Champions League spot despite thumping 10-man Newcastle United 5-0 on Sunday to climb to third in the Premier League.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435409699&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T093", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
