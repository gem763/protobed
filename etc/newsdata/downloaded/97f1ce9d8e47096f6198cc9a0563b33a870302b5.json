And they have not done so yet, as far as I know.'\n\nLuka Jovic has endured a tough time at Madrid since his \u00a350m move, failing to score a goal\n\nThe 27-year-old's Spurs contract expires next summer, and Madrid may wait until then to snap him up for free.\n\nMeanwhile a possible Pogba move to Los Blancos has been mooted ever since Zidane returned to Madrid last year.\n\nMadrid already have two star midfielders in Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, but the duo are not getting any younger, with Kroos turning 30 in the new year and Modric at 34 years of age.", "description": "Los Blancos supremo Florentino Perez is said to have told manager Zinedine Zidane to instead utilise the squad he has after sanctioning a \u00a3300million spending spree in the summer.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/10/20275016-0-image-a-7_1572259169118.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
