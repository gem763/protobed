It won't win any awards, but I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Yes, the second act wavers a bit, but the ending was actually pretty satisfying (always important, in horror films).'\n\nRattlesnake is currently streaming on Netflix.", "description": "Netflix's latest Halloween offering Rattlesnake has left horror fans disappointed.", "authors": ["Jabeen Waheed For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/12/20373578-0-image-a-59_1572438108145.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
