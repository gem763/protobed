The supporters\u2019 opinion... we need to accept that.\n\n\u201cWe lost a very big opportunity in the Premier League to (move up to) third in the table. We are fifth and have chances on Sunday. We have to get better but it\u2019s one process... In that process I am happy.\n\n\u201cWe need to think how we can... progress and achieve our targets. Immediately, that\u2019s to win tomorrow. In this competition we won two matches and played very well with very good results.\u201d\n\nArsenal are top of Group F with six points from two games and Emery believes a positive performance against the winless bottom side would help them when they host Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\n\u201cFirstly, respect to Guimaraes. They are fourth in the (Portuguese) table and a good team, a competitive team,\u201d Emery added. \u201cWe are expecting a difficult match.\n\n\u201cAgainst Eintracht Frankfurt and Standard Liege, (we had) good performances and (had) a good idea in our way to create and to find our way for playing aggressively in the future \u2014 compact and very good defensively and offensively.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal manager Unai Emery said he accepts fans' criticism after his side's insipid display in the defeat at Sheffield United but he is now fully focused on staying top of their Europa League group with a win over Vitoria Guimaraes on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444154971&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1GI", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
