It's sort of like a \"finsta\": a portmanteau for \"fake Instagram,\" a secondary, sometimes-private account where people post photos they don't want to put on their main accounts. There's a whole sect of celebrities who have finsta accounts \u2014 including Sophie Turner, Ariana Grande , and Justin Bieber \u2014 but they're known to the public.\n\nBut the secret accounts belonging to Lawrence and Aniston are completely unknown and not used for posting photos unworthy of their main accounts. I personally have a second Instagram account I use strictly for following influencers and creators that doesn't post or even have a profile photo.\n\nIn the same interview where she talked about having a \"voyeur\" social-media presence, Lawrence also voiced her distaste for the internet, saying that it breeds \"backlash\" and has \"scorned\" her in the past. Despite her objections, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of Lawrence publicly joining social media in the future. Long before joining Instagram, Aniston frequently made comments about staying off of social media. She told Vogue in 2017 that she hadn't made any social-media accounts in order to maintain her \"sanity.\"\n\n\"Now you have social media and you've added this extra pressure of seeing if someone likes or doesn't like something you did,\" Aniston told Vogue. \"We're creating these man-made challenges and it's a such a drag.\"\n\nWith all that buildup, it's no surprise Aniston's Instagram debut on Tuesday was monumental. Her first post was a selfie of herself alongside her \"Friends\" costars. Almost immediately, news of Aniston's Instagram debut led to an influx of followers, likes, and comments \u2014 which spurred technical problems and made it difficult for some users to follow Aniston's account.\n\nAdditionally, Aniston's popularity even broke a world record: Guinness World Records said on Wednesday that Aniston had broken the record for the fastest time for an Instagram account to reach 1 million followers, reaching the milestone in just five hours and 16 minutes.", "description": "Aniston revealed on Wednesday that before joining Instagram, she had a secret \"stalker account\" to \"dip my toe into the social-media pool.\"", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9d3904af9092a1c370948?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
