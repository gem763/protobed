Mr Johnson shot back cheerily: \"I know how you feel!\"\n\nBut despite claims Boris Johnson's offering is even worse, she forcefully backed the Prime Minister - saying MPs must back his deal to get Brexit done.\n\nAnd she said MPs who backed triggering Article 50 , only to block the legislation now, would be \"guilty of the most egregious con trick on the British people.\"\n\nThat led from an angry attack from expelled Tory Dominic Grieve. He said it was not a con trick when the deal is \"so utterly different from what was offered\" three years ago.\n\nBoris Johnson barely betrayed a smile as Theresa May forcefully told MPs to back his deal.\n\nThe PM kept his arms tightly folded and looked towards the ceiling in her speech, tapping his arms on his own suit sleeve as she spoke.\n\nBut he did manage a smile when she cracked a joke late in her speech - turning round to look at her.\n\nAnd he nodded when she said MPs must abide by the result of the 2016 referendum.\n\nRising to speak Mrs May was asked if she was going to rebel - at which she and the Tory benches laughed.\n\nMrs May, whose own deal was rejected by Parliament three times replied: \u201cI intend to rebel against all of those who don\u2019t want to deliver Brexit.\u201d\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nIn an angry speech she asked MPs \u201cDo we want to deliver Brexit, do we want to deliver on the referendum of 2016?\u201d\n\nShe asked the House of Commons if the meant their votes to call the referendum and trigger article 50.\n\nShe said: \u201cIf this parliament did not mean it then it is guilty of the most egregious con trick on the British people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard much from the Labour front bench on the importance of protecting jobs, industry and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cIf they really meant that they would vote for this deal tonight.\u201d\n\n(Image: Amer Ghazzal/REX)\n\n(Image: Tom Corban/REX)\n\nIt came as Parliament sat on a Saturday for the first time since 1982 to approve or reject Boris Johnson \u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nAt the same time, tens or hundreds of thousands of protesters were set to descend on Westminster demanding a second referendum \u2013 a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d.\n\nBut the vote risked becoming a total damp squib after MP Oliver Letwin tabled an amendment that will force a delay, win or lose - and put off the final decision until later.\n\nThat prompted No10 to threaten to pull or sit out the vote to avoid handing a symbolic victory to the expelled Tory and his Labour allies.\n\nToday\u2019s vote was already on a knife edge as victory hinged on just a few Labour MPs in Leave seats.\n\nLast night Boris Johnson unveiled a last-minute offer on workers\u2019 rights after his deal watered them down. But it was slammed by Labour\u2019s leadership and the TUC as not worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\n\nBoris Johnson began speaking in the Commons at 9.30am with the final vote expected this afternoon.", "description": "The Prime Minister spoke out to support Boris Johnson's Brexit deal in the strongest possible terms", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Uk Parliament Afp Via Getty Imag", "Amer Ghazzal Rex", "Tom Corban Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653452.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Theresa-May-Brexit-debate.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
