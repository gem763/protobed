If things had not transpired as they had, I would have been found here at my house dead.\"\n\nWhen deputies went to Slaton's house shortly after speaking to the woman, they ordered him to exit the home and arrested him when he complied.\n\nThe paper said according to the report, there was a significant amount of blood on Slaton and throughout the house.\n\nParamedics took him to a hospital where he underwent surgery.\n\nThe newspaper discovered that on the South Carolina Secretary of State online business registry, Slaton's address is listed as the location of a non-profit called Jesus Saves Ministries, and Slaton as its registered agent.\n\nAccording to that listing, the organisation was incorporated in 2011 and remains in good standing.", "description": "The alleged attacker, Dennis Glenn Slaton, is already on the sex offenders' register and needed surgery after police arrived in South Carolina, USA", "authors": ["Chris Murphy", "Kelly-Ann Mills"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758090.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Dennis-Slaton1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
