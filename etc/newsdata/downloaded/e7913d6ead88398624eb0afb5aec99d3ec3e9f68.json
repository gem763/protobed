Almost as if, like Seth Mandel says, it\u2019s Lorne Michaels\u2019s \u201ctransparent attempt to blame-shift and win back some of the credibility he thinks he lost with his viewers.\u201d The show hired someone who turned out to have used a slur, which irritated its audience, and now they\u2019re going to blame the mess on righties by suggesting that they brought Shane Gillis in not because they enjoyed his \u201cproblematic\u201d stand-up material but because they thought benighted conservatives would enjoy it. Because of the slurs, I guess.\n\nEven though obviously he wouldn\u2019t be using any slurs on the show.\n\nAnd even though, if you believe Michaels and the producers, they weren\u2019t aware that his material was \u201cproblematic\u201d until after they hired him.\n\nSonny Bunch pointed out earlier that there\u2019s not a single named or even quoted source in Variety\u2019s entire piece. It\u2019s just \u201csources\u201d feeding them the spin Michaels and SNL want out there to somehow pin this on the three right-wingers who still faithfully watch the show every week.\n\nAccording to sources, the long-running NBC comedy show and series mastermind Lorne Michaels were actively looking to cast a comedian for its new season who would appeal to more conservative viewers. This was meant to counteract the appearance of a liberal bias on the show, given that it has seen a major resurgence in popularity in recent years with Alec Baldwin regularly portraying President Donald Trump while other cast members and guest stars have played members of his administration and those in his orbit. \u201cSNL\u201d typically recruits cast members from improv troupes like The Groundlings, Second City, and The Upright Citizens Brigade, with the belief that even though they may lack onscreen acting experience, their time onstage with those groups would prepare them for the rigors of \u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d weekly schedule. Auditions for such performers usually consist of character bits and celebrity impressions. It is believed that Gillis, who has no credited onscreen acting experience, auditioned using a portion of his stand up routine\u2026 Many of those who spoke with Variety agreed that \u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d vetting process was \u201cseverely lacking\u201d in this case, as Gillis was well-known in comedy circles for using the type of language and remarks that ultimately led to the show cutting ties with him before he ever made it to air.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear what precisely made SNL and Michaels think Gillis would appeal to conservatives,\u201d mused Vanity Fair, adding that the show is so well-known to righties as reliably liberal in its outlook after years of attacking Trump that no single \u201cconservative\u201d addition to the cast was likely to change those perceptions. The detail in the excerpt about Gillis\u2019s lack of experience outside the stand-up format is strange too. There\u2019s no stand-up on the show apart from the opening monologue, which of course is performed by that week\u2019s guest, not the cast members. If Michaels wanted to bring Gillis on as a writer because he liked his material, that would be one thing. But it makes no sense to bring him on as a performer when Gillis has no background in improv or TV and, as far as I know, doesn\u2019t specialize in impressions.\n\nIt makes me wonder if they hired the guy and later had misgivings about how much he\u2019d be used onscreen, realistically. When the controversy over the slur presented itself, that became the excuse for undoing their odd decision.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, he\u2019s gotten support from places you might expect\u2026\n\nDear @Shanemgillis\n\nAs a former SNL cast member I am sorry that you had the misfortune of being a cast member during this era of cultural unforgiveness where comedic misfires are subject to the intolerable inquisition of those who never risked bombing on stage themselves. \u2014 Rob Schneider (@RobSchneider) September 16, 2019\n\n@Shanemgillis Hey, Shane, I'm so sorry. I can't even imagine how you must feel. The work it takes to get that show and to have it snatched away by some guy who does \"Spoken Bird\" poetry. Unacceptable. Please DM me, pal, when you have a moment. I'm so sorry. \u2014 Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) September 16, 2019\n\n\u2026and from places you might not:\n\nLemon and Cuomo on SNL Firing Shane Gillis: \u201cI hate the whole cancel culture\u2026Everyone is a little too sensitive and I think going back in the past for every little thing that someone did, no one would have a job\u201d pic.twitter.com/VngZIttlNI \u2014 ALX \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@alx) September 17, 2019\n\nWhat about the central claim of the piece, though, that Gillis appeals uniquely to conservatives somehow? Is he a southern comic, a la Jeff Foxworthy, or at least a pretend-southern comic like Larry the Cable Guy? No, he\u2019s from Pennsylvania. Watch the clip below and you\u2019ll see that he comes from a town which he describes as \u201cwhite trash,\u201d talks about trying to listen to country music, and jokes that Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign was aimed *exactly* at schlubby white guys like him \u2014 but he\u2019s not sympathetic to any of it. I didn\u2019t vote for Trump, he stresses, and I can\u2019t get into country music. The set has its moments (the Brendan Dassey bit at the end made me laugh, poor taste and all) but there\u2019s nothing that would make you think righties would have any special affinity for him. And again, even if he was more Foxworthy-ish, his duties as a cast member would be to act out comic material that\u2019s mostly written by others. There\u2019s nothing here to make you think he\u2019d have a particularly stellar aptitude for that worthy of broadcast TV. So how\u2019d he get hired?\n\nThere\u2019s profanity here and sex jokes so proceed accordingly if you\u2019re at work.", "description": "Blame.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sg-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
