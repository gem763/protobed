Although I welcome Brexiteers taking data privacy seriously after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, I turned down the contract.\n\nIt is time for more conscientious objectors in the business world. Only by cutting off divisive, racist individuals from the suppliers who make their organisations function can we pressure them into either moderating their views, or disappearing into obscurity.\n\nActivism is not a regular part of my job. As a Privacy & GDPR compliance consultant, I provide an essential service to medium and large organisations who are handling a lot of personal data about the public. Most of the time I\u2019m like any other service provider, giving my expertise to companies across a plethora of sectors without too much concern about their values.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nData privacy is something that every organisation needs to think about \u2013 especially when there are so many laws about what you can and can\u2019t do with data. After the scandals surrounding Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, this is even more important \u2013 particularly to right wing campaign groups and political parties.\n\nWhen I was approached by The Brexit Party recently to help them secure and mine their data for mass marketing, part of me was pleased that they were, unlike the Leave.EU campaign, taking data privacy seriously.\n\nBut once I considered that I was dealing with Nigel Farage\u2019s party, I realised that I could essentially be making the latest incarnation of Cambridge Analytica's work data-compliant and untouchable to regulators. I knew I couldn\u2019t take their tainted money. And tainted money is exactly what it is, with hate crimes in the UK at an all-time high.\n\nIf this makes me sound like a fanatical Remainer, that is only because Farage and his friends have succeeded in making their racist and Islamophobic values synonymous with the movement for Britain to leave the EU.\n\nI am not a party political person, and couldn\u2019t care less whether a client or colleague voted Leave or Remain. But I do care if they hate me because I have a Muslim name, or want to tear the hijab off my mother\u2019s head.\n\nI am all for a rich and varied political discourse, including views with which I disagree. But Farage claiming that 80 million Turks are imminently moving to London, or him describing the continent as being at \u201cbreaking point\u201d because it has received a tiny slice of the world\u2019s 71 million displaced people, is not normal political discourse.\n\nAnd the Brexit Party\u2019s problem is bigger than just Farage: the party\u2019s former leader, Catherine Blaiklock, resigned after it emerged that she tweeted Neo-Nazi material \u201cdozens of times\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that all of the 17.4 million people who voted for Britain to leave Europe hold those beliefs. But they weren\u2019t asking me to help them \u2013 Farage\u2019s party was.\n\nI don\u2019t believe there is any conflict between business and ethics. I care about making a profit and growing my firm, and I also care about having a clear conscience and being able to sleep at night.\n\nThe best businesses have clear values and principles that ground them and allow them to grow. I\u2019d invite my fellow entrepreneurs to think about what they want their businesses to stand for, and take responsibility for living up to that.\n\nAny organisation, whatever it does, can only operate with the co-operation of a plethora of suppliers \u2013 from caterers, to cleaners, to data compliance experts. If more business people choose to boycott those who stand for racism and bigotry, we can create real change that cannot be achieved through retweets and hashtags.\n\nIt was a business boycott that led to the collapse of one of the most longstanding racist systems of the 20th century: apartheid South Africa. Britain might not have a Mandela, but it does have business owners with a conscience, who are willing to stand by their principles \u2013 even if it costs them \u00a330,000.\n\nJamal Ahmed is the founder of Kazient Privacy Experts", "description": "Earlier this month I was approached to help Nigel Farage's Brexit Party with their data privacy and GDPR compliance, for which I would have been paid \u00a330,000.
