Kelly or a Supreme Court Justice like Brett M. Kavanaugh or other Capitol Hill politicians will hardly impact their life in any way, for example. But the juniors and seniors in my theater arts classes look beyond their years. That same day I probed my freshmen, I asked these students to dig into their pasts in search of emotion they could bring forth in their upcoming monologues. Students were quick to reveal traumatic pasts \u2014 middle school bullying, drug addiction, dead parents. But I was surprised at the number of girls who spoke out in an open circle about their sexual assaults. One young woman choked through her words. She cried forcefully, determined to finish her story until the end. Many students got up and hugged her.
