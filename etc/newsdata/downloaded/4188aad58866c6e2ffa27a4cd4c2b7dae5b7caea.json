A bankruptcy court was due to rule on other offers for Aigle Azur later in the day.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be consolidation,\u201d the Air France-KLM chief executive told reporters at a ceremony in Toulouse marking the delivery of Air France\u2019s first Airbus A350 jet.\n\n\u201cWe believe positive results will come out of it, to ensure that airlines that are based here in France will be stronger to compete globally,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe jobs associated with those larger more powerful airlines will be created here in France.\u201d\n\nWhile six airlines currently compete on London-New York routes, the CEO added, the smaller Paris-New York market is contested by 10 rival carriers.\n\nSmith was speaking at the end of a week marked by travel firm Thomas Cook\u2019s failure, which affected 600,000 holidaymakers and send shockwaves across the sector.\n\nA long line of small European airlines have also run into trouble faced with industry overcapacity, cut-throat competition and high fuel prices. Germania, Flybmi and Iceland\u2019s WOW have all failed this year, while Slovenia\u2019s Adria Airways has cancelled almost all its flights this week.\n\nWillie Walsh, CEO of British Airways parent IAG (ICAG.L), has also said that bankruptcies among competitors would help support the group\u2019s growth next year.\n\nSTRANDED\n\nAigle Azur, which stranded 19,000 passengers when it abruptly halted its services earlier this month, operated with 1,150 staff and a fleet of 11 Airbus jets serving Algeria and other destinations in north Africa and beyond.\n\nAir France discussed a joint Aigle Azur bid with Air Caraibes parent Dubreuil Group, but pulled out after concluding that it would require a complex deal with its own unions. EasyJet (EZJ.L) also withdrew an earlier offer.\n\nThe French flag carrier has also resisted entreaties by XL Airways CEO Laurent Magnin to acquire the failed airline, its 570 staff and four Airbus planes.\n\nFranco-Dutch Air France-KLM remains sceptical of the low-cost, long-haul market plied by XL, Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe today the XL model offers something that would complement Air France.\u201d\n\nSmith said absorbing either smaller carrier would have endangered labour relations at Air France, which last year lost 335 million euros ($366 million) to a wave of strikes.\n\n\u201cWe have a stable social environment today in Air France, and we\u2019ve made it clear we\u2019re not going to jeopardise that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe commercial court in Evry, south of Paris, was this week assessing two remaining Aigle Azur bids, from minority shareholder Gerard Houa and a former Air France executive. Both offers are understood to require additional funding from the French state or other backers.", "description": "Air France-KLM boss Ben Smith on Friday defended his decision not to fly to the aid of two collapsed French airlines, and said market consolidation would eventually benefit the country's aviation industry and jobs.", "authors": ["Laurence Frost", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
