(Gif: Cartoon Network)\n\nIt\u2019s been over four years since Steven Universe debuted a new opening sequence showcasing just how much Steven and the Gems have grown and changed. But now that The Movie has warped the Crystal Gems into the future, it makes all the sense in the world that the series\u2019 next season would begin with an updated introduction completed with new mysterious new characters and mysteries.\n\nIn typical Steven Universe fashion, the new opening \u2014 which reveals the show is now officially titled Steven Universe Future \u2014 is short, but it\u2019s so jam-packed with details about Steven Universe\u2019s future (literally!) that it\u2019s worth watching more than a few times.\n\nA new arrangement of \u201cHere We Are in the Future\u201d replaces \u201cWe Are the Crystal Gems\u201d as the series\u2019 signature theme, and it\u2019s finally being sung by the full Crystal Gem team \u2014 the and not just Amethyst, Garnet, Pearl and Steven.\n\nLapis, Peridot and Bismuth have gotten in on the action, but they aren\u2019t alone. Spinel, the Diamonds and a number of other Gems from Beach City\u2019s Little Homeworld are also featured prominently, suggesting that the series is really going to lean into the idea that Earth and Homeworld really have become much, much more intertwined after the events of \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d and Steven Universe: The Movie.\n\nWhat\u2019s most interesting about the new title sequence is the brief shot of the new arc\u2019s villains. Apparently Aquamarine and Jasper still have a bone to pick with the Crystal Gems and they\u2019re set to be joined by a new pair of dark Lapis Lazulis, a Steven-esque cactus monster, some kind of huge Gem monster, and... potentially White Diamond, from the looks of things.\n\nThe new season set to focus on Steven realising that he\u2019s solved basically all of everyone else\u2019s problems meaning that he\u2019s finally got to properly focus on his own baggage without any distractions.\n\nAfter unveiling the new opening sequence this year\u2019s New York Comic Con, Rebecca Sugar also announced that Steven Universe Future is a en epilogue to the the series, meaning that when it premieres some time in the future, it will bring Steven\u2019s epic story to an end.", "description": "It\u2019s been over four years since Steven Universe debuted a new opening sequence showcasing just how much Steven and the Gems have grown and changed.
