'The hearing tomorrow will go ahead.'\n\nHe added: 'But the PM has made the request for an extension he promised he wouldn't make, the EU is considering that request, and the question whether the PM and Advocate General for Scotland are in contempt of court is one for the Inner House.'\n\nWho is the barrister Jolyon Maugham QC and what cases has he brought on Brexit? Jolyon Maugham QC is a remain-backing barrister and newspaper columnist who has been behind a string of legal challenges to Brexit. He backed Gina Miller's High Court battle to force the Government to give MPs a vote on triggering Article 50 and formally triggering Brexit. He spearheaded a campaign to try to mount a legal challenge to see if Brexit can be reversed. He had planned to take the case to the Dublin courts but abandoned it after they signalled they would not refer it to the ECJ. And he is also the brains behind the latest challenge for a group of British expats to try to keep all their EU rights after Brexit. The lawyer is also an occasional columnist for the liberal, Remain-baking Guardian newspaper.\n\nDuring the case's first hearing on October 9, the Government's lawyers assured the court that Mr Johnson would adhere to the law in writing and before the judges \u2013 despite the Prime Minister's repeated public declarations that he would never request an extension.\n\nIf the three judges find Mr Johnson has failed to uphold the law, they could find him in contempt, with potential punishments including a fine or even a jail sentence.\n\nEU Commission president Donald Tusk confirmed at 10pm on Saturday that he had received the Prime Minister's request, tweeting: 'The extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.'\n\nIn his signed letter, Mr Johnson wrote: 'A further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us.'\n\nThe letter, to Mr Tusk and copied to European Council president Jean-Claude Juncker, references his regret at being defeated over the Letwin amendment in the House of Commons on Saturday.\n\nIt states: 'Regrettably, Parliament missed the opportunity to inject momentum into the ratification process for the new Withdrawal Agreement.'\n\nMPs voted by 322 to 306 in favour of amending the Brexit deal in order to withhold the Commons' approval until the necessary UK legislation to leave the EU has been passed.\n\n'The Government's response was to cancel Saturday's vote on the deal, with it expected to be brought back before MPs during the week.\n\nMr Maugham (pictured speaking to pro-EU demonstrators outside the Scottish court on Friday)\n\nJoanna Cherry QC, an SNP MP who has been involved in bringing proceedings to court, described Mr Johnson's actions as a 'childish trick of not signing the letter and sending a contradictory covering letter'.\n\nShe added: 'Our legal team are instructed to remind the court that as well as promising to comply with the letter of the Benn Act, the PM also promised not to seek to frustrate the purpose of the legislation.\n\n'It will be for the court to decide whether his actions in failing to sign the letter of request and sending a letter setting out his contrary intentions are in breach of the undertakings he gave them or a contempt of court.'", "description": "Today a hearing in Edinburgh will resume after the Prime Minister sent a signed letter to the EU saying that a delay would be a mistake as well as an unsigned one requesting an extension.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/07/19967236-0-image-a-17_1571641172429.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
