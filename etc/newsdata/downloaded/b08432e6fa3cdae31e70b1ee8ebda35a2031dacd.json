Americans who value life expect the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to easily pass the Senate today.\n\n\n\n\u201cOpposition to the bill that argues the mantle of \u2018women\u2019s rights\u2019 is deeply flawed because the bill applies to children who are already born and outside their mothers\u2019 wombs. Sadly, a number of politicians bought and paid for by the abortion lobby have become so radicalized that they will vote today to endorse infanticide.\n\n\n\n\u201cDeclaring that some human lives are less worthy because of their stage of development is destructive to our civil society and breeds inhumanity toward others, not just toward the unborn. A fundamental disrespect for the inherent value of other human beings is the seed that gives birth not only to an acceptance of the killing of innocent children, but also to racism, sexism, ageism, and other bigotries. Today is an opportunity to take a step toward ending the rampant devaluing of human life.\n\n\n\n\u201cI commend Leader McConnell for bringing this bill to the Senate floor so that all Americans can see where their senators stand on such a critical, live-saving measure.\u201d\n\n", "description": "WASHINGTON\u2014Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James made the following statement in advance of the Senate\u2019s vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act:", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
