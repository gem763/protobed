This promises to be a typically raucous Old Firm derby at Ibrox. Both teams have started the season superbly, winning their opening three games and playing some eye-catching football in the process. And both will know the significance of victory this afternoon. For Rangers, the hope will be a third consecutive Old Firm victory at Ibrox. Celtic, meanwhile, will be hoping to take an early step towards a ninth successive title. Team News Changes Celtic make a couple of changes from the side that won at AIK in the Europa League in midweek. Fraser Forster replaces Craig Gordon and defender Kristoffer Ajer, injured in Sweden, makes way for Hatem Abed Elhamed. Rangers boss Steven Gerrard, meanwhile, has opted to drop striker Alfredo Morelos, who scored against Legia Warsaw on Thursday night. Jermain Defoe gets the nod instead, while Glen Kamara replaces Sheyi Ojo in the starting XI. Advertisement Some pre-match reading ahead of kick off: Three key talking points ahead of Rangers vs Celtic Rangers boss Steven Gerrard: We have experienced beating Celtic on a couple of occasions and going close to beating them, even at Celtic Park in the second away fixture last season. They are in a good place themselves, they are playing with confidence and scoring heavily. It is set up for a fantastic match. Just because we have more belief and confidence about ourselves doesn\u2019t mean our respect for Celtic changes. We still know they are the team to beat, the team to catch. But if we find a performance close to our maximum, any team that comes to Ibrox is going to find it tough to beat us.\" Celtic boss Neil Lennon: We are in goal-scoring form, we are winning games convincingly, so it's not bad being underdogs with the way we are playing at the minute - I'll take that. We are in powerful form, particularly going forward. The defence is looking like players are getting more familiar with their surroundings.\" The players walk out at Ibrox, greeted by a roar from the capacity crowd. The home fans break into a rendition of Simply the Best. We're almost ready to get underway... Advertisement KICK OFF Celtic kick off and immediately punt the ball into touch deep in Ranger's half. An unconventional start from the visitors. Rangers 0-0 Celtic 2 minutes That bizarre kick off from Edouard actually seemed to work quite well. Celtic gain territory and are quickly on the front foot, probing on the edge of Rangers' box. The hosts have to be alert early on to clear the danger. Rangers 0-0 Celtic 2 minutes Christie has the game's first effort on goal, finding space around 30 yards out and unleashing a powerful shot. It's struck well, but always flying over the bar. Rangers 0-0 Celtic 6 minutes Predictably, it's all a little scrappy in the opening stages. There's plenty of intensity, lots of effort, but not a great deal of quality in the first few minutes. Advertisement Rangers 0-0 Celtic 7 minutes Johnston finds space on the left for Celtic, beating his man and pulling the ball back from the byline. It's blocked behind for a corner, which Rangers clear. Rangers 0-0 Celtic 9 minutes Rangers threaten for the first time, surging forward in numbers. McGregor makes the first of probably many late, hard tackles, cleaning out Arfield. Somehow, he avoids a booking. The hosts try to work the ball into the box but the final ball proves elusive. Rangers 0-0 Celtic 10 minutes A half chance for Rangers from a corner as Katic wins a header a few yards out from goal. He doesn't connect well, though, and the ball sails over the bar. Rangers 0-0 Celtic 13 minutes Rangers are beginning to move the ball nicely now, playing with more confidence after a shaky start. Chances have been scarce so far, though. Advertisement Rangers 0-0 Celtic 16 minutes There's a nasty clash of heads between Elhamed and Flanagan as both players go for the ball. The Celtic man comes off worse, and he's down receiving some treatment from the physio. Rangers 0-0 Celtic 17 minutes Scott Brown is not popular at Ibrox, and a poor challenge from behind on Kamara does nothing to enhance his reputation. He avoids a yellow card, to the fury of the home supporters. Rangers 0-0 Celtic 22 minutes Celtic are content to keep possession of the ball in midfield at the moment, quietening the crowd and preventing any early momentum for Rangers. Rangers 0-0 Celtic 24 minutes Rangers' fans appear to be growing a little frustrated. Celtic are controlling things, knocking the ball around comfortably and looking far more of a threat in the final third.
