You\u2019re not alone...", "language": "en", "text": "Even before the President Trump impeachment inquiry began dominating news coverage and watercooler conversations this week, politics were already costing many Americans their sanity.\n\nUniversity of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln researchers surveyed 800 Americans about the physical, social and emotional effects of today\u2019s often heated and hyper-partisan political discourse.Many respondents reported feeling stressed and losing both friends and sleep as the polarized country heads into a contentious 2020 presidential election.\n\nAlmost 40% said politics had \u201cstressed\u201d them out, and about 32% agreed watching media outlets promoting views opposite their own drove them \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nMany also reported caring \u201ctoo much\u201d about which candidate wins and loses (22%), or spending more time thinking about politics than they would like (26%). Indeed, more than one in four (26%) said they became \u201cdepressed\u201d when their preferred candidate lost.\n\nAnd most alarmingly, 4% said they have had suicidal thoughts. Lead author and political scientist Kevin Smith noted that it\u2019s quite a small proportion, but still a noteworthy one. \u201cThat translate into 10 million adults,\u201d he said in a statement\n\nVoters aren\u2019t just suffering mental and emotional fatigue. About one in five reported losing sleep, and more than 10% complained of non-specific health issues. One in five also said that a friendship had been \u201cdamaged\u201d as the result of a political argument.\n\n\u201cPolitics is really negatively affecting a lot of people\u2019s lives, or at least, they\u2019re perceiving that politics is really negatively affecting their lives in deep and meaningful ways,\u201d added Smith.\n\nThis has been an issue for some time, and it appears to be getting worse. The American Psychological Association\u2019s 2016 \u201cStress in America\u201d survey of 3,400 American adults found that 63% saw the country\u2019s future as \u201ca significant source of stress,\u201d and 56% said they were stressed by the political climate at that time.\n\nBy 2018, the APA reported that the number of people pinning stress on politics had risen to 69%, while those who said the political climate was stressful had jumped to 62%.\n\nStress and anger have also been increasing among Americans, in general; particularly younger people between the ages of 15 and 49, according to a Gallup poll earlier this year.\n\nRead more: Americans\u2019 stress levels just hit a record high \u2014 and this group is suffering the most", "description": "This chart shows how political stress is hurting many Americans.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS139_politi_ZG_20190926111739.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
