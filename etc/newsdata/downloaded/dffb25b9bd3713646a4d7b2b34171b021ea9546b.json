REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nPrime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a toughly-worded letter that Catalan president Quim Torra had \u201cturned his back\u201d on the security forces and he reiterated that Torra should forcefully condemn the unrest.\n\nThe regional government said Torra had requested a meeting with Sanchez during his visit to see security forces in Barcelona, but it was not immediately clear if this would happen.\n\nBarcelona has been hit by seven consecutive nights of sometimes violent protests following the jailing last week of nine Catalan separatists found guilty of sedition over their role in leading a failed 2017 drive for independence.\n\nA small crowd of protesters greeted Sanchez as he arrived, blowing horns and yelling as he walked into the national police headquarters, which has been the focal point of much of the recent violence.\n\nSanchez told Torra that his job as head of the regional government was to protect public safety and ensure a harmonious co-existence between the pro- and anti-secessionist camps.\n\n\u201cYour conduct in the past few days has gone in precisely the opposite direction,\u201d Sanchez said in the letter.\n\nTorra said in a statement at the weekend he had always condemned violence and criticized the prime minister for shunning dialogue.\n\nReplying to Sanchez\u2019s letter on Monday, Torra asked for \u201cdialogue without conditions\u201d. His written response, which was released by his office, made no mention of the violence.\n\nSpanish media reported that Torra tried to talk to Sanchez by telephone on both Saturday and Sunday, but was rebuffed.\n\n\u201cDISRESPECT\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the pro-independence party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), which is allied with Torra\u2019s group, condemned the prime minister on Monday for not talking directly to the Catalan government.\n\n\u201cSanchez is refusing dialogue for the umpteenth time. (This shows) disrespect to the people of Catalonia,\u201d Marta Vilalta Torres said.\n\nSanchez will visit injured police officers and meet security forces, the government said. The interior ministry said on Sunday that 288 police had been hurt in the clashes and 194 people arrested.\n\nThe unrest in Catalonia comes as political parties in Spain gear up for a snap national election on Nov. 10, the second vote this year.\n\nThe issue of Catalan separation has dominated the country\u2019s fractured political debate in recent years and is likely to continue to do so in the run-up to next month\u2019s ballot.\n\nSpain\u2019s main parties have consistently refused to hold an independence referendum in Catalonia, although the ruling Socialists say they are open to dialogue on other issues.\n\nAdding to political tensions, the government announced on Monday that the body of former dictator General Francisco Franco would be exhumed on Thursday from a state mausoleum that the Socialists and others have criticized as a monument to fascism.\n\nAlthough four decades have passed since the end of Franco\u2019s rule, he remains a highly contentious figure in Spain.\n\nThe Catalan separatists have evoked Franco\u2019s name in their criticism of the Madrid government\u2019s handling of the independence crisis.", "description": "Spain's acting prime minister accused Catalonia's pro-seccession president of failing in his duty to ensure public order and peace between pro and anti-indepedence supporters as he visited regional capital Barcelona on Monday following a week of riots.", "authors": ["Joan Faus", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443250670&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0CX", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
