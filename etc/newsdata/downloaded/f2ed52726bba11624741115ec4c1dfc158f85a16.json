A more efficient solution would be to identify the real risks involved with Huawei-supplied equipment and to design good regulatory and business responses.\n\nThree risks are obvious in the application of 5G. First, in a 5G world more data will be moving about, so it will be more difficult to identify malicious data, so opportunities for cyber intrusions will grow. Second, there are risks associated with data flows that involve private information or information of commercial value. Third, there are matters specific to defence. Military systems rely on networks, so there is concern about actions that might disrupt military operations or distort information.\n\nFinding a way to co-operate with China on transformative technology will be difficult in the context of the punch-and-counter-punch environment in which China and the United States now conduct their relationship. This way leads directly to a new global digital divide, a lower degree of integration across the Pacific in these sectors and slower growth for all.\n\nBut another world is conceivable: the path of cooperation.\n\nChina\u2019s concerns in the cyber world are like those of others. China\u2019s Cybersecurity Law, for example, looks a lot like other such laws across the globe, with reference to personal information protection, critical information infrastructure, the security responsibilities of network operators and the security certification of equipment.\n\nGiven an apparent alignment of purpose, there is a conceivable solution where the US engages with its trading partners, including China, to build a new regime that supports common interests.\n\nThe design of this regime would be based on the principles of good public policy, which would be arrived at by addressing a series of questions.\n\nFirst, what are the security risks associated with actions taken by international providers of services and infrastructure? And from where do they originate? Second, what are the options for dealing with these risks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn some cases, the answer will not be policy intervention but new processes or alternative technology provided by the market. Where policy is the answer, then governments most come up with the most efficient and least trade-distorting action.\n\nThis is a risk-based approach to the design of a solution, which the European Union is applying before deciding on its position. Australia and the US also refer to these principles in their policy documents, but with respect to their implementation rather than to their default positions.\n\nInternational cooperation is fundamental to finding an efficient solution. This includes work on the alignment of regulations; the definition of such concepts as personal data and critical information infrastructure; the design of IP protection systems and the institution of principles governing the application of artificial intelligence. The principles driving these processes might also be documented in trade agreements.\n\nArticle 19.15 of the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement provides a model for how to proceed. APEC\u2019s Cross-Border Privacy Rules System applies to data flows across a larger number of countries and more can be encouraged to sign on. Most members of the G20 have signed on to the Osaka Track framework within which there is scope to discuss standard rules relating to cross-border data flows.\n\nIn this recent history there is the core of a solution to a big risk for the trading system. But in our immediate environment, adoption of such measures by key players looks difficult.\n\nIn the meantime, those of a like mind can imagine a new global regime based on good public policy and can cooperate on the design of its elements.\n\nChristopher Findlay is Honorary Professor of Economics at the Crawford School of Public Policy, the College of Asia and the Pacific, The Australian National University.
