(AP) - A Virginia man accused by authorities of sexually assaulting a teenage boy has entered a plea agreement.\n\nWVIR-TV reports 24-year-old Michael Wayne Dill pleaded guilty Friday in Waynesboro to one count of forcible sodomy. The deal calls for Dill to spend a decade in prison.\n\nProsecutors say the teen\u2019s family is pleased with the agreement because it will keep the 15-year-old victim from testifying.\n\nThe Staunton News Leader earlier reported Dill was arrested in January after the teen and his mother spoke with police. The Waynesboro Police Department accused the Raphine resident of raping the teen Jan. 5.\n\nThe TV station reports prosecutors said Dill gave the teen alcohol and marijuana before the attack.\n\nRecords show Dill is at the Middle River Regional Jail. They do not list an attorney.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: WVIR-TV, http://www.nbc29.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Virginia man accused by authorities of sexually assaulting a teenage boy has entered a plea agreement.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
