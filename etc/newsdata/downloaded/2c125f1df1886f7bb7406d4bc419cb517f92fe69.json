We are an independent country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be pulled into this because I understand that my words could impact the elections of the American people,\u201d he added.\n\nZelensky\u2019s comments come as President Trump has said he has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to suggest world leaders probe corruption in other countries, including the activities of the Bidens in Ukraine and China.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as Ukraine,\u201d the president told reporters last week ahead of a visit to Florida to deliver remarks on Medicare.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Hunter Biden\u2019s investment firm locked down a $1.5 billion investment deal with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013.\n\nAsked if Ukraine should also probe the Bidens, the president affirmed: \u201cI would think that if they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation,\u201d before adding, \u201cNobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked; that was a crooked deal, 100 percent.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News reported earlier this year:\n\nBiden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden [$83,000 monthly] as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son\u2019s role.)\n\nMeanwhile, former Vice President Biden has denied he or his son committed any wrongdoing, lashing out at a reporter when asked about the subject last week.\n\nDuring tense exchange at campaign stop in Los Angeles, the former vice president was pressed on whether Hunter Biden\u2019s role on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, posed a conflict of interest while he was in government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a conflict of interest,\u201d Biden scoffed, before raising his voice. \u201cThere\u2019s been no indication of any conflict of interest, from Ukraine or anywhere else, period. I\u2019m not going to respond to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s focus on the problem, focus on this man, what he\u2019s doing, that no president has ever done,\u201d he shouted while pointing his finger at the reporter.", "description": "Ukrainian President Zelensky reiterated Thursday that he felt no pressure to look into allegations of corruption against the Bidens.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Volodymyr-Zelensky-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
