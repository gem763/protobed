But, like Sagan, he has a serious car accident, and then becomes amorously entangled with his mother-in-law.\n\nAt the height of Sagan\u2019s fame in 1957, she crashed her Aston Martin and fell into a coma. The incident did not extinguish her love of cars and, after she recovered, she would drive from Paris to Monte Carlo to gamble at its casino tables.\n\nThe young Sagan was a bisexual hedonist who scandalised Parisian society as the first sparks of the youth revolution began to fly in the late 1950s.\n\nHer son said the novel was typically sarcastic and \u201cSaganesque \u2013 an incredible adventure, sometimes impudent, with a baroque tone\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The novelist loved to drive from Paris to Monte Carlo.

He described the discovery as a \u201cmiracle\u201d amid a series of legal battles over her estate, in which he said Sagan\u2019s property was \u201cseized, sold, given away or acquired in dubious ways\u201d.\n\nThe draft had been so heavily photocopied that the outline of some of the letters were unclear, Westhoff said. In the preface, he reveals he brought the text to Sagan\u2019s editor, who did not want to publish it.\n\nWesthoff decided to work on the book himself, adding missing words and sometimes whole passages where he said corrections seemed necessary, taking care not to change the novel\u2019s style or tone. Four Corners of the Heart ends on a cliffhanger, as Sagan\u2019s text trails off.", "description": "Unfinished story, Four Corners of the Heart, was found by her son after her death in 2004", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Paris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/307ae714bf95323cf43d274f48c4b26e35c5e632/0_24_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=34b56315e29ce23cdce8a1e39e7ad18f", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
