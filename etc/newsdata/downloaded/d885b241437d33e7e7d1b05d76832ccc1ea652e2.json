Don't buy it.", "language": "en", "text": "The worst can happen again. Democrats are embarking on a messy primary, Biden is a ripe Trump target, and any 3rd-party candidate could be a spoiler.\n\nIf you think our president is a \u201cfool\u201d who has \u201clost his mind\u201d and is in the midst of \u201cone the greatest political meltdowns of all time,\" I have some terrible news.\n\nYou\u2019re more confused than Donald Trump has ever been.\n\nAnd if you actually believe that Vice President Mike Pence has any interest in saving anything except his place on the ticket, stop trusting yourself with anything sharper than a giant foam finger.\n\nThe bankruptcy-prone birther is not deteriorating or crumbling. Nope. Sorry. He\u2019s still the same sad, sadistic con man he has always been. And he\u2019s on the verge of luring his opponents into making the mistakes that elected him, all over again.\n\nThe WWE\u2019s tangerine terror only \u201cwon\u201d the presidency because we underestimated him and overestimated the people and institutions that should have stopped him. The need to keep discounting him heading into the 2020 election is his greatest and possibly only asset, and the worst threat to our democracy we\u2019ve faced.\n\nThis nightmare won't end on its own\n\nTrump is actually getting better at the worst things that matter most, like avoiding accountability for high and low crimes, capturing the courts for the far right, and raising hundreds of millions of dollars to \u201ccarpet-bomb\u201d Democrats. The institutions that were supposed to rein him in have done more to restrain his critics than him. Meanwhile, what reigns is the belief that this nightmare is bound to end on its own \u2014 what writer Sarah Kendzior calls \u201cnormalcy bias.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Michael Reynolds/epa-EFE)\n\nBy now, we should know better.\n\nCognitive scientist George Lakoff warned in 2016, \u201cTrump is a master salesman with a history of selling deals good for him but not so good for most others.\u201d But it may be \u201cDilbert\u201d creator Scott Adams, the author of a book that claims Trump is a \u201cmaster persuader,\u201d who nailed Trump\u2019s strategy: \u201cWhen it comes to unfavorability, you don't need to outrun the bear. You only need to outrun your camping buddy.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s passion for kneecapping anything that might hold him accountable has even become clear to his favorite reporter. \u201cA Trump adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said weeks ago that the president, whose own approval ratings have stayed upside down, needs voters to feel negatively not just about his opponents but about longstanding institutions,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman tweeted.\n\nHistoric corruption is now normalized\n\nThere are definitely reasons for Democrats to be optimistic. Too optimistic.\n\nThey won the largest midterm vote margin in the history of the House of Representatives less than a year ago. Their potential 2020 nominees are beating Trump by a \u201chistorically large margin\u201d in recent polls. And Rachel Bitecofer, the academic whose model most accurately predicted the 2018 wave election, sees a likely Electoral College win for the Democrats in 2020.\n\nBitecofer notes that her prediction would only require \u201cmassive restructuring\u201d if there is a \u201csignificant upheaval,\u201d which could include a well-funded third-party candidate and other \u201cdisruptions\u201d like a terrorist attack or a recession. Unfortunately, the chances of a different sort of \u201csignificant upheaval\u201d are trending toward 100% as the most obvious corruption in the history of the presidency is being normalized.\n\nTime's wasting:Democratic debates don't match the moment. Time to get serious about beating Donald Trump.\n\nNormally, when the president\u2019s lawyer tweets \u201cprosecutions will happen\u201d in a reference to the president\u2019s political opponents, it would be national news. Just as normally, you would expect some sort of congressional action when the president essentially asks foreign actors to hack his opponents or offers pardons to both achieve political goals and pay off his donors (as reported by The Washington Post based on unnamed administration officials). Instead, any hope that we\u2019ll even see Trump's tax returns before the election seems to be vanishing.\n\nGetting away with \"it,\" whatever \"it\" is, is Trump\u2019s greatest gift. His second greatest gift is a knack for smearing adversaries as the lowest slime in the cracks of the earth \u2014 in other words, Donald Trump.\n\nThe worst can happen, again\n\nThe current front-runner for the Democratic nomination, with his four decades in the limelight, might provide the perfect bull\u2019s-eye for the president's patented psychological projection. What about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cgaffes,\u201d questionable family business, possible foreign entanglements and history ofrace baiting? Trump will surely ask.\n\nRegardless of who wins their nomination, Democrats are heading into what could be the messiest primary we\u2019ve ever seen. And any of the front-runners would likely draw a third-party protest candidate into the race.\n\nI'm writing from Michigan, where Trump won by fewer than 11,000 votes as Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party pulled in 172,136 votes and Jill Stein of the Green Party got 51,463. I can assure you that a third-party candidate doesn\u2019t have to be well-funded to get Trump elected.\n\nFlashback to 2016:Democrats failed to imagine the worst\n\nMeanwhile, almost nothing has been done to secure our elections against the hacked emails, voter database intrusions and social media manipulation that we saw from Russia in 2016. And Trump continues to try to reward Russian President Vladimir Putin for that interference.\n\nVerily I tell you, the worst can happen, again.\n\nAsk yourself: What good did it do believing the polls in 2016, assuring yourself that this clown was bound to impale himself with a giant rake he stepped on? None.\n\nWe should all be doing what Georgia's Stacey Abrams is doing \u2014 everything we can to ensure every voter gets to the polls. For our greatest threat is underestimating the threat we face.\n\nJason Sattler, a writer based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is a member of USA TODAY\u2019s Board of Contributors and host of \"The GOTMFV Show\" podcast.
