(Malcolm Williams of IDI Group Companies of Arlington)\n\nRiver views have enticed buyers to Old Town Alexandria for years. An addition to the area\u2019s luxury waterfront properties, named Watermark, is under construction there.\n\nMore than half of the condos are already under contract, with prices for the remaining units starting in the $2 million range. The Watermark is under development by the IDI Group Companies of Arlington, founded by Giuseppe Cecchi, a developer of the Watergate complex.\n\nLocated at 205 Strand St., the Watermark has a traditional exterior to blend with the surrounding architecture, and contemporary interiors with open floor plans. Eight of the condos have river views, and a rooftop terrace provides river views for all residents. Other amenities include private storage units on each floor, a parking garage and bike storage. The building also has two ground-floor retail spaces.\n\n[What I love about my home in Old Town Alexandria]\n\nThe primary amenity for residents is the location less than two blocks from shops and restaurants on King Street and the Torpedo Factory art gallery. The Watermark is adjacent to the Waterfront park and the planned Point Lumeley Park.\n\nThe condos range from a 900-square-foot, one-bedroom unit with two bathrooms to a three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit with 2,900 square feet. The units include nine-foot-high-ceilings, wide-plank hardwood floors, oversize windows, heated porcelain tile floors in the master bathroom and Italian cabinets, stainless-steel appliances and quartz counters in the kitchen.\n\nFor more information, click here.", "description": "TOWN SQUARE | The Watermark is adjacent to the Waterfront park and the planned Point Lumeley Park.", "authors": ["Michele Lerner", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ySH5--WiaeN0Vj-JG0RWYZkt6CQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WGHLHZLVAVEENPJRIMOU373X4Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
