Emails he hacked from Stratfor subsequently went to WikiLeaks.\n\nLast week, authorities removed Hammond from a prison in Memphis where he has been serving his sentence. The statement from his supporters says he is in transit and expected to be incarcerated near Alexandria, Virginia.\n\n\u201cGiven the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, we don\u2019t know the nature or scope of the grand jury\u2019s investigation,\u201d the committee said in a statement. Hammond\u2019s supporters say they assume this is the same grand jury that Chelsea Manning refused to testify before, leading to her present incarceration.\n\nThe statement also said there is \u201cno way he would ever testify before a grand jury,\u201d and that his sentence\u2014which could have ended as soon as December 2019\u2014may now be prolonged indefinitely.\n\nA spokesperson for the Eastern District of Virginia declined to comment.\n\nManning, the former Army intelligence analyst who served seven years in prison after sharing hundreds of thousands of government documents with WikiLeaks, is currently incarcerated because of her refusal to answer questions from a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia about WikiLeaks.\n\nHammond\u2019s supporters say they believe he would face questions about the same investigation.\n\nFederal prosecutors in the Eastern District have helmed the Justice Department\u2019s investigation and prosecution of WikiLeaks.\n\nIn May, the DOJ charged WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with violating the Espionage Act for revealing government secrets. The move horrified some free-speech advocates, who noted that it was the first time the U.S. government charged anyone under that law just for publishing material.", "description": "His supporters say that Jeremy Hammond, who took part in the hack of a government intelligence contractor, has been called in by a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia.", "authors": ["Betsy Woodruff", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1350,w_2400,x_300,y_168/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567521169/doj_mmkpus"}
