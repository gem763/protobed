Photo: John Sciulli/Getty Images for Vulture Festival\n\nWe at New York Magazine (and thus Vulture) have known for a long time that Jerry Saltz, our art critic since 2007, is a unique and brilliant writer. He\u2019s the art world\u2019s great explainer, capable of writing in such a way that both the insider-iest insider and the rank amateur come away feeling like they\u2019ve learned something. Jerry\u2019s energetic process of \u201cperforming criticism in public,\u201d as he likes to say, has led him to invent whole new forms of criticism (on social media, in three-sentence reviews, on TV, in close readings of single artworks and not-exactly-artworks to which he gives new aesthetic life). He is especially alive at the intersection of art and politics, which means that he was indispensable in 2017 charting the cultural earthquake of Donald Trump\u2019s election \u2014 anticipated by so few artists and yet so quickly seen as initiating a whole new era, and new role, for art. And this afternoon, the Pulitzer Prize committee acknowledged that role with its 2018 prize for criticism. Although he\u2019s been a finalist for the award twice in the past, this is Jerry\u2019s first win (and New York\u2019s as well). We are delighted, and congratulate him.", "description": "Our irrepressible, one-of-a-kind critic gets the big prize.", "authors": ["The Editors"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/04/16/16-jerry-saltz.w1200.h630.jpg"}
