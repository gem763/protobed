No game service ever launched as many games, and we can't wait for you to play all of that,\" product manager Ann Thai told the Apple media event.\n\nApple also unveiled updates to its iPad tablet and Apple Watch smartwatch, also emphasizing stable or lower prices with cuts to older versions.\n\n\"We think the lower iPhone 11 price point and trade-in program will help promote upgrades, specifically in China, while the Apple Arcade and TV+ offerings will help accelerate services growth,\" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said in a note about Apple.\n\nApple shares ended the formal trading day up slightly to US$216.70, while streaming television rivals Netflix and Disney both finished down about two per cent.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Technology - [CUPERTINO, United States] Apple unveiled its iPhone 11 models Tuesday with a price cut for the most basic models while also laying out plans for streaming and gaming services as it bids to weather the slump in the global smartphone market. .
