Photo: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBoris Johnson is not excelling at his job. The right-wing populist (and nihilist) had a plan to succeed where his predecessor had failed and remove Britain from the European Union come hell or high gas prices. With the U.K. scheduled to crash out of the E.U. on October 31, the prime minister would force his parliamentary opponents to spend much of the preceding month on an unrequested vacation. Specifically, Johnson asked the queen to suspend Parliament for the five weeks between September 12 and October 14. This would leave lawmakers little time to pass legislation forbidding a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit. And by preserving the threat of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d \u2014 which Johnson supports over yet another delay \u2014 his bargaining position during final negotiations with Brussels in mid-October would be strengthened, and a better divorce agreement would be secured. Johnson\u2019s premiership would begin in triumph.\n\nThis plan ran into a few hiccups. Johnson\u2019s power grab alienated many within his own party, and a wave of defections cost his government its majority. Meanwhile, just as pressure makes diamonds, so a limited legislative calendar made for efficient lawmaking: Parliament\u2019s anti\u2013no-deal Brexit majority passed a law prohibiting Johnson from taking that route in short order. As these events unfolded, the prime minister took the extraordinary step of asking Parliament to dissolve his own government, so that a snap election might provide him with the hard-line pro-Brexit majority he lacked. But Johnson proved so paradoxically weak, he couldn\u2019t even persuade Parliament to vote against him. All this left the prime minister at the head of a zombie government, with no mandate from the people\u2019s representatives, and no leverage over the E.U.\n\nAnd then, on Tuesday, the British Supreme Court took a sledgehammer to what remained of Johnson\u2019s legitimacy: In a historic 11-0 ruling, the U.K.\u2019s high court found the prime minister\u2019s suspension of Parliament \u201cwas unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201d As such, \u201cthe prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect.\u201d\n\nJohn Bercow, the Conservative-aligned speaker of the House of Commons \u2014 who attained a measure of international fame in recent weeks for his spirited recitations of the word \u201corder\u201d and his stunning rebuke of Johnson\u2019s suspension of Parliament \u2014 called for Britain\u2019s lawmakers to promptly reassemble.\n\nBercow praised the court\u2019s judges for vindicating \u201cthe right and duty of Parliament to meet at this crucial time to scrutinize the executive and hold ministers to account,\u201d before declaring, \u201cAs the embodiment of our parliamentary democracy, the House of Commons must convene without delay. To this end, I will now consult the party leaders as a matter of urgency.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling was by no means a foregone conclusion. Britain has neither a written constitution nor America\u2019s tradition of judicial review. Thus, it was far from clear that the Supreme Court even had the authority to rule on Johnson\u2019s alleged abuse of one of his office\u2019s accepted powers. A lower court had previously ruled that the judiciary had no say over suspensions of Parliament. And while some observers expected the high court to rule against Johnson, few imagined that its decision would be unanimous.\n\nJohnson expressed his displeasure at the ruling Tuesday, while nevertheless vowing to honor it.\n\n\"I strongly disagree with this judgement, and we will not be deterred from getting on and delivering on the will of the people to come out of the EU on 31 October\"\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson responds to #SupremeCourt ruling that his Parliament shutdown was unlawfulhttps://t.co/xdWZ5LQaNT pic.twitter.com/KedkpORbGO \u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) September 24, 2019\n\nThe practical effect of the court\u2019s ruling is uncertain. After all, Parliament did already find time to tie Johnson\u2019s hands before departing. And to this point, merely adding days to Parliament\u2019s calendar has done little to resolve the body\u2019s intractable divisions over Brexit.\n\nStill, the ruling renders Johnson\u2019s initial Brexit strategy an impressively comprehensive \u2014 and comprehensively humiliating \u2014 failure. Which seems inauspicious for the prime minister going forward.", "description": "In an 11-0 ruling, Britain\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament had been unjustified, and thus, unlawful.
