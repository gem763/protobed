Mr. Bowers was soon launched on a career as a prostitute and purveyor of sexual favors.\n\nHis services were an open secret in Hollywood, particularly among closeted gay men and lesbians, who were compelled by social mores and harsh publicity to keep their romantic lives under wraps. Using the gas station as a front \u2014 and later working as a handyman and bartender at private parties \u2014 Mr. Bowers coordinated countless trysts but said he never collected money for the arrangements.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome called him a pimp, but Mr. Bowers chose to describe himself as a \u201cgentleman hustler.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe in being an outright pimp,\u201d he told CBS Sunday Morning in 2012. \u201cSort of a pimp, but not an outright pimp. There\u2019s a difference, you know.\u201d\n\nHis knowledge of Hollywood was far more intimate than most people\u2019s, yet he remained discreetly in the shadows for decades. When he finally told his story in 2012, the revelations were shocking to a Hollywood that seemed to have no more secrets to tell. Skeptical critics questioned the veracity of his salacious accounts.\n\nMr. Bowers said his sexual adventures, which began long before Pidgeon picked him up in the Lincoln, included encounters with \u201cEddy and Wally,\u201d the Duke and Duchess of Windsor: \u201cLike her husband, she definitely preferred homosexual sex.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Mr. Bowers said he \u201cpreferred the sexual company of women,\u201d he was nothing if not open-minded. He said he took part in threesomes with actresses Lana Turner and Ava Gardner and, separately, with actors Cary Grant and Randolph Scott. (\u201cThe three of us got into a lot of sexual mischief together,\u201d he wrote.)\n\nAt various times, he said was in bed with Vincent Price, Vivien Leigh, Edith Piaf, Tyrone Power, Tennessee Williams, Noel Coward and George Cukor. He said Roy Scherer worked for him at the gas station before he became known as the movie star Rock Hudson.\n\n\u201cI was setting up an average of 15-20 tricks a day,\u201d Mr. Bowers noted in his book, written with Lionel Friedberg. \u201cThis was a 24/7 operation, extending over a period of, say, 30 to 40 years. As for tricks that I performed personally, I was often seeing two or three people a day.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of his most startling but unverifiable claims was of meeting FBI director J. Edgar Hoover at a party of men dressed in drag. Mr. Bowers said the long romance of actors Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy was a sham dreamed up by Hollywood mythmakers. He personally had sex with Tracy, he said, and set up Hepburn with at least 150 women over several decades.\n\nHe also arranged for female companions for male actors Desi Arnaz and William Holden, among others. In the end, he refused to send women to Holden after the actor became a hopeless, unkempt drunk.\n\nDetractors charged Mr. Bowers with exaggeration or outright fabrication, noting that everyone named in his book was safely in the grave.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve kept silent all these years because I didn\u2019t want to hurt any of these people,\u2019\u2019 he told the New York Times in 2012.\n\nAD\n\nHis knowledge of sexual appetites was so vast that sex researcher Alfred Kinsey reportedly consulted Mr. Bowers.\n\n\u201cNot only did I do all the things I said I did in the book,\u201d Mr. Bowers said, \u201cI did even more.\u201d\n\nTyrnauer, a former Vanity Fair journalist, said he was introduced to Mr. Bowers by writer Gore Vidal, who first met Mr. Bowers at the Hollywood gas station in 1948.\n\n\u201cHe was the last link to an almost forgotten era of gay Hollywood and gay America,\u201d said Tyrnauer, whose most recent documentary is \u201cWhere\u2019s My Roy Cohn?\u201d\n\nWhile making the film, Tyrnauer said he spent two years checking sources and interviewing men who had worked with Mr. Bowers as gay prostitutes.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI understand the skepticism,\u201d Tyrnauer said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m a journalist, and I approached the story journalistically. I found anecdotal confirmation for almost everything he said.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDescriptions of houses and backyard swimming pools were verified by photographs and satellite imagery. Mr. Bowers recalled, without prompting, the nickname of one of Grant\u2019s male lovers. Columnist Liz Smith confirmed that Hepburn had an active lesbian love life. Others who were participants in one way or another told Tyrnauer and reporters that the sexual underworld facilitated by Mr. Bowers was, in fact, true.\n\n\u201cWhile it is at times circumstantial evidence,\u201d Tyrnauer said in an interview, \u201csome things were so particular, it was clear that they could not have been made up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nYears later, Mr. Bowers recalled long-gone phone numbers and addresses of customers, all of which he memorized.\n\n\u201cSometimes police would come around, sure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think I never got caught partly because I kept everything in my head. There was no little black book.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGeorge Albert Bowers was born July 1, 1923, in Ottawa, Ill., and grew up on a family farm. During the Depression, his parents divorced, and he moved to Chicago with his mother and two siblings. He got the nickname Scotty because he and a neighbor girl walked a Scottish terrier together and became known as \u201cScotties.\u201d\n\nIn World War II, Mr. Bowers was a Marine Corps paratrooper in the Pacific. He settled in California after the war.\n\nAD\n\nDuring his most active years as a prostitute and as a procurer, he had a long relationship with Betty Keller. (It is unclear whether they were married.) In his book, Mr. Bowers said their daughter, Donna Bowers, died in 1968 after undergoing a botched abortion.\n\nIn 1984, Mr. Bowers married singer Lois Broad, who died in 2018. Survivors include a sister.\n\nMr. Bowers\u2019s life of arranging sexual referrals came to end in the 1980s, when AIDS became prevalent. For years, however, he continued to be privy to Hollywood gossip as a non-drinking bartender at parties and as a raconteur with an endless supply of stories.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere always will be secret life happening,\u201d Mr. Bowers told the Guardian newspaper in 2018. \u201cPeople should do what pleases them and the other person \u2014 some people just please more than a few.\u201d", "description": "From a gas station, he arranged liaisons and worked as a prostitute for gay and straight stars.", "authors": ["Matt Schudel", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kHm5OXXPOICBlFbHimaIaQ0KqfE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H3LJSLHPPQI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
