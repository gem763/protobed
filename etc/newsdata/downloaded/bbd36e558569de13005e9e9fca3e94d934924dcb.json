For example, government representatives assigned to auto maker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., which owns the Volvo brand, will help conduct government relations and information exchanges, according to a report published Friday on the official online news platform of Hangzhou\u2019s home province of Zhejiang.\n\nThe vaguely worded statement didn\u2019t elaborate, and Zhejiang officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Geely confirmed the dispatching of a government official to the company, but declined to comment further. The action appears to affect only Chinese businesses; the statement named only three specific companies, all of which are based in Hangzhou: Alibaba, Geely and beverage giant Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co.\n\nWhile it is unclear to what extent the government presence will affect daily operations at these companies, a commentary published Sunday in a Zhejiang state-run media outlet appeared aimed at calming fears that the government would intervene heavily in the companies\u2019 operations.\n\nThe hand of local governments has in the past \u201cstretched too far, managed too much and taken too much,\u201d the commentary read, adding that the goal of the new measure was to fully respect the will of the companies. The government representatives will be stationed within the companies for one year as part of a pilot program, it said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Hangzhou-based Alibaba said Monday that the online-retailing giant understood the government initiative as an attempt \u201cto foster a better business environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government representative will function as a bridge to the private sector, and will not interfere with the company\u2019s operations,\u201d she said.\n\nEven so, the move to increase oversight of Chinese companies is likely to strengthen a view among some policy makers in the U.S. and the West that Chinese companies, whether state-owned or private, are effectively extensions of the Chinese government.\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, China has been gradually giving more power to the state, increasingly steering investments toward state-owned enterprises rather than private businesses.\n\nLast year, a state-controlled newspaper made public Alibaba founder Jack Ma \u2019s membership in the ruling Communist Party, which generated headlines both domestically and internationally because of Mr. Ma\u2019s status as the country\u2019s most prominent capitalist.\n\nWhile the Communist Party has long established outposts within businesses, a view that Beijing is increasing its influence over private enterprise now underpins Washington\u2019s campaign to persuade other countries to blacklist China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co., arguing that the Shenzhen-based telecommunications giant has no choice but to comply with any orders from Beijing to spy on its customers.\n\nHuawei and fellow telecom-equipment maker ZTE Corp. , another object of American suspicion, have said they would deny any such requests. Beijing officials have said that Chinese companies must follow the law in countries where they operate.\n\nWashington has recently broadened its cybersecurity warnings beyond Huawei and ZTE to include Alibaba, search-engine giant Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. , which operates the WeChat instant-messaging and payments mobile app.\n\n\u201cFirms such as Huawei, Tencent, ZTE, Alibaba and Baidu have no meaningful ability to tell the Chinese Communist Party \u2018no\u2019 if officials decide to ask for their assistance,\u201d Christopher Ford, U.S. assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation, said in a speech this month. \u201cSuch aid may not necessarily occur routinely, but it certainly can occur\u2014and presumably will\u2014whenever the Party considers this useful and cares to demand it.\u201d\n\nChinese companies are required to help the government hunt down criminal suspects and silence political dissent; Alibaba\u2019s campus has a police outpost where employees report suspected crimes, and where police request data from Alibaba for their own investigations. Tech-company executives have said their technology helps make the country safer.\n\n\u2014Lekai Liu and Trefor Moss contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com", "description": "The eastern Chinese technology hub of Hangzhou will assign government representatives to work within 100 local companies in a new indication of the Chinese government\u2019s increasingly close monitoring of private companies.", "authors": ["Stu Woo", "Stu.Woo Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109794/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
