He was taken off at half time amid reports of stomach problems and being sick in the dressing room.\n\nHe missed training on Wednesday and Thursday and seems likely to miss out on Saturday\u2019s visit of Granada.\n\nThibaut Courtois was blamed for both goals in the Champions League draw with Club Brugge\n\nOn Tuesday he was whistled by some of the club\u2019s supporters who blamed him for both goals\n\nCOURTOIS STATS 19/20 Appearances: 8 Goals conceded: 11 Clean sheets: 2 Minutes played: 675\n\nUnsubstantiated reports, that were dismissed by Real on Friday, even spoke of anxiety playing a part in problems he had at half-time in the Bernabeu when he could not continue in goal and Alphonse Areola came on.\n\nBut on Friday he told Marca: \u2018If you want to be Real Madrid goalkeeper you have to accept the pressure.\u2019\n\nThe quote was part of a three page special dedicated, in simple terms, to sticking up for the 27-year-old who has looked a shadow of the brilliant young goalkeeper who so impressed the last time in Spain for Atletico Madrid from 2011 to 2014.\n\nThe Marca report stated clearly: \u2018He has absolutely no problem with anxiety\u2019, went on to say he lost three kilos in a matter of hours because of acute gastroenteritis and reminded readers he is on the verge of breaking a record of not conceding a goal for Belgium.\n\nTuesday night\u2019s draw with Brugge was tough on Courtois. The goals he conceded were unlucky with Emmanuel Dennis first mis-controlling the ball past him to put his team 1-0 up.\n\nCourtois had reacted to the Nigerian forward\u2019s likely first-time finish. He was already on the ground when Dennis\u2019s shinned the ball past him with a second clumsy touch.\n\nAt Real Madrid he has already let in 59 goals in 43 games with a ratio of 1.37 goals a game\n\nHe arguably went to ground too quickly for the second but the mistake was more Luka Modric\u2019s who gave the ball away in the build-up. But as the last man he got to carry the can for both goals and the unforgiving Bernabeu whistled him late in the first half.\n\nStatistics published by Diario AS on Thursday suggested his numbers are not what they were the last time he graced La Liga as Atletico Madrid keeper.\n\nThey also don\u2019t match up to what he achieved in London with Chelsea, or at Genk.\n\nAccording to AS, Courtois conceded 152 goals at Chelsea giving him a ratio of 0.99 goals conceded a game. At Atletico it was 125 goals in 154 games giving him a ratio of 0.81 goals a game. And at Genk it was 49 goals in 45 games giving him a ratio of 1.09 goals a game. At Real Madrid he has already let in 59 goals in 43 games with a ratio of 1.37 goals a game.\n\nBut it\u2019s also true that, as Marca pointed out on Friday, of the 11 goals he has conceded this season 10 have been from inside the area. \u2018He is a victim of rivals arriving too easily,\u2019 it argued.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that for Belgium Courtois has only conceded 50 goals in 76 games with a ratio of just 0.65 goals a game. Roberto Martinez was watching on Tuesday and spoke with his player after the match.\n\nBelgium goalkeeping coach Erwin Lemmens was quoted in midweek as saying Courtois could be suffering from \u2018De Gea syndrome\u2019.\n\nEmmanuel Dennis was fortunate to beat the Belgian for the first goal at the Bernabeu\n\n\u2018The goals [on Tuesday] are very strange,\u2019 he told Radio Marca. \u2018The first goal is very difficult to explain.\n\n\u2018Courtois is a special lad and it is very strange that he is always at his best for us and here [in Madrid] he may have De Gea syndrome.\n\n\u2018If the Bernabeu whistle, you have to look at the team as a whole.\u2019\n\nAsked if Courtois should be in the team on Saturday against Granada Lemmens added: \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t he be. He was sick on Tuesday and that\u2019s why the team changed in the second half.\n\n\u2018He is a great keeper and we will try to send him back happy from international duty.\u2019\n\nLemmens\u2019 \u2018De Gea syndrome\u2019 comment suggests a very talented keeper suddenly making mistakes, although the big difference is that De Gea\u2019s form stayed solid for his club long after he began making errors at international level, in the end losing his place to Kepa Arrizabalaga.\n\nCertainly it\u2019s true that Courtois\u2019s form has taken a downward turn and not only does he compare badly with himself in other eras \u2014 only 28 per cent of his matches have ended with a clean sheet at Madrid; it was 38 per cent at Chelsea, 49 per cent at Atletico and 31 per cent at Genk \u2014 but he compares badly with other Real Madrid keepers.\n\nMarca published a three page special dedicated, in simple terms, to sticking up for Courtois\n\nKeylor Navas\u2019 record was 159 goals in 162 games (0.98 goals a game) and Iker Casillas's was 750 in 725 games (1.03 goals a game).\n\nBut one Marca editorial on Friday urged critics to look beyond the numbers. Comparisons with Navas are certainly hard for him.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Navas is yet to concede in the Champions League where PSG are top of Real Madrid\u2019s group. Again luck plays a part because both Benzema and Bale scored past Navas but had their goals were ruled out.\n\nZidane never wanted Navas sold. It could be argued he is not the greatest judge of goalkeepers because he also blocked Madrid\u2019s attempts to sign Kepa.\n\nThere seems little doubt over Courtois\u2019 talent but for now he seems out of luck and out of form.\n\nAs Lemmens hinted at, what he needs now may well be a spell in the friendlier environment of the Belgium national team where he will not be whistled.\n\nFor that reason it seems he will sit out the Granada game on Saturday and be back for three away games against Mallorca, Galatasaray and Barcelona. Real Madrid hope by the time he is back in the Bernabeu on October 30 events of this week will have been completely forgotten.\n\nLa Liga's other games this week\n\nFriday\n\nReal Betis v Eibar (8pm) - FreeSports\n\nReal Betis will be determined to bounce back after being thrashed 5-1 by Villarreal in their last game.\n\nEibar, meanwhile, will be full of confidence after getting the better of Sevilla and Celta Vigo.\n\nFabian Orellana of Eibar, who can play out wide or as an attacking midfielder, is a player to watch out for.\n\nEibar's Fabian Orellana could pose significant problems for the Real Betis defence on Friday\n\nSaturday\n\nLeganes v Levante (12pm) - Premier 1\n\nBoth of these sides have taken just two points from their last four La Liga games, so they will both be especially determined to win this clash.\n\nLevante are the favourites to prevail, with Leganes rock bottom of the table and still without a win in La Liga this season.\n\nIf there is any hope for Leganes it is likely to be provided by Oscar Rodriguez, who has two goals in his last three games.\n\nValencia v Alaves (5.30pm)\n\nJust one point separates these two teams in the table ahead of their meeting at the Mestalla.\n\nValencia have been underwhelming and their confidence was knocked further by a 3-0 loss at home to Ajax in the Champions League.\n\nMaxi Gomez has been in good goalscoring form for Valencia, however, finding the net three times so far this campaign.\n\nMaxi Gomez has been impressive for Valencia and will be eager to add to his tally\n\nOsasuna v Villarreal (8pm) - Premier 2\n\nOsasuna have drawn five of their last six league games, but Villarreal should have enough quality to get the better of them.\n\nVillarreal are looking to move into the top six and could achieve that objective that weekend if other results go their way.\n\nAfter losing to Barcelona, Villarreal responded in style last weekend by thrashing Real Betis, and Gerard Moreno is the leading scorer in La Liga with six goals.\n\nSunday\n\nReal Mallorca v Espanyol (11am) - Premier 1\n\nPerhaps it is too early to describe this game as a relegation battle, but it does appear that both of these sides are in danger of going down this season.\n\nThey have scored just eight goals between them in La Liga, so don't expect this to be a high-scoring affair.\n\nA draw seems the most likely result, but such an outcome wouldn't do much for the confidence of either side.\n\nEspanyol have struggled in La Liga but they did beat CSKA Moscow in the Europa League\n\nCelta Vigo v Athletic Bilbao (1pm) - Premier 1\n\nAthletic Bilbao are just adrift of the top six, while Celta Vigo are teetering precariously above the relegation zone.\n\nRaul Garcia has caught the eye for Bilbao, with the experienced star having scored four times in La Liga.\n\nCelta must be more clinical in front of goal if their fortunes are to improve, but there seems little chance of that happening against Bilbao.\n\nReal Valladolid v Atletico Madrid (3pm) - Premier 1\n\nAtletico Madrid have the chance to put further pressure on the other sides at the top when they travel to take on Valladolid.\n\nIt is widely expected that Atletico will prevail, with Valladolid did manage to take all three points against Espanyol last weekend.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly for a Diego Simeone side, Atletico have managed to keep clean sheets in each of their last four games across all competitions.\n\nAtletico Madrid forward Joao Felix will be eager to score again when his side face Valladolid\n\nReal Sociedad v Getafe (5.30pm) - Premier 1\n\nAfter making an encouraging start to the season, Real Sociedad will be hopeful of getting the better of Getafe, who are in 16th place.\n\nSociedad have been one of the most exciting teams to watch in Europe so far this season, with Martin Odegaard amongst their star performers.\n\nGetafe, meanwhile, have just one win so far this season and will have their work cut out to take anything from this game.\n\nBarcelona v Sevilla (8pm) - Premier 1\n\nAfter some inconsistent form earlier in the campaign, Barcelona have now won their last three games across all competitions.\n\nThey will need to be at their best, however, to get the better of a Sevilla side that are level on points with them in the table.\n\nExperienced winger Nolito scored against Real Sociedad last weekend and will pose a threat to the Barcelona defence.", "description": "PETE JENSON IN SPAIN:  After Thibaut Courtois suffered one of the worse weeks of his career, who should be in goal at the Santiago Bernabeu has been cast in doubt once more.", "authors": ["Pete Jenson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/11/19293078-0-image-a-85_1570185483132.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
