It's frustrating to see it happening day after day,' Mr Bowen said.\n\nHe said that better enforcement from police would help make drivers more aware of the rule.\n\nHe said that on several occasions where people blocked the roads, the police didn't seem particularly 'fussed'.\n\n'It would make a lot of sense for enforcement to stop it because it makes the traffic far worse than it needs to be,' he said.\n\n'It does cause problems for all road users including pedestrians.'\n\nHe said that while everyone was in a rush to get to places, it was 'no excuse' to stop traffic.\n\nVictoria Police handed out more than 300 notices for breaching the rule last year.\n\nIf drivers break the rule, they could be slapped with a $161 fine.", "description": "In Victoria it's illegal for motorists to travel through an intersection if it's blocked, forcing pedestrians to walk onto road lanes  and preventing other traffic flow.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/07/19725986-0-image-a-28_1571120165658.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
