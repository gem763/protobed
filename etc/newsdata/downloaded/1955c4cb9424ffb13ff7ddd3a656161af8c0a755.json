Absolutely none. If you asked me what size my thumbs are, I would say, \u201cYes, correct, I have thumbs!\u201d Obviously, I have seen many other thumbs in my time on this planet, but my frame of reference for how big a thumb should be is modelled on the very thumbs that God gave me \u2014 the ones that I have had for my entire life. This might not be the case for 20-year-old student Jacob Pina, who must surely look at his own thumbs and instinctively know that something strange is going on.\n\nThis might sound like kind of a mean thing to say about a person, but this is just objectively true, as you can see for yourself:\n\nAs he himself describes in the hashtags on his posts, the thumb is indeed \u201c#long\u201d and \u201c#weird\u201d. The thumb has managed to garner Pina not inconsiderable fame on Tik Tok, where he has amassed over 156,000 followers (although I\u2019m sure his personality or whatever has something to do with it as well).\n\nHow much content can you make out of having a long thumb, you ask? Heaps, it turns out:\n\nPina told Metro that it surprises people sometimes but otherwise it\u2019s a pretty chill existence, having big-ass thumbs: \u201cWhen people see my thumb, they freak out and measure it next to their own thumb, I feel great about it. It\u2019s always great to be different and embrace your own essence.\u201d\n\nAnd sometimes, apparently, that \u2018essence\u2019 is having just the biggest goddamn thumb anyone has ever seen.
