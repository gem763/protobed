REUTERS/Njeri Mwangi\n\nBut Chande is parked on the tarmac, caught up in a snarl of red tape. He is in a long line of trucks waiting for cargo to be scanned or for documents to be checked by officials.\n\nKenya and Tanzania are the two largest economies in the East African Community (EAC) common market. It was set up in 2010 to allow people and goods to move freely among members, which also include Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.\n\nOne of the most successful of Africa\u2019s many trade blocs, it should be superseded by a continent-wide free trade area that will begin trading in July next year. But businessmen say the delays plaguing the East African union bode ill for the future of the unified market.\n\n\u201cSometimes we get to the border crossing and spend five, six days or even a week,\u201d said Chande, who said he\u2019d been waiting there more than a day.\n\nBehind him, police pried apart shouting drivers as hundreds of trucks slowly belched and groaned towards the Kenya-Tanzania border in Namanga town.\n\nKenyan and Tanzanian officials say that even in a free trade area, goods crossing borders must be checked by multiple agencies including the tax authorities, plant health inspectorate, departments of human health, livestock control and forestry. This takes time.\n\nBusinesses say that trade moves more smoothly between other EAC countries, for example between Rwanda and Uganda. But their focus is on Kenya and Tanzania as they account for about a two-thirds of the zone\u2019s economic output and similar delays could easily happen between large African economies elsewhere.\n\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area deal will come into force in July and aims to bring together 55 countries, 1.3 billion people and $3.4 trillion nominal gross domestic product to establish the world\u2019s biggest free trade bloc. [nL8N2493AS]\n\nIt will supersede existing trade zones - EAC, ECOWAS in the west, SADC in the south and COMESA in the east and south.\n\nOnly the EAC has made significant progress towards a common market and Gerrishon Ikiara, a Kenyan economist specialising in development and policy, says it should be the role model.\n\nBut although intra-EAC trade grew rapidly at first it now only accounts for 10% of the 6 countries\u2019 total merchandise trade, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) said in a 2019 report.\n\nThis means most exports and imports are with countries outside the bloc. The WTO said poor infrastructure and the use of different currencies were barriers to trade within the EAC.\n\nBusinessmen say the continent-wide deal provided few details of how to make trade run more smoothly and failed to tackle some contentious issues.\n\nIt did not give a time frame for removing existing customs structures, outline how to integrate markets or phase out protectionism, said Ian Gibson, deputy managing director of Farmers Choice, Kenya\u2019s biggest meat processor.\n\n\u201cThe detail is what causes all the chaos,\u201d he said.\n\nTRADE TENSIONS\n\nNamanga is the mid-point of a $200 million highway built in 2012 to connect the Tanzanian city of Arusha with Nairobi\u2019s industrial satellite town of Athi River. The African Development Bank funded the road to promote regional integration.\n\nBut despite the cash poured into infrastructure, Kenya\u2019s annual exports to Tanzania dropped by more than a third since 2014, to 29.75 billion Kenyan shillings ($288 million), the Kenyan statistics office said. Imports from its neighbour also slowed slightly to 17.82 billion shillings over the same period.\n\nCapitalist Kenya and Tanzania, which was socialist for decades and feared domination by its bigger neighbour, have long had an uneasy relationship.\n\nSimilar tensions can be found elsewhere in Africa, and could get in the way of the new free trade deal. Nigeria, the continent\u2019s largest economy, was slow to sign the agreement because businesses are worried that the size of their market makes it especially attractive to foreign competition.\n\nBetween Tanzania and Kenya, tensions spilled over into trade. In 2017, Tanzania burnt 6,500 chicks imported from Kenya over disease fears. More chicks were incinerated last year after the Tanzanian authorities said the Kenyan exporter lacked documents.\n\nTanzania also imposed an unexpected \u201clivestock tariff\u201d on Kenyan meat products. Exports to Tanzania from the Farmers\u2019 Choice meat processing plant in Nairobi plunged.\n\n\u201cHalf our largest export market disappeared overnight,\u201d said Gibson.\n\nKenya\u2019s President Uhuru Kenyatta flew to the rural home of Tanzanian President John Magufuli in July for a charm offensive.\n\n\u201cChallenges between us and our neighbours have reduced over the years, there have been a lot of diplomatic efforts,\u201d Peter Munya, Kenya\u2019s trade minister, told journalists.\n\nCUSTOMERS WAITING\n\nBut the delays persist. Tanzanian truckers say Kenyan police delay them for minor traffic violations that can be circumvented by offering \u201ckitu kidogo\u201d - Swahili for \u201csomething small\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey just harass you and use that opportunity to demand bribes,\u201d said Chande.\n\nThe Kenyan police did not respond to requests for a comment.\n\nOther drivers said Kenya\u2019s tax authorities operate slowly.\n\nTanzanian truck driver Hamisi Gabriel said he sometimes spends several nights stuck at the border.\n\nThe Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) said all cargo in Namanga was cleared in 5 to 7 hours. Tanzanian officials did not respond to requests for comments on border delays.\n\nKibiti Kimiri, general manager of Kensalt, Kenya\u2019s biggest salt manufacturer said it normally takes a week for his cargo to cross the border into Tanzania.\n\n\u201cThe customer on the other side is waiting,\u201d he said.\n\n($1 = 103.2000 Kenyan shillings)", "description": "The speed limit is 110 km per hour on the new highway that Abadalla Chande uses to haul his truckload of animal feed from Tanzania to Kenya, two nations that share a common market often hailed as a model for the continent.", "authors": ["Duncan Miriri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434150952&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P159-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
