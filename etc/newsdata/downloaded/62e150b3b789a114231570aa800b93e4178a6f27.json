As she spoke, a handgun was holstered at her side.\n\n\"I have four children, I am 5-foot-0, 100 pounds, cannot really defend myself with a fist. ... I want to know how you're going to legislate that because a criminal by [definition] breaks the law, so all you're going to do is restrict law-abiding citizens, like myself,\" she told O'Rourke.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBoebert also had a message for President Trump during her appearance on \"Fox & Friends.\" \"Our current administration absolutley needs to take a stand now, today and say we will honor the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States,\" she said.\n\n\"We support our president.
