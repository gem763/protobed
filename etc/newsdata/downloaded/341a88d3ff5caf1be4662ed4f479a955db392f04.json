The islands had previously been seen on satellite images but the expedition was the first to see them.\n\nIt also said it had also confirmed the existence of an island that had been previously mapped as a peninsula of Hall Island, part of the Franz Josef Land archipelago, west of Novaya Zemlya.\n\nMoiseyev said names for the new islands were \u201cupcoming\u201d.\n\n\u201cOf course each island will receive a name but first you have to lay out the case for it,\u201d he said.", "description": "Russian navy discovers yet-to-be-named islands previously hidden under glaciers", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Moscow", "Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33b08778fba0b8031930cd7f9ea9e759e19395b4/0_11_4640_2784/master/4640.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a2bb9bb50bd359d915f276da8e3b49c", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
