Lately, this split has reached new extremes.\n\nIn the critics\u2019 view, we live in an increasingly illiberal age, populated by dangerously erratic strongmen. Leading examples include President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who at the United Nations this week defiantly defended his government against charges that it is turning a blind eye as the Amazon burns; President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whose tough, military-backed regime has been the target of protests over the past week; and Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, widely reviled for the assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives.\n\nYet global investors view the same trio as promising economic reformers, following a mainstream playbook that could have been written (indeed sometimes is written) by analysts at the International Monetary Fund. Markets reward them accordingly. For much of their recent tenures, Brazil under Mr. Bolsonaro and Saudi Arabia under Prince Mohammed have all ranked among the world\u2019s hottest stock markets. Until this week, this year\u2019s top-performing market was Egypt.\n\nThe harsh reality is that markets are amoral, instinctively neutral barometers of economic performance, and they will at times ignore the brutality and excesses of strongmen for a simple reason: Facing little or no resistance from legislatures, courts or independent watchdogs, strongmen can push through sweeping reforms \u2014 particularly in emerging economies, where political institutions and the rule of law are relatively weak. Looking at the records for 150 countries between 1950 and 2010, I found 43 cases in which an economy grew at an annual pace of 7 percent or more for a full decade. An astonishing 35 of those economies \u2014 more than 80 percent of them \u2014 were run by an autocrat.", "description": "Markets are amoral and won\u2019t complain about autocratic behavior if it produces economic growth.", "authors": ["Ruchir Sharma"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/opinion/27sharma/27sharma-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
