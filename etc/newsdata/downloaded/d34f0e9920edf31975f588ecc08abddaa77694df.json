So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in PC Partner Group Limited (HKG:1263).\n\nDo Insider Transactions Matter?\n\nIt is perfectly legal for company insiders, including board members, to buy and sell stock in a company. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.\n\nWe don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. As Peter Lynch said, 'insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.'\n\nSee our latest analysis for PC Partner Group\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PC Partner Group\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Co-Founder, Fong Wong, for HK$2.5m worth of shares, at about HK$2.52 per share.
