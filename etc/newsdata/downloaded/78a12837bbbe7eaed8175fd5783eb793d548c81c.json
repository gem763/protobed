For years, as they failed to find him, American leaders have said that he was more symbolically important than operationally significant because he was on the run and hindered in any meaningful leadership role. Yet he remained the most potent face of terrorism around the world, and some of those who played down his role in recent years nonetheless celebrated his death.\n\nGiven Bin Laden\u2019s status among radicals, the American government braced for possible retaliation. A senior Pentagon official said late Sunday that military bases in the United States and around the world were ordered to a higher state of readiness. The State Department issued a worldwide travel warning, urging Americans in volatile areas \u201cto limit their travel outside of their homes and hotels and avoid mass gatherings and demonstrations.\u201d\n\nThe strike could deepen tensions with Pakistan, which has periodically bristled at American counterterrorism efforts even as Bin Laden evidently found safe refuge on its territory for nearly a decade. Since taking office, Mr. Obama has ordered significantly more drone strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, stirring public anger there and prompting the Pakistani government to protest.\n\nWhen the end came for Bin Laden, he was found not in the remote tribal areas along the Pakistani-Afghan border where he has long been presumed to be sheltered, but in a massive compound about an hour\u2019s drive north from the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. He was hiding in the medium-sized city of Abbottabad, home to a large Pakistani military base and a military academy of the Pakistani Army.\n\nThe compound, only about a third of a mile from the academy, is at the end of a narrow dirt road and is roughly eight times larger than other homes in the area, but had no telephone or Internet connections. When American operatives converged on the house on Sunday, Bin Laden \u201cresisted the assault force\u201d and was killed in the middle of an intense gun battle, a senior administration official said, but details were still sketchy early Monday morning.\n\nThe official said that military and intelligence officials first learned last summer that a \u201chigh-value target\u201d was being protected in the compound and began working on a plan for going in to get him. Beginning in March, Mr. Obama presided over five national security meetings at the White House to go over plans for the operation and on Friday morning, just before leaving Washington to tour tornado damage in Alabama , gave the final order for members of the Navy Seals and C.I.A. operatives to strike.\n\nMr. Obama called it a \u201ctargeted operation,\u201d although officials said one helicopter was lost because of a mechanical failure and had to be destroyed to keep it from falling into hostile hands.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to Bin Laden, three men were killed during the 40-minute raid, one believed to be his son and the other two his couriers, according to an American official who briefed reporters under White House ground rules forbidding further identification. A woman was killed when she was used as a shield by a male combatant, the official said, and two others wounded.\n\n\u201cNo Americans were harmed,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThey took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.\u201d Muslim tradition requires burial within 24 hours, but by doing it at sea, American authorities presumably were trying to avoid creating a shrine for his followers.\n\nThe whereabouts of Ayman al-Zawahri , Al Qaeda\u2019s second-in-command, were unclear.\n\nBin Laden\u2019s death came nearly 10 years after Qaeda terrorists hijacked four American passenger jets, crashing three of them into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon outside Washington. The fourth hijacked jet, United Flight 93, crashed into the Pennsylvania countryside after passengers fought the militants.\n\n\u201cThis is important news for us, and for the world,\u201d said Gordon Felt, president of the group, Families of Flight 93. \u201cIt cannot ease our pain, or bring back our loved ones. It does bring a measure of comfort that the mastermind of the September 11th tragedy and the face of global terror can no longer spread his evil.\u201d\n\nThe mostly young people who celebrated in the streets of New York and Washington saw it as a historic moment, one that for many of them culminated a worldwide manhunt that started when they were children.\n\nVideo\n\nSome climbed trees and lampposts directly in front of the White House to cheer and wave flags. Cigars and noisemakers were common. One group started singing, \u201cOsama, Osama, hey, hey, hey, goodbye.\u201d\n\nMaureen Hasson, 22, a recent college graduate working for the Justice Department, came down to Lafayette Square in a fuchsia party dress and flip-flops. \u201cThis is full circle for our generation,\u201d she said. \u201cJust look around at the average age here. We were all in middle school when the terrorists struck. We all vividly remember 9/11 and this is the close of that chapter.\u201d\n\nSam Sherman, 18, a freshman at George Washington University originally from New York, also rushed down to the White House. \u201cThe feeling you can\u2019t even imagine, the feeling in the air. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI have friends with parents dead because of Osama bin Laden\u2019s plan, O.K. So when I heard this news, I was coming down to celebrate.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Adm. Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , publicly criticized the Pakistani military two weeks ago for failing to act against extremists allied to Al Qaeda who shelter in the tribal areas of North Waziristan. Last week, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , head of the Pakistani Army, said Pakistan had broken the back of terrorism on its territory, prompting skepticism in Washington.\n\nMr. Obama called President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan to tell him about the strike after it was set in motion, and his advisers called their Pakistani counterparts. \u201cThey agree that this is a good and historic day for both of our nations,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nThe city of Abbottabad where Bin Laden was found has had other known Al Qaeda presence in the past. A senior Indonesian militant, Umar Patek, was arrested there earlier this year. Mr. Patek was protected by a Qaeda operative, a clerk who worked undercover at the main post office, a signal that Al Qaeda may have had other operations in the area.\n\nThe Pakistani military cordoned off the roads and alleys leading to the compound Monday. But residents of the middle-class area who were reached by phone said they had not been suspicious about the residents of the house, despite its size and the fact that very few people ever seemed to leave the compound.\n\nAs the operation\u2019s start approached, many American officials at the United States consulate in Peshawar, the capital of the northwest area of Pakistan, were told suddenly to depart last Friday, leaving behind only a core group of essential staff. The American officials said they had been told to leave because of fears of kidnapping but were not tipped off to the operation.\n\nAnalysts said Bin Laden\u2019s death amounted to a double blow for Al Qaeda, after its sermons of anti-Western violence seemed to be rendered irrelevant by the wave of political upheaval rolling through the Arab world.\n\n\u201cIt comes at a time when Al Qaeda\u2019s narrative is already very much in doubt in the Arab world,\u201d said Martin S. Indyk , vice president and director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution . \u201cIts narrative was that violence was the way to redeem Arab honor and dignity. But Osama bin Laden and his violence didn\u2019t succeed in unseating anybody.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAl Qaeda sympathizers reacted with disbelief, anger and in some cases talk of retribution. On a Web site considered an outlet for Qaeda messages, forum administrators deleted posts by users announcing Bin Laden\u2019s death and demanded that members wait until the news was confirmed by Qaeda sources, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, an organization that monitors radicals.\n\nEven so, SITE said, sympathizers on the forum posted messages calling Bin Laden a martyr and suggesting retaliation. \u201cAmerica will reap the same if the news is true and false,\u201d said one message. \u201cThe lions will remain lions and will continue moving in the footsteps of Usama,\u201d said another, using an alternate spelling of Bin Laden\u2019s name.\n\nIn the United States, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy organization, said it welcomed Bin Laden\u2019s death. \u201cAs we have stated repeatedly since the 9/11 terror attacks, Bin Laden never represented Muslims or Islam,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, in addition to the killing of thousands of Americans, he and Al Qaeda caused the deaths of countless Muslims worldwide.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama called to inform his predecessor, George W. Bush , who started the war against Al Qaeda after Sept. 11, yet was frustrated in his efforts to capture Bin Laden \u201cdead or alive,\u201d as he once put it. Mr. Bush released a statement saying, \u201cthis momentous achievement marks a victory for America, for people who seek peace around the world, and for all those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fight against terror goes on, but tonight America has sent an unmistakable message: No matter how long it takes, justice will be done,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Obama used similar language and warned that the war against terrorists had not ended. \u201cWe will be relentless in defense of our citizens and our friends and allies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be true to the values that make us who we are. And on nights like this one, we can say to those families who have lost loved ones to Al Qaeda\u2019s terror, justice has been done.\u201d\n\nThe president was careful to add that, as Mr. Bush did during his presidency, the United States is not at war with Islam. \u201cBin Laden was not a Muslim leader; he was a mass murderer of Muslims,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIndeed, Al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries, including our own. So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity.\u201d", "description": "President Obama said Osama bin Laden had been killed in a firefight during a \u201ctargeted operation\u201d that Mr. Obama ordered in Pakistan.
