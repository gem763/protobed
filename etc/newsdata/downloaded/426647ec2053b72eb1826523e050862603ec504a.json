It was amazing.\n\n(Image: Rebecca Grant)\n\n(Image: Rebecca Grant)\n\n\"Then Nikki came to pick it up. She enscapulated it using a Chinese medical method , then two days later a beautiful package arrived.\n\n\"It was really beautifully presented and you just didn't think about the fact you were eating your own placenta.\n\n\"I had no baby blues this time round. I'm producing a play for the London theatre called Frida's Return about Frida Khalo and I was so busy fundraising and going to meetings, it was madness - but I was able to handle it.\n\n\"My milk supply was also really good.\n\n\"I had been suffering from bad asthma and cold sores but a couple of weeks went by and I felt more energised, my skin was much better and I was healed after the birth within a week.\n\n(Image: Rebecca Grant)\n\n\"My cold sores disappeared and my asthma improved.\n\n\"Two weeks after I gave birth I had to produce a trailer for our play. I had to dance and act and get into my costume in a hangar in Norfolk.\"\n\nRebecca admits her second pregnancy with baby Rose was much harder than with her first child, Flint.\n\nShe said: \"The second time around the pregnancy was much harder. The last two months I was so tired and heavy.\"\n\nRebecca had friends round on the day Rose make her big entrance and had spent the day cooking up a feast before going into labour in the middle of the night.\n\n(Image: Rebecca Grant)\n\nShe said: \"I can't help but feed people so I cooked a huge chilli and was on my feet all day. It was a really busy day but it was such a lovely catch up.\n\n\"At about midnight I started having contractions and when they were regular I decided to wake my husband to tell him I'd gone into labour.\n\n\"He went back to sleep for a few hours and I called my doola, Rachel Graveling, who was amazing.\"\n\nThe mum of two has nothing but praise for the staff at North Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.\n\nRebecca said: \"They were absolute angels at the North Norfolk and Norwich Hospital. They were literally holding my hands and congratulating me for being in labour, they were so welcoming.\n\n(Image: Van Brooks)\n\n\"Within five minutes Rose was out. She was an 8lb 12oz baby and my husband was so happy and filled with joy.\"\n\nAnd Rebecca credits her placenta capsules with her rapid recovery after giving birth.\n\nShe said: \"If it wasn't for my placenta and all that healing and goodness and building blocks to health, I don't think I would have had an much energy and felt as energised as I do.\n\n\"I've even got back to the gym.\"\n\nNikki made up the placenta capsule, which are taken daily for between six to eight weeks.\n\nShe was inspired to set up her business in March last year because of the benefits she felt from enscapulating her own placenta.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nNikki said: \"I wanted to offer this incredible service to other mummies in the hope that they too would feel these amazing benefits throughout their postnatal recovery stage and beyond\n\n\"I have had two babies and could compare the difference significantly with my recovery.\n\n\"I never got the baby blues, which most mummies experience after having their baby due to their hormones lost after birth.\n\n\"My milk came in within an hour of drinking my first smoothie and carried on in abundance even throughout the growth spurts.\"\n\nThe businesswoman says she was full of energy following the birth of her second child, despite already being mum to a 14 month old and was up and about just two days after her caesarean.\n\nBut Nikki says the main benefit, for her, was not getting post natal depression, which she had suffered from after her first pregnancy.\n\nShe puts this down to replacing ther hormpnes she lost while giving birth with her placenta capsules.\n\nNikki said: \"All of my clients have all mentioned that they never went through the baby blues, which\u2019s shows their hormones are being regulated thats at a much quicker rate than our bodies can produce which normally they can take six to eight weeks.\"\n\nAs well as capsules, Nikki also produces oil, which can be used to help with stretch marks , and a balm.\n\nFor more information about Cherished Placentas, click here .", "description": "Rebecca Grant, who has also appeared in Emmerdale, ate her placenta after giving birth to her second baby, Rose", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Bbc", "Rebecca Grant", "Van Brooks"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20687809.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rebecca-Grant.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
