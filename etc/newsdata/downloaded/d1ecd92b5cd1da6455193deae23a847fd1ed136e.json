The big question is how they frame what happens after that.\n\nHints could be offered in the Fed's new policy statement, to be released at 2 p.m. Eastern time, and at Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. Here's what to watch:\n\nHow Much Insurance\n\nFed officials have described their two rate cuts earlier this year and a potential third reduction this week as akin to purchasing an insurance policy -- in this case, against the risk of an economic downturn brought on by sagging business investment, slowing global growth and heightened trade uncertainty.\n\nThey face two pressing questions: With one more cut, do they think they have bought enough insurance? And are they willing to say how they feel on that question publicly?\n\nLast month, some officials wanted to send a stronger signal about when rate cuts might end.\n\nOn the other hand, signs that economic weakness has broadened since the Fed began cutting rates in July could make officials uneasy about providing too much guidance about their plans. Also, markets aren't now putting a high probability on a December rate cut, with investors in futures markets pricing in a roughly 20% chance of a cut at the Fed's next meeting.\n\nFed officials will release their statement hours after the Commerce Department is scheduled to provide its initial estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product. And new figures on hiring and manufacturing activity are to be released Friday morning.\n\nThe Statement\n\nTweaking the language in the Fed's postmeeting statement could provide a strong signal about officials' outlook or their intentions because it is the product of heavy debate. It is designed to reflect the consensus view of the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the interest rates.\n\nIn the postmeeting statement in June, July and September, the Fed said the committee would \"act as appropriate\" to sustain the economic expansion. If officials cut rates as expected on Wednesday, that phrase will have been used in statements preceding every meeting in which the Fed cut rates. The Fed could change this language to signal any change in what would prompt more rate cuts.\n\nThe Press Conference\n\nMr. Powell's opening statement at his press conference and his answers to reporters' questions provide an opportunity for additional nuance. In the past, they also have led to unpleasant reactions from investors -- including in May and July this year, when he signaled that the committee envisioned less aggressive rate reductions than did the markets.\n\nMr. Powell has repeatedly characterized the Fed's current rate cuts in the context of so-called insurance cuts of 1995-96 and 1998. In both those episodes, the Fed cut rates just three times and avoided recession.\n\nIf the Fed cuts rates Wednesday, Mr. Powell is likely to face questions over whether the chapter on insurance cuts has ended. Central-bank officials could shift next to a stance in which the economy stabilizes and they hold rates steady, or to a new one in which increasing weakness prompts them to cut rates further to combat an unfolding downturn. Mr. Powell will likely be pressed on what conditions would warrant additional cuts.\n\nFunding Markets\n\nThe Fed's rate-setting committee met by videoconference on Oct. 4, the first such unscheduled meeting in six years, to discuss funding-market strains that developed on the eve of the committee's meeting last month. On Oct. 11, they agreed on and announced a plan to buy short-term Treasury debt at an initial pace of $60 billion a month and to continue those purchases into the second quarter of 2020.\n\nSeparately, the Treasury Department will issue its quarterly refunding statement on Wednesday morning, outlining its borrowing plans for the next three months.\n\nFed officials could further refine their recent measures on the balance sheet at this week's meeting. Officials haven't said precisely what level of bank deposits, known as reserves, they are targeting with these current purchases, or whether they would extend the scope of Treasury debt purchases beyond bills, which have maturities of one year or less.\n\nMr. Powell could also face questions about discussions to relieve funding strains either with a standing lending facility or changes to bank regulation.\n\nDissents\n\nAt least one Fed president has dissented at each of the past three meetings. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George dissented against the last two rate cuts because they would have preferred to leave rates unchanged, and they appear likely to do so if the Fed cuts rates Wednesday. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard has dissented at two of the past three meetings because he would have preferred bigger rate reductions.\n\nNevertheless, little evidence suggests that dissents have complicated Mr. Powell's ability to build strong support for any particular policy choice so far this year.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 05:44 ET (09:44 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
