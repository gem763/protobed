He turned those coal deposits into energy which fuelled the manufacturing boom across the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are the sunburnt country, land of droughts and flooding rains and here in Queensland we've got both those acts of God. What we need to do is capitalise on those moments of excessive downpours and ensure they're stored away for the difficult months and years of drought.\"\n\n$20m funding boost\n\nOn Friday, Mr Morrison delivered $20 million in funding to help rural and regional communities stage local agricultural shows. The money will go to help upgrade showground infrastructure.\n\nMr Frydenberg dismissed criticism of the government's assistance package from Labor. He is yet to read the final report of drought coordinator-general Stephen Day but called on the opposition to back locals.\n\n\"You would think they'd have learned those lessons from their defeat and just get on with supporting the government's drought plan which is being rolled out, and focus on supporting the communities.\"\n\nLabor's agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon welcomed MPs visiting drought-affected areas to better understand the impact on farmers and their communities.\n\nBut he said the government's approach remained \"ad hoc and ineffective\".\n\n\"It's very hard to believe that after six years this government is finally determined to do something comprehensive and meaningful on drought.\n\n\"The time for touring is over, the time for action is now.\"", "description": "Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has flagged new measures to support drought-hit communities, saying the scale of the dry has to be seen to be believed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5459%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_901%2C$y_436/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8a28da06f28cf535a85438e98bd0c590da273842", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
