[YONHAP]\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in promised a government drive to promote artificial intelligence (AI) technology on Monday, adding that a \u201cnational AI strategy\u201d will be rolled out this year.An expanded budget of 1.7 trillion won ($1.45 billion) and regulatory reforms were part of Moon\u2019s promises.Moon made a surprise appearance at Naver\u2019s Deview 2019 conference held Monday in Gangnam District, southern Seoul. An annual event where Naver\u2019s executives share their tech achievements, Deview is one of Korea\u2019s largest conferences for AI experts and developers.\u201cArtificial intelligence is not simply an achievement in science and tech - it\u2019s a new civilization (\u2026) a partner of mankind,\u201d Moon said during a keynote speech.\u201c[Korea] is not an AI pioneer, nor is our technology globally top class (\u2026) but we have experience leading an internet revolution amid a currency crisis, competence in manufacturing, ICT infrastructure and abundant data of an e-government,\u201d he added.Moon pledged to create a business environment favorable for developers and AI start-ups.On regulations, he promised a shift to a \u201cnegative\u201d regulatory framework that allows start-ups to engage in businesses that are not specifically prohibited by law.Korean startups have long complained about the country\u2019s \u201cpositive\u201d regulatory framework - in which companies can only do what\u2019s specifically permitted by law, thus blocking businesses in legal \u201cgray zones.\u201dThe government will also push for AI-related departments in local universities - a response to complaints that Korea lacks AI experts - and lower the bar to allow professors to take up positions at private companies.As for financial support, government budgets will be pumped into backing start-ups, public investment in cutting-edge technology like AI chips and providing cloud computing infrastructure to local companies, schools and labs. According to Moon, the administration\u2019s budget for 2020 expanded funding for AI, data and 5G networks by 50 percent on year to 1.7 trillion won.\u201cIn an era of artificial intelligence, data and cloud computing are a must,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government will seek fundamental changes in constructing a database, opening access and using it.\u201d The president also pledged to push for reforms of data laws to expand access to the private sector within this year.Another goal Moon proposed was the transformation into an \u201cAI government,\u201d meaning AI technology will be incorporated in the government\u2019s systems. Public administration services will be shifted to the internet.Artificial intelligence was the field that SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son stressed to Moon during a meeting last July.Son advised that Korea\u2019s \u201cfirst, second and third\u201d focus should be AI technology, for which massive investments will lead to larger revenues and job creation.Moon has been ramping up visits lately to business operations of Korea\u2019s major companies. This month alone, the president made appearances at Samsung Display\u2019s Asan factory in South Chungcheong and Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s Namyang Technological Research Center in Gyeonggi.BY SONG KYOUNG-SON [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/28201831.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
