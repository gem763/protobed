It is a U.K. problem, caused by a referendum that ultimately failed its voters because it did not explain what the implications of voting Leave would be \u2014 for the British people, but also for Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement, which underpins 21 years of fragile peace on the island.\n\nThe replacement of May with Boris Johnson as prime minister does not change the facts of the matter. Johnson's strategy of labeling the backstop as anti-democratic and demanding it be ripped out of the Withdrawal Agreement, without suggesting any viable replacement for it, is ridiculous. His statement that the U.K. will simply not put up any border infrastructure also fails to recognize the U.K.'s very real responsibilities to the WTO and any future partner.\n\nThroughout this entire process, the EU has worked with its British counterparts to try to find a way forward. The fact that the British government is now backsliding on commitments previously made is disappointing \u2014 and entirely of its own doing.\n\nThe Brexit ball is squarely in Britain's court. Only the British can pull itself out of this mess and avert a disruptive no-deal Brexit.\n\nBecause, yes, the economic consequences of no deal would be bleak. But the potential impact of a messy Brexit on the fragile peace in Ireland is far more dangerous. Responsibilities must be met.\n\nNeale Richmond\n\nIrish senator and spokesperson for Fine Gael; chair of Brexit committee in Irish Senate\n\nDublin, Ireland", "description": "Responsibility for averting no-deal mess lies in London.", "authors": ["Neale Richmond"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167103853-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
