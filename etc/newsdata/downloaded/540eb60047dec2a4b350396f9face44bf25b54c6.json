Wait For Earnings Before Acting", "language": "en", "text": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) is scheduled to today before market open. The lender is forecast to report EPS of $4.86 on $8.34 billion revenue, dramatically lower than the $6.28 EPS and $8.65 billion revenue results of the corresponding quarter last year.\n\nThe reversed outlook for \u2014 a bank's bread-and-butter \u2014 since last year explains why analysts cut expectations. Plus, the lender is likely to get hit by disappointing IPOs such as WeWork and an overall slowdown in M&A activity.\n\nStill, whatever the earnings results for Goldman are, technicals are indicating that investors appear not to have written off the stock. Instead, they're waiting on the fence at a crucial price level which could determine whether the medium-term trend will resume higher or the short-term downtrend will extend into the medium-term.\n\nGS Daily Chart\n\nThe price fell below its uptrend line since the December bottom on Oct. 1 and closed right on top of it for the first time Monday. This marks the initial point of defense for the uptrend line. The second is the Aug. 15 low, which was respected by the Oct. 3 low that bounced right off it on an intraday level. That $193 level is crucial, especially after the Sept. 13 high failed to ascend above the July, $222 highs.\n\nBack to the uptrend line since the December selloff \u2013 the fact that prices rebounded from the Oct. 3 lows to close right on top of it is an obvious representation of its \u201cline in the sand\u201d status, as traders wait for earnings results.\n\nHowever, the weight of the evidence does not provide a clear signal.\n\nOn the one hand, there was Friday\u2019s extremely bearish shooting star \u2014 the intrinsic pessimism of which increases with its confirmation of the resistance beneath the broken medium-term downtrend line. Note, also, Monday\u2019s decreased volume, reinforcing Friday\u2019s volatility as something traders dread.\n\nOn the other hand, multiple price, momentum or volume-based indicators such as MACD, RSI, ROC and OBV are showing a rebound, suggesting a continued rally.\n\nUltimately, we'll have to see whether the shooting star\u2019s high is broken out or the August-October lows are breached. And traders now seem to be waiting for earnings to provide the clues for direction.\n\nTrading Strategies\n\nConservative traders would wait for a new high to extend the medium-term uptrend above the July peak to go long or for two independently (not counting the medium term\u2019s uptrend line peak of July) descending peaks and troughs to short.\n\nModerate traders may go long with a close above the shooting star or enter a short with a new low below $193.\n\nAggressive traders may range-trade between Friday\u2019s highs and the October lows, before or after earnings are reported, depending on risk aversion.\n\nTrade Sample \u2013 Short Position Setup\n\nEntry: $206\n\nStop-Loss: $208\n\nRisk: $2\n\nTarget: $200\n\nReward: $6\n\nRisk:Reward Ratio: 1:3", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
