Milan failed to hold their nerve\n\nAfter last Saturday's derby disappointment, which led to Giampaolo answering some uncomfortable questions about job security, it was important for Milan to get back on track as soon as possible.\n\nThey handled the first half well \u2013 aside from some disappointing finishing \u2013 and then fell apart after the break, their form in front of goal costing them again in the final stages.\n\nDefeat leaves Milan 13th with six points.\n\nBelotti rewarded for his persistence\n\nIt is fair to say Torino fans might have expected more from Belotti in the first half, particularly after that bad miss when Donnarumma went AWOL. However, he more than made up for his mishaps in the second period, netting twice to win the game and take the hosts up to sixth.\n\nDonnarumma fortunate\n\nDespite letting two goals in at the weekend, Donnarumma was impressive in the derby. The same could not be said this time around. He was unconvincing for both Torino goals, while a moment of madness at the end of the first half should have been punished.\n\nKey Opta stats\n\n- This was the first time since 1942 that Torino have come from behind to beat Milan in Serie A.\n\n- Belotti has scored in six of his last seven home games in Serie A, netting nine goals in that period.\n\n- Milan have conceded two goals in back-to-back Serie A matches for the first time since March 2018.\n\n- Milan midfielder Giacomo Bonaventura made his first league appearance for 340 days when he came off the bench midway through the second half, as he returned from a serious knee injury.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nMilan return to San Siro on Sunday for the visit of a Fiorentina side who have underwhelmed in the early stages of the season, while Torino are at Parma 24 hours later.", "description": "Andrea Belotti scored twice as Torino came from behind to beat AC Milan 2-1, increasing the pressure on visiting coach Marco Giampaolo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Uy43sC_DoDUU1ULp4w2krA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QBmmbZ2QJHPQRi.rD1G3jg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/b6f23d5c225a9c1c70b845bbf94c1b55", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
