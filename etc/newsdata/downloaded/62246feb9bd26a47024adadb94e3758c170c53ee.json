A spokesman for the airport said it had cancelled 110 flights on Monday and a further 45 on Tuesday.\n\n\"Never, never, never have separatists acted violently, never,\" added Junqueras, in emailed answers to questions passed on to Reuters by his staff late on Monday.\n\n\"What I'm sure of is that this conflict is to be resolved via ballot boxes ... we are convinced that sooner or later a referendum is inevitable because otherwise, how can we give a voice to the citizens?\".\n\nCatalan regional leader Quim Torra said on Tuesday his government would continue to defend the right to self determination, and that another referendum was \"(the) most positive solution for trying to solve this.\"\n\nTwo years after the debacle of the first plebiscite, Catalonia's independence drive still dominates much of Spain's fractured political debate.\n\nThe country's main national parties are divided on whether to grant the region additional autonomy on top of the administrative and budgetary controls it already holds - but all except the far-left Podemos oppose holding a referendum on independence.\n\nBesides, sharp divisions within Catalonia itself over the issue of independence have contributed to taking the steam out of the independence movement in recent months, with protests drawing smaller crowds.\n\nAsked what message he had for the independence movement after the sentencing, Junqueras said: \"That prison and exile have made us stronger and makes us ever more convinced, if that is possible, in our profoundly democratic beliefs.\"\n\nHe and the others planned to appeal the sentences at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, he said.
