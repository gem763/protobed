Still, to me, it would be a huge shame if the next generation of otaku (Japan nerds/geeks) missed out on the countless great anime, manga, and video games from previous decades.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like an old geezer, I feel it\u2019s part of my duty to pass on essential manga reading to the next generation.\n\nWhile there are many, many more than five must-read titles from the 1990s, I am focusing on more obscure manga. Therefore, I won\u2019t be mentioning titles like \"Dragon Ball\" or \"Sailor Moon\" since they are popular series nearly all self-respecting otaku know.\n\nAll the manga on this list are available in both English and Japanese and we\u2019ve listed where to find them, too.\n\n1. 20th Century Boys (1999)\n\nOne of the most interesting manga I\u2019ve read in a long time, \"20th Century Boys\" is a love letter to late Showa Era (1960 \u2013 1989) Japan. From the 1969 moon landing and Y2K to analog radios to the American rock music influence and more, this manga is filled with memorable historical points and culture of 20th century Japan.\n\nFrom award-winning writer and illustrator Naoki Urasawa comes a story of action, coming-of-age, dystopia, sci-fi and even a little romance thrown in. It\u2019s mind-blowing how many genres Urasawa manages to skillfully combine into a single manga masterpiece.\n\nWhere the manga truly shines is in the mystery at the center of the story: a sinister cult trying to spread a deadly virus all over the world and its unknown leader who goes only by \u201cFriend.\u201d\n\nBest described as a mix of \"Stand By Me,\" \"War of the Worlds\" and \"The Hunger Games,\" \"20th Century Boys\" follows Kenji Endo, a young convenience store owner who realizes that the cult\u2019s logo is the same symbol he and his friends created together in their childhood.\n\nGenre(s) : dystopia, mystery, sci-fi, steampunk, thriller\n\n: dystopia, mystery, sci-fi, steampunk, thriller Available on: Vol. 1 of \"20th Century Boys\" is available on Amazon\n\nClick here to read more.\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://gaijinpot.com/\n\n\u00a9 GaijinPot", "description": "With hundreds of new manga titles released each year, some titles capture the hearts of readers, break into the mainstream and sell millions of copies, while others crash and burn almost instantly into fleeting oblivion.
