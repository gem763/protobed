Slowly all the discussions will come to an end,\" Mueller told reporters in Athens when asked about his future at Bayern.\n\nHe has spent his entire career at Bayern, who he joined as a schoolboy in 2000, and club president Uli Hoeness has made it clear that no one at the club wants to see Mueller leave.\n\nIt has so far been a difficult year for Mueller, who was told by Germany coach Joachim Loew in March, alongside fellow 2014 World Cup winners Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng, that he has no future in the national squad.", "description": "Inter Milan and Manchester United are interested in signing former Germany star Thomas Mueller, who has lost his starting place at Bayern Munich.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2733/3e583783fc774dbda1d77b73558f8eaa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
