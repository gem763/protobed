Here is a look at the various complications.\n\nShifting the responsibility\n\nMigrants arriving at the US southern border are largely coming from Central American countries, including violence-stricken Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nMost travel overland, passing through other countries en route. The US wants migrants to claim asylum in one of them. It is making these changes because its own migration services are overwhelmed.\n\nHowever, other countries would also struggle to cope, and Mexico and Guatemala will be the most affected by this new plan as they are closer to the US.\n\nAmnesty International says the Mexican asylum system is \"underfunded, absolutely beyond its capacity and inadequate in identifying even valued asylum claims\".\n\nThere is also a backlog of people who have already made the journey and are now stuck at the US southern border.\n\nThe US had already imposed the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program - also known as \"Remain in Mexico\" - which forces asylum seekers to wait for their US court hearings on Mexican soil.\n\nWho decides on 'safe' countries?\n\nMigrants would only be expected to apply in another country if it is deemed \"safe\".\n\nHowever, Central American migrants are also often deliberately sought out by gangs in neighbouring countries, because they are vulnerable. Many have reported finding the journey north as dangerous as their lives at home.\n\nThe US cannot declare a country to be a safe without the formal agreement of the place in question.\n\nThe US and Canada have such a reciprocal agreement. When asylum seekers arrive in the US from somewhere else, via Canada, they will be sent back to Canadian immigration authorities. The same applies in reverse.\n\nSo far, Mexico has rejected the US plan.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What happens if Mexico doesn't stem the migrant flow?\n\nThe outgoing Guatemalan president, Jimmy Morales, had been willing to discuss it with President Donald Trump, but the country's Constitutional Court temporarily blocked it on Monday.\n\nAny third-country agreement would not apply when a country's own nationals seek to flee. Guatemalans and Mexicans are also fleeing their homelands - albeit not on such a large scale as some Central American countries.\n\nThe increased dangers\n\nThe US says there are exemptions to its new rule, including for migrants denied protection in a country and victims of human trafficking.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Taking difficult routes has cost people their lives\n\nHowever, humanitarian organisations are concerned that people could start taking more dangerous routes to bypass official borders - perhaps even travelling by sea.\n\nThe legal problems\n\nThe new rule has not passed through US Congress, and was, instead, announced by the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIt is expected to be challenged in the country's federal court.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union said: \"The Trump administration is trying to unilaterally reverse our country's legal and moral commitment to protect those fleeing danger. This new rule is patently unlawful and we will sue swiftly.\"\n\nUnder the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, there is no obligation on refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. Asylum seekers are protected against prosecution for illegal entry to a foreign country by Article 31 of the Convention.\n\nIn a statement, the UN Refugee Agency said the US measures would \"endanger vulnerable people in need of international protection from violence or persecution.\"\n\nStep into the shoes of a migrant\n\nMaria is fictional.
