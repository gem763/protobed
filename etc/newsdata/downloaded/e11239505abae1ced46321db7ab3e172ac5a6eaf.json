We will fight for righteousness. I put on the mask to tell the government that I\u2019m not afraid of tyranny.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in the crisis, men on the roof of one of the Chinese military\u2019s barracks in Hong Kong raised a yellow banner warning protesters they could be arrested for targeting its barracks walls with laser pointers.\n\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army has remained in barracks since the protests started, leaving Hong Kong\u2019s police force to deal with the massive protests.\n\nCritics fear Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam\u2018s use of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance that gives her broad powers to implement any measures she deems necessary could pave the way for more draconian moves.\n\nThe law was enacted by British colonial rulers in 1922 to quell a seamen\u2019s strike and was last used in 1967 to crush riots.\n\nThe shooting of a 14-year-old boy Friday night, the second protest victim of police gunfire, stoked fears of more bloody confrontations.\n\nAn 18-year-old protester was shot at close range by a riot officer on Tuesday. He was charged with rioting and assaulting police, while the younger teen was arrested.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Lam invokes emergency powers to ban face masks\n\n14-year-old boy \u2018shot by police officer in Hong Kong\u2019\n\nTrump \u2018told China he would keep quiet on Hong Kong protests\u2019\n\nWho are the foreigners demonstrating in Hong Kong?", "description": "Protesters in Hong Kong have devised a new face-covering hairstyle to evade the new ban on masks.A tutorial video showing viewers how to plait their hair to achieve the anonymising hairstyle was shared on Twitter by journalist Cherie Chan.", "authors": ["Samuel Osborne"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ez386upgLFPuPhR3Td.j9g--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/f987a0192f4f6dd7de9f6271111fec20", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
