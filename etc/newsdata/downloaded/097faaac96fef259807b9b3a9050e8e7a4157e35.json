If Democrats were so inclined, they have enough potential witnesses to draw these proceedings out through the end of Trump\u2019s term in office, which, while perhaps defeating the purpose of impeachment, could expose a much wider conspiracy in the U.S. government.\n\nHere is a rough, and likely incomplete, list of potential witnesses:\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani\n\nThe president\u2019s personal lawyer was by his own admission \u2014 or boast \u2014 Trump\u2019s point man in pressuring Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. While Giuliani has refused to say if he holds a security clearance, he has claimed that the State Department asked him to \u201cgo on a mission\u201d to pursue a Ukrainian investigation of Biden.\n\nAttorney General William Barr\n\nIn the summary of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, the U.S. president mentions Barr five different times. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,\u201d Trump said, according to the summary of his call. \u201cI will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call,\u201d Trump says in another passage. The whistleblower also mentions Barr in his complaint, saying \u201cAttorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.\u201d\n\nBarr\u2019s Justice Department advised the director of national security not to share the whistleblower complaint with Congress.\n\nInspector General of the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson\n\nAfter reading the whistleblower complaint against Trump, Atkinson deemed it \u201curgent\u201d and sought to send it directly to congressional intelligence committees. Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, intervened, sending it instead to the Department of Justice. Atkinson will testify before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee on Oct. 4.\n\nPresident Trump, left, with U.S. Attorney General William Barr, Sept. 9, 2019. (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP) More\n\nAssistant Attorney General Steven Engel\n\nEngle wrote the opinion of the Justice Department that the whistleblower complaint \u201cdoes not involve an \u2018urgent concern,\u2019\u201d referring it instead to the criminal division of the Department of Justice rather than turning it over to Congress.\n\nFBI officials who received a referral regarding the whistleblower complaint\n\nOn at least three occasions, the Justice Department contacted the FBI about the whistleblower complaint. Ultimately, however, the FBI deferred to the DOJ\u2019s opinion that the call between Trump and Zelensky did not involve criminality.\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats\n\nCoats stepped down from his position on Aug. 15, nearly three weeks after the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky. Yet Coats said this week that although the call was immediately flagged by White House staffers as problematic and the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was filed on Aug. 12, he never saw it.", "description": "The list of people Democrats may seek information from regarding President Trump's attempt to obtain dirt on Joe Biden seems to grow by the minute.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bSxGL3L56No107NAgwPlVg--~B/aD0zMjkyO3c9NDkzODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/912d4be0-e157-11e9-ac0d-0da17085edea", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
