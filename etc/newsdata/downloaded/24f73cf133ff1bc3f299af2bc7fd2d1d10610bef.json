The astonishing fact is that there is none,' writes Levin.\n\n'Furthermore, laboratory studies have shown that some terrestrial microorganisms could survive and grow on Mars.'\n\nGilbert Levin (pictured above) is a former NASA scientists who believes that the agency has already uncovered the first signs of life during a mission to Mars in the 1970s\n\nLevin points to a pair of missions in 1976 when NASA sent its Viking Landers 1 and 2 to Mars - the agency's first-ever trip to the Red Planet.\n\nWhile there, the landers took several samples from the Martian soil in an attempt to search contents for signs of biological life.\n\nOne of the tests called the Labeled Release life detection experiment, which was spearheaded by Levin, involved combining martian soil samples with organic compounds and then looking for signs of carbon dioxide.\n\nAny microorganisms that were present in the soil would have metabolized the compound and released CO2, says Levin.\n\nShockingly, the tests initially turned up a significant four positive results and we duplicated by both landers located 4,000 miles apart on the planet.\n\nDespite the initial success, however, further experimentation from NASA turned up empty-handed when NASA searched for specific microorganisms.\n\nAccording to the agency, the tests 'provided no clear evidence for the presence of living microorganisms in soil near the landing sites.'\n\nNonetheless, Levin says evidence of alien life has been bolstered by other discoveries since the Viking missions like evidence of water and other oganice compounds and the failure of 43 subsequent studies on the finding to provide a direct explanation.\n\nPictures from NASA's first Mars landing (above) were among the benefits reaped from the Viking missions\n\n'In summary, we have: positive results from a widely-used microbiological test; supportive responses from strong and varied controls; duplication of the LR results at each of the two Viking sites; replication of the experiment at the two sites; and the failure over 43 years of any experiment or theory to provide a definitive nonbiological explanation of the Viking LR results,' writes Levin.\n\nLevin says even though evidence has pointed toward signs of life, subsequent missions to Mars since the Vikings touched down have failed to pursue the unexplained threads.\n\n'NASA has already announced that its 2020 Mars lander will not contain a life-detection test,' he writes.\n\n'In keeping with well-established scientific protocol, I believe an effort should be made to put life detection experiments on the next Mars mission possible.'\n\nIn future missions, Levin suggests including equipment capable of discerning microorganisms more precisely - the likes of which has advanced greatly since the 70s - and to reexamine evidence found by his own mission.\n\n'[A new] study would likely produce important guidance for NASA\u2019s pursuit of its holy grail,' he writes.", "description": "In an op-ed published in Scientific American titled 'I'm Convinced We Found Evidence of Life on Mars in the 1970s' former NASA scientist\u00a0Gilbert Levin writes that\u00a0 a mission to Mars turned up alien life.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/20/19603992-0-image-a-11_1570821538664.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
