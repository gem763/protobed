It touched the 351 mark in the AQI index, according to Central Pollution Control Board data.\n\nDon't Miss 125 SHARES 137 SHARES 118 SHARES 1.1 K SHARES\n\nThe deterioration in air quality has been linked to stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana. Stubble burning has also contributed to an increase in PM2.5 levels - atmospheric particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres - with the concentration of the pollutant expected to rise to 6 per cent by October 15.\n\n\"The fire counts in Punjab and Haryana have increased significantly over the last two days. The wind direction in Delhi is westerly which is unfavourable thereby carrying the smoke from the stubble burning towards Delhi,\" LS Kurinji, a research analyst with the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), was quoted by news agency IANS.\n\nThe prevailing wind direction and stubble burning are likely to cause further dip in the air quality.\n\nDelhi air quality has been declared \"poor\" for the first time in three months. It had remained \"satisfactory\" between July and September, aided by the monsoon and favourable wind conditions.\n\nThe National Green Tribunal, in 2015, banned crop residue burning in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab.\n\nBCCL/Representational Image\n\nHowever, the ban existed only on papers as farmers continue to defy the ban amid a lack of financial incentives.\n\nFarmers in Haryana and Punjab are still engaged in the practice with at least 120 cases of stubble burning reported from the state so far.\n\nA layer of haze lingers over the national capital as the stubble burning season begins and the air quality will only worsen with Diwali around the corner.\n\nOn Saturday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said smoke from crop residue burning in neighbouring states has started reaching Delhi and the air quality has started deteriorating.\n\n\"It has been widely reported that the smoke coming to Delhi is due to the burning of stubble in Karnal, Haryana,\" he had said.", "description": "Delhi's air quality remained poor for the third day on Saturday and is likely to deteriorate further, even as experts said the situation is better than corresponding periods in the last few years. The centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recorded the overall air quality index (AQI) at 221, which falls in the poor category.", "authors": ["Shweta Sengar"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/delhi_air_quality_stubble_burning_1570955554_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
