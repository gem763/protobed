In the first image, Baldwin adjusts Bieber\u2019s bowtie as the two share a kiss. In the second, the 22-year-old model sticks out her tongue for a sillier snap. Both images also feature the words \u201cThe Biebers\u201d with their second wedding date \u2014 Sept. 30, 2019 \u2014 in the top left-hand corner.\n\n\u201cMy bride is [fire],\u201d Bieber captioned the slide show.\n\nThe wedding came a little more than one year after the duo tied the knot in a New York City courthouse in 2018, though Baldwin later denied the deed.\n\nAccording to an interview with Vogue in March, Bieber said the two \u2014 who have known each other for nearly a decade and dated for a short while before embarking on two weddings \u2015 decided to marry the first time because they wished to remain celibate and \u201ca desire finally to have sex was one reason they sped to the courthouse.\u201d\n\nPeople reports that about 150 guests attended the nuptials. Guests included models Kendall Jenner, Camila Morrone, Jourdon Dunn and Joan Smalls, as well as Bieber\u2019s manager, Scooter Braun. Bieber\u2019s ex, Caitlin Beadles, was also in attendance.\n\nCongrats (again) to these two crazy kids!", "description": "The couple tied the knot for the second time in a ceremony in Bluffton, South Carolina.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d936ac12100002d00f90c89.jpeg?cache=lofiadoehf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
