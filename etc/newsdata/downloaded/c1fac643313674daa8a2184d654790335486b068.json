I ordered an unlocked refurbished iPhone 6s through Walmart Online and chose Chubbies Tech because reviews for some other vendors for the 6s were hot and cold and the price was unbeatable. I know - you get what you pay for, right? Well, this phone came way before the expected arrival date and was in excellent condition. Doesn't appear to even have been used! As advertised it basically updated to ios 10.3.3 all by itself and is working marvelously. I ordered a BYOP for Walmart Family Mobile and it came in less than 2 days. I can't offer a better recommendation or advice for purchasing refurbished phones (this is my 5th) except to read and heed consumer reviews and to compare and weigh the good and bad for each vendor. I have been lucky in all my purchases here and hope you do as well.\n\nMost helpful negative review Average rating: 1 out of 5 stars, based on reviews NON-refurbished\n\nThis was suppose to be refurbished. If they had even turned it on to check it they would have seen the screen half blacked out and jumping!!!", "description": "Free Shipping.
