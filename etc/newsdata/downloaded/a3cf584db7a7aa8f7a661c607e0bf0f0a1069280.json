Gray decided that he deemed such an action a betrayal and, as a result, he hosted a party in The Queen Vic in retaliation to announce his wife\u2019s pregnancy \u2014 in spite of her requesting him to keep it a secret for the time being.\n\nHowever, unbeknown to Gray, Chantelle had been having stomach pains and, upon going to hospital, she was informed that she\u2019d had a miscarriage. Devastated, Chantelle pleaded with Ash (Gurlaine Kaur Garcha) to keep the loss of the baby a secret.\n\nShe later attempted to open up to Gray, but he proceeded to tell her how delighted he was with life, and thus she was unable to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the weight of what\u2019s happened becomes too much for Chantelle and, in the coming episodes, she breaks down and informs Karen about her miscarriage.\n\nNaturally, Karen supports her daughter.\n\nThe big question is: will Gray find out the truth?\n\nHe\u2019s never missed an opportunity to remind Chantelle of how much he\u2019s looking forward to being a dad again and, with Chantelle happy that Gray\u2019s finally getting help for his violent behaviour, it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s afraid to tell him.\n\nWill Karen perhaps spill the beans to Gray?\n\nOr will Chantelle warn her mum to keep shtum?\n\nEastEnders airs these scenes Thursday 24thOctober on BBC One at 7:30pm.\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Christmas return for Janine Butcher as she destroys the Slaters?\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Panesar family connected to someone already living in Walford\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Chantelle opens up to her mum about her devastating loss.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chantelle-and-Karen-2-c82b_1571837404.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
