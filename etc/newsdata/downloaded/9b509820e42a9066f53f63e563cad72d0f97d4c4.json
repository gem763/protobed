I was on vacation with my kids, but being away from Moscow, where everyone I know was protesting outside the courthouse, made me feel even more helpless than I did when I was there with them a few days earlier. So I asked if I could help with the reading.\n\nThe next day three members of Pussy Riot would be convicted of felony hooliganism and sentenced to two years in penal colonies\u2014for a protest they staged inside Moscow\u2019s Cathedral of Christ the Savior on Feb. 21. The cathedral had been virtually empty during the morning hours, and the protest lasted all of 40 seconds before the women were removed by security. But church staff members testified during the trial that they were deeply traumatized by observing the young women in brightly colored dresses and balaclavas lip-sync to a recording of what Pussy Riot calls its punk prayer: \u201cMother of God, cast Putin out.\u201d\n\nI listened to one of New York\u2019s performance artists read a Pussy Riot manifesto sent from jail. \u201cPatriarch Kirill [head of the Russian Orthodox Church] has repeatedly evangelized on behalf of the figure of Putin\u2014clearly no saint\u2014and continues to urge his parishioners not to participate in protest rallies...We respond to the political activity of the faithful, and counter the patriarch\u2019s efforts to distort the truth on behalf of all believers. And we needed to sing it at the altar, not on the street in front of the temple\u2014that is, in a place where women are strictly forbidden. The fact is, the church is promoting a very conservative worldview that does not fit into such values as freedom of choice, the formation of political identity, gender identity, or sexual identity, critical thinking, multiculturalism, or attention to contemporary culture. It seems to us that the Orthodox Church currently lacks all of these virtues.\u201d", "description": "The Pussy Riot trial showed how far Russia is traveling backward.
