Everyone is looking for solutions to violent crime but this isn\u2019t one of them. I\u2019m not going to harass my citizens for owning guns.\u201d\n\nMr. Louderback also represents over 3,000 sheriffs as part of the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association\u2019s immigration and government affairs committees.\n\nAnother representative of a national law enforcement group asked to remain anonymous while noting: \u201cI find it really telling now that someone who attacked law enforcement, even calling them Jim Crow, for his convenience is perfectly fine with sending them off into harm\u2019s way to collect AR-15s.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just asinine,\u201d the Free Beacon\u2019s source added.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign captured national headlines last month during a Houston debate in which he empathically supported gun confiscation across the U.S.\n\n\u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he said when asked about his legislative endgame. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Democrat also started selling \u201cHELL YES WE\u2019RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR AR-15\u201d apparel on his campaign website for $30 in multiple styles for men and women.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
