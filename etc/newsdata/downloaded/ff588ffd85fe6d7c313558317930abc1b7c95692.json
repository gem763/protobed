But here\u2019s another reason to lock down how much we share: We may be helping criminals steal their identity in the future.\n\nBarclays, an investment bank headquartered in London, has estimated that \u201csharenting\u201d will account for two-thirds of identity fraud facing young people by 2030. Part of the problem, the BBC reports, is that parents may not realise how much data they\u2019re producing for fraudsters through seemingly innocent posts on social media.\n\nThe bank says parents can reveal names, ages and dates of births from birthday messages, home addresses, place of birth, mother\u2019s maiden name, schools, the names of pets, sports teams they support and photographs. Barclays warns that such details, which will still be available when young people are adults, could be used for fraudulent loans or credit card transactions or online shopping scams.\n\nIn a video from the New York Times, three young people sat down with their mothers to talk about the over-sharing of their pictures and private information online. Eighteen-year-old Elmer Gomez, in particular, was concerned with information his mum had posted on Facebook, including his full name and address. When his mum defended the sharing of his photos and information \u2014 saying it\u2019s private and only seen by her friends and family \u2014 he responds, \u201cAll it takes is one person and one hack, and there goes all your privacy.\u201d\n\nIn addition to identity theft concerns, the Times points out that \u201cparents also risk unwittingly exposing their children to data broker profiling, hacking, facial recognition tracking, pedophilia and other threats to privacy and security.\u201d\n\nHow To Create A Fake Identity And Stay Anonymous Online You don't need to have evil motives for wanting to fake your identity or go incognito online; for many people, it's a matter of privacy and avoiding spammers and scammers. Thankfully, there are a great many tools for staying anonymous online. Here are a few of the best. Read more\n\nDoes that mean you should stop sharing everything about your kids on social media? That\u2019s probably not realistic for most parents. However, Forbes reports that Stacey Steinberg of the University of Florida\u2019s Levin College of Law has said that parents should be talking with their kids early and often about what they\u2019re posting online:\n\nSteinberg is not trying to convince parents to maintain complete radio silence about their families. Instead, she is suggesting that parents give more thought to what they post, eliminate unnecessary layers of information like geotagging, and talk to their kids as soon as they\u2019re able about what\u2019s being put online about them.\n\nA good rule of thumb before you post might be to pause and ask yourself: If this picture or this information got into the wrong hands, what could that mean for my child\u2019s safety and privacy? And then post\u2014or don\u2019t post\u2014accordingly.", "description": "There are lots of reasons to think twice before we post pictures and anecdotes about our kids online \u2014 they might find it embarrassing later, we\u2019re creating a digital life they have no control over and it\u2019s an invasion of privacy, for example.
