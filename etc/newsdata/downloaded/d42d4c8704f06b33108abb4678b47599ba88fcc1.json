This market is growing.\"\n\nWhile HTC's Vive headset, which ranks among the top-selling brands alongside devices from Sony and Facebook's Oculus, has shown promise in the fledgling virtual reality (VR) sector, it remains a niche device.\n\nThe company's smartphones, which were industry trailblazers when first introduced in 2008, have for years maintained a global market share of 1% or below.\n\n\"Our goal at HTC is to be at the center of 5G,\" said Maitre.\n\n\"If we need the smartphone to win the battle, we'll keep the smartphone. If we don't need the smartphone to win the battle, we'll see.\"\n\nIn January, the company began shipping the Exodus 1, a handset that comes with a number of blockchain-centric features such as a built-in cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nHTC said in a statement that Wang will retain her role as chairwoman of its board after resigning as CEO.\n\nLast year HTC laid off 1,500 employees, roughly one quarter of its workforce. Earlier, about 2,000 HTC employees moved to Google as part of a $1.1 billion acquisition deal.\n\nThe company's annual revenue in 2018 hit NT$23.7 billion, a 62% drop from a year earlier.
