This comes after the EU granted the British government's request to delay Brexit for three months beyond its scheduled Oct. 31 date.\n\n\"There is only one way to get Brexit done in the face of this unrelenting parliamentary obstructionism, this endless willful fingers crossed 'not me, guv' refusal to deliver on the mandate of the people,\" Johnson said on Tuesday, \"and that is to refresh this Parliament.\"\n\nThe prime minister later appeared to downplay his party's prospects for the December vote.\n\n\"It's going to be a tough election but we will do the best we can,\" Johnson told reporters, even though a BBC poll gives Johnson's Conservatives a 10 percentage point lead over Labour.\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who originally opposed a snap election, said that his party dropped its opposition after a \"no-deal\" Brexit \u2014 essentially leaving the EU without conditions \u2014 was taken off the table.\n\n\"We're launching the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen,\" Corbyn tweeted. \"This is a once in a generation chance to build a country for the many, not the few.\"\n\nThe last time Britain held an election in December was 1923. It will also be the country's third general election in less than five years.\n\nIt is not all clear that the December election will settle the Brexit question. Johnson and the Conservatives would need to win a majority in Parliament to implement a Brexit plan by the EU's deadline of Jan. 31, 2020. British voters could also deliver a Parliament that is still gridlocked on the issue.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought an early general election in the hope of gaining ground in Parliament in support of the question that has roiled British politics since 2016: leaving the EU.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/29/ap_19302674475457_wide-057d0ebbc1472f153d2838dbe8d1679078871ba8.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
