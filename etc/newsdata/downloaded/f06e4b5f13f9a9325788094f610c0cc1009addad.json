The move pushes the whole controversy onto the already-crowded agenda of an Oct. 17-18 EU summit in Brussels, where Brexit and Syria will also be discussed.\n\nThe deadlock at the ministerial gathering in Luxembourg resulted from a French argument, backed in part by the Netherlands, that no date should be set for opening accession deliberations with North Macedonia and Albania until the EU revamps its whole approach to enlargement. At issue is whether the two countries adhere to EU norms on the rule of law, an area where some new member nations have been accused of backsliding.\n\n\u201cWe clearly aren\u2019t in a position today to stand by what we have repeatedly promised, namely the taking up of accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania,\u201d German Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth told reporters in Luxembourg. \u201cWe are very disappointed.\u201d\n\nEU Infighting\n\nThe infighting among EU governments reflects two competing political views: German-backed arguments that offering more Balkan countries the hope of joining the world\u2019s biggest trading club strengthens European geopolitical stability and French-led calls for deeper integration of the bloc before any further expansion.\n\nBoth Albania and North Macedonia have been lobbying to open accession talks, with the latter changing its name to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, has said both countries have made enough progress in aligning their judicial standards to merit opening of negotiations.\n\nJohannes Hahn, the European commissioner in charge of enlargement policy, predicted that EU national government heads would reach an agreement on Thursday or Friday that eluded their general-affairs ministers.\n\n\u201cIt am still confident the leaders will rectify the decision -- or non-decision -- of today,\u201d Hahn, who comes from Austria, told reporters after the Luxembourg meeting. \u201cI hope our leaders are able to see the broader picture.\u201d\n\nThe French-German split is itself a symptom of EU successes and failures over the past two decades.On the one hand, the bloc orchestrated a \u201cbig-bang\u201d enlargement in 2004 by adding ex-communist nations in eastern Europe. On the other, a Greece-triggered debt crisis that almost broke apart the euro and a rise in euroskeptic political forces that helped lead to the U.K.\u2019s Brexit decision have stoked concerns about letting in more poorer nations.Three other Balkan countries have already started membership negotiations: Serbia in 2014, Montenegro in 2012 and Turkey in 2005.\n\n(Updates with comments by EU\u2019s Hahn in seventh, eighth paragraphs)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan Stearns in Luxembourg at jstearns2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Michael Winfrey, Richard Bravo\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- France blocked a European Union drive to start membership negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania, dismissing German-led warnings that political stability in the Balkans could be at stake.At a meeting of EU general affairs ministers on Tuesday, the French government shot down a plan", "authors": ["Jonathan Stearns"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
