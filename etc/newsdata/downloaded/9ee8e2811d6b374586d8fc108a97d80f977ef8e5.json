Yeah, it\u2019s been one whole year, and we still don\u2019t know who wrote it.\n\nOn Sept. 5, 2018, the Times published a scathing essay written anonymously by someone whom the paper identified only as a senior official in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The op-ed, titled \u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,\u201d detailed a White House in which high-level officials were allegedly actively working against the president\u2019s erratic, destructive agenda in order to prevent the country from spiraling downward.\n\nWhile the anonymous writer commended Trump\u2019s policies of \u201ceffective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military,\u201d the op-ed said senior Trump aides were aware that the president\u2019s decisions are rooted in anti-democratic ideas and that many of his plans must be contained by those in his administration who secretly identify with the so-called resistance.\n\nThe op-ed also alleged that Cabinet members discussed \u2015 but never followed through with \u2015 invoking a section of the 25th Amendment that provides a process for removing a president who is deemed unfit to serve.\n\n\u201cIt may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room,\u201d the op-ed said. \u201cWe fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what\u2019s right even when Donald Trump won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe op-ed quickly gained traction among the public, with people on both sides of the aisle wondering who was behind the article. The Times said it received a wave of calls from readers either thanking or denouncing the editors for publishing the article, and it increased security in the newsroom due to the backlash at the time.\n\nIn the article\u2019s immediate aftermath, Trump called it a \u201cgutless editorial\u201d and demanded that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions investigate who wrote the article because, the president said, it was a \u201cnational security\u201d threat.\n\nThen-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted the Times\u2019 phone number and encouraged people to call the newspaper to complain about the op-ed, though many used the number to praise the Times for its decision to publish the article.\n\nAfter @PressSec directed people to call the @nytimes and ask the opinion section to out the Op-Ed writer, many have called instead to voice their support for the Op-Ed and the NYT news coverage of the Trump administration. \u201cPrint the news, honey!\u201d one told @Emily_Baum \u2014 Amy Fiscus (@amyfiscus) September 6, 2018\n\nThe Times wrote at the top of the article that it was highly unusual for the newspaper to run an anonymous op-ed. Even the Times newsroom, which is separate from the opinion section, didn\u2019t know who wrote the article.\n\nPeople spent lots of time speculating who the anonymous Trump official was: Sanders? White House counselor Kellyanne Conway? Vice President Mike Pence? Since the article\u2019s publication, some officials suspected of being the writer have vehemently denied it, the Times has continued to hide the writer\u2019s identity and nobody has come forward identifying themselves as the writer.\n\nTracking who the writer is, and whether the person is still part of the internal anti-Trump resistance, is difficult when the administration has a revolving door of aides. Since the beginning of Trump\u2019s tenure, several high-ranking officials have either resigned or were pushed out of the administration: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, chief of staff John Kelly, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, presidential assistant Omarosa Manigault Newman, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, Sessions, press secretary Sean Spicer and Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci are just a handful.\n\nWhile these departed officials haven\u2019t said whether they were part of the so-called resistance within the administration, some have spoken out against Trump or have been critical of the administration\u2019s decisions since leaving.\n\nKelly, who also had served as Trump\u2019s Homeland Security secretary, reportedly called Trump an \u201cidiot\u201d in front of aides and painted himself as the man responsible for protecting the country from some of Trump\u2019s impulses, according to NBC.\n\nRex Tillerson, who served as Trump\u2019s secretary of state until he was fired over foreign policy clashes, has alleged that the president\u2019s son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, went behind his back several times to hold meetings with foreign leaders. Tillerson has also said that he had to be \u201cvery concise\u201d when speaking with Trump to keep the president\u2019s attention while they worked together.\n\nMattis, who has remained tight-lipped about criticizing the president despite their differences, said Tuesday that he will speak out \u201cwhen the time\u2019s right.\u201d Mattis appeared to disagree with Trump\u2019s military judgment in his December resignation letter.", "description": "So, who wrote that New York Times piece by an anonymous \"senior official\" of the Trump administration who claimed to be part of the resistance?", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ef93e240000fd0c731fec.jpeg?cache=gjuqzwbius&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
