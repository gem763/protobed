It sounded like marketing, image, you need to sign this, you need to sign that. And I thought 'wow, that's not the game I love'.\n\n\"It's all part of football, but it can not be the number one, two, three, four, priority. First of all please try to improve the game we play.\n\n\"And that's what I am good in. All the rest can happen but it's not so important for me.\"", "description": "The German had the chance to join the Red Devils after leaving Borussia Dortmund ahead of becoming Liverpool boss", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Image", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20567624.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Liverpool-FC-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
