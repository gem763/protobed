Even a big bank has limited resources, so they need to prioritise. The issues highlighted by the royal commission are going to be a high priority.\"\n\nMr Carrodus added that wealth management customer remediation had been hastened by the banks\u2019 plans to divest from wealth management and make the assets more attractive to prospective purchases.\n\nThe big four banks are in varying stages of offloading their wealth management subsidiaries. ANZ has already sold its financial advice dealer group businesses to IOOF and is awaiting board and regulatory approval for the completion of the $1 billion pensions and investments deal.\n\nCBA, Westpac and NAB have announced their intentions to sell the Colonial First State, BT Financial Group and MLC wealth brands respectively, but have not provided clarity on the terms of the divestments.", "description": "Analysts are bracing for further customer compensation surprises in the wake of ANZ\u2019s fresh $651 million bill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3531%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_457/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dc68d0acc063205b6e862c2602586546200378d1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
