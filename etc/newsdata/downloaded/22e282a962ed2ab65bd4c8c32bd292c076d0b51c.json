Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune via AP, Pool)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 A jury has convicted a man of first-degree murder in the shooting death of a 9-year-old Chicago boy who was lured into an alley with the promise of a juice box.\n\nProsecutors contended that Dwright Boone-Doty and fellow gang member Corey Morgan planned the November 2015 slaying of Tyshawn Lee before Boone-Doty took a gun Morgan gave him and shot the boy.\n\nThe Cook County jury found Boone-Doty guilty on Thursday night. A separate jury deciding Morgan\u2019s fate has been sequestered after not being able to reach a verdict.\n\nProsecutors have said the boy was killed because the men believed his father belonged to a rival gang. They said the men thought that gang was responsible for fatally shooting Morgan\u2019s brother and wounding his mother.\n\nProsecutors said tests revealed that Boone-Doty\u2019s DNA was on the basketball found near the boy\u2019s body and they played a tape of Boone-Doty bragging to another jail inmate that he\u2019d killed the boy.", "description": "A jury has convicted a man of first-degree murder in the shooting death of a 9-year-old Chicago boy who was lured into an alley with the promise of a juice box.
