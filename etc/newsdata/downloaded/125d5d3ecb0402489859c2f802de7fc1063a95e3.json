It's expected to lay out procedures for public hearings, led by the House Intelligence Committee. It will give committee staff the ability to question witnesses in public, among other provisions, according to Democratic officials.\n\n\"It wouldn\u2019t be practical to have three committees with over 100 members conducting an open hearing, so the open hearings will be in the Intelligence Committee,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Monday. \"The Judiciary Committee may also have its own hearings when the work of the Intelligence Committee has concluded, but the fact-finding on Ukraine will continue to be led by the Intelligence Committee, and it will be our committee that conducts the open hearings on that subject.\"\n\nThe vote on the resolution comes as Republicans and the White House have argued against Democrats' handling of the impeachment process, although it's unlikely the resolution will go far enough to satisfy Republicans' demands.\n\n\"Speaker Pelosi is finally admitting what the rest of America already knew -- that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding, refusing to give the President due process, and their secret, shady, closed door depositions are completely and irreversibly illegitimate,\" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. Grisham noted she would not be able to comment fully until she sees the full text of the resolution.\n\n(MORE: Not exactly a dungeon with hyenas: 3 things to know about the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry)\n\nThe resolution will be introduced by House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, who tweeted it will \"ensure transparency and provide a clear path forward.\"\n\nRepublicans have slammed what they say is a lack of transparency in the impeachment process, as Democrats have called nearly a dozen officials to give depositions behind closed doors. Republicans have called for transcripts of that testimony to be made public, have accused Democrats of cherry-picking information to be released or leaked, and have argued President Trump deserves to have counsel present to cross-examine witnesses.\n\n(MORE: Graham introduces resolution condemning House impeachment process)\n\nPHOTO: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) listens during a news conference discussing the College Affordability Act, Oct. 15, 2019, in Washington, DC.
