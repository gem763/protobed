We may have to get in wars, too. OK? We may have to get in wars,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe're better prepared than we've ever been,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf Iran does something, they'll be hit like they've never been hit before. I mean, we have things that we're looking at.\u201d\n\nThe remarks from the president come as his administration confronts escalating tensions across the Middle East and navigates new troop movements in the region.\n\nTrump in recent days has sought to promote a temporary cease-fire agreement Vice President Mike Pence negotiated last week with President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, aimed at halting the slaughter of U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria by Turkish forces.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s directive to evacuate the last American service members from Syria has forced congressional lawmakers and Pentagon officials to confront the threat of a potential resurgence by Islamic State militants.\n\nDespite the withdrawal from Syria and Trump\u2019s campaign trail pledge to halt U.S. involvement in \u201cendless wars,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced earlier this month the administration would be deploying another wave of troops to Saudi Arabia to help protect the kingdom from Iran\u2019s regime.\n\nThe diplomatic relationship between Washington and the Islamic Republic has increasingly frayed since Trump\u2019s decision last year to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 multinational nuclear pact, and the administration\u2019s steady series of sanctions against Tehran have in part provoked acts of Iranian aggression around the Persian Gulf.", "description": "The president specifically threatens to hit Iran \u201clike they\u2019ve never been hit before\u201d if the regime provokes the United States.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey", "Darren Samuelsohn"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177447465-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
