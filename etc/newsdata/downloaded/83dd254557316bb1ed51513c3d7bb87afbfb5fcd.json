However, when you talk about the ability to have infinitesimally-sized pieces of value so someone can pay you [...] for using your data ... [...] the promise of cryptocurrency is to actually take power away from those large companies.\u201d\n\nWhile emphasizing that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t particularly trust Facebook,\u201d he nonetheless placed the pushback against Libra by global regulators and governments in the context of a culture of fear and argued that \u201cthe best and most productive way\u201d forward is for governments to engage:\n\n\u201cWhether it's Libra, when we talk about ICOs and different things, the fact is that it's no different from when stocks and bonds were startup financial services.\u201d\n\nThis fear may pertain to data privacy and rights \u2014 a concern he expressly shares \u2014 or to the perception that a government\u2019s loss of control over currency poses economic and national security risks. Yet, he said:\n\n\u201cIt's going to happen. The Internet can't be shut off.\u201d\n\nFintech innovation a \u201cnational strategic imperative\u201d\n\nThe Premier underscored the centrality of fostering fintech for Bermuda\u2019s economy, noting that 90% of the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings come from international business, largely from financial services.\n\nGiven that fintech is the future of the industry, he said that creating an environment that is conducive to innovation \u2014 through the \u201cHoly Trinity\u201d of government, regulators and industry \u2014 is a national strategic imperative for Bermuda.\n\nHe seeks to encourage local talent to stay and invest in the country\u2019s future, helping to create jobs and new ownership opportunities, he said.\n\nAs reported this week, global financial services company Circle has just announced that Bermuda has become the first government to accept its stablecoin USD Coin for tax payments.", "description": "The Premier of Bermuda, Edward David Burt, has said that cryptocurrencies are a great equalizer and characterized fintech innovation as a national strategic imp...", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMjYzYmJkYjgwNjlmZDk0OGFhOWM5ZDU3YTliYTFhMmYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
