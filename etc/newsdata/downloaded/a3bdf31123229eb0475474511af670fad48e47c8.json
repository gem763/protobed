If even such a catastrophic seven-day stretch is only good for a 0.7 slide in approval, surely nothing can change until at least Election Day 2020.\n\nBut there\u2019s another story: Support for impeachment has gone up sharply over a few weeks, settling in the low-to-mid-50s in the past few days. This suggests that, even though the approval and disapproval ratings are barely changing, something important is happening.\n\nTrump\u2019s disapproval numbers, like his approval, have been uncannily stable for years. The people who approve of Trump are largely monolithic: They will support Trump no matter what. The disapprovers are more varied. Some of them are as fervently anti-Trump as the approvers are pro-Trump, and they have long wanted him removed from office. But some of them have disliked what Trump was doing, but still didn\u2019t favor an impeachment inquiry or removing him from office.\n\nSomething has changed for this group over the past few weeks, and 10 to 15 percent of them have decided they back impeachment after all. Their precise reason is hard to discern. Was it the Ukraine-call transcript? The whistle-blower complaint? Foreign policy? The launch of an inquiry? Or simple fatigue with the endless parade of bad news from the White House? Some of them have multiple or varying reasons.\n\nAs Philip Bump of The Washington Post noted last week, Gallup has only once found support for impeachment as high as it was last week\u2014and that was days before Richard Nixon resigned. But as Nixon\u2019s resignation approached, his approval rating sank; Trump\u2019s has remained stable, which is one reason there\u2019s been no sign of his resignation anytime soon. He still hasn\u2019t lost his base.\n\nRead: The liberation of Mitt Romney\n\nBut with impeachment looming, members of Trump\u2019s base aren\u2019t the people whose sentiments the president needs to track most closely. Should the House impeach him, it\u2019s senators who will vote on whether to remove him. Republicans have the edge in the chamber, and none of them\u2014not even Mitt Romney\u2014has signaled they\u2019d vote to remove Trump, much less enough GOP senators to get to the two-thirds required to convict.\n\nIn a set of new polls last week, Morning Consult found that five of the most vulnerable Republican senators up for reelection in 2020 have seen their approval slide over the past few months. They\u2019re all doing better than Trump in their respective states, too\u2014a sign that he is a drag on them. The reality is that few Republican senators have ever been enthusiastic about Trump. As long as it\u2019s good politically for them to stick with him, they may do so. But if it proves politically advantageous to break with him, why wouldn\u2019t they? (Question their morals, but not their math.)\n\nThis is still an extreme scenario at the moment, but it\u2019s the weakness in Trump\u2019s impeachment firewall, and it\u2019s big enough that Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace reported on Sunday that one top Republican sees the chance of Trump being removed at one in five. Maybe nothing can make Trump\u2019s base abandon him. But maybe that doesn\u2019t matter.", "description": "Trump\u2019s base isn\u2019t going anywhere, but that might not matter to his fate.", "authors": ["David A.
