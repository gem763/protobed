Here you can see the bird in the distance (centre)\n\nThe footage shows fields below with the plane turning slightly left and right to stay on course when the bird (pictured) hits the glass with a huge bang\n\nThe video shows the twin jet airliner flying straight into the poor bird that is heading away from the plane and the pilot the drops the camera in shock.\n\nLocal media including life.ru and new9.ru said the incident took place over an unspecified location but involved a Russian airline, as they noted that when the pilot dropped the phone, he curses in Russian, saying 'oh, damn!'\n\nIt is unclear whether the windscreen was damaged by the impact or whether the unspecified flight was affected.\n\nThe video shows the twin jet airliner flying straight into the poor bird that is heading away from the plane. Pictured: the cockpit window splattered with bird after the incident\n\nBird strikes can be a significant risk to planes and are more common at lower altitudes as they come into land or take off.\n\nHowever although a shock when they hit the fuselage or the window, the risk is less severe except in the unlikely instances when the window breaks, which can cause injury to the pilots inside from breaking glass and depressurisation.\n\nIndustry experts warn that the greater risk is when the birds are sucked into the engine, which can lead to loss of power at a crucial stage in flight.\n\nThe video was posted on YouTube by the channel 'WBR Avia' who said the plane was a Boeing 737.\n\nYouTube subscriber 'Gideon' said: 'Shouldn't the pilots receive notification when an object is approaching directly at the aircraft?'", "description": "Local media said the incident took place over an unspecified location but involved a Russian airline, as they note when the pilot drops the phone, he curses in Russian, saying 'oh, damn!'", "authors": ["Amelia Wynne For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/20/20295604-0-image-a-12_1572293130930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
