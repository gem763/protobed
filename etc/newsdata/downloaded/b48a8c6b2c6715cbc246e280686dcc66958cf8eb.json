I want both of them to be a success this year. We have 46 matches or 50 matches.\n\n\"We are in the first 25 per cent of the competition. I think that we have time so I can find a way that both of them shine. If this doesn't happen, it is going to be a mistake of mine.\"", "description": "Nketiah scored yet another crucial goal for Leeds as they snatched a late point at Deepdale", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Image", "Mark Cosgrove News Images Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703716.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Preston-North-End-v-Leeds-United-EFL-Sky-Bet-Championship-Football-Deepdale-Preston-UK-22-Oct.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
