From there, the research found swing voters are less likely to vote for a Democrat when they learn of their policy proposals:\n\nWhen deciding between Mr. Trump and the Democratic nominee, voters in the middle \u2014 the independents who could ultimately tilt things in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor \u2014 became six percentage points less likely to vote Democratic after reading about the leftward turn compared with the independents who had read the innocuous content. [Emphasis added]\n\nLikewise, the research found that there is no increase in mobilization to vote in the 2020 election for Democrat voters who learned of the candidates\u2019 endorsement of leftist policies.\n\n\u201cDemocrats who read about the leftward positions did not indicate they were more motivated to vote and campaign for the eventual nominee than those who hadn\u2019t read about them,\u201d Agadjanian notes.\n\nAs Breitbart News has chronicled, 2020 Democrats such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have endorsed some of the least popular policy positions in the Democrat primary.\n\nFor example, the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that a plan to give free, taxpayer-funded healthcare to all 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. is the most unpopular policy position thus far. The plan was endorsed by Biden, Warren, Sanders, and the majority of other Democrat primary candidates.\n\nSimilarly, voters by a majority remain opposed to raising taxes on working and middle-class Americans in order to end private health insurance and provide \u201cMedicare for All\u201d to all U.S. residents. The plan to end private health insurance, endorsed by Warren and Sanders, has turned off American union workers as millions would have their employer-negotiated healthcare plans terminated should such a plan take effect.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
