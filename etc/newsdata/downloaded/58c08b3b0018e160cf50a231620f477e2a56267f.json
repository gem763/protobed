It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve done anything more dramatic than join the odd protest march, and certainly the first time I\u2019ve been arrested.\n\nStrangely, I felt totally at peace the entire time. I experienced a clear sense of call from God to be there, so I felt I had nothing to fear.\n\nAs a minister, people tend to expect that you will be law-abiding, so as I return to the \u2018day job\u2019 I will have some explaining to do! It\u2019s no surprise that some disapprove of my actions, but I have also had huge support from Christians and others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Church has become so much a part of the establishment that people can easily forget that there is a great tradition of people of faith speaking truth to power, even when there is a personal cost.\n\nI am a newcomer to XR \u2013 although I\u2019ve done my background reading, I\u2019ve not managed to attend any groups or training.\n\nThis week is the first active involvement I\u2019ve had, through Christian Climate Action (CCA), one of the faith groups participating in the protests.\n\nI have been extremely impressed by the XR ethos \u2013 emphatically non-violent, listening, non-hierarchical, relationship-building \u2013 and it\u2019s amazing to see how successfully this culture has been built in a rapidly expanding and diverse movement.\n\nTo me, all this seems to be consonant with what the church ought to be, but often struggles with.\n\nI, like many others, have tried writing letters, signing petitions and speaking to my MP, but not enough is being done\n\nAt heart, my reason for participating is because I believe we are in an emergency situation.\n\nThe train is hurtling towards a climate crisis and we need to pull the red alarm handle. XR is trying to raise the alarm, but the driver doesn\u2019t seem to be listening.\n\nI, like many others, have tried writing letters, signing petitions and speaking to my MP, but not enough is being done. People criticise XR\u2019s tactics and say that disrupting people\u2019s lives isn\u2019t the right way to go about it, but history shows us that non-violent direct action does bring change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat red handle on the train says \u2018penalty for improper use\u2019. If we pulled the handle because someone spilled their coffee, we would rightly be in trouble because it\u2019s something we can manage on our own. This is more than a mere coffee spill.\n\nFor years now the message seems to have been that we all just need to adjust our habits a little bit; turn the heating down a degree, recycle rubbish, swap the car for public transport a little more often. These things are all good and necessary, but they simply cannot address an emergency of this scale.\n\nIt is far beyond being dealt with by individual consumer choices, regardless of how many of us are on message.\n\nI recognise that the police have a job to do, but there have been questions about the lawfulness of some of the actions taken, such as confiscating disability equipment, and now the latest development in banning all protests in London. The right to peaceful protest is protected under the European Convention of Human Rights.\n\nI\u2019m also sorry for those who have been inconvenienced by XR\u2019s actions, but this emergency is bigger than our personal needs.\n\nThe effects of the climate crisis have already brought huge disruption, including in Cumbria, where I live and work. Bridges and roads aren\u2019t blocked by protesters, but have instead been washed away, leaving some communities with 40-mile detours for months on end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese events are becoming more frequent.\n\nIt will get worse, and those who are poorest will suffer the most, particularly in developing countries. I cannot stand by while injustice grows.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the penalty for pulling the red handle will be for me, but I believe I took a measured and proportionate action in the face of an emergency.\n\nWe need the driver to stop the train.\n\nThe Revd Jo Rand is a Methodist Minister serving in Cumbria.\n\nMORE: Leader of XR arrested as Trafalgar Square camp is cleared by police\n\nMORE: Extinction Rebellion needed to close London\u2019s roads to make our point\n\nMORE: You can\u2019t call yourself a climate change activist if you\u2019re doing coke", "description": "Reverend Jo Rand, who works for the Methodist Church, was arrested and spent 20 hours in a prison cell.
