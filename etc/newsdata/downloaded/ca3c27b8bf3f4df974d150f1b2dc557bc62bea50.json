-\n\nMore than a quarter of Lebanon's population lives in poverty, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe country endured a devastating civil war that ended in 1990 and many of the political leaders are those that fought, often brutally, along religious lines.\n\nThe government is set up to balance power between multiple sects, which include different Christian groups, Sunni and Shiite Muslims, as well as the Druze.\n\nBut in reality it often entrenches power and influence along sectarian lines.\n\nHariri presented a vast economic reform plan Monday, including 50 percent salary cuts for ministers, but it did little to assuage the demonstrators.\n\n\"Too little, too late?\" the French-language newspaper L'Orient Le Jour wondered in a front page editorial Wednesday.\n\nLebanese media discussed a range of options for further measures including a government reshuffle and early elections.\n\nThe protests, which Lebanese politicians have accepted were spontaneous, do not have a specific leader or organiser.\n\nLebanon's economy has been sliding closer to the abyss in recent months, with public debt soaring past 150 percent of GDP and ratings agencies grading Lebanese sovereign bonds as \"junk.\"\n\nFears of a default have compounded the worries of Lebanese citizens exasperated by the poor quality of public services, with residents often suffering daily electricity shortages and unclean water.", "description": "A week of unprecedented Lebanese street protests against the political class showed few signs of abating Wednesday, with thousands again gathering across the country, braving rain and a heavy military deployment.
