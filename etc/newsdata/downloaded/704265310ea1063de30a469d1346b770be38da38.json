Nick Boles MP for Grantham 61% Leave (right)\n\nAnd he represented the Remain-backing financier again in September when she challenged Boris Johnson\u2019s bid to suspend Parliament in the Supreme Court, a clash that saw the PM humiliated.\n\nIt was claimed by senior Tories that Mr Letwin had left a meeting with the Prime Minister seeking a compromise over his amendment and immediately rang the top lawyer from No 10 on Friday evening.\n\nLord Pannick denied the suggestion he had been in contact with Sir Oliver from Downing Street or at all on Friday, but confirmed he had aided the rebel with his drafting of the amendment from a legal perspective. He defended his right to do so as he is not involved in any current Brexit legislation.\n\nLast night a senior Tory said: \u2018This isn\u2019t Letwin\u2019s amendment, it\u2019s Pannick\u2019s amendment. Pannick is the organ grinder \u2013 Letwin\u2019s just the useful idiot.\u2019\n\nAntoinette Sandbach MP for Eddisbury 52.2% Leave (left). Oliver Letwin MP for Dorset West 51% Leave (right)\n\nAnd furious Cabinet Ministers broke cover to publicly slam Sir Oliver, with Trade Secretary Liz Truss tweeting: \u2018Extremely frustrating meaningful vote has been prevented. The country wants us to support this deal and move on to the future. We will not give up!\u2019 Tory MP Owen Paterson added: \u2018Passing the Letwin Amendment and declining even to come to a verdict on the new Brexit deal just about sums up this rotten Parliament.\u2019\n\nRebel Labour MP Caroline Flint blasted Remainers who had underestimated Mr Johnson\u2019s odds of getting a Brussels deal, hitting out: \u2018This was a panic measure to reinsert the three-month delay for one reason only to thwart a deal.\u2019 Yesterday\u2019s results indicate Mr Johnson may actually have the numbers to pass his Brexit deal in a straight up-and-down vote, with 306 voting with the Government including all 283 currently serving Conservative MPs and 11 of the 21 Tories expelled by Mr Johnson last month.\n\nThe six Labour MPs who voted with the government and are also expected to vote for the Prime Minister's deal\n\nAnd some of the nine Tory rebels who voted with Mr Letwin, including David Gauke and Nick Boles, have indicated they would support the deal after the extension had been requested.\n\nTory whips had embarked on a frantic attempt to win back the support of the sacked Tory rebels and were delighted half of them voted with the Government. A source said: \u2018It\u2019s becoming increasingly clear which ones are the irreconcilables and which ones have a future in the Conservative Party if they back this deal.\u2019\n\nA Downing Street insider also compared the whipping of Saturday\u2019s vote to \u2018snakes and ladders\u2019.\n\n\u2018Obviously voting for the deal is a very big ladder, but it\u2019s not a simple path back.\u2019 They claimed voting for Letwin or any other delay to Brexit was obviously \u2018a very big snake\u2019 all the way\u2019 back to square one\u2019.", "description": "Ten former Tory rebels derailed the crucial Commons vote, dubbed 'Super Saturday', helped by Lord Pannick QC - who has led the charge against the PM in the Supreme Court.", "authors": ["Harry Cole Deputy Political Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19936950-0-image-a-49_1571519392126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
