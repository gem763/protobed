If you want to make a deal, you have to submit this advert in the Giornale di Sicilia [Sicily\u2019s daily newspaper].\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Caravaggio\u2019s Nativity with St Francis and St Lawrence.

Benedetto told the superintendent of cultural affairs of Palermo, who then had the advert published in the newspaper. Two weeks later, the priest received a second letter \u2013 this one with an added mafiosi threat.\n\n\u201cThe letter was accompanied by piece of the painting, a tiny piece of the canvas, which was intended to make clear to me that they really had the Caravaggio in their possession,\u201d Benedetto told his interviewer. \u201cI went straight to the superintendent and informed him of what was happening. I left him the letter and the piece of canvas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mafia was doing with the painting what they normally do with kidnapping victims\u201d, says D\u2019Anolfi, who, at 45, is now an acclaimed director and will be screening the full interview next month in Palermo. \u201cThey had sent a piece of the painting just like they normally send a finger or an ear of a kidnapping victim.\u201d\n\nThe letter requested a second advert in the Giornale di Sicilia, but this time the superintendent refused and instead reported Benedetto to the police on suspicion of having organised the theft himself. Benedetto was for a short period placed under investigation.\n\n\u201cThey even fingerprinted me. Later the superintendent apologised,\u201d he told D\u2019Anolfi. \u201c[He] admitted that he had made a mistake. But at that point, the damage had been done.\u201d\n\nThe fate of the Nativity has been the subject of speculation for nearly half a century, ever since two criminals used razors to cut it from its frame in the Palermo church where it had hung for more than 350 years.\n\nAmong theories that have captured the imagination of art history enthusiasts is that the painting may have been eaten by rats after being left to rot in a barn.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gaetano Badalamenti. Photograph: Bettmann Archive\n\nBenedetto\u2019s claim of the mafia\u2019s involvement was borne out 17 years after he spoke to D\u2019Anolfi when Italian investigators revealed in May 2018 that a turncoat, Gaetano Grado, had told them the painting had been held by Badalamenti and that a member of the boss\u2019s crime family he had been put in touch with an art dealer in Switzerland \u2013 where the Caravaggio could now be.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until after Benedetto was no longer under investigation that he had corroboration of mafia involvement when a priest in Carini, 12 miles from Palermo, called him in early 1970 to say he had seen a photograph of the stolen masterpiece.\n\n\u201cHe said that he had had a painting restored, which had been stolen shortly afterward,\u201d Benedetto claimed. \u201cHe told me that he was convinced it was the local mafia, and that he had contacted some mafiosi in order to get it back. Then he said a young man had come to see him with two photos: one, a photo of his painting; the other, the Nativity. He then pointed to his missing painting \u2013 a work by a Tuscan artist of lesser renown \u2013 and they returned it.\u201d\n\nSicilians dare to believe: the mafia\u2019s cruel reign is over Read more\n\nBadalamenti was the boss of nearby Cinisi and at the time one of the most powerful mafia figures in Sicily, running a $1.65bn (\u00a31.33bn) heroin trafficking network to the US. He was arrested in 1984 under the leadership of the then US attorney in New York, Rudy Giuliani, and died in a Massachusetts hospital in 2004.\n\nBenedetto went back to the police with his new information but told his interviewer nothing had happened. \u201c[The police] had known for years the location of the painting. It was in the province of Palermo. The Mafiosi would use it to flaunt their power,\u201d he said.\n\nA mafia informer, Salvatore Cancemi, had separately told prosecutors in the late 1990s that the Nativity had been put on display for meetings among the most powerful bosses in Sicily as a symbol of their prestige. The current investigation suggests that the painting could have been transferred to Switzerland after the death of Badalamenti.\n\nThe head of Italy\u2019s anti-mafia commission, Rosy Bindi, stated last year: \u201cWe hope to find it and bring it back to its home in Palermo.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A recreation of the Caravaggio hangs in the Oratory of San Lorenzo. Photograph: Reda & Co/UIG via Getty Images\n\nD\u2019Anolfi said Benedetto\u2019s interview provided important new information on one of the most notorious art thefts of the 20th century. \u201cTwenty years earlier, and just two years before his death, he revealed what the authorities would only disclose last year,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the interview he tells D\u2019Anolfi of the mafia boss\u2019s feared crime family: \u201cThe Badalamentis have the painting. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d\n\nBenedetto, who after the theft always refused to speak to journalists, disclosed more on the circumstances surrounding it. He said a few months before the theft, he received a visit from a journalist from Italian state broadcaster Rai, who wanted to interview him about the Caravaggio for a programme called The Forgotten Masterpieces. He declined the offer. \u201cI told the journalist that if the public learned such a painting existed, then its theft was assured because there were no security measures in place for that painting.\u201d\n\nRai did however obtain permission from the same Palermo superintendent who later reported Benedetto to the police, to broadcast images of the Caravaggio. The priest\u2019s warning became prophecy \u2013 mere months later, the Nativity was stolen.\n\nThe 2001 interview lay locked in a drawer until last year, when the the Sicilian association Amici dei Musei, which is promoting the restoration of the Oratory of San Lorenzo, learned that Benedetto had given an interview and got in touch with D\u2019Anolfi. It asked him to organise an exclusive screening in Palermo on the 50th anniversary of the theft.\n\nThe director said that at the time of the interview he thought the police had already investigated Benedetto\u2019s claims. \u201cThe priest said he had informed the police about all this. To be honest, I thought that the information contained in that interview was already in the possession of the authorities.\n\n\u201cHowever, in hindsight, Benedetto\u2019s revelations look more credible now that the recent investigation has confirmed his version of the facts. Sometimes I think that if this interview came out before, maybe people would have thought he was just a crazy priest.\u201d\n\nThe unedited interview will be shown at Palermo\u2019s Teatro Biondo on 15 October, during a week of cultural activities supported by the association Le Vie dei Tesori featuring other stolen artworks still missing.", "description": "How masterpiece was kept in the home of a powerful mafia boss, who sliced off a piece in order to make a deal with the church", "authors": ["Lorenzo Tondo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00a2c4033d685c64a7762d7e41e9ef491a700dfe/223_3_1475_885/master/1475.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc436862ac806804d9efc05bf6781fa5", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
