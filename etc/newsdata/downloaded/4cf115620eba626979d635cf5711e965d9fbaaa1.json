I look forward to learning more details in the coming days.\u201d\n\nBusiness groups also expressed relief that tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods would not rise to 25 percent next week. But they noted substantial duties remain in place and more could still be on the way in December.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said no decision has been made yet on whether to suspend another wave of tariffs scheduled to take effect on Dec. 15. Trump is threatening a 15 percent tariff on a wide range of consumer goods like laptops, smartphones and footwear.\n\n\u201cThere is plenty of time to make that decision, and that is certainly part of this process that the Chinese are working their way through,\u201d Lighthizer said in the Oval Office.\n\nThe U.S. trade chief also said the two sides were very close to an agreement on a \u201cworkable dispute-settlement mechanism\u201d to enforce the pact.\n\nChina agreed to increase limits it has placed on foreign ownership in its financial services sector, ratchet up certain intellectual property protections and boost purchases from U.S. farmers who have suffered from Beijing\u2019s tariff retaliation.\n\nTrump said there will be $40 billion to $50 billion in new agricultural purchases. Lighthizer said China would address regulations on animal and plant health regulations and genetically modified crops, which U.S. farmers say have made it hard to sell products in the country.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a deal of this magnitude for the American farmer,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump also said there was agreement on intellectual property practices, without providing details explaining China's commitments.\n\nThe outcome on intellectual property will likely tackle \u201c20th century\u201d issues like protection of copyrights and trademarks rather than 21st century data and cyber issues, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Myron Brilliant told reporters this week.\n\nThe two countries also rolled out a previously agreed-upon deal that reaffirms international commitments to refrain from devaluing currencies to gain an export advantage.\n\nLighthizer said an easing of export restrictions on blacklisted Chinese telecommunications company Huawei is not part of any deal.\n\nChina has yet to make deeper changes to policies that the U.S. side says provide unfair subsidies to Chinese domestic firms, improperly control data flows and force U.S. companies into joint ventures that require them to hand over technology in order to do business in the lucrative Chinese market.\n\nThe Chinese delegation did not bring offers related to those core U.S. demands during this week's talks, people close to the negotiations said.\n\nDespite Friday\u2019s announcement, other tensions in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship continue unabated.\n\nJust this week, the Trump administration put export sanctions on 28 Chinese government agencies and technology companies because of alleged involvement in human rights abuses of Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in China\u2019s Xinjiang region. Beijing viewed that action as unwelcome U.S. interference in Chinese domestic affairs.\n\nThe National Basketball Association also faced China\u2019s fury this week after Houston Rockets\u2019 general manager Daryl Morey expressed support on Twitter for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters.\n\nThat, in turn, is fueling congressional interest in taking on China. As many as three bills dealing with Hong Kong are tentatively scheduled for votes in the House next week.\n\nTrump said he discussed Hong Kong with the Chinese delegation, maintaining that the unrest there has \u201ctoned down,\u201d and arguing that the deal was a \u201cpositive thing\u201d for the Chinese territory.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. manufacturers, retailers and other businesses across a range of sectors still face 25 percent duties on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and 15 percent duties on more than another $100 billion in Chinese exports.\n\nBeijing also has its own retaliatory tariffs on around $110 billion worth of American goods, which has resulted in a 16 percent drop in U.S. exports to China this year.\n\nThe U.S. goods trade deficit with China, which hit a record $419 billion in 2018, is on track to fall more than 10 percent this year as a result of tariffs imposed by both sides, giving Trump a victory of sorts. But that has been more than offset by an increase in the trade deficit with the rest of the world, as U.S. companies have shifted their supply chains to other countries.\n\nAsked whether the first-phase deal could still fall apart in the weeks before it\u2019s signed, Trump replied: \u201cWell, anything can happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will,\u201d he added. \u201cI think the likelihood of it falling apart is not so good.\u201d", "description": "Deal covers about $250 billion in Chinese goods.", "authors": ["Adam Behsudi", "Doug Palmer", "Megan Cassella"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-872013572-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
