It's really hard.'\n\nSolicitor Adam Wilson, of Midlands law firm FBC Manby Bowdler who are taking Wickes to court on Miss Jones' behalf, said the DIY giants had a clear duty of care to Samantha on the day of the accident.\n\nHe added: 'We say that the accident was entirely preventable and that Wickes has failed in its duty of care by allowing Samantha and Michael to enter an area which was clearly not safe.\n\n'There was debris flying around the outside area and it should have been obvious to the store management that customers were being endangered by being allowed to go outside.'\n\nSamantha, who is also being supported by the Police Federation, is seeking compensation for her injuries and also for loss of income.\n\nWickes have been approached for a comment.", "description": "Samantha Jones, 37, was making what she thought was a routine trip to a Wickes store in Coventry when she was hit on the head by a wooden shelving unit blown over by stormy weather.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/09/20209952-0-image-a-2_1572079748043.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
