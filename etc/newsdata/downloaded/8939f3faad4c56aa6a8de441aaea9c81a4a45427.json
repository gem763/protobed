However, Kim's family and friends thought the new level of security was a bit excessive. Kourtney Kardashian complained to Kim that she almost had to sign an NDA to enter Kim's property to pick up North West, while Kris complained that the security made her show identification to prove she was Kim's mother. The matriarch was not pleased about how difficult it was to visit her daughter, so she decided to do something about it.\n\nWhile hanging out with Jonathan Cheban, Kim received a phone call from Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, who urged Kim to get home because her \"whole security just tackled\u201d Kris. Kim was horrified as she watched the whole thing go down on the surveillance footage on her phone. \"Why on Earth would someone tackle my mother?\" Kim asked. As she reached her house, Kim saw an ambulance truck outside and stated, \"I'm gonna kill this guy.\"\n\nKim ran into her backyard and, upon seeing Kris on a stretcher, screamed. As Kris laid on the stretcher with a neck brace on, Kim was in tears. The dramatic scene went on until, eventually, Khlo\u00e9 couldn't handle it anymore and broke. \"Tell them,\" Khlo\u00e9 screamed at Kris, who broke out into laughter.\n\nKris had hired a stunt double to play herself, and fake security to tackle the stunt double. She made sure that all the security cameras captured the moment, and enlisted Khlo\u00e9 to assist in carrying out the prank.\n\n\"I love a good prank, but I don't like a dirty prank. Like, I don't like something that's too below the belt,\" Khlo\u00e9 told her mother.\n\nKim did not find the prank entertaining, but Twitter did.\n\nCan't believe @KrisJenner had a stunt double tackled by security the whole time and the family fell for this prank! This will definitely go down in #KUWTK history as one of the best pranks of all-time! \u2014 Colin Brinkley (@cb_yellowjacket) September 23, 2019\n\nThat was good.

Khlo\u00e9 took to Twitter Sunday tweeting:\n\nUgh i am so so so disappointed in myself for listening to @KrisJenner for real im disgusted with myself #KUWTK \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) September 23, 2019\n\nLater in the show, Khlo\u00e9 concluded, \"We do need to make a pact that we don't do dark pranks anymore. This one was too much for my soul.\"\n\n\"The purpose of the prank was to say we love that you have this security, but we would just love to have some clearance so we can come in and out of your house,\" Kris told Kim, who shared, \"I cannot believe that my mom and Khlo\u00e9 pulled off a prank like this. She didn't have to go to this length to get the point across, but I hear you loud and clear.\" Kim also stated she's definitely going to get her revenge.
