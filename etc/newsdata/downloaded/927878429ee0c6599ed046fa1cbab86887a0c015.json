The metric the DOJ used to make this point was how many cellphones it was unable to break into to obtain this and other evidence.\n\nThat changed last week when Attorney General William Barr and his counterparts in Australia and the U.K. started emphasizing a different metric and a different topic. In a letter to Facebook and a subsequent conference, Barr emphasized that the key reason for tech firms to weaken encryption was to stymie child exploitation operations run through messaging apps.\n\nThe main encryption controversy \u2014 whether tech firms should design encryption to let users control who can see their data, or allow law enforcement to access data without user permission \u2014 hasn't changed.\n\nCryptographers and security experts still believe that weakening security to give authorities access to data will make it easier for everyone else, including bad actors, to access that data, too.\n\nBut, but, but: The focus on messaging apps and child exploitation adds a new wrinkle.\n\nJohns Hopkins associate professor Matthew Green notes that it's harder to safely weaken encryption on chat apps than on physical phones.\n\n\"If China wants to decrypt everyone in the Senate\u2019s phones,\" he told Codebook, \"they need to physically obtain all the phones.\" But chat messages can be obtained remotely \u2014 they pass through the internet to reach their target.\n\nA recent report from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace noted a variety of other reasons that the debate should focus on phones rather than messaging apps, including chat apps that continuously change encryption keys, a valuable tool that is tough to maintain while extending access to law enforcement.\n\n\"[I[f good-faith debate on all sides can\u2019t lead to more constructive discussions in this area, then there are likely none elsewhere,\" the report concluded.\n\nAnd child exploitation is a more sprawling problem to address, in technical terms.", "description": "DOJ is now emphasizing that the key reason for tech firms to weaken encryption is to stymie child exploitation operations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/vF7Ju-ErGyzPvbOQvkpOhJBSyXA=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/10/1570723815175.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
