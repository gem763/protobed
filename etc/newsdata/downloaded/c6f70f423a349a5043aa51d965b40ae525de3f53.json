The measures were in response to the Mugabe government's crackdown on political opponents as well as election-related violence. Entities owned by targeted individuals were also sanctioned.\n\nThose measures remain in place despite Mugabe's resignation in 2017 and Mnangagwa's election the following year. Officials in Washington cited Zimbabwe's failure to change laws curbing protests and media freedom. EU sanctions include targeted asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nDuring a long-winded speech, Mnangagwa blamed the sanctions for Zimbabwe's economic crisis, which is characterised by high inflation and an acute shortage of foreign currency.\n\n\"The continued judgement setting of Utopian standards for Zimbabwe are callous, vindictive and should not be allowed to continue. We say enough is enough,\" he told a cheering crowd at the stadium.\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwa attends a rally against Western sanctions in Harare [Philimon Bulawayo/ Reuters]\n\nHis supporters agreed.\n\n\"We are tired of this life,\" said Takudzwa Chipare, a Harare resident. \"We are trying to work very hard but things are tough. I think if they remove the sanctions, life can improve.\"\n\nEphraim Chizola, a member of a vendors trade group, said: \"Sanctions affect us. Banks can't mobilise lines of credit. The US sponsor the opposition so that people turn on their government.\"\n\nUS and EU officials deny such claims. In an op-ed on Thursday in the News Day publication, Washington's ambassador to Zimbabwe, Brian Nichols, said corruption, misgovernance and lack of reforms were the real causes of the people's suffering.\n\n\"What is holding Zimbabwe back? It's not sanctions. There are only 141 Zimbabwean people and companies on the United States sanctions' list. That's right, just 141, in a country of 16 million. They are on the list for good reason,\" he wrote.\n\n\"These are people who have engaged in corruption, committed human rights abuses, and undermined Zimbabwe's democratic process. Blaming sanctions is a convenient scapegoat to distract the public from the real reasons behind Zimbabwe's economic challenges - corruption, economic mismanagement, and failure to respect human rights and uphold the rule of law.\"\n\nGovernment supporters chant slogans as they march against Western sanctions at a rally in Harare [Philimon Bulawayo/ Reuters]\n\nHe alleged that Mnangagwa's government has failed to hold corrupt officials accountable and it has overseen a range of rights violations, including the killing of 17 people and the arrest of more than 1,000 others during mass protests earlier this year.\n\nThe EU mission for Zimbabwe stressed on Friday that its sanctions apply to specific individuals and not the whole country.\n\n\"Our restrictive measures comprise of a travel ban and asset freeze against [the] former presidential couple, a ban for European companies to do business with Zimbabwe Defence Industries, and an arms embargo. That's all,\" it said on Twitter.\n\n#DidYouKnow? The EU has not imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe. Our restrictive measures comprise of a travel ban and asset freeze against former Presidential couple, a ban for European companies to do business with Zimbabwe Defence Industries, and an arms embargo.

The rest is mere propaganda.\"\n\nZimbabweans are suffering because of failed leadership, corruption, bad governance and rigged elections.Only true REFORMS and a return to DEMOCRACY will fix Zimbabwe\u2019s woes.The rest is mere propaganda and a hopeless waste of time, effort and money. #stoplying \u2014 nelson chamisa (@nelsonchamisa) October 25, 2019\n\nOthers derided what they called a poor attendance at the event.\n\nDavid Coltart, an opposition senator, posted a video of row-upon-row of empty chairs at the national stadium on Twitter, saying the turnout was \"pitiful\".", "description": "People march in Harare calling on US, EU to lift sanctions on President Emmerson Mnangagwa and other top officials.", "authors": ["Chris Muronzi"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/25/7bc99a2af3b047c6a3224da9de1c8926_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
