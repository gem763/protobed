As we previously discussed, the NAVY has put new protocols in place for military pilots to record encounters with anomalous craft in our airspace and are supposedly tracking and investigating all such instances. But why don\u2019t we know more about it than the three videos they\u2019ve released so far and the eyewitness testimony of a half dozen or so pilots?\n\nThat\u2019s what Congressman Mark Walker (R \u2013 North Carolina) wants to know. And as the ranking member of the House Intelligence and Counterrorism subcommittee, he\u2019s in a position to find out. He\u2019s asking the Navy for answers and claims that they\u2019re dragging their feet in supplying his committee with answers. (Politico)\n\nNavy Undersecretary Thomas Modly responded in a brief letter on July 31 that \u201cthe Department of the Navy takes these reports very seriously and continues to log sightings and fully investigate the accounts,\u201d according to a copy provided to POLITICO. But Walker said he is discouraged by the Navy\u2019s seeming unwillingness to provide his committee with more data about the so-called unidentified aerial phenomena \u2014 the term the Pentagon prefers over the more traditional \u201cunidentified flying objects,\u201d or UFOs. He has expressed concern publicly that the craft could pose a threat to U.S. forces or territory. \u201cWhile I am encouraged the Under Secretary of the Navy confirmed that UAP encounters are fully investigated, there is frustration with the lack of answers to specific questions about the threat that superior aircraft flying in United States airspace may pose,\u201d Walker told POLITICO in a statement.\n\nWalker isn\u2019t going the full little gray alien route\u2026 at least not yet. (Never go the full little gray alien route.) He\u2019s asking if the Navy is aware of any activity by the Russians, the Chinese, or anyone else native to this planet that might explain the seemingly impossible flight characteristics of these objects being reported. Even more intriguing is his demand to know whether or not the Navy is aware of any \u201cphysical evidence\u201d to substantiate the claims.\n\nWe\u2019ve been hearing rumors of supposed physical evidence in the form of exotic materials that could be proven to have originated beyond our planet, but they\u2019ve all been coming from sources like Robert Bigelow or the To The Stars Academy (TTSA). To my knowledge, nobody from the United States government has fessed up to having any such materials. (Not that such a lack of admission proves anything, of course.)\n\nAs far as the Navy goes, their spokesperson said that they are \u201cready\u201d to accommodate any requests from the committee, but they haven\u2019t received any new requests for updates on this issue. Does Walker have his wires crossed or did the request get lost in the shuffle? Or, as he seems to suggest, are they defying a congressional request? He\u2019s asking for some pretty sensitive material if we\u2019re looking at this as a case of potential threats our military isn\u2019t prepared to deal with. But at the same time, shouldn\u2019t the public know if that\u2019s the case, providing the disclosure doesn\u2019t reveal any of our own national security secrets?\n\nIf you want some spicy reading material on a related subject, a retired, decorated intelligence officer for the 21st Air Force, Military Airlift Command, just released a book where he claims that an extraterrestrial alien was shot and killed on an Air Force base in New Jersey in 1978. Supposedly multiple people saw the body and some spooks from Wright-Patterson showed up and took it back to their base.
