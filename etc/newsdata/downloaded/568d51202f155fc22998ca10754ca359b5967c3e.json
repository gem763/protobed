Yet, losses may be limited as the currency\u2019s haven appeal should eventually prevail amid the deepening global economic gloom.\n\nThe franc has pared its year-to-date advance to about 3% on expectations the Swiss National Bank may need to ease monetary policy amid slowing inflation and a manufacturing slump. It had run into resistance even before the recent poor data when it traded at levels stronger than 1.09 per euro, which are historically associated with increased currency intervention by the SNB.\n\nScheduled events over the coming week offer limited scope to unsettle ongoing currency trends and while trade and Brexit headlines may stir up some volatility, market reactions are unlikely to extend beyond the knee-jerk.\n\nThe franc\u2019s weakening potential looks limited even on any SNB move to add stimulus, as the institution would only be joining peers such as the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve in leaning more dovish.\n\nWhile Swiss policy makers are scheduled to meet next on Dec. 12, officials would actually break a longstanding habit if they acted then. The SNB\u2019s trademark style has been to deliver surprises between meetings -- such as when it scrapped the franc\u2019s 1.20 per euro cap in 2015.\n\nTechnically, the euro has scope to strengthen due to a bullish crossover of short-term moving averages. This developed Thursday when traders noted a very large buying clip in dollar-franc, which was seen as a one-off transaction. History suggests that such a pattern, when it occurs within a firm downtrend, results in a relief rebound without triggering a big change in market sentiment.", "description": "Swiss Franc Weakness Seen Short-Lived as Haven Allure May Return", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb2ab3e199fd8cd66bafb923769c3249b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
