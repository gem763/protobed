However, members can also leave at any time, according to the new charter.\n\nThe group elected five people to serve on the board, including Facebook's David Marcus as well as representatives from Netherlands-based electronic payments firm PayU, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, blockchain company Xapo Holdings Limited and non-profit Kiva Microfunds.\n\nThese companies were either early investors in Facebook or have other links to the social media giant. One such case is Xapo, in which Marcus is an investor.\n\nA 'correction, not a setback'\n\nThe charter was signed despite online travel company Booking Holdings, which owns Priceline, Kayak and Booking.com, confirming earlier on Monday that it was pulling out of the group.\n\nBooking was the latest in a string of global backers to shun Facebook's new cryptocurrency.\n\n\"It is a correction; it's not a setback,\" said Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association.\n\nLibra lost its last global payments backers on Friday when Mastercard Inc and Visa Inc abandoned the Geneva-based Libra Association. EBay Inc, fintech startup Stripe and payments company Mercado Pago have also pulled the plug.\n\nThe latest withdrawals followed the departure of PayPal Holdings Inc from the Libra Association earlier this month.\n\nThe project is due to be launched by June 2020. Disparte acknowledged that the digital currency's regulatory issues could push back its launch date.\n\nFrance pledged last month to block Libra from operating in Europe, while Germany passed strict rules to govern blockchain technology. The Bank of England laid out high hurdles it must meet before its launch and United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has also suggested the project could not advance before concerns were assuaged.\n\nFacebook has described Libra as a community effort, but partners have dwindled from an original group of about 100 partners as regulators step up scrutiny and implement new rules regarding the digital currency.\n\nThe exodus followed warnings from politicians and regulators globally that Libra risked upsetting global financial stability, undermining users' privacy and facilitating money laundering.\n\nIts only remaining payments partner is PayU, which according to its website does not operate in the US, Canada or large swaths of Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe association's other prominent remaining members include Vodafone Group Plc, Spotify Technology SA and ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc.", "description": "Despite prominent exits, 21 founding members have backed Facebook's new governing body for its digital currency.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/18/bc9d09549bf04ab4b8119dd8ade9dce1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
