Did he just have a cold? Who can really know?\n\nEither way, Bercow\u2019s ever more passionate affair with the sound of his own voice is Brexit\u2019s only uplifting plotline so there was real heartbreak here for regular viewers.\n\nNo love story can have taken such a brutally unexpected turn since Toadfish accidentally drove Dee off a cliff on the way back from their wedding in Neighbours. That said, she returned 13 years later as her own evil twin and managed to con him out of his life savings so there\u2019s still hope for a comeback.\n\nIn two long, pointless hours of questions not a single \u201corrdeeeeaaaarr\u201d was attempted. John Bercow is not the most self-aware man, but even he seemed to realise the futility of attempting to command the authority of a room of people of whom most entirely loathe him while sounding all the while like Darth Vader\u2019s drunken granddad.\n\nAt one point, he tried to expel the full six syllables of the now infamous words \u201cSir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown\u201d (yes the \u201cInternational Lounge One\u201d is back and raring to go after his premature expulsion on \u201claw and order\u201d day at Tory Party conference).\n\nThe mere saying of his name seemed to last for around twenty minutes. The bass tremors rattled the glass in the windows. In a building that is should have been condemned around a hundred years ago, it felt decidedly unsafe.\n\nJohnson, for his part, struck a more conciliatory tone. It appeared to be a genuine appeal to MPs from all over the commons, which is sweet when you think that if he\u2019d had his way, the whole place would still be shut down.\n\nIt was a farce, of course, all of it. What is currently happening is that Boris Johnson has come up with some new Brexit proposals that could, in theory, pass through parliament, so that when the European Union inevitably rejects them, they can duly be blamed.\n\nThe proposals, essentially, replace the one hard border in Ireland with two, ten miles apart. There\u2019ll be no \u201cinfrastructure at the border\u201d, it will instead be five miles away in both directions.\n\nThe DUP are fine with it, so is Steve Baker and the fully deranged wing of the Conservative Party. But while Johnson was speaking, both Ireland and the EU dismissed it as \u201cunworkable\u201d and \u201cunrealistic\u201d. Senior figures in the EU Parliament have said it has no chance of approval in its current form.\n\nSitting two rows behind Johnson was Theresa May. Over two hours, her right eyebrow rose and fell on at least four separate occasions, a veritable concerto of human emotion.\n\nAnna Soubry pointed out the stunningly obvious in the most succinct way. All he had done was \u201ca deal with the DUP and the ERG\u201d. Theresa May\u2019s deal might not have had those people on board, but it did have the slight advantage of actually having the EU onside.\n\nIt is not hard to find a form of Brexit that the House of Commons will approve, if you stop caring whether the EU will approve it. Not hard at all. There are dozens of options.\n\nYou know the narrative arc by now. After faux breakthrough comes disappointment, then extension, and the whole futile game returns for a new season. Sometimes, with a new protagonist.
