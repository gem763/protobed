And while Melbourne has long been the undisputed King of Australian towns in that regard for the better part of two decades, suddenly the Victorian capital has a rather unlikely competitor: Sydney.\n\nThe Economist released the 2019 edition of its annual Global Liveability Ranking survey overnight, with Melbourne maintaining the second place overall finish that it first achieved in 2018.\n\nBut the real surprise packet is the frankly inexplicable resurgence of Sydney as, apparently, one of the world\u2019s most liveable burgs. The much-maligned New South Wales capital not only managed to better its 2018 mark of fifth overall, but it climbed all the way up to number three.\n\nThird place.\n\nSydney \u2013 lockout law-addled, rail network-imploding, second airport in fucking Badgery\u2019s Creek-lookin\u2019, can\u2019t get bottle of cleanskin red after 10pm-ass SYDNEY \u2013 is now the third most liveable city in the world.\n\nRoll that one around in the old brain box for a hot moment or ten.\n\nREAD MORE Here's What Happens When A Coalition MP Hears What Life Is Like On Newstart\n\nSydney shot up the rankings with an overall index score of 98.1 out of 100, besting fancied international cities like Osaka, Vancouver, and Copenhagen in the process.\n\nThe meteoric and frankly improbable rise up the rankings is due to, according to The Economist, an overall improvement in Sydney\u2019s \u201cculture and environment score,\u201d which saw \u201can increased focus on combating and mitigating the impacts of climate change, as outlined by the city\u2019s \u2018Sustainable Sydney 2030\u2019 strategy.\u201d So it\u2019s good to know The Economist straight-up didn\u2019t bother to look at any Australian policy above the municipal level.\n\nOn the overall list, Sydney now sits just 0.3 points behind Melbourne, who scored an overall rank of 98.4 which included perfect marks in categories such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure (lol sure), and a near-perfect mark in culture and environment.\n\nAbove them, Vienna retains its most liveable city crown after the Austrian city upended Melbourne for the top spot on last year\u2019s list.\n\nCop the ten most \u2013 and least \u2013 liveable cities according to The Economist below.\n\n2019 TEN MOST LIVEABLE CITIES\n\nVienna, Austria (99.1) Melbourne, Australia (98.4) Sydney, Australia (98.1) Osaka, Japan (97.7) Calgary, Canada (97.5) Vancouver, Canada (97.3) Toronto, Canada (97.2) Tokyo, Japan (97.2) Copenhagen, Denmark (96.8) Adelaide, Australia (96.6)\n\n2019 TEN LEAST LIVEABLE CITIES", "description": "Against seemingly all odds, Sydney has just been named the third most liveable city on the planet, according to an annual survey.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/sydney.jpg"}
