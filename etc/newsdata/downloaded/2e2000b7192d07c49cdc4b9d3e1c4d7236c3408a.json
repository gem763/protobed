Jim Banks (R-IN) stood his ground in an interview with taxpayer-funded National Public Radio (NPR), defending President Donald Trump and slamming Democrats for a \u201cpolitical\u201d impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe American people have had enough,\u201d Banks said in an interview on NPR\u2019s All Things Considered on Wednesday. \u201cThey want to speak for themselves on Election Day, not allow members of Congress to overturn the will of the people through this process.\u201d\n\nBanks pointed out, as other Republicans have done, that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) decided to forgo the usual process of holding a floor vote on a House resolution on an impeachment inquiry led by the Judiciary Committee.\n\nBanks said:\n\nThere are six different committees who are taking up impeachment inquiry hearings, but at this point, we haven\u2019t gone through the normal \u2014 nothing about this is normal \u2014 but the process that impeachment is supposed to go through is for the Judiciary Committee to instruct articles of impeachment and pass it out of committee and allow every member on the floor of the House to vote on moving this forward.\n\nHe explained that the reason for not going through the normal proceedings was because \u201cthis process is entirely political.\u201d\n\nBanks also slammed Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), saying he lied about not speaking with the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d ahead of his complaint.\n\nHost Michel Martin pushed Banks on whether or not he found what Trump said on his phone call with the Ukrainian president \u201cproblematic\u201d and repeating the false claim that the president asked him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden for dealings in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cYeah, that is not an accurate description of the transcript,\u201d Banks said. \u201cI\u2019ve read the transcript. I\u2019ve read the whistleblower account.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in neither one of those documents is there something that appears to be high crimes and misdemeanors, which is what the Founding Fathers created the impeachment process to account for to begin with,\u201d Banks said. \u201cIt should only be used in extraordinary circumstances to impeach a president for high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have yet to hear an account by any Democrat on Capitol Hill of where the high crimes and misdemeanors are found in the whistleblower account or the transcript,\u201d Banks said.\n\nMartin defended her description of the phone conversation, saying she had the transcript; and, moreover, the inquiry is about interpretation of what was said.\n\n\u201cWell, I would love to hear you read the part of the transcript that would indict the president of high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d Banks said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nMartin asked whether the White House would cooperate with Congress, even if Trump released the transcript of the phone conversation in question.\n\n\u201cWell, just on your show a little bit ago, you quoted the president saying that he would cooperate,\u201d Banks said.\n\nBanks reiterated about the numerous committees investigating the president.\n\n\u201cYou have committees like the Financial Services Committee taking up the impeachment question,\u201d Banks said. \u201cWhat in the world does the Financial Services Committee have to do with impeachment?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because, again, this is all political,\u201d Banks said. \u201cThis is about Democrats that want to get in the evening news cycle and talk about impeachment and placate their left-wing base and diminish this president and cripple him going into the election in 2020.\u201d\n\nMartin\u2019s final question was about Trump defending himself on social media with \u201csome profanity\u201d and \u201cnicknames.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president deserves the opportunity to defend himself,\u201d Banks said. \u201cBut what we just learned a few hours ago about Adam Schiff lying about not talking to the whistleblower when all along he was orchestrating the whistleblower account, that\u2019s very troubling to me.\u201d\n\nBanks\u2019 final zinger in the interview was announcing that he and others have signed a motion to censure Schiff.", "description": "Rep.
