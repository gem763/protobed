The real thing is under way. The Olympic Games are getting closer by the hour. In nine months we will be on the water in Tokyo. And every second of every day between now and then will be focused on just one thing: winning.\n\nThe good news is that at the World Championships in Linz last month Great Britain qualified 10 boats for the Games. In the process we picked up two gold medals and two bronzes. I was involved in one of those, as part of the crew who came third in the eights.\n\nOur priority at Linz was qualification. So that was job done. But I will not deny that there was disappointment in bronze. We went there full of the ambition to win, but we did not. And the truth is, in the final we were never in with a shout of gold. There was open water between the Germans, who won, and us. That was hard.\n\nYou always try to take positives out of a result. But you would do well to find many from that. Looking back on the race we were just a bit meek, we were not really in it. Worse, from the heats to finals the other crews moved on in speed. We did not.
