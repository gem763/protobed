Alzheimer's makes up 60-70% of an estimated 50 million cases of dementia globally.\n\nBaird analyst Brian Skorney said an FDA approval for aducanumab is highly unlikely and expects Biogen to have an uphill climb to convince regulators that these results were nothing more than random chance.\n\nBiogen also reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit. The company's profit beat Wall Street expectations, boosted by higher demand for rare muscle disease drug, Spinraza.
