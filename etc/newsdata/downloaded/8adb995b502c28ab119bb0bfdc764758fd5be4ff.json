Calhoun, to serve as non-executive chairman.\n\n\"The board has full confidence in Dennis as CEO and believes this division of labor will enable maximum focus on running the business with the board playing an active oversight role,\" Calhoun said in a statement issued by the company.\n\nMuilenburg said in a statement that he supported splitting the CEO and chairman jobs.\n\nThe board in April opposed a shareholder resolution to split the jobs amid criticism over Boeing's response to the accidents. The measure was rejected by a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nThe Max was Boeing's best-selling plane until being grounded worldwide in March after the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The company has set aside billions to compensate airlines affected by the grounding.\n\nThe Justice Department and Congress are investigating the company, which also faces dozens of lawsuits by families of passengers who died in the crashes.\n\nOn Friday, a panel of international aviation regulators issued a report critical of Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration over how the Max was approved to fly. The group said Boeing failed to adequately inform the FAA about changes to a key flight-control system implicated in the accidents.\n\nChicago-based Boeing is one of two companies that dominate the building of large airliners; Europe's Airbus is the other. Boeing is also a major defense contractor. It has more than 150,000 employees.", "description": "Boeing announced late Friday that company directors decided to separate the two jobs and elected David L.
