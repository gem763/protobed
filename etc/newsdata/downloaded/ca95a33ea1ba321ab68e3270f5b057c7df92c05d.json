(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nAs we deal with impeachment fever, the coming election, and the absolute insanity coming from the Democratic party, all these different factors have left gaping holes between most conservatives and the beltway class that claims the same general ideology. Obsessions over decorum vs. results have become the major dividing line. When Trump cussed at his rally the other night, I didn\u2019t even have to open Twitter to know exactly who would rush to virtue signal their disapproval. Other\u2019s simply didn\u2019t care because they see a far more dangerous threat from the Democratic party in 2020 than Trump\u2019s filthy mouth.\n\nThe differences seem almost not reconcilable at this point, with some former conservative icons like George Will actively stumping for a Democrat victory. It\u2019s no coincidence that people like Will have the least to lose in that scenario.\n\nThat leads me to this thread Mollie Hemingway shared yesterday. It\u2019s written by John Hayward and perfectly captures the angst and thinking behind much of the support for Trump.\n\nI\u2019m going to lay it all out here to digest.\n\nWe hear a lot of nasty cracks from that crowd about religious conservative voters selling their souls to support Trump. Let them explain how conservative purity requires handing the country over to the left-wingers who just spent all night vowing to destroy religious freedom. \u2014 John Hayward (@Doc_0) October 11, 2019\n\nIt's not just a religious freedom issue, either. Criticize Trump however you like, but he isn't aggressively trying to use the power of the State to forcibly remake the electorate. His most aggressive uses of executive power have been efforts to PREVENT others from doing so. \u2014 John Hayward (@Doc_0) October 11, 2019\n\nI\u2019ll cut in here to say this is exactly correct. While NE corridor conservatives thumb their noses up at those icky evangelicals (and Christians in general who support Trump), they never stopped to consider the actual realities at play. The \u201cculture wars\u201d are not a new thing and conservatives got their clock cleaned during the Obama years. It\u2019s only gotten worse under Trump, as trans issues and the absolute insanity of the LGBTQ lobby have taken hold.\n\nChristians didn\u2019t vote for Trump and don\u2019t support Trump now because they are hypocrites. They are doing it for self-survival. We just had a 2020 Democrat candidate vow to punish churches who don\u2019t support same-sex marriage. Not only that, everyone in the audience cheered wildly at the idea. Not a single legacy media outlet pushed back, nor did any of the other candidates.\n\nThere is never going to be a line. They are never going to stop. That\u2019s why so many saw Trump winning, and by virtue saving the courts, as so important. George Will may not be affected, but millions of Americans feel that weight.\n\nLet\u2019s continue.\n\nThis is the core reason for \"conserving\" anything. Conservatism is not thoughtless, stubborn resistance to new ideas. It is determined resistance against the use of force to make people kneel to ideas they disagree with. It is respect for the sovereign individual. \u2014 John Hayward (@Doc_0) October 11, 2019\n\nIf you're not ready to do whatever it takes to protect the Bill of Rights, the 1st and 2nd Amendments \u2013 and that VERY CLEARLY requires defeating the Democrat candidate in 2020 by all means necessary \u2013 then in what sense are you an American \"conservative?\" \u2014 John Hayward (@Doc_0) October 11, 2019\n\nExactly. Conservatism isn\u2019t just a \u201cprinciple\u201d or ideology. It\u2019s the act of actually trying to conserve something. Any Republican that is actively throwing the game because they suppose it makes them moral or virtuous isn\u2019t conserving anything. Perhaps they can feel some personal good about that, but they also don\u2019t get to obscure the realities of their decisions.\n\nEveryone is disgusted with the NBA kowtowing to Communist China right now. Well, there isn't much difference in principle between Beijing and the Democrats on the topic of political supremacy over religion and individual conscience. The ChiComs are more brutal and efficient. \u2014 John Hayward (@Doc_0) October 11, 2019\n\nAll that snark about \"but muh judges\" reflects the same basic misunderstanding of the situation. Yes, it matters VERY MUCH to the future, indeed the very survival, of conservatism that Donald Trump has been appointing and nominating all those judges, not Hillary Clinton. \u2014 John Hayward (@Doc_0) October 11, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s no better evidence for this than how much conservatives have continued to lose the culture wars no matter who is President. The judiciary is the last line of defense. There is no backup plan, no valient media riding in on a white horse to finally sway public opinion in a fair way. So some anti-Trump conservatives can \u201cmuh judges\u201d all they want. It\u2019s those judges that will ensure we have even a fighting chance over the next several decades.\n\nAgain, the left are not going to stop. It\u2019s just a few years ago that it was considered a conspiracy theory to think Democrats might strip churches of tax exemption over teaches on homosexuality. How\u2019s that worked out? Heck, we\u2019ve went from \u201cwe aren\u2019t going to take your guns\u201d to \u201cwe support federal confiscation programs\u201d in a matter of months.\n\nOur elections are binary choices. Wishing it were not so and fantasizing about third-party ideological crusades does not change that reality. Your choice in 2020 will be between totalitarianism and whoever the GOP candidate is. The Dems are making that painfully clear. \u2014 John Hayward (@Doc_0) October 11, 2019\n\nBut once the candidates are chosen, your choices are either using all of your conservative intellect and energy to defeat the Democrat, or endorsing the use of raw government force to inflict mortal wounds on conservatism. Defense doesn't get to sit out red-zone plays. \u2014 John Hayward (@Doc_0) October 11, 2019\n\nI'm a lifelong reader of conservative publications, a fan of some people that will not like what I've written here. And I tell you: if you aren't willing to fight to conserve the most basic of American rights, I'm not that interested in hearing what you DO want to conserve. /end \u2014 John Hayward (@Doc_0) October 11, 2019\n\nThe problem is that there are a sizable amount of conservative influencers who\u2019ve grown fat and happy in the Acela Corridor that are perfectly fine with their profession becoming even more niche. They think they can ride the lightening and come out unscathed on the other end. I think they are mistaken.\n\nLook, at this point, what Hayward is saying wont move the needle with these people, but it still needs to be said. If they want to sit on the sidelines, fine. What they don\u2019t get to do is work to get a Democrat elected and then rejoin the party in 2021 as thought leaders. They don\u2019t get to pretend the consequences they are cheering on don\u2019t actually exist. They will have no grounds to complain about anything the left does and as I\u2019ve said now three times, the left are not going to stop.\n\nIf a conservative is going to go out on Twitter and wring their hands over that CNN LGTBQ+ whatever town hall last week, then they should be ready to do something to stop it from becoming a reality. If they aren\u2019t, then they aren\u2019t conserving anything. They are just keeping faux religious tenants. We\u2019ve got real religions for that.\n\nBattles don\u2019t wait for you to feel good enough about your own side to fight them.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
