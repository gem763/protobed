We are completely entitled to do that.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s fate now lies in the hands of Speaker John Bercow \u2013 who may choose not allow a meaningful vote on My Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal signed off by the EU on Thursday \u2013 as well as with rebel MPs and other EU leaders, especially French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNumber 10 is said to be hopeful other EU leaders will refuse to allow an extension.\n\nOne source said that they put the chances at \u2018about 50 per cent\u2019, adding: \u2018Macron has been particularly trenchant in private about not wanting to extend, and we hope he could take Merkel with him.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBoris' letter telling the EU a delay is not his decision The letter written by the Prime Minister stating he does not want an extension (Picture: PA)\n\nLast night, the French President\u2019s office indeed signalled that they would not back an extension, which officials said was \u2018in nobody\u2019s interest\u2019.\n\nThe Elysee Palace said given that a deal had been negotiated, \u2018it\u2019s now up to the British Parliament to say if it approves or rejects it. There must be a vote on the fundamentals.\u2019\n\nIt is understood the EU will delay any decision about an extension until a meaningful vote had been held in Westminster.\n\nThe decision could come as late as 28 October during a special EU summit \u2013 just 72 hours before the planned Brexit date.\n\nAccording to Downing Street sources, the PM spent last night making calls to EU leaders to reiterate what was said in his third letter \u2013 that the request to delay Brexit was not his.\n\nWhat Boris Johnson said in his unsigned letter to EU Council President Donald Tusk Dear Mr President, The UK Parliament has passed the European Union (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019. Its provisions now require Her Majesty\u2019s Government to seek an extension of the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty, currently due to expire at 11.00pm GMT on October 31, 2019, until 11.00pm GMT on January, 31 2020. I am writing therefore to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end at 11.00pm GMT on January 31, 2020. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early. Yours sincerely,\n\nPrime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\n\nHe told the Commons during the first Saturday sitting by MPs since the 1982 Falklands War: \u2018I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Johnson vowed to tell Europe that \u2018further delay would be bad for this country, bad for the European Union and bad for democracy\u2019.\n\nBut in a humiliating blow, he lost a key vote as MPs voted 322 to 306 to halt the approval of his Brexit deal until all necessary legislation is in place.\n\nMr Johnson looks likely to try again on Monday with a meaningful vote to get his Brexit deal through a bitterly divided Parliament.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
