She was in the wrong place at the wrong time, that's what we believe.\"\n\nMr Govan said he hoped whoever was responsible for his daughter's disappearance and suspected murder, or anyone with information, would have a conscience and come forward.\n\n\"That's what we're living for all the time - that there would be a breakthrough,\" he said.\n\nMs Govan's mother Pat said she remained anxious and upset, but fondly remembered her daughter as \"like a butterfly\" fluttering around, adding she \"lived life to the full\".\n\nShe said the whole family would be relieved if the case could be solved.\n\n\"It would be better than winning Lotto,\" she said.\n\nMr Govan said he was satisfied to a degree with the police investigation, acknowledging that detectives could not reveal too much information.\n\nIn 2017, police conducted two raids in Kalgoorlie on properties linked to bikies, and a property in Perth.\n\nPolice Commissioner Chris Dawson said at the time that people associated with the club were a focus of the investigation but not the only focus.\n\nA $250,000 reward remains on offer for information that leads to solving the suspected murder.\n\nThe family, which has previously tried using a medium to get answers, has launched a website in a bid to encourage anyone with information to come forward.\n\nThat is in addition to the Crime Stoppers plea for information.\n\nActing Commander Rod Wilde said any information, no matter how small, could provide a vital piece of the puzzle.\n\n\"We have active lines of investigation that we're working on,\" he said.\n\nThe website can be found at: https://lisagovanmissing.com.au", "description": "The family of a West Australian woman believed to have been murdered 20 years ago remain hopeful the mystery can be solved with the help of a new...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
