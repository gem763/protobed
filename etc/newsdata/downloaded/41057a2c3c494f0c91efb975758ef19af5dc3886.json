For context, the startup was founded less than a year ago with a focus on home loan refinancing, and it's written over $500 million worth of loans since launch. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nAthena Home Loans is moving into home loans \u2014 a much larger market than refinancing. Athena Cofounder and Chief Executive Nathan Walsh says that refinancing accounts for just 20% of the home loan market, and the startup will now be tackling the other 80%.\n\nHere's why Athena Home Loans' new offering is likely to see high demand:\n\nIt offers a competitive interest rate, which should spark consumer interest. Athena Home Loans is able to keep its prices low due to its digital platform, which saves it money that helps it reduce prices for customers. Further, on the back of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announcing several cash rate cuts this year, Athena Home Loans was able to drop its rate to one of the lowest on the market starting from 2.84% p.a. variable. By passing on the RBA cuts immediately, it was able to save customers over $23 million over the life of their loans. Meanwhile, Australia's 12 largest home lenders on average saw a two week delay before they passed on cuts. And the big four banks in Australia might face a new inquiry over their failure to pass on the full official interest rate cuts to consumers. This has probably lead to Athena Home Loans receiving over $1 billion worth of applications since the RBA's last rate cut on October 1.\n\nDemand for nonbank lenders in Australia is increasing. These players are now grabbing a larger share of the $1.8 trillion mortgage market in the country. Privately owned nonbank lender Firstmac, for example, reported 14% growth in its $11.6 billion mortgage loan portfolio in the year to August, while Liberty Financial revealed 24% growth, per The Sydney Morning Herald. Hence, it seems that interest in alternative lending options is picking up, and it's likely due in part to a better customer experience: Athena Home Loans, for instance, enables customers to apply for a mortgage in as little as 15 minutes via its online application process, compared with NAB, where customers have to return their application to a branch or complete the process via the phone.\n\nAustralia's fintech ecosystem is heating up, and we expect to see more fintechs scoop up large funding rounds in this fintech-friendly atmosphere. While fintech adoption in Australia is still lower than the global average, per EY, recent trends in the country indicate that the industry is picking up.\n\nNeobank Zinja, for example, recently received a banking license in the country, joining Volt, Judo, and 86 400. Additionally, the country established a committee last month that would inquire and report on fintech and regtech opportunities, barriers, and future trends in Australia. And the Customer Data Right (CDR) legislation was passed by the Australian parliament in August to provide a legal framework for its open banking regime. This fintech-friendly approach will likely spur investor interest in Australian fintechs, as startups are more likely to thrive and succeed in a forward-thinking regulatory environment.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
