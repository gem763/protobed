Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.\n\n'But you know, Ellen.'\n\nIn response to Cooper's question many named former and current colleagues from across the aisle, Bernie Sanders mentioned Utah Senator Mike Lee; Kamala Harris said Senator Rand Paul; and Tulsi Gabbard said former Representative Trey Gowdy.\n\nTwo of the candidates named Senator John McCain, Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden, who delivered a eulogy at McCain's funeral.\n\nKlobuchar, in a moving description, recounted how the late Senator, too ill to speak to her when she visited him before he died, pointed to a line in his book.\n\n'There is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself,' Klobuchar quoted.\n\nMeghan McCain later tweeted that Klobuchar's answer was 'beautiful' but many others tweeted their anger at what they perceive were wasted minutes which could have been spent scrutinizing the candidates.\n\nTwo of the candidates named Senator John McCain, Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden, who delivered a eulogy at McCain's funeral\n\nA former spokesperson for President Barack Obama, Tommy Vietor, simply wrote: 'NO. NO YOU ARE NOT CLOSING WITH AN ELLEN QUESTION.'\n\nAnd Washington Governor Jay Inslee, who had campaigned for the presidency with a focus on climate change, before dropping out, tweeted: 'Not one single question about the climate crisis.\n\n'This is the existential crisis of our time. Not one single question, and that's completely inexcusable.'", "description": "Cooper invited candidates to name a unlikely friend and used DeGeneres and Bush as an example after they were pictured laughing with each other at a Dallas Cowboys match earlier this month.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/10/19778978-0-image-a-22_1571217212536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
