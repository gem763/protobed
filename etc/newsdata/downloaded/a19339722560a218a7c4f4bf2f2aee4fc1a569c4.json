Show Hide The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis \u2013 some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.\n\nThe investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months. The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\" One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change. Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.\n\nGoogle said it was disappointed by the US decision to abandon the global climate deal, but has continued to support CEI.\n\nGoogle is also listed as a sponsor for an upcoming annual meeting of the State Policy Network (SPN), an umbrella organisation that supports conservative groups including the Heartland Institute, a radical anti-science group that has chided the teenage activist Greta Thunberg for \u201cclimate delusion hysterics\u201d.\n\nSPN members recently created a \u201cclimate pledge\u201d website that falsely states \u201cour natural environment is getting better\u201d and \u201cthere is no climate crisis\u201d.\n\nGoogle has defended its contributions, saying that its \u201ccollaboration\u201d with organisations such as CEI \u201cdoes not mean we endorse the organisations\u2019 entire agenda\u201d.\n\nIt donates to such groups, people close to the company say, to try to influence conservative lawmakers, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 to help finance the deregulatory agenda the groups espouse.\n\nA spokesperson for Google said it sponsored organisations from across the political spectrum that advocate for \u201cstrong technology policies\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hardly alone among companies that contribute to organisations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy,\u201d the spokesperson said. Amazon has, like Google, also sponsored a CEI gala, according to a programme for the event reported in the New York Times.\n\nCEI has opposed regulation of the internet and enforcement of antitrust rules, and has defended Google against some Republicans\u2019 claims that the search engine has an anti-conservative bias.\n\nBut environmental activists and other critics say that, for a company that purports to support global action on climate change, such tradeoffs are not acceptable.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get a pass on it. It ought to be disqualifying to support what is primarily a phoney climate denying front group. It ought to be unacceptable given how wicked they have been,\u201d said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator from Rhode Island who is one of the most vocal proponents of climate action in Congress.\n\n\u201cWhat all of corporate America should be doing is saying if you are a trade organisation or lobby group and you are interfering on climate, we are out. Period,\u201d he added.\n\nOn its website, Google says it is committed to ensuring its political engagement is \u201copen, transparent and clear to our users, shareholders, and the public\u201d.\n\nBut the company declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions on how much it has given to the organisations.\n\nOn a webpage devoted to \u201ctransparency\u201d, it describes the groups \u2013 among hundreds of others, including some progressive advocates such as the Center for American Progress \u2013 as having received \u201csubstantial\u201d contributions.\n\nApart from CEI, they include the American Conservative Union, whose chairman, Matt Schlapp, worked for a decade for Koch Industries and shaped the company\u2019s radical anti-environment policies in Washington; the American Enterprise Institute, which has railed against climate \u201calarmists\u201d; and Americans for Tax Reform, which has criticised companies who support climate action for seeking out \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d.\n\nIt has also donated undisclosed sums to the Cato Institute, which has voiced opposition to climate legislation and questioned the severity of the crisis. Google has also made donations to the Mercatus Center, a Koch-funded thinktank, and the Heritage Foundation and Heritage Action, a pressure group that said the Paris Aagreement was supported by \u201ccosmopolitan elites\u201d and part of Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cdestructive legacy\u201d.\n\nBill McKibben, a prominent environmentalist who has been on the frontline of the climate crisis for decades, said Google and other companies were engaged in a \u201cfunctional greenwashing\u201d given the contradiction in their public pronouncements and private donations. He said Google and other technology companies had also not used their own lobbyists to advocate for change on climate.\n\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll talk to companies and they will be going on and on about their renewable server farm or natural gas delivery, and I say thank you, but what we really need is for your lobbying shop in Washington to put serious muscle behind it. And they never do,\u201d McKibben said. \u201cThey want some tax break or some regulations switch and they never devote the slightest muscle behind the most important issue of our time or any time.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Google said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been extremely clear that Google\u2019s sponsorship doesn\u2019t mean that we endorse that organisation\u2019s entire agenda \u2013 we may disagree strongly on some issues.\n\n\u201cOur position on climate change is similarly clear. Since 2007, we have operated as a carbon neutral company and for the second year in a row, we reached 100% renewable energy for our global operations.\u201d\n\nThe company said it called for \u201cstrong action\u201d at the climate conference in Paris in 2015 and helped to sponsor the Global Climate Action summit in San Francisco last year.\n\nBut that position is at odds with the support it gives to CEI.\n\nThe group\u2019s director of energy and environment policy, Myron Ebell, helped found the Cooler Heads Coalition 20 years ago, a group of libertarian and rightwing organisations that have sowed the seeds of climate denial with funding from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nWhen Donald Trump was elected to the White House in 2016, Ebell joined the transition team and advised the new president on environmental issues, successfully lobbying Trump to adhere to a campaign promise and abandon the Paris agreement.\n\nKert Davies, the founder of the Climate Investigations Center, a research group that examines corporate campaigning, said Ebell had led the anti-climate-action crusade for decades.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re extremists,\u201d he said, referring to the Cooler Heads Coalition. \u201cThey are never finished,\u201d he said. \u201cMyron has taken a lot of credit for Trump\u2019s actions and is quite proud of his access.\u201d\n\nRecently, however, Ebell \u2013 who declined a request for an interview \u2013 has criticised the White House for not rolling back environmental protections aggressively enough, even though the Trump administration has gutted every major environmental act established under Obama.\n\nHis wishlist now includes reversing a 2009 finding by the Environmental Protection Agency that CO 2 and other greenhouse gases endanger the health and welfare of Americans.\n\nCEI said it \u201crespects the privacy of its donors\u201d and declined to answer questions about Google. A CEI spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cOn energy policy, CEI advances the humanitarian view that abundant and affordable energy makes people safer and economies more resilient. Making energy accessible, especially for the most vulnerable, is a core value.\u201d\n\nOne source who is familiar with Google\u2019s decision-making defended the company\u2019s funding of CEI.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to regulation of technology, Google has to find friends wherever they can and I think it is wise that the company does not apply litmus tests to who they support,\u201d the source said.", "description": "Firm\u2019s public calls for climate action contrast with backing for conservative thinktanks", "authors": ["Stephanie Kirchgaessner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e862d8205ee09447f1159588b2d921e9f2bca33c/0_380_6708_4025/master/6708.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5b3e6e856c8f9c81f15edb36470aa6d5", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
