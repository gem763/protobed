Visit any news site this afternoon and you\u2019re apt to find reports of a mass jailbreak at a prison where hundreds of ISIS sympathizers were detained or read accounts of Turkish-backed \u201cmilitias\u201d committing atrocities against captured Kurds. One particularly grisly story involves a Kurdish political leader named Hevrin Khalef. I\u2019ll let you google her to find out what happened, but be warned before you click that there may be graphic photos at the link.\n\nNewsweek reported on Friday that Turkish artillery shells had landed suspiciously close to a group of U.S. troops stationed near the town of Kobane. Why suspicious? Because, as a U.S. \u201cally,\u201d Turkey had been told exactly where American troops are based in northern Syria. We want to avoid friendly-fire incidents so we give them our positions and tell them to steer clear.\n\nSo how\u2019d a bunch of Turkish shells end up \u201cbracketing\u201d the American contingent in Kobane?\n\nOne Army officer who has deployed to northeastern Syria and has knowledge of the situation said that multiple rounds of 155 mm fire were launched from Turkey\u2019s side of the border and that they had a \u201cbracketing effect\u201d in which shells landed on both sides of the U.S. outpost. \u201cThat\u2019s an area weapon,\u201d the officer said, noting its explosive effects. \u201cThat\u2019s not something we ever would have done to a partner force.\u201d The officer said Turkey knew there were Americans on the hill and that it had to be deliberate. The service members vacated the outpost after the incident but returned Saturday, according to a U.S. official and images circulating on social media. \u201cWe had been there for months, and it is the most clearly defined position in that entire area,\u201d the officer said.\n\nThe Americans stationed at the outpost surely would have recognized that they were being targeted, said Ruben Gallego, an Iraq war vet turned Democratic member of Congress. A U.S. defense official asked about the incident told WaPo that the Turkish shelling was certainly \u201creckless\u201d and possibly intentional, and acknowledged that they \u201cobviously\u201d were told by the Pentagon beforehand that American soldiers were there. That\u2019s not the only pressure the Turks are putting on U.S. troops in the region either:\n\nU.S. troops pulled out from their base in the town [of Ain Issa], as Turkish-backed Syrian rebels consolidated their hold over a vital highway nearby, cutting the main U.S. supply route into Syria and isolating troops based further west\u2026 Turkish-backed rebels have set up checkpoints on the highway near Ain Issa, cutting off the U.S. troops in bases to the west, in the Syrian cities of Manbij and Kobane. Those troops came under Turkish artillery fire Friday night in what some U.S. soldiers suspect was a deliberate attempt to drive them away from the bulk of the U.S. forces farther east, Kurdish and U.S. officials said.\n\nSo that explains the shelling. The Turks were deliberately trying to divide U.S. forces, increasing the pressure on Trump to flee the area before any Americans end up \u201caccidentally\u201d isolated and/or killed. Looks like the tactic worked: SecDef Mark Esper announced this morning that all 1,000 American troops based in northern Syria will be withdrawing, leaving the Turks free to pursue their goal of massacring the Kurds without having to worry about any U.S. soldiers wandering into the line of fire.\n\nWATCH: .@EsperDoD on the planned evacuation of U.S. troopers in northern Syria.\n\n\"I spoke with the president last night after discussions with the rest national security team and he directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria.\" pic.twitter.com/2Ma0XmypfP \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) October 13, 2019\n\nAccording to one Kurdish official, the ISIS flag has already been raised in the countryside between Ain Issa and the Turkish border. Jake Tapper puts it bluntly:\n\nUS official tells @npwcnn that the campaign to defeat ISIS in Syria is \u201cover for now\u201d and that ISIS \u201chas a second lease on life with nearly 100,000 [people] who will re-join their jihad.\u201d In this official\u2019s opinion, \u201cUS policy has failed.\u201d \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 13, 2019\n\nEsper acknowledged this morning that he\u2019s also heard reports that Turkish forces or their proxies or both are committing war crimes. Fox News hears the same thing:\n\nBREAKING NEWS: Steve Harrigan joined us live this morning on FOX News Sunday to report on the ground with the latest from Syria. New video is emerging showing Turkish-backed militants killing Kurdish fighters. #FNS pic.twitter.com/u5XNF7lVYI \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) October 13, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s response to all of this has been to anxiously tweet out every conceivably line of spin in quick succession and hope something sticks. There\u2019s the \u201cwar is bad but at least our guys are safe\u201d take:\n\nVery smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s the \u201cwho cares?\u201d take:\n\n\u2026..The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nAnd there\u2019s the \u201cwe might act if this keeps up\u201d take:\n\nDealing with @LindseyGrahamSC and many members of Congress, including Democrats, about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey. Treasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nIf Obama had let Erdogan strong-arm him into handing over the Kurds to Turkey and then followed that up by ordering a full retreat after the Turks shelled American troops, citizen Trump would have tweeted that not only is he the weakest man we\u2019ve ever had as president, he may be the weakest man the country\u2019s ever produced. He\u2019d already be accusing Obama \u2014 accurately \u2014 of having midwifed the rebirth of ISIS, with the U.S. destined to get sucked into another \u201cendless war\u201d a few years from now when American troops are needed to beat back ISIS\u2019s newly expanding caliphate. The Kurds won\u2019t be helping next time either; given the hard lesson they\u2019re learning right now, their best bet after ISIS regroups will be to try to reach an accommodation with the jihadis. If the White House is worried about ISIS targeting the west, it\u2019ll have to deal with the problem directly next time.\n\nBut that\u2019s okay. Trump might be out of office by then. It\u2019ll be the next president\u2019s problem, with citizen Trump tweeting disingenuously from the sidelines that he had ISIS completely defeated until President Warren\u2019s \u201cweakness\u201d allowed them to rebuild. Most of his fans will even believe it. Think of this as the foreign policy equivalent of one of his corporate bankruptcies: He tried something, it didn\u2019t work out, and now a bunch of other people will be stuck cleaning it up. He\u2019ll be fine.\n\nHere he is on Friday being asked why, if he\u2019s all about \u201cending endless wars,\u201d he\u2019s sending 1,800 American troops to Saudi Arabia while he retreats in Syria. Simple answer: Saudi Arabia is willing to cut us a check. If the Kurds want to make us an offer, maybe our mercenary army will reconsider its retreat.
