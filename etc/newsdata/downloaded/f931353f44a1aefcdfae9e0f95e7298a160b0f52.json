However, the index had an even more significant decline yesterday, sharply falling by 3.8% in value.\n\nWe all know that the auto sector is in the midst of its worst slump. The sales for the Auto sector continue to decline by more than 30% for the last few months on a year-over-year basis.

However, the markets now believe that the tax rate cuts may be only given temporarily at most because the government\u2019s fiscal condition is already stretched. India\u2019s GST collections have dropped to Rs 98,202 crore in August from over Rs 1.02 lakh crore in July. Further rate cuts will make it difficult for the government to meet its fiscal deficit target of 3.3% for FY 2019-20. There is also a fear among states that auto companies may not pass the full benefit of GST rate cuts to consumers.\n\nThe auto stocks also suffered from a sudden spike in crude oil prices of 15% on Monday due to attacks on two Saudi oil facilities. Higher levels of crude oil will impact the petrol and diesel prices in India as well, further increasing the vehicle ownership cost to consumers. In a slow-growth environment, increase in vehicle ownership costs will force consumers further away from buying automobiles.\n\nStocks of big auto companies such as Tata Motors (NS: ), Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (NS: ) and Bajaj Auto (NS: ) all suffered from a steep decline of 5.1%, 4.4%, and 3.5% respectively in yesterday\u2019s trade.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: Crude Oil WTI Futures, Nifty 50, Nifty Auto, Bajaj Auto Ltd.
