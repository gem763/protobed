Yet, ASIC and APRA continue to impose more regulations or create confusion about existing ones, as in the case of responsible lending.\n\nAttached to the taskforce\u2019s report was an appendix prepared by a psychologist, Elizabeth Arzadon, who was contracted by ASIC to sit in the boardrooms of selected large companies and examine the \u201cmindset\u201d of directors.\n\nDirectors will be relieved to hear ASIC is not going to make psychologists in the boardroom a permanent feature of its supervision.\n\nHer report provides another lashing for directors. It says directors at some companies have limited time for unstructured discussion, are approaching ethical questions from the wrong angle, are operating without sufficient \u201cpsychological safety\u201d, are suffering from unconscious bias and not speaking directly and forcefully enough to management.\n\nArzadon identified mindsets and behaviours common to all boards and then categorised four different archetypes or models as a way of helping NEDs think about the strengths and weaknesses associated with managing non-financial risks.\n\nDirectors will be relieved to hear that ASIC is not going to make psychologists in the boardroom a permanent feature of its supervision of corporations.\n\nHowever, Shipton said Arzadon\u2019s report should be a helpful resource for companies \u201cin identifying their own behavioural style so that they can maximise the effectiveness of that style\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChanticleer is often asked why anyone would want to be a non-executive director. The prevailing view among many existing and former directors is that the Hayne royal commission report and the accompanying explosion in rules and regulations imposed on NEDs have made it almost impossible for directors to fulfil community expectations of their role.\n\nYou would think all this would discourage people from wanting to gain entry to boardrooms.\n\nBut the AICD has never had more interest in its education programs for aspiring company directors. Recently an AICD course on governance was sold out in half an hour \u2013 3000 people signed up to take part.\n\nShipton told the AICD conference in Sydney there was no \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to governance. But he urged directors to put in place structures and information flows to seek out the \"known unknowns\" that might otherwise endanger their business.\n\nHe spoke straight after respected director Graham Bradley, who delivered his annual update on how the year had unfolded for executive directors and how 2020 was looking.\n\nBradley reminded the audience that the response to the Hayne commission was typically Australian in that it resulted in the creation of a new regulator and the imposition of lots more regulation.\n\nBut the fact that it was standing room only for the speeches by Bradley and Shipton suggests that NEDs are not scared about wading into a world increasingly wrapped in excessive red tape.", "description": "A new ASIC report into managing non-financial risks should prompt aspiring new directors to think again.
