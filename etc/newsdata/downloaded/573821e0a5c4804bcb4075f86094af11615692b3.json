The continent\u2019s population is projected to double by 2050, and could double again by 2100, the U.N. has said.\n\nThe IIAG interim report said that while African governments have made some progress in improving infrastructure since 2014, on average they were lagging well behind their ambitions to revamp their economies.\n\n\u201cAfrican governments have on average not managed to translate GDP growth into economic opportunities for citizens,\u201d it said. \u201cProgress since 2014 runs behind the rapidly growing working age population.\u201d\n\nThe report noted more progress in health and nutrition, saying countries were making strong strides in combating communicable diseases and child and maternal mortality rates.\n\nHowever, providing affordable quality healthcare for all citizens was still far off and the rising spread of undernourishment was a major area of concern, it added.\n\nResearchers also criticised the widespread lack of key data across the continent, which impedes the ability of policymakers to monitor progress and adapt accordingly, saying vital population statistics had deteriorated significantly in recent years.\n\nThe report said just eight African countries had a birth registration system that covered 90% or more of the population over the last decade, and only three countries had a corresponding death registration system.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s \u2018data gap\u2019 needs to be urgently addressed,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis will create an environment conducive to sustainable and equitable development, ensuring no one is left behind.\u201d", "description": "The quality of education and training provided by African countries has worsened since 2014, leaving many of the continent's growing population of young people ill-prepared to enter the job market, an influential report said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
