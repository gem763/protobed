The meeting preceded Monday\u2019s launch of the World Radiocommunication Conference, a United Nations-affiliated conclave where the Palestinians will seek oversight of Israeli actions.\n\nNegotiations over standards and spectrum for new fifth-generation systems will be a major focus of the gathering, held once every four years. The U.S., citing security considerations, hopes to nail down leadership over the Chinese in 5G, and an Israeli-Palestinian dispute could undercut its efforts to keep the conference\u2019s focus on next-generation technology.\n\nThe U.S. has played a role in the past in pushing for upgrades to the Palestinian telecom infrastructure, and the American Embassy welcomed the talks between Israeli and Palestinian officials, saying it hoped they will \u201cyield results that improve the lives of everyday individuals who want peace.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Control\n\nIsrael has kept a tight grip on broad aspects of the Palestinian information and communications technology sector even after ceding some powers to the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo peace accords of the 1990s. The Palestinians say Israel\u2019s control of frequencies and telecoms infrastructure violates its commitment under those agreements to let them develop their own communications sector.\n\nThe inadequate frequencies and outdated technology have cost Palestinian telecom firms and the broader economy. While Israel prepares to implement 5G, the West Bank only moved to 3G last year and Gaza remains on 2G. Palestinian officials also want more frequency to allow for a third operator, in addition to Palestine Telecommunications Co., or Paltel, and Qatar-based Ooredoo.\n\nAt the same time, Israeli operators are benefiting since many Palestinians use unauthorized Israeli SIM cards because of the better service they offer, and 7amleh, a Palestinian advocacy group, says Israel also conducts mass surveillance of Palestinian communications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now facing a very big problem with the Israeli side,\u201d said Ishaq Sider, the Palestinian minister of telecom and information technology, in an Oct. 22 interview at his Ramallah office. \u201cIt is not a political issue, it is a humanitarian issue to make the life of the people easier.\u201d\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nThe Palestinians aren\u2019t persuaded by Israel\u2019s justifications of restrictions on security grounds. A spokesman for Israel\u2019s Ministry of Communications declined an interview request and said it would convey its position via appropriate channels.\n\nThe joint technical committee of Israeli and Palestinian officials that met last Thursday was established under the Oslo accords to coordinate decisions on topics like frequency assignment and equipment imports, but has convened infrequently since 2000, according to a 2016 World Bank report.\n\n\u201cNeighboring bodies need to coordinate,\u201d said Daniel Rosenne, director general of Israel\u2019s Ministry of Communications between 1996 and 2001. \u201cThe practical problems there are often not trivial.\u201d\n\nAt their meeting, the sides discussed upgrading the West Bank to 4G and 5G, and bringing 3G to Gaza, according to Samer Ali, international relations director for the Palestinian Telecom Ministry. Israel said it would study the possibility of bringing 4G and 5G to the West Bank, and agreed to have a panel discuss the frequency spectrum, he said. Approving 3G for Gaza is on the table, but awaits the formation of Israel\u2019s next government, Ali added.\n\n\u201cBottom line we didn\u2019t get anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect to get anything directly from the Israeli side.\u201d\n\nPalestinians have increasingly sought to use international bodies to find leverage as peace efforts stagnate, and along with other Arab states plan to ask the World Radiocommunication Conference to approve third-party monitoring of Israel\u2019s compliance with its commitments.\n\n\u201cIt means higher costs, it means more complications, it means your cycle for expanding your network is out of your control,\u201d said Ammar Aker, chief executive officer of Paltel, which has more than 3 million subscribers and about $400 million in annual revenue. \u201cWe work directly on all fronts to push things forward.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Saud Abu Ramadan.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ivan Levingston in Tel Aviv at ilevingston@bloomberg.net;Fadwa Hodali in Ramallah at fhodali@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lin Noueihed at lnoueihed@bloomberg.net, Amy Teibel, Mark Williams\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Palestinian Authority wants Israel to ease roadblocks stalling the upgrade of its telecommunications infrastructure, and is using a global regulatory gathering to pressure it to cooperate.For the first time since 2015, Palestinian and Israeli officials met last week to discuss proposed", "authors": ["Ivan Levingston", "Fadwa Hodali"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nuLOeM_nbfO8F55tLsZikA--~B/aD03NTA7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/b21e15490df3dea90b1b6dfea9692ca4", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
