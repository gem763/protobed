So the red-clad, towel-waving ticket holders arrived at Nationals Park on Sunday with the modest expectation of watching Washington carry a 3-2 Series lead back to Houston.\n\nMaking matters worse: Ace Max Scherzer was scratched from his scheduled Game 5 start with spasms in his right trapezius and neck. The far less heralded Joe Ross got the start instead.\n\n\"I'm worried now. Very worried,\" said Jeff Carter, who was wearing a Scherzer replica jersey.\n\nAccompanied by his daughter Alexa, Carter shelled out $1,400 to secure a pair of standing room tickets for their first World Series game.\n\n\"We thought we could see Max clinch it,\" Jeff said, shaking his head.\n\nDressed in full-body baby shark outfits purchased online, Allison and Ryan Paulsen were just thankful to be part of the scene.\n\n\"After they got off to that great start (winning the first two games), we were worried we might not get to see a game,\" Ryan said. \"Then we thought we might see the clincher. We're still optimistic, but less excited.\"\n\nKimberly Scheetz, 54, was \"very confident\" that Washington would regain control in the Series. Then she was informed that Scherzer would not be pitching.\n\n\"Hold on then,\" she said. After taking a moment to mull it over, she said with little conviction, \"I'm hopeful to see Joe Ross rise to the occasion.\"\n\nSUZUKI BETTER\n\nNationals catcher Kurt Suzuki missed a second straight start with a hip flexor strain, but he's feeling better and should be ready to go in Game 6 following an off day Monday, manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nSuzuki sustained the injury while chasing a pitch from behind the plate. Yan Gomes started at catcher.\n\nCAN'T STOP HIM\n\nThe smallest man on the field has one of the lengthiest streaks in postseason history.\n\nJos\u00e9 Altuve reached base in 24 straight playoff games through Saturday, the longest run in franchise history and third-longest ever in the American League. If he kept it going Sunday, Altuve he would tie Boog Powell for second place behind Miguel Cabrera (31).\n\nHis streak started in Game 7 of the 2017 World Series.\n\nThe 5-foot-6 star was batting .365 this postseason through Saturday. With two hits in Game 4, Altuve became the first second baseman to have three straight multihit games in the Series since Mark Lemke in 1991.\n\nAltuve and Michael Brantley form a formidable 2-3 punch in the Houston lineup.\n\n\"The quality of their bats, specifically in the World Series, has been second to none,\" manager AJ Hinch said.\n\nBIG TRAIN GRANDSON\n\nThe last time Washington won a World Series was in 1924, when Walter Johnson won Game 7 against the New York Giants.\n\nThe Big Train's grandson, Henry Thomas, was at the ballpark Sunday, wearing a throwback Senators jacket and rooting for the current incarnation of Washington's baseball team.\n\n\"As a fan, it's important for the legacy of baseball to have a team here,\" said Thomas, who paid face value for his $340 ticket.\n\nThomas literally wrote the book on his grandfather, penning \"Walter Johnson: Baseball's Big Train\" in 1998.\n\nIT'S BEEN A WHILE\n\nBefore this week, the Nationals had not lost two straight since Sept. 13-14. Between that two-game skid in the regular season and their successive World Series setbacks, Washington went 22-5.\n\nThere was no panic entering Game 5.\n\n\"Calm, comfortable,\" is how reliever Sean Doolittle described the mood in the clubhouse after Saturday's 8-1 defeat.\n\n__\n\nMore AP MbLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "Nationals fans adjust sights after two-game skid means World Series headed back to Houston", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04adc14fd5acc7b1e80da2e3a802837ce3b404d4/c=0-264-5078-3120/local/-/media/2019/10/27/USATODAY/usatsports/02b61bdf65014385bff299694bd9925d.jpg?width=3200&height=1800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
