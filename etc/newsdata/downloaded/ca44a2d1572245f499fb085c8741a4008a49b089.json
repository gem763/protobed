Expectations for us are at a completely different level now. We have to win every time and it's the same feeling we have as players as well.\n\n'We as players must try to keep all the negative things completely out. But the reason for our results is actually hard to answer. We can't close the matches, even though we are ahead. But we have also been unlucky.'\n\nEriksen dismissed the notion that transfer speculation around himself and other players is the reason behind the sluggish start to the season.\n\nThe Dane struggled to exert any influence at the AMEX stadium at the weekend where Tottenham were easily brushed aside by Brighton in a 3-0 win.\n\nHaving been one of Tottenham's most impressive performers in recent seasons, Eriksen's influence has waned in recent months with talk over his decision not to sign a new contract dominating the narrative.\n\nHe has featured in 11 matches so far this season and has produced just one goal and one assist.", "description": "Eriksen made no secret of his desire to leave the club in the summer, with Real Madrid credited with an interest, and he has had to try and win back some supporters who felt his heart was not in the club.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/11/19437138-0-image-a-41_1570529106498.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
