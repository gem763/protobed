We can't drink that! It's filthy! And there's hardly any of it.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old, now a mum-of-two, suggested to Melissa that they would have to learn Spanish and understand the rules, the Mail on Sunday reports.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe pair even talked to a fellow inmate who shared her story of how she murdered her boyfriend's girlfriend and a baby then served the infant in a stew.\n\nMichaella's case was fast-tracked in 2013 after she learned that she had brought a lot of 'unwanted attention' to Peru's legal system.\n\nA guilty plead gave McCollum and Reid an exchange for six years and eight months rather than the 15-year stretch she had feared.\n\n(Image: Michaella McCollum/Instagram)\n\nIn her book You'll Never See Daylight Again, which is published at the end of the month, McCollum recounts how she got involved in smuggling as a 20-year-old.\n\nShe said she even took the opportunity to run a prisoner's beauty salon in a bid to prove her trustworthiness.\n\nMcCollum was released on March 31 2016, and returned to Ireland in August that year.\n\nShe is set to profit from sales of her tell-all book, and has reportedly held talks about turning it into a TV series.", "description": "Michaella McCollum said she had to keep herself hydrated by drinking water in a jug next to a toilet pit after being jailed over a \u00a31.5million cocaine smuggling plot", "authors": ["Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Reuters", "Michaella Mccollum Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20734196.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Michaella-McCollum.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
