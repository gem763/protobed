To prepare, the National Weather Service issued an \u201cextreme red flag\u201d warning, a label that meteorologists told the Los Angeles Times \u201cthey can\u2019t remember even using.\u201d\n\nAround 6 a.m., a brush fire in Simi Valley \u2014 about 30 miles north of Malibu \u2014 broke out; within four hours, the Easy Fire was threatening 7,000 homes and had grown to around 1,300 acres. By the early afternoon, 1,000 buildings were threatened by the fire, and 26,000 Ventura County residents were under evacuation orders.\n\nLike other L.A.-area blazes in recent years that have threatened notable California landmarks including the Getty Center and Kanye West\u2019s house, the Easy Fire was soon encroaching on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. The largest presidential library in the nation sits on a hill covered in heavy brush, which is managed in part by a herd of hundreds of goats employed to minimize the vegetation that could fuel wildfires.\n\nVentura County fire chief Mark Lorenzen noted that flames got within 50 feet of the buildings, though firefighters were able to prevent any damage thanks to multiple airdrops and built-in firebreaks. The Easy Fire did get close enough to be seen from the glass-encased pavilion housing Reagan\u2019s presidential plane, providing another image of the eerie, untenable balance of exurban life in Southern California as the fire season become a full-year event.\n\n#RT @IAFFNewsDesk: RT @LimaDvp10IAFF: Fast-moving 'Easy' fire grows quickly, triggers evacuations in Simi Valley.

Though over 5,000 wildfires had been reported through October 27, total damage from this fire season is expected to be a tenth of the 2018 total.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
