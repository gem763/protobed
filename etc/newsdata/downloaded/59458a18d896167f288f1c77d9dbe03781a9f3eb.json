As artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) continues to infiltrate different aspects of our day-to-day lives, the technology is now doing more than ever \u2014 for both good and bad.\n\nThis necessitates an ethical use of such solutions to prevent misuse, and ensure there\u2019re adequate controls over the massive amounts of data accessed by these algorithms.\n\nThe data trust, therefore, acts as a \u201csteward\u201d that gets to approve and control the collection of, and manage access to, data with an eye on privacy while not sacrificing the benefits of AI and ML.\n\nIn other words, a data trust \u2014 say, an independent watchdog agency \u2014 sets the terms of data collection, usage, and sharing, in addition to deciding who gets to access said information in a way that balances privacy and responsible use of technology.\n\nThe idea of a data trust is not new. Google\u2019s sister company Sidewalk Labs \u2014 which released blueprints for its controversial Quayside smart city in Toronto back in June \u2014 has set up a data governance model that places \u201curban data\u201d under the control of an independent Civic Data Trust.\n\nThe gathered data, according to the planned digital governance model, will not be sold, used for advertising, or shared without people\u2019s permission. But the proposals have also courted surveillance concerns.\n\nPrivacy in the time of surveillance capitalism\n\nWith tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft becoming the de facto data monarchs of personal information, the idea that they can potentially use your data without actually having it is sure an appealing one.\n\nIt\u2019s a widely accepted fact that most smart technologies today \u2014 be it data-driven, internet-connected, or automated \u2014 are rife with privacy issues.\n\nEven as the battle to keep personal data private rages on, it\u2019s expected of netizens to give up some level of privacy as the cost of admission for all the conveniences of the digital world, so much so that the existing framework begins to feel like mere band-aid solutions.\n\nThe tacit agreement between individuals and the powerful digital institutions that profit from the data gathered by profiling its users has led to a privacy paradox, with users left with no choice but to hit \u201caccept\u201d and move on.\n\nIt\u2019s therefore essential that new methods are developed to address the aforementioned disconnect and decouple personal data from the companies who need them in order to offer their services.\n\nWhether it\u2019s by making individuals \u201cdata shareholders,\u201d offering privacy as a paid service, or entrusting data in the hands of an independent \u201cdata trust,\u201d it\u2019s time to address the need for owning personal data so that privacy can be what it is \u2014 a fundamental human right that cannot be taken or given away.\n\nRead next: You need a \u2018zero-trust\u2019 strategy to protect your business from cyberattacks", "description": "Mozilla, the nonprofit behind the free and open-source Firefox web browser, is partnering with Montreal-based Element AI to push for ethical use of AI.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F05%2Fartificial-intelligence-hed.jpg&signature=2071957d3a574e19d518225b06a50c51", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
