While the WFP\u2019s decision to back the senator from Massachusetts for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination drew lots of attention Monday, the group first endorsed Warren in February 2015, when it called on the senator\u2014as \u201cthe nation\u2019s most powerful voice for working families\u201d\u2014to challenge front-runner Hillary Clinton for the party\u2019s 2016 nomination. Warren chose not run, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders stepped up. The WFP eventually backed his bid, with a December 2015 announcement from party leadership that \u201cwe\u2019re standing with Bernie Sanders to build the political revolution and make our nation into one where every family can thrive.\u201d Ad Policy\n\nNow the WFP is again with Warren. That\u2019s significant, as is the fact that it isn\u2019t with Sanders. Significant is not necessarily the same as definitional, however. Many friends and allies of the WFP were still speaking up for the senator from Vermont after the announcement Monday that the senator from Massachusetts had prevailed in endorsement balloting in which 50 percent of the vote was cast by WFP members and grassroots supporters and 50 percent by the WFP national committee.\n\nThe WFP\u2019s decision to endorse distinguished it from the majority of progressive groups and unions, which are waiting to make choices between Warren and Sanders, and the several other contenders who lay claim to the progressive mantle in 2020. (New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, former secretary of housing and urban development Julian Castro, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio were also in the running for the WFP nod.) There have been few major endorsements so far even from the left-leaning labor, environmental, and activist groups that in 2015 first cheered on a \u201cDraft Warren\u201d movement and then backed Sanders\u2014although the Vermonter has gained endorsements from Democratic Socialists of America, Progressive Democrats of America and, more recently, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America union.

Sanders backers expressed doubts that this would happen. They also pointed out that while Sanders once declared that \u201cthe WFP is the closest thing there is to a political party that believes in my vision of democratic socialism,\u201d the party\u2019s endorsements of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo over Democratic primary rival Zephyr Teachout in 2014 and of New York Representative Joe Crowley against challenger Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a 2018 primary had drawn criticism from progressives. (Notably, the party backed Cynthia Nixon\u2019s 2018 from-the-left challenge to Cuomo, and earned high marks for throwing in early with the 2019 campaign of Tiffany Caban for Queens district attorney.)\n\nThe WFP vote illustrated the challenges that arise when two favorites of progressives are running against one another. Sanders won almost 90 percent of the vote against Clinton in the WFP endorsement vote four years ago. This time the WFP announced that\u2014\u201dafter a three-month endorsement process in which tens of thousands participated in debate and discussion, online forums, house parties, and live Q&As with five contenders for the Democratic nomination\u2026. The two highest vote-getters were Senator Warren with 60.91% of the vote, and 35.82% for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. More than 80% of voters listed Warren and Sanders as their top two picks.\u201d\n\nThat was good news for Warren on several levels. The endorsement drew lots of attention from media outlets that barely covered the WFP\u2019s 2015 decision. Beyond the media coverage of the endorsement itself was the fact that it came at a moment when many progressives are starting to talk about when they will have to make choices between two senators whose combined poll support consistently tops that attained by former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nWFP national director Maurice Mitchell argues that the time is now. He couched this assessment in the kindest terms, speaking about \u201cthe tough choice progressives face this year,\u201d noting that the WFP still considers Sanders \u201ca crucial ally in the fight for a more just world\u201d and expressing hope that Warren and Sanders will continue to align during the primary campaign as \u201ca formidable duo on the campaign trail, organizing voters behind full-throated progressive messages.\u201d Current Issue View our current issue\n\n\u201cBut in the end,\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cwe believe this campaign is too important to sit on the sidelines.\u201d\n\nJoe Dinkin, the national campaign director for the party that started in New York but now organizes and campaigns in more than a dozen states nationwide, echoed that theme. \u201cThe right-wing is organized and they\u2019re working for their candidate Donald Trump,\u201d said Dinkin. \u201cThe corporate wing of the Democratic Party is working for their candidate: Joe Biden. And we just could not sit on the sidelines. We have to start organizing to make sure that the Democrats nominate and elect a progressive candidate.\u201d\n\nWarren posted a video of herself throwing her hands up in celebration after the endorsement was announced. She also headed for a Monday evening rally that drew thousands to Washington Square Park in New York City\u2014the urban base from which the union-aligned WFP began working more than two decades ago on an inside-outside strategy to move the Democratic Party to the left on economic, social, and racial justice issues. Her campaign left little doubt that it would make everything it could of the endorsement from a prominent progressive group.\n\nBut plenty of WFP allies responded to the endorsement of Warren with kind words and shows of solidarity for Sanders. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m proud of my work with @WFP, I still believe @BernieSanders is the best choice for working families because of his stance on CJR, M4A, Economic Justice and #NoMiddleGround,\u201d tweeted Milwaukee County (WI) Supervisor Marcelia Nicholson.\n\n\u201cI love all that the @WorkingFamilies does,\u201d declared Randy Bryce, a Wisconsin labor activist and 2018 congressional candidate who ran with early and enthusiastic support from WFP. \u201cI just have to add as a longtime Bernie Sanders supporter that up to this point he has been the most pro-labor candidate that we have.\u201d Jacobin founder Bhaskar Sunkara observed, \u201cThe [WFP] has changed New York politics fundamentally and for the better but their decision to endorse Warren is baffling. Bernie is the national manifestation of the WFP\u2019s politics. The fact that the WFP doesn\u2019t recognize that reflects how much it has strayed.\u201d\n\nSunkara argued that the WFP should release breakdowns of the voting among grassroots members and supporters\u2014who many Sanders backers believe to be more sympathetic to their candidate than the leaders of WFP-aligned groups who serve on the national committee. \u201cIt may not reveal a plurality for Sanders,\u201d suggested Sunkara, \u201cbut it definitely shows a divided base.\u201d WFP leaders said they would not release the breakdowns.\n\nWith an eye toward competing for votes from folks who have been engaged with the WFP in New York and other states over the years, the Sanders campaign struck a reconciling note. Instead of complaining, they sent a statement to The Nation from campaign manager Faiz Shakir that read, \u201cThe Bernie Sanders campaign is built from the support of millions of working people across the country, with our leading donors being Walmart workers, teachers, and nurses. We look forward to working with the Working Families Party and other allies to defeat Donald Trump. Together, we\u2019ll build a movement across the country to transform our economy to finally work for the working class of this country.\u201d", "description": "A lot of progressive groups (and voters) have held off on making the Sanders-vs.-Warren choice.
