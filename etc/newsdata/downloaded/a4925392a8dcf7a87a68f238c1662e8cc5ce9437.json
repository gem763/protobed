Gregory Meeks (@RepGregoryMeeks) October 22, 2019\n\nAt least five House Democrats talked about a \u201clynching\u201d or \u201clynch mob\u201d as pertaining to Clinton, according to a Fix review.\n\n\u201cThe highest officeholder should think about these words. The rural south where I was born has a tarnished and painful history,\u201d Rep. Danny K. Davis (D-Ill.) tweeted Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect Trump to be sensitive to the weight of that word, or see how insulting and hurtful it is to invoke it here,\u201d Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) tweeted Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1998, however, both Davis and Meeks called the Clinton impeachment proceedings a \u201clynching\u201d on the House floor the day before the president was impeached. Then-Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) described what he called a \u201clynch mob mentality, that says this man has to go\u201d during a floor speech the same day.\n\nDemocratic criticisms of the Republican-led impeachment proceedings against Clinton were not limited to the House floor.\n\nThen-Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.) called the impeachment proceedings against Clinton a \u201cpartisan lynching\u201d during an October 1998 appearance on CNN. On Tuesday, Biden called Trump\u2019s tweet \u201cabhorrent.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It\u2019s despicable,\u201d Biden tweeted.\n\nOn three occasions in 1998, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who now chairs the committee that would consider articles of impeachment against Trump, called the impeachment process against Clinton a \u201clynch mob.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t participate in a lynch mob against the president,\u201d Nadler told Newsday on Sept. 13, 1998.\n\nFive days later, Nadler said he saw \u201cno evidence that the Republicans want to do anything other than organize a lynch mob,\u201d according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nAnd on Oct. 4, 1998, Nadler told the Associated Press that Republicans were \u201crunning a lynch mob\u201d against Clinton.\n\nAD\n\nThen-Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.), who served nearly 20 years in the House, slammed the impeachment proceedings against Clinton during an interview with the Baltimore Sun on Sept. 12, 1998.\n\n\u201cThis feels today like we\u2019re taking a step down the road to becoming a political lynch mob,\u201d McDermott said at the time. \u201cFind the rope, find the tree and ask a bunch of questions later.\u201d\n\nMeeks acknowledged his 1998 remarks in a statement to The Fix.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYes, I said those words, but context matters. There is a difference when that word is used by someone of my experience and perspective, whose relatives were the targets of lynch mobs, compared to a president who has dog-whistled to white nationalists and peddled racism,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cThis is the birther president, who called African nations s---holes and urban cities infested. Those he called \u2018very fine people\u2019 in Charlottesville were the kind of people who lynched those who looked like me. So, yes \u2014 there are certain words I am more at liberty to invoke than Donald J. Trump.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSeveral Republicans criticized Trump for his characterization Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the language I would use,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said at a weekly news briefing.\n\n\u201cGiven the history in our country, I would not compare this to a lynching,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said at a weekly Senate news briefing. \u201cThat was an unfortunate choice of words.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats are being total hypocrites right now in response to @realDonaldTrump's tweet this morning.\n\n\n\nDem. Rep. Gregory Meeks on Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998: \"What we are doing here is not a prosecution, it is a persecution and indeed it is a political lynching.\" pic.twitter.com/5wgjuzOYQt \u2014 Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) October 22, 2019\n\nDoing an about-face on impeachment rhetoric seems to be standard practice. Trump has also called the impeachment inquiry a \u201ccoup,\u201d language that has been echoed by McCarthy, the Republican National Committee and no fewer than 18 Fox News hosts and guests, according to a Fix review. Removing a president from office via procedures outlined in the Constitution is not the same as a coup, which is defined as a violent overthrow of the government.\n\nAD\n\nAt least 11 House Democrats called the Clinton impeachment proceedings a \u201ccoup,\u201d including two of the chairmen now leading the impeachment inquiry pertaining to Trump: Nadler and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.).\n\n\u201cCoup\u201d comparisons also persisted in the years after President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s resignation stemming from impeachment proceedings. Former vice president Spiro Agnew called the process a \u201ccoup d\u2019etat\u201d in 1980, as did Nixon speechwriter Patrick J. Buchanan in 1997.\n\nAD", "description": "At least five House Democrats compared the impeachment proceedings of President Bill Clinton to a \"lynching\" or to a \"lynch mob\" in 1998.
