Bolsonaro is not someone who cares about the environment. He is someone who is in fact accelerating the deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest, and who says crazy stuff just to get the attention or cause distraction.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s comment was the result of a reporter asking him about whether Brazil can simultaneously grow more food while protecting the environment. And this question is the crucial context to understand Bolsonaro\u2019s reply: \u201cIt\u2019s enough to eat a little less. You talk about environmental pollution. It\u2019s enough to poop every other day. That will be better for the whole world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReacting to the statement, Cal Perry, a correspondent for NBC News International, tweeted a link to a BBC article on Bolsonaro\u2019s statement, arguing: \u201cAnd people say world leaders are out of touch on climate change.\u201d\n\nAnd people say world leaders are out of touch on climate change \u2026 \u201cJair Bolsonaro: 'Poop every other day' to protect the environment\u201d https://t.co/UTscq3d6nE \u2014 Cal Perry (@CalNBC) August 12, 2019\n\nBut this tweet makes no sense because no one ever said Bolsonaro was \u201cin touch\u201d on climate change \u2014 much as no one ever said President Donald Trump was.\n\nQuite the reverse. The BBC article explains the reality of what Bolsonaro is doing to the environment in Brazil. Bolsonaro\u2019s comment came after a \u201cjournalist quoted reports saying deforestation and agriculture were responsible for a quarter of the planet\u2019s greenhouse effect.\u201d The BBC also noted that the Brazilian president \u201crecently came under fire after official data showed an increase in deforestation in the Amazon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, Brazil\u2019s own National Institute for Space Research has reported that 870 square miles of the Amazon were clear-cut last month \u2014 an astounding 278% increase from a year ago. The Amazon rain forest helps combat climate change by storing vast amounts of carbon in its soil and vegetation.\n\nOn top of that, as the BBC noted, on August 2 the Brazilian president \u201csacked the head of the agency that reported the increase\u201d (emphasis in original).\n\nAnd like Trump, Bolsonaro has appointed pro-industry, anti-environmental types to run his environmental policy.\n\nGiven that context, Bolsonaro\u2019s comment is not only absurd but it would appear to be intentionally absurd. Even Fox News noted, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t clear if Bolsonaro was being sarcastic.\u201d\n\nBut in one particularly bizarre media reaction Bolsonaro\u2019s bizarre comment was that Forbes actually ran an entire column as if it were a serious solution: \u201cBrazil\u2019s President: What Is Wrong With His Poop Advice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe column opens with a question: \u201cWhat\u2019s most to blame for messing up the environment? How about you and your selfish insistence on pooping when you have to do so.\u201d\n\nIt continues in this vein, noting, \u201cTo my knowledge, Bolsonaro is not [sic] medical doctor,\u201d and \u201cThere is no established specific recommended frequency for pooping.\u201d\n\nBut the point of this column becomes clear at the end when the author poses a question about \u201chow much you eat and poop,\u201d asking: \u201cDo you really want the government to regulate you to that end? No, you can\u2019t make this poop up.\u201d\n\nOnly in a world devoid of context could Bolsonaro be used as an example of some sort of environmentalist reaching too far to regulate human behavior as opposed to what he is: \u201cBrazil\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d an anti-environmental extremist.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Brazil-President-Jair-Bolsonaro-Donald-Trump.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1"}
