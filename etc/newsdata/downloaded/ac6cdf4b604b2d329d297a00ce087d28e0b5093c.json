The officials ranged from low-level employees to senior officials who reported directly to Clinton. Former aides were sent letters letting them know that their emails were retroactively deemed \"classified\" and sharing that information could be deemed a security violation.\n\nThe investigation began 18 months ago, fizzled out and then was picked back up in August. Senior officials at the Department say they have followed standard protocol. Because the investigation began in the later days of the Obama administration, it is just now coming to an end.\n\nFormer Obama officials have said the probe is taking place for political gains.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think that this is just routine, but something strange is going on,\u201d said Jeffrey Feltman, a former assistant secretary for Near East Affairs.\n\nFeltman received a letter early last year from the Department making him aware that six of his emails included classified information. A couple weeks ago he received another letter, this one telling him he was responsible for more sending more than 50 emails that had classified information.\n\n\u201cA couple of the emails cited by State as problems were sent after my May 2012 retirement, when I was already working for the United Nations,\u201d Feltman said.\n\nCurrent state officials say the investigation has nothing to do with who is in office.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with who is in the White House,\u201d an anonymous senior State Department official told the Post. \u201cThis is about the time it took to go through millions of emails, which is about 3\u00bd years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe process is set up in a manner to completely avoid any appearance of political bias,\u201d a second official told the Post.\n\nThe investigation into Clinton's use of a private server for emails began in July of 2015 and wrapped up one year later. Then-FBI Director James Comey closed the case with no charges. Although he said Clinton and her aides' conduct was \"extremely careless,\" it wasn't criminal.", "description": "Finally..09/29/2019 19:27:29PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/60/cf2b744b-f0c4-434a-ad78-bdd0c27a37b3.png", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
