Alas, Gaveston was executed 13 years before the palace was built. \u201cIt was very nasty,\u201d Mr Johnson added, before attempting to downplay it as nothing more than a schoolboy blunder.

Completely shut down. Just him and the Irish prime minister, at a popular WAG manor house near Liverpool where Coleen Rooney had her 21st birthday party.\n\nThis time he would come up with some really deranged proposals. Ones that could never, possibly, be true.\n\nThis time he\u2019d make explicitly clear that if no deal happened it would all be Varadkar\u2019s fault. He had been prepared to compromise, he\u2019d sent over new proposals, and they\u2019d been rejected out of hand.\n\nWhat had Ireland done, what had the EU done, apart from consistently do exactly what they said they would do, for three and a half full years?\n\nWhen would they, finally, get round to bending over backwards, breaking their own rules, to help out a man who likes nothing more than to call them all Nazis for lols and a few grand a time at some corporate dinner?\n\nAll of this unimaginable mess, this unsolvable problem that he never actually thought he would ever have to solve because he never thought he would actually win the referendum, it would all be somebody else\u2019s fault.\n\nIt would be nothing to do with him at all.\n\nIt would be the EU that hadn\u2019t compromised. It would be Varadkar, refusing to do a thing to help.\n\nIt would be the Remainers. It would be Jeremy Corbyn. It would be Angela Merkel, it would be Emmanuel Macron. It would be Jean-Pierre Papin. It would be Demis Roussos, Antoine de Caunes and Goran Ivanisevic.\n\nIt would be absolutely, absolutely anybody but definitely not him.\n\nAnd if that absolute, total, garbage somehow found its way to The Sun, or The Express or The Daily Telegraph, well, he\u2019d know who to blame.\n\nHe\u2019d have held the meeting, we\u2019d have seen the photos which clearly show just one person attended it.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026.....Leo Varadkar.", "description": "For a few months now, someone has been consistently informing the press of Boris Johnson\u2019s deranged ideas for how to get out of the impossible Brexit mess that is entirely of his own making.
