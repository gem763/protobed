Companies Are Considering Magazine Subscriptions and Phone Bills When Making Loans", "language": "en", "text": "The way lenders decide who can borrow money is undergoing its biggest shift in a generation.\n\nFor decades, banks and other financiers have relied primarily on consumers\u2019 borrowing history to make lending decisions. Now revenue-hungry companies are considering metrics both mundane and peculiar, like whether applicants shop at discount stores, subscribe to magazines or pay their phone bills on time.\n\nThose experimenting with new metrics range from big-name banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Ally Financial Inc. and Discover Financial Services to upstart financial-technology firms.\n\nThe changes are an about-face for many banks, which have spent much of the decade since the financial crisis chasing mostly ultra-creditworthy customers. But that pool is only so big.\n\nThe field of potential new borrowers is huge: About 53 million U.S. adults don\u2019t have credit scores, according to Fair Isaac Corp. , creator of the widely used FICO scores. Another roughly 56 million have subprime scores. Some have a checkered borrowing history or high debt loads. But others, banks point out, just don\u2019t have traditional borrowing backgrounds, often because they are new to the U.S. or pay for most expenses with cash.\n\nDespite some signs that the economy is strong, such as low unemployment, it is also showing symptoms of wear. U.S. consumer debt is higher than ever, with many Americans forced to borrow to keep up with rising costs for cars, college, housing and medical care.\n\nChristina Segura, 24, had a low credit score from unpaid medical debts when she applied for financing from fintech startup Meritize. But the company, which funds higher education and skills-based training, used her high-school transcript to approve her for loans totaling $9,000 to attend pipe-welding school.\n\nMeritize considers factors such as improvement in grades and signs that students challenged themselves, said Chief Executive Chris Keaveney. The firm, he said, is \u201cessentially proxying grit.\u201d\n\nGovernment officials at times have encouraged or even required changes to the information in credit reports and scores, reasoning they would bring loans to deserving borrowers who might not fit a traditional mold.\n\nRelated Families Go Deep in Debt to Stay in the Middle Class\n\nDuring the past few years, lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., American Express Co. and Capital One Financial Corp. have been talking to FICO about whether incorporating new data into credit scores could boost loan volume, according to people familiar with the matter. Separately, lenders have been asking Experian PLC for ways to find new customers who are more financially responsible than their credit records suggest, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe U.S. lending industry revolves around consumer data. Lenders feed information on their customers to credit-reporting firms Experian, Equifax Inc. and TransUnion , which compile lengthy dossiers on borrowers. FICO scores condense the data in those reports\u2014such as payment track record and ratio of credit-card spending limits to owed balances\u2014into a number between 300 and 850.\n\nWhile changes at individual banks can affect slivers of consumers, the changes made by the credit industry affect a broad range of Americans.\n\nLast October, for example, FICO announced it had developed a new score\u2014UltraFICO\u2014that factors in how applicants manage the cash in their checking, savings and money-market accounts. The new score functions as a sort of appeal: If an applicant\u2019s traditional FICO score falls short, a lender can offer to have the score recalculated. About 37% of FICO\u2019s revenue comes from the credit scores it sells.\n\nAnd TransUnion says it sells alternative data to U.S. lenders that can include whether consumers subscribe to and pay for magazines. \u201cIt\u2019s an indicator of stability,\u201d said Mike Mondelli, senior vice president of global data strategy.\n\nCredit scores have been the bedrock of consumer lending for decades. Fair Isaac created the FICO score in 1989, and banks adopted it broadly in the 1990s. Investors that buy securitized consumer loans\u2014sliced-up pools of credit-card, auto and mortgage debt\u2014often rely on FICO scores to assess their risk.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What are good metrics for deciding who gets loans? Join the conversation below.\n\nCritics say the changes could make millions of borrowers appear safer than they are, diluting the value of credit scores and reports. Others say the alternative metrics, like a consumer\u2019s reliability in paying electric bills, don\u2019t translate into a likelihood they will repay their loans.\n\nConsumers with thin credit files are more likely to default on their loans, though the majority of them perform well, according to TransUnion. FICO estimates that about one-third of people who don\u2019t have credit scores had a major negative event like a bankruptcy at some point in their past.\n\nGoldman Sachs started making personal loans in 2016, part of a bigger move into consumer banking. Among other factors, it considers whether applicants overdraw their checking accounts.\n\nA Goldman Sachs spokesman said the bank has \u201cbuilt a technology and data architecture that can ingest and use multiple sources of data to make the best decisions for the customer and the bank.\u201d\n\nPer Breivik worked with his bank HSBC to obtain a U.S. credit card after relocating to Houston from London.

Per Breivik said he had a credit score in the low 300s after he moved to Houston from London last year, and had trouble getting a credit card.\n\nMr. Breivik, who runs maintenance for a drilling company, turned to HSBC Holdings PLC. \u201cI said, \u2018We need to try to work something out. I have all this history with you guys,\u2019\u201d he said, referencing deposit accounts with the bank abroad.\n\nHSBC reviewed his relationship with the bank, including his record of repaying an HSBC credit card he had before he moved to the U.S., and approved him for a U.S. card.\n\nSome lenders are working with fintechs that assess consumers\u2019 purchase data to determine risk. Fintech ZestFinance, for example, says applicants who spend more at grocery stores than on eating out tend to be a lower risk, as are those who shop at discount stores or are registered to vote.\n\nAngel Hernandez, a 42-year-old maintenance worker, used cash for almost everything for much of his adult life. He has twice tapped Spring Bank for loans to pay for funeral and travel expenses when relatives died. Spring Bank, based in the Bronx, N.Y., lends to consumers with little to no credit history.\n\nThe bank verified Mr. Hernandez\u2019s income with his employer. It also had him set up a savings account at Spring Bank where a portion of his paycheck was regularly deposited. Spring Bank made withdrawals from it to repay the loan.\n\nMr. Hernandez recently received his first credit card offers in the mail. He has since signed up for several cards.\n\nWrite to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com", "description": "The way lenders decide who can borrow money is undergoing its biggest shift in a generation.", "authors": ["Annamaria Andriotis", "Annamaria.Andriotis Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106098/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
