There\u2019s a party in the streets.\u201d\n\nThe Broad Front faced a tough challenge, with voters angered by a stagnant economy, inflation of 7.5 percent and a nine percent unemployment rate.\n\nLacalle Pou, 46, would likely win backing from historic rivals the Colorado party and also the Open Cabildo in the run-off, while Martinez has few options to form an alliance that could carry him to victory next month.\n\nAs he cast his vote in Canelones, a city north of Montevideo, Lacalle Pou said he would start preparing for the second round \u201ctomorrow\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s no time to waste.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Robbed and destroyed\u2019 \u2013\n\nDaniel Segal, a 65-year-old businessman, voted in the same polling station as Martinez but said the time has come for change and ticked Talvi\u2019s box.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the candidate with the most knowledge, the best educated. Here, these people (the Broad Front) robbed us and destroyed the country.\u201d\n\nMartinez had his supporters at the polling station, too.\n\n\u201cI have a conscience, a memory, ethic, moral and human values: that\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for the Broad Front,\u201d said Valentin Puntigliano, 18, a journalism student.\n\n\u201cThe things the Front have said haven\u2019t all helped me directly. But they\u2019ve done many good things for the rest of the population that is suffering the most,\u201d said mother-of-two Lucia Ricci, 34, who works at Montevideo\u2019s town hall.\n\nThe Broad Front is a coalition of leftist movements that in 2005 broke a near monopoly on the presidency shared by the National and Colorado parties since 1830, two years after Uruguayan independence.\n\nVazquez, the Front\u2019s first president, was succeeded by former left-wing guerrilla Jose Mujica, who became a cult figure known as \u201cthe world\u2019s poorest president\u201d \u2014 he gave away most of his salary and drove an old Volkswagen Beetle.\n\nThe next president will take office on March 1, 2020.", "description": "Montevideo (AFP) \u2013 The leftist ruling coalition\u2019s presidential candidate Daniel Martinez was ahead in Uruguay\u2019s general election on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/a1c70f_daniel-martinez-candidate-uruguay-leftist-broad-governing-coalition-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
