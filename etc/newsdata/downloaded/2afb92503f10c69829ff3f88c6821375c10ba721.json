The capital city's metro public transport suffered nearly $400 million (\u20ac359 m) in damages.\n\nWith Pinera's popularity at an all-time low, Chileans were calling for new protests and the United Nations was sending a team to investigate allegations of human rights abuses.\n\nOn Friday, as many as a million Chileans took to the streets of Santiago in the biggest rally since violence broke out over inequality in the country.\n\nThe protests started over a hike in public transport fares, and now the military has taken on security in the capital which is under a state of emergency, with night-time curfews and soldiers patrolling the streets.\n\n\"Earlier today, I was informed of the decision by the Government of Chile not to host COP25 in view of the difficult situation that the country is undergoing,\" U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said in a statement. \"We are currently exploring alternative hosting options,\" she added.", "description": "President Sebastian Pinera said it had been a \u201cvery difficult decision\u201d to withdraw as host, as he understood the importance of the summits to Chile and the rest of the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/27/07/46/1000x563_cmsv2_9fbab2a5-b7b9-5ec4-87d2-1c3594269ed2-4270746.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
