Female workers are more likely to feel that they don\u2019t have enough savings to maintain a decent standard of living in retirement either.\n\nNumerous surveys still find women don\u2019t feel they can afford to save for a financially stable retirement, despite the improvements to savings rates thanks to the workplace pension rollout. Short-term demands on their cash take precedence when women do have unallocated disposable income, especially when it comes to family needs.\n\nDr Mary-Ann Stephenson, Director of the UK Women\u2019s Budget Group, said: \u201cThis survey highlights the stark truth that for too many women, the economy isn\u2019t working. Women have lower incomes than men, are less likely to progress in their careers and are more likely to be living in poverty at all stages of their lives.\n\n\u201cWorking class, BAME and disabled women are particularly likely to face the economic insecurity revealed in this survey.\n\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t have to be like this \u2013 we can organise the economy differently.\n\n\u201cThis report makes an important contribution to our Commission on a Gender-Equal Economy, which is working to proactively develop alternative economic policies to promote gender equality across the UK.\u201d\n\nBehavioural finance\n\nBut separate figures suggest the challenges facing women in the countdown to Halloween, and beyond, aren\u2019t just about the amount of cash coming in.\n\nNew research from KPMG has also found that men are much more cautious about their money in light of Brexit than women, with over a third of men changing their money management and only one in four women doing the same.\n\nTwelve percent of men have delayed buying a new home or making renovations, almost double the number of women who have taken the same precautions.\n\nIt\u2019s not the behaviour you would expect from a generally financially cautious demographic when faced with warnings of \u201csignificant economic risks\u201d and \u201cthe wheels coming off quite quickly\u201d in the event of an increasingly likely no-deal Brexit.\n\nEven if you prefer to dismiss these warnings as some version of \u201cproject fear\u201d, there\u2019s no doubt the growth in the wider global economy is slowing. Now would be a good time to become a little more defensive with what cash you have, whatever your gender.\n\n\u201cAlgorithm prejudice\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, if you had assumed that the drive to even up the workplace playing field was surely being successfully addressed through careful HR decision-making throughout the UK\u2019s business world, there\u2019s a new risk there too, it seems.\n\nThe RSA report also highlights the dangers of new technologies exacerbating existing gender divides in the workplace, arguing that recent cases of women suffering from in-built bias in artificial intelligence systems require a \u201crobust response\u201d from policymakers and employers.\n\nLeft unchecked, \u201calgorithmic prejudice\u201d could become one of the new giants of modern poverty, the study cautions.\n\nCampaign groups, the government and civil society should further pursue a \u2018big push\u2019 for women to join the STEM workforce, the researchers warn, calling for \u201cinformed discussion\u201d about issues around technology, gender and work \u2013 to provide for an inclusive way of tackling these issues.", "description": "It\u2019s no secret that women still earn less, have fewer savings, will struggle to make ends meet as they grow old and have less financial confidence than men.\u00a0 But they\u2019re also more worried about the effect of Brexit on their personal finances than their male counterparts, according to a major new study that shows millions of women are already living life on the financial edge.", "authors": ["Kate Hughes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/26/09/istock-950892384.jpg"}
