Surprise Offer From Hong Kong Puts Latest Deal in Doubt.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nHong Kong\u2019s exchange operator made an unexpected \u00a330 billion bid for the London Stock Exchange\n\nHong Kong\u2019s stock-exchange operator has made a \u00a329.6 billion ($36.6 billion) bid to buy the London Stock Exchange Group , just weeks after LSE agreed on a \u00a322 billion deal to merge with financial data giant Refinitiv.\n\nHong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) said the Refinitiv deal would have to be scrapped as part of its offer conditions.\n\nThe back story.\n\nLSE has a history of looking to new sources of revenue and to expand its global footprint. But it also has a long record of failing to close such deals.\n\nSince 2000, the U.K. stock exchange operator has rejected bids from Sweden\u2019s OMX, Australia\u2019s Macquarie Bank and U.S. exchange Nasdaq.\n\nAn agreed deal with Canadian stock exchange TMX fell through in 2011, while European Union regulators in 2017 blocked the LSE\u2019s \u00a321bn merger plan with German stock exchange Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2014the third time the two rivals have tried to do a deal.\n\nBack in 2016, HKEX said it was keeping a close eye on Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s bid for LSE, which ultimately collapsed.\n\nThe Hong Kong exchange operator bought the London Metal Exchange for \u00a31.4 billion in 2012.\n\nLast month, LSE agreed to buy Refinitiv for $27 billion, creating a financial data and trading powerhouse.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. HKEX said it had made a proposal to the LSE board to merge, which was an opportunity to create a \u201cglobal market infrastructure leader.\u201d\n\nThe \u00a329.6 billion deal values the LSE at 8,361 pence per share, a 22.8% premium to last night\u2019s closing price of 6,804 pence.\n\nThe Hong Kong exchange\u2019s chief executive, Charles Li, said the deal would \u201credefine global capital markets for decades to come,\u201d connecting East and West in the process.\n\nLSE said it remained committed to the acquisition of Refinitiv but would consider the \u201cunsolicited, preliminary and highly conditional\u201d proposal and make a further announcement in due course.\n\nShares in LSE soared 8.5% in early trading, but have since dropped back to 7,188 pence, a 5.6% rise that leaves the stock below the offer price.\n\nLooking ahead. The curse that keeps blocking the London Stock Exchange from completing deals has struck again.\n\nThe exchange operator\u2019s potentially game-changing Refinitiv merger seemed like a done deal until HKEX\u2019s unsolicited takeover bid on Wednesday.\n\nLSE said it remained committed to the Refinitiv acquisition. Its record suggests there may be further twists in the tale.\n\nWrite to Callum Keown at Callum.Keown@dowjones.com", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange operator has tabled a \u00a329.6 billion ($36.6 billion) bid to buy the London Stock Exchange Group.", "authors": ["Callum Keown"], "top_image": "https://asset.barrons.com/public/resources/images/ON-DD349_LSE_SOC_20190729074401.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
