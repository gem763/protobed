It\u2019s stupid, but when a gun-shaped object is pointed out you, the last thing most folks are going to do is measure the bore, especially if they don\u2019t know anything about guns.\n\nAs a result, criminals who can\u2019t get their hands on firearms will sometimes use BB guns to intimidate instead. We\u2019ve seen this happen more than once, unfortunately.\n\nHowever, few people are endangered by the use of BB guns. That\u2019s why if a police officer shoots someone pointing a BB gun at them, there\u2019s outrage. They don\u2019t get that the officer had to make a split-second decision as it only registers that a BB gun isn\u2019t likely to kill anyone.\n\nMeanwhile, in England, one police department offered this to make citizens feel safer:\n\nThese blank firing and BB handguns were seized from a house in Exhall and a man arrested. Sergeant Jack Pritchard from Bedworth Police Station said: \u201cI have no doubt that removing these items from the circulation has made our streets safer. https://t.co/fHm0omig70 pic.twitter.com/UR2GKkIzjz \u2014 Warwickshire Police (@warkspolice) September 6, 2019\n\nThis is a country that once held a global empire. Now it\u2019s terrified of the kind of thing we give our children to use after they finish their chores for the day.\n\nOh, how the mighty have fallen.\n\nSeriously, how does anyone in their right mind think this makes the streets safer? Had the sergeant said that this will make it more difficult for criminals to pretend they\u2019re armed, I\u2019d agree with them. However, the danger of such weapons is minimal. You can pop someone with a BB and it\u2019ll sting. You can even shoot someone\u2019s eye out with it, as anyone who has watched \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d knows full well, but the chances of doing much of anything serious is minimal.\n\nNow, that does make people a tad safer\u2026for values of safer. Their lives weren\u2019t at risk from these guns, not really, but I suppose they won\u2019t be potentially injured by them.\n\nThe issue with this tweet isn\u2019t even so much that officers took the guns. I mean, it kind of is, but it\u2019s also that they\u2019re bragging about taking them. They\u2019re acting like this was a major police win. It\u2019s not.\n\nIt\u2019s pathetic.\n\nThe problem is that England is no longer a nation of explorers and warriors. It\u2019s no longer the realm of King Arthur. They\u2019re not even the realm of Winston Churchill. They\u2019re a mockery of the England of old, the one we stood against during the Revolution despite having no business trying them. They were the most powerful nation in the world at that point, and we went toe-to-toe with them knowing they were so powerful.\n\nThat England is gone.\n\nNow, the government places warning labels on Thomas the Tank Engine tableware sets because there\u2019s a \u201cknife\u201d included in the set.\n\nThe kicker? There are people who think we should follow their lead. I\u2019m not talking about the British wankers who fill out social media to tell us all about how grand life is under their severe gun control restrictions, but people born in and still living in the United States. They think we should embrace this kind of stupidity for some idiotic reason.\n\nNo thank you. I\u2019d rather keep our people free and ready to defend freedom, not just for ourselves but for the rest of humanity if needed. I refuse to allow us to go down the path that takes us to police departments bragging about taking BB guns off the streets, for crying out loud. Like someone once said, I\u2019d rather deal with the problems of too much freedom than the problems of too little.\n\nGuess which side of that equation England has decided to fall on?\n\nTags:", "description": "A police spokesman was quite pleased about removing these weapons from the streets, but it illustrates just how far England has fallen.", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
