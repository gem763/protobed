Photo: Andrew Caballero-Reyolds/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s pettiness knows no limits. It was proven yet again Tuesday, when the White House said it won\u2019t renew its subscriptions to the New York Times and the Washington Post, two newspapers that have become frequent administration punching bags.\n\nTrump first pitched the idea of canceling the subscriptions in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News Monday. \u201cThe media\u2019s corrupt,\u201d Trump said, before assuring Hannity that the label doesn\u2019t apply to him: \u201cNot all media. I know some great people, including you.\u201d\n\nTrump called the New York Times a \u201cfake newspaper\u201d and added, \u201cWe don\u2019t even want it in the White House anymore. We\u2019re gonna probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They\u2019re fake.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham confirmed to Politico that the Trump administration \u201cwon\u2019t be renewing\u201d its subscriptions.\n\nWe\u2019ll see about that. Complaining about the Times and the Post is one of Trump\u2019s most beloved pastimes. The two papers are reportedly among the four delivered to his residence every morning, along with the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a fan of the New York Times or the Washington Post but he never misses a day reading them,\u201d a source told Politico this summer. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t read them that day, he\u2019ll put them in a box and read them a few days later.\u201d Giving up the Times and the Post would be giving up one of Trump\u2019s most reliable sources of anger, something he needs to survive as much as oxygen and meat loaf.\n\nIt\u2019s not like Trump can just transition to reading online, either. His written-news consumption is strictly confined to the analog realm.", "description": "Donald Trump told Sean Hannity that the White House will \u201cterminate\u201d its subscriptions to the Times and Post.", "authors": ["Adam K.
