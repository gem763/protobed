Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSaagar Enjeti questions Warren's authenticity on 'Medicare for all' All-female panel to moderate November Democratic primary debate Senate rejects Dem measure to overturn IRS rules on SALT deduction cap MORE (I-Vt.), the author of the proposal and a fellow presidential candidate, has said as much.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough money from the rich and corporations to finance that,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nBut he notes that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the middle class would have to pay more. There would be higher taxes, but no premiums and no cost sharing.\u201d\n\nWhat a middle-class family pays under Medicare for all will depend on the financing details that are eventually hammered out. But Warren has said she wouldn\u2019t sign a bill that would increase \u201ccosts\u201d for the middle class.\n\n\u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down,\u201d she said at the most recent debate earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\nWhile experts say increasing taxes on the rich is not enough to finance all of the additional federal spending needed to pay for Medicare for all, it could raise a significant amount.\n\nIncreasing taxes on the rich could involve raising the top two individual income tax rates, which are 35 percent and 37 percent; increasing the corporate income tax rate, which is currently 21 percent; and taxing capital gains.\n\nRobert Pollin, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who supports Medicare for all and has worked with Sanders and Warren, says much of the plan can be funded by redirecting money the government is already spending on health care programs like Medicaid and Medicare. Medicare for all, which he estimates to cost about $2.9 trillion a year, would further save money, he argues, by cutting out much of the administrative costs associated with the private insurance industry.\n\nHe also recommends imposing a net worth tax of 0.38 percent on anyone making more than $1 million a year to generate $200 billion annually.\n\nPollin also supports a 3.75 percent national sales tax that excludes items deemed essential like housing and food.\n\nSince businesses would no longer provide health insurance to their employees under Medicare for all, he also recommends an 8 percent tax on all business income, with exceptions for small operations, that would raise $600 billion annually.\n\nSanders has similarly suggested a 7.5-percent payroll taxes on businesses, also with exemptions for small businesses, estimating it would generate $3.9 trillion over ten years.\n\nSanders has also suggested a 4-percent income-based \u201cpremium\u201d paid by households, that wouldn\u2019t be paid by low-income families.\n\nAdditionally, those making more than $250,000 a year would pay an increased tax rate, topping 52 percent for households making more than $10 million a year.\n\nHis recommended changes to income tax rates would raise $1.8 trillion over ten years, he estimates.\n\nSome experts say Medicare for all could be funded by looking at other areas of the federal budget.\n\n\u201cWe are vastly overspending on the Pentagon,\u201d said Lindsay Koshgarian, who directs the National Priorities Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, and wrote about the issue for a recent op-ed in The New York Times. She found $300 billion in annual savings that could be invested in Medicare for all.", "description": "It\u2019s the multitrillion dollar question everyone is trying to answer, including Sen.
