That\u2019s not going to happen with us. We learned.\u2019\n\nDisparaging the press as Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cunwitting accomplice.\u201d Shaming journalists for spending too much time on Twitter. Pointedly telling a reporter to \u201cask the right question.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden\u2018s presidential campaign is waging a media offensive to control the Ukraine narrative, a display of targeted force designed to head off a repeat of what the campaign refers to as \u201cHillary 2.0.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSince Friday alone, Biden\u2019s team has adopted a new in-your-face approach, including repeatedly singling out journalists behind unfavorable coverage, tweeting out taunts that accuse reporters of carrying Trump\u2019s water and rolling out a series of fact-checking memos.\n\nIt\u2019s all designed to focus coverage squarely on allegations that Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate the Biden family \u2014 and away from the president\u2019s attempts to highlight Biden\u2019s son Hunter\u2019s business activities in Ukraine. Biden himself has taken on a more confrontational tone in addressing the subject, including in a fiery, finger-pointing exchange with a Fox News reporter caught on camera.\n\nKate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s communications director, tweeted the clip and, repeating her boss\u2019 demand in the exchange, wrote: \u201cASK. THE. RIGHT. QUESTION.\u201d\n\nBedingfield acknowledged Monday that the fierce pushback was in part aimed at preventing a reprisal of the 2016 presidential campaign, where questions over Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails cannibalized her campaign.\n\n\u201cWe are going to call out Trump\u2019s sleazy, disingenuous playbook for what it is,\u201d Bedingfield said. \u201cHe makes the press an unwitting accomplice in spreading his lies when they don\u2019t keep their focus on egregious abuses of power. The smears he\u2019s trying to spread have been universally debunked and are only true in some MAGA-land alternate universe.\u201d\n\nAnother Biden adviser was more pointed: \u201cYou saw what happened to Hillary in 2016 with all of the ridiculous coverage about her emails. That\u2019s not going to happen with us. We learned.\u201d\n\nAmong the learned lessons: Remain on the attack against all sides. The campaign has demanded that Trump release a transcript of his calls with the Ukrainian president and accused him of the \u201cgreatest presidential malfeasance since Watergate.\u201d They\u2019ve also specifically warned that reporters were misleading their audiences unless they \u201cdemonstrably state at the outset that there is no factual basis for Trump\u2019s claims.\u201d\n\nThe campaign also produced a video newsreel that pointedly criticized recent coverage and asked whether reporters would \u201cfall for it again,\u201d in a reference to 2016.\n\nFar from a defensive crouch, the campaign is attempting to capitalize on the moment by rallying the party around what they characterize as a standard Trump dirty trick. One aspect of their approach is raising money off the controversy. Since news of Trump\u2019s call broke on Friday, the campaign has sent out half a dozen fundraising emails pointing to Trump\u2019s attempts to \u201csmear\u201d the former vice president. And the campaign has tripled its per day average in online fundraising, according to a Biden aide.\n\nAccording to interviews with five Biden advisers, the message is simple and straightforward: Trump asked a foreign government to meddle in the 2016 election, and he\u2019s doing it again.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

It demonstrated Biden\u2019s strength,\u201d LaBolt said. \u201cThe campaign has not had a lot of viral clips. And this is one that will be seen by primary voters. You couldn\u2019t script it better.\u201d\n\nThe confrontational tone marks a tactical shift for the Biden campaign, which doesn\u2019t exactly have warm relations with the press but isn\u2019t recognized as an especially combative operation.\n\nIn one instance, the Biden campaign in a memo swiped at a columnist for The Hill by name, lumping his stories together with Sputnik News, a Kremlin-supported news agency. But the top target of Biden campaign criticism was the New York Times\u2019 Ken Vogel, who in May, with Iuliia Mendel, reported how Trump and his allies were promoting \u201cconflict of interest questions\u201d against Biden.\n\nMendel became the spokesperson for new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, weeks after the controversial May story was published.\n\nJennifer Palmieri, who served as communications director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, said the only way to beat Trump is to forcefully call out the press for repeating unsubstantiated allegations.\n\n\u201cThe reality is when you\u2019re running against Donald Trump it\u2019s dangerous to not engage when you\u2019re attacked in this way,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cThis is how [Trump] wins. He gets enough people to believe a lie and tries to wear down the opposition by weaving the lie into the coverage.\n\n\u201cYou have to fight back. Just because the press doesn\u2019t have a political axe to grind doesn\u2019t mean they get everything right or portray them fairly,\u201d she said.\n\nJoin our reporters for live coverage of the U.N.

General Assembly ADD TO GOOGLE CALENDAR\n\nThere\u2019s no better example of that than the campaign\u2019s aggressive approach against Vogel, who has become the public face for the Times\u2019s coverage. Vogel said Friday on MSNBC that the Ukraine story is \u201ca significant liability\u201d for Biden, remarks that some criticized as echoing the Times\u2019s treatment of Clinton. Trump then approvingly tweeted a video featuring Vogel\u2019s comments early Saturday morning. [Vogel covered the 2016 election for POLITICO.]\n\nIn response, in a campaign-produced video with the subhead, \u201cTrump\u2019s sleazy playbook,\u201d the commentator declares \u201cWhat Ken Vogel said is false,\u201d and also criticizes POLITICO\u2019s coverage.\n\nOther Biden and former Clinton staffers joined the pile-on. One Biden staffer commented \u201cbrutal\u201d before quoting a New York Magazine piece critical of Vogel. And the campaign\u2019s fact-checking memos were riddled with citations aimed at debunking his coverage.\n\nLongtime Clinton aide Philippe Reines referenced Vogel when tweeting that Clinton was \u201cthe target in 2016\u201d while Biden \u201cis the 2019 target.\"\n\n\u201cIt just feels like a replay,\u201d Reines said in an interview. \u201cEveryone can make fun of crazy Rudy [Giuliani, the president\u2019s lawyer] all they want, but it was mission accomplished. It\u2019s the false equivalence. You can\u2019t say the words \u2018Trump\u2019 and \u2018Ukraine\u2019 without seeing \u2018Biden\u2019 and \u2018Ukraine.\u2019 The only reason the word \u2018Biden\u2019 should appear is to say [Trump] was soliciting dirt on Biden.\u201d\n\nVogel did not respond to requests for comment and the Times did not make any editor available to discuss the handling of the Biden-Ukraine story.\n\n\u201cOur only approach to covering all aspects of the Ukraine story is that we'll do it aggressively,\u201d a Times spokesperson told POLITICO.\n\n", "description": "\"You saw what happened to Hillary in 2016 with all of the ridiculous coverage about her emails.
