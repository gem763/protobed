They have already warned us that this is what they\u2019ve planned on doing, so we have been warned. It seems to me that it\u2019s OK to have sanctuary cities, but it\u2019s not OK to have a sanctuary county, so that\u2019s why I put this on here to see if we want to step out there and do that.\n\nOn October 9, 2019, Breitbart News reported Hood County, Texas, declared itself a Second Amendment Sanctuary.\n\nWFAA quoted Hood County Sheriff Roger Deeds saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to stand by as a sheriff for this county and they are not going to stand by as the commissioners\u2019 court of this county and let Second Amendment rights be violated.\u201d\n\nDeeds added, \u201cThis is all about the right to keep and bear arms.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
