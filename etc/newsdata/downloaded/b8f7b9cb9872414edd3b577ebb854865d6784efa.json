But Colin Grant reminds us that \u2018the popular image . . . has also reduced the story \u2014 not least because it excludes over 200 women who were also passengers.\u2019\n\nSignificantly, he points out that it can get in the way of \u2018the bigger picture of the impact of mass migration\u2019, as \u2018some 300,000 adventurers made their way to Britain\u2019 from all the West Indian islands over the next 15 years. Grant was spurred to record people \u2018before their stories disappeared\u2019.\n\nHis interviews reveal natural courage and style enough to face down even the vile racism encountered on the streets of Notting Hill in the 1950s and afterwards.\n\nSoon after he began recording, \u2018the British government gave a new twist to the story ensuring that the name \u201cWindrush\u201d will now also forever be associated with scandal.\u2019\n\nCoincidentally, at the same time, prize-winning Guardian journalist Amelia Gentleman was revealing the scandal of how the government\u2019s \u2018hostile environment\u2019 policy for illegal immigrants led to thousands of Windrush descendants being wrongly classified as living here illegally.\n\nMany lost their jobs, some were deported, all were hurt and enraged by their appalling treatment at \u2018the mother country\u2019. One quotation encapsulates a bewilderment that can never be assuaged: \u2018How do you pack for a one-way journey to a country you left when you were 11 and have not visited for 50 years?\u2019\n\nWhose fault was it? Gentleman paints a searing picture of a Home Office not fit for purpose and politicians who exist within a self-centred Westminster bubble of party politics. It\u2019s impossible to read her account of the step-by-step betrayal without feeling ashamed that it was done in your name.\n\nPictured left: HOMECOMING by Colin Grant (Cape \u00a318.99, 320 pp) Pictured right: THE WINDRUSH BETRAYAL by Amelia Gentleman (Guardian Faber \u00a318.99, 336 pp)\n\nBut despite real admiration for this book, she and I part company on some of the broad strokes of her postscript. For example, she seems determined to see the scandal as symptomatic of widespread endemic racism rather than shocking bureaucratic bungling and negligence.\n\nBut, she asserts, it suits the government to present what took place as \u2018a small predicament affecting a niche-group of retirement-age Caribbean people who had no papers.\u2019\n\nGentleman quotes a Guardian colleague: \u2018It has yet to fully sink in that what was wrong for the Windrush generation is wrong for all immigrants\u2019. Is it? All? Should peoples be lumped together in this way?\n\nThere were/are very real public concerns about the true extent of immigration to these shores \u2014 the latest projections suggest the population will hit 70 million by 2031 \u2014 and its effect on infrastructure.\n\nThese cannot be dismissed as \u2018xenophobic, anti-immigrant conviction\u2019 and \u2018a gradual withering of empathy.\u2019 Yes, the Home Office was wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\nBut the Windrush generation shouldn\u2019t be shoehorned into a wider outrage that arguably chips away at their very special status.", "description": "Colin Grant shares accounts of the immigrants who came from the West Indies in search of a better life in Britain.
