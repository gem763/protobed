Here\u2019s what you need to do to qualify.", "language": "en", "text": "We asked Raymond Eshaghian, founder and president of Greenbox Loans in Los Angeles, to discuss an alternative mortgage option for self-employed borrowers.\n\nWhat you need to know before you start looking to buy a home\n\n\u201cSome lenders have stepped up with mortgage options for the self-employed,\u201d Eshaghian said in an email. \u201cMy company offers bank statement loans that are specifically for self-employed borrowers. Unfortunately, there are many self-employed workers that are currently renting and they\u2019re not aware that these loan programs exist, so they don\u2019t think they can buy a home.\u201d\n\nEshaghian said that self-employed borrowers using bank statements need to provide 12 to 24 months of bank statements and/or a profit and loss statement to show that they have the income to afford the mortgage payments on the home they want to purchase. To qualify, those borrowers need to have been self-employed for a minimum of two years, even on the 12-month bank statement program.\n\n\u201cWe do not look at tax returns at all for our bank statement loan programs,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn fact, if a loan comes in with tax returns, we have to use the income on the tax returns and can no longer provide a bank statement loan. The income often reported by self-employed people on their tax returns is less than their true earnings because they are allowed to take advantage of tax deductions for the self-employed, which reduces their taxable income. That is why they are usually better off with a bank statement loan.\u201d\n\nSelf-employed borrowers with a FICO credit score as low as 580 may qualify for a loan with a 20 percent down payment if they can provide 24 months of bank statements proving they can afford the loan payments with Greenbox Loans. Borrowers with a FICO score of 720 or above may qualify for a mortgage with a 10 percent down payment and a typically lower interest rate.\n\nEshaghian has several recommendations for self-employed home buyers:\n\n\u201cThey need to make sure they do not have an excessive number of \u2018non-sufficient funds\u2019 or overdrafts on their bank statements,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you have too many of either, it shows a lack of financial management and lenders have limited tolerance for that. It undercuts the whole concept of using bank statements to determine income. I also advise people to get organized and make sure they have all their documents, including bank statements, in order.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: If you\u2019re self-employed, consult a lender to discuss your specific circumstances and find out what type of loan options are available.", "description": "TOWN SQUARE | Borrowers in the gig economy have more options in the marketplace, including bank statement loans.", "authors": ["Michele Lerner"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CJEWQ7GEFYI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
