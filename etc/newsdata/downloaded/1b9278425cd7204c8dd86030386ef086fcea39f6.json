The Press Association reported that London's UN ambassador Karen Pierce, at least, laughed along.\n\nOn AI, Mr Johnson said: \"Above all, we need to agree a common set of global principles to shape the norms and standards that will guide the development of emerging technology.\"\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
