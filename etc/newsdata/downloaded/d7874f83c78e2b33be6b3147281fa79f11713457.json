No,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cWe think we\u2019re going to win. We think it\u2019s going to be a dogfight\u2026 but we think there are several candidates in this field, there\u2019s probably three or four, that are going to go awhile.\u201d\n\nThe advisers have also said that they\u2019ve laid the groundwork in early voting states, but are \u201cnow ramping up for Super Tuesday and beyond.\u201d\n\nBIDEN CAMPAIGN DOWNPLAYS EXPECTATIONS IN BOTH IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n\u201cWe feel we are going to be in a very dominant spot,\u201d after the first four early states, another adviser said.\n\nAppearing on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201d Baier told host Julie Banderas, \u201cIf you\u2019re the frontrunner, you\u2019re expected to win every place. So, when you start saying in September that it\u2019s not necessary for you to win Iowa -- you don\u2019t have to win it -- that\u2019s not exactly the best message out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cProblem is: by the time you get there, it could be too late,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThere are candidates who obviously have skipped Iowa and gone on to win and become president. However, usually in recent history, it is a pivotal state,\u201d Baier added.\n\nTRUMP TRAILING BIDEN IN CRUCIAL 2020 BATTLEGROUND STATE OF WISCONSIN: POLL\n\nIn addition, Biden\u2019s campaign advisers underscored his lead in the polls and argued he holds the \u201cbroadest reach\u201d of the competitors.\n\nBaier, however, said he believes that Biden has to play well in Iowa to be at the top.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is inevitability\u2026the ability to beat Donald Trump, the ability to be the best candidate\u2026If suddenly the Democratic caucus, the Democratic primary voters decide, \u2018You know what, he\u2019s not the best and we think there\u2019s somebody better,\u2019 that inevitability thing starts running out pretty quickly,\" Baier said.\n\nBiden\u2019s status as the frontrunner to be nominated has also taken several blows over the past few weeks after a series of public misstatements and gaffes.\n\nKARL ROVE: JOE BIDEN THE SUBJECT OF 'TENSION' INSIDE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY\n\nIn response, campaign advisers labeled accusations of the 76-year-old Biden being out of step with the party \u201ccomplete nonsense.\u201d\n\nOn \"America's Newsroom,\" Baier commented: \u201cIn performing and when he talks about stories where he forgets the states, where he forgets whether he was vice president or senator at the time of some trip overseas, or talking to kids -- a school shooting\u2026those are big things. Those are not small \u2018remembrances.\u2019\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s angst. There\u2019s anxiousness in the Democratic circles about Joe Biden and his frontrunner status. It is a weak frontrunner status,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cAnd, if you\u2019re going to make your campaign\u2026going against President Trump for his lack of truth-telling as Democrats do pretty much every day, you\u2019re going to be in a weaker position with someone who has his own problems telling stories,\u201d Baier concluded.", "description": "Democratic circles are anxious about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s status as the 2020 frontrunner, \u201cSpecial Report\u201d host Bret Baier said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S", "America'S Newsroom."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/04/694940094001_6083422901001_6083424173001-vs.jpg"}
