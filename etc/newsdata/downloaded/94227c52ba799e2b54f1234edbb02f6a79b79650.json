It's unclear what prompted the citizen to report the car's location.\n\nPolice said that the car had sustained damage between the time that it was last seen in Auburn, Alabama, and when it was found about 50 miles away in Montgomery.\n\nPictures released by authorities show damage to the right front side of the car, as well as what appears to be scrape marks along the front passenger side door.

Blanchard apparently told her roommate that she was out with a 'young man' that she had just met.\n\nBlanchard did not reveal how she met him or where she met him.\n\nThat was said to be the last time that Blanchard was heard from before she disappeared.\n\nHaley-Harris said that Blanchard's debit card was used that night at 11.20pm in Auburn and that her cell phone 'went dark' after 11.57pm.\n\nBlanchard's parents, including her mother, Angela Haley-Harris (in grey), and Harris (right)\n\nPrior to her disappearance, Blanchard (in orange) had driven her brother to a funeral in North Alabama, then stopped at her parents' home to see Harris (pictured) before going to Auburn\n\nHarris (pictured in May) and Blanchard's relatives have been out searching for the missing girl\n\nPolice were said to have figured out where Blanchard's phone had last pinged off a cell tower and been searching the area.\n\nAlthough police said that there were no signs of foul play involved with Blanchard's going missing, Haley-Harris said that it was unlike her daughter not to get in contact with her parents or return home.\n\nShe did not show up for work Thursday, either.\n\nBlanchard is described as a light-complexioned black female, who is 5 feet 6-inches tall and weighs bout 125 pounds, with brown eyes and brown hair.
