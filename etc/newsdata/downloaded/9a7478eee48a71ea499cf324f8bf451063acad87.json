Did he stop to think that the draft German no-deal contingency legislation on the status of some 107,000 British citizens in Germany is currently being debated in the Bundestag? And did he think about the consequences of using the term \u2018deportation\u2019 in a German historic context?\n\n\u201cIt appears that ministers are either unaware or indifferent as to the consequences of their pronouncements on our position in the countries where we live and are either unaware or heedless of the principle of reciprocity.\u201d\n\nThe 1.3 million British citizens living in EU countries \u2013 the vast majority working age \u2013 are set to have their lives turned upside down by a no-deal Brexit, and under the terms negotiated by the government would suffer a loss of rights even if a last-minute deal can be secured.\n\nLiberal Democrat MEP Lucy Nethsingha, chair of the European Parliament\u2019s Legal Affairs Committee, told The Independent: \u201cThe UK government has its head in the sand when it comes to the needs of British nationals elsewhere in the EU.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

UK nationals, who moved abroad believing their right to do so would be lifelong, could now face the prospect of retaliatory deportations. The millionaire backers of Brexit will always be free to move where they like, freedom of movement extended these rights to everyone.\u201d\n\nSignatories to the letter include the leadership of local support groups like British in Germany, British in France and British In Italy, as well as umbrella groups like Expats Citizen Rights in EU and British In Europe, which have supporters across the 27 member states.\n\nThey say government policy of \u201cundermining the status our EU 27 friends in the UK undermines our status\u201d and that their treatment is \u201ca far cry from the promises that were made during the Referendum campaign\u201d.\n\nAddressing the prime minister directly, the letter states: \u201cVote Leave \u2013 the group you spearheaded \u2013 pledged that nothing would change for the five million people whose lives would be directly affected by Brexit.\n\n\u201cIn fact, you accused those of us raising these entirely prescient concerns of \u2018scaremongering\u2019. And even if a deal is reached by the end of October, we will lose key rights anyway, such as free movement, cross border working and recognition of qualifications.\n\n\u201cIt gives us no pleasure whatsoever to have been proved right, and we call yet again upon the government to make good upon its duty to protect the interests of its citizens who reside in the EU 27.\u201d\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cProtecting the rights of both UK nationals in the EU and EU citizens in the UK is a top priority for this government.\n\n\u201cWe have been very clear that where individuals have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme, they\u2019ll be given a further opportunity to apply.\n\n\u201cWe have made an unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens currently in the UK and we urge other EU member states to do the same for UK nationals living in their countries and give them the certainty they need by matching our generous offer.\u201d\n\nMr Lewis, the minister who recently warned EU citizens living in the UK could be deported if they missed a key deadline, has said his words were \u201csomewhat taken out of context\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s no reason this should ever happen\u201d.\n\nMs Patel announced on 19 August that she wanted to end free movement as soon as the UK left the EU, but U-turned on 1 September less than two weeks later after it emerged the policy would likely face serious practical difficulties.\n\nThe full letter and signatories are below:", "description": "Botched announcements by Boris Johnson\u2019s government are putting over a million British citizens living on the continent at the risk of \u201cretaliatory deportations\u201d and other consequences after Brexit, the prime minister has been warned.", "authors": ["Jon Stone"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/06/boris-johnson-downing-street-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
