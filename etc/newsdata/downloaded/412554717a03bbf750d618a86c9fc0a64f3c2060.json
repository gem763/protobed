Encryption became a national political issue following the 2015 San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack when investigators could not unlock the shooter\u2019s iPhone.\n\n\u201cSecurity enhancements to the virtual world should not make us more vulnerable in the physical world,\u201d the four officials wrote in their letter, which precedes a Justice Department event on Friday that will focus on how online encryption affects investigations into child exploitation cases.\n\n\u201cWe must find a way to balance the need to secure data with public safety and the need for law enforcement to access the information they need to safeguard the public, investigate crimes, and prevent future criminal activity,\u201d they said.\n\nMorning Cybersecurity A daily briefing on politics and cybersecurity \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Messages and calls are some of the most sensitive private conversations people have, and in a world of increasing cyber security threats and heavy-handed government intervention in many countries, people want us to take the extra step to secure their most private data.\u201d\n\nYet officials say that approach will even harm work Facebook itself has done to report criminal activity on the platform. In their letter, the officials note Facebook made 16.8 million reports to the U.S. National Center for Missing & Exploited Children concerning images of child abuse or suspicious attempts by users \u201cto meet children online and groom or entice them into sharing indecent imagery or meeting in real life.\u201d If it deploys encryption throughout its services, they say, this kind of monitoring will no longer be possible.\n\nIn response to the letter, Facebook said it is working with child advocacy groups, as well as tech experts and government officials, before adding increased security and privacy measures to its apps.\n\n\u201cEnd-to-end encryption already protects the messages of over a billion people every day,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told POLITICO in a statement. \u201cIt is increasingly used across the communications industry and in many other important sectors of the economy. We strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere.\u201d\n\nPrivacy advocates and technologists have long argued that tech companies and social media platforms can\u2019t create special access for law enforcement while still protecting consumers\u2019 security online.\n\n\"If we could design a technology to tell good guys from bad guys, we could exclude bad guys from these systems,\u201d said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. \u201cBut we can't. We don't try to design sidewalks that crumble underneath the feet of bad guys.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he said, the government\u2019s approach of using violence against children as the reason to argue against encryption amounts to fear-mongering. \"Frankly I think they've seen child sexual exploitation and sex trafficking as a wedge issue,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite officials\u2019 complaints about more widespread encryption on Facebook\u2019s messaging apps, people are increasingly gravitating toward services that offer encryption.\n\n\"The trend in private messaging is towards end-to-end encryption,\u201d said Thomas Rid, a cybersecurity expert and professor at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Advanced International Studies. \u201cBy and large, that is a positive and good trend.\"\n\nBut he recognizes this trend means that law enforcement may be blocked from getting access they need for investigations. There\u2019s a downside \"because you lose visibility into potentially criminal behavior, and this is an example of it. It also means that people who are in more vulnerable situations are protected from their governments. You have to balance out the costs.\"\n\nAlong with the letter to Facebook, officials also plan to announce an agreement that will allow British law enforcement to demand major American tech companies hand over electronic data relating to terrorism, child exploitation and other serious criminal offenses.\n\nThe new agreement \u201cwill enhance the ability of the United States and the United Kingdom to fight serious crime \u2014 including terrorism, transnational organized crime, and child exploitation \u2014 by allowing more efficient and effective access to data needed for quick-moving investigations,\u201d Barr said in a statement reviewed by POLITICO also set to be released on Thursday evening in the U.S.\n\n\u201cOnly by addressing the problem of timely access to electronic evidence of crime committed in one country that is stored in another, can we hope to keep pace with twenty-first century threats,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a statement obtained by POLITICO, Patel said the data agreement \u201cwill dramatically speed up investigations, allowing our law enforcement agencies to protect the public.\u201d\n\nPrior to approving the new agreement, law enforcement data request for communications data had to be submitted and approved by central governments via mutual legal assistance \u2014 a process that could take anywhere from six months to two years. The agreement will shrink that amount of time to weeks, possibly days.\n\nSteven Overly contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/eb/6a/71a595b0452a84b971907b904756/191003-zuckerberg-ap-773.jpg"}
