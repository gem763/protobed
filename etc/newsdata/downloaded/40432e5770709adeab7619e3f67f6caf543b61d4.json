For many of us, that means pulling on a pair of tried-and-true Chelsea boots, a staple shoe in the wardrobes of countless sartorially inclined people. It\u2019s easy to see why they\u2019re so popular: They\u2019re streamlined, easy to slip on and off, and have been classic since mods made them cool in 1960s Britain. To find the best Chelsea boots out there, we asked stylists, fashion bloggers, and all-around stylish women for their favorites, from sleek classic leather ones to chunky platforms and everything in between. Below, 29 foliage-stomping pairs, as recommended by our panel of cool people.\n\nThe best classic Chelsea boots\n\nDr. Martens Chelsea Boot This chunky take on the Chelsea was called out as a favorite by two of our panelists, including London journalist and podcaster Pandora Sykes, who says she lives \u201cin a pair of chunky-soled, patent oxblood short Chelsea boots. Next on my list are a white pair.\u201d Freddie Harrel, the blogger turned founder of beauty company RadSwan, also loves the Dr. Martens Chelsea for its thick sole and signature yellow line. \u201cThis pair adds an extra badass edge to any outfit,\u201d she says. $145 at Zappos Buy\n\nDr. Martens Flora Smooth Chelsea Boot For something a little sleeker, consider the Flora, which features polished leather and a monochromatic look. It\u2019s one of Coveteur senior beauty editor Hannah Baxter\u2019s favorite boots (she owns multiple Docs), and because the brand is British, she feels like they\u2019re the \u201creal deal\u201d Chelsea boots. $140 at Dr. Martens Buy\n\nNisolo Chelsea Boot Two of our stylish women, Teat and Cosset\u2019s Peggy Economou, and Kate McLeod, a co-founder of her eponymous brand that makes all-natural lotion \u201cstones,\u201d recommend these everyday boots from sustainable shoe company Nisolo. Economou loves that they\u2019re \u201cunderstated and elegant,\u201d and McLeod says they\u2019re \u201cquickly becoming my new shoe staple,\u201d because \u201cthey can be dressed up or down, slide right on, and fit snugly.\u201d Both women add that they appreciate Nisolo\u2019s commitment to comfort, quality, ethical factories, and fair trade. \u201cNisolo partners with Ecosphere to offset carbon emissions and ensures that their artisans have proper health care and are earning fair wages,\u201d explains McLeod. $228 at Nisolo Buy\n\nThe Ainsley Chelsea Boot Eva Lee, content operations manager at Refinery29, loves these flat Chelsea boots for their versatility. \u201cYou can wear them with anything: cropped jeans, trousers, or with tights under a skirt,\u201d she says. She cites the shape of the toe and the shaft height as making them \u201cthe perfect middle ground between casual but still feminine.\u201d $198 at Madewell Buy\n\nEverlane Modern Chelsea Boot Everlane\u2019s Chelsea boot is classic all the way, too, with a leather heel tab, squared elastic panels for easy on-and-off, and a toe that\u2019s pointed just so. It comes recommended by publicist Sonya Li Casino, who loves the tapered toe and simple silhouette. $198 at Everlane Buy\n\nFrye Melissa Chelsea Celebrity stylist Tara Swennen, who is best known for dressing Kristen Stewart, recommends Frye\u2019s Melissa boot because it looks good and, importantly, holds up. \u201cThis is a staple boot that\u2019s not only durable but also super-sleek,\u201d she explains. $298 at Zappos Buy\n\nBlundstone Women\u2019s Dress Boots \u201cI love Blundstone boots because they\u2019re utilitarian and can withstand heavy city walking while still looking feminine,\u201d says Nadine Abramcyk, co-founder of salon Tenoverten. She prefers this more streamlined style over the Australian brand\u2019s popular work boot. $190 at Zappos Buy\n\nDaryl K Chelsea Girl Boot Jane Aldridge of the blog Sea of Shoes recommends these Chelsea boots by Daryl K. \u201cI always wear them a lot this time of year,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re about as classic as it gets, and I always get compliments on them when I wear them.\u201d Aldridge adds that they make \u201cgreat travel boots, too.\u201d $450 at Daryl K Buy\n\nTod\u2019s T Logo Chelsea Boot \u201cTod\u2019s Leather Chelsea boot is the everything boot,\u201d says Maisonette co-founder Sylvana Ward-Durrett. She says it works equally well with jeans or with tights and a dress. We like the low heel on this guy and the elastic side panel that\u2019s shaped like a T. $745 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nPrada Glossed-Leather Chelsea Boots Here\u2019s a daintier glossy boot with a pointed toe, recommended by Maisonette\u2019s other co-founder, Luisana Mendoza de Roccia. She calls the classic style \u201cboth elegant and functional.\u201d And the tiny Prada logo embossed in white is a just-subtle-enough way to flex your taste. $890 at Net-a-Porter Buy\n\nSaint Laurent Wyatt Leather Chelsea Boots A few of our cool women say the best Chelsea boots aren\u2019t only found in the women\u2019s shoe section. Brooklyn-based fashion blogger and stylist Allison Graham, who shows off her European menswear-inspired style on her blog She Does Him, told us she likes these men\u2019s Chelsea boots by Saint Laurent in a tan suede. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a huge fan of Saint Laurent\u2019s Chelsea boots, as I\u2019m very big on quality and colors.\u201d Baxter agrees, saying that although the Wyatt boots are for men, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t snag your size and look just as cool as the boys.\u201d She calls them \u201cthe quintessential rock-and-roll Chelsea boot,\u201d and we don\u2019t disagree. $945 at Barneys New York Buy\n\nBest Chelsea boots with a lift\n\nDr. Martens Black 2976 Quad Platform Chelsea Boots Platform Chelsea boots seem to be the trend to try this fall, and these from Dr. Martens \u2014 arguably the favorite brand among our experts for always cool, never-go-wrong Chelseas \u2014 are one of your best bets this season. Man Repeller\u2019s market and affiliate strategist Elizabeth Tamkin already owns a pair of patent leather Docs, but told us she\u2019s hoping to upgrade to this elevated pair for the many wet days ahead. $180 at SSENSE Buy\n\nFor something with a little more lift than the Daryl K boots, Aldridge recommends Eytys\u2019 chunkier Nikita boots. \u201cI love any boots with monstrous proportions, so these clunky Chelsea boots caught my eye immediately.\u201d While her favorite pair in crocodile-effect leather is sold out, the Nikitas are still available in black leather. Tamkin also recommends a clunky pair from Eytys, the slightly more streamlined Ortega boot, which also provides a pretty hefty lift, courtesy of a two-inch heel.\n\nPhoto: 19-09-03 Accessories AM1 B8 john Ash Muse Chelsea Boots High-gloss leather and a thick lug sole give these a tough, combat-boot-like look. Stylist Lindsey Shores say they\u2019re attention-grabbing, comfortable, and great for winter, thanks to their substantial rubber sole. $268 at Shopbop Buy\n\nBest brogue-style Chelsea boots\n\nRussell and Bromley Cadogan Brogue Chelsea Boot For a twist on the traditionally unadorned Chelsea boots, London-based fashion stylist and blogger Alex Stedman suggests these British-made, brogue-style Chelsea boots that she\u2019s had \u201cfor years\u201d and calls her \u201call-time favorites.\u201d She adds that \u201cthey\u2019re such a classic pair, and they\u2019ll definitely come into their own again\u201d now that fall has returned. $303 at Russell & Bromley Buy\n\nGrenson Jessie Boot Tamkin also told us she looks to the boys for her Chelsea boots. \u201cI love men\u2019s footwear,\u201d she says. \u201cSomething about the toe, the details, and the width is always more pleasing to me.\u201d Her favorite is a brogue-style pair from British heritage brand Grenson, which started with men\u2019s boots and has since released this version for women. Tamkin calls them \u201cthe most perfect brogue Chelsea boot\u201d and imagines that they would look smart worn \u201cwith a wool suit or perhaps a perfect plaid trouser.\u201d $370 at Grenson Buy\n\nBurberry Brogue Chelsea Boots Freelance fashion writer Alyssa Coscarelli also has her eye on a brogue style \u2014 in particular, this elevated pair from Burberry. She says the \u201cbrogue-boot hybrid\u201d is everything she wants in a shoe for the fall: \u201cFunky, platformed, goes with everything.\u201d $890 at Farfetch Buy\n\nBest statement Chelsea boots\n\nPhoto: 19-06-07 Accessories AM1 B8 jentricolello W Freda Salvador Joan Chelsea Booties To make even more of an impression, try this snake-embossed leather pair in a fiery red from Freda Salvador, also recommended by Casino.

When choosing a Chelsea boot, she looks for a pair that has a narrow toe and an \u201cedgy heel.\u201d Bychkov-Sulot adds that she loves the faux-pearl trim on these, which give them a feminine touch. $650 at Net-a-Porter Buy\n\nRachel Comey Cove Boot in New Leopard Calf Hair Leather These leopard-print boots from Rachel Comey are the go-to Chelseas of Meredith Winfrey, the co-founder of PR firm Project MM. She says that the print makes them fun and playful but not too loud, \u201cso they go with everything.\u201d Winfrey adds that the shape of the toe and the calf-hair leather mean they\u2019re \u201cstill chic.\u201d $495 at Rachel Comey Buy\n\nAlexander Wang Hailey Boot Another chunky-heeled take on the Chelsea, this Alexander Wang style also boasts some metal hardware in the form of a halo toe guard, which Baxter says gives it \u201ca little more flair than the average Chelsea style.\u201d She also adds that although they might not look it, \u201cThese boots are ridiculously comfortable. I adore them.\u201d $795 at Alexander Wang Buy\n\nAmiri Bandana-Strap Suede Jodhpur Boots Graham also recommends these Western-inspired boots by Amiri, a line she loves: \u201cI love how different and unique its Chelsea boots are,\u201d she says, noting that \u201cquality truly matters\u201d when she\u2019s looking for a good boot. These are available in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes. $1,390 at Barneys New York Buy\n\nBest old Celine\u2013style Chelsea boots\n\nLabucq Suba Chelsea Black Calf According to Tamkin, past season Celine Chelsea boots are the platonic ideal of the style. But if you can\u2019t find any on TheRealReal, she says these from Labucq will do. She loves the chunky tread sole of this particular pair, and recommends offsetting the bulk with \u201ca girly tea-length dress.\u201d $395 at Labucq Buy\n\nChurch\u2019s Chunky Heel Chelsea Boots Art director Madelynn Furlong also thinks the very best Chelsea boots are old Celine. The closest dupe she\u2019s found for that elusive pair\u2019s chunky heel and smooth leather is this style from British heritage brand Church\u2019s. $561 at Farfetch Buy\n\nBest white Chelsea boots\n\nRag & Bone Shawn Chelsea For those undeterred by treating the occasional scuff, white Chelsea boots are another way to stand out among a sea of darker-leather styles. Tamkin loves this pair from Rag & Bone, a brand she says \u201chas forever been New York City women\u2019s go-to Chelsea boots.\u201d She loves these because \u201cthe style is very different from what I associate with Rag & Bone boots, and I adore the elegant stitching on these combat Chelsea boots.\u201d $550 at Shopbop Buy\n\nProenza Schouler Suede Chelsea Boots A little more subdued, this pair in a luxurious creamy suede has a contrasting chunky sole that Tamkin thinks would go quite nicely with \u201cwhite stirrups and a giant men\u2019s fisherman sweater.\u201d $795 at Net-a-Porter Buy\n\nManolo Blahnik Dildi Leather Booties Swennen recommends this white pair with a pointed toe and a spiky stiletto, which she says screams mod.
