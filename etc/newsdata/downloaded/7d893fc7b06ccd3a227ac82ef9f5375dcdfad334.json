An email was sent and more than a year\u2019s worth of research was presented to the world. And they waited.\n\nAt 12.01 Dr Stewart\u2019s phone rang. It hasn\u2019t stopped since. He was exhausted when we met on Thursday at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital to spend three hours dissecting the aftermath of one of the most significant turning points in the management of all competitive contact sports.\n\nThe research, though nuanced in many areas, was actually easily understood and stark. At Glasgow they were waiting for a backlash.\n\nJeff Astle died in 2002 of a degenerative brain disease caused by heading footballs\n\n\u2018If you\u2019re an academic, life is all about people criticising your work and, at times, tearing it to shreds,\u2019 says Dr Stewart. \u2018It\u2019s all part of the game, a bit like rugby where you knock seven shades out of each other and go and have a beer afterwards.\n\n\u2018But I think it has been harder for people like the Astle family, Amanda Kopel, Andy MacLeod, who is the son of Ally, who\u2019ve had quite unacceptable behaviour that they\u2019ve had to deal with on social media. The denials and \u2018you\u2019re messing with the game\u2019 \u2026 it\u2019s difficult.\u2019\n\nIt is a poignant moment. For the family of West Brom legend and England international Jeff Astle, who died at 59, this is about more than statistics and science, as daughter Dawn expresses eloquently.\n\n\u2018These deaths should remain on the conscience of the game forever,\u2019 she said. \u2018All our families are due an apology. The massive responsibility of all this, players dying and the health of future generations ended up with us. It should never have been us.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t care what the FA and PFA say, this research would not have been done if we had not shamed them, cornered them, into doing it.\n\n\u2018All these wasted years of non-action. We could have known sooner and so could the others who are maybe awaiting a similar destiny.\n\n\u2018At a time when we should have been grieving a dad, a husband, a granddad, we ended up fighting for justice and to find answers. We feel we don\u2019t have to keep justifying it any more.\u2019\n\nJeff Astle's daughter Dawn says research wouldn't have been done if her family hadn't shamed the FA and PFA\n\nIt is a poignant moment for Kopel, who likewise has been tireless in her campaigning since the death of her husband Frank, who played for Dundee United and died of dementia in 2014, and for the families of England World Cup legends Nobby Stiles and Martin Peters, who are living with dementia.\n\nAnd these are just the most high-profile names, representative of many more lower-league footballers, rugby players and others.\n\n\u2018We can often be tied up in the numbers and the spreadsheets and the science and the microscopes and forget what we\u2019re actually doing is working for people who are affected by this,\u2019 says Dr Stewart.\n\nThe Astle family participated in the brain donation programme he leads at Glasgow University, which enabled him to reveal that Jeff had died of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degeneration of the brain caused by repeated blows to the head.\n\n\u2018In reality it has been six years getting to this point [delivering research] but it has been 20 years for the Astle family and as long for many others. It\u2019s been a long old journey.\u2019\n\nDaughter Clare, grandson Joseph and widow Laraine on Jeff Astle Day at West Brom\n\nDawn Astle says her family should have been grieving for her father, not fighting for justice\n\nFor the few who still question why this is important and querying Dr Stewart\u2019s motives, this is a man who loved amateur rugby as a youth and student, playing for Cambuslang.\n\nOn his screen saver is a cherished memory of Scotland beating Australia at Murrayfield, a game he attended with his daughter. Married with two daughters, who are 21 and 19 and hockey players, this is a man who has a deep love of sport and the joys it brings.\n\nHe will always stress the health benefits but has been unafraid to probe into areas some would rather he had not. Dr Stewart\u2019s commitment to this research goes back 20 years. He is gracious to those who once resisted him.\n\n\u2018Football as a sport and the FA have got it in the neck but credit to the FA and the PFA, because these organisations stood up when all the other organisations didn\u2019t and funded this research.\u2019\n\nDr Stewart is clear that his team\u2019s research does not pinpoint that heading is the reason why footballers are more likely to die of brain diseases. It has simply established the fact that they do. \u2018Given that research from people with head injuries in car crashes had produced similar results, it is a working hypothesis that exposure to head injuries, through collisions or fouls or heading, could be the decisive factor.\u2019\n\nFootball has taken some steps to recognise the importance of treating concussion, after previous research established a link between concussion and dementia.\n\nDr Willie Stewart (right) says the three-minute window to assess players on the pitch for concussion is woefully inadequate\n\nWorld football now has a six-day ban from playing once concussion is diagnosed and had established a three-minute window to assess players on the pitch. Dr Stewart says the three-minute window is woefully inadequate.\n\nFootball is reluctant to allow a 10-minute temporary sub for fear of coaches gaming the system for tactical advantage.\n\nCurrently, once the three-minute on-pitch football window is over the doctor has to continue any diagnosis off the pitch, leaving the team a player short.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s horrendous,\u2019 said Dr Stewart. \u2018I can\u2019t imagine how you could possibly do it. Leaving aside the pressure of looking at a player on the pitch, if you add in 50,000 people baying for the game to go on and throw in a TV audience and a player who\u2019s desperate to play, that\u2019s just not the way doctors operate.\n\n\u2018We like a quiet space and time. It should be directed by medical requirements, which is take them off the pitch and assess them properly.\u2019\n\nHe says that further research is required over the next 30 years to isolate the reasons for the links. \u2018We could do very sophisticated targeted studies on a smaller numbers of players.\n\n\u2018Rather than looking at 8,000 players, let\u2019s look at 100 but let\u2019s look at how their brain is working in five years, then in 10 years. At 50 their brains might be the same but when you get to 55 or 60 there might be slight differences.\n\n\u2018No-one might have dementia but the brains are beginning to show differences. I\u2019ve no illusions that the answer is going to come in my working life span, but here\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t set up now.\u2019\n\nAs for the backlash this week? \u2018We were set for the flak for saying that there may be something wrong with the beautiful game but I\u2019ve been amazed at how there has been virtually none.\u2019\n\nIf you would like to know more about donating your brain after death \u2014 especially if you have suffered a traumatic brain injury, such as in a car crash or assault, or have participated in contact sport \u2014 please register at https://gbirg.inp.gla.ac.uk/register-for-brain-donation/", "description": "INTERVIEW BY ROB DRAPER AND JAMES SHARPE: Willie Stewart and his colleagues sat in Glasgow University's communications department last Monday at midday.", "authors": ["Rob Draper And James Sharpe For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/23/20227830-0-image-a-11_1572128501902.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
