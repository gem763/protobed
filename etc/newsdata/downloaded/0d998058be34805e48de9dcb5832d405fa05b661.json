India followed the move by sending in tens of thousands of extra troops, detaining thousands of people and blocking cellphone and internet services.\n\nResidents appeared relieved Monday after facing difficulties during the long communications embargo. But the region continues to simmer with anger.\n\n\u201cIt is a relief,\u201d said Mohammad Akram, a trader. He was, however, quick to add how Kashmiris are expected \u201cto thank the government for giving them basic amenities.\u201d\n\nSome said that having no lines of communication for the past two months was akin to living in the Stone Age.\n\n\u201cThank you, India. You have finally decided to partially restore our digital rights,\u201d said Sameer Ahmad, a college student. \u201cWhen will you restore our political rights?\u201d\n\nFacing international pressure to ease people\u2019s suffering and restore normal life, Indian authorities announced last week that they would allow tourists back into the region after ordering them to leave in August because of security concerns. The government has said that internet facilities are being opened at tourist spots in the region.\n\n\u201cWhatever India does in Kashmir, it is driven to consolidate its position,\u201d said Ali Mohammad, a schoolteacher. \u201cThey stopped phones and internet services to stop us from registering protests. Now they are restoring these services to cater to tourists and declare normalcy in Kashmir.\u201d\n\nThe authorities have put out newspaper ads aiming to send across a message of normalcy in the region. A full-page advertisement in Friday\u2019s Greater Kashmir daily urged people to reopen their shops and send their children back to school.\n\nAuthorities also released three low-ranking politicians in the region last week. However, prominent Kashmiri politicians, including some who have historically accepted India\u2019s sovereignty over the disputed Muslim-majority region, remain detained in their homes or in jails.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Postpaid cellphone services were restored in India-administered Kashmir on Monday, more than two months after India's government downgraded the region's semi-autonomy and imposed a security and communications lockdown.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aijaz Hussain"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/india_kashmir_cellphones_32653_c0-216-5184-3240_s1200x700.jpg?48c42b2789ee0d08ce9a91ab8317603cc81a12f8", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
