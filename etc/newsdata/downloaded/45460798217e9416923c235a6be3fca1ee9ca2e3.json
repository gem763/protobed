My heart went out to her when Bradby asked her how she was handling it all.\n\n\"Thank you for asking,\" Markle said. \"Not many people have asked if I\u2019m OK.\"\n\nBradby then replied gently, \"Would it be fair to say it\u2019s not really been OK? It\u2019s really been a struggle?\"\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE\u2019S \u2018PAIN\u2019 AND \u2018THE ATTACKS SHE FACES\u2019 HAVE MADE PRINCE HARRY DETERMINED \u2018TO SORT IT OUT\u2019: REPORT\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered quickly.\n\nIn that moment, I felt an instant kinship with Markle. Although I\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s like to be part of the royal family or scrutinized and slandered by the tabloids, I remember many times during the last eight years (and four babies) when I could have given the exact same answer.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWith or without the spotlight, being a new mommy is tough. On top of out-of-whack hormones and healing bodies, new moms must deal with a myriad of expectations regarding not only how they care for their child but how they perform as a mom. Through social media, the world portrays an image of motherhood where the baby weight easily disappears, emotions bounce back quickly, and daily life is a blissful lovefest between mom and baby.\n\nWhen I gave birth to my first child, many people asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you just love being a mom?\u201d or \u201cAren\u2019t you in love with your baby?\u201d I always smiled and answered in the affirmative. (I\u2019m not a monster!) But internally, I grappled with a more complex narrative. Yes, I loved being a mom, but I also struggled with the emotions of losing some of my own identity. Yes, I loved my son, but I also didn\u2019t feel 100 percent bonded to him every hour of the day. I was still adjusting to the new normal brought on by this needy stranger crashing into our lives.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMarkle\u2019s interview has sparked an important conversation about the mental health of new mothers. Some have pointed out that, as a society, we don\u2019t ask moms, \"Are you OK?\" I think that\u2019s true. But maybe the bigger issue is that we don\u2019t slow down long enough to listen to the real answer and do something about it.\n\nThere have been many days of motherhood where I have not felt \"OK.\" Often chatting with a friend on the phone, taking a walk with my husband or having someone stop by with coffee has been the thing that brought me back from the ledge. New moms put enough pressure on themselves. Let\u2019s help them know it\u2019s OK not to be OK, and motherhood will get easier. Beyond that, let\u2019s look for ways to lighten their loads as they do the important work of raising the next generation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY SUZANNE GOSSELIN", "description": "New moms put enough pressure on themselves.
