Levy works at his lab at Tufts University in Boston in 1999. (John Tlumacki/Boston Globe)\n\nStuart B. Levy, a physician and microbiologist who sounded the alarm on the dangers of antibiotic resistance, demonstrating that drugs routinely given to fatten farm animals posed a threat to human health, died Sept. 4 at his home in Boston. He was 80.\n\nHe had Parkinson\u2019s disease, said his daughter, Suzanne Levy Friedman.\n\nLong before \u201csuperbugs\u201d became a buzzword for drug-resistant bacteria, Dr. Levy was researching and drawing attention to the issue of antibiotic resistance, which the World Health Organization labeled a \u201cmajor threat to public health\u201d in 2014. In the United States, at least 2 million people get an antibiotic-resistant infection each year and at least 23,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFor decades, much of the country\u2019s antibiotics have gone to farm animals, helping chickens, turkeys, cows and pigs grow bigger and better. In a much-cited 1976 paper, Dr. Levy found that chickens raised on feed with low doses of antibiotics developed drug-resistant bacteria that were then transferred to farmers, posing a significant health risk.\n\n\u201cFor many years he was a voice in the wilderness, talking about things that were not a part of the conventional wisdom,\u201d said Martin J. Blaser, a Rutgers University microbiologist. \u201cWhen people like Stuey said, \u2018We\u2019re wasting our precious patrimony for a few dollars,\u2019 the [agriculture] industry stonewalled it. He was up against Goliath.\u201d\n\nDr. Levy was based at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, where he taught for 47 years before retiring in 2018, and displayed a literary and artistic side that complemented his immersion in medical science. An English major in college, he struck up a correspondence with Samuel Beckett and met the playwright in Paris. Later, on what his daughter recalled as a trip to Africa, he saw someone playing the ukulele and decided to learn the instrument, strumming his own songs during academic meetings.\n\n\n\nDr. Levy, shown in 2009, advocated what he described as \u201cprudent use\u201d of antibiotics. (Alonso Nichols/Tufts University)\n\nTrained as a hematologist, Dr. Levy continued to see patients decades after beginning his work on antibiotics, invariably greeting them in his white coat and bow tie. His career bridged research and activism: Seeking to translate his findings into public policy, he met with regulators and politicians, discussed antibiotics on TV with Bryant Gumbel and Dan Rather, and wrote a popular 1992 book, \u201cThe Antibiotic Paradox: How Miracle Drugs Are Destroying the Miracle.\u201d\n\nHe also formed the nonprofit Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics and, in 1981, persuaded 147 scientists from 27 countries to sign a statement on antibiotic misuse, according to Scott H. Podolsky, a Harvard professor of global health and social medicine.\n\n\u201cIt was Dr. Levy who catalyzed the transformation of antibiotic resistance into a shared, global concern, mandating global collaborations across various domains of medicine, science, industry, agriculture, and politics,\u201d Podolsky said by email.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Dr. Levy met with legislators such as Rep. Louise M. Slaughter (D-N.Y.), a microbiologist who repeatedly introduced legislation to restrict the use of antibiotics in healthy cattle.\n\nHis efforts found mixed success. Slaughter\u2019s bill never passed (she died last year), but in 2013, the FDA began phasing out the use of certain antibiotics for farm animals. Two years later, President Barack Obama announced a $1.2 billion initiative to identify emerging superbugs and increase funding for new antibiotics and vaccines.\n\n1 of 58 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2019.

Antibiotics were a powerful new tool against once-deadly infections, and were soon used in livestock feed.\n\nBy the early 1960s, scientists including Tsutomu Watanabe had identified bacteria that were newly resistant to the drugs and that spread antibiotic-resistant genetic material among themselves and even to different species.\n\nDr. Levy met Watanabe while in medical school and traveled to Tokyo in 1964, spending a summer in the Japanese researcher\u2019s lab and collaborating with him on several papers. Turning his focus to antibiotic resistance, he conducted his best-known work while sponsored by an unlikely partner, the Animal Health Institute, a trade group that was hoping to demonstrate the effectiveness of antibiotics on farms.\n\nIn 1974, at 36, he devised a study that drew on the poop of 300 Leghorn chickens raised near Boston \u2014 as well as fecal samples from six local families. \u201cWe\u2019re asking you all to be part of an experiment,\u201d he told them over hot dogs and hamburgers, according to Maryn McKenna\u2019s book \u201cBig Chicken.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d like you to donate something that you have to science. Frankly,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe need your sh--.\u201d\n\nThe families obliged, and the results \u2014 published in the New England Journal of Medicine \u2014 disappointed his sponsors and surprised even Dr. Levy. \u201cThese data speak strongly against the unqualified and unlimited use of drug feeds in animal husbandry,\u201d he wrote with his two co-authors, \u201cand speak for reevaluation of this form of widespread treatment of animals.\u201d\n\nMonths later, in 1977, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Donald Kennedy attempted to ban the use of growth-promoting antibiotics. That effort was quickly halted under pressure from industry groups and pharmaceutical companies, who said there were gaps in the research.\n\n\u201cOur study from 1976 was [and still is] the only prospective U.S. study on this, and industry didn\u2019t want more studies,\u201d Dr. Levy told the Scientist magazine in 2015. \u201cThey were upset that our data showed them to be wrong. This was highly political.\u201d\n\nStuart Blank Levy was born in Wilmington, Del., on Nov. 21, 1938. His mother was a homemaker, and his father was a physician who conducted house calls, sometimes taking payment in the form of produce from local farmers.\n\nAll three of the Levy children went into medicine. Dr. Levy\u2019s identical twin brother, Jay A. Levy, is a cancer and AIDS researcher at the University of California at San Francisco, where his lab was one of the first groups to isolate HIV; his sister, Ellen Levy Koenig, also studies the AIDS virus.\n\nThe brothers were close enough that they executed an unannounced identity switch for one week in college, with Stuart attending Wesleyan University in Connecticut while Jay took his place at Williams College in Massachusetts, where Dr. Levy graduated in 1960.\n\nDr. Levy received a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1965, completed his residency at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and performed postdoctoral research at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.\n\nIn 1971, he became a professor at Tufts, where he directed the Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance. He was president of the American Society for Microbiology and wrote more than 300 papers, including an influential 1978 study that identified the role of \u201cefflux pumps\u201d in antibiotic resistance.\n\nWith Walter Gilbert, a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist, he also founded a pharmaceutical company, Paratek, to develop new antibiotics.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 35 years, the former Cecile Pastel, a French-born dermatologist who lives in Boston; three children, Suzanne Levy Friedman of Washington, Arthur Levy of San Francisco and Walter Levy of Boston; and his two siblings.\n\nIn interviews, Dr. Levy often spoke of antibiotic stewardship \u2014 a concept that is sometimes referred to as \u201cstuartship,\u201d in his honor \u2014 while urging patients and doctors to avoid taking the drugs for minor ailments. \u201cBacteria have seen dinosaurs come and they\u2019ve seen them go,\u201d he told Rather in 2011. \u201cSo we aren\u2019t going to destroy the bacterial world. We live in the bacterial world.\u201d", "description": "He called for \u201cprudent use\u201d of antibiotics, in livestock feed as well as in the hospital.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VyPnuEv4lmEvEZHylLi6Qarera8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BCYMEJG3EEI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
