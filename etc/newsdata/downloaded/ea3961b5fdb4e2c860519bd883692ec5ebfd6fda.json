The DJIA last traded at 26,486.23.\n\nMajor US stock indexes all rose today, as the S&P 500 (+1.11%) tracked closely with the Dow. The Nasdaq led the way again, rallying 1.15%.\n\nCommodity prices were highly mixed, with no real direction across energy markets, and gold and silver dropped.\n\nFurther confirmation of risk-on was seen as the Australian dollar rallied 0.43% against the US dollar, while the trade war risk barometer, USD/CNH (offshore yuan), dropped as well.\n\nWhat Moved the Markets Today\n\nThe US jobs report was widely touted as a success after the Dow rallied strongly at the open of trade. It appears the bounce may have been due to expectations of truly horrendous data which did not materialize.\n\nNevertheless, there was still plenty of evidence that the report was in line with the view that the US economy is slowing. Sharply dropping unemployment, combined with a contradictory miss in wages, must be viewed with caution.\n\nLarry Kudlow added a boost to stocks as he hinted at some surprises next week for investors in the US-China trade talks. Investors took it as further evidence that Trump and his team are laying a trail of bullish breadcrumbs for investors that a trade deal is coming before the 2020 election.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell capped off a busy week as he spoke late in the session, helping lift stocks by hinting at measures to boost inflation.\n\n\u201cWhile we believe our strategy and tools have been and remain effective, the US economy, like other advanced economies around the world, is facing some longer-term challenges,\u201d Powell said.\n\nTrade Balance Suggests More Trump Tariff Woes for Stock Market\n\nAside from the jobs data, the trade balance was also wider than expected. Given that Trump has made trade a particular focus of his political agenda, tariff escalation remains a significant threat to the global stock market, along with the Dow Jones.\n\nIn an ING report, Chief International Economist James Knightley explains that other nations continue to pick up the slack from China to fill US orders, as he writes:\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is likely to take some comfort from the fact that the trade deficit with China narrowed yet again, which he can use to justify his tough rhetoric in trade negotiations. On a year-to-date basis, the trade deficit with China has narrowed by US$30bn. Unfortunately, this has been fully offset by a YTD increase in the trade deficit with Mexico of US$15.8bn and US$14.9bn with the EU. In aggregate the US trade deficit is currently on track to be broadly in line with the record trade deficit experienced last year.\u201d\n\nDespite the administration\u2019s frequent claims, US manufacturing is not feeling the benefit of the trade war. Trump may have to do more to fight the free market, an exceptionally worrying consideration for stocks worldwide.\n\nDow Stocks: Buoyant Apple Carries The Load\n\nThe Dow 30 enjoyed a strong rally led primarily by Apple (+2.6%) as reports surfaced that the tech giant is increasing the output of the iPhone 11 on better than expected demand.\n\nDisney rose more than 1.3% as bulls appeared to enjoy its decision to block Netflix ads from all its channels, excluding ESPN.\n\nOnly Dow Inc. traded in the red, falling 0.26% as the other 29 DJIA components reported session gains.\n\nClick here for a live Dow Jones Industrial Average chart.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/donald-trump-dow-china-trade-afp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
