(Photo by Bob Chamberlin/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nSamuel Little made headlines earlier this year when the FBI sought the public\u2019s help in identifying his many victims by releasing his drawings of them, but now the Los Angeles Times has an in-depth piece detailing how Texas Ranger James Holland convinced Little \u2014 who claims to have killed 93 women over the course of four decades, making him one of the most prolific serial killers in American history \u2014 to talk.\n\nLittle was already serving a life sentence for three murders in Los Angeles when Holland first met him, and after 650 hours of interviews over the course of 16 months, Holland and his team have been able to confirm 57 of Little\u2019s 93 confessions. \u201cSamuel Little has given me a massive gift, a gift to bring closure to victims\u2019 families who have gone years without knowing what really happened to their loved ones,\u201d Holland told the Times. \u201cI have a responsibility. It is a big one. I feel it. I have to run with this and take it wherever it goes, do whatever it takes. And we know time is slipping away.\u201d\n\nHolland stressed the importance of being able to provide closure to the families of Little\u2019s victims. \u201cSo we took something of a blood oath: \u2018Confessions are great. But nothing means anything until we prove these all up,'\u201d he said.\n\nOne breakthrough between Holland and Little happened when the detective promised that prosecutors would not seek the death penalty if Little confessed to additional murders. Four hours after receiving a letter confirming that he would not get the death penalty, Little confessed to 17 more killings.\n\nUltimately, Holland told the Times, Little is a \u201csociopath with extreme psychopathic tendencies.\u201d \u201cThe man is an absolute genius, and he has a sickness,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know why, and I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Los Angeles Times", "description": "James Holland and his team confirmed 57 of Samuel Little's 93 confessions so far, thanks to Holland's 650 hours of interviews with the serial killer.", "authors": ["Bonnie Stiernberg"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-567384237.jpg?fit=1024%2C683", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
