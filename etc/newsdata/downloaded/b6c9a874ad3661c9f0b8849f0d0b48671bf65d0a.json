(Farah Abdi Warsameh/AP)\n\nAl-Shabab, a Somali militant organization affiliated with al-Qaeda, claimed two attacks in Somalia on Monday, both targeting Western forces backing the government.\n\nThe U.S. Africa Command and the Somali government said no coalition members were injured or killed, but the brazenness of the attacks highlighted the insurgent group\u2019s continued ability to destabilize the country.\n\nOne attack, apparently led by an explosives-laden vehicle and followed by foot soldiers, took place at the gates of Baledogle airfield, where the U.S. military stations drones and trains Somali soldiers. The second took place in the capital, Mogadishu, and involved the bombing of an Italian military convoy returning to base from a training exercise as part of a European Union training mission in Somalia.\n\n\u201cThis attack, though ineffective, demonstrates the direct threat al-Shabaab poses to Americans, our allies, and interests in the region,\u201d said Maj. Gen. William Gayler, U.S. Africa Command director of operations.\n\nIn response, U.S. forces carried out two airstrikes and engaged in small-arms fire with militants, killing 10, U.S. Africa Command said in a statement Monday.\n\nItaly\u2019s Defense Ministry said none of its troops were injured in the Mogadishu attack. Somalia\u2019s deputy interior minister, Aden Isak, said the \u201cfailed attack\u201d on the airfield in Baledogle resulted only in the deaths of al-Shabab fighters.\n\n[\u2018If I don\u2019t pay, they kill me\u2019: Al-Shabab tightens grip on Somalia with growing tax racket]\n\nThe U.S. base at Baledogle was recently expanded and is central to the U.S. military\u2019s Somalia strategy, which largely relies on training Somali special forces and using drones to strike al-Shabab targets.\n\nThe U.S. military has conducted 55 airstrikes in Somalia this year, killing more than 300 fighters and continuing an upward year-on-year trend since President Trump relaxed rules of engagement in early 2017. The United States has 650 to 800 Defense Department personnel in Somalia, according to U.S. Africa Command.\n\nThe base is in Somalia\u2019s Lower Shabelle region, where al-Shabab is most active.\n\nAl-Shabab has waged what amounts to a guerrilla war against the Somali government and its foreign backers since it was dislodged from many of southern Somalia\u2019s cities in 2011. The group now controls only rural areas in the south, but it regularly attacks Somali cities. It seeks to take over the government and impose a strict version of Islamic law.\n\nMost analysts put the number of al-Shabab fighters somewhere just short of 10,000, although the true number is hard to discern, as many of the group\u2019s members blend into civilian life. The group has carried out near-daily attacks across Somalia this year, killing more than 1,600 people, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.\n\nRead more:\n\nNew report alleges U.S. airstrikes are killing civilians in Somalia\n\nThe U.S. is pouring millions into Somalia despite concerns over dependency on aid\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "U.S. forces carried out two airstrikes in response to the attacks, killing 10 militants, U.S. Africa Command said in a statement.", "authors": ["Max Bearak", "Africa Bureau Chief Based In Nairobi", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZATYcgyzNtTYm8pIt1UTVErRPEM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4MPJHIHDPUI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
