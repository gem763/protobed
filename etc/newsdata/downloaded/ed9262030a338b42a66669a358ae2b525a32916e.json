The post-money valuation of MX Player was over $500 million, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.\n\nThe addition of Tencent \u2014 which has invested in a handful of Indian startups including Times Internet-owned Gaana, ride-hailing giant Ola, ed tech startup Byju\u2019s, B2B e-commerce startup Udaan and a bookkeeping service for merchants, Khatabook \u2014 \u201cis a great sign of confidence,\u201d said Satyan Gajwani, vice chairman of Times Internet. \u201cTencent is a leading global force in music and video, and there\u2019s a lot for us to learn and leverage from their capabilities,\u201d he added.\n\nKaran Bedi, CEO of MX Player, said in an interview that the video app will use the fresh capital to double down on producing original TV shows and broadening its catalog of licensed content. The firm, which has so far added 15 original shows to its platform, has already commissioned production of another 20 by year-end, he said.\n\nThe Singapore-headquartered firm\u2019s push into original shows and licensed content underscores one of the strangest evolution for a video app. MX Player originated in Korea as an app that could run video files in a wide-range of formats locally stored on a phone.\n\nThe app did all of this while consuming little resources, an ability that helped it win tens of millions of users with low-cost Android smartphones in emerging markets such as India. In fact, India is MX Player\u2019s largest market, with 175 million monthly active users, Bedi said. Globally, the app has amassed more than 280 million users.\n\nMX Player is ad-supported and does not charge users any monthly subscription fee. The service, which introduced movies and shows streaming in mid-2017, today also offers access to about 200 TV channels, their current and back catalog of shows, and a music streaming feature through an integration with Gaana.\n\nBedi said the company has tied up with all-web show producers such as HoiChoi in India and three of the top five TV local cable networks, including Sony and Sun. Missing from the list is Star India, the largest TV network in the country.\n\nThanks to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Disney now owns Star India. Star India has emerged as one of the gems in Disney\u2019s new portfolio. The firm, which runs dozens of TV channels in India, operates Hotstar, the market-leading video streaming service.\n\nHotstar reported 300 million monthly active users and 100 million daily active users during the ICC Cricket World Cup tournament. The service has cashed in on the popularity of cricket to boost its numbers.\n\nBedi said MX Player is working on building new entertainment experiences, but sports content is not something it is exploring. The reason is simple: Cricket drives most of the sports streaming in India and Star India has secured rights to most of such content. (Facebook recently grabbed a slice of it, too.)\n\nBut cricket alone can\u2019t help a streaming service win and sustain customers. Even Hotstar\u2019s monthly user base plummets below 60 million in the months following the cricketing season, people familiar with Hotstar\u2019s internal figures have told TechCrunch.\n\nFiguring out what exactly resonates with the users in India, the world\u2019s second largest internet market, is the billion-dollar question. The video streaming market in India is on track to be worth $1.7 billion in the next four years, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\nBedi, who spearheaded Eros Now\u2019s India business before joining MX Player, said users are increasingly enjoying the original shows. Most of the shows that MX Player has produced so far, such as \u201cHey Prabhu,\u201d \u201cThinkistan\u201d and \u201cImmature,\u201d are largely targeted at college students and those who have just joined the work force. But the company is slowly populating the platform with shows such as \u201cQueen\u201d that appeal \u201cuniversally,\u201d he said.\n\nMX Player today competes with more than three dozen local and international players, nearly all of which offer their services at dirt-cheap prices in India. Even Netflix, which launched in India with a $8 plan in 2016, this year introduced a $2.8 monthly tier. In recent months, several more firms including e-commerce giant Flipkart and food delivery startup Zomato have launched their video streaming services in the country.\n\nOnce cautious about each megabyte they spent consuming internet services, Indians are now spending about 10GB of data on their smartphones each month as data prices crash in the country, according to an Ericsson report. Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani disrupted the local telecom market in 2016 when he launched Reliance Jio. The 4G-only carrier undercut the market by first offering bulk of mobile data at no cost, and then charging very little fee.\n\nAn analyst TechCrunch spoke with said it\u2019s only a matter of time before India\u2019s video market begins to see some consolidation and pull back. \u201cYou have to offer something appealing that none of your rivals have,\u201d he said, requesting anonymity as he advises many of these businesses.\n\nFor MX Player, its odd evolution story may be its biggest advantage. The app\u2019s local video playback feature continues to draw many to it, and keeps the app among the top rated in Google\u2019s Play Store. Bedi said the startup, which today employs about 300 people, maintains a large team that continues to improve the tech stacks to improve video playback support.\n\nMoving forward, MX Player will also look into expanding to some international markets. It recently started beta testing the video streaming service in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Eventually, the startup hopes to make original shows for these markets that are relevant to the local audience there.\n\nMX Player maintains a premium app on Google Play Store that strips ads for $5. But the app continues to mostly rely on revenue it generates from ads. Times Internet\u2019s Gajwani said that at some point in the future, the video service will expand monetization beyond pure advertising. \u201cThat said, MX is consumed daily as much as the leading TV channel in India, so there\u2019s significant headroom to capture larger advertising spends as well,\u201d he added.\n\nPaytm, a leading financial services firm in India, was also in talks with MX Player to invest in this financial round. It may invest in the video streaming services app at a later stage, a person familiar with the talks said.", "description": "MX Player, a popular video app that offers both local playback and streaming services, said on Wednesday that it has raised $110.8 million in a new financing round led by Chinese internet giant Tencent as the video app looks to expand its business in India and other international markets.
