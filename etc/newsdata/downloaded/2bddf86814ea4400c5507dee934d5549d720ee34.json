This after Police Minister Bheki Cele did not reappoint McBride.\n\nMcBride's CV states that he has worked as a project manager at the department of public service since.\n\nThis week, he was back in the news as he described Mkhwebane's recent report into allegations of maladministration against him as an \"erosion of IPID's independence\" and would probably interrupt IPID's investigations into the alleged corruption and looting within the police as the report implicates most of IPID's executive members.\n\nFormer IPID investigator Cedrick Nkabinde lodged the complaint against McBride with Mkhwebane's office in June 2018. It details alleged irregular appointments, maladministration and protected disclosure regarding alleged unethical conduct by McBride.\n\nANC MPs leaned heavily on Nkabinde's allegations when they decided not to renew McBride's contract in February.\n\nMcBride said he would also take the \"highly questionable\" report on review and said his legal team is looking at it with the eye on approaching the high court to interdict Mkwhebane's remedial actions.\n\nThe CVs of McBride and the other candidates, many of them advocates, can be viewed here.\n\nThe term of the incumbent Deputy Public Protector, Kevin Malunga, comes to an end in December. Hence, the portfolio committee on justice and correctional services recently embarked on a process to fill the post.\n\n\"Members of the public and organisations may comment on the suitability of candidates by no later than 16 October 2019 at 16:00. The shortlisted candidates will be subjected to a screening process,\" Magwanishe said.\n\n\n\nComments must reach Mr Vhonani Ramaano, Committee Secretary, 3rd Floor, 90 Plein Street, Cape Town, 8000 / PO Box 15, Cape Town, 8001 Enquiries: Mr V Ramaano, tel: (021) 403-3820, cell: 083 709 8427, email: Dppvacancy@parliament.gov.za.\n\nThe candidates are:\n\n\n\nAdv Hendry Pietersen\n\nMr Sammy Tlhapi\n\nMr Graehymme Jesus Williams\n\nMr Phumzile Hubert Songo\n\nMr Douglas Dumisani Soci\n\nMr Victor Mavhidula\n\nMs Hilda Harriet Seapei Mekwa\n\nMr Daniel Aubrey Dibetso-Prince\n\nMr Moshoeshoe Jeffrey Toba\n\nMr Johannes Collen Weapond\n\nAdv Kholeka Gcaleka\n\nMs Olwethu Majola-Kinyunyu\n\nMr Buang Jones\n\nMr Robert John McBride\n\nAdvocate Indhera Goberdhan\n\nAdv.
