Rory, you\u2019re going to lose, right?\"\n\nTo which McIlroy gives a confused look and eventually replies in English \"Yeah, sure!\"\n\nAll four players - Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and Hideki Matsuyama \u2013 will go head-to-head in The Challenge: Japan Skins in a unique event to be streamed in full exclusively and free on GOLFTV* internationally and will be sure to thrill millions of golf fans around the world.\n\n*Due to existing rights agreements in the UK and Ireland, fans will be required to subscribe to watch The Challenge.
