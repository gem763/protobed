The family of Jeremy Beren Banner is suing for wrongful death, while asking for damages of more than $15,000. A lawyer for the family announced the lawsuit on Thursday, though it has apparently not yet been filed with the Palm Beach County Clerk.\n\nBanner is the fourth known person to die while using Autopilot, and his family is the second to sue Tesla over a fatal crash involving the technology. In May, Tesla was sued by the family of 38-year-old Wei Huang, who died in 2018 after his Model X crashed into an off-ramp divider with Autopilot engaged.\n\nBanner was killed while driving along a Florida highway at 68 miles per hour on March 1st of this year. His Tesla Model 3 collided with a tractor-trailer that was crossing his path, which tore the roof off of the car. The vehicle ultimately came to a stop about 1,600 feet away from the site of the impact.\n\nBanner activated Autopilot about 10 seconds before he died\n\nIn May, the National Transportation Safety Board revealed in a preliminary report that Banner turned Autopilot on about 10 seconds before the collision. The agency said that the vehicle \u201cdid not detect the driver\u2019s hands on the steering wheel\u201d between about 8 seconds before the crash and the time of impact.\n\nTesla\u2019s account of the crash differed slightly. The company said it told the NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that the vehicle\u2019s data logs showed Banner \u201cimmediately removed his hands from the wheel.\u201d That would mean Banner didn\u2019t comply with the company\u2019s instructions that drivers keep their hands on the wheel while using Autopilot. (Though CEO Elon Musk is often seen on broadcast news demonstrating the opposite behavior.)\n\nBut the NTSB\u2019s language \u2014 \u201cdid not detect the driver\u2019s hands\u201d \u2014 leaves room for the possibility that Banner had his hands on the wheel when he crashed. Autopilot users often receive a warning to apply pressure to the wheel even when they\u2019re already gripping it, and so the exact order of events remains up in the air. The NTSB also said that \u201c[n]either the preliminary data nor the videos indicate that the driver or the ADAS executed evasive maneuvers.\u201d\n\nThe NTSB\u2019s full investigation is likely to take as long as another year to be completed. A lawyer for Banner\u2019s family said in a press conference Thursday that Tesla has video of the accident from the car\u2019s onboard cameras, but it\u2019s unclear if the family has been given access to that footage.\n\nTesla also often reminds drivers that they need to supervise Autopilot at all times, though the company still markets and sells an Autopilot package it calls \u201cfull self-driving.\u201d Musk has said in the past that serious crashes involving Autopilot are often the result of the \u201ccomplacency\u201d of \u201cinexperienced user[s].\u201d\n\nMusk has said the \u201ccomplacency\u201d of \u201cinexperienced user[s]\u201d is to blame for serious crashes\n\n\u201cThey just get too used to it. That tends to be more of an issue. It\u2019s not a lack of understanding of what Autopilot can do. It\u2019s [drivers] thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do,\u201d he said in 2018.\n\nThe circumstances of Banner\u2019s crash very closely resemble those of the first high-profile fatality involving Autopilot. In 2016, 40-year-old Joshua Brown collided with a tractor-trailer that was crossing his path on a Florida highway. Brown was also using Autopilot at the time of his death. Tesla said in 2016 that its camera system failed to recognize the white broadside of the truck against the bright sky. The NHTSA eventually came to the conclusion that Brown was not paying attention to the road, though the NTSB said a lack of safeguards contributed to his death.\n\nThe car Brown was driving had a completely different version of Autopilot which relied on tech from Israeli company Mobileye. But the similarities in the crashes suggest that Tesla didn\u2019t address this issue with Autopilot\u2019s ability to recognize a crossing tractor-trailer, regardless of the potential fault of the driver.", "description": "Tesla is being sued by the family of a man who died in a crash while using Autopilot in March.
