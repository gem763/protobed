REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Geraint Thomas will ride in both the individual time trial and road race at next week\u2019s UCI Road World Championships in Yorkshire, British Cycling said on Wednesday.\n\nWelshman Thomas, the 2018 Tour de France winner, had targeted the time trial as a late-season goal after finishing runner-up at this year\u2019s Tour to Ineos team mate Egan Bernal.\n\nAlex Dowsett, the British time trial champion, will also contest the TT on Sept. 25.\n\nBritain have named only six riders, rather than eight, after falling outside the top-10 ranked nations.\n\nThomas will be joined in the road race by Ben Swift, Owain Doull, Tao Geoghegan Hart, Ian Stannard and Adam Yates.\n\n\u201cWe have such a talent pool of elite men\u2019s road riders in this country that final selection was quite tricky even though the course is so challenging,\u201d said Matt Brammeier, British Cycling\u2019s elite men\u2019s road coach.\n\n\u201cLooking at the time trial, we have selected two very experienced time trial riders this year in G (Thomas) and Alex, both of whom suit the course and as such we can expect to see good performances from them both.\n\n\u201cG will then stick around to compete in the road race on the Sunday, and will no doubt be a valuable asset to the team in the final laps.\u201d\n\nThe elite men\u2019s road race is a hilly 284.5km course starting from Leeds and taking in seven laps of the Harrogate circuit. The time trial is a 32.5km course from Ripon to Harrogate.", "description": "Geraint Thomas will ride in both the individual time trial and road race at next week's UCI Road World Championships in Yorkshire, British Cycling said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431357153&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1TV", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
