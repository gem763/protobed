In reality, after-market trading can continue on into the late afternoon and evening. Not every brokerage allows for after-market or after-hours trades, though. But if yours does, it\u2019s important to understand the rules, pros and cons before venturing in. A financial advisor can help you get into the after-market trading game if you aren\u2019t sure where to start.\n\nWhat Is After-Market Trading?\n\nWith most stock exchanges, including the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, the regular stock trading session stretches from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. As its name indicates, after-market trading begins once the markets are officially closed for the day. In the U.S., this trade window usually lasts from 4 p.m. to around 8 p.m. For early risers, there\u2019s also pre-market trading hours that being before 9:30 a.m.\n\nAfter-market trades are completed through electronic communication networks, or ECNs. These frameworks make it possible for buyers and sellers to connect without the aid of a traditional stock exchange. Both individual and institutional investors can gain access to an ECN.\n\nECN trading is a relatively simple process. You place an order to buy a specific number of shares at a set price. The ECN then searches to see if that number of shares is available at your target price. If the network locates a suitable counterpart, it executes the trade. There is, of course, always the chance that the shares aren\u2019t available, in which case the trade will stall.\n\nDo All Brokerages Offer After-Hours Trading?\n\nThe short answer is no, after-market trades aren\u2019t a service every brokerage provides. If the one you use does, it\u2019s important to understand the rules for what you can and can\u2019t trade. For example, brokerages usually only allow you to use limit orders to buy, sell or short stocks. Mutual funds, bonds, options and futures can\u2019t be traded during after-hours sessions.\n\nYou should also be aware of any extra fees your brokerage may charge for after-hours trades. While standard commission charges are normal when buying and selling, these potential fees will make your trades slightly pricier. This might not make much of a difference if you\u2019re trading on a smaller scale. But if you\u2019re a big spender, another fee can quickly make things add up.\n\nBenefits of Making After-Market Trades\n\nAfter-Market Trading More\n\nThere are a couple reasons you might consider trading after hours. Rather than being forced to trade within the confines of a schedule, after-market trading allows for increased convenience.\n\nThis is especially helpful for those that don\u2019t have the time to monitor the market or make trades during the day. As the late afternoon and early evening approaches, though, after-hours trades can help you get caught up. This allows you to still be an active trader on a schedule that works best for you.\n\nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, after-market trades offer an opportunity to take advantage of emerging trends or news events. Let\u2019s say a company announces a merger or release its latest earnings report after regular business hours. By jumping into the after-hours market, you can buy or sell shares in real-time versus having to wait until the next day.\n\nDownsides of Trading After-Hours\n\nThe act of trading any type of investment always carries a certain amount of risk. There are some unique factors, however, to note when it comes to after-market trades.\n\nKeep in mind that not every investor is trading after-hours. When there are fewer people active, you might find it harder to buy or sell at a quick pace. This can result in a wider than normal gap between the highest price offered by buyers (the bid) and the lowest price sellers are offering (the ask). You may also have a harder time converting shares to cash.\n\nNot all stocks are actually able to be traded after-hours. So, if some breaking news releases, you might be out of luck if that company\u2019s shares are unavailable during after-market sessions. Or, if you\u2019re waiting until the end of the day to trade for the sake of convenience, your choices may be limited.\n\nStory continues", "description": "You might assume that once the closing bell rings, stock market trading is done for the day.
