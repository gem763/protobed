For almost a month, people here have been without internet or cell phone service, and have been banned from gathering in public.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling party suspended the autonomy of the states of Jammu and Kashmir on Aug. 5, and has sent an additional 35,000 troops to quell the resistance in this picturesque Himalayan valley.\n\nBut one neighborhood in Srinagar is resisting the occupation. Young men from his neighborhood have dug up trenches, take turns guarding barricades blocking their streets, and throw stones at security forces when they try to force their way in at all hours of the night.\n\n\u201cWe stay up all night, our boys stand up to them. There are at least 300-400 people here.\u201d Mohammed, a protester in Soura, an enclave of Kashmir\u2019s capital, told VICE News.\n\n\u201cThey use a lot of shotgun pellets, tear gas, and power shells, but by the grace of god they haven\u2019t succeeded.\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as there are men living here, we won\u2019t let them in.\u201d\n\nKashmir used to be India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. Now, it will become two federally administered territories, giving the central government direct control over an area that\u2019s been the focal point of three wars with Pakistan, its nuclear-armed neighbor, and a 30-year-long separatist insurgency.\n\nMore than 150 people have been injured in clashes with the police since the lockdown began.\n\nHassan, who is also from Soura, was on the frontlines of one of the first protests when police shot him with a pellet shotgun.\n\n\u201cThe doctor says that it was a full cartridge, and the pellets penetrated inside my body.\u201d Hassan told VICE News. \u201cSome people lost their eyes.They also captured five or six boys and we have no news about them to this day.\u201d\n\nWhile many have been arrested during protests, others have been taken from their homes in the night. Security forces have detained thousands, and reports suggest some have been tortured, though officials have denied these claims.\n\n\u201cThe police raids several places at night. Sabotaging takes place,\u201d Hayat Ahmed Bhat, a community organizer in Soura told VICE News. \u201cThey take small children, God knows where they take them, and they don\u2019t release them. We can\u2019t even comprehend what's going on in Jammu and Kashmir right now.\u201d\n\nBhat spent nearly two years in jail in \u201cpreventive detention\u201d and was released before the lockdown began. He immediately started organizing from the local mosque. The government spies on his rallies with drones as they\u2019ve been unable to shut them down.\n\nBhat continues to organize despite his concerns for his family. He worries he will be arrested again if his neighborhood is overrun by the army.\n\n\u201cGod willing we will completely resist this campaign.\u201d Bhat said. \u201cWe have decided that until Article 370 is brought back, and Jammu and Kashmir get its rights\u2026. And all the local captives are released, no Kashmiri, will sit here peacefully.\u201d\n\nCover: A protester in Srinagar chants Islamic slogans and calls for freedom in response to India\u2019s decision to revoke article 370 from the constitution.
