The still-working copywriter does yoga and dance and doesn't relate to the way marketers target over 50s.\n\nCandide McDonald, 63, says marketers and creatives need to better understand the value of her growing tribe of active, vibrant over 50s. Renee Nowytarger\n\n\"The overarching thing is patronising us,\" McDonald says. \"There is very little advertising directed at over 50s and it speaks to us in stereotypes - the current one being that we are \u201ccanny\u201d, our ideal holiday is a river cruise, or we are fabulous people for one, being a bit active. Or two - not leaving our funeral to our kids.\"\n\nMcDonald says the voice marketers use to speak to over 50s reminds her of a teacher patting a child on the head. She says societal stigma and stereotypes perpetuated in media and advertising dictate to people of all ages what they can and can't do, and the problem is people start believing it, turning it into a self-perpetuating prophecy.\n\n\"My motto for my age group is 'say I can because if we say I can\u2019t then everyone else will think so'. People my age love that motto,\" McDonald says.\n\nMcDonald has two jobs \u2013 her own business and freelance work. She does dance everyday \u2013 jazz, funk, hip hop, commercial, ballet - up to 11 classes per week. She doesn't follow any special diet, but eats healthily and doesn't drink.\n\n\"Yes, exercise makes you sore. Yes, exercise results in injuries. No it's not an age thing. At Sydney Dance Company everyone who works hard is sore. I do yoga (a bit) to help my dance ambitions. I walk everywhere rather than take the car if I can.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why is listening to over 50s important for marketers?\n\nThe over 50s market constitutes 27 per cent of the Australian population, have 50 per cent of Australia's private wealth, and hold the purse to 46 per cent of disposable income.\n\nAnd far from being technophobes, they spend $40 billion more than Millennials and Gen X each year buying products online.\n\nHerceg says that marketers are failing to speak meaningfully to this age group for three reasons.\n\nOne, many resort to lazy, stereotypes. Two, the structure of the advertising industry means that many agencies are stacked with younger staff in charge of media buying and filling creative briefs who may not understand the lived experience of older generations. And three, \"ageism\" can result in an obsession with \"youth\", and a culture where people avoid thinking and talking about ageing because it means reflecting on the inevitability of death, which can be a hard concept to confront.\n\n\"Apart from the obvious sectors such as retirement, aged care and health services, many organisations are at risk of inadvertently ignoring a growing and wealthy market,\" Herceg writes.\n\n\"Ageing is poorly understood, particularly by business and marketers who largely ignore or misfire with this audience. Ageing is a pejorative and older people are rarely seen as ideal consumers. The fallacy is that they can't do tech. They're not cool. They're frail. Dull. Sick. They've retired from work and shut the door on meaningful life. They have no aspirations. They're boring, unattractive and irrelevant. None of this is true.\"\n\nThe research also found that 69 per cent of respondents said that age has never been less relevant, and 78 per cent feel much younger than their age.\n\nAlmost two-thirds (61 per cent) say they're living the best years of their life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHerceg also notes that while the younger generations may well be earlier adopters of social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, the fastest growing segment on all social channels is 50 plus.\n\nElder versus elderly\n\nAt 50, fitness entrepreneur Mike Britton is starting to reflect on what this next phase of life is all about.\n\nOriginally from South Africa, he lives a fit and active life on Sydney's Northern Beaches.\n\nHe relates to this idea of marketers missing the mark both in regards to his own life and the ways in which he thinks about speaking to his target audience for his latest venture, the 22 Movement, an online wellness and meditation course for men.\n\nHe thinks marketers need to distinguish between \"elder\" and \"elderly\", and that even this idea of \"over 50s\" falsely homogenises a broad range of life stages.\n\n\"We have to acknowledge that we age \u2026 But I'm being related to like I'm entering this next twilight phase,\" Britton says, who was putting one of his babies from his second marriage into the car during this interview.\n\n\"But I do not actually behave like my father did in his 50s. It's not just being active, it's fashion, looking after children. I relate to myself like I'm younger, and I believe that my body works better than my father's, but I have to acknowledge that there is an ageing process. I can feel the ageing process.\"\n\nIt's not about donning ripped jeans or trying to act younger, he says, but about acknowledging that what it means to be 50-something nowadays has fundamentally shifted given we live longer and our quality of life has evolved.\n\n\"I\u2019m trying to explore and start to understand what that ageing process is in a whole new paradigm, for which we have no real past experience. So, we can't really draw from the past to determine what this is.\"", "description": "A whopping 94 per cent of people over 50 dislike the way brands and advertisers communicate with them.
