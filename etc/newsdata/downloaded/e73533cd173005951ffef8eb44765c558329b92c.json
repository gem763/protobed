After his release he will be restricted from gaming for two years, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn December 2017, Viner, an Ohio gamer, made a $US1.50 ($2) bet with Tyler R. Barriss through the Call of Duty: WWII game, pressing Barriss to falsely report that another gamer, Shane Gaskill, was holding his own family hostage. Barriss has a history of this form of harassment known as \u201cswatting,\u201d in which culprits make bogus emergency calls in an effort to get law enforcement to arrive at the victim\u2019s home.\n\nHowever, the Wichita, Kansas address that Barriss called in was the old address of the intended target and it belonged to a different person \u2014 Andrew Finch, a father of two who had no connection to the intended victim or the gaming community.\n\nThe police arrived at Finch\u2019s address and reportedly killed him when Finch opened the door.\n\nGaskill was charged as a co-conspirator since he had given Barriss his old address, and taunted him to \u201ctry something,\u201d as AP reports.\n\nIn March, Barriss was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his involvement in this incident as well as other phony swatting calls.\n\nThe next month, Viner plead guilty to felony charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy. According to the AP, he admitted he attempted to conceal his involvement in the swatting after he realised it led to someone\u2019s death. He reportedly thought at the time that a guilty plea would help him avoid jail time.\n\nViner had turned 18 two weeks before the incident took place. Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Barnett told the court that due to Viner\u2019s age, probation, rather than prison, would allow him to get a better understanding of what he had done.\n\n\u201cAt his age and his youthfulness, I am not sure he is going to get it if he is sitting in a cell block with people who are more hardened, more experienced than he is,\u201d Barnett said, according to the AP\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Eric Melgren believed that a prison sentence for Viner was necessary due to the seriousness of the crime and to show the public that the justice system works, according to AP.\n\nAccording to AP, a U.S. federal indictment states that a search of Viner\u2019s phone found a deleted message in which he wrote \u201cI was involved in someone\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nFinch\u2019s family filed a suit against the police officer who was killed Finch. The officer, who said he believed Finch was reaching for a gun, was never charged.", "description": "The second gamer involved in a swatting case that began with a Call of Duty bet and ended with police killing an innocent man has been sentenced....", "authors": ["Victoria Song", "Germain Lussier"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ds3ewi9fjhkzkvvkdlmn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
