The prognosis then was severe and far too short: She was given three to five years to live and spent the next two years undergoing multiple rounds of chemotherapy and other treatments.\n\nBut doctors have since told her there is little else they can do to treat her and that she might have a year left. Instead of succumbing to the news, however, she became determined to make sure she can choose to end her own life if the suffering she might endure in the future overtakes the joy of living.\n\n\u201cThe last thing in the world I want to do is die, but it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cThis should be my decision and my decision only.\u201d\n\nIf that time does come, Hanna, who also has two young grandchildren, will empty a prescription of powdered medication into a glass of water or juice and drink it while surrounded by Jerry, 46, a welder, and her four grown children.\n\nShe will fall asleep within minutes and die within an hour.\n\n\u2022 For more on Hanna Olivas plans for the end of her life and her fight for other terminally ill patients, subscribe now to PEOPLE or pick up this week\u2019s issue, on newsstands now.\n\nBecause assisted dying isn\u2019t legal in Nevada, Hanna and Jerry will first have to move to California if she chooses to end her life. (Nine states plus Washington, D.C., allow the terminally ill to die with medical assistance.)\n\nBut she\u2019s not leaving Nevada without a fight.\n\n\u201cI want to die on my own terms,\u201d she says.\n\nSince April, she has been working with the right-to-die advocacy group Compassion & Choices, lobbying her governor and state legislature to guarantee end-of-life options for terminally ill.\n\nHanna\u2019s push for legislation in Nevada \u2014 which failed an April vote but is expected to be reintroduced in January \u2014 was inspired by the activism of Brittany Maynard, the 29-year-old newlywed with terminal brain cancer who made a crusade of her move from California to Oregon to end her life in November 2014 under Oregon\u2019s \u201cdeath with dignity\u201d law. California approved a similar law 11 months after Maynard\u2019s death.\n\nUnder these laws, mentally sound, terminally ill adults with less than six months to live are eligible for lethal medication if they get two doctors to certify mental capability and issue a prescription.\n\nRELATED: Right to Die Legalized in California Following Campaign Inspired by Brittany Maynard\n\nHanna, who was teenage sweethearts with Jerry, went their separate ways and each had four children on their own before they reconnected in May 2013.\n\n\u201cIt came very natural,\u201d says Jerry, who proposed to Hanna within months. \u201cWe just picked up where we left.\u201d\n\nHanna was running a mobile hair-and-makeup business that traveled around Nevada, and the happy-go-lucky spouses reveled in spontaneous getaways and beach weekends.\n\n\u201cLife was busy, and I was so excited for what was to come next,\u201d she recalls.\n\nHanna and Jerry Olivas (center, from left) with their two children | Kayla Reefer More", "description": "Las Vegas Mom-of-4's Right to Die Battle After Cancer", "authors": ["Caitlin Keating"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zH6hUgGGhs_8MhIkWoGwVg--~B/aD0xNTYyO3c9MTI4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/921522f4000418ab4198a4585512bd85", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
