They are pictured during pregnancy\n\nMs Hardy, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, is now campaigning for greater awareness of the risks involved with being overdue.. The couple are pictured together\n\nShe told Metro Online: 'She was allowed to grow too big and was slowly strangled.\n\n'You get to the 38 week mark and think, \"I've made it, it's just a waiting game now\", waiting for the baby to be here.\n\n'We never for one second thought we wouldn't have a baby at the end of it. Everyone is very aware of the risk of miscarriage at the beginning of a pregnancy, we all know that those first 12 weeks are high risk, yet no-one ever speaks about there being risks at the end of the pregnancy too.'\n\nA test at 39 weeks revealed Rosie had stopped moving. But medics detected movement on the follow-up hospital visit so Ms Hardy was told to go home.\n\nMost pregnant women can safely go over their due date by a fortnight before a Caesaerian section is carried out.\n\nBut research has shown women who go over the 40-week mark are at an increased risk of stillbirth and neonatal death.\n\nOn February 16, at 41 weeks, Ms Hardy was told her baby had passed away. A few days later, on February 21, she was induced to give birth to Rosie.\n\nAfter the stillbirth, Ms Hardy worried she had done something wrong during what seemed a 'perfect' pregnancy.\n\nBut she soon discovered there were a host of risks for carrying a baby past 40 weeks, and was 'horrified'.\n\nMs Hardy said she feels 'let down' by the NHS for not being made aware of those dangers.\n\nShe believes she would've had a healthy eight-month-old baby if she was induced at 39 weeks.\n\nShe said she did not hold it against those who treated her at hospital because 'they were following protocol', but believe that protocol should change.\n\nThe couple were allowed to spend time with Rosie (pictured) to say their goodbyes at Colchester Hospital's bereavement suite\n\nA final meeting with doctors next week is hoped to uncover the exact reasons for Rosie's death\n\nMs Hardy said she feels 'let down' by the NHS for not being made aware of those dangers\n\nThe couple were allowed to spend time with Rosie to say their goodbyes at Colchester Hospital's bereavement suite.\n\nMs Hardy said it felt like 'they had a real baby for a little while'.\n\nA final meeting with their doctors next week is hoped to uncover the exact reasons for Rosie's death.\n\nThe umbilical cord wrapping around the neck of a baby is 'very common', according to doctors at Montgomery General Hospital, Washington.\n\nBut the incidence of increases over the course of pregnancy, with a risk of 12 per cent at 24 to 26 weeks, and to 37 per cent at full term.\n\nA 'nuchal cord' can interrupt normal blood, nutrient, and oxygen exchange in the womb. This can lead to a variety of injuries, including to the brain.\n\nOther risks of a nuchal cord include the baby moving around a lot, a poorly structured umbilical cord or multiple babies.\n\nThe couple await the arrival of their second baby, whose heartbeat they heard during a scan for the first time this week.\n\nBut Ms Hardy admits she will feel terrified until her baby is in her arms.\n\nThere are more than 3,200 stillbirths every year in the UK, and one in every 225 births ends in a stillbirth.\n\nIn the US, 23,000 babies were stillborn in 2013, which equates to around 5.96 per 1,000 total births.\n\nSeveral risk factors have been identified as being responsible, but many cases of stillbirth remain unexplained.\n\nHaving twins or a multiple pregnancy, being over 35 years of age, a high BMI and smoking and drinking alcohol while pregnant are linked to the deaths.\n\nCatherine Morgan is chief nurse at East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Colchester Hospital.\n\nShe said: \u2018Our top priority is to provide safe, high quality, compassionate health services to the patients we care for every day at the Trust.\n\n\u2018We have carried out a full investigation into what happened after the very sad stillbirth of Miss Hardy\u2019s baby and we express our sincerest condolences to her and her family. We will be meeting with her next week to talk through the findings of that review.\n\n\u2018Patient safety and the delivery of high quality care is very important to us and we strive to continually improve, so we take any lessons learned from our investigations forward to better our services.\u2019\n\nMs Hardy is campaigning for greater awareness of the risks involved with being overdue.
