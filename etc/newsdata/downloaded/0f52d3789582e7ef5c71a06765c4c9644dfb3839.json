Most, if not all, favor ending cash bail, prohibiting private companies from operating prisons, legalizing marijuana and reducing or eliminating mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nYet, nagging questions remain: Who is fully committed to fixing these problems? In other words, which candidate will take action when they stop campaigning and start governing?\n\nIt\u2019s important to examine more than policy positions and take a look at candidates in their entirety. Some have prioritized criminal justice reform throughout their careers. Others have announced policies during this campaign that are at odds with their legislative votes. Others still have made controversial decisions while they worked within the criminal justice system.\n\nBut most have not been heavily involved in the movement to end mass incarceration.\n\nWe are leaders of a national network of formerly incarcerated people who are driving the movement to reimagine justice. Each of us has been previously incarcerated and has felt the impact of the harsh punishment and destructive policies that have made our communities less safe. We are subject matter experts not only because of our lived experience, but because we have spent decades working to fix the destructive policies and systemic failures that we experienced firsthand.\n\nAt long last, the American public has started to recognize the harmful impact of tough-on-crime policies. It is no longer a risk for Democrats to say that mass incarceration must end \u2014 a testament to the tireless work and dedication of thousands of advocates and practitioners, many of whom have a criminal record or have returned to their communities after incarceration. It also is not politically audacious to issue position papers on eliminating mandatory minimum sentences or providing better services for people reentering society. In this day and age, the fact that we cannot punish our way into public safety has been definitively concluded.\n\nBut those running for the highest office in the country must go above and beyond these safe ideas if they want to show that they\u2019re committed to more than just political rhetoric. After all, even the current president has claimed to be a criminal justice reformer. To set themselves apart from politics as usual, candidates must speak directly to the constituencies that have the most at stake on every issue, including mass incarceration.\n\nThere are plenty of criminal justice reform groups out there just like ours, and activists are waiting for the opportunity to talk to candidates about policy. Democrats have given time to groups that deal with gun-control issues and that are led by survivors of mass shootings and family members who have lost loved ones. Beto O'Rourke of Texas met with a little over a dozen veterans in South Carolina to talk about issues that affect them. Sen. Elizabeth Warren spent time in Philadelphia taking questions from teachers.\n\nActivists in the criminal justice movement deserve the same.\n\nMass incarceration and overcriminalization is an issue that affects the families of 2.2 million people in our jails and prisons and 70 million adults with a criminal record.\n\nThis election is an important moment in the movement to end mass incarceration. We have achieved victories across the country by electing progressive prosecutors, eliminating cash bail and restoring the right to vote for people who have served their sentences. The next president has a chance to accelerate these reforms and mark an end to the tough-on-crime era. With such high stakes, the bare minimum won't do. Candidates must make a compelling case not only to the nation at large but especially to those most impacted by criminal justice issues.\n\nWe are formerly incarcerated. But we are citizens. We vote. And, we are influencers in progressive movements that address mass incarceration and related issues. Candidates who commit to direct engagement with us will send a message of hope to energize an army of supporters whose numbers have unfortunately and regrettably grown way too big.\n\nDaryl Atkinson, executive director, Forward Justice\n\nNorris Henderson, executive director, VOTE-NOLA\n\nDeAnna Hoskins, president and CEO, JustLeadershipUSA\n\nVivian Nixon, executive director, College and Community Fellowship", "description": "'We are formerly incarcerated.
