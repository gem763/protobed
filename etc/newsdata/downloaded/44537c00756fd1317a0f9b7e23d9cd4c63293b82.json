Police said a 65-year-old suspect in the hijacking was arrested Thursday on the island of Mykonos in response to a warrant from Germany.\n\nA police spokesman told The Associated Press that the hijacking case involved TWA Flight 847. The flight was commandeered by hijackers shortly after taking off from Athens on June 14, 1985. It originated in Cairo and had San Diego set as a final destination, with stops scheduled in Athens, Rome, Boston and Los Angeles.\n\nThe hijackers shot and killed U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem, 23, after beating him unconscious. They released the other 146 passengers and crew members on the plane during an ordeal that included stops in Beirut and Algiers. The last hostage was freed after 17 days.\n\nA hijacker points his pistol toward an ABC news media crew from the window of the cockpit of the Trans World Airlines jet as the American television crew approaches the jet for an interview at Beirut International Airport, Lebanon, Wednesday, June 19, 1985. Gunmen hijacked TWA flight 847 carrying 153 people on June 14. HERVE MERLIAC\n\nThe suspect was in custody Saturday on the Greek island of Syros but was set to be transferred to the Korydallos high security prison in Athens for extradition proceedings, a police spokeswoman told The Associated Press. She said the suspect was a Lebanese citizen. The spokeswoman spoke on condition of anonymity because the case was ongoing.\n\nPolice refused to release the suspect's name.\n\nIn Beirut, the Foreign Ministry said the man detained in Greece is a Lebanese journalist called Mohammed Saleh and that a Lebanese embassy official planned to try to visit him on Sunday.\n\nHowever, several Greek media outlets identified the detainee as Mohammed Ali Hammadi, who was arrested in Frankfurt in 1987 and convicted in Germany for the plane hijacking and Stethem's slaying. Hammadi, an alleged Hezbollah member, was sentenced to life in prison but was paroled in 2005 and returned to Lebanon.\n\nGermany had resisted pressure to extradite him to the United States after Hezbollah abducted two German citizens in Beirut and threatened to kill them.\n\nHammadi, along with fellow hijacker Hasan Izz-Al-Din and accomplice Ali Atwa, remains on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists. The FBI offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to each man's capture.", "description": "The hijackers shot and killed U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem, 23, after beating him unconscious", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/21/2d12a763-e1a4-4c4c-88d4-77c6fa38800a/thumbnail/1200x630/df86d27439fea206b6609daac560ab53/ap-8506190183.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
