Official President website/Handout via REUTERS\n\nThe departure of Bolton removes one of the strongest advocates of a hard line towards Iran from President Donald Trump\u2019s White House, and raises the prospect of steps to open up negotiations after more than a year of escalating tension.\n\n\u201cAmerica should understand that ... it should distance itself from warmongers,\u201d Iran\u2019s semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted President Hassan Rouhani as saying on Wednesday, without mentioning Bolton.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s policy of resistance will not change as long as our enemy (the United States) continues to put pressure on Iran,\u201d said Rouhani, a pragmatist who won two landslide elections in Iran on promises to open it up to the world.\n\nLast year, the United States pulled out of an international accord between Iran and world powers under which Tehran accepted curbs on its nuclear programme in return for access to world trade.\n\nWashington says the agreement reached by Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama was too weak because many of its terms expire in a decade and it does not cover non-nuclear issues such as Iran\u2019s missile programme and regional behaviour.\n\nThe White House has followed what the administration calls a policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d, including sanctions aimed at halting all Iranian oil exports, saying its ultimate aim is to push Tehran to the table for talks on a new, tougher deal.\n\nImmediately after Bolton\u2019s departure, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that Trump could meet with Rouhani at an upcoming U.N, meeting with \u201cno preconditions\u201d.\n\n\u201cSIGH OF RELIEF\u201d\n\nIran has rejected talks unless sanctions are lifted first. It said on Wednesday that Bolton\u2019s exit had not changed that position.\n\n\u201cThe departure of ... Bolton from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration will not push Iran to reconsider talking with the U.S.,\u201d Iran\u2019s U.N. envoy, Majid Takhteravanchi, was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.\n\nForeign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif slammed the United States for ordering new sanctions on Iran despite Bolton\u2019s departure.\n\n\u201cAs the world ... was breathing a sigh of relief over ouster of #B_Team\u2019s henchman in the White House, (Washington) declared further escalation of #EconomicTerrorism (sanctions) against Iran,\u201d Zarif tweeted. \u201cThirst for war \u2014maximum pressure\u2014 should go with the warmonger-in-chief (Bolton).\u201d\n\nZarif has often said that a so-called \u201cB-team\u201d including Bolton could goad Trump into a conflict with Tehran.\n\nThe United States on Tuesday announced sanctions on a \u201cwide range of terrorists and their supporters\u201d, including Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards. [nL2N261146]\n\nIran says it hopes to save the deal but cannot do so indefinitely if it gets none of its economic benefits. It has responded to U.S. sanctions with steps to reduce its compliance with the accord, and has said it could eventually leave it unless other parties shield its economy from penalties.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s commitments to the nuclear deal are proportional to other parties and we will take further steps if necessary,\u201d Rouhani said.\n\nIran started using advanced centrifuges last week to ramp up output of enriched uranium and reduced its commitments to the nuclear deal, but said it was giving European countries another two months to come up with a plan to protect its economy.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nFrance has proposed giving Iran a multi-billion dollar credit line which would shield it from some impact of U.S. sanctions, although any such deal would require the Trump administration\u2019s tacit approval.\n\n(This story has been refiled to correct spelling of \u2018weak\u2019 in para 6)", "description": "Iran said on Wednesday Washington should distance itself from \"warmongers\" after the resignation of hawkish White House National Security Adviser John Bolton, and Tehran stood by its demand that sanctions be lifted before any talks.", "authors": ["Parisa Hafezi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428662318&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0QP", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
