Nobel triumph", "language": "en", "text": "Addis Ababa (AFP) \u2013 Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed faces stark challenges on the very issues that earned him a Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, and analysts say the coming months may tell whether he can translate this early applause into concrete success.\n\nThe Nobel Committee cited Abiy\u2019s drive to mend fences across the Horn of Africa while also pursuing dramatic reforms at home \u2014 measures that range from the promotion of democracy to women\u2019s rights.\n\nYet many of those areas remain works in progress, with early headline-grabbing steps yet to be followed by the kind of victories that would seal lasting change.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed\u2019s bold leadership has helped drive through positive changes in Ethiopia and achieve rapprochement with Eritrea,\u201d said William Davison, senior analyst for the International Crisis Group (ICG) think tank, referring to the 2018 peace deal with Ethiopia\u2019s neighour.\n\n\u201cBut there is a lot of work to do to achieve a new domestic political settlement between fractious actors, and there are also major obstacles to advancing the Eritrea peace process, suggesting that Abiy\u2019s hardest challenges lie ahead.\u201d\n\n-Foreign policy-\n\nThe Eritrea deal is seen as Abiy\u2019s signature achievement, but it has been weakened by a lack of tangible progress on critical issues like border demarcation.\n\nThe highly-publicised reopening of the countries\u2019 borders was abruptly reversed just a few months later, and there are no signs that will change anytime soon.\n\nAbiy has also played a leading role in mediating Sudan\u2019s political crisis and has tried to revive South Sudan\u2019s uncertain peace deal.\n\nWinning the Nobel will undoubtedly give Abiy a prestige that will add to his power of leverage.\n\nYet whether any of these initiatives, which require gritty long-term solutions, can make headway is an open question.\n\nMichael Woldemariam, an expert on the Horn of Africa at Boston University, told AFP that Abiy\u2019s regional peace-making achievements \u201cremain fragile\u201d.\n\n\u201cBecause of the density of external actors currently involved in Sudan, Abiy\u2019s ability to shape events going forward is limited,\u201d Woldemariam said.\n\n\u201cOn the Eritrea issue, where Abiy naturally has more leverage, his reputation as a peace-builder will be legitimately tested in the coming months.\u201d\n\n-Turbulent home front-\n\nPerhaps more pressing for Abiy is the task of guiding Ethiopia to elections currently planned for next May.\n\nA competitive and credible vote would be perhaps the best possible indication that Ethiopia is breaking with its authoritarian past and that Abiy \u2014 a product of the long-ruling Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition \u2014 is serious about changing direction.\n\nBut human rights groups have sounded the alarm in recent months about a spike in arrests of opposition activists and journalists, some of whom are being held under controversial counterterrorism legislation.\n\nThe arrests picked up following the assassination of five high-ranking political and military officials in June \u2014 an event that highlighted a fragile security situation marred by ethnic violence and widespread internal displacement.\n\nAmnesty International said Friday that these trends indicate that Abiy\u2019s work \u201cis far from done\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis award should push and motivate him to tackle the outstanding human rights challenges that threaten to reverse the gains made so far,\u201d Amnesty said.\n\nAbiy\u2019s loosening of the reins has seen years of tensions between the country\u2019s diverse ethnic groups boil over \u2014 usually over land and resources \u2014 leading to deadly violence in the country that resulted in the world\u2019s largest displacement crisis in 2018.\n\nMore domestic turbulence could be on the way.\n\nAhead of the election, Abiy has been pushing a plan to transform the EPRDF into a political party, a move that risks fracturing alliances that have held for nearly three decades.\n\n-Women\u2019s rights-\n\nThe Nobel committee also praised Abiy\u2019s efforts to promote women\u2019s rights in Ethiopia, though some activists say those reforms have not been as transformative as they first appeared.\n\nAbiy \u201cwowed everyone\u201d by overseeing the appointment of a gender-equal cabinet and the country\u2019s first woman president, but structural challenges that would address problems like gender-based violence have been lacking, said Sehin Teferra, head of the Ethiopian feminist group Setaweet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really worrying how much the gender agenda has kind of been stalled or paused since then,\u201d Sehin said.\n\n-Looking ahead-\n\nThese challenges aside, Abiy has remained publicly committed to his expansive agenda, shrugging off criticism that he is taking on too much too fast.\n\nOn the night before the Nobel was announced, he hosted a 500-person banquet inaugurating the new \u201cUnity Park\u201d in Addis Ababa.\n\nThe project, which involved converting a palace that once housed Ethiopia\u2019s emperors into a museum, is intended to rally Ethiopia\u2019s many ethnic groups behind common national goals of peace and prosperity.\n\nAfter the prize was announced Friday, his office stressed this same goal in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis victory and recognition is a collective win for Ethiopians, and a call to strengthen our resolve in making Ethiopia \u2014 the New Horizon of Hope \u2014 a prosperous nation for all.\u201d", "description": "Addis Ababa (AFP) \u2013 Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed faces
