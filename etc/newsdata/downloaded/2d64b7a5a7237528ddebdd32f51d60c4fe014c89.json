Don\u2019t trust it. (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nA lesson all parents must learn is that you can\u2019t turn your back on children for even two minutes.\n\nIn that time your sweet angel will somehow managed to wreck the house, cover themselves in something gross, or paint their entire face pink.\n\nEven pet parents need to be cautious.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll learn this lesson by having your child do something naughty but ultimately harmless, \u2013 or at least easily fixed \u2013 that you can share on the internet to make everyone laugh.\n\nSuch is the case for Arron Whysall, 27.\n\nThe dad-of-two was outside in the garden fixing a fence while his fianc\u00e9e was doing her hair, leaving his three-year-old daughter, Olivia, alone in the kitchen for 10 minutes.\n\nWhen he returned he found Olivia grinning and smothered in yoghurt with 18 empty pots of Petit Filous on the table in front of her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArron asked Olivia if she had eaten all the yoghurts herself in such a small space of time, she proudly replied \u2018yes\u2019, still holding her spoon.\n\nArron was so stunned he couldn\u2019t even find the words to tell his daughter off.\n\nOlivia posing proudly with the aftermath of eating 18 yoghurts (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nWe can\u2019t blame him. Downing 18 yoghurts in 10 minutes is pretty impressive.\n\nAfter wiping a lot of yoghurt off Olivia\u2019s face, Arron took a photo of the amazing eating feat and posted it on Facebook, where it ended up being shared more than 10,000 times.\n\nArron, of Nottingham, said: \u2018She was quite pleased with herself about it. I just thought fair enough. I couldn\u2019t even tell her off for it because it was just too funny. I was more overwhelmed than anything.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t believe it. I shouted my partner down and she said \u201cthere\u2019s no way she has eaten all of them\u201d.\n\n\u2018But I told her, \u201cI think she has because she\u2019s just told me she has\u201d. It really made us laugh. She obviously really enjoys those yoghurts.\n\n\u2018They aren\u2019t massive pots but just the way she\u2019d got them out the fridge, opened and eaten them all then was sat there still with the spoon in her hand as if to say \u201cgive me more\u201d was so funny.\u2019\n\nIt makes sense that Arron was stunned by Olivia\u2019s stunt.\n\nWhile he was outside working in the garden, Arron kept popping in and out of the house to check on Olivia, who was watching television in the kitchen, and her brother Oscar, six, who was on his Playstation in the living room.\n\nArron with Olivia (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nWhen his son emerged to tell him Olivia was eating \u2018a yoghurt\u2019, Arron told Oscar not to worry as he knew Olivia could manage to open and eat the Petits Filous on her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when Arron went into the kitchen just 10 minutes later to make sure Olivia hadn\u2019t made a mess, the last thing he expected was to discover the three-year-old had eaten every single yoghurt in the fridge.\n\nThe mum and dad were worried the excessive dairy intake might upset Olivia\u2019s tummy but the little girl was her \u2018normal self\u2019 and still managed to polish off her dinner.\n\nArron said: \u2018She does love her snacks. She doesn\u2019t really eat loads at dinner or tea time but if you offer her a yoghurt or fruit, she\u2019ll always find room for it somewhere.\n\n\u2018We did have to pre-warn her grandparents that Olivia had eaten 18 yoghurts and asked them to keep an eye on her but she was fine.\n\n\u2018She was her normal self and ate all her tea, we couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s such a little character, she keeps us busy put it that way.\n\n\u2018If there\u2019s mischief to get up to, Olivia will be the first one there.\u2019\n\nMORE: Ikea is hosting a Christmas buffet in December and yes, there will be meatballs\n\nMORE: The out-of-hours email ban causing stress is proof our working culture needs an overhaul\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Arron was outside in the garden for ten minutes when three-year-old Olivia downed 18 yoghurts, smothering herself with the stuff in the process.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90605897_1571493902.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
