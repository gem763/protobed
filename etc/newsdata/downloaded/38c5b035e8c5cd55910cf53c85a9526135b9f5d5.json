But now U.S. officials say those refugees should never have been blocked from boarding and would be welcomed stateside.\n\nIn footage captured by WSVN\u2019s Brian Entin at the ferry terminal on Sunday, a man is heard over an intercom instructing anyone without a U.S. visa to leave the ferry before it sailed from Freeport, Bahamas, to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\n\u201cAll passengers that don\u2019t have U.S. visas, please proceed to disembark,\u201d the voice said.\n\nThe announcement sparked chaos and confusion on board as passengers argued that visas were not needed for refugees escaping the devastation left by Hurricane Dorian. They were right \u2015 in comments to Miami\u2019s WSVN, Customs and Border Protection officials blamed the ferry company, Balearia, for \u201craising expectations\u201d that Bahamians without visas would be allowed to embark from the harbor in Freeport.\n\n\u201cI think [Balearia] raised their expectations without fulfilling the requirements,\u201d an officer said early Monday morning. CBP officials said they never demanded that passengers disembark the ferry leaving from Freeport and that they \u201cwould have been processed\u201d once they arrived in the U.S. had Balearia not kicked them off the boat, according to Newsweek.\n\nStill, the U.S. officials were noncommittal when asked whether these passengers would have been permitted to stay in the U.S. upon arrival.\n\nThe CBP website lists alternative forms of identification Bahamians can provide to apply for entry into the U.S. if they don\u2019t have a visa as long as they apply \u201cat one of the US Customs and Border Protection Pre-clearance Facilities located in Nassau or Freeport International Airports.\u201d\n\nIn a statement issued Sunday, CBP said the U.S. Embassy in Nassau is open for \u201cemergency visa appointments.\u201d The embassay is roughly 130 miles from the Freeport Harbor, where passengers expected to dock on Sunday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters Monday that CBP\u2019s policy regarding Bahamians seeking refuge is due to \u201cproblems\u201d in the country.\n\nShortly after CBP head Mark Morgan emphasizes that Bahamians will be let in on humanitarian grounds, Trump strikes a very different tone:\n\n\n\n\"The Bahamas has tremendous problems with people going to the Bahamas who weren't supposed to be there.\" \u2014 Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) September 9, 2019\n\nThe president\u2019s statements are akin to previous statements he's made regarding Black and brown immigrants seeking aid in the United States.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, he falsely claimed Mexico was exploiting immigration laws to send rapists and drug dealers to the U.S. In 2018, Trump repeatedly claimed a caravan of South American refugees was coming to invade the United States.", "description": "Customs and Border Protection said passengers without visas should register at the U.S. Embassy in Nassau, more than 100 miles away.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d76cdcf3b00002a74d0c3f2.jpeg?cache=cznjjx05or&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
