She claimed the post was removed by the social media app because her left nipple was exposed in the shot.\n\nIn an act of protest, she posted the same image, only this time she edited in Momoa\u2019s face and chest to the snap. Because male nipples aren\u2019t against Instagram\u2019s guidelines, the post hasn\u2019t been removed.\n\nAMBER HEARD DENIES BURNING JOHNNY DEPP WITH CIGARETTE DURING FIGHT\n\n\u201cIn honor of IG\u2019s rigorous and equitable Community Guidelines against showing the Female nipple ..and since mine enjoyed the brief privilege that\u2019s afforded to my male counterparts.. I decided to pay homage by replacing it with a picture that DID meet IG\u2019s strict nudity guidelines and such careful gender policies,\u201d she captioned the photoshopped picture.\n\nThe star also shared the original version of each image on her Instagram Stories so that fans could compare them and sound off on Instagram\u2019s policy.\n\nHeard made sure to note in the comments that she doesn\u2019t mean to take a shot at her \u201cAquaman\u201d co-star.\n\nAMBER HEARD'S FRIEND DEFENDS JOHNNY DEPP IN COURT DOCS, SAYS HEARD WAS 'VERBALLY ABUSIVE' TOWARD ASSISTANT\n\n\u201cBTW, love you AquaHubbs ! Sorry to use your pecs to make a point!\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe duo is set to reprise their roles in an upcoming \"Aquaman\" sequel.\n\nInstagram has caught backlash from female celebrities in the past who have called out its rule allowing male nipples but not female nipples.\n\nPer its Community Guidelines: \u201cWe know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don\u2019t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHeard is hardly the first star to call out Instagram for its policy on female nipples. In May, Sarah Silverman tested the social media app with a topless photo in her bathroom mirror that had her breasts slightly obscured. Miley Cyrus previously caught heat for her support of the \u201cFree The Nipple\u201d campaign after posting a topless image in 2014. The following year, Chrissy Teigen took the social media app to task after several of her photos were removed.", "description": "Actress Amber Heard used her \u201cAquaman\u201d co-star, Jason Momoa, to make a point about Instagram\u2019s nipple censorship policy.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/amber-heard-reuters660.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
