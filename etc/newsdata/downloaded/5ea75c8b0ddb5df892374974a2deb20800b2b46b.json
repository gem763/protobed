king penguins to drive nature tourism", "language": "en", "text": "Stanley (Falkland Islands) (AFP) \u2013 Waddling up the beach in single file, their heads held high with an almost self-important demeanor, king penguins are a major draw in the Falkland Islands\u2019 tourism industry.\n\nTheir fluffy brown chicks are nearly fearless of humans, meaning tourists at Volunteer Point, a peninsula on East Falkland Island, might get almost close enough to touch one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the furthest location north in the world that you can see king penguins,\u201d said Tony Heathman, a former sheep farmer who has spent the last 16 years taking tour groups to Volunteer Point, where a thousand pairs of the islands\u2019 signature species go to breed.\n\n\u201cWe get lots and lots of people who\u2026 love to come here and get as close to the king penguins as they possibly can,\u201d the 70-year-old told AFP.\n\nKings are just one of five penguin species in the Falklands, alongside the wacky-looking rockhoppers which have yellow tassels sprouting from the side of their heads, gentoos, macaronis and the burrowing magellanics.\n\nThe Falklands have incredibly rich biodiversity, including more than 25 species of whales and dolphins, but it is the guaranteed ability to get up close with penguins that makes it a particularly enticing destination.\n\nTourism is a growing industry in the Falklands despite their remote location in the South Atlantic some 480 kilometers (300 miles) off Argentina and occasional political and economic hostility from Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 2018, there was a 6.3 percent increase in tourist arrivals and a 29.4 percent surge in tourist expenditure to almost \u00a38.8 million ($11.3 million).\n\n\u201cOne of the key attractions for us was the king penguins at Volunteer Point, so we saw plenty of those,\u201d said Flavia Tang, 29, from London, who came for a week with her partner.\n\nVolunteer Point is one of the islands\u2019 most popular destinations, accessible from the capital Stanley by a three-hour ride in a four-wheel drive vehicle, including 11 miles of bumpy, boggy, off-road track.\n\nThe peninsula is also home to gentoos and magellanic penguins \u2014 known locally as jackasses because of their braying-like call \u2014 as well as oystercatchers, South American terns and ruddy-headed geese.\n\n\u2013 Like a Hitchcock film \u2013\n\nAnother of the Falklands\u2019 stunning locations for wildlife watching is Kidney Island, where rockhoppers use their claws and beaks to help them get to the top of cliffs where they will mate.\n\nIn order to see the birds, visitors must trek a half hour through tall, three-meter (10-foot) tussac grass while avoiding ground bird nests.\n\nBut a bird called the sooty shearwater is what makes the island truly unique.\n\n\u201cKidney Island is home to 140,000 breeding pairs of sooty shearwaters that are just rafting off the coast here ready to come in,\u201d Denise Blake, the Falklands government\u2019s environmental officer, told AFP during a visit to the outlying island.\n\n\u201cSo as night falls you really see them swooping in over the heads a bit like the Hitchcock movie where all the birds start circling in: It\u2019s incredible for that.\u201d\n\nWhile many nature-lovers head to places such as Antarctica and South Georgia, an island in the South Atlantic, Sally Ellis, the manager at International Tours and Travel, feels the Falklands are a better option.\n\n\u201cAntarctica and South Georgia are nothing compared to the variety and accessibility of wildlife in the Falkland Islands and it costs about a quarter,\u201d she said, adding that there was nearly a \u201cguarantee\u201d to see whatever wildlife is desired.\n\nBeyond birds the endangered sei whale is found off the coast of the Falklands while the distinctive black and white Commerson\u2019s dolphins swim near Yorke Bay and Gypsy Cove.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Leap of faith\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn addition to nature watching, adventure tourism is also growing on the islands, where enterprising locals are branching into the industry.\n\nTom and Jane Chater recently launched a business offering helicopter trips and tours.\n\nThe married couple is hoping to attract some of the 60,000 people a year who arrive in the Falklands from cruise ships by offering the chance to explore the islands from their four-seater Robinson R-44 helicopter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very busy and exciting time for us,\u201d said Tom Chater, 43.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we thought about for a long time,\u201d added 46-year-old Jane. \u201cIt\u2019s a leap of faith but we\u2019re keen to see how it works out.\u201d", "description": "Stanley (Falkland Islands) (AFP)
