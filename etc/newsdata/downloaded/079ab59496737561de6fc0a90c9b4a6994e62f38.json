We have worked well together with Border Crossings being way down. Kevin now, after many years in Government, wants to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector\u2026.\n\n\u201cCongratulations Kevin, on a job well done,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI will be announcing the new Acting Secretary next week.

Kevin McAleenan (@DHSMcAleenan) October 12, 2019\n\nAs Breitbart News has chronicled for months, McAleenan had defied the Trump administration on multiple fronts, including most recently providing an interview to the Washington Post in which he attacked Trump\u2019s \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d policy at the southern border and said he refused to call border crossers \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d\n\nFor the structure at DHS, Breitbart News exclusively reported accounts in which administration sources said McAleenan had implemented a personnel agenda that sought to protect the bureaucratic allies of former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nIn a New York Times report last month, McAleenan was accused of telling federal immigration officials to ignore Trump\u2019s orders at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMcAleenan, in June, was accused of having leaked raids scheduled by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency in order to sabotage and stop the plan. The ICE raids would have arrested hundreds of illegal aliens who had already been ordered deported.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
