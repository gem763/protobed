Some Note a Double Standard.", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was greeted by a sea of protesters at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport on Wednesday. The protest, organized by the Nevada GOP, was intended to shame the 2020 presidential candidate for supporting the impeachment campaign against President Trump.\n\n\"Don\u2019t impeach!\u201d and \"Go home!\" the demonstrators shouted at her.\n\nNevadans greeted @ewarren in Reno and let them know exactly how they feel about the Democrats\u2019 despicable attempt to impeach @realDonaldTrump and undo the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nJoin us and FIGHT BACK. Tell the Left to Impeach THIS ?? https://t.co/clr2NQb5rW pic.twitter.com/Pa5NykDJwy \u2014 Nevada GOP (@NVGOP) October 2, 2019\n\nThe Reno airport authority quickly apologized to the Democratic frontrunner for the incident because, they explained, it violated their policy. Not only that, but the airport informed the senator that the airport's attorney is looking into the matter.\n\nThat announcement made some people scratch their heads and wonder where the airport's apology was last year when then-Republican Sen. Dean Heller faced his own unfriendly welcoming crew. In June 2018, the Nevada Democrats organized a group of protesters to jeer at Heller as he hauled in his luggage because he was fundraising with President Trump.\n\nThe airport's silence then and intervention now suggests a double standard, critics argue.\n\n.@RenoAirport didn\u2019t apologize to @DeanHeller when the Nevada Democrat Party organized protestors against him, but Nevadans protesting @ewarren gets crocodile tears and \u201can investigation\u201d?\n\n\n\nGive me a break.
