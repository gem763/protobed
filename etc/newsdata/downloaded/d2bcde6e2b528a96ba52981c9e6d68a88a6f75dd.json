New York magazine published a story about women who\u2019ve come forward to accuse powerful men and, as part of that story, a woman who hadn\u2019t come forward publicly before decided to tell her story about Franken.\n\n\u201cI was just out of college in my first job, working for U.S. senator Patty Murray,\u201d she told New York. Franken, then exploring a run for the Senate, was the guest speaker at Murray\u2019s annual Golden Tennis Shoes Awards (named for a dismissive description of Murray, early in her political career, as a mom in tennis shoes). The woman worked the photo line, and when it was her turn to be photographed with Franken, she said, \u201che puts his hand on my ass. He\u2019s telling the photographer, \u2018Take another one. I think I blinked. Take another one.\u2019 And I\u2019m just frozen. It\u2019s so violating. And then he gives me a little squeeze on my buttock, and I am bright red. I don\u2019t say anything at the time, but I felt deeply, deeply uncomfortable.\u201d A military veteran who is now a senior staffer at a major progressive organization, she is the ninth woman to accuse Franken of inappropriate conduct and the fourth to say Franken grabbed her butt. New York also spoke to three individuals in whom she had confided after the first Franken accusations emerged; she says that she did not tell anyone about the incident after it happened out of embarrassment.\n\nEver since Al Franken announced he would resign his seat in the Senate, there have been people wondering aloud if he was making a mistake. Actor Matt Damon argued that Franken\u2019s misbehavior was of a different quality than, say, Harvey Weinstein, which is true. Damon\u2019s point was that maybe Franken should be forgiven and rehabilitated rather than dumped. The regret over Franken\u2019s departure culminated in a piece at the New Yorker earlier this year in which Franken himself said he regretted his decision to resign:\n\nWhen I asked him if he truly regretted his decision to resign, he said, \u201cOh, yeah. Absolutely.\u201d He wishes that he had appeared before a Senate Ethics Committee hearing, as he had requested, allowing him to marshal facts that countered the narrative aired in the press.\n\nAs Allahpundit noted at the time, the New Yorker seemed to have a very different standard for accusations about Franken than for accusations about Brett Kavanaugh. Still, if the photo of Leeann Tweeden had been the only incident, Franken probably would have survived. But it wasn\u2019t the only incident, just the only one he claimed to be able to remember:\n\nFranken, meanwhile, sent a personal apology to Tweeden, which she read aloud on \u201cThe View.\u201d He wrote, \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse, and I understand why you could feel violated by that photo. I remember that rehearsal differently, but what\u2019s important is the impact it had on you\u2014and you felt violated by my actions, and for that I apologize.\u201d When Tweeden accepted the apology, and said that she wasn\u2019t asking him to resign from office, Franken thought that the worst was behind him. But Tweeden\u2019s charges were soon followed by seven additional allegations of groping or unwanted kisses. A pattern of misbehavior is often crucial to proving sexual misconduct. Franken told me, \u201cMy first instinct was \u2018This doesn\u2019t make any sense. This didn\u2019t happen.\u2019 But then, when they started adding up, I said, \u2018Well, maybe I\u2019m doing something I\u2019m not aware of.\u2019 \u201d He added, \u201cBut this was out of the blue for me.\u201d\u2026 To Franken\u2019s dismay, he had no memory of any of the alleged accusers except Tweeden. He had met the seven women long ago, mostly in fleeting interactions in crowded venues, posing for photographs with them. Only two incidents were alleged to have happened after Franken was elected to the Senate. A woman named Lindsay Menz told CNN that, at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010, her husband had taken a photograph of her with Franken, and that Franken had grabbed her bottom while posing. She said that the episode had lasted three to four seconds, and that Franken\u2019s hand had been \u201cwrapped tightly around my butt cheek.\u201d (Menz didn\u2019t respond to requests for an interview.)\n\nPresumably, Franken won\u2019t remember his behavior toward this woman either, but the fact that accusers are still coming out of the woodwork two years later ought to convince the doubters this wasn\u2019t a one-time thing. It seems like more of a routine.\n\nOne of the arguments Matt Damon made in Franken\u2019s defense was that Franken\u2019s behavior always seemed to happen when the camera was on him while Weinstein\u2019s would only happen in the shadows. \u201cWhen you see Al Franken taking a picture putting his hands on that woman\u2019s flak jacket and mugging for the camera\u2026 that is just like a terrible joke, and it\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s wrong, and he shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d Damon said.\n\nBut maybe the reason Franken\u2019s groping always happened with a camera on him is that he felt the camera insulated him from accusations by providing him with exactly the ready-made defense Damon is using to defend him. In this latest accusations, Franken is literally telling the photographer to keep taking pictures while he\u2019s groping someone\u2019s rear end, as if he\u2019s trying to both prolong the situation and also emphasize the absurdity of it. He was a performer and a comedian, so he can always claim it was just for a laugh so long as the camera was on him. Whereas if he tried the same thing without the camera it would obviously be creepy.\n\nI don\u2019t think the presence of the camera, in Tweeden\u2019s case or any of the others, proves his innocence. I think it proves he\u2019s thinking about how and when he can get away with inappropriate behavior.", "description": "\"And then he gives me a little squeeze...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/franken-resigns.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
