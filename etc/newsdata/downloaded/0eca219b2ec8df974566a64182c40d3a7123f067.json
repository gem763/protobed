The last time they lost against Australia was at the 2015 World Cup when the fly-half Bernard Foley inspired a 33-13 win to dump England out of their own tournament.\n\nJapan hang on to reach Rugby World Cup last eight and send Scotland out Read more\n\nYoungs started at scrum-half that day and remembers England being shellshocked by Australia\u2019s ability to produce the unexpected but believes his side can turn the tables on Saturday in Oita.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t shown a huge amount in any of our games,\u201d Youngs said. \u201cAgainst USA and Tonga we kept it pretty low key. Against Argentina we had a bit more in the playbook but again didn\u2019t need to show our hand. We will make sure we have things we haven\u2019t had to use yet.\n\n\u201cAustralia are very clever in how they attack \u2013 they are smart, you think they are going to do one thing and they do something different. I have always found them challenging in that aspect.They always have a few things up their sleeve that you don\u2019t expect so it is important that we prep for that. But haven\u2019t had to show a huge amount yet \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nYoungs has represented England against Australia more often than any other nation \u2013 Saturday will be his 16th appearance against the Wallabies including British & Irish Lions matches \u2013 and has a number of fond memories. While his first Test start ended in defeat in Perth, he scored a stunning try on his second in Sydney when England clinched a memorable 21-20 win.\n\n\u201cIt is always big whenever you play an Australian fixture,\u201d Youngs said. \u201cIt always has been. There is a great rivalry, not just in rugby but throughout with the Ashes. Whenever you play the Aussies you want to do it, especially if you are English and vice versa.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between the respective head coaches and former Randwick teammates adds to the rivalry and Michael Cheika has already stirred the pot by suggesting England \u201chave to win\u201d because they have played one match fewer and have spent the weekend back in Miyazaki, 700 miles south of Tokyo, out of harm\u2019s way from Typhoon Hagibis. \u201cIt would be bizarre [if we go out on Saturday],\u201d Youngs said. \u201cThe thing is, we\u2019ve had pre-season games too and they were tough games, so we\u2019ve had a good run of games. I certainly don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re undercooked. I think we\u2019re in exactly the right spot.\u201d\n\nYoung is one of four players in Jones\u2019s squad with experience of a World Cup knockout match, having played in the quarter-final defeat against France in 2011.\n\nThen France were in disarray, having lost to Tonga in their pool but the fact they beat England means Youngs will not read too much in his side\u2019s recent run of victories over Australia.\n\n\u201cThe psyche is from my experience of playing against teams when you\u2019ve always come up short, you almost get even more motivated to chuck everything at them. We have to just make sure that we keep level-headed about it and don\u2019t rely on what has happened before \u2013 thinking that will be enough, because it won\u2019t be.\u201d", "description": "The England scrum-half has said England are yet to show their hand and dismissed concerns they will be undercooked for the quarter-final", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ae51f28e29e4414b47edaff4fedf096b09a624c/0_0_4183_2511/master/4183.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=33a7c43170514e541618b6676243b6f6", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
