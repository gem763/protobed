As such, many tech fans knew to expect the facial recognition technology and dual-lens camera before it was announced.\n\nThe Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will come in a choice of three different colours: Just Black, Clearly White and a new Oh So Orange finish.\n\nThe new Oh So Orange finish is our favourite (Google)\n\nMORE: Apple iPhone 11 Pro: the Metro.co.uk review\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe on board facial recognition technology uses a motion-sensing radar called Moli that\u2019s looking to compete with Apple\u2019s FaceID system. Google is at pains to point out all the personal information stays on the phone and isn\u2019t transmitted to its servers. The company also says its technology can go further than what Apple offers.\n\nThe Pixel 4 has what Google calls \u2018Motion Sense\u2019 which allows people to swipe their hand in front of the screen and execute a command without actually touching it. So, hypothetically, you could skip music tracks while you cook dinner without having to smear your greasy fingers across the screen.\n\n\u2018Pixel 4 will be the first device with Soli, powering our new Motion Sense features to allow you to skip songs, snooze alarms, and silence phone calls, just by waving your hand,\u2019 Google explained.\n\n\u2018These capabilities are just the start, and just as Pixels get better over time, Motion Sense will evolve as well.\u2019\n\nPixels have always been known for their photographic ability and this latest model adds an extra lens for the first time. The standard 12-megapixel camera has been joined by a 16-megapixel telephoto one while the front-facing shooter remains the same 8-megapixel one from the Pixel 3.\n\nGoogle stole a march on Apple\u2019s Night Mode by announcing Night Sight (a camera mode that brightens darker pictures) for the Pixel 3 last year. Twelve months on and Google is pushing \u2018astrophotography\u2019 with a new mode on the Pixel 4 dedicated to capturing the night sky \u2013 whether or not you\u2019ve got the phone settled on a tripod.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of the Pixel 4\u2019s allure will be the software perks \u2013 the phones will come with Android 10 pre-installed and will be the first to receive security and software updates. Both devices also use cutting-edge Snapdragon 855 processors and have 6GB of RAM. There\u2019s a choice of either 64GB or 128GB of storage space depending on how much you want to spend.\n\nAlongside the new phones, Google also revealed an updated version of the Home Mini smart speaker. Like the company\u2019s other smart speakers, this now falls under the \u2018Nest\u2019 branding to fit in with other smart home gadgets like thermostats and smoke detectors.\n\nThe Nest Mini smart speaker now comes in \u2018Coral\u2019 to match the phone (Google)\n\nMORE: What is Google Stadia? \u2013 When is it out and how much will it cost?\n\nThe new Nest Home Mini (which costs \u00a349) has been given a few extra features \u2013 capacitive controls on the felt-covered surface and a couple of new LEDs to indicate volume controls. There\u2019s also a recessed hole in the back of it so you can wall mount it on a nail. And, naturally, the audio is louder and clearer than last year\u2019s model.\n\nThere was also an updated version of Google WiFi \u2013 the mesh networking system the tech giant first announced back in 2016. The look of the router and the beacons has been given an overhaul (they\u2019re now even more white and minimalist) and the company\u2019s Google Assistant has been added to the beacons, which can now double up as smart speakers in their own right.\n\nGoogle WiFi has been given an even more minimalist look \u2013 if that were possible (Google)\n\nFinally, Google also revealed a new laptop, the 13.3-inch Pixelbook Go. It boasts Intel processors and a choice of either 8GB or 16GB of RAM.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the previous Pixelbook, it will run Google\u2019s own ChromeOS and has the Google Assistant built in.\n\nThe bottom of the Pixelbook Go has a unique textured finish to avoid it slipping around while it\u2019s on your lap or a desk. It will come in two colours: Just Black and Not Pink.\n\nUK pricing starts at \u00a3669 for the Pixel 4 and \u00a3829 for the Pixel 4 XL and both will be available from October 24.
