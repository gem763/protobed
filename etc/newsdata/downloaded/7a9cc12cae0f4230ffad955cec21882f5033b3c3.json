Joshua Lott/Pool via REUTERS\n\nIn an appearance set to begin at 10 a.m. (EDT) before the Senate Commerce Committee, Muilenburg will acknowledge mistakes, according to written testimony released Monday.\n\n\u201cWe have learned and are still learning from these accidents, Mr. Chairman. We know we made mistakes and got some things wrong,\u201d the testimony reads.\n\nSenator Roger Wicker, the committee chairman, said he plans to address at Tuesday\u2019s hearing families of the crash victims: \u201cI promise to their loved ones that we will find out what went wrong and work to prevent future tragedies.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Muilenburg visited the Indonesian Embassy in Washington to meet with the ambassador and \u201cpay our respects to those lost aboard Lion Air flight 610 on the first anniversary of the accident,\u201d Boeing said in a statement.\n\nMuilenburg, who was stripped of his title as Boeing chairman by the board this month, will also testify before the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on Wednesday.\n\nMichael Stumo, the father of Samya Rose Stumo, who died in the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash in March, said the victims\u2019 families plan to hold up photos of the \u201cloved ones we lost\u201d to \u201cmake sure the focus is on that, rather than political or bureaucratic or engineering issues.\u201d\n\nHe questioned why Boeing is only now adding safeguards to a flight control system known as MCAS that investigators have linked to both crashes.\n\n\u201cWhen you knew the MCAS system was part of that Lion Air crash, why didn\u2019t you act to correct it immediately instead of still withholding information about it and blaming the pilots?\u201d Stumo said of Boeing.\n\nU.S. airlines have canceled flights into January and February because of the grounding, and the Federal Aviation Administration is not expected to approve the 737 MAX\u2019s ungrounding until December at the earliest.\n\nIn March, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the plane was grounded worldwide.\n\nIndonesian investigators reported on Friday that Boeing, acting without adequate oversight from U.S. regulators, failed to grasp risks in the design of cockpit software on the 737 MAX, sowing the seeds for the Oct. 29, 2018, Lion Air 610 crash, which also involved errors by airline workers and crew.\n\nMuilenburg added that \u201cregulators should approve the return of the MAX to the skies only after they have applied the most rigorous scrutiny, and are completely satisfied as to the plane\u2019s safety. The flying public deserves nothing less.\u201d", "description": "Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg will begin the first of two days of testimony Tuesday before U.S. lawmakers and will face tough questions on the crashes of two 737 MAX planes, which killed 346 people and sparked calls for reforms.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446162139&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0M3", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
