(Photo: Courtesy of Carrie Vittitoe)\n\nA high school dance in Middletown, Ky. descended into a dress code debacle as several female students were reportedly denied entry \u2014 and one \u201cfurious\u2019 mom says officials put teens at risk in the process.\n\nAs the Louisville Courier-Journal reports, Carrie Vittitoe is among several parents outraged by the alleged crackdown on dresses worn by female students to Eastern High School\u2019s homecoming dance last Saturday. In a blog post about the situation, the mom of three says officials outside the dance singled out female students and measured hemlines with a ruler. Those whose dresses were deemed unsuitable \u2014 falling shorter than two inches above the knee \u2014 were allegedly refused entry, even after they paid the entry fee \u2014 though Vittitoe and her 15-year-old daughter say the dress code was \u201carbitrary,\u201d with some girls escaping scrutiny despite wearing similar outfits.\n\nView photos Vittitoe says the girl in the short red dress on the left was denied entry because she was showing too much cleavage; the girl in green was allowed in. (Photo: Courtesy of Carrie Vittitoe) More\n\nIn a letter to the school posted on Vittitoe\u2019s blog, her teen daughter \u2014 whose name is being withheld for the sake of her privacy \u2014 told school administrators that she and her friends \u201cwere absolutely horrified, and felt embarrassed and violated\u201d after being subjected to the dress code crackdown.\n\n\u201cWe had just been told that covering our bodies was more important than having fun,\u201d the teen wrote.\n\nVittitoe tells Yahoo Lifestyle that her daughter was allowed into the dance, but decided to leave because the experience of being measured and criticized for her dress was too upsetting.\n\n\u201cThe administrator asked my daughter to pull her dress down closer to her knees,\u201d Vittitoe says. \u201cMy daughter complied. The administrator said, \u2018You barely made it.\u2019 At that point, my daughter burst into tears. She and her friends decided they were far too upset to actually attend the dance at this point.\u201d\n\nView photos Vittitoe says all of the girls pictured here were turned away. (Photo: Courtesy of Carrie Vittitoe) More\n\nBoth mother and daughter claim the dress code was not consistently enforced. Photos taken by other parents and shared with Vittitoe and Yahoo Lifestyle show various dresses that were allegedly banned from the dance, though they seem nearly identical to other dresses that made the cut. Vittitoe says the same thing happened at last year\u2019s homecoming dance.\n\n\u201cLast year, because my daughter was a freshman, I followed the dress code to the letter,\u201d she says, noting that finding a dress long enough for her 5\u20198\u201d daughter is a struggle. \u201cWhen I saw the dresses that Eastern allowed in last year at the homecoming dance, I was angry. I saved photos of girls from that homecoming dance so that if my daughter was ever not allowed in, I would have evidence for the EHS staff to say, \u2018Then why did these dresses get in at the 2018 dance?\u2019 Dress codes are easy to write but impossible to enforce consistently. This was the case this year, too. I have photos of girls whose dresses are the same length but one girl got in and another didn't.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing from her daughter, Vittitoe returned to the school to pick her up, bringing a sign reading \u201cDown With Sexist Dress Codes,\u201d according to her blog post. (Though the dress code debacle reportedly mostly involved female students, one boy was turned away for not wearing a tie, she says.) That\u2019s when she noticed several stranded teens who had been refused entry.", "description": "A \"furious\" mom says several girls were turned away and left stranded at the school.", "authors": ["Erin Donnelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RZr9PfIKylqs9WzkZd66.Q--~B/aD0xMjgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/10cb8e80-de4b-11e9-affd-0d725479e619", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
