The weather may be miserable, but fashion's looking on the bright side", "language": "en", "text": "When it comes to wardrobe classics, it doesn\u2019t get much more iconic than a trench coat. As a true fashion geek, I revel in its patriotic backstory and its nerdishly functional details \u2014 hello storm flaps to keep out driving rain.\n\nThanks to Burberry designer Riccardo Tisci, who joined the British brand last spring, the trench has had a fashion renaissance, with celebrities including Rihanna and Madonna wearing his updated versions. And now, the trench has gone rainbow-coloured. Designs in Crayola hues were all over the runways last month, from lipstick red at Coach in New York and blush pink at Moschino in Milan, to a chic powder-blue style at Junya Watanabe in Paris.\n\nJess Wood shared advice for embracing this season's brightly coloured trench coats trend, pictured: Coat, \u00a369, Topshop; jumper, \u00a376, John Lewis; trousers, \u00a3130, Jigsaw; shoes, \u00a3245, Russell & Bromley\n\nCoat, \u00a339.99, H&M; jumper, \u00a3150, Jigsaw; skirt, \u00a339.50, M&S; boots, \u00a3450, L.K.Bennett\n\nCoat, \u00a375, ASOS; jumper, \u00a389, M&S; dress, \u00a3189, Whistles; shoes, \u00a3275, The Fold\n\nBoth Burberry and Aquascutum, another British stalwart, profess to being its creator: Aquascutum\u2019s claim dates back to the 1850s, while Thomas Burberry invented the water-resistant fabric gabardine in 1879 and submitted a design for an Army officer\u2019s raincoat to the UK\u2019s War Office in 1901.\n\nIts crisp style is its secret; it\u2019s versatile and suits everyone. Of all my coats, the one I reach for time and again is what I call my \u2018trench with a twist\u2019. From Topshop, it\u2019s made of thick, camel cotton drill with a stiff belt at the waist. It has every bell and whistle in terms of storm flaps and buttons, plus a patent tortoiseshell collar. It\u2019s definitely more Belle de Jour than Inspector Clouseau.\n\nCoat, \u00a3525, AlexaChung at Net-a-Porter; trousers, \u00a390, and shoes, \u00a359, Jigsaw; beret, \u00a38.99, H&M\n\nCoat, \u00a375, ASOS; jumper, \u00a319.99, New Look; trousers, \u00a3140, and shoes, \u00a339, Jigsaw\n\nLuckily, we don\u2019t have to wait until spring for the colourful versions \u2014 they\u2019re in the High Street now. One word of warning, however: unlike classic camel styles, a paintbox-bright trench needs more outfit coordination.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling brave, try tonal colour-blocking: a baby pink trench with darker pinks underneath, say, or an apple-green style with shades of bottle green. Otherwise, tomato red or bright blue work over most colours and are perfect for brightening up grey, navy or black officewear.\n\nI\u2019ll be splashing out on a joyous banana yellow one from AlexaChung to wear with a mustard jumper and my dark denim jeans. Bring on the muddy puddles!\n\nCoat, \u00a389.99, Zara; jumper, \u00a3149, Baukjen; skirt, \u00a345, M&S; boots, \u00a3189, Ancarani at Yoox\n\nCoat, \u00a3147, and boots, \u00a3450, L.K.Bennett; jumper, \u00a319.99, Mango\n\nStyling: Emily Monckton", "description": "Brightly coloured trench coats have been spotted on runaways across the globe including Moschino in Milan and Coach in New\nYork.
