She noted:\n\n\u201cThey were just heightened and they got more attention because of the high-profile nature of the project and the fact that Facebook was involved. I think it would be a really dangerous thing, and frankly a dangerous precedent to start shutting down technology before it\u2019s built.\u201d\n\nHaun underscored her perspective that there are national security implications if the United States falls behind in terms of cryptocurrency development, pointing to plans to launch competitors to Libra by states such as China and Russia.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, China has been researching its digital currency project since 2014, with development work gaining speed in 2018. In August, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) revealed that its digital currency was almost ready to launch \u2014 significantly sooner than Libra.\n\nA top PBoC official has indicated that the currency\u2019s organizational structure is to some extent similar to that of Libra\u2019s and that Facebook\u2019s unveiled project had fed back into the currency\u2019s original design.\n\nFrom the U.S. DoJ to Andreessen Horowitz\n\nHaun, who formerly worked at the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division on terrorism, mafia and other criminal cases, came to crypto gradually. At first she was investigating the use of Bitcoin (BTC) to facilitate extortion and white collar crime during her time at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\n\nTaking the view that prosecutors\u2019 perception of Bitcoin was misguided \u2014 their position being \u201cakin to saying \u2018let\u2019s go prosecute cash,\u2019\u201d in her words \u2014 she established a task force for digital currency coordination in 2015 as a resource for prosecutors and agencies.\n\nUnder its aegis, she began hosting regular meetings and training seminars with the U.S. Treasury, IRS and other government agencies. She also began teaching a class on cryptocurrency at Stanford Law School where she graduated.\n\nAfter choosing to leave her role in the federal government, Haun\u2019s trajectory has led to her becoming the first female partner at major crypto VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, having meanwhile served on the board of Coinbase, where she first met Horowitz partner Chris Dixon.\n\nFacebooks\u2019s Libra partners waver\n\nRecently, payment processor PayPal has officially left the Libra Association, the governing body of Facebook\u2019s Libra digital currency.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Oct. 2, the impetus behind similar worries for Visa, Mastercard and Stripe was ensuring Libra did not harm their relationships with regulators.\n\nLibra has created controversy with lawmakers worldwide since its inception, with a common narrative revolving around the digital currency taking power over money away from governments.\n\nStripe subsequently denied it was considering a U-turn. Libra developers have also outlined a roadmap for progress, revealing that nodes were already testing communication with one another.", "description": "Ex-federal prosecutor and now Andreessen Horowitz partner Katie Haun argues that the United States blocking Facebook\u2019s Libra will have national security implica...", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMTE5NDlhYzUzMDhmOGMyNTU3MzVkZGRhN2YyZmI5MGYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
