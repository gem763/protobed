House flipping, seen as an easy way to make a killing in the U.S. real estate market, has practically become a national pastime. Driven by popular TV shows that take a home from purchase to renovation to resale in an hour or less, a record number of flippers are flipping, even as gross profits are flopping.\n\nIllustration by Rose Wong\n\nAccording to Attom Data Solutions\u2019 latest House Flipping report, 7.2% of U.S. home sales in the first quarter of 2019 were flipped\u2014the highest rate since the first quarter of 2010. But the average gross sales profit was only $60,000, down from $62,000 in the previous quarter, and the lowest since the first quarter of 2016.\n\nThe figures prove that house flipping isn\u2019t as simple as buying a property, fixing it up, and putting it back on the market at a higher price. The most successful flips\u2014the ones that make the highest profits\u2014take time, money, and extensive planning. But there are ways to make sure you don\u2019t lose money.\n\n\u201cMy clients are high-profile people. They have careers that are not in real estate, and they see house flipping as an investment that creates sizable profits,\u201d Hartoonian says, adding that fewer than half his clients are flippers. \u201cThis is not a primary income for these people.\u201d Hartoonian advises house flippers to choose properties in \u201cvibrant neighborhoods that have notable sales and notable residents\u201d because \u201clocation is instrumental in the exit strategy.\u201d\n\nThe type of renovation, he says, has a great impact on the resale. \u201cFlippers should avoid too much custom tailoring; there\u2019s a fine balance,\u201d he says, adding that the buyer of the flip \u201cshould have the opportunity to make it all their own by adding their own personal touch.\u201d\n\nA Nation of Flippers $60,000 Average gross home-sales profit in the first quarter of 2019. 7.2% Number of home sales in Q1 that were flipped. $260,000 The largest profit Kortney Wilson has made from a home sale.\n\nAs for profit, although there\u2019s no magic number, Hartoonian says that \u201cif you can clear 15%, plus or minus, that\u2019s positive because at the bigger sales prices, that could add up to $3 million.\u201d\n\nFor Kortney Wilson, the Nashville-based co-host of HGTV\u2019s Masters of Flip, which has aired since 2015, flipping houses \u201cis always about the numbers.\u201d And her numbers are high\u2014she and her co-host husband, Dave Wilson, have flipped 125 houses in the historic district of East Nashville and nearby.\n\nWilson says it isn\u2019t as easy as Masters of Flip makes it seem because \u201cwe take 100% of the risk as well as 100% of the reward.\u201d The couple\u2019s first flip, 15 years ago, was \u201ca means to an end,\u201d she says. \u201cOur rule used to be that we had to make $100,000. But now things are riskier, and we are doing it faster because of the show, so we made it $50,000. It still works for us.\u201d\n\nThe Wilsons generally pay $250,000 to $300,000 for a house, spend $250,000 to $300,000 on a three- to four-month renovation, and sell the property for $700,000 to $800,000. Their biggest profit was $260,000.\n\nWilson works with the same contractor for every project. \u201cI tell people to do due diligence when hiring a contractor and a real estate agent,\u201d she says, adding that although she\u2019s a real estate agent, she doesn\u2019t broker her own properties.\n\nEven though flipping is on the upswing, Jonathan Woloshin, head of Americas real estate investment strategy at UBS Global Wealth Management, advises caution to his clients. \u201cThere was a time, just following the downturn of 2008 and 2009, when it was more attractive from a risk-adjusted-return perspective. But with the substantial increase in national house prices over the past several years, it\u2019s more difficult to find bargains,\u201d he says. He adds that there\u2019s more competition from single-\u200bfamily rental companies and private-equity firms, while \u201ca proliferation of a new class of well-capitalized, data-driven industry players called iBuyers is further complicating the calculus.\u201d\n\nWoloshin warns clients that flipping residential properties is riskier than other kinds of real estate investing\u2014such as in commercial and multifamily properties\u2014because, among other things, there\u2019s no rental income, and pre-flip repairs can often cost substantially more than budgeted. He says that flippers should buy properties in strong markets and submarkets, \u201cthe ones where people are going, not the ones they are leaving.\u201d\n\nIn the time it takes to renovate a house for flipping, the market can change drastically, he says, adding that this struck home for him when he made two trips to Las Vegas two years apart.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, I turned on the TV in the hotel, and it was the flipping channel,\u201d he says. \u201cIn 2009, I stayed in the same hotel and when I turned on the TV, it was the foreclosure channel.\u201d", "description": "Experts offer advice on the best way to invest in property", "authors": ["Nancy A.
