Post-debate, rivals like Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden have kept up their attacks \u2014 the former said that Warren had been \u201cmore specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she\u2019s taken\u201d than her Medicare for All plan; the latter accused her and Bernie Sanders of trying to \u201ccon the American people\u201d into thinking a health-care overhaul would be easy. How risky is this kind of strategy for candidates who have previously chosen the high road?\n\nGabriel: Well they\u2019re coming at it from different places, so their approaches have different risks. Buttigieg, for one, is trying to become the young Biden alternative, but he\u2019s built up his image without going negative, and now he\u2019s betting this is the way to be taken super-seriously \u2014 and, crucially, that voters are ready for these \u201clet\u2019s get serious\u201d-style contrasts, and won\u2019t rebel at the negativity. (See my story this morning on this very topic!) Biden is trying to maintain his position, and probably feels like he doesn\u2019t have much of a choice but to draw these contrasts. Obviously neither Biden nor Buttigieg is missing the obvious fact that Sanders+Warren has more supporters, right now, than Buttigieg+Biden, which says something, but obviously not everything, about the shape of the electorate this cycle. But they\u2019ve both picked their lane.\n\nBen: Warren clearly does not want to answer the question about whether her plan will raise taxes on the middle class. Some have criticized journalists for repeatedly bringing it up, arguing that their framing is misleading. But given her waffling, she seems destined to be hit with it again and again. Why do you think she doesn\u2019t simply say, \u201cYes, taxes will go up, but the huge drop in health-care costs will make the tradeoff worth it,\u201d the way Bernie Sanders does? What\u2019s the political calculation there?\n\nGabriel: She\u2019s already been asked it again and again \u2026 immediately after the debate last night! It\u2019s probably the single question she\u2019s been asked most over the last few weeks. But she\u2019s clearly calculating that (a) she doesn\u2019t want a clip out there, either in the primary or the general, of her talking about raising middle-class taxes, and (b) that she\u2019s refused to answer this framing of the question for long enough that she\u2019s not going to cave now and deal with all the coverage of that. But you can also see in her response how frustrated she is with the framing. She\u2019s trying to make a specific point when she responds, not to dodge for dodging\u2019s sake.\n\nBen: Do you get the sense that this is viewed as an actual potential problem, or more as something journalists are obsessed with?\n\nGabriel: Depends on who\u2019s doing the viewing. There are definitely some candidates not named Elizabeth Warren who are worried about this \u2014 Buttigieg\u2019s team, for example, loves pointing to a recent Des Moines Register poll suggesting Medicare for All is a general-election problem for Democrats. But Warren\u2019s allies see this as little more than a gotcha that\u2019s captivated journalists until they find their next thing.\n\nBen: As many have noted, Joe Biden sort of faded into the background for large stretches of the night, as candidates went after Warren instead. He also announced last night that he had only $9 million in cash on hand, significantly less than his top-tier rivals. There\u2019s a definite narrative going on now that Biden\u2019s long-awaited self-implosion is happening, and that he\u2019s yesterday\u2019s news. But he still polls very well nationally, and quite well in early states. Are we seeing more of the disconnect between what pundits expect to happen and what\u2019s actually happening that we saw crop up earlier in this primary cycle, when his staying power came as a surprise to a lot of people?\n\nGabriel: I think this is a case where both can be true! He\u2019s clearly no longer the strong front-runner, but you\u2019d think by now that the pundit class would be a bit more careful about predicting doom for Biden. He\u2019s shown in the last few hours alone that he\u2019s going to turn up his contrasts a notch, clearly because he sees a problematic trend in his campaign. But he\u2019s still polling first in many surveys and second in others. Hardly time for a massive panic, though the fundraising is a real problem.\n\nOne of the reasons Biden\u2019s fundraising numbers are an issue, of course, is his reliance on big-dollar, in-person fundraisers rather than grassroots donations. He can\u2019t go back to his donors and ask for more money like other candidates, because his relatively small number of donors have largely already given the legal maximum.\n\nBen: Amy Klobuchar had a pretty strong debate, but is right now not on track to qualify for the next one, in November, thanks to weak poll numbers. Do you think her performance could single-handedly put her on track to at least stay in the race longer?\n\nGabriel: I think there\u2019s a reasonable case to be made that she did the most of any of the four onstage last night who still hadn\u2019t qualified for November\u2019s debate. She\u2019s clearly made a similar calculation to Buttigieg (see above), and got a ton of speaking time out of it. Obviously, we\u2019ll find out soon \u2026 and we\u2019ll see how many polls there even are between now and the deadline!\n\nBen: Bernie Sanders did very well, especially coming off his heart attack. And he announced that AOC will be endorsing him, which is something of a coup, since some people expected her to pick Elizabeth Warren. Do you think either of these things will meaningfully boost his campaign?\n\nGabriel: He\u2019s obviously at the center of attention again, and that\u2019s been a major concern for him, so in that sense he\u2019s already gotten a boost. We\u2019ll see whether he\u2019s able to stop his polling slide and start gaining new (or regaining old?) voters. But Sanders\u2019s team was thrilled with how last night went, for good reason.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg\u2019s attacks on Elizabeth Warren, and more fallout from Tuesday night\u2019s debate.", "authors": ["Gabriel Debenedetti", "Benjamin Hart"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/16/16-elizabeth-warren.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
