Streeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nKnown as the \"Home of Golf,\" the game in various forms has been played over the St. Andrews links since the 15th century.\n\nThe historic seaside and university town north east of Edinburgh on Fife's east coast is home to seven golf courses with the Old Course at its heart.\n\nThe venerable layout occupies a windswept triangle of dunes, hills and gorse bordered by the West Sands Beach to the east and sandwiched between the New Course (1895) and the Eden, with the Jubilee, Strathtyrum and Balgove also occupying the venerable links. The Castle Course is on a cliff top overlooking the town.\n\nThe Old Course begins from in front of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club clubhouse and winds out to the Eden Estuary before turning for home, with many blind shots over seas of gorse and fearsome pot bunkers with names like \"Hell\" and \"The Coffins,\" which require careful navigation.\n\nThe course features an iconic finishing stretch -- the \"Road Hole\" 17th and the 18th across the Swilcan Bridge back up into town.\n\nPlaying the Old Course is a bucket-list item for most golfers and a ballot , drawn 48 hours in advance, is the most common means of entry, although there are limited advance bookings.\n\n\"I fell in love with it the first day I played it. There's just no other golf course that is even remotely close,\" said 18-time major champion Jack Nicklaus.\n\nBest courses nearby: If the seven courses in town aren't enough, there is the If the seven courses in town aren't enough, there is the Fairmont St. Andrews just down the road, a hotel and spa with two modern courses -- the Torrance and the Kittocks -- in the traditional links style.\n\nKingsbarns\n\nKingsbarns is a sought-after track down the road from St Andrews.

David Cannon/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nOn an unspoiled strip of prime Ayrshire coastline on Scotland's western flank lies the jewel that is Turnberry, nowadays best known for being owned by US President Donald Trump.\n\nPOTUS bought the celebrated course in 2014 before he took office and signed off on a multi-million dollar revamp, including to the famous Edwardian-era Turnberry hotel.\n\nThe redesign of the showpiece Ailsa course includes bringing the iconic lighthouse more to the fore with a new ninth green near its base. The setting and the views out to the Ailsa Craig rock and the Isle of Arran are still sublime and the redesign gets rave reviews.\n\nBefore Trump rode into town, Turnberry was most famous as the venue for the fabled 1977 Open Championship which came down to a final-round shootout between Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson and was known as the \"Duel in the Sun.\"\n\nThe lavish resort hotel and spa was named Scottish Hotel of the Year at the 2018 Scottish Hotel Awards and the 2019 Scottish Hotel Awards.\n\nBest course nearby: Trump's son Trump's son Eric opened the new \"King Robert the Bruce\" course, a redesign of the old Kintyre course with the same sublime views.\n\nRelated content Going to Scotland? 8 things to know before your holiday\n\nCarnoustie\n\nCarnoustie is one of the most daunting challenges on the Open rotation. David Cannon/Getty Images\n\nThe Championship course is one of three layouts on the Carnoustie links which juts like a shark's tooth into the North Sea on Scotland's east coast.\n\nThe lengthy, heavily bunkered track is arguably the toughest on the Open Championship rotation, particularly when the wind blows.\n\nIt was known as \"Car-nasty\" during the 1999 Open because of its thick rough, narrow fairways and a potent spell of bad weather.\n\nThat year, Frenchman Jean van de Velde famously contemplated a shot out of a stream while leading on the final hole before Scotsman Paul Lawrie won a playoff.\n\nDown the road, the historic town of Dundee on the Firth of Tay estuary has plenty of life for all tastes.\n\nFrenchman Jean Van de Velde looks at his ball in the burn on the 18th hole during the 1999 British Open at Carnoustie.

David Cannon/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nTroon was founded in 1878 but took its current form 10 years later in the South Ayrshire town overlooking the Firth of Clyde on Scotland's west coast south of Glasgow.\n\nThe Old Course is a classic \"out-and-back\" links with a relatively gentle start and finish and a devilish middle section through spectacular linksland with views across to the Isle of Arran. Wind is its major defense -- the breeze in your face coming home presents a formidable challenge.\n\nRoyal Troon is famed for the \" Postage Stamp ,\" its infamous 123-yard par-three eighth hole, and \"Railway,\" the 11th which runs next to the train track with a blind drive over a sea of gorse.\n\nAwarded royal status in 1978 to honor its centenary, Troon has hosted several Open Championships.\n\nBest course nearby: , under the flight path of the airport, hosted the first Open Championship in 1860 and the next 11 until the tournament moved briefly to St. Andrews.

Golf has been played in the seaside town, north of Inverness, since 1616 but the current club has \"only\" been in existence since 1877.\n\nRoyal Dornoch hosts two courses -- the Championship and the Struie -- but it is the former track that draws in visitors from around the world.\n\nWinding along sinuous sandy shores and among the dunes behind, the fast-running course features humps, hollows, pot bunkers and gorse of a true links test, sandwiched between the sea and purple heather-clad mountains.\n\nFor whisky lovers, the Glenmorangie and Ardmore distilleries are open for visits, just over Dornoch Forth Bridge on the A9 south towards Inverness.\n\nBest course nearby: The Carnegie Links at ultra-luxe : The Carnegie Links at ultra-luxe Skibo Castle offers golf in spectacular setting on the banks of the Dornoch Firth.
