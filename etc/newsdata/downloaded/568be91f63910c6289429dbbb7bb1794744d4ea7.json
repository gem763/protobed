Last week\u2019s bullish increased snapped a 4-week streak of bullish reduction, and it\u2019s possible we may have seen a low for USD bullish net-exposure.\n\nDXY Large Speculative Positioning\n\nDXY: Whilst IMM data provides a broader view of the USD, it is not a tradable product, whereas DXY is. Whilst net-long exposure hit a 6-month high, and gross long exposure is at an 18-month high. However, as we also see gross-short exposure increase, we don\u2019t suspect this to be a sentiment extreme just yet and could lay the groundwork for a sustainable bullish move. Of course, a stronger USD would create a headache for the Fed (and no doubt catch Trump\u2019s attention).\n\nNZD Large Speculative Positioning\n\nNZD: Traders are their most bearish on the Kiwi dollar in 6 months. However, net-short positioning is approaching a historical extreme, and gross-short exposure is at a record high. It\u2019s possible we\u2019re approaching or have reached a sentiment extreme, and worth noting that prices have rallied over 2.6% since the low on the 3rd of September to suggest short covering is already underway, in light of improved trade sentiment.\n\nJPY Large Speculative Positioning\n\nJPY: We suspect the net-long positioning on the Japanese yen may have reached a peak. Traders reduced net-long exposure by -5.9k contracts, its first weekly decline in 6 weeks, although bears also reduced exposure by -2.6k contracts to show lighter volumes among large speculators. Whilst this is not an all-out bearish case, it does show a hesitancy for bulls to push higher. Moreover, improved relations between the US and China since the report as compiled makes it likely we\u2019ve seen further longs closed and shorts initiated. We wouldn\u2019t be too surprised to see JPY revert to net-short exposure over the coming week/s.\n\nLarge Speculative Positioning (As % Of Open Interest)\n\nAs of Tuesday 3rd September:\n\nGold bugs pushed net-long exposure to a 3-year high\n\nBearish exposure to copper hit a new record high\n\nPlatinum traders are their most bullish on the metal since Feb 2018\n\nNet-long exposure for palladium hit a 5-week high\n\nGold Net Exposure (Z Score)\n\nGold: The scene may finally be set for gold to correct. It\u2019s been sending warning signs for several weeks of possible over-extension, with exposure at multi-year highs and Z-scores remaining above +2 standard deviations. However, markets now rallying on reports of new US-China trade-talks set for October, demand for gold has fallen to send it -3.4% lower from its highs. Even before this development, we note that the long/short ratio had fallen from to 5.6 from 6.7 just two weeks ago, and the 1-year Z-score is now back below +2 SD for the first time in 3 months.\n\nPlatinum Large Speculative Positioning\n\nPlatinum: Gross long exposure shot up to an 18-month high last week, taking net-long exposure to its most bullish level since May. Prices are also at their highest level since March 2018, although resistance has been found at a long-term bearish trendline, which began in August 2011. Like gold, it could be due to a correction but, given the bullish breakout of long exposure, we suspect Platinum could be trading at new highs again over the coming month/s.\n\nRelated Analysis:\n\nWeek Ahead: Draghi\u2019s last ECB meeting and US inflation\n\nPrecious GOLD-en signs for bears\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
