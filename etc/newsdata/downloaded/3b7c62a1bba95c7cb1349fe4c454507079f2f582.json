Very few associated with the league have defended Morey and free speech, but on Tuesday night Shaquille O'Neal -- aka The Big Aristotle, The Diesel, Big Fella, whatever you want to call him -- spoke his mind on TNT's pre-game coverage.\n\nMorey, as a reminder, tweeted \"FIGHT FOR FREEDOM. STAND WITH HONG KONG.\"\n\nReminder that this was the extent of Daryl Morey's tweet pic.twitter.com/hmSw3M1TaL \u2014 Peter J.
