I think it\u2019s a fair statement to say that things were different then.\n\nRepresentations of Indigenous people \u2014 in comics, movies, television, books, the news \u2014 were problematic. They perpetuated harmful stereotypes which served to dehumanize Indigenous people and led to racist attitudes and behaviours. I wasn\u2019t immune to the impact. For a Cree youth, it shaped my self-perception. I felt \u201cless than\u201d because these representations made me feel devalued. But things are different now, right?\n\nHalloween is fast approaching and with it, ghouls, goblins, ghosts\u2026 and Pocahontas.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nI was at a hockey game recently. After the game, I found myself walking behind a young man wearing a Cleveland Indians cap. The hat was turned backwards, and Chief Wahoo was staring me right in the face. For those who aren\u2019t aware, Chief Wahoo is Cleveland\u2019s red-faced, toothy, feathered, black-haired mascot. Recently, Cleveland stopped putting Chief Wahoo onto the field with its players. However, it continues to be sold. And for every team that has stopped using a racist mascot (which are almost exclusively Indigenous in nature) or changed its racist name, there are far more that have not (see the NFL\u2019s Washington football team, a name I refuse to write). But this overt racism isn\u2019t exclusive to sports.\n\nHalloween is fast approaching and with it, ghouls, goblins, ghosts\u2026 and Pocahontas.\n\nPocahontas is a Disney character. What\u2019s the big deal?\n\nFirst off: this article is not intended as a guilt trip. Guilt doesn\u2019t do anybody any good, and I don\u2019t think people choose costumes, for themselves or their children, to be racist or offensive. The thing is, that doesn\u2019t make it not racist or offensive. Even those of us who aren't racist can still perpetuate racism by the choices we make.\n\nInterested in this topic? Read this mom's piece on why your kid's costume matters.\n\nSo, to answer \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d \u2014 I can confirm that it is, in fact, a big deal. Dressing up as another cultural group diminishes that cultural group to a caricature. And for youth, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, that can plant a seed that grows into something far worse down the road.\n\nI'd like to plant a different seed.\n\nWhat I'm talking about is appropriation. Like reconciliation, it\u2019s a bit of a buzzword, so let me break it down into something more manageable. Appropriation is the act of borrowing elements from one culture and removing all context and meaning, with the intent of using those elements for your own purpose or profit. For example, dressing a non-Indigenous child as a \u201cnative chieftain\u201d for Halloween, complete with a headdress, would be eliminating the context and meaning of the headdress, let alone a chief. This article isn\u2019t long enough to discuss the significance of a headdress, but suffice to say, it\u2019s not a prop. It means something.\n\nAnd Indigenous people are not the only victims of Halloween appropriation. October 31 is not so great for the black community or the trans community, to name two.\n\nAt its heart, it's about respect. And while the conversation we\u2019re having now might be a bit too difficult, a bit too complicated, to have with a child, I would argue that it\u2019s never too early to talk about respect. I\u2019ve visited enough kids across Canada to know that they get it. But if they're bought a costume, they\u2019re going to wear the costume. And if they wear the costume, they may start forming damaging perceptions. Because while kids get respect and empathy, they\u2019re also impressionable.\n\n\u201cSo if I dress up as a pirate, aren\u2019t I being offensive to pirates? Where does this political correctness end? It\u2019s like I\u2019m not allowed to do or say anything anymore!\u201d\n\nI hear and see this pretty often. I guess it\u2019s not an awful question, if it\u2019s asked genuinely. After all, Pocahontas is a character in a Disney movie, right? Well, no, she\u2019s not. And dressing up as her is not the same as dressing up as, say, Jack Sparrow. To answer the question, I would suggest that another question is appropriate. Is the group being referenced \u2014 let's stick with pirates \u2014 a group that has been subjected to a history of oppression and discrimination? Because Indigenous people have.\n\nAnd Indigenous people are not the only victims of Halloween appropriation. October 31 is not so great for the black community or the trans community, to name two. They, and others, have encountered historical oppression as well, and should also not have to see themselves as a costume. They should not have to feel dehumanized, as though they are on the same level as a unicorn or a ghost or a zombie.\n\nRead more from David Robertson: I Think All Canadians Have A Responsibility To Talk To Their Kids About MMIWG \u2014 Here\u2019s How\n\nThey, we, are human beings.\n\nThat\u2019s the crux of this argument, I think.\n\nLet\u2019s look at reconciliation. What is it, really? My father, a recognized elder, says that reconciliation is making the effort to see each other as human beings, not stereotypes. In the context of Halloween and appropriative costumes, that means a few things.\n\nI\u2019m not infallible. Far from it. ... I was looking through old pictures recently and saw a photograph of my oldest daughter when she was a toddler. From what I can tell, she had on an Indigenous costume. Not Pocahontas, but not a whole lot better.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s difficult to see one another on a human level when one dresses up as the other in a way that perpetuates stereotypes we need to start seeing through. Second, we need to talk with each other and learn about each other. How can I educate my children if I don't educate myself first? For example, all it takes is a Google search to find out why the headdresses I mentioned earlier are so important and should not be relegated to the designation of Halloween costume. The more we do this, the more we prevent marginalized people from existing outside of historically perpetuated stereotypes.\n\nI\u2019m not infallible. Far from it. I\u2019ve made mistakes with my five children. We don\u2019t do Halloween anymore for our own reasons, but we used to when there were two kids and life was less busy. I was looking through old pictures recently and saw a photograph of my oldest daughter when she was a toddler. From what I can tell, she had on an Indigenous costume. Not Pocahontas, but not a whole lot better.\n\nBack then, I was just beginning to educate myself about Indigenous people, about my father\u2019s life, about what it meant to be Indigenous for me. I grew up disconnected from my Indigeneity, and this is a journey I\u2019m still on.\n\nI\u2019ve had these conversations with my kids, I\u2019ve had these conversations with parents. I\u2019ve gone through the process of learning so that I, and hopefully others, can make better decisions. So that my kids grow up differently than I did because I\u2019ve planted a different kind of seed in them.\n\nBecause as much as things have changed, a lot has remained the same. And all this to say: this Halloween, maybe pick Elsa (or the pirate) over Pocahontas.", "description": "Dressing up as a cultural group diminishes that group to a caricature.
