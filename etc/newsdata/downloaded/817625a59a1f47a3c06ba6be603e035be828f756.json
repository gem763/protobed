Most banks fear being charged with money laundering if they work with people in the legal marijuana industry.\n\nWiseman\u2019s bank is one of few that accept merchants like her as customers.\n\n\u201cWe are charged very high fees because the business is so special, and we are just subject to their mercy,\u201d said Wiseman, who opened her dispensary last year.\n\nTransactions are carried out mainly in cash, and when the money is deposited it takes several days to show up in her account, making it difficult to pay bills and employees\u2019 wages.\n\nWiseman\u2019s debit card only works with online transfers of crypto currency. The bank will not give her a credit card, deeming her a risk. And the bank can shut down her account over the slightest suspicion that a transaction is illegal.\n\n\u2013 A small step ahead \u2013\n\nThis wariness on the part of the banks also affects organizations that are regularly or occasionally involved with the marijuana industry.\n\nJenn Michelle Pedini, head of development at NORML, one of the main organizations lobbying for legalization of marijuana, said she had problems with the government when she helped a marijuana vendor set up a company under a consulting firm that she operates.\n\nThe pot industry is indeed booming, generating more than $10 billion a year in revenue which could hit $56 billion by 2025, accord to pro-legalization lobbies.\n\nBut of the 11,000 banks and other lenders operating in the United States, only 700 work with people in the marijuana sector, according to Treasury Department figures.\n\nLast week the House of Representatives passed a bill designed to protect pot industry professionals and associated companies from running afoul of the federal government. It now goes to the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nSupporters of the SAFE Banking Act also say it reduces the risk of burglary and violent robbery in an industry where cash is king.\n\nCritics of the bill say it gives drug cartels easier and less-monitored access to the financial sector.\n\nTanner Daniel, vice president for congressional relations at the American Bankers Association (ABA), called the bill\u2019s passage \u201ca necessary incremental step forward.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Taxing pot revenue \u2013\n\n\u201cABA is not taking a stance on legalization. 99 percent of members state that clarification is needed on the state and federal level,\u201d Daniel said at a recent forum in Washington.\n\nDaniel added that 75 percent of ABA members have closed the accounts of customers potentially tied to the pot industry.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate tend to frown on use of marijuana.\n\nMichael Correia, of marijuana lobbying group National Cannabis Industry Association, said Congress \u201cis not ready to debate the merits of legalization.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoliticians have been waiting for the polling and the public. It will be state, after state, after state, before the federal level,\u201d Correia said.\n\nThat is what Thiru Vignarajah, a former deputy attorney general in Maryland and candidate for mayor of Baltimore, wants to do \u2014 legalize pot in the city, and hope the state eventually follows suit.\n\nHe also proposes taxing pot sales with a city-backed and -regulated crypto currency and using that money to invest heavily in education.\n\nLegalization would also help in the fight against crime in Baltimore, one of the most violent cities in America, he said.\n\n\u201cThe murder rate is among the highest in the country. The drug war between gangs is fuelling the overwhelming majority of it,\u201d Vignarajah told AFP.\n\nHe admitted, however, that pot is just part of the drug problem and legalizing it is no panacea.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Most US banks shun people like Hope Wiseman, who runs a dispensary that sells marijuana for medical use.
