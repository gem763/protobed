I am the happiest man to run under two hours. I am here to inspire everyone that it can be done.\"\n\nIt was his second attempt at breaking the two-hour barrier, after missing out by 26 seconds at a similar event on the Formula One track in Monza, Italy, in May 2017.\n\nKipchoge, who took Olympic gold in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and has won 10 of his 11 marathons, holds the official world record of 2:01:39 since shattering the previous best mark by 78 seconds in Berlin last year.", "description": "Famous runner becomes the first person to run the marathon in less than two hours, clocking in at 1:59:40.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/12/406a80e5cae7427aa5949771492cc16b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
