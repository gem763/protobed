If you want the candidate with the most years in Washington, you\u2019ve got a clear choice. For everybody else, I just might be your person,\u201d Buttigieg said after an event at the University of Chicago, where he spoke with David Axelrod, former President Barack Obama\u2019s chief strategist. \u201cI think we saw that space opening up.\"\n\nKlobuchar, speaking aboard her bright green campaign bus in Iowa \u2014 and joking that she was happy to be able to pay to wrap her logo around it after her post-debate fundraising boomlet \u2014 said her scraps with Sanders and Warren showed a focus on the swing voters who will decide the 2020 election, particularly in the Midwest.\n\nKlobuchar chided Warren during the debate that \u201cthe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done.\u201d Earlier, Buttigieg had told the Massachusetts senator that her \u201csignature\u201d is \u201cto have a plan for everything, except\u201d health care.\n\nWarren and Sanders \u201csay, we are brave because these are our ideas, and you\u2019re not because you don\u2019t share our ideas,\u201d Klobuchar said in an interview. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ve been thinking about that a lot, and I said, no, I think it\u2019s actually brave to bring up that you should pay for things in our party. I think it\u2019s brave to acknowledge that we should bring in independents and moderate Republicans.\u201d\n\nIn Waterloo, Iowa, Klobuchar told the 100-person crowd at Single Speed Brewing that the campaign raised $1.5 million in the 36 hours following the debate, a \u201chuge amount of momentum,\u201d she said to cheers, \u201cand it gave me the chance to say a few more words than I got to in past debates from my perch up there on the side.\u201d\n\nStill, other 2020 candidates, like Kamala Harris and Julian Castro, bounced off of big moments in past debates but watched the attention fizzle out, without translating into lasting gains for their campaigns.\n\nThe new round of attention for both Midwesterners comes at a key moment: Klobuchar has yet to qualify for the November debate stage, while Buttigieg faced new questions about his campaign\u2019s attention to racial issues. And both of them still have significant ground to make up in the polls.\n\n\u201cIt sure feels like Buttgieg and Klobuchar have wind in their sails,\u201d said Jeff Link, an Iowa-based Democratic strategist. But it is \u201copen question is whether they have the organizational capacity to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nBased on money and staff footprint, Buttigieg is better positioned: He ended September with $23.4 million in his campaign account \u2014 third in the Democratic field \u2014 while Klobuchar has $3.7 million to spend. She\u2019s only reached 3 percent in one early-state poll, and she needs three more to qualify for the November debate. On the ground in Iowa, Buttigieg\u2019s staff is about double the size of Klobuchar\u2019s. Both candidates are currently airing TV ads in Iowa.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not been able to raise money online to the same extent as Buttigieg, which increases the pressure on debate performances and big moments,\u201d Link said. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to get coverage, to get attention if you\u2019re not on stage \u2026 You\u2019ve got to be there.\u201d\n\nBut Klobuchar, who rolled out a pair of Iowa state legislative endorsements this week, said that her campaign has been building, \u201cslowly, but surely,\u201d and preparing to seize on the right moment. A \u201cmoment in a debate [is] pretty short-lived,\u201d Klobuchar acknowledged. Those new endorsers \u201cdidn\u2019t just go, \u2018oh, we liked you in the debate!\u2019 We had those in hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s room for people to know who I am now,\u201d Klobuchar said. On Thursday, her campaign released a digital ad touting her track record of bipartisan successes.\n\nA former Biden backer in the crowd for Klobuchar\u2019s stop in Mason City Saturday agreed. Mary Lu Barnekow, a 79-year-old Democratic caucus-goer, said age was an important factor for her, and she \u201cwas for Biden\u201d before deciding his age was \u201ca concern.\u201d Buttigieg, meanwhile, is \u201ctoo young.\u201d\n\nInstead, Barnekow, clutching Klobuchar lawn signs and stickers, decided to caucus for Klobuchar after seeing her in person this weekend coming off last week\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cBiden is afraid to make waves, and since they have similar platforms, Amy will say what Biden is afraid to say,\u201d said Bert Lange, a 49-year-old voter from Garner, Iowa, who said he was supportive of the senator. \u201cI definitely felt like she did that in the debate.\u201d\n\nButtigieg echoed Klobuchar\u2019s commitment to building in-state infrastructure, calling his ground game \u201cthe biggest thing that we\u2019ve got to do\u201d to \u201cback up a message that is resonating,\u201d noting that his campaign boasts the most field offices in the state. He held a 900-person rally in Ames, Iowa last week.\n\nBut Buttigieg, who has continued to creep up in Iowa polling, also spent last week pushing back on criticism of tweets from 2018 showing him pledging support for Medicare for All, the policy he criticized vigorously in the debate.\n\nButtigieg defended his comments on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d saying: \u201cSomewhere along the line this year, politicians started saying that it\u2019s only Medicare for All if you eliminate all private coverage, which is why I now talk about my plan with the language of Medicare for all who want it.\u201d\n\nButtigieg also faced criticism for planning to attend a fundraiser co-sponsored by Steve Patton, a former Chicago city attorney who led the effort to block the release of video showing the shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager who was killed by police officers.\n\nButtigieg called the misstep \u201cfrustrating,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m going to figure out how it happened and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Buttigieg returned Patton\u2019s campaign contribution and removed him as a co-sponsor for the Chicago fundraiser.\n\nAxelrod, who interviewed Buttigieg on stage at the University of Chicago, advised the candidate to take more care. \u201cHire one more\u201d staffer, the Obama campaign veteran warned, and \u201cput them on vetting.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/41/b0/867fc1134ac9b54715d204bd97c5/191021-buttiegi-klobuchar-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
