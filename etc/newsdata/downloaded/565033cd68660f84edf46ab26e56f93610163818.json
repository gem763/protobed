Economists polled by Dow Jones expected an increase of 100,000 payrolls.\n\nMedium-sized businesses, those employing between 50 and 499 people, led the pace of hiring as their payrolls expanded by 64,000. Large businesses, those with at least 500 employees, added 44,000 jobs while small businesses saw jobs expansion of 17,000.\n\nPayrolls within the services sector increased by 138,000 this month, led by a 41,000 increase in the education and health services space. Trade, transportation and utilities businesses added another 32,000 payrolls.\n\nHowever, payrolls in goods-production businesses decreased by 13,000 in October. September payrolls were also revised down by 42,000 to 93,000. On Oct. 2, ADP and Moody's Analytics said September payrolls had risen by 135,000.\n\n\"Job growth has throttled way back over the past year,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The job slowdown is most pronounced at manufacturers and small companies. If hiring weakens any further, unemployment will begin to rise.\"\n\nWednesday's data will be used by investors as a preview for the government's October jobs report, which is set for release Friday at 8:30 a.m.\n\nADP and Moody's Analytics' report also comes ahead of a key Federal Reserve announcement later on Wednesday. The central bank is largely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points. That would be the third Fed rate cut of 2019.\n\nGet the market reaction here.\n\nThis story is developing.
