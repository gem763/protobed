Maverick's brother, Ryder, has had some difficulty breathing and didn't get to watch the game while getting healthy in the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\n''Maverick has been spending all day with the wife, and as soon as I get back, I can't wait to head down and see the other one,'' Reddick said. ''I can't wait to get a progress report.''\n\nReddick didn't sleep a wink on Wednesday night and missed Thursday's workout with the team to be with his family. But his wife handled baby duties on Thursday night so he could rest for his big day.\n\nThe outfielder said the last couple of days have been a ''rollercoaster of emotions,'' but that it's been one of the best times of his life.\n\n''I couldn't be happier that they're here and healthy,'' he said. ''It's definitely a game-changing experience. It's a different kind of love, a different step in our lives because I never thought I would be responsible for humans at any point in my life. It's definitely one of those feelings that you can't really prepare for. Here I am with two humans running around.''\n\n---\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports", "description": "After Josh Reddick walked to get Houston's big fifth inning started in a win over Tampa Bay in Game 1 of the AL Division Series on Friday, he couldn't wait to run out of Minute Maid Park to see his new twin boys.
