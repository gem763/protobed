What are we going to do with a house?\"\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nWhile showing some of the women round their house, Scarlett insisted she didn't have many things.\n\nBut one them said: \"I find it very strange for one person to have many things. Scarlett doesn't need that many things.\"\n\nWhile the women of the tribe are forced to walk 20 minutes to get water in the boiling heat, the Moffatts got it trucked in.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nStunned viewers took to Twitter after watching the new show through their fingers.\n\nOne viewer said: \"How on earth did @Channel4 think this was OK?? I'm totally shocked and appalled at #TheBritishTribeNextDoor\"\n\n\"This show makes me feel soooooooo uncomfortable the whole \"woooo look at us, we're CIVILISED\" vibe is very OFF,\" added another.\n\nA third had: \"This programme is making me f***ing fume. This is the most embarrassing, ridiculous, painful car crash TV ever. You should be f***ing ashamed of yourselves @Channel4 because this is disgusting.\"\n\n\"What an absolute disgrace. Who is responsible for this self indulgent s***. #C4 should hold their head in shame,\" said a fourth.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nScarlett refused to take off her off her clothes and go topless like the tribeswomen.\n\nThe former Gogglebox star got dressed in a swimsuit despite her new friends' pleas to embrace her body.\n\n\"All of the things you want I want to get rid of,\" admitted Scarlett as she started crying.\n\nShe was also terrified when they went to fetch water and came across a poisonous snake, despite her I'm A Celebrity experience.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nHowever, some viewers did enjoy the programme and did not find it offensive.\n\nThey claimed it gave a valuable insight into how the tribe lived and was fascinating to see the villagers discover stairs, mirrors and washing machines.\n\n\"Well! Only 10 mins into #TheBritishTribeNextdoor and already I am engrossed! What a quirky but great idea - and unexpectedly touching too. Genius telly! Ideal family to do it with as well, @ScarlettMoffatt,\" said one fan.\n\nAnother added: \"Who\u2019s watching #thebritishtribenextdoor ? Absolutely fascinating and actually powerfully touching\"\n\n\"Was genuinely ready to hate #thebritishtribenextdoor but actually enjoying it. If nothing else it\u2019s a lesson in unnecessary excess...,\" said a third.\n\nA fourth said: \"Just wow - this #thebritishtribenextdoor is great telly. Simple things like the Namibians thinking the concept of a second floor being mental is amazing!\"\n\n*The British Tribe Next Door airs Tuesdays on Channel 4 at 9.15pm", "description": "Furious viewers slammed Scarlett Moffatt and her family's new show - and even the tribesmen admitted they hated the concept", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Channel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20702136.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_British-Tribe-Next-Door.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
