Should they? Dare they? Did the congressional investigations already taking place qualify as an impeachment inquiry? Grappling with a decision so monumental, and politically risky, the Democratic Party threatened to tear itself apart.\n\nThen came last week\u2019s announcement by Speaker Nancy Pelosi that a formal impeachment investigation was moving forward in the House. Faster than you can say \u201cwhistle-blower,\u201d the dynamic flipped. Democrats united behind the message that Mr. Trump, in soliciting a foreign government\u2019s help to undermine one of his domestic political rivals, had left them no choice but to pursue such an inquiry. Republicans struggled to respond, with some of their arguments more creative \u2014 and coherent \u2014 than others. Among their efforts:\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham opted for a hard brushback: \u201cTo impeach any president over a phone call like this would be insane,\u201d he told CNN last Wednesday, referring to the July 25 conversation between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cThere is no there there,\u201d he insisted on Fox News hours later, warning that \u201cif this is an impeachable offense \u2014 this phone call \u2014 God help the next person to be president of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, tried a gentler version of this on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d saying he interpreted the call as \u201ctwo leaders having admiration, not intimidation.\u201d\n\nMike Pompeo, the secretary of state, turned the tables, accusing House Democrats of trying to \u201cintimidate, bully and treat improperly\u201d five State Department officials called to give depositions starting this week on the Ukraine affair.", "description": "G.O.P. leaders, confused and dazed by the Ukraine scandal, haven\u2019t come up with a coherent defense.
