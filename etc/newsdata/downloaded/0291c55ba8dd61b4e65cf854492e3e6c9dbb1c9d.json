That's By Design", "language": "en", "text": "TikTok is one of the fastest growing social media platforms on the planet, with more than 500 million active users. Only YouTube, Facebook and Instagram boast more. And yet, millions of people over the age of 15 have never heard of it.\n\nTikTok allows users to create short videos with music, filters and other features. But while it\u2019s now used globally by young people, many adult social media users have never heard of it. That\u2019s by design.\n\nIn 2016, we conducted an ethnographic study on social media use among families with preteen children in Melbourne. Although most young participants in the study were considered by their parents to be \u201ctoo young\u201d for social media, some had accounts on a new platform called Musical.ly \u2013 now known as TikTok.\n\nWe soon realised that the preteen demographic was central to Musical.ly\u2019s success \u2013 and to its evolution. The rapid increase of smartphone ownership among preteens presented a relatively uncaptured potential user base for social media.\n\nMany big players have made recent attempts to capture this particular audience. Snapchat\u2019s SnapKidz, YouTube Kids and most recently Facebook\u2019s Messenger Kids all focused on creating a \u201cchild-friendly\u201d version of the main app.\n\nThe creators of Musical.ly did their homework. They not only identified potential future users of the app, but also non-users that might hamper their success. In order to reach preteen audiences, social media apps need to get past the gatekeepers of preteen online engagement: the parents.\n\nBilling itself as a tool for creativity", "description": "TikTok is one of the fastest growing social media platforms on the planet, with more than 500 million active users.
