A source in his Downing Street office said there now needed be a fresh election.\n\n\u201cIf parliament\u2019s delay is agreed by Brussels, then the only way the country can move on is with an election,\u201d the source said.\n\nOn Tuesday, lawmakers did vote by 329 to 299 in favour of the second reading of the legislation for the Brexit deal - still no guarantee of success since the bill could be amended by lawmakers who want changes.\n\nThey then opposed by 322 to 308 votes Johnson\u2019s extremely tight timetable.\n\n\u201cI must express my disappointment that the House has yet again voted for delay,\u201d Johnson told parliament.\n\n\u201cI will speak to EU member states about their intentions, until they have reached a decision we will pause this legislation,\u201d Johnson said after the parliamentary votes. \u201cLet me be clear, our policy remains that we should not delay.\u201d\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seen at the House of Commons in London, Britain October 22, 2019. \u00a9UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/Handout via REUTERS\n\nThe pound GBP= fell 0.6% to $1.2881, off the 5-1/2 month highs hit earlier in the session on optimism about the deal.\n\nHOW LONG A DELAY?\n\nThe length of any extension could decide the course of Brexit: a long delay would allow time for an election and for opponents of the divorce to push for another referendum. A short delay might increase pressure on parliament to approve a deal.\n\nSenior EU officials said the 27 countries that would remain in the EU after Britain leaves would \u201ccertainly not\u201d react immediately. \u201cWe stay calm,\u201d one senior diplomat said.\n\nIrish PM Leo Varadkar welcomed the vote in favour of Johnson\u2019s legislation.\n\n\u201cWe will now await further developments from London and Brussels about next steps including timetable for the legislation and the need for an extension,\u201d Varadkar said.\n\nAhead of the vote, Johnson had warned parliament that if it forced a delay until January then he would abandon his attempt to ratify the deal and push for an election, under the slogan of \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d.\n\nIn his statement after the votes, Johnson did not mention an election. He would need the support of parliament to call one.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson reacts as MPs gesture at the House of Commons in London, Britain October 22, 2019. \u00a9UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/Handout via REUTERS\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called on Johnson to work with other parties to ensure a reasonable timetable to discuss the deal. Some in the Labour Party expect a short extension, with Brexit being resolved and then an election within months.\n\nBehind the daily Brexit combat in parliament, in the courts and at late-night EU summits, a much bigger game is being played over whether Brexit will happen at all.\n\nJohnson faces legislative booby traps at every juncture, but the opponents of Brexit are also deeply divided - one of the reasons their campaign to \u201cRemain\u201d failed in the 2016 vote.", "description": "EU leaders should delay Brexit after Prime Minister Boris Johnson paused legislation on his deal following a parliamentary defeat, EU Council President Donald Tusk said on Tuesday, as Britain spins towards a possible election to break the impasse.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444061333&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L21W", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
