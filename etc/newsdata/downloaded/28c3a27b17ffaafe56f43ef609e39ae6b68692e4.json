Cory Booker (D-N.J.) lobbed a fierce, post-debate attack against Democratic front-runner Joe Biden on Thursday evening, questioning the former vice president\u2019s ability to \u201ccarry the ball\u201d and saying other candidates had \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d if the former vice president would be up for a long fight for the White House.\n\nBooker\u2019s comments came during an interview with CNN after the third Democratic presidential debate in Houston. It was the first time the top 10 candidates were on the same stage, and it featured bouts of intense sparring between Biden and progressive challengers. At one point in the debate, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro delivered a sharp attack against the former vice president, suggesting that Biden\u2019s memory was failing him.\n\nCNN\u2019s Erin Burnett asked if it was a cheap shot against Biden, who is 76, but Booker said the attack was valid.\n\n\u201cI think that we are at a tough point right now because there are a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,\u201d the senator said. \u201cAnd I think that Castro has some legitimate concerns about, can he be someone in a long, grueling campaign that can get the ball over the line. And he has every right to call that out.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker on Juli\u00e1n Castro's jab at former VP Joe Biden's memory: \"Castro has some really legitimate concerns about, can he be someone in a long grueling campaign that can get the ball over the line? And he has every right to call that out.\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rMvlolVf0j \u2014 OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 13, 2019\n\nBooker, who has long used his debate appearances to promote unity among those on stage, added: \u201cI do think that tone and tenor is really important. We can respect [Vice] President Biden and disagree with him.\u2026 We shouldn\u2019t do things that at the end of this, when you demonize somebody and create bad blood, it\u2019s hard to unify afterwards.\u201d\n\nCastro\u2019s comment about Biden\u2019s memory didn\u2019t sit well with the former vice president\u2019s aides. Anita Dunn, an adviser to the Biden campaign, told reporters after the debate that the former Obama administration official \u201cclearly didn\u2019t learn from the first two debates that taking personal cheap shots at Vice President Biden actually doesn\u2019t work out that well.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview with Booker, Burnett pressed the senator from New Jersey on if he thought Biden was \u201ctoo old\u201d to be president.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m definitely not saying that,\u201d Booker replied. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to Joe Biden over the years and often felt like there were times that he is going on or meandering in his speech. Look, I want someone that can exit and can energize like we saw in \u201908 and \u201912. If I believed Joe Biden was that person, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here.\u201d", "description": "Former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro chided the former vice president during the debate in Houston, an attack Booker said came from \"legitimate concerns.\"", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7b156e3b0000c49fd20485.png?cache=vxzwf6sjzo&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
