The market share chart for the king of crypto has been showing signs of a pullback which of course is good news for the altcoins.\n\nBitcoin Reclaims $8k But Dominance Below 69%\n\nFollowing a Monday dip into the high $7,000 level BTC bounced back yesterday to reclaim $8k and top out just over $8,300. Yet again resistance has proved to be too strong here and Bitcoin fell back below $8,200 where it currently trades within its two week range bound channel.\n\nAccording to Tradingview.com BTC dominance has now dropped below 69% to a two month low. It is clear from the following chart that a pullback period has begun and Bitcoin\u2019s market share is likely to shrink further. The next support level in terms of dominance is 66%.\n\nThe failure of BTC bulls to break resistance has been good news for the altcoins, many of which are rallying well during Asian trading today.\n\nEthereum is currently out-performing its big brother with a 4% pump over the past 24 hours to top $180. ETH is still pretty weak in the grand scheme of things but recovery has to start somewhere and its market capitalization is almost back to $20 billion.\n\nChart guru Peter Brandt observed the ETH/BTC pair and how it is about to break out for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is unlikely to truly rally until it can retake the psychological $200 level without being dragged up by its big brother. The last time Bitcoin had dropped to $8k, in August 2018, ETH was priced at $400 so it still has a long way to go.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP has had a second strong day adding a further 3% to reach $0.275 but it too is way down from last year\u2019s prices and has been one of the worst performing altcoins this year.\n\nBitcoin Cash has retaken fourth spot from Tether with a 3% move to reach $230 again but like those above it, BCH is still pretty weak still.\n\nA 4% move for Litecoin wasn\u2019t enough for it to retake $60 and it has been very lackluster since the halving two months ago which halved its price in addition to the perceived supply.\n\nEOS is the top ten\u2019s top performer with 5% on the day to reach $3.20 but it is still down over 60% from its 2019 high. Binance Coin made a similar 4% move to get to $16 but the exchange based token is also down 60% from this year\u2019s peak.\n\nTotal market cap has increased by $8 billion since the weekend and it has been largely due to altcoins having a good start to the week. It could be the beginning of something bigger or just another minor blip in the ebb and flow of crypto markets.\n\nImage from Shutterstock", "description": "In a rare scene today all of the altcoins are in the green and many are outperforming Bitcoin as dominance drops lower.
