He said he would probably have a decision on who gets the post next week.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants it very badly, as you can imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people want the job. It\u2019s a great job.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s list of people being considered for the job is largely made up of reliable conservatives with solid ties to key Trump administration stalwarts, according to several sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nMike Pence\u2019s national security adviser, retired Army General Keith Kellogg, is part of a group that also includes the State Department\u2019s Iran envoy, Brian Hook, former deputy White House national security adviser Rick Waddell, and U.S. ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, among others, the sources said.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday ruled out asking Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to take on a dual role as national security adviser and said he has about 15 candidates for the post last held by John Bolton.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429214442&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B229", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
