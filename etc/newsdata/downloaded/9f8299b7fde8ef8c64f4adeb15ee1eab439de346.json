True to form for Garner, the resulting Instagram post is cute and funny. But putting a reminder out in the world for women to prioritize their annual screenings is also an incredibly important message, especially during October, which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\n\nGarner, 47, took to Instagram on Wednesday to show her 7-million-plus fans how easy this potentially life-saving step can be. \u201cEvery October I have a standing date,\u201d Garner wrote, adding, \u201cFor a mammogram. For me, having the appointment on the books makes it routine, like the dentist. I know it\u2019s scary, sisters, but just do it \u2014 the next best thing to an all clear is early detection. To everyone in the thick of the battle \u2014 respect and love to strength to you.\u201d\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nIn the video of her appointment, she changes into a hospital top, doodles on her paperwork, lets the machine do its thing and then finishes it up with a happy dance when she gets the A-OK from her doctor.\n\nThe video is already drawing praise from Garner\u2019s fans and famous friends. \u201cYou are a g darn treasure,\u201d wrote Olivia Wilde. Rachel Zoe, who has a family history of the disease, weighed in as well. \u201cI do the same twice a year @jennifer.garner and I love you even more for this post on behalf of myself and my sister and my mom,\u201d she commented.\n\nIn sharing her annual mammogram, Garner also shared an excellent hack we can all borrow. The actress schedules her annual appointment for October every year, without fail. And what a great way to remember to get it on the books, right? We\u2019re taking Garner\u2019s cue and taking Breast Cancer Awareness Month to heart by making it the month of the mammogram. And while we\u2019re at it, we\u2019re going to start scheduling our annual pap tests for January, during Cervical Cancer Awareness Month.\n\nSo, thanks for the tip, Garner! And kudos for raising awareness on such an important women\u2019s health issue.\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
