If your hometown happens to be lacking in museums, however, Lego\u2019s new Dinosaur Fossils set puts a small collection of thunder lizard skeletons on your desk, no admission required.\n\nPhoto: Lego\n\nThe 910-piece set, which is another Lego Ideas fan creation put into production, includes three 1:32-scale replicas of Triceratops, Pteranodon, and Tyrannosaurus rex, with T. Rex measuring in at around 40cm long. All three are fully posable and each includes a display stand with a tiny plaque for creating your own exhibit, but you can also make these dinos stomp around your desk should you find yourself trapped and bored during a long conference call.\n\nPhoto: Lego\n\nIf you\u2019re having a hard time justifying the set\u2019s $99.99 price tag because of other adult fiscal responsibilities, Lego is including a tiny paleontologist minifigure, as well as a Lego sapiens skeleton figure (which could help explain the mysterious disappearance of that paleontologist\u2019s partner) so you can convince yourself you\u2019re training for a career in paleontology while enjoying your favourite childhood toy.\n\nYou can even tell yourself you\u2019re buying it for your daughter, son, niece, nephew, or younger cousin to help foster an interest in science, and then conveniently forget to give it to them on their birthday.
