AAP\n\nBefore he lost Warringah, a seat held by Liberal politicians for the preceding 50 years (and by conservative politicians for its entire existence before that), Tony Abbott spent 25 years in parliament representing the Liberals.\n\nThe ignominy of the last few aside, his fellow travellers are gathering on November 7 at the Miramere Gardens for the purpose of \"honouring Tony Abbott for his magnificent leadership and outstanding contribution to both Australia and the Liberal Party\".\n\nAlan Jones is MCing the event, which is selling fast and sure to draw a heavy contingent of Liberals from glory days past.\n\nTickets are $130 (paid to the NSW Liberals) for party members, and $175 for everyone else.
