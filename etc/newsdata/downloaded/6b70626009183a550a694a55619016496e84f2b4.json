The comments came just hours after French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire claimed that Libra was of significant danger to the sovereignty of States:\n\nIn these conditions, we cannot authorize the development of Libra on European soil\n\nDespite attempts of the French Minister to influence countries in the European region to stop Facebook, Perez is certain that the social media giant will be able to overcome the difficulties that it\u2019s currently facing.\n\nFurthermore, Perez assured people that Facebook did not intend to create new supplies of money via the token, however, he did draw a comparison to BlackRock saying:\n\nWe don\u2019t want to become a new BlackRock \u2026 That\u2019s why these concerns about the destabilizing effect our reserve currency could have on central banks\u2019 fiat currencies \u2014 which figure in our basket \u2014 seem unfounded to us \u2026 Facebook will resolve gov\u2019t worries\n\nPerez confirmed further details of Libra, saying the stablecoin would be tied to a selection of major currencies, which did not include the Chinese yuan. One thing Perez was certain of was the capability of Facebook to resolve regulatory issues, putting people\u2019s concerns at ease while affirming that the company was working towards assuring that the stablecoin obtains all the regulatory approvals necessary to function.\n\nThe year we\u2019ve taken prior to release will allow us to iron out all the problems\n\nLuckily, France is not totally against cryptocurrencies. The country has recently decided not to tax crypto-to-crypto transactions.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cryptocoin.News Is The Central News Source For Information On Cryptocurrencies.
