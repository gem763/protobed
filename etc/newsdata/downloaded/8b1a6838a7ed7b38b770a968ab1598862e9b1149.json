The phone call was scheduled after Turkey announced it was planning to invade Syria, and hours after Erdogan reinforced his army units at the Syrian-Turkish border and issued his strongest threat to launch a military incursion, according to the National Security Council official to whom Newsweek spoke on condition of anonymity\u2026\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was definitely out-negotiated and only endorsed the troop withdraw to make it look like we are getting something\u2014but we are not getting something,\u201d the National Security Council source told Newsweek. \u201cThe U.S. national security has entered a state of increased danger for decades to come because the president has no spine and that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\u2026\n\nNewsweek granted the National Security Council official anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The source said it would not be surprising to see a Turkish incursion in the next 24 to 96 hours.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
