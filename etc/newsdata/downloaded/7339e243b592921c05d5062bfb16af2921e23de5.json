The images of her trip became world famous.\n\nLandmines continue to take thousands of lives in dozens of countries. So where in the world are they and what progress has been made?\n\nHow Harry is following his mother's lead\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPrincess Diana was known for her charity work, championing causes which weren't always in the public eye. She opened the UK's first HIV/Aids clinic in 1987, for example. That helped to change attitudes to the virus.\n\nRaising awareness of landmines was the princess's first major cause after divorcing the Prince of Wales in 1996.\n\nFor decades landmines had been widely used in conflict.\n\nMany unexploded devices left over from wars were killing and maiming people who stepped or triggered the bombs unintentionally.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nImages of her with amputees in Angola showed the destruction the devices were causing.\n\nDuring his trip, Prince Harry described landmines as \"an unhealed scar of war\".\n\nWhat are landmines and how many people do they kill and injure?\n\nLandmines are explosives. They have detonating systems that are triggered by contact and are usually buried just under the ground, or above it.\n\nThere are two main types: anti-personnel landmines, aimed at killing or injuring a person, and anti-tank mines, designed to destroy or incapacitate vehicles.\n\nMines were used in World War One, but their deployment proliferated from the 1960s onwards.\n\nCountries with highest number of casualties from mines in 2017\n\nThe random placement of mines became part of military strategy, creating hazardous environments for many people. About 60 countries and territories are still contaminated with anti-personnel mines.\n\nMore than 120,000 people were killed or injured by landmines between 1999-2017, according to research by Landmine Monitor.\n\nNearly half of the victims are children, with 84% being boys. Civilians make up 87% of casualties.\n\nWhich countries have the most landmines?\n\nAround the world, thousands of landmines remain.\n\nAngola is one of the most mined places in the world, because of the civil war there from 1975 to 2002.\n\nThe demining charity Halo says it is impossible to know exactly how many mines are in the country, but it has decommissioned almost 100,000 since 1994.\n\nThe Angolan mine authority says there are approximately 1,200 minefields.\n\nRemoving mines is a costly and dangerous task. At current rates, it would be likely to take hundreds of years to eradicate them completely around the world.\n\nOther territories with large areas covered in mines are Chad, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Turkey, Iraq, Yemen and Western Sahara.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Landmines: Why do they kill thousands every year?\n\nWhat is being done to prevent landmines killing more people?\n\nPrincess Diana's involvement in the anti-mine cause involved a call for a global ban on mines.\n\nIn 1997, just three months after her death, 122 countries signed the Ottawa Treaty, that prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines.\n\nCountries are also obliged to clear minefields within 10 years of signing up and to destroy stockpiles within four years.\n\nThere are now 164 countries bound by it - including the UK. However, the US, China, India and Russia - which is thought to have the largest stockpile - are among the 32 United Nations members that have not signed it.\n\nClearance of anti-personnel mines around the world\n\nMost states have not met their deadlines and mines are still being planted.\n\nThe continuing use of anti-personnel mines has been reported in Myanmar (formerly known as Burma), which has not signed up to the treaty.\n\nNon-government forces also use them, such as militants Boko Haram which have been placing improvised landmines in north-eastern Nigeria since 2014.", "description": "Prince Harry will highlight the fact that landmines continue to take thousands of lives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BDAF/production/_108995584_gettyimages-1171391278.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
