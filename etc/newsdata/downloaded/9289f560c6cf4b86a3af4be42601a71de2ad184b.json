The final hitman colluded with the target to fake his death, thus getting the whole lot caught and imprisoned. Thankfully not everyone in China is incompetent. President Xi Jinping did a great job of pumping Bitcoin this week, albeit perhaps unintentionally.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nFor a week which had some heart-stopping moments, things seem (touch wood) to be ending well for BTC. So how did it all pan out?\n\nThe beginning of the week saw what turned out to be a false start for bitcoin price, though it got us all excited at the time. BTC bounced back above $8,200, and suddenly perhaps McAfee\u2019s new $2 million predictions weren\u2019t so crazy.\n\nTightening technicals were signaling a big move, and PlanB confirmed that the stock-to-flow model still put us on track for a $100k bitcoin price in 2021.\n\nAnd then came the two-stage flash crash. First, we dipped back under $8k, wiping out the week\u2019s gains in one fell swoop. Then we took a $500 dollar hit down to $7500. Was this pattern of sideways trading, followed by big moves, down to day-traders pumping and dumping? Or could a drop in network velocity have caused the crash?\n\nWhatever the cause, time seemed to be running out for the (so far incredibly accurate) 4Chan \u2018wizard\u2019 prediction of a $16k bitcoin price by the end of October.\n\nAnd then President Xi bigged-up blockchain and price bigged-up with it. The gains came super fast, clocking up a 13% jump in just ten minutes. But by the end of the rally price had surged over 40% for its fourth-best day of all time.\n\nIt also lent itself nicely to a July prediction, which would now see us entering a bullish \u2018wildcard\u2019 rally. We can only wait and see. Maybe that 4Chan \u2018wizard\u2019 may be proven right yet?\n\nNews In Brief\n\nAt least somebody seemed to benefit from the midweek flash crash. Bakkt reported record trading volumes on its physically-backed futures offerings. Although some questioned whether Bitcoin futures could just be one big market manipulation scheme.\n\nAlso, Bakkt related, Mike Novogratz suggested that the company\u2019s new custody solution coming online could see prices go up to $10k\u2026 just before they did.\n\nGoogle (questionably) claimed that it had achieved \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019 with its Sycamore quantum computer. A back-of-an-envelope calculation suggested that it had the power to mine all the 3 million remaining bitcoin in 2 seconds.\n\nRussian authorities said they would ban Facebook if the US blocked the company\u2019s proposed Libra \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019.\n\nAnd Finally\u2026\n\nEarlier in the week, Bitcoinist lamented the continued radio silence of much-loved bitcoin-championing former serial-tweeter, Max Keiser. Whilst Max continues to host his regular Keiser Report on RT, it has now been over a month without a tweet for the previously-20-a-day man.\n\nBitcoinist\u2018s erstwhile impressive track record in luring industry figures back to social media has so far not succeeded with Max. We guess sometimes you just have to go cold turkey. But we\u2019ll be here waiting when he does return, and it\u2019ll be good to see him back.\n\nDid you reap the benefits of hodling in this latest bitcoin rally?
