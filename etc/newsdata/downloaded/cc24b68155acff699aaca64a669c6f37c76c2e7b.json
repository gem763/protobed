Not Halbussi, not Abdel Mahdi. We want to bring down the regime,\u201d the protester said.\n\nWomen were also seen in larger numbers, including a young nurse who said she was protesting \u201cfor the generation that\u2019s coming\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur generation is psychologically tired, but it\u2019s alright as long as this is for the next one,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2013 Sadr\u2019s sit-in \u2013\n\nThis week\u2019s protests are the sequel to six days of anti-government rallies that erupted on October 1 in outrage at corruption, unemployment and poor services.\n\nOil-rich Iraq is the OPEC oil cartel\u2019s second biggest producer, but one in five people live in poverty and youth unemployment stands at 25 percent, according to the World Bank.\n\nIn response to the rallies, Abdel Mahdi proposed a laundry list of reforms including hiring drives, increased pensions and promises to root out corruption.\n\nBut Iraqis hit the streets once again this week, and Abdel Mahdi now faces escalated pressure from parliament.\n\nThe body failed to reach quorum for a scheduled session on Saturday to discuss protester demands.\n\nLater on that evening, its largest bloc announced it would hold an open-ended sit-in to back the rallies.\n\nSaeroon \u2014 an alliance between populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Iraq\u2019s Communist Party \u2014 said it now considered itself part of the political opposition.\n\n\u201cThe sit-in is ongoing and open until protester demands are met and the reforms promised by the PM are enacted,\u201d Saeroon MP Salam al-Hadi told AFP from within parliament.\n\nThe move has put Abdel Mahdi under more pressure than ever, as Saeroon was one of the two main sponsors of his government.\n\nThe other was Fatah, the political arm of the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force which said it would continue to back the central government.\n\nThe one-time allies now find themselves on opposite sides of the protest movement.\n\n\u2013 Elite troops deploy \u2013\n\nThe Hashed was founded in 2014 to fight the Islamic State group but its factions have since been ordered to incorporate into the state security services.\n\nSeveral of their offices have been torched in recent days in southern Iraqi cities, hinting at a new violent phase.\n\nSeveral dozen protesters have died while storming or setting fire to the offices of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, the Badr Organisation and others, according to medics and police.\n\nTop Hashed commanders have threatened revenge, denouncing the attacks as sowing \u201cdiscord and chaos\u201d in the country.\n\nThe United Nations has said it fears \u201carmed spoilers\u201d could derail efforts at peaceful protests in Iraq and said it was \u201ctragic\u201d to see renewed violence in the country.\n\nSince October 1, at least 220 people have died in the capital and the south, according to official sources.\n\nA government probe found \u201cexcessive force\u201d was used to quell the first week of protests, and in a noticeable change, there have been no reports of live ammunition in Baghdad in recent days.\n\nMost of those killed since Thursday have been in the Shiite-majority south, but medics and protesters have reported trauma wounds from tear gas canisters unleashed into crowds in the capital.\n\nOn Sunday, security forces were positioned on the edges of Tahrir, while elite Counter-Terrorism Service troops and armoured vehicles were seen in surrounding districts.\n\nThe CTS said it had deployed its units to \u201cprotect vital infrastructure,\u201d and its forces were not seen in Tahrir.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 Iraqi students joined anti-government protests in Baghdad on Sunday, ramping up the street pressure on Prime Minister Adel Abdel", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/7df3f1_wave-anti-government-protests-is-gripping-iraqi-capital-iraq-students-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
