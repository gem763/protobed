REUTERS/David Mercado\n\nMorales has faced nearly a week of street demonstrations in major cities and growing international pressure to call a run-off vote with his closest rival Carlos Mesa in order to restore credibility to an election dogged by allegations of vote-rigging lodged by the opposition.\n\nMorales, Latin America\u2019s longest-serving president, is the lone survivor of a group of fiery leftist leaders who took office in the previous decade, most of whom have since been replaced by right-leaning governments.\n\nHe has overseen a rare period of economic and political stability in South America\u2019s poorest country. But doubts raised by official observers about the legitimacy of his first-round victory threaten to dog his 2020-2025 term.\n\nIn a speech in the region of Cochabamba, a bastion of rural support, Morales invited countries in the region that have called for him to hold a run-off vote - the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia - to take part in an audit of the official tally.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do an audit vote by vote,\u201d Morales said at a military event broadcast on state TV. \u201cI\u2019ll join (the audit). If there\u2019s fraud, the next day we\u2019ll convene a second-round\u201d election, he added in comments broadcast on state TV.\n\nBut he later said at a different event in Cochabamba that a key umbrella group of his social bases, Conalcam, has promised to send his supporters to choke off cities that have staged strikes against his re-election.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a plan,\u201d Morales said after meeting with the local Conalcam committee. \u201cIf they want strikes, no problem. We\u2019ll join them by sieging cities. Let\u2019s see if they can take it,\u201d Morales told cheering crowds of supporters.\n\nMorales\u2019 comments come as Mesa, a former president, said his supporters were forming a commission to pressure the international community to not recognize the election\u2019s results.\n\nBrazil, landlocked Bolivia\u2019s biggest trade partner, has already said it would not recognize Morales\u2019 win until the regional group Organization of American States (OAS) finishes an audit of the vote count that has not yet started.\n\nThe European Union and Washington-based OAS, both of whom sent observer missions to Bolivia, have also pushed Morales to convene a second-round vote.\n\nProtesters blocked roads in parts of the highland capital of La Paz on Saturday, chanting \u201cfraud\u201d and waving Bolivia\u2019s red-yellow-and-green flag as anti-government strikes continued in different cities in the South American country.\n\n\u2018SCANDALOUS FRAUD\u2019\n\nThe country\u2019s embattled electoral board, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) has denied any foul play and invited the OAS to audit the official tally. But it has not said whether it would accept the OAS\u2019 condition for the audit\u2019s conclusions to be legally-binding.\n\nPeru, governed by a centrist president, said it would take part in the audit at Bolivia\u2019s request and called for the process to be carried out respecting Bolivian laws.\n\nThe vote count by the TSE at 100% on Friday showed Morales had 47.08% of votes versus Mesa\u2019s 36.51% in a crowded race of nine candidates. That gave him the 10-point lead needed to face Mesa in a Dec. 15 second-round vote, when the opposition would likely rally behind Mesa to defeat Morales.\n\nThe TSE sparked an uproar after the election on Sunday when it halted publication of a quick vote count that showed Morales headed to a second-round with Mesa. When the quick count resumed after an outcry, it confirmed Morales\u2019 prediction on Sunday that he would pull off an outright win with the help of rural votes.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nMesa\u2019s campaign has also said that it has found 100,000 votes that should have been annulled due to irregularities but instead swung in Morales\u2019 favor.\n\n\u201cThis is a scandalous fraud never seen before. That\u2019s why the people are reacting,\u201d retiree Fredy Salinas, 67, said as he bought vegetables in a market in La Paz. \u201cThe people in the government are really shameless.\u201d\n\nMorales said his detractors were \u201cenvious\u201d of his achievements and accused the opposition, without providing evidence, of trying to stir up unrest to try to unseat him illegally. \u201cWith lies and tricks they\u2019re trying to instigate hatred and racism,\u201d he said.", "description": "Bolivian President Evo Morales on Saturday vowed to hold a run-off election if fraud is found in a vote count that gave him an outright win, but warned his rural base would siege cities if they keep protesting his disputed re-election to a fourth term.", "authors": ["Mitra Taj", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445256253&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P0KY", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
