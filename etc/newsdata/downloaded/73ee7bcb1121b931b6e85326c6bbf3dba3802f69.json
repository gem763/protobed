And he is paving the way for more foreign sales. His administration has loosened restrictions to allow more production to go abroad, 10 food industry entrepreneurs and executives told Reuters.\n\nIn addition to seafood, Venezuelan cheese, avocados, citrus, breakfast cereal and candy are finding international buyers.\n\nThese new foreign sales are tiny, with most companies billing less than $1 million per year. Venezuela remains almost entirely dependent on oil exports, which amounted to $29 billion last year.\n\nStill, the numbers signal a shift for a government that has long blamed the private sector for shortages of basic goods. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, for years accused food companies of hoarding and profiteering. Business leaders say empty shelves were the result of state policies such as price and currency controls and the nationalization of farms and factories.\n\nSince 2017, 140 Venezuelan businesses have begun exporting for the first time, half of them selling food products, according to data provided by Scottsdale, Arizona-based advisory firm Import Genius, which collects customs data for the import-export industry.\n\nSome veteran exporters, meanwhile, are leaning more heavily than ever on foreign sales as Venezuela's currency has collapsed. Fernando Villamizar, the head of a Venezuelan shrimp industry association, said the withering of consumer spending power at home has forced producers to look abroad for growth.\n\nOn a recent morning at a facility owned by a member of the trade group, dozens of workers in baggy smocks, plastic gloves and face masks cleaned shellfish and put them in boxes to be frozen. An order that day was bound for France. The plant also ships to Spain and Vietnam.\n\n\"We have to sell outside the country\" to survive, Villamizar said.\n\nVenezuelan companies sold $81 million worth of shrimp abroad last year, up from $54 million in 2016, making it the country's 4th-largest non-oil export, according to figures from the Venezuelan Association of Exporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEESE SPREAD CROSSES BORDERS\n\nMaduro's enthusiasm for non-oil exports comes as U.S. sanctions have hurt Venezuela's petroleum sales. To earn hard currency, his government is scrambling for alternatives.\n\nIn July, Maduro toured a factory outside Caracas that ships chocolate to Japan, television cameras in tow. He said the goal of these and other exports was to generate \"euros, rubles, yuan and cryptocurrencies.\"\n\nFood producers looking to export need to obtain a variety of government permits. Under Chavez, the state frequently denied those permissions, delayed them or never acted on them, the food industry entrepreneurs and executives told Reuters. They said Maduro's administration is now granting more permits, allowing them room to maneuver.\n\nThe Information Ministry did not respond to requests for comment on Maduro's exports strategy.\n\nThe government this year has also largely given up controlling prices, three of the food industry executives said. More goods have returned to Venezuelan stores.\n\nBut even with more products available, Venezuela's hyperinflation means few can afford to buy. Compared to five years ago, the daily calories now consumed by the average citizen have fallen 56% to 1,600 calories, according to Caracas-based Citizenry in Action, a nutrition-focused nonprofit. That is well below the 2,000 to 2,500 calories per day recommended by the World Health Organization. Millions depend on government food handouts and subsidized staples.\n\nLack of demand has spurred two large Venezuelan food companies - Empresas Polar and rival General de Alimentos Nisa CA, or Genica - to export products that until now had only been sold in Venezuela, said two people involved in those operations and a third with knowledge of them.\n\nThe two companies last year exported a combined $59,000 worth of merchandise, mainly to Argentina and Chile. Among the items headed abroad was a once-popular melted cheese spread made by Polar.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Shrimp farming is booming in this western Venezuelan city, but little of the shellfish is destined for tables in this malnourished nation.
