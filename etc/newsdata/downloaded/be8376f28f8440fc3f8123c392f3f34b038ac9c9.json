At least with me that is. As soon as people realise I\u2019m British, I am either benevolently pitied, become the butt of friendly jokes or am assumed to be an expert \u2013 until my interlocutors realise I don't know much more about what's going on than they do.\n\nAs I can never predict when a dinner, a work event or even a wedding might turn into what feels like an appearance on Question Time, reading up on the Irish backstop has now become part of my getting-ready routine.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

As Germany is run on clear rules and, more importantly, a written constitution (the so-called Grundgesetz \u201cBasic Law\u201d), no one here could fathom the lack of clarity in the UK. How on earth could a country that normally seems fairly orderly not know what is possible or what is not? I don\u2019t know guys! Pass.\n\nThere was a similar reaction when, back in March, John Bercow based a decision on a principle that could be traced back to 1604. Delving this far back into the archives was utterly incomprehensible to a country whose Basic Law was approved in 1949.\n\nIt seems this bewilderment is having some impact on people\u2019s perception of Britain. I recently went to buy a bike helmet and found the Union Jack design to be the cheapest. \u201cUK branding doesn\u2019t really sell right now,\u201d the shop assistant kindly informed me. Ouch. That\u2019s not to say I wasn\u2019t tempted \u2013 all I would have needed was some flags and a zip wire to complete the look.\n\nCurious to know if this Union Jack sentiment was felt elsewhere, I called an English shop in Munich \u2013 Pomeroy and Winterbottom \u2013 to find out how their clientele is dealing with the saga. They told me that Brexit is certainly a big talking point in the store, but that loyalty to Queen and country remains.\n\nGiven that customers here are willing to pay a premium for a bar of Dairy Milk or a jar of Marmite, this makes sense. The greater concern is where to source a Christmas pudding in Munich should the impact of Brexit cause the shop to close.\n\nEarlier this week, I even heard Britain\u2019s political conundrum being thrown around at Oktoberfest. Someone who\u2019d announced they were going home was later spotted with a new litre of beer in their hand. Cue the \u201cDoing a Brexit\u201d jokes.\n\nOf course not everyone wants to talk about it. Some simply aren\u2019t interested and others don\u2019t have time. The latter group might just offer the word \u201cBrexit\u201d in response to my nationality, an initially refreshing alternative to the previously popular \u201cfish and chips\u201d or \u201cThe Beatles\u201d.\n\nI was always unsure about how to react to these words of recognition, but a high five has never felt more inappropriate.", "description": "On the day of the referendum result, I arrived at my desk in an advertising agency in Munich to find my boss unplugging my computer and telling me to go home.
