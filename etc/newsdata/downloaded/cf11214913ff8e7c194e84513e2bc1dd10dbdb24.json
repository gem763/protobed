But that wasn't near close enough to get the Browns back in the game.\n\nHightower's touchdown marked the first of three straight turnovers New England forced on three straight Cleveland offensive plays.\n\nOther measures of this defense's dominance:\n\n\u2014The D has scored 26 points this season, and of the 61 overall points New England has allowed, only 24 (28 counting extra points) have come with the defense on the field.\n\n\u2014If you only counted scoring plays when New England's offense was NOT on the field this season (the four defensive TDs, along with seven field goals, two special teams TDs and one safety), the Patriots would still be 4-3-1.\n\nIn case you missed it, here's some more of the good and bad from around the NFL in Week 8:\n\nKICKING AND SCREAMING: DeShaun Watson got kicked in the face . Jacoby Brissett was being wrapped up by none other than Von Miller.\n\nIt took more than that to stop those two quarterbacks.\n\nWatson threw the game-winning touchdown in Houston's 27-24 victory over Oakland after spinning out of the grasp of Raiders lineman Arden Key, who, in trying to figure out where the heck Watson went, whipped his legs around and bopped Watson in the face with his foot.\n\nEarlier in the day, Brissett got loose from Miller, who had him in his grasp near the Indy goal line, then threw a 34-yard strike to T.Y. Hilton that helped move the Colts within range of the winning field goal. Indy beat Denver 15-13.\n\nFLUSTERED FLACCO: Broncos fans have been looking for a little fire from their new quarterback, Joe Flacco. They got it Sunday.\n\nBrissett's late save might not have been possible had Flacco been given the chance to throw the ball on third-and-5 with the Broncos clinging to a 13-12 lead late. Instead, they ran the ball into the line for no gain, forcing Indy to use its last timeout.\n\nFlacco couldn't understand why the Broncos wouldn't go for the win there instead of forcing the defense to hold the Colts out of field goal range.\n\n\"We're a 2-6 football team, and it just feels like we're kind of afraid to lose the game,\" he said. \"What do we have to lose? Why can't we be aggressive in some of those situations? That's kind of how I feel about a lot of the game today.\"\n\nHAPPY HALLOWEEN: Jets QB Sam Darnold said he thought he was seeing ghosts in a 33-0 loss to New England a week ago. A week later, he definitely was.\n\nJacksonville fans were quick to pounce on Darnold's unfortunate quote.\n\nThe team mascot, Jaxson de Ville, wore a white sheet. A plane circled the stadium flying a banner stating that Jags quarterback \"Gardner Minshew ain't afraid of no ghost.\"\n\nAnd the celebratory music at the end of Jacksonville's 29-15 win, one that featured three interceptions from Darnold: \"Ghostbusters,\" of course.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "In Case You Missed It In NFL Week 8: Pats D finds end zone again, keeps other teams out", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bbb995625c8510e06c56a25c67a984779576ff4c/c=0-186-3553-2185/local/-/media/2019/10/28/USATODAY/usatsports/901f790851be4f03a7ef2f93e7f1a200.jpg?width=3200&height=1801&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
