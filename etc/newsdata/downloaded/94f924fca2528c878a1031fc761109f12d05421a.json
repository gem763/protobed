(Sept. 30) AP, AP\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 \"You're a female Bruce Wayne,\" says Jacob Kane to his daughter, Kate, \"but unlike him, you actually have a shot at making something of your life.\"\n\nOuch. Gotham City isn't too happy with the Dark Knight or his billionaire alter ego these days, but Kate doesn't know that she's any better.\n\nKate Kane (Ruby Rose), Bruce Wayne's cousin, is searching for her place in Gotham, in her family and in her relationships in CW's \"Batwoman,\" which premiered Sunday (8 EDT/PDT, CW).\n\nWhen Kate was a child, her mother and twin sister were killed in a crash when Batman was unable to rescue them, and Kate has been lost \u2014 and a tad bitter \u2014 ever since. While her father remarried, Kate was sent to military school to keep her safe. She was dishonorably discharged.\n\nDougray Scott as Jacob Kane and Ruby Rose as his daughter, Kate Kane, in the pilot episode of \"Batwoman\" on CW.

But \u2026Kate's calling is to be Batwoman, and Sophie's calling was to be a part of the Crows. So, they're both helping Gotham and saving Gotham.\"\n\nAs Kate Kane is not simply a hero, Alice is no mere villain. She's hiding a secret and out for revenge on the Crows. Skarsten said one well of inspiration she drew on in portraying Alice is Lucille Ball.\n\nRachel Skarsten plays Alice on The CW's \"Batwoman.\" (Photo: Jordon Nuttall/The CW)\n\n\"When I started thinking about Alice, I wanted there to be a bit of dramatics to her, a little bit of a rag doll,\" Skarsten said during an interview. \"Lucille Ball is my favorite actress of all time. That sort of physical comedy or physicality was not typical for women at the time. And she just mastered that.\"\n\nThis season will explore the back stories for Kate, Sophie and Alice and show what connects them, what drives them and if there's another Big Bad waiting in the shadows of Gotham.\n\nHow it fits in the 'Arrowverse'\n\nNo worries if you haven't delved into the full breadth of the Arrowverse \u2014 the DC Comics series on CW that includes \"Arrow,\" \"The Flash,\" \"Supergirl,\" \"Legends of Tomorrow,\" recently added \"Black Lightning\" and now \"Batwoman.\"\n\nWhile Ruby Rose's Batwoman was introduced in the \"Elseworlds\" crossover event (2018), this series is fairly standalone and can be understood and enjoyed independently.\n\nBut, there are frequently team-ups between the DC properties on CW, with the next beginning in December in the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths.\" crossover event.\n\nMore: CW's fall: 'Batwoman,' 'Nancy Drew' and a whole lot more superheroes\n\nNo word what role the characters of \"Batwoman\" will play in the \"Infinite Crisis\" crossover, but it will \"have major implications in Gotham,\" Skarsten told fans at Comic Con.\n\nWhat about Batman?\n\nIt isn't clear if we will ever see Batman in the \"Batwoman\" series, but for now there will be plenty of references and a few familiar faces. So far we have Luke Fox (Camrus Johnson), son of Lucius Fox, and villains Magpie and Hush have been confirmed to appear on the show.\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/06/batwoman-ruby-rose-arrowverse-cw-infinite-earths/3894232002/", "description": "Who will save Gotham with Batman gone?
