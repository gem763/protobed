He said it is the job of Congress to update the law, not the justice system.\n\nBut advocates for sexual minority groups argue that the rights of the LGBTQ community have advanced first and foremost through the court system in recent years, most notably with the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 2015 decision to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time for the administration just to back off,\u201d Karen Holmes, 62, who transitioned to a woman after military service, said outside the marble-columned court building.\n\nAmanda, 30, who did not want to give her last name, said discrimination in the workplace is a major problem.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s a really important moment for the court to show that equality doesn\u2019t just stay inside the household. It\u2019s part of our society.\u201d\n\nMax, 19, also among those gathered outside the court, said he felt there had been progress against LGBTQ discrimination during his childhood \u201cand now it feels like we\u2019re starting to inch backward.\u201d\n\nRia Tabacco Mar of the powerful American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that \u201cin many ways, this is more fundamental than what was at stake\u201d in the same-sex marriage case of 2015.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the ability to earn a living, the ability to support our families, the ability to secure a safe place to live.\u201d\n\nOnly 22 states forbid discrimination against sexual minorities in the workplace.\n\n\u2013 \u201cEnough is enough\u201d \u2013\n\nThe Supreme Court will start by hearing the cases of Donald Zarda and Gerald Lynn Bostock.\n\nThe former, a skydiving instructor from New York, was sacked after jokingly reassuring a female client whom he was strapping to himself for a jump that he was gay. He died in a base-jumping accident in 2014, but his family have pursued the case.\n\nThe second case is of a social worker from Georgia who was sacked shortly after joining a gay sports team.\n\nZarda\u2019s dismissal was overturned by a court while Bostock\u2019s was upheld, and the difference in interpretation of the law prompted the intervention by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe court\u2019s nine justices will then examine the case, for the first time in public, of a transgender person.\n\nBorn a boy 58 years ago, Aimee Stephens worked for a Detroit funeral home for six years before telling her employer she wanted to be issued a female uniform. Two weeks later, she was fired by her boss, Thomas Rost, who said: \u201cThis is not going to work.\u201d\n\nIn defending his decision, Rost cited his Christian values and the need to avoid upsetting customers in mourning.\n\nSince its decision on gay marriage, the court has swung to the right with Trump\u2019s appointment of two conservative judges, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nFor Tom Goldstein, a lawyer who has often argued cases at the Supreme Court, Stephens\u2019 case has probably come \u201ctoo early\u201d before the body, which is unlikely to accept a broader reading of the 1964 law.\n\n\u201cIn 20 years, I think it\u2019s going to be pretty inconceivable socially, that we will think that the discrimination against gays and lesbians and transgender individuals is legal,\u201d he said.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The top US court on Tuesday began hearing arguments on whether employers have the right to sack workers because they are gay or", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/e7feba_demonstrators-in-favor-lgbt-rights-rally-us-supreme-court-in-washington-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
