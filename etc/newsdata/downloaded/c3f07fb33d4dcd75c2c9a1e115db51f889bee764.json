First Class Elis Angel Barreto Ortiz and eleven civilians were killed in a Kabul suicide bombing \u2013 for which the Taliban claimed responsibility \u2013 President Trump said Monday that peace talks between the United States and Taliban leaders are dead.\n\nSo what comes next for war-ravaged Afghanistan and U.S. involvement in the war there that has raged for the past 18 years?\n\n\u201cThe entire Afghan policy is currently in upheaval. What happens next depends on whether Trump will listen to Secretary Pompeo, who still believes a deal with the Taliban is the right thing,\u201d Bill Roggio, Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and editor of the Long War Journal, told Fox News. \u201cOr the growing chorus, including among influential Trump supporters, who oppose a bad deal with the Taliban.\u201d\n\nRoggio surmised that if the president does follow the advice of his secretary of state, talks could resume in a couple weeks. If not, the military will likely withdraw a number of troops without any agreement in place.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, the US is under no obligation to make a deal with the Taliban to leave Afghanistan,\u201d he stressed.\n\nBut in sharp contrast to the calm that inking a deal with the hardline Islamist faction was supposed to bring, Trump also tweeted Monday that over the past four days, the United States has \"been hitting our enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years.\"\n\nHOW THE TALIBAN REMAINED DOMINANT IN AFGHANISTAN: TERRIFYING TACTICS AND AN ADVANCING WEAPONS ARSENAL\n\nFor the past twelve months, the U.S Special Envoy and former ambassador to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, had been hammering terms of an agreement in Doha, Qatar. Late last month \u2013 following nine intense rounds of talks \u2013 a deal reportedly reached its final stage, designed to bring an end to the U.S\u2019s protracted engagement in Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to news reports, the now sidelined accord was said to have stipulated the exit of 14,000 American forces through to the end of 2020. In exchange, the Taliban pledged that it would not allow the conflict-wracked nation to be a safe haven for terrorist groups that threatened the security of the U.S.\n\nBut the speed with which the fragile dialogue fell apart has caught experts and analysts by surprise.\n\n\u201cA little over a week ago, there was little opposition to the (peace) deal. Trump was right to halt it, it was a bad deal that absolves the Taliban\u2019s role in providing a safe haven for Al Qaeda prior to and after 9/11,\" Roggio said. \"It would have been a humiliating defeat for the United States.\u201d\n\nDespite the efforts to reach a diplomatic conclusion to the stalemated conflict, Taliban-inspired attacks have continued with jarring frequency in recent months.\n\n\u201cWith or without a large U.S. presence, the current civil war with the Taliban goes on. Kabul still controls vast internal security forces who can hold territory, and there is still foreign aid and logistical support coming in \u2013 China and India want a stable government in Afghanistan,\u201d noted Miguel Miranda, an expert analyst in military technology in Asia. \u201cThis means the Afghan government won\u2019t crumble overnight. But the Taliban can keep fighting, keep trying to capture cities and subvert local authorities. It\u2019s a sad state of affairs.\u201d\n\nMiranda suspects the talks will resume at some point \u2013 likely after next month\u2019s presidential elections in Afghanistan \u2013 with a deal centered on four conditions.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban will not harbor terrorist groups, a U.S/NATO exit from the country, national dialogue for peace and a permanent ceasefire and a \u2018normal\u2019 country,\u201d he conjectured.\n\nNonetheless, the negotiations have been fodder for criticism since they started, in large part because the Kabul government was not granted a seat at the table. The Taliban has maintained that the Ashraf Ghani leadership are not the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan and refused their participation.\n\nDefense Priorities Policy Director Benjamin H. Friedman does not anticipate the now frozen arrangement to change the calculus.\n\n\u201cThe United States will likely proceed with the initial withdrawal of forces regardless of the deal\u2019s status, but it\u2019s hard to say given the president\u2019s fickleness,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should proceed with a withdrawal with or without the Taliban\u2019s permission since that is what is in our best interest.\u201d\n\nAccording to a well-placed U.S. defense source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, a deal is not likely to be revived in the immediate future, in spite of the insistence of some U.S. officials that it isn\u2019t all over.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban will use this as propaganda, and many in the U.S. seem quite comfortable with the prospect of just sending in black ops when things pop up,\u201d the source noted. \u201cPeople are just tired of the whole situation and the president certainly doesn\u2019t want it to become a campaign issue. I think we are going back to small hits and less (nation) building.\u201d\n\nAFGHAN WOMEN FEAR RENEWED CHAPTER OF SHARIA LAW AND REGRESSION OF RIGHTS UNDER TALIBAN\u2019S THUMB\n\nThe view from Afghanistan is a mixture of both relief and concern, with many taken aback by Washington's secret plan to host the Taliban delegation in Camp David this week, within days of the anniversary of 9/11, before Trump's weekend announcement he was pulling the plug.\n\n\u201cThe news of the Camp David meeting was shocking, and an insult to our terrorism victims. We\u2019re thankful President Trump canceled it,\u201d said Ahmad Muslem Hayat, a former Afghan military attach\u00e9 in London. \u201cBut they will continue. The Taliban will try to increase its terror reign and kill more Afghan Army and U.S. troops.\u201d\n\nSanjar Sohail, the publisher of Kabul\u2019s Hasht e daily newspaper, concurred that the move to squash the secret meeting on American soil was the right one.\n\n\u201cThe entire negotiations were a mistake from the start. It provided recognition and legitimacy to the Taliban, and we were worried after the last round of talks ended that the U.S. was going to abandon us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be a ceasefire, the negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government.\u201d\n\nBut in the meantime, Afghans caught in the crossfire are bracing for an uptick in violence. And while the U.S. position going forward remains obscure, the Taliban hasn\u2019t minced words \u2013 cautioning that the suspension of talks \u201cwill harm America more than anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will damage its reputation, unmask its anti-peace policy to the world, even more, increase its loss of life and treasure and present its political interactions as erratic,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cSuch a reaction towards a single attack just before the signing of an agreement displays a lack of composure and experience.\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd at least for the near future, Afghanistan\u2019s bloodletting will continue.\n\n\u201cWe will accept nothing less than the complete end of occupation and allowing Afghans to decide their own fate,\u201d the Taliban added. \u201cAnd we shall continue our jihad for this great cause and maintain our strong belief in ultimate victory, Allah willing.\u201d", "description": "Days after U.S. Army Sgt.
