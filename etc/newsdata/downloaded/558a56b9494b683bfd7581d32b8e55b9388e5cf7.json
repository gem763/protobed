He also happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes, so as Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is terrific. Peter Parker\u2019s story took a dramatic turn in Far From Home and I could not be happier we will all be working together as we see where his journey goes,\u201d Pascal said. \u201cThis has been a winning partnership for the studios, the franchise and the fans and I\u2019m overjoyed it will continue.\u201d\n\nIn August, news broke that Marvel would be ending its deal with Sony on the Spider-Man franchise, thanks to a disagreement over co-financing. Sony has long held the film rights to Spider-Man and connected comics characters, but several years ago, the studio struck a deal with Marvel to allow Spidey to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Feige helping to produce Holland\u2019s solo Spider-Man films.\n\nHolland first suited up as Peter Parker in 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War and quickly became a fan favorite. This summer\u2019s Spider-Man: Far From Home became Sony\u2019s highest-grossing film of all time, earning more than $1.1 billion worldwide.\n\nAt Disney\u2019s D23 Expo in August, Holland broke his silence on the Disney-Sony rift and spoke to EW, reiterating that he was committed to keep playing Spider-Man no matter what.\n\n\u201cBasically, we\u2019ve made five great movies,\u201d he told EW at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s been five amazing years. I\u2019ve had the time of my life. Who knows what the future holds? But all I know is that I\u2019m going to continue playing Spider-Man and having the time of my life. It\u2019s going to be so fun, however we choose to do it. The future for Spider-Man will be different, but it will be equally as awesome and amazing, and we\u2019ll find new ways to make it even cooler.\u201d\n\nRelated content:", "description": "Spider-Man swings again: Marvel, Sony reach deal on next Tom Holland film", "authors": ["Devan Coggan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jTF_j2dDphevptPeZrLWIg--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/entertainment_weekly_785/189fb622eeba11fbfb6aa7613a718d11", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
