(FBC), the holding company for Flagstar Bank, FSB, today reported third quarter 2019 net income of $63 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2019 net income of $61 million, or $1.06 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, Flagstar reported net income of $41 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2019 and $49 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2018.\n\nThird Quarter 2019 Highlights:\n\n\"The third quarter was a landmark quarter for Flagstar,\" said Alessandro DiNello, president and chief executive officer of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. \"Across the board, our businesses produced solid results, with mortgage banking taking advantage of market opportunities and our community banking and servicing segments again delivering strong, consistent earnings. The quarter also marked a milestone as the consent order with the CFPB expired, officially closing the book on our legacy regulatory matters.\n\n\"Community banking once again showed excellent growth, with net interest income climbing $8 million, or 6 percent, on an increase in earning assets of $1.2 billion, or 7 percent. Helping fuel the net interest income growth was a 12 percent increase in commercial loans, led by the continued success of our warehouse business. Also contributing to the growth were solid performances from our commercial real estate and homebuilder finance segments. Importantly, we achieved this growth while holding net interest margin nearly flat, despite two rate cuts, demonstrating strong margin management and the flexibility of our balance sheet.\n\n\"Our mortgage team had a strong quarter, with gain on sale rising to $110 million, a 47 percent increase over second quarter 2019 and a 156 percent increase over third quarter 2018. As a result of our continued focus on price discipline, combined with efforts to optimize volume and margin, gain on sale margin increased 31 basis points to 120 basis points in the third quarter 2019. Fallout-adjusted locks increased to $9.2 billion. These results highlight the diligence of our mortgage team to provide value to our customers at returns that maximize revenue for the company.\n\n\"We ended the quarter servicing or subservicing nearly 994,000 loans. The significant growth in this business over the past two years is testament to the quality platform and one-stop shop we offer our clients, underpinned by our industry-leading oversight, monitoring and compliance framework. We also successfully closed the default servicing transaction and integrated the business, further strengthening our servicing offering.\"\n\n\"This quarter's results demonstrated the earnings potential of our unique business model. Looking forward, we are confident that our business is well positioned to continue to generate strong risk-adjusted returns and create significant value for our shareholders in a variety of environments.\"\n\nThe three months ended December 31, 2018, excludes $29 million of hedging gains reclassified from AOCI to net interest income in conjunction with the payment of long-term FHLB advances. See Non-GAAP Reconciliation for further information.\n\nNet Interest Income\n\nNet interest income increased $8 million, or 6 percent, to $146 million for the third quarter 2019 as compared to the second quarter 2019. The results reflect a 7 percent increase in average earning assets, fueled by 12 percent growth in commercial loans. Net interest margin remained stable, decreasing only 3 basis points despite two rate cuts in the quarter, to 3.05 percent for the third quarter 2019 as compared to the second quarter 2019.\n\nStory continues\n\nLoans held-for-investment averaged $11.7 billion for the third quarter 2019, increasing $1.1 billion from the prior quarter. During the third quarter 2019, average warehouse loans increased $511 million, or 26 percent, benefiting from growth in the overall mortgage market. We also had solid growth in our commercial real estate portfolio as average balances increased $200 million, or 8 percent. Average consumer loans increased $396 million, or 9 percent, driven evenly by loan growth in non-auto indirect, mortgage and HELOCs.\n\nAverage total deposits were $15.8 billion in the third quarter 2019, increasing $1.7 billion, or 12 percent, from the second quarter 2019. The increase primarily reflects $1.1 billion higher custodial deposits driven by refinance activity and $328 million higher wholesale deposits.\n\nProvision for Loan Losses\n\nThe provision for loan losses was $1 million for the third quarter 2019, as compared to $17 million for the second quarter 2019 reflecting strong asset quality, low delinquencies and no nonperforming commercial loans.\n\nNoninterest Income\n\nNoninterest income increased $3 million, or 2 percent, to $171 million in the third quarter 2019, as compared to $168 million for the second quarter 2019. Excluding the $25 million DOJ benefit in the second quarter, noninterest income rose $28 million, or 20 percent, primarily due to higher mortgage revenue.\n\nThird quarter 2019 net gain on loan sales increased $35 million, or 47 percent, to $110 million, versus $75 million in the second quarter 2019. The net gain on loan sale margin expanded 31 basis points to 1.20 percent for the third quarter 2019, as compared to 0.89 percent for the second quarter 2019. Fallout-adjusted locks increased 10 percent to $9.2 billion, primarily reflecting increased refinance activity due to the continuation of lower mortgage rates.\n\nThis increased refinance activity accelerated prepayments, creating a net loss on mortgage servicing rights (including hedging) of $2 million for the third quarter 2019, compared to a $5 million net return for the second quarter 2019.\n\nLoan fees and charges increased $5 million, or 21 percent, to $29 million for the third quarter 2019, as compared to $24 million for the second quarter 2019, driven by $621 million of higher mortgage loan closings.\n\nMortgage Metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange (% / bps)\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n2019 June 30,\n\n2019 March 31,\n\n2019 December 31,\n\n2018 September 30,\n\n2018 Seq Yr/Yr\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n\nFor the three months ended:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage rate lock commitments (fallout-\n\nadjusted) (1) $ 9,197\n\n$ 8,344\n\n$ 6,602\n\n$ 5,284\n\n$ 8,290\n\n10% 11% Net margin on mortgage rate lock\n\ncommitments (fallout-adjusted) (1) (2) 1.20 % 0.89 % 0.72 % 0.60 % 0.51 % 31 69 Net gain on loan sales $ 110\n\n$ 75\n\n$ 49\n\n$ 34\n\n$ 43\n\n47% 156% Net return on the mortgage servicing rights\n\n(MSR) $ (2)\n\n$ 5\n\n$ 6\n\n$ 10\n\n$ 13\n\nNM NM Gain on loan sales + net return on the MSR $ 108\n\n$ 80\n\n$ 55\n\n$ 44\n\n$ 56\n\n35% 93% At the end of the period:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoans serviced (number of accounts -\n\n000's) (3) 994\n\n983\n\n962\n\n851\n\n619\n\n1% 61% Capitalized value of MSRs 1.14 % 1.23 % 1.27 % 1.35 % 1.43 % (9) (29)\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Fallout-adjusted mortgage rate lock commitments are adjusted by a percentage of mortgage loans in the pipeline that are not expected to close\n\nbased on previous historical experience and the level of interest rates.

NM - Not meaningful\n\n\n\n\n\nNoninterest Expense\n\nNoninterest expense increased to $238 million for the third quarter 2019, as compared to $214 million for the second quarter 2019, primarily reflecting higher mortgage-related expenses driven by an increase in mortgage closings.\n\nThe Company's efficiency ratio was 75 percent for the third quarter 2019, as compared to the second quarter 2019 adjusted efficiency ratio of 76 percent. The results reflect positive operating leverage as total adjusted revenue increased 13 percent while expenses rose 11 percent during the third quarter of 2019.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe third quarter 2019 provision for income taxes totaled $15 million, compared to $14 million for the second quarter 2019. The effective tax rate was 18 percent for the third quarter 2019, compared to 19 percent for the second quarter 2019.\n\nAsset Quality\n\nCredit Quality Ratios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of/Three Months Ended Change (% / bps)\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n2019 June 30,\n\n2019 March 31,\n\n2019 December 31,\n\n2018 September 30,\n\n2018 Seq Yr/Yr\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n\nAllowance for loan loss to LHFI 0.9 % 0.9 % 1.3 % 1.4 % 1.5 % 0 (60) Charge-offs, net of recoveries $ 1\n\n$ 34\n\n$ 1\n\n$ 1\n\n$ 1\n\nN/M \u2014% Total nonperforming LHFI and TDRs $ 26\n\n$ 63\n\n$ 24\n\n$ 22\n\n$ 25\n\nN/M 4% Net charge-offs to LHFI ratio (annualized) 0.02 % 1.29 % 0.05 % 0.04 % 0.05 % N/M (3) Ratio of nonperforming LHFI and TDRs to LHFI 0.21 % 0.54 % 0.24 % 0.24 % 0.28 % (33) (7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN/M - Not meaningful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe allowance for loan losses was $110 million and covered 0.9 percent of loans held-for-investment at September 30, 2019, consistent with reserve and coverage ratios as of June 30, 2019.\n\nNet charge-offs in the third quarter 2019 were $1 million, or 2 basis points of LHFI, compared to $34 million, or 129 basis points in the prior quarter. The current period results reflect low net charge-offs, including a $1 million Live Well recovery. Charge-offs in the second quarter included the $30 million Live Well credit loss and $4 million in other net charge-offs primarily related to unsecured consumer credits acquired in the December branch acquisition.\n\nNonperforming loans were $26 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $63 million at June 30, 2019. Nonperforming loans at June 30, 2019 included the $37 million Live Well loan.
