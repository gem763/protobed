These elements were scattered across the universe in a kilonova -- similar to a supernova -- after the initial fireball.\n\nNow, astronomers have also detected strontium, a heavy element, that was freshly made in the aftermath of the collision. This discovery adds evidence suggesting that neutron star mergers can create heavy elements found throughout the universe.\n\nNeutron stars are the smallest in the universe, with a diameter comparable to the size of a city like Chicago or Atlanta. They are the leftover remnants of supernovae. But they are incredibly dense, with masses bigger than that of our sun. So think of the sun, compressed into a major city. Now, think of two of them violently crashing into each other.\n\nThe study detailing the discovery published Wednesday in the journal Nature\n\n\"By reanalysing the 2017 data from the merger, we have now identified the signature of one heavy element in this fireball, strontium, proving that the collision of neutron stars creates this element in the Universe,\" said Darach Watson, lead study author at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.\n\nRead More", "description": "Astronomers have detected strontium, an element used in fireworks, in the aftermath of a collision between neutron stars, suggesting such crashes create heavy elements found throughout the universe.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191023104018-neutron-star-strontium-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
