He did so just one week after then-Toronto Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan shared his similar battles with depression in an article by Doug Smith of the Toronto Star.\n\nMultiple players have come out since then, sharing similar stories.\n\nThough Love and DeRozan weren\u2019t the first in the NBA to highlight the issue \u2014 that honor goes to Royce White, who was essentially blackballed from the league for doing so years before \u2014 the duo have since tackled the issue head-on.\n\nOn Tuesday\u2019s episode, Love went into his decision to actually write the piece for The Players\u2019 Tribune about his struggles. Love said that a journalist, ESPN\u2019s Jackie MacMullan, actually started putting the pieces together around the All-Star break that season \u2014 something that really freaked him out.\n\nSo every time he was asked about it, he deflected.\n\nFinally, though, he realized that he needed to be the one to tell his story.\n\n\u201cI was deflecting because I didn\u2019t want anybody to know,\u201d Love said on The Shop. \u201cThere\u2019s such a stigma around it. But now, I have this saying: \u2018Only by admitting who you are do you get what you want.\u2019 So I played all my cards and just said, \u2018This is what you get.\u2019 But in that time, until you can admit what\u2019s really going on, you\u2019re in such a hole that you have blinders on. I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t want anybody else to tell my story.\u2019\u201d\n\nLove wasn\u2019t the only one to discuss mental health on the show Tuesday night.\n\nGronkowski detailed the stigma about being \u201cmentally tough\u201d in sports and inside the Patriots organization.\n\nWarning: This video contains language that is NSFW\n\nLittle peak into @RobGronkowski's mental toughness mentality on the next episode of The Shop coming tomorrow to @hbo! #TheShopHBO pic.twitter.com/70MpJGyB2L \u2014 UNINTERRUPTED (@uninterrupted) September 2, 2019\n\nHe also talked about when he learned that it was time to step away from the game.\n\nWarning: This video contains language that is NSFW\n\nGronk opens up, and he's not the only one.\n\n\n\nA new episode of #TheShopHBO premieres tonight at 11pm. pic.twitter.com/XgzLb1Xgqw \u2014 HBO (@HBO) September 3, 2019\n\n\u201cIn order to do something bigger in life, in order to get to a higher stage \u2026 I felt like I had to get away from the game and focus on my health,\u201d Gronkowski said. \u201cI lived like the typical party life. I was eating f---ing sh-t every second. I was just trying to put on weight. I was living that life, and then at the same time I was going out and playing f---ing football and running people over, getting run over.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Kevin Love detailed his decision to go public about his battles with mental health on Tuesday's episode of \"The Shop.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oP.aSyDHflX2uLs5J46ezQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ktheE_W143c2adPPcrm9fg--~B/aD0yMzk2O3c9MzU5NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/b06f1190-6b9c-11e9-8eff-395cf177ab73"}
