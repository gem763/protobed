Thick smoke rose from the Green Village, home to several foreign organizations and guesthouses, whose location has become a peril to nearby local residents as well.\n\n\u201cPeople were screaming and saying, \u2018My children are trapped in the rubble,\u2019\u201d one witness, Faiz Ahmad, said. A large crater was left in the street from a tractor packed with explosives. Five attackers were killed in the Monday night attack and some 400 foreigners rescued, Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said.\n\nSTR via Getty Images Afghan firefighters work at a parking lot near the site where a tractor packed with explosives exploded the night before at the Green Village in Kabul on September 3, 2019. - A massive blast in a residential area of Kabul killed at least 16 people, officials said September 3, following yet another Taliban attack that came as the insurgents and Washington try to finalise a withdrawal deal.

The accord would include a troop withdrawal that the Taliban already portray as their victory.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told The Associated Press that \u201cwe understand that peace talks are going on ... but they must also understand that we are not weak and if we enter into talks ... we enter from a strong position.\u201d\n\nHe said the attack was a response to raids by U.S. and Afghan forces on civilians across the country. While he acknowledged there should be less harm to civilians, he said they shouldn\u2019t live near such an important foreign compound.\n\nQuestions are growing among some in Washington about the dangers of trusting the Taliban to make peace. On Tuesday, several former U.S. ambassadors to Afghanistan warned in a joint statement published by the Atlantic Council that \u201cit is not clear whether peace is possible,\u201d saying the Taliban have \u201cmade it clear that the war will go on against the Afghan government.\u201d\n\nWAKIL KOHSAR via Getty Images A wounded man lies in bed after being treated at Wazir Akbar Khan hospital after a massive explosion the night before in Kabul on September 3, 2019. - A massive explosion rocked central Kabul late on September 2, killing at least five people in a Taliban-claimed attack near an international complex while the US special envoy leading talks with the insurgents visited the Afghan capital.

Civil war could follow and give al-Qaida and the local Islamic State affiliate space to grow, they said: \u201cAll of this could prove catastrophic for U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nThe attack occurred just hours after U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad briefed the Afghan government on an agreement \u201cin principle\u201d with the Taliban that would see 5,000 U.S. troops withdraw from five bases in the country within 135 days of a final deal on ending nearly 18 years of fighting. Between 14,000 and 13,000 troops are currently in the country.\n\nHours before Monday\u2019s attack, Khalilzad showed a draft deal to the Afghan president after declaring that they are \u201cat the threshold of an agreement\u201d following the end of the ninth round of U.S.-Taliban talks in Qatar.\n\nKhalilzad has not commented publicly since the blast, which rocked Kabul as many residents watched him speak in a nationally televised interview about the deal and Afghanistan\u2019s future.\n\nWAKIL KOHSAR via Getty Images Relatives of Afghan victims wait outside the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital after a massive explosion the night before in Kabul on September 3, 2019. - A massive explosion rocked central Kabul late on September 2, killing at least five people in a Taliban-claimed attack near an international complex while the US special envoy leading talks with the insurgents visited the Afghan capital.

Can they be trusted!!??\u201d presidential spokesman Sediq Seddiqi tweeted.\n\nThe Taliban want all of the some 20,000 U.S. and NATO troops out of Afghanistan immediately, while the U.S. seeks a withdrawal in phases that would depend on the Taliban meeting certain conditions such as a reduction in violence.\n\nAttacks have surged in recent months, including Taliban assaults on two provincial capitals over the weekend, as the group also seeks to strengthen its negotiating position with the Afghan government in the even more challenging intra-Afghan talks that are meant to follow a U.S.-Taliban deal. The Taliban have rejected talking with the government so far, dismissing it as a U.S. puppet.\n\nSome analysts also have warned that some factions of the Taliban might be expressing displeasure with the U.S. deal, though Taliban political leaders at the talks in Qatar have insisted that their tens of thousands of fighters would respect whatever agreement is reached.\n\nThe militant group is at its strongest since the U.S.-led invasion to topple its government after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the U.S. The Taliban now control or hold sway over roughly half of Afghanistan.\n\nThe United Nations and others say civilians are suffering, often caught in the cross-fire as government forces, backed by the U.S., pursue the militants with airstrikes and raids. Afghanistan was the world\u2019s deadliest conflict in 2018.\n\nThe Taliban spokesman, Mujahid, said that whenever there is a reduction of violence in Afghan cities, the government asserts that the militant group is no longer able to carry out attacks because of stronger Afghan security forces.\n\n\u201cThey should realize that they can\u2019t stop the Taliban,\u201d Mujahid said. \u201cHopefully they must understand that by now.\u201d", "description": "The Taliban took credit for a car bombing in Kabul as they and the U.S. engage in peace talks meant to reduce U.S. military presence in Afghanistan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6e985e240000320072e477.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
