USA TODAY\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that he plans to attend Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday at Nationals Park in Washington.\n\nWith the Washington Nationals holding a 2-0 lead over the Houston Astros, there's no guarantee that Sunday's game will be played. Houston would need to win one of the next two games to assure a fifth game in the series.\n\nEvery president since William Taft in 1910 has thrown out a ceremonial first pitch, either for Opening Day, the All-Star Game or the World Series, but Trump won't be doing so on Sunday, according to the Nationals.\n\n\"They got to dress me up in a lot of heavy armor. I\u2019ll look too heavy. I don\u2019t like that,\u201d Trump said when asked whether he planned to throw the first pitch.\n\nTrump's presence at the game may overshadow the baseball, as the Nationals seek their first World Series title.\n\n\"I don't want to attack him like I got something against (him),\" Nationals pitcher Anibal Sanchez said. \"I'm from Venezuela, I'm out of this country, but then I respect all those situations. And like I say, he's the president and if he want to come, why not?\"", "description": "President Trump said he plans to attend Game 5 of the World Series in Washington between the Astros and Nationals, if the game is necessary.", "authors": ["Jesse Yomtov", "Published P.M.
