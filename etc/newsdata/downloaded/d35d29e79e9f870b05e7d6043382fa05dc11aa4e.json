The Trump administration has sought to block lawmakers from viewing the complaint, and details of its contents leaked into the press in subsequent days. Trump himself has seemed to confirm many of the reports, acknowledging in recent days that he both broached the topic of a Biden probe on the phone call and sought to delay hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid meant for Ukraine.\n\nAlthough the president has denied offering any quid pro quo in exchange for a corruption investigation into Biden, Pelosi and the Democratic Party have said such an offer was not necessary.\n\n\u201cThis week the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,\u201d Pelosi said on Tuesday. \u201cThe actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump on Tuesday announced via tweet that he would be releasing a \u201ccomplete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\u201d of the call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Pelosi asserted that this would not be sufficient for her investigators, instead demanding that the entirety of the complaint be turned over when the acting director of national intelligence testifies on Thursday.\n\nThe president used this as fuel for his outrage, tweeting: \u201cThey never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nAccording to the speaker\u2019s outline of what the impeachment probe would look like, the six committees currently investigating the president \u2014 Judiciary, Intelligence, Oversight, Finance, Ways and Means, and Foreign Affairs \u2014 would \u201cproceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe president lashed out at several of those committee heads and Pelosi, asking incredulously: \u201cCan you believe this?\u201d In his fourth tweet in a matter of 10 minutes, Trump offered a familiar refrain, accusing Democrats of \u201cPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s reelection campaign had a more positive take on the new developments, calling them evidence that Democrats felt threatened by Trump\u2019s electoral prospects and declaring them a boon to his campaign.\n\n\u201cDemocrats can\u2019t beat President Trump on his policies or his stellar record of accomplishment, so they\u2019re trying to turn a Joe Biden scandal into a Trump problem,\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. \u201cThe misguided Democrat impeachment strategy is meant to appease their rabid, extreme, leftist base, but will only serve to embolden and energize President Trump\u2019s supporters and create a landslide victory for the President.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/86/3a/e579a2ce4af5bc28d30abbb40abe/20190924-donald-trump-look-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
