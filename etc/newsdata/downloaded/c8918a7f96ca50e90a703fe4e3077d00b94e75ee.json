What she had was a bunch of startup ideas. She and her fianc\u00e9, who already had his own small tech company, signed a prenup with clear terms, Mazzei said: \u201cThe spouse who has an idea [and] starts a business \u2018owns\u2019 that business. It\u2019s their baby.\u201d\n\nA few years later, Mazzei, a partner at Sideman Bancroft, was traveling through the San Francisco airport when she saw her former client on a magazine cover. Her startup had struck gold. Her husband\u2019s business had fizzled.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, where penniless programmers fervently believe their ideas are worth billions, getting rich can take priority over getting married. California law assumes that any wealth created during a marriage is community property, which should be split equally in a divorce. That\u2019s alarming not just for young entrepreneurs but also their investors.\n\nDivorce Havoc\n\nFortunately, a well-written prenup is a safeguard against post-divorce havoc, which is why more and more young couples are insisting on the agreements, according to more than half-a-dozen lawyers in the Bay Area and elsewhere. Long popular with older wealthy couples who re-marry, prenups are also being demanded by entrepreneurs who want to keep future windfalls to themselves.\n\n\u201cI am seeing more and more young people want to enter into prenuptial agreements who do not currently have a lot of money now but plan to have a lot of money someday,\u201d said Manhattan-based divorce attorney Jacqueline Newman.\n\nIn a 2016 survey by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, 3 in 5 divorce attorneys said more clients were seeking prenups in the past three years. About half said they\u2019d seen a spike in the number of millennials requesting the agreements.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s concepts and notions of fairness when it comes to privately held businesses are changing,\u201d said Mazzei, adding she\u2019s seen \u201ca tremendous increase\u201d in prenups in the past eight years. \u201cThey feel that even if they\u2019re married, this is their passion. The agreement should be reflective of that.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Complicated\u2019\n\nToday\u2019s startup founders have plenty of prenup-writing forebears to emulate. Google co-founder Sergey Brin and Anne Wojcicki, who helped found personal genomics company 23andMe, had a prenup when they married in 2007. After they divorced with little fanfare in 2015, his stake in Google remained unchanged.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated -- that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d Wojcicki told Bloomberg TV about the split.\n\nOracle Corp.\u2019s Larry Ellison has been married and divorced multiple times, but none affected his stake in the software company. Ellison is the seventh-richest person in the world with a net worth of $59.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nStill, a prenup hardly guarantees a smooth divorce. Judges can and do throw out the agreements, especially if they\u2019re drafted poorly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t put in the right language, a lot of prenups don\u2019t do the job,\u201d said Lowell Sucherman, a divorce attorney at Sucherman Insalaco in San Francisco.\n\nIn 2017, One Kings Lane co-founder Alison Gelb Pincus, wife of Zynga Inc. founder Mark Pincus, challenged their premarital agreement in court while the couple was getting a divorce, according to a court filing. It\u2019s unclear whether she prevailed as final terms of the divorce aren\u2019t public.\n\nWhile venture capital firms don\u2019t explicitly require prenups, they do demand legal language protecting their investments in the event a divorce court hands a chunk of a founder\u2019s shares to an ex-spouse. So do other co-founders.\n\nFounders\u2019 Control\n\n\u201cFounders have wanted to ensure that someone else can\u2019t suddenly come in and obtain some sort of founders\u2019 control,\u201d said Par-Jorgen Parson, a partner at venture capital firm Northzone, who has served on the board of Spotify Technology SA. \u201cIt\u2019s just as often driven by the founders as by external investors. You don\u2019t want to rock the balance of power.\u201d\n\nVenture capital firms often demand that founders\u2019 husbands and wives sign \u201cspousal consent\u201d forms. Such agreements determine who gets to vote for board members, and how and when shares can be sold. In the event of a divorce settlement (or death or disability), a founders\u2019 spouse might end up with company shares. But, the agreements ensure that an ex can\u2019t exercise much, if any, control over the company post-divorce.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The young woman in Monica Mazzei\u2019s San Francisco law office was adamant: She wanted a prenuptial agreement.Never mind that the client had barely anything to her name.
