Yet the S&P 500 has gained more than 20% year-to-date.\n\nSo are these fears overblown, or is it just a matter of time until a recession infiltrates the US economy? Deteriorating economic indicators say one thing, but stocks say another.\n\nJohn Blank, chief equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research, thinks he has it figured out what to watch \u2014 and he's relying on a metric he refers to as \"the only investment indicator you need.\"\n\nThat metric is the final, revised number of nonfarm payrolls.\n\nThe words \"final\" and \"revised\" are key here. That's because the confidence interval for monthly changes in nonfarm payrolls is plus/minus 110,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Not exactly peanuts in the grand scheme of things.\n\n\"You want the final, revised numbers to be above 125,000, and the economy then is in a steady state around 2% of growth,\" he stated in an exclusive interview with Business Insider. \"That's the basic idea that I try to get across to people.\"\n\nRead more: 'A license to print money': A former chemical engineer and Ph.D. with no market experience now makes a living day-trading full time. Here's his 3-step process to finding that one successful trade that makes his day.\n\nHis reasoning comes down to simple math.\n\n\"The civilian labor force in the US \u2014 people actually working \u2014 is roughly 150 million, and that grows at 1% a year,\" he said. \"That means you have 1.5 million workers entering the labor force every single year.\"\n\nDivide that 1.5 million workers by 12, and you arrive at 125,000 workers added per month. A number Blank refers to as \"lukewarm.\"\n\nAnything below that 125,000 threshold spells trouble, while anything above 200,000 indicates an economy firing on all cylinders. Right now, it's in \"OK\" territory, according to Blank. He expects it to come in around the year-to-date monthly average of 161,000 for October.\n\nBut this number has been deteriorating rapidly in 2019. Just a year prior, monthly employment gains averaged 223,000 \u2014 a 27% decline. It's also hit some isolated rough patches, plummeting to just 62,000 in June.\n\nThat's making the investment landscape increasingly difficult for Blank. The economy is in odd spot \u2014 neither hot nor cold \u2014 and due to this notion, he sees the market staying range bound unless payrolls change materially.\n\n\"So we're having two rate cuts; we're having effective introduction of QE by the Federal Reserve,\" he said. \"All of these things should stimulate the market, but there's nothing in the way of slack to stimulate and bring into the economy.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Getting asset prices to tread water doesn't create a stimulus, it just creates no downside. This has been the puzzle of why it's been so tough to make money in this market.\"\n\nWith that being said, Blank thinks it's time to start building a watchlist \u2014 and at the top of his list are growth stocks in the healthcare and technology sectors.\n\nHowever, he doesn't suggest diving in with both feet \"until the worm turns.\"\n\nFor those investors looking to follow Blank's suggestions, here are a pair of exchange-traded funds:", "description": "John Blank, chief equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research, says the market doesn't have adequate slack to stimulate further gains.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db207a2dee01913291832c3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
