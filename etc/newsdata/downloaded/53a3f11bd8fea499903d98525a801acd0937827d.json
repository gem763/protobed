People, I know, are in therapy because of me. Why would I want that to continue?\u201d\n\nMr. Game said in a Facebook post last week he asked for apologies for being \u201cwrong\u201d about the benefits of conversion therapy and called for \u201call [ex-gay] ministry and conversion therapy counselors and organizations shut down.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe memories aren\u2019t all bad. There\u2019s many good memories. But I certainly regret where I caused harm,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI know that creating the organization that still lives was in a large way causing harm. Creating a catchy slogan that put out a very misleading idea of \u2018Freedom from homosexuality through Jesus Christ\u2019 was definitely harmful.\u201d\n\nConversion therapy \u2014 which attempts to change a person\u2019s sexual or gender identity \u2014 has been denounced by major professional medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association.\n\nThe UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute estimates nearly 700,000 LGBTQ adults have gone through conversion therapy, and can increase the chances of depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness, and suicide, according to the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nPractice of conversion therapy on minors has been banned thus far in the District of Columbia as well as 18 states. South Carolina is not among them.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
