USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The second the Pumpkin Spice Latte hit my mouth on a crisp October morning, I knew fall was finally here.\n\nUnseasonably warm temperatures kept the season at bay across the country, but there's little denying it now as yellow and red leaves appear and Halloween fast approaches. Fall, particularly in the Northeast USA, is ripe for many tasty, outdoorsy and family-friendly seasonal activities. I set out to experience all of it in a day \u2013 which, in retrospect, was ambitious \u2013 and found that any combination of traditional fall activities will get you in a seasonal mood faster than you can say \"hocus pocus.\"\n\nWhether you like apple picking, taking in fall foliage or simply wearing flannel, here's everything you need to do to have the perfect fall day.\n\nApple picking\n\nPlucking a perfect, ripe apple off a tree is one of the most quintessential fall activities. Make sure your apples are indeed ripe before you pick them. A way to tell, per PickYourOwn.org: If you notice several healthy apples on the ground (i.e. not rotten or diseased), the apples still on the tree are ready to go. Once you've got your picking out of the way, make an apple pie or apple crumble (and tell everyone you picked the apples yourself).\n\nWhere to go: Any apple orchard near you will suffice (we went to Hollin Farms in Delaplane, Virginia) but if you can't pick them yourself, be sure to stop by your local farmer's market to sweeten up your hum-drum supermarket routine.\n\nPumpkin picking\n\nTo clarify, we're not talking just about pumpkins. Stopping by a pumpkin patch is the perfect place to find all kinds of gourds, plus pumpkins for jack-o-lanterns, decorating your front yard or trying out a pie recipe before Thanksgiving.\n\nWhere to go: In lieu of stealing a pumpkin off your neighbor's lawn (which we don't recommend), see if that apple orchard you chose also has a pumpkin patch, so you can make it a one-stop shop.\n\nYou can find pumpkins (and gourds) of all different shapes and sizes while wandering through a pumpkin patch. (Photo: David Oliver)\n\nGo through a corn maze\n\nI didn't get to do this one this go-round, but corn mazes \u2013 particularly themed ones, such as this one in Illinois honoring the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 \u2013 are ideal for getting into the fall spirit. There's no truer test of any relationship than getting stuck in a corn maze together, so you might as well find out now!\n\nWhere to go: Corn mazes can be found all over the country (click this link for a handy directory).\n\nVisit a vineyard\n\nImagine sipping a glass of your favorite red wine \u2013 or mulled wine, if it gets too chilly \u2013 and checking out beautiful fall foliage. You won't be alone: According to a Turo (billed as the Airbnb for cars) survey of 2,000 Americans, 38.8% go on road trips just for leaf-peeping.\n\nWhere to go: I went to Cana Winery and Chrysalis Vineyards in Virginia, both optimal locations for sipping and scenery. Though you can do this anywhere and anytime in the fall, it's best to wait for the leaves to really start changing for the full fall effect.\n\nWhat else should I do?\n\nIt wouldn't be an ultimate fall day story without a mention of spooky season. Whether you visit a haunted house or opt for a scary theme park excursion, you can do more than sit at home and watch scary movies. That said, if you don't watch \"Hocus Pocus\" during the fall, did fall even happen?\n\nYes please: TripAdvisor's 25 most-popular fall destinations for US travelers\n\nYou're welcome: Fall airfare is cheap \u2013 very cheap \u2013 and other reasons for a quick autumn getaway\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/2019/10/22/apple-picking-corn-mazes-explore-ultimate-fall-day/3986290002/", "description": "Whether you like apple picking, gawking at fall foliage or simply wearing\u00a0flannel, here's everything you need to know\u00a0to have the perfect fall day.", "authors": ["David Oliver", "Published A.M.
