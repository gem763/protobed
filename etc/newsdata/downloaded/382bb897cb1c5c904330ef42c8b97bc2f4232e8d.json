Chris suffered two very serious gunshot wounds but he is recovering well and we wish him the best.\u201d\n\nBut authorities said this story \u2014 which Mr. Grant told to CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo \u2014 does not match surveillance video of the incident.\n\n\u201cCNN ran with it and didn\u2019t bother to verify it. I just want to note that this isn\u2019t something we did to shame the guy, it\u2019s just that what he said is not truthful,\u201d an El Paso Police spokesperson said Wednesday. \u201cWe saw his actions and it\u2019s not like he described. What Grant did amounted to an act of self preservation.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson reportedly didn\u2019t elaborate on what specific parts of the story weren\u2019t true.\n\nWhile the Secret Service would not identify who was detained with an active arrest warrant, a \u201cpolice spokeswoman\u201d confirmed that it was Mr. Grant, according to ABC News.\n\nHe was later released from custody, ABC News reported, and requests for comment from Mr. Grant have gone unanswered.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
