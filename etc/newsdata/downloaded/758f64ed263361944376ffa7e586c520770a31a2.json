Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nThe Treasury Department unveiled the sanctions later Monday. They targeted the Turkish Ministry of National Defense and Ministry of Energy and National Resources, as well as the leaders of those two agencies and the head of the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinFurious Republicans prepare to rebuke Trump on Syria White House officials stand by Syria withdrawal, sanctions delay amid bipartisan pushback Trump: Treasury 'ready to go' on sanctions against Turkey: 'Stay tuned' MORE told reporters at the White House that the U.S. was prepared to issue licenses so that the sanctions do not deprive the Turkish people of their energy needs.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve warned all along, our desire is not to shut down the Turkish economy. Our desire is to see an appropriate response,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cThese sanctions will be very severe on the Turkish economy. We can continue to ramp up these sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe order leaves open the possibility of the Trump administration imposing additional sanctions on Turkey depending on its actions in Syria moving forward.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s military offensive is endangering civilians and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cI have been perfectly clear with President Erdogan: Turkey\u2019s action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes.\u201d\n\nTurkey must commit to keeping ISIS at bay and prioritize the protection of civilians and religious minorities in northern Syria, Trump said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economic if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBut he made clear in his statement and his tweets that preceded it that he was committed to withdrawing U.S. troops from northern Syria, a decision that set the stage for Turkey\u2019s offensive and one that has drawn sustained criticism from Republicans in Congress.\n\nThe president said that a \u201csmall footprint\u201d of U.S. forces will remain at Al-Tanf Garrison military base in southern Syria \u201cto continue to disrupt remnants of ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe sanctions announcement is a nod to the groundswell of support on Capitol Hill for tough action against Turkey, though it's unclear if it will be enough for some lawmakers who are preparing their own legislation.\n\nThe announcement came after a meeting of national security officials on Sunday and of other key administration officials at the White House on Monday morning.\n\nTrump has been bombarded with criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike since the White House announced eight days ago that U.S. forces would leave northern Syria, a move that set off a sequence of events that has led to bloodshed and uncertainty in the region.\n\nTurkish forces last week moved into northern Syria, attacking the Kurdish forces that fought alongside the U.S. against ISIS. The offensive produced sobering images and video footage that circulated on social media over the weekend of women and children being killed amid the fighting.\n\nLawmakers and former military officials have asserted that Trump's decision to pull U.S. forces out of the region essentially gave Turkey a green light to move forward with its operation.\n\nIn an effort to turn back the Turkish offensive, the Kurds struck a deal to join Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. The two had previously been on opposing sides of a bloody civil war, and Assad is backed by Russia.\n\nMoments before announcing the sanctions, Trump tweeted that the U.S. should not be responsible for defending the Syrian border or protecting the Kurds. He suggested that Assad, China or Russia could be responsible for those roles instead.\n\nTrump is expected to meet Monday afternoon with Sen.
