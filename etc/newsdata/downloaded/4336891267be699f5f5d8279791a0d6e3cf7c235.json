NVDA, +4.68% rallied 4.3% in morning trading, putting them on track to close at an 11-month high, after BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya said he was more bullish on the graphics chip maker, citing \"unrivaled\" data center growth prospects. The stock's gain was enough to pace the 29 of 30 components of the PHLX Semiconductor Index sox that were gaining ground. Arya reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia's stock and lifted the price target to $250, which is 29% above current levels, from $225. \"[Nvidia's] data center growth is on the cusp of benefiting from the next-big [artificial intelligence] landmark--the ability to accurately listen, understand, speak and contextualize human speech, referred to as natural language processing (NLP)/conversational AI,\" Arya wrote in a note to clients. While Nvidia's cloud spending remains weak near term, gaming sales are recovering and second-half 2019 data center sales could be muted, Arya sees Nvidia producing \"the best organic growth\" among large-capitalization semiconductor companies heading into 2020, driven by new ray-tracing-based gaming cycle and first use of high-performance 7 nanometer manufacturing technology. The stock has run up 16.3% over the past three months, while the chip sector index has gained 6.7% and the S&P 500 SPX, +1.16% has slipped 0.7%.", "description": "Shares of Nvidia Corp. rallied 4.3% in morning trading, putting them on track to close at an 11-month high, after BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya said...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
