Elizabeth Warren was hit over her Medicare for All plan. And Bernie Sanders was questioned about his health.\n\nThe fourth Democratic debate on Tuesday revealed sharper edges than its predecessors, as the candidates were tested by the moderators and challenged by each other.\n\nWith the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump sucking up attention and the clock ticking away to the Iowa caucuses, Pete Buttigieg showed a more aggressive side, while Cory Booker repeatedly called for peace among his Democratic rivals.\n\nThe candidates saved their harshest words for Trump, with every one of the dozen people on stage calling for his impeachment and several calling him the most corrupt president in history.\n\nWarren Won\u2019t Give a Yes or No on Taxes\n\nGiven her recent rise to a statistical tie with Biden at the top of the polls, Warren should have been expecting some sharp questions at Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\nYet early into the event she once again ducked the question when Buttigieg asked whether middle-class tax increases would be needed to fund her signature Medicare for All plan to create a government-run health care system that abolishes private insurance.\n\nShe responded obliquely, saying twice that \u201ccosts\u201d would go up for the rich and would go down for the middle class, giving Buttigieg one of the evening\u2019s most memorable moments. \u201cWe heard it tonight. A yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cYour signature is to have a plan for everything, except this.\u201d\n\nButtigieg said voters should have the right to chose between public or private health insurance as he pitched his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan. He said taking away private insurance would only further polarize an already divided nation. Warren, simply raised her hand while refusing to look at Buttigieg and fired back.\n\n\u201cSo let\u2019s be clear, whenever someone hears the term \u2018Medicare for All who want it,\u2019 understand what that really means: It\u2019s Medicare for all who can afford it,\u201d she said.\n\nRivals Rally Around Biden and His Son\n\nDemocrats at Tuesday\u2019s debate rallied around Biden over his son\u2019s involvement in business deals in Ukraine and China, suggesting that any criticism would only give Trump more ammunition for his unrelenting attacks on the former vice president.\n\n\u201cWe are literally using Donald Trump\u2019s lies and the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman,\u201d Booker said after CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper asked Biden about whether it had been improper for his son Hunter to hold a position on the board of a foreign company.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the debate, several of Biden\u2019s opponents -- including Kamala Harris, Booker and Beto O\u2019Rourke -- had suggested that work like Hunter Biden\u2019s should not be allowed for the children of a president or vice president to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. On Sunday, Hunter Biden announced that he would leave the board of a Chinese firm at the end of October and would forgo all foreign work if his father were elected president.\n\nBut none of Biden\u2019s rivals took him to task on the issue at the debate. He argued there was nothing to the story, which he blamed Trump and \u201chis thugs\u201d for spreading.\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong; I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSanders Is \u2018Feeling Great\u2019 After Heart Attack\n\nSanders saw the question about his heart attack coming, and jumped in, cutting off moderator Erin Burnett.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d he said. But first, he said, he wanted to respond to a back-and-forth on medical marijuana.\n\nBooker interrupted to note that Sanders was in favor of medical marijuana. \u201cI\u2019m not on it tonight,\u201d Sanders joked.\n\nThe 78-year-old was then pressed on how he would would reassure Democratic voters concerned about his recent emergency heart surgery and his age. His answer: by campaigning. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I think I can reassure the American people.\u201d\n\nHe hinted that a \u201cspecial guest\u201d would attend an upcoming rally in Queens. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York will endorse him on Saturday.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Joe Biden faced questions about his son\u2019s work.
