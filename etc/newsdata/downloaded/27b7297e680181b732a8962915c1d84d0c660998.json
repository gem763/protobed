He\u2019s a unique personality. He makes the NFL more fun.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear through seven regular-season games that he was not prepared to be an NFL head coach.\n\nIt\u2019s not his fault. One year ago today, Kitchens was minding his own business as a running backs coach in Cleveland. He wasn\u2019t being groomed to be a head coach in 2019, and he wasn\u2019t in position to try to groom himself to be a head coach in 2019. He was on no one\u2019s radar screen to be hired as a head coach in the next cycle, or ever.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEven after the Browns fired coach Hue Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley on October 29, installing Gregg Williams as head coach and Kitchens as interim offensive coordinator, it wasn\u2019t obvious that Kitchens would have a chance to become the head coach in 2019. So he focused on being the best offensive coordinator he could be, not thinking about the slim possibility that, within months, he\u2019d be an NFL head coach.\n\nAnd then it happened. The team improved unexpectedly, rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield took a shine to Kitchens, the team listened more than it should have to the opinions and preferences of a rookie quarterback, and the team surely didn\u2019t want to risk losing Kitchens to a head-coaching job in 2020 if his positive results with Mayfield as the team\u2019s offensive coordinator continued.\n\nBut Kitchens simply wasn\u2019t, and still isn\u2019t, ready for the job he now has. The fact that he played the \u201cI\u2019m new at this\u201d card earlier in the season proved it. On Sunday, his bizarre handling of a late fourth-down scenario confirmed it.\n\nStory continues\n\nKitchens admitted after the 27-13 loss to the Patriots that he deliberately called for a false start in punt formation in order to save a timeout, even though the end result was a fourth-and-16 long-shot to keep the drive alive. On Monday, it became even more clear that responsibility for the gaffe begins and ends with Kitchens.\n\nSpeaking with reporters, Kitchens acknowledged that he decided at the beginning of the drive in question, which started with 7:43 remaining from the Cleveland 25 after New England has pushed the score to 27-10, that the Browns would not punt on fourth down. But he also failed to properly convey the message to his coaching staff and players, which resulted in the confusion that led to the punt team heading to the field on fourth and 11, and that prompted Kitchens to choose a five-yard penalty over burning a timeout.\n\nAsked whether his plan should have been better communicated to the staff and the players, Kitchens said, \u201cIt should have, yes, which is my fault.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s admirable, but it\u2019s also unavoidable. Once he admits that he made the decision to treat the drive as a four-down proposition before it even began, of course it\u2019s on him to let people know.\n\nThe next time that happens, presumably he will. But if he was truly ready to be a head coach, there wouldn\u2019t have been a first time.\n\nSo here\u2019s the real question for the Browns: How many other \u201cfirst times\u201d will bite them in the behind, while Kitchens learns the job on the fly? And how long will it take for Kitchens to be fully ready to not commit fundamental blunders like this?\n\nHe continues to bristle at the idea that he should relinquish play-calling duties and focus solely on being the head coach.\n\n\u201cIt is not happening,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cI am calling the plays. I am the head coach. That is not happening.\u201d\n\nWell, it needs to happen. Whether G.M. John Dorsey makes that decision or whether ownership does, Kitchens\u2019 lack of preparation to be a coach is causing him to obsessively cling to one of the main talents that got him there in the first place. And someone needs to explain to him that his stubbornness is hurting the team.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s always a chance that, even if he gives up play-calling duties, the mistakes will continue \u2014 without the built-in excuse of working hard to figure out both jobs. At some point, however, the question inevitably will become not whether Kitchens is ready to be a head coach, but whether he\u2019s fit to be one.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t be the first assistant coach to make the dramatic leap from coordinator to head coach and then to learn the hard way that, while he has the skills to be an effective coordinator, he lacks the skills to be an effective head coach. Although the Browns, after too many revolving-door decisions early in the ownership of the team by Jimmy Haslam, presumably are committed to not making rash changes, the fact that a decision can be made quickly doesn\u2019t make it rash.", "description": "Browns coach Freddie Kitchens seems like a great guy.
