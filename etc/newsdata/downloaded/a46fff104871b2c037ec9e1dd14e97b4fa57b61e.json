Sign up here.\n\nTamara Adrine-Davis posted two signs on the front lawn of her Cleveland Heights, Ohio, home late Friday night. One warned passersby: \u201cI\u2019m going to jail cuz I\u2019m broke, disabled, and can\u2019t fix my home.\u201d The other read: \u201cPLEASE HELP\u201d with a link to her GoFundMe page.\n\nThe 57-year-old freelance journalist is currently on probation due to a handful of housing code issues, like chipped and decaying paint, a loose gutter, and a broken front porch stoop. The city first notified Adrine-Davis of the problems back in 2014, but she\u2019s severely disabled, uses a wheelchair, and hasn\u2019t been able to come up with the money to make the more than $8,000 worth of repairs to her home. Now, she could face the city\u2019s maximum penalty for a housing violation case: $1,000 in fines, six months in jail for each offense, or both.\n\nHer next court hearing \u2014 and the deadline for ensuring her home is in compliance \u2014 is Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI have been trying to get ready to go to jail, to be honest with you, and trying to figure out where I can get the money, as if I hadn\u2019t looked all over before,\u201d Adrine-Davis told VICE News. She\u2019s already made arrangements to place her two dogs in someone else's care.\n\nIn some states, Ohio included, facing thousands of dollars in fines over minor property violations \u2014 and even going to jail \u2014 isn\u2019t that unusual. The property codes, instituted and enforced on the municipal level, can help regulate residences that are genuinely dangerous to their inhabitants and neighbors. But they can also unduly punish people living in poverty, and people of color, as Adrine-Davis feels is happening to her.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this kind of bias in a lot of these rules and codes that city\u2019s have against lower-income residents, maybe because they don\u2019t pay enough in tax revenue, or maybe, frankly, because their houses aren\u2019t as nice,\u201d said Joshua House, an attorney at the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit, public interest law firm based in the D.C. area.\n\nIn 2016, for example, a black woman living in Cahokia, Illinois, was arrested over an unmowed lawn. A local official watched over her five children while she was carted off to jail. And this year, an elderly white man\u2019s home in Dunedin, Florida, was threatened with foreclosure after he failed to pay nearly $30,000 in city fines related to his overgrown yard.\n\n\u201cAssuming I survive\u201d\n\nAdrine-Davis said she\u2019s been repeatedly told she could face jail time for failing to fix her home. The city escalated her violation to a criminal offense and took it to Cleveland Heights\u2019 municipal court in January 2018. Almost a year later, she pleaded guilty to the charges and was placed on probation and given time to make repairs.\n\n\n\nThat extra time wasn\u2019t enough, especially since her disability and chronic pain make it difficult for her to earn extra cash through side jobs. While Adrine-Davis paid to fix the gutter, she can\u2019t afford anything else.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t been able to secure a loan to help since her home is in foreclosure after her mom, who had dementia, failed to pay property taxes. And the backpay she owes bars her from the city\u2019s numerous repair aid programs. Her GoFundMe page, which she posted in September, has only raised $80.\n\nThe signs Cleveland Heights resident Tamara Adrine-Davis posted in her yard on Friday, October 5, 2019.\n\nIn August, the city\u2019s housing code inspector also handed her another violation, this time for her for \u201cleaves and yard waste,\u201d a damaged or missing chimney cap, and long tree branches that touched the roof or gutters. It\u2019s unclear whether the judge at her hearing Tuesday will expect her to have addressed those issues, too.\n\n\u201cTaking a resident to court or having to take additional action is not something the city takes lightly,\u201d Tanisha Briley, the city manager of Cleveland Heights, told VICE News. \u201cThese neighbors expect their neighborhood to be beautiful and livable, and they expect the city to take action to make it or keep it that way.\u201d\n\nSince Adrine-Davis hasn\u2019t made any of the repairs to her house \u2014 other than the gutter \u2014 the judge could reinstate her fines Tuesday and send her to jail. She\u2019s not only worried about spending time behind bars but also what will happen to her after she gets out.\n\n\u201cIt will make it much harder for me to rent. I could actually end up coming out \u2014 assuming I survive \u2014 with no place to live,\u201d she said.\n\n\"I go to court, and I see walls of black people.\"\n\nThere\u2019s little data available on housing code violations, specifically, but other offenses like court fines and traffic citations are disproportionately issued to black people. Over the past several years, the Institute for Justice has slung lawsuits at several cities \u2014 many majority black, majority low-income, or both \u2014 and accused them of systematically pushing out residents with housing code regulations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of these middle-class standards that were used to create these housing codes, and sometimes people who are poor just can\u2019t maintain the property,\u201d said Alexes Harris, a sociology professor at the University of Washington who wrote a book on monetary sanctions.\n\nOne 2015 lawsuit targeted Pagedale, Missouri, where nearly 40% of the town\u2019s 3,000 mostly black, poor residents had been ticketed for issues like mismatched blinds, cracked pavement, or a basketball hoop in the driveway. The case was settled after the city agreed to a consent decree and to \u201csubstantially\u201d reform its code enforcement practices.\n\nAs Adrine-Davis awaits her court hearing Tuesday, she no longer trusts city employees and even dismissed her court-appointed attorney because she felt they weren\u2019t working in her best interest. And she doesn\u2019t trust that what\u2019s happening to her is also happening to her white neighbors in Cleveland Heights.\n\n\u201cI go to court, and I see walls of black people,\u201d Adrine-Davis said. \u201cThere was a white woman whose house was also in tax foreclosure, she had not made all of the repairs \u2014 the judge just wished her good luck.\u201d\n\nCover image: Image courtesy of Tamara Adrine-Davis", "description": "\"I\u2019m going to jail cuz I\u2019m broke, disabled, and can\u2019t fix my home.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9b58dce31505000ab4a158/lede/1570467004337-Image-from-iOS.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.4214xh;0xw,0.1463xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
