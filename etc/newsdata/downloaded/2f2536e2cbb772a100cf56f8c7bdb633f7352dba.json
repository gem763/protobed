And Trump, they continued, \u201cis not just soliciting Ukraine\u2019s help with his presidential campaign; he is using U.S. military aid the country desperately needs in an attempt to extort it.\u201d\n\nThe mysterious author of the prescient editorial was Jackson Diehl, the paper\u2019s deputy editorial page editor. Diehl, who confirmed to POLITICO that he reported and wrote the editorial, spent decades as a foreign correspondent and high-ranking editor in the paper\u2019s newsroom before shifting to the editorial department.\n\nWhile the details of the call released on Wednesday do not show Trump explicitly trying to \u201cextort\u201d Zelensky, they still back up the editorial\u2019s bombshell revelation.\n\nAnd the Sept. 5 editorial came well before the Wall Street Journal turbocharged the scandal by reporting on Sept. 20 that Trump had repeatedly pressured Zelensky about Biden.\n\nStill, the Washington Post piece drew some attention at the time, partially fueled by Diehl himself.\n\n\u201cOur Washpost editorial looks at what could be our next election scandal: Trump\u2019s attempt to extort Ukraine\u2019s new government into investigating Joe Biden,\u201d Diehl tweeted at 8:50 p.m. on Sept. 5.\n\nThe editorial has since gathered more accolades for being way out ahead, with MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeting Tuesday, \u201cThis aged pretty well!\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The potentially explosive allegations weren\u2019t presented in the lead of a front page story, but ran on page 20 of the Sept. 6 print edition accompanied by a rather low-key headline, \u201cAn Invitation to Intervene.\u201d\n\nAlso, the formulation used in the editorial \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re reliably told\u201d \u2014 isn\u2019t one that would be found in a straight news story, which typically specifies where sources are coming from, such as attributing information to current or former U.S. officials.\n\n\u201cWe do not always explain to readers, as the news side does, why a source asked to speak without being named,\u201d said Hiatt, who insisted that \u201cthe editorial board is as rigorous as the news side.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The loosely sourced editorial mostly went under the radar despite making the allegation that Trump was urging a foreign leader to probe a political rival.", "authors": ["Michael Calderone"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/61/9d/936f00b249c3a8d4f008833b713d/19219-wapo-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
