(AP) - It is inevitable in sports: Eventually, you will lose. That doesn\u2019t make Kansas State\u2019s first loss any easier for Chris Klieman to stomach.\n\nThe Wildcats\u2019 new coach had won 25 consecutive games stretching nearly than two years _ back to his days at North Dakota State _ before a 26-13 defeat at Oklahoma State last weekend. It came in his first Big 12 matchup and ended a perfect start to his career in the Flint Hills.\n\n\u201cYou take them harder. I\u2019ll be honest,\u201d said Klieman, whose team will try to rebound Saturday against unbeaten Baylor. \u201cAt North Dakota State, every win felt like a relief, and that\u2019s terrible to say. It really is terrible to say that it was a relief because you were a target every week.\n\n\u201cSo when you did lose,\u201d Klieman continued, \u201cit just tore your heart out, and it does. I\u2019m a competitor by nature, and I was really frustrated in myself that we didn\u2019t win. I was frustrated in general that we didn\u2019t play our best football. But I think it\u2019s going to reveal a lot of things from character, resolve, the leaders, and it starts with me.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a good sign for Kansas State, considering Klieman is pretty good coming off a loss.\n\nAfter their 33-21 loss to South Dakota State on Nov. 4, 2017, the Bison blew through the rest of their schedule before winning a national title. In fact, the only time Klieman has lost back-to-back games as a head coach was in 2005 during his single season coaching Loras, a Division III school.\n\n\u201cObviously it was a tough loss,\u201d Kansas State quarterback Skylar Thompson said, \u201cbut the energy and spirit in our team is nothing is changed. Same with our coaches. We know we need to correct some things and get better at some things, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to focus on.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the road for Kansas State (4-1, 0-1) gets any easier.\n\nBaylor (4-0, 1-0) is coming off a heart-stopping 23-21 victory over Iowa State in which the Bears blew a 20-point lead, only to kick a winning 38-yard field goal in the final seconds.\n\nThe win left Baylor coach Matt Rhule with a unique problem.\n\n\u201cI have to make sure we are having enough fun,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we are winning games and guys are going in and saying, \u2018We have to get better.\u2019 And that is a good thing. But you have to enjoy winning, too. It\u2019s a balance. I like where our heads are, and we have to get a lot better this week because Kansas State does not give you a thing.\u201d\n\nNO RHULE CHANGES\n\nBaylor announced a contract extension for its coach that could keep Rhule on the sideline through the 2027 season. Rhule went 1-11 in his first season, 7-6 with a Texas Bowl win last year, and he has the Bears on the rise again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for what we\u2019ll get to and we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do, but we\u2019re going to keep grinding.\u201d\n\nALPHA CHARLIE\n\nCharlie Brewer got hit hard during last week\u2019s game against Iowa State and was \u201cwobbling around,\u201d Rhule said, leading him to remove the quarterback from the game.\n\n\u201cHe got hit in the ribs, so we let Gerry (Bohanon) go,\u201d Rhule said. \u201cThen when Charlie felt better, we got him back out there.\u201d\n\nDEAR JOHN\n\nKansas State quarterback John Holcombe II announced on social media that he would be transferring after falling to No. 3 on the depth chart in fall camp and rarely seeing the field. The Wildcats toyed with changing the athlete\u2019s position but ultimately struggled to build a package for him.\n\nNOBODY KNOWLES\n\nKlieman said he\u2019s unsure whether Kansas State wide receiver Malik Knowles will be available this week due to a lower-body injury. The Wildcats\u2019 leading receiver did not travel to Oklahoma State.\n\n\u201cIt truly will be a week-to-week deal,\u201d Klieman said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping he can do some things in practice.\u201d\n\nDRESS FOR SUCCESS\n\nThe Wildcats refused to embrace alternate uniforms under former coach Bill Snyder, and that was one thing players and fans hoped Klieman would bring. It starts this week with Kansas State unveiling white helmets and pants to go with their traditional purple jerseys and trim.\n\n\u201cWe always had hope,\u201d cornerback A.J. Parker said. \u201cWe did something every year, like the camo (helmets) that one year. So we\u2019ve always done something, but this is the one year that we changed the helmet and the pants.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It is inevitable in sports: Eventually, you will lose.
