Is it the car-sharing or the ride-hailing? But the data we now have from Rwanda is super valuable,\" Thomas Schaefer told reporters late on Monday.\n\nGlobal carmakers including VW, Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Peugeot are seeking to develop markets in Africa, where incomes and consumer aspirations are rising.\n\nBut low new passenger car sales - partly the result of a lack of financing and cheaper imported used cars - have made it difficult to justify investing in local manufacturing and assembly.\n\nVW will begin assembling its Tiguan, Teramont, and Passat models by the end of this year at a plant in Ghana that will initially have the capacity to produce 5,000 cars per year.\n\nGhana's government approved a new automotive policy in August aimed at encouraging carmakers to invest in local production.\n\n\"It ticks all the boxes: reduction and eventual phase-out of used cars, improvement of petrol and diesel quality, introduction of preferential financing. All the critical topics have been addressed,\" Schaefer said.\n\nDespite industry efforts to expand in sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa - the continent's most developed economy - remains the only market of scale for new car sales.\n\nVW's South African facilities are on track to produce some 162,000 cars and another 100,000 engines this year - a record for the company in South Africa - Schaefer said. About two-thirds of those vehicles are destined for the export market.", "description": "VW weighs expanding ride-hailing business to Ghana", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9L13N_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
