The actor hugged the woman as she chatted on her phone, presumably arranging their transport home.\n\nBut when she walked off to flag down their car, Ben stumbled around before falling backwards but luckily managed to catch himself on the vehicle parked behind. After somewhat regaining his composure, Ben walked cautiously towards his waiting car before climbing in.\n\nA source told Metro.co.uk that Ben is continuing to work on his sobriety everyday, following a rehab stint in August 2018 when he received treatment for alcoholism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe insider explained: \u2018He continues to contend with this disease and is doing so very publicly.\n\n\u2018While he works very hard at this, everyday is a new battle.

Because of that, one is never really in or out of treatment. It is a full-time commitment. I am fighting for myself and my family.

To those people, I want to say thank you.\u2019\n\nThe actor added: \u2018With acceptance and humility, I continue to avail myself with the help of so many people and I am grateful to all those who are there for me.
