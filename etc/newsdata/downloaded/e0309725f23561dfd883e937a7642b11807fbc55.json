A North Korean man later died from his wounds.\n\nThe detentions have sparked a rare confrontation between North Korea and Russia, which sees itself as an important player in international talks on defusing nuclear tensions around the reclusive state\u2019s missile program and an ally to Pyongyang.\n\nNorth Korea, which is reeling under sanctions over its weapons program, has for years struggled with food shortages and a dysfunctional state rationing system.\n\nInterfax said the latest arrests were made by Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service from Sept. 28-30 and more than 4,000 squid and banned fishing equipment were also seized.\n\nIt said border guards had also saved the lives of 174 North Koreans from 26 fishing vessels that had got into distress in the same period.", "description": "Russian border guards have detained 87 North Korean poachers and 11 small vessels in waters in the Sea of Japan which Moscow considers its own exclusive economic zone, the Interfax news agency said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
