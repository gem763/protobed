Only Jerry Rice (1,549) has more. \u2026 Buffalo\u2019s Frank Gore rushed for 109 yards in the Bills\u2019 16-10 loss to New England, giving him 15,021 for his career - the fourth player with at least 15,000. He joins Pro Football Hall of Famers Emmitt Smith (18,355), Walter Payton (16,726) and Barry Sanders (15,269). \u2026 Atlanta\u2019s Julio Jones had four catches for 52 yards in his 115th game, giving him 11,048 yards receiving - surpassing Calvin Johnson (127 games) to become the fastest player in NFL history to reach the mark.\n\n___\n\nSTREAKS & STATS\n\nKansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes had his streak of throwing at least two touchdown passes stopped at 14 games after going without one in the Chiefs\u2019 34-30 win at Detroit. He was also the first player in league history to have at least 350 yards passing and three touchdowns without an interception in three straight games before getting slowed in Detroit. He was 24 of 42 for 315 yards against the Lions. \u2026 The Chargers\u2019 30-10 victory was the team\u2019s first in Miami since an overtime playoff thriller in January 1982. They had lost eight straight in Miami. \u2026 Tom Brady\u2019s 45.9 passer rating in New England\u2019s 16-10 win at Buffalo was the sixth lowest of his career and lowest since finishing with a 34 rating in a 27-20 loss to Indianapolis on Nov. 5, 2006. The Patriots had lost the previous six times Brady finished with a passer rating of 48 or lower. Brady did improve to 31-3 against Buffalo, extending the NFL career mark for most victories by a quarterback against one opponent. \u2026 The Seahawks continued their dominance inside State Farm Stadium with another win, 27-10 at Arizona. Seattle hasn\u2019t lost in Glendale since 2012, with a 6-0-1 record during that span, including a 2016 tie. \u2026 Tampa Bay\u2019s 55-40 win over the Los Angeles Rams was the highest-scoring game in the Buccaneers\u2019 44-year history. \u2026 Leonard Fournette ran for a career-high 225 yards in Jacksonville\u2019s 26-24 win over Denver, ending the Jaguars\u2019 drought of 100-yard rushes at 22 games - the second-longest streak in the NFL behind Philadelphia\u2019s 32-game drought. \u2026 New England\u2019s Devin McCourty has an interception in four straight games to start the season.\n\n___\n\nSTARTS\n\nKansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes became the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era (since 1966) to lead a team to multiple 4-0 starts before his 25th birthday. \u2026 New England is 4-0 for the first time in four years. \u2026 Washington\u2019s 0-4 start is its worst since the Redskins lost their first five in 2001.\n\n___\n\nGOFF OFF\n\nJared Goff passed for a career-high 517 yards and two touchdowns, but the Rams\u2018 $134 million quarterback also threw three interceptions for the second time in his career as Los Angeles fell to Tampa Bay 55-40. He completed 45 of a whopping 68 passes, and also lost a fumble that was returned 37 yards for a touchdown by Ndamukong Suh.\n\n___\n\nDARTH RAIDER\n\nRaiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict was ejected early in the second quarter of Oakland\u2019s 31-24 win at Indianapolis after being called for unnecessary roughness on a helmet-to-helmet collision with tight end Jack Doyle. Even before referee Scott Novak announced to the crowd what a replay review determined, Burfict was jogging into the locker room. It\u2019s not the first time Burfict has run afoul of league rules. He had 11 fines and suspensions in seven seasons with Cincinnati before joining the Raiders.\n\n___\n\nBIG GUYS UP FRONT\n\nTennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota praised the protection provided by his offensive line after he was not sacked in the Titans\u2019 24-10 win at Atlanta. It was a dramatic turnaround for the line after Tennessee allowed 17 sacks in its first three games - almost six per game. \u201cThose guys up front did a great job,\u201d Mariota said.\n\n___\n\nSHAQ ATTAQ\n\nTampa Bay linebacker Shaquil Barrett had a sack, forced fumble and interception in the Buccaneers\u2019 55-40 win over the Los Angeles Rams. He has nine sacks this season, tied with Mark Gastineau (1984), Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila (2001) and Kevin Greene (1998) for the most through a team\u2019s first four games since 1982 when the individual sack became an official statistic.\n\n___\n\nBIG MAC\n\nCarolina running back Christian McCaffrey had 179 yards from scrimmage yards - 93 rushing and 86 receiving - and a touchdown run in the Panthers\u2019 16-10 win at Houston. He had 209 yards from scrimmage yards and two touchdowns in Week 1 and 188 yards from scrimmage yards and a touchdown in Week 3, joining Pro Football Hall of Famer Jim Brown (1963) as the only players in league history with three games of at least 175 yards from scrimmage and one touchdown in their team\u2019s first four games of a season. McCaffrey also caught 10 passes in the win Sunday, his sixth career game with at least that many - tying Larry Centers and LaDainian Tomlinson for the most career games with at least 10 by a running back in NFL history.\n\n___\n\nTARGET PRACTICE\n\nOakland tight end Darren Waller had seven catches for 53 yards in the Raiders\u2019 31-24 win at Indianapolis. That gives him 33 receptions on the season, tying him with Antonio Gates (33 in 2007) for the most catches by a tight end through his team\u2019s first four games of a season in NFL history.\n\n___\n\nNOT FOR LONG\n\nThe Miami Dolphins (0-4) held a lead for the first time this season, but it lasted only 3 minutes, 49 seconds as they lost 30-10 to the Los Angeles Chargers. The Chargers have been outscored 163-26 this season, which is the NFL\u2019s worst four-game point differential since at least 1940.\n\n___\n\nSIDELINED\n\nChicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky left the game against Minnesota because of a left shoulder injury. A scrambling Trubisky was hurt on the opening possession when Danielle Hunter dragged him down and the quarterback\u2019s arm got pinned awkwardly under his body as the ball popped out. \u2026 Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen was placed in the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol after taking a helmet-to-helmet hit by Patriots defensive back Jonathan Jones in the opening minute of the fourth quarter of a 16-10 loss to New England. \u2026 Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Melvin Ingram left the game in the first quarter at Miami with a hamstring injury. \u2026 Detroit tight end T.J. Hockenson (concussion) was carted off the field in the third quarter against Kansas City. Chiefs defensive end Alex Okafor (hip) and linebacker Damien Wilson (concussion) left in the fourth quarter of the win at Detroit. \u2026 Houston wide receiver Kenny Stills injured his hamstring on the last play of the first quarter against Carolina and didn\u2019t return.\n\n___\n\nSPEAKING\n\n\u201cIt was terrible. We\u2019ve got to do better \u2026 I don\u2019t really have any answers. I\u2019ve got to go back and watch the film. I have to start like right now.\u201d - Houston coach Bill O\u2019Brien after the Texans struggled on offense in a 16-10 loss to Carolina.\n\n___\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re 0-4 and you\u2019ve got two options: You can hang your head and feel sorry for yourself or you can come out and battle your (butt) off next week, which I know we will. It\u2019s unfortunate. Nobody saw this coming, starting the season like this. I sure didn\u2019t, but here we are. Reality has set in.\u201d - Washington coach Jay Gruden after the Redskins dropped to 0-4 with a 24-4 loss to the New York Giants.\n\n___\n\n\u201cIf one of us did that to 12, we wouldn\u2019t have been in the game anymore,\u201d Buffalo safety Micah Hyde, referring to Tom Brady\u2019s number after New England\u2019s Jonathan Jones drew only a personal foul for unnecessary roughness and wasn\u2019t also ejected from the game after his helmet-to-helmet hit on Bills quarterback Josh Allen.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "SCOREBOARD", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/buccaneers_rams_football_98715_c0-682-1487-1548_s1770x1032.jpg?c14c5abe385afffc4226c99f5e7bcb6f918a893b", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
