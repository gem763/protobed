Investigators also found eight pregnant women from the Marshall Islands in raids of his properties outside Phoenix, and several more are waiting to give birth in Utah, authorities said.\n\n\u201cThe commoditization of children is simply evil,\u201d said Utah Attorney General Sean D. Reyes.\n\nThe adoptive parents are considered victims along with the birth mothers, and no completed adoptions will be undone, authorities said.\n\nPetersen\u2019s attorney, Matthew Long, defended his client\u2019s actions during a Tuesday court hearing in Phoenix as \u201cproper business practices\u201d and said they disagreed with the allegations.\n\nPetersen served a two-year mission in the Marshall Islands for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Reyes said. He was later recruited by an international adoption agency while in law school because of his fluency in Marshallese, according to a 2013 Phoenix Business Journal story.\n\nProsecutors say Petersen used associates there to recruit pregnant women by offering many of them $10,000 each to give up their babies for adoption. Petersen would pay for the women to travel to the U.S. days or months before giving birth and live in a home that he owned until delivering the baby, according to the court records.\n\nThe expecting mothers were often crowded in the homes, with Marshallese women Petersen employed helping with things like translation, transportation, legal documents and applications for Medicaid benefits, prosecutors said.\n\nWomen got little to no prenatal care in Utah, and in one house slept on mattresses laid on bare floors in what one shocked adoptive family described as a \u201cbaby mill,\u201d according court documents.\n\nPetersen sold the house this spring as complaints mounted from neighbors in the working-class area in suburban Salt Lake City, said new owner Alanna Mabey.\n\nShe was told it had been used as a rental, and since purchasing it she has found trash like dirty diapers in the bushes, she said. The news about how prosecutors say expecting mothers were treated there is \u201chorrible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d\n\nIn Arkansas, it wasn\u2019t uncommon to find a dozen Marshallese mothers on the verge of giving birth in one house, said Duane Kees, the U.S. attorney for the western district of Arkansas.\n\n\u201cMany of these mothers described their ordeal as being treated like property,\u201d Kees said. \u201cMake no mistake: this case is the purest form of human trafficking.\u201d\n\nArkansas has one the largest concentrations of Marshallese immigrants in the U.S. and the women would then be flown there or back to the Marshall Islands after giving birth, authorities said.\n\nPetersen charged families $25,000-$40,000 per adoption and brought about $2.7 million into a bank account for adoption fees in less than two years, according to court documents.\n\nPetersen\u2019s Mesa, Arizona, home is worth more than $600,000 and located in an affluent, gated community.\n\nThe Utah probe began after investigators got a call to a human-trafficking tip line in October 2017. Staff at several hospitals in the Salt Lake City area would eventually report an \u201cinflux\u201d of women from the Marshall Islands giving birth and putting their babies up for adoption, often accompanied by the same woman.\n\nThe scheme defrauded Arizona\u2019s Medicaid system of $800,000 because the women had no intention of remaining in the state when they applied, according to Arizona prosecutors.\n\nUnder a compact between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Marshallese citizens can enter the U.S. and work without a visa, unless they\u2019re traveling for the purpose of adoption, authorities said.\n\nPetersen has faced troubles with his adoption practices in the past. An Arizona juvenile court judge in 2016 denied a couple\u2019s request to adopt a child born to a Marshallese woman because he feared the arrangement set up by Petersen had violated that country\u2019s law. A court of appeals reversed the decision, saying no Marshallese approval was necessary.\n\nAuthorities do not believe the women were misled into believing their children might be returned at some point.\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said adoptive parents who went through Petersen\u2019s agency have nothing to worry about.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s going to go back and redo adoptions or any of that kind of stuff,\u201d Brnovich said.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writers Lindsay Whitehurst and Morgan Smith in Salt Lake City, Astrid Galvan in Phoenix, Andrew DeMillo in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Felicia Fonseca in Flagstaff, Arizona, contributed to this report.", "description": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 An Arizona politician ran an adoption fraud scheme that promised pregnant women thousands of dollars to lure them from a Pacific Island", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/a28aaf_arizona-official-adoption-fraud-52937-undated-booking-photo-by-maricopa-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
