These programs, such as our national, toll-free helpline and peer support, help people with breast cancer live their lives as fully as possible.\n\n\u201cSince the Run began in 1992, it has raised $462 million for the breast cancer cause,\u201d says Andrea Seale, CEO, CCS. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the funds Canadians raise through the CIBC Run for the Cure that we know more than ever how to prevent, diagnose, treat and live with and beyond breast cancer, and have been able to help reduce the mortality rate by almost half since it peaked in 1986.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian Cancer Society CIBC Run for the Cure is a trailblazing partnership between CCS, CIBC and communities across Canada. This year\u2019s Run marked CIBC\u2019s 23rd year as title sponsor. Together with tens of thousands of participants and supporters across the country, the Run has created a movement that brings Canadians together in support of friends, family and loved ones who experience breast cancer.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday was another incredible day for thousands of Canadians as we came together with shared purpose to imagine a future without breast cancer,\u201d said Christina Kramer, CIBC's Senior Executive Vice-President and Executive Run Sponsor, CIBC. \u201cTeam CIBC has proudly run alongside those affected by breast cancer for 23 years because for us, this is personal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFor more than two decades, Team CIBC and its 44,000 passionate team members have been supporting events like the Canadian Cancer Society CIBC Run for the Cure,\u201d says Seale. \u201cWe are so grateful to Team CIBC for joining us once again this year and promising to make breast cancer beatable. Along with participants and volunteers from coast-to-coast, together, we are a force-for-life in the face of breast cancer.\u201d\n\nThe first CIBC Run for the Cure took place in 1992 in Toronto\u2019s High Park. A group of volunteers brought together approximately 1,500 people and raised $85,000 for the breast cancer cause. Since then, the event has grown and each year unites thousands of Canadians.\n\n\n\nAbout the Canadian Cancer Society CIBC Run for the Cure\n\nThe Canadian Cancer Society CIBC Run for the Cure is the largest, single-day, volunteer-led event dedicated to raising funds for the breast cancer cause.
