Meh. That can be camouflaged, even draped in the flag as long as you ignore the unemployed black quarterback kneeling before it.\u201d\n\nLe Batard accused fans of ignoring the league\u2019s ethical qualms, such as the mascot of the Washington franchise and the presence of players with legally dubious histories, as long as they can wager on games and draft players for their fantasy football teams.\n\n\u201cThe next 17 Sundays are not about brain power; they\u2019re just about power, hostile and huge, and there isn\u2019t an addiction in sports as powerful as the one that approaches in a few hours,\" he said near the end of the segment. \"[Colin] Kaepernick can\u2019t kneel without being unemployed for three years, but now all of sports America does, to genuflect before our king in the biggest of sports religions, here in the House of Goodell.\u201d\n\nAn NFL representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ESPN declined comment.\n\nLe Batard, who also hosts a radio show for ESPN, made national headlines in July when he criticized supporters of President Trump who chanted, \u201cSend her back!\u201d in reference to Somalia-born Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) at a campaign rally. He said the event \u201cfelt un-American\u201d and the chants were \u201cdeeply offensive.\u201d During the same show, he denounced ESPN\u2019s policy that forbids political commentary on its airwaves.\n\n\u201cWe here at ESPN don\u2019t have the stomach for the fight,\u201d Le Batard said on the air. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about what is happening unless there is some sort of weak, cowardly sports angle that we can run it through.\u201d\n\nStop what you're doing and watch this.@LeBatardShow responds to the racist \"Send her back\" and \"Go back to your country\" attacks against Ilhan Omar and other congresswomen.\n\n\n\n\"If you're not calling it abhorrent, obviously racist, dangerous rhetoric, you're complicit.\" pic.twitter.com/ntOC2Seg3b \u2014 Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) July 18, 2019\n\nThose remarks drew a reprimand from higher-ups at ESPN. Le Batard was summoned to New York to meet with network president Jimmy Pitaro, who since taking over in March 2018 has said ESPN\u2019s viewers do not want the network to cover political issues that do not intersect with sports.\n\n\u201cWe have to understand we\u2019re here to serve sports fans,\u201d Pitaro said in an interview with The Washington Post weeks before Le Batard\u2019s previous comments. \u201cAll sports fans.\u201d\n\nESPN has previously had to navigate high-profile employees taking on the NFL. Columnist Bill Simmons was dismissed from the network in 2015 after criticizing Commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s handling of domestic violence allegations against then-Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and the New England Patriots\u2019 \u201cDeflategate\u201d controversy. Then-ESPN president John Skipper later said Simmons\u2019s ouster \u201chad nothing to do with his comments about the commissioner. I severed our relationship with Bill because of his repeated lack of respect for this company and, more importantly, the people who work here.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHow to replace Antonio Brown in your fantasy football lineup\n\nLiberty Coach Hugh Freeze won\u2019t be laying down on the job anymore\n\nFive preposterously positive Redskins predictions for 2019\n\nThe Redskins are major underdogs in Week 1.
