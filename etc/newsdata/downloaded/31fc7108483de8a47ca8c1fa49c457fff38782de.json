Please, I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nThe order of the list doesn\u2019t matter to Joanne, who decided to shoot her shot by calling the champ out anyway.\n\n\u201cPeople that are on the list is really not that important because even one person on the list was already retired,\u201d Joanne said. \u201cI can mark anybody off the list and add anybody onto my list. You do not want to be added onto this list because you\u2019re going to be crossed off.\u201d\n\nTrained by the Pitbull Brothers, Joanne was able to spoil the promotional debut of Rawlings, who was looking to ride her momentum from competing with Bare Knuckle FC.\n\n\u201cShe was the person coming from the UFC, she had a lot of hype, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me,\u201d Joanne said. \u201cI came in here to do my job, and I did a job well done.\n\n\u201cNobody knows who I am, and she may be thinking that I was going to be an easy fight for her.\u201d\n\nPerhaps a little too soon for Joanne to be getting a title shot, but she\u2019s currently on a three-fight win streak and, most importantly, is game to take on the division\u2019s best. So why not try and call out the champ? She\u2019s got a list to attend to regardless.", "description": "Ilara Joanne has a hit list that includes flyweight champ Ilima-Lei Macfarlane, but she believes she's ready for a shot at the title.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ilara-joanne-bellator-231-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
