The president didn\u2019t confirm the reports at the time.\n\nMr. Trump said Hamza bin Laden was killed in an operation in the \u201cAfghanistan/Pakistan region\u201d and said that he was \u201cresponsible for planning and dealing with various terrorist groups.\u201d He didn\u2019t provide any additional details . U.S. officials had become increasingly concerned in recent years about Hamza bin Laden\u2019s repeated threats and calls for attacks on Americans at home and abroad as well as against U.S. allies. U.S. government and private analysts say that al Qaeda is much weaker than it was in its heyday, and less potent than its ideological rival Islamic State. But, they say, al Qaeda is still capable of inspiring terrorist attacks and has several lethal affiliates world-wide. Earlier this year, the State Department offered a reward of up to $1 million for information about him, and Saudi Arabia revoked his citizenship. Those moves followed the State Department\u2019s imposition of sanctions against him in 2017, saying at the time that he was actively engaged in terrorism. Hamza bin Laden was believed to have been born in 1989 in Saudi Arabia and was the only known son of Osama bin Laden who was still aligned with the terrorist group behind the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Another son was killed along with his father in 2011 during a Navy SEAL raid on their compound in Pakistan. A third son has distanced himself from al Qaeda. Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement confirming the death of the younger bin Laden \u2014which was an important U.S. national security objective\u2014comes after a string of foreign-policy stumbles over the past week. These included a furor over Mr. Trump\u2019s plans, later canceled, to invite Afghan Taliban leaders to the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., during the week of Sept. 11 and the revelation of Oval Office arguments leading to the resignation of White House national security adviser John Bolton.
