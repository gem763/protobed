Malaysian ringgit and the Korean won KRW=KFTC strengthened 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively, while the Philippine peso firmed 0.4%. The Philippine central bank is set to announce its policy interest rate next week.\n\nThe Indonesian rupiah IDR=ID remained little changed.\n\nBank Indonesia on Thursday cut interest rates and relaxed lending rules to stimulate growth in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. following table shows rates for Asian currencies against the dollar at 0603 GMT.\n\nCURRENCIES VS U.S. DOLLAR\n\nChange on the day at 0603 GMT\n\nCurrency\n\nLatest bid Previous day Pct Move Japan yen\n\n107.860\n\n108\n\n+0.13 Sing dlr\n\n1.374\n\n1.3783\n\n+0.28 Taiwan dlr\n\n30.958\n\n31.006\n\n+0.16 Korean won\n\n1189.300\n\n1193.6\n\n+0.36 Baht\n\n30.470\n\n30.53\n\n+0.20 Peso\n\n52.040\n\n52.27\n\n+0.44 Rupiah\n\n14050.000 14055\n\n+0.04 Rupee\n\n70.878\n\n71.32\n\n+0.62 Ringgit\n\n4.176\n\n4.19\n\n+0.34\n\n7.085\n\n7.0970\n\n+0.17\n\nChange so far in 2019\n\nCurrency\n\nLatest bid End 2018\n\nPct Move Japan yen\n\n107.860\n\n109.56\n\n+1.58 Sing dlr\n\n1.374\n\n1.3627\n\n-0.85 Taiwan dlr\n\n30.958\n\n30.733\n\n-0.73 Korean won\n\n1189.300\n\n1115.70\n\n-6.19 Baht\n\n30.470\n\n32.55\n\n+6.83 Peso\n\n52.040\n\n52.47\n\n+0.83 Rupiah\n\n14050.000 14375\n\n+2.31 Rupee\n\n70.878\n\n69.77\n\n-1.56 Ringgit\n\n4.176\n\n4.1300\n\n-1.10 Yuan\n\n7.085\n\n6.8730\n\n-2.99 ($1 = 70.97 Indian rupees)", "description": "CORRECTED-EM ASIA FX-Asian currencies advance; rupee surges on India tax cuts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB8F11Z_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
