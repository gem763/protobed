And speculation is heating up about what kind of circuslike spectacle could ensue once a reality TV star president, whose power has come from his ability to capture attention by any means necessary, is the subject of deliberations over whether to remove him from office.\n\nWhat stunts might he pull, similar to the second debate of the 2016 presidential election with Democrat Hillary Clinton, when Trump invited three women who had accused Bill Clinton, the former president and Hillary\u2019s husband, of sexual misconduct, and tried to seat them near the stage? (They were eventually seated in the debate hall but farther back in the audience.)\n\nPhoto illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP, J. Scott Applewhite/AP More\n\nWhat if Trump\u2019s lawyers tried to call former Vice President Joe Biden as a witness in a Senate trial, as some political insiders told Yahoo News might happen? That would throw one of the leading Democratic presidential candidates into the Senate, where he was a member for four decades and where five current senators are running against him for the Democratic nomination, just a few weeks before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses kick off the voting in the primary.\n\nThat would be a major curveball for Democrats, and it\u2019s the kind of thing that most everyone knows Trump is unafraid of, and even eager to seize on.\n\nIn such a scenario, or any like it, the big question is who will decide these questions, like whether someone like Biden could be summoned to appear in the Senate trial.\n\nIt could very well be someone like Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, along with a handful of other Republican senators. Romney \u2014 the 2012 Republican nominee for president \u2014 and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are two of the more independent-minded members of the Senate, and Romney has been engaged in an increasingly high-profile war of words with Trump.\n\nThen there are the Republican senators who are up for reelection in swing states, who will face serious challenges from Democratic candidates and cannot drift too far right with Trump in the impeachment matter: Cory Gardner of Colorado, Martha McSally of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Joni Ernst of Iowa.\n\nSen.

So, if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 who is also up for reelection in 2020 \u2014 were pushing to unite the 53-member Republican majority behind any such motion to approve a witness, he would need the support of at least four of these 14 lawmakers who are most likely to split from Trump.", "description": "The Senate trial for a Trump impeachment is a major wild card.
