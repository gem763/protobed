(OK, I still can\u2019t imagine doing those things, but I can\u2019t even properly work my son\u2019s Kindle Fire, so I\u2019m a bit of a mess when it comes to technology.) Our digital native children, however, eat this stuff up.\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you might want to encourage their desire to learn more about coding, but feel being virtually incapable of helping them figure it out. Enter, the CoderDojo Foundation, which can connect you to people who can help them. For free.\n\nThe CoderDojo movement believes that an understanding of programming languages is increasingly important in the modern world, that it\u2019s both better and easier to learn these skills early, and that nobody should be denied the opportunity to do so. To that end, we\u2019ve built a global network of free, volunteer-led, community-based programming clubs for young people. Anyone aged seven to seventeen can visit a Dojo where they can learn to code, build a website, create an app or a game, and explore technology in an informal, creative, and social environment.\n\nA quick search found three class options in my area that meet either once or twice a month for anywhere from an hour to two and a half hours.\n\nEach Dojo is run by a volunteer in the community and the courses are not curriculum-based, so each class will be a little different. For the most part, though, the website says kids will start with Scratch, a visual programming tool, or by building their own website.\n\nThe Dojos each have their own website with additional class details or contact information for follow-up questions. Most classes require students to bring their own laptops, but some may have extras if your child doesn\u2019t have access to one.\n\nIf you love the idea but don\u2019t see any options in your area (and you are even slightly more tech-savvy than yours truly), the CoderDojo website also has information and online training for how to start your own course. They\u2019ve got more than 2,000 courses going in more than 100 countries, so you\u2019d be in good company.", "description": "When I was a kid, I couldn\u2019t have imagined learning to code, build a website or create an app or a game.
