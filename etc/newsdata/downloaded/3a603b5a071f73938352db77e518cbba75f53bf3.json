Life isn't a fairy tale and these women are dying,\" she said.\n\n\"So many people are affected by cancer and this storyline triggers so many emotions for so many people because it's absolutely heartbreaking, so many people are dying of cancer every day.\"\n\nCervical cancer: What are the stats?\n\nThere are around 3,200 new cases of cervical cancer every year in the UK, according to Cancer Research UK. That works out to an average of nine new diagnosis every day.\n\nAnd while cervical cancer rates declined by around a quarter since the 1990s, they have gone back up by 4% over the last decade. It's now the 14th most common cancer in women.\n\nIt's more common among white females and those living in deprived areas, and according to statistics from the World Health Organisation - 90% of deaths from cervical cancer in 2018 occurred in low and middle-income countries.\n\nBut research suggests that 99.8% cases of cervical cancer in the UK are preventable.\n\nHow can you reduce your risk?\n\nEarlier this month, YouTuber Zoella posted a 43 minute livestream of her undergoing a cervical smear - the test that health checks your cervix.\n\nThat's the procedure all women aged over 25 are advised to take every three years to check the health of their cervix.\n\nAnd it's doing this regularly that can detect cervical cancer in its early stages.\n\nGirls aged between 12 and 13 can receive the HPV vaccine to reduce their risk of cervical cancer on the NHS. It's available to them for free until they reach 18.\n\nFrom September 2019, the vaccine is also being offered to boys aged 12 to 13.\n\nThe HPV vaccine also reduces the risk of mouth and throat cancer, cancers of the anal and genital areas - as well as protecting against genital warts.\n\nBut the vaccine does not negate the need for regular cervical smears.\n\nVisit the NHS website for more information on cervical cancer and smear tests.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "Sinead Tinker was given months to live in an episode of the soap this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7BCF/production/_108759613_sineadcorrie976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
