He will start working for Genesis on Oct. 21 and oversee U.S. sales and marketing.\n\nDel Rosso worked for General Motors, Toyota and Lexus before moving to the Volkswagen Group in 2008, where he served as CEO of Audi and Bentley in the U.S. market. He achieved 77 straight months of sales growth there. He also helped the carmaker achieve its annual sales target of 200,000 cars five years ahead of schedule.\n\nAfter being appointed CEO of Bentley in the U.S. in 2017, Del Rosso revamped the luxury brand's dealership network. He came back as CEO of Audi in the U.S. in December last year, but stepped down after just six months in the job.\n\nFormer head of Nissan's North American operations, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, currently the global chief operating officer of Hyundai, apparently played a key role in luring Del Rosso over to the Korean automaker.\n\nThe Korean carmaker spun off Genesis, once merely a top-range Hyundai model, into a separate brand in 2015 to break into the luxury market.\n\n", "description": "High-Flying Audi Exec to Helm Hyundai's U.S. Sales", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/14/2019101401104_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
