NRA sues San Francisco", "language": "en", "text": "Last week we discussed the embarrassing decision by the San Francisco City Council to label the National Rifle Association a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization.\u201d While that was bad enough to start with, they went several steps further, declaring that they would \u201climit business interactions with the NRA and its supporters.\u201d\n\nThis was clearly a bridge too far for the NRA. They initially released a statement calling this action \u201ca reckless assault on a law-abiding organization, it\u2019s members, and the freedoms they all stand for.\u201d But they aren\u2019t stopping there. Now the case may be heading to court. (Washington Times)\n\nThe National Rifle Association sued San Francisco on Monday over the city\u2019s recent declaration that the gun-rights lobby is a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization.\u201d The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, accuses city officials of violating the gun lobby\u2019s free speech rights for political reasons and says the city is seeking to blacklist anyone associated with the NRA. It asks the court to step in \u201cto instruct elected officials that freedom of speech means you cannot silence or punish those with whom you disagree.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like the NRA has a pretty solid case here. If the city had only passed some sort of nonbinding resolution calling the group a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization\u201d they might have gotten away with it. The best they could probably do in that case would be to accuse the city of slander or something along those lines, but their prospects for success wouldn\u2019t be as promising.\n\nBut when the city elders decided to declare that they would limit business with the NRA and its supporters, they definitely crossed a line. When it comes to the awarding of contracts to do business with the city, every qualified entity or individual has to be given a fair opportunity to bid and compete. I somehow doubt that the NRA is doing much municipal business with the city (unless they\u2019re offering firearms safety instruction there), but they certainly have members in the region who might be.\n\nSan Francisco seems to clearly be saying that they will deny any members or other groups supportive of the NRA and Second Amendment rights the opportunity to bid for such work. That\u2019s got to be illegal and a judge should eventually find that they\u2019ve crossed the line and order them to retract the order.\n\nIf I had to put on my prognostication hat here and guess how it plays out I\u2019d say that the City Council is realizing that they really stepped in it this time and they\u2019re currently looking for a way to save face. That could come in the form of some sort of statement saying everyone misunderstood them and they didn\u2019t mean they would cut off official business. (Perish the thought.) It was all just a statement of principles. They might even redo the resolution to make that more clear. And if that happens, the lawsuit probably collapses and goes away.", "description": "It's on like Donkey Kong", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lapierre-cpac.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
