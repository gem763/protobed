The repeal was mostly upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on Tuesday.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to Pai\u2019s agenda than net neutrality. Among the other agenda items is reform of the FCC\u2019s media ownership rules.\n\nLast week, that latter effort hit a roadblock. Reforms the FCC had adopted were stymied when a three-judge panel of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia threw out the FCC\u2019s reform of those rules. The commission is now considering an appeal.\n\nAs Pai promised to do when he took over as commission chairman in March 2017, he and his Republican colleagues have taken a \u201cweed whacker\u201d to outdated, costly, and unnecessary FCC rules.\n\nThe most controversial among those were the net neutrality rules. The review of the media ownership landscape was a close second.\n\nThose rules, some of which date back to the 1940s, restrict cross-ownership of radio and television stations and newspapers.\n\nIn November 2017, the FCC rolled back many of those media ownership rules. One of them, a 1975 limitation on cross-ownership of newspapers and radio or TV broadcast stations, was repealed completely.\n\nOther rules were modified, such as the cap on owning two TV stations in the same market unless there were at least eight other media outlets in the same community. The FCC replaced that automatic ban with a case-by-case consideration.\n\nThe FCC\u2019s rules were written for the media world of the mid-20th century, not that of today. From the invention of radio and television until the 1970s, broadcasting was characterized by limited competition and little diversity.\n\nOnly three commercial broadcast TV networks operated nationwide, and independent stations could be found only in the biggest of markets. One result was that viewers and listeners enjoyed little variety in programming.\n\nIn entertainment programming, all three commercial broadcast networks offered copycat programming: In the 1960s, for instance, they offered \u201cThe Addams Family\u201d (ABC) vs. \u201cThe Munsters\u201d (CBS); \u201cBewitched\u201d (ABC) vs. \u201cI Dream of Jeannie\u201d (NBC); and \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d (CBS) vs. \u201cThe Outer Limits\u201d (ABC).\n\nNews and public affairs programming was similarly monotone. Each TV network featured a half-hour evening news show, with a reassuring anchor reporting news based upon what was in that morning\u2019s New York Times.\n\nControversy was rarely aired on TV or radio broadcasts, thanks in part to the chill created by the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nToday\u2019s television landscape is radically different. Cable TV increased programming channels available to American households from half a dozen to hundreds, and satellite TV brought it into the thousands.\n\nAnd today, internet-based content-streaming systems make nearly limitless content available to Americans without even having to get up from their couches.\n\nAt the same time, sources of news and information exploded as the \u201cthree wise men\u201d system of evening newscasts was challenged by new cable news networks with 24-hour coverage.\n\nOther platforms for news, such as online newspapers and social media\u2014while not without problems of their own\u2014provide Americans with literally unprecedented choice and diversity of news and opinion.\n\nThe vastly increased choice and competition have made the FCC ownership rules not only unnecessary, but harmful.\n\nRather than rely upon the tender mercies of a handful of news outlets, today\u2019s media consumers can instead choose from a wide variety of sources. Rather than dominate the marketplace, broadcasters and (even more so) newspapers hold on, unsteadily, to a shrinking share of the business.\n\nIn this new world, the ownership limits imposed in the previous century are not needed to protect choice and diversity. Instead, they simply reduce the ability of the legacy media to survive at all.\n\nRecognizing these changes in media, policymakers have struggled for 20 years to repeal or reform the FCC\u2019s media ownership rules. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, in fact, established a process by which such outdated regulations could be repealed.\n\nUnder the act, the FCC was directed to review its rules biennially and eliminate those that are no longer needed.\n\nThe first such biennial review began in 1996, with the ownership rules high on the list of targeted regulations. But no decision had been reached by the time the second review began in 1998.\n\nAgain, no progress was made until 2002, when a reform package was adopted by the FCC. But that reform package was remanded back to the FCC for more study. Ditto in 2007.\n\nThe Sept. 23 decision by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals was the third in a history of court decisions blocking reform.\n\nBut the FCC and Pai are not yet ready to give up on necessary reform. The next step is to ask for a review of the decision by the full 3rd Circuit in an en banc hearing. Failing that, the FCC should appeal to the Supreme Court to step in.\n\nIn the meantime, the antiquated ownership restrictions in place from a long-gone era will continue. As a result, newspapers and many broadcasters will become even less competitive, unable to keep up with the new media world.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s the inevitable result, with or without a push from government regulation. But the decision should be made by consumers, viewers, and listeners in the marketplace, not by regulators enforcing the rules of the previous century.", "description": "Since his appointment as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai has pursued a broad-ranging agenda for regulatory reform.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe centerpiece of that agenda was the repeal of the Obama-era \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules on broadband internet providers.
