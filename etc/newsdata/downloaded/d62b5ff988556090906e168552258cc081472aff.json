(Kevork Djansezian / Getty Images)\n\nTwo of the NFL\u2019s veteran star quarterbacks suffered injuries Sunday that left them looking on from the sidelines.\n\nIn an afternoon game, Drew Brees hurt the thumb on his passing hand in the first quarter and watched as Teddy Bridgewater took over the New Orleans Saints offense against the Los Angeles Rams. Earlier in the day, Pittsburgh\u2019s Ben Roethlisberger became a spectator when he hurt his elbow in the first quarter of the Steelers\u2019 28-26 loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nBrees was injured on rather innocuous-looking contact when Aaron Donald hit his hand on a pass-rush play. He immediately came out of the game and stood on the sideline with his hand and thumb taped. (Early in the second quarter, Donald left the NFC championship game rematch with a back injury.)\n\nThis is the play where #Saints QB Drew Brees got injured.pic.twitter.com/GyQcKC0EAW \u2014 Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) September 15, 2019\n\nDrew Brees says he hurt his thumb on the pass attempt to Jared Cook & that he hit it on Aaron Donald. Says he is seeing the hand specialist in LA today. Adds he is concerned and that it could be significant. \u2014 ig: josinaanderson (@JosinaAnderson) September 16, 2019\n\nBrees had completed three of five passes for 38 yards and was intercepted once.\n\nESPN reported that Roethlisberger had been dealing with elbow inflammation last week. He is expected to have an MRI on the elbow.\n\nHere's a video of the Ben Roethlisberger injury.pic.twitter.com/PsP1Z1Rhxy \u2014 Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) September 15, 2019\n\nRoethlisberger showed his injury more clearly, shaking his arm and clenching and unclenching his fist. But nothing helped and he gave way to Mason Rudolph. Roethlisberger had completed 8 of 15 passes for 75 yards.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nFor the first time in his career, Aaron Rodgers is wearing a play sheet on his wrist\n\nWho\u2019s Gardner Minshew II?
