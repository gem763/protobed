For people coming from a non-finance background, the account is a way into a previously unknown world.\n\nThis account is the perfect entry into understanding obscure finance terms and office dynamics.\n\nStarter packs are a popular format in these industry accounts as a way to laugh at stereotypes from inside finance.\n\nThey get even more specific: for example, breaking down different types of finance bros.\n\nThe types of finfluencers are endless.\n\nBart Fuchz is character invented for social media as another finance archetype. He lives in Connecticut and works on Wall Street.\n\nHe's a managing director, the bosses who finfluencers love to make fun of.\n\n\"As a junior, you're like, 'Man, my boss is quite a character,'\" the anonymous curator of the @liquidity Instagram account, which has 175,000 followers and is run by an anonymous person who claims to be an employee at a large financial institution, told Institutional Investor.\n\nThe entire @thisguyfuchz account is dedicated to making fun of managing directors, or MDs.\n\nHe's known for having trouble with conference calls.\n\nIn the meme world, MDs are notorious for working junior employees into the ground while doing little work themselves.\n\nThe @Litquidity account also makes fun of how people pronounce finance terms, either correctly or incorrectly.\n\nHow a job in finance can age you is another topic of memery.\n\nNot even your lunch is safe. For example, Chipotle is the true neutral lunch option, according to this midtown lunch chart.\n\nAccounts like @liquidity will probably continue to gain followers as spinoff accounts grow and become more popular.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "A popular Instagram account @litquidity gives us a glimpse into life on Wall Street through \"Finmemes\" using starter packs and alignment charts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7815/600f04f6d20d4480bebe81c44e1fad43.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-15"}
