It\u2019s one of those soft, packable jackets that\u2019s perfect as-is for chilly days and ideal for layering in truly frigid weather. Puffers have their distinct look due to their baffles, the stitched tubes of fabric into which is tucked the down or synthetic fill that provides your insulation.\n\nWhile puffers are generally pretty great at keeping you warm, they often don\u2019t age well. Over time, the fill in those baffles gets packed down and tends to creep off to one side of the tube or the other, creating cold spots and looking\u2026 lumpy. Not a great look.\n\nSo how about a jacket with all the warmth, softness, flexibility, and packability of a puffer that has neither the puffiness nor the problems those puffy baffles create? Does that sound good? Then it sounds like you, too, need an Eddie Bauer EverTherm Dow Jacket like the one I was wearing when I started this review but that is now on the floor near me because I got way too hot.\n\nThe designers of the EverTherm jacket replaced the standard practice of filling quilted baffling with insulation and instead created thin sheets of a fabric imbued with down, a thin down fabric they call\u2026 Thindown. Yeah. Work smarter, not harder, right?\n\nThe result of this new approach to insulation is a jacket with a smooth exterior, plenty of flexibility, the ability to pack down plenty small, and completely even warming. The lack of stitching running all around the exterior also means superior windchill resistance and even makes the jacket more water-resistant. And for those of you who just don\u2019t like the puffer look, now you can have the puffer warmth, no puff involved. | Shop at Eddie Bauer >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
