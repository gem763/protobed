Finally, we are to see the end of an intolerable scandal,\" Dr Irene Frachon, a pulmonologist credited with lifting the lid on the side effects, told Reuters news agency.\n\nDr Frachon's research drew on medical records across France and concluded that there was a clear pattern of heart valve problems among Mediator users. This prompted many more studies which ultimately led to the drug's ban.\n\nOne study concluded that 500 deaths could be linked to Mediator between 1976 and 2009. A second one put the figure at 2,000.\n\nThose numbers have been disputed by Servier, which has said that there are only three documented cases where death can be clearly attributed to the use of Mediator. In other cases, it says, aggravating factors were at work.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Irene Frachon's research concluded a pattern of heart problems among Mediator users\n\nServier has said it will continue to compensate victims and has paid almost \u20ac132m to patients.\n\n\"There is a series of circumstances highlighting how all this took place,\" a lawyer for the drug company told Reuters.\n\nSeveral European countries, like Spain and Italy, banned the drug in the early 2000s.\n\nBased on a molecule called benfluorex, Mediator was first developed in 1976 as a lipopenic - a drug to lower fat levels in the blood.\n\nLater, it was prescribed to diabetics to help them lose weight.\n\nBut as its appetite-suppressant properties were recognised, family doctors began offering Mediator as a general treatment. Anyone worried about putting on the pounds could be offered a course of the drug - even though legally it was authorised for diabetics alone.\n\nBy the time it was taken off the market, it is believed that some five million people had taken Mediator, making it among the 50 most-prescribed drugs in France.", "description": "Experts believe the drug could have killed between 500 and 2,000 people before it was banned.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1595B/production/_108911488_gettyimages-108339205.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
