I\u2019m proud and happy to have made my City debut as I\u2019m not only a player, I\u2019m a fan.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI spoke to my granddad Glyn before and he just said 'Listen, everyone has to do it, so just go out and do what you do'.\n\n\u201cI went out and did the best I can. Hopefully Mike is watching down and is proud of me, because I\u2019ve done it for him as well.\n\n\u201cHe did it in a different era and for me to continue the Doyle legacy in a different one is a massive thing.\n\n\u201cSince he died, I\u2019ve always wanted to make him proud, so I\u2019ll keep my head down, listen to all the information I can get and see how far I can go.\u201d\n\nPardoe, 73, was at the Etihad Stadium to watch his grandson make his City debut \u2013 a milestone he achieved three years earlier in 1962, at the age of 15.\n\n\u201cI face-timed him before the game and told him I couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d said Doyle. \u201cHe reminded me he was only 15, just getting a little dig in!\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cHe does that all the time, we have a nice healthy competition.\n\n\u201cBut he's a legend at this club and I\u2019m fortunate to have him in my family.\u201d\n\nDoyle was just 11 when Sergio Aguero scored his last-gasp winner on the last day of the 2011-12 season to pip local rivals Manchester United to the title.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been coming here for years, but the main memory is the Aguero moment, the 93:20,\u201d said Doyle.\n\n\u201cThat was the moment that changed everything for the club and put us where we are now.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m giving passes to Sergio and it doesn\u2019t seem real. He\u2019s a fantastic footballer and gives you lots of information, but keeps it fun, keeps it happy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always laughing and joking, which helps calm you down and make you feel better.\n\n\u201cEveryone went mental on that day and to be playing with him is amazing.\n\n\u201cAs I walked out of the tunnel, the seat I was in that day is straight ahead.\n\n\u201cIt was the first thing I looked at, then I looked at my family in the stands and I was ready.\u201d", "description": "The 18-year-old Sky Blues starlet is the grandson of Sky Blues legends Mike Doyle and Glyn Pardoe", "authors": ["David Mcdonnell", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20756357.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1184243328.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
