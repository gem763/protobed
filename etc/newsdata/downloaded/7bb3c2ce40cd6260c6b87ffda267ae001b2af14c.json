We have a winner of the Not the Booker Prize. Our judges, after diligently reading all the books, and sharing their thoughts and ideas throughout the process, have unanimously decided that the award should go to Supper Club by Lara Williams. This feels like a fantastic choice to me. It\u2019s a superb debut novel from a writer bursting with talent. She has a great deal to say about our common humanity and the world we live in. Plus, this novel is hilariously funny and deeply moving. I\u2019m delighted.\n\nSecond: the small print. In selecting Supper Club, the judges overruled the public vote and The Unauthorised Biography of Ezra Maas by Daniel James.\n\nFor the record here\u2019s how the voting played out:\n\nThe Unauthorised Biography of Ezra Maas: 98\n\nPlease Read This Leaflet Carefully: 24\n\nSkin: 22\n\nFlames: 10\n\nSpring: 9\n\nSupper Club: 5\n\nThe judges all saw positive qualities in The Unauthorised Biography of Ezra Maas, but despite its thumping victory in the public vote the novel didn\u2019t speak to them enough. They were also irritated by aspects of its meta-fictional architecture, and when Hilary Shepherd said, \u201cIt felt like reading a cartoon\u201d, I think she summed up the general consensus. Our judges have carefully weighed all the books and it\u2019s their right to position them accordingly. I know that some people who voted find this part of the process painful \u2013 and if that\u2019s you, I\u2019d like to encourage you to join in. Read all of the books and maybe you can become a judge next year. It\u2019s also worth noting that your vote wasn\u2019t wasted. If only one judge had sided with Maas, it could have won through. It was the second choice for at least one of the judges, so it was close \u2026\n\nThird: phew! Ha! Wow. We had some gremlins. If you scan through the comments below this blog you will see that we were unable to broadcast the judging meeting as we have done in the past. Oh well. Richard Lea stepped in and recorded the conversation in the comments as it happened \u2013 you can track it there.\n\nFourth: hey! In spite of the last-minute gremlins (and it wouldn\u2019t be the Not the Booker, without a small dose of chaos) it\u2019s felt like a great year. We had a really strong shortlist. All of the books had excellent qualities, the discussions were vibrant and fascinating, and we\u2019ve shone the spotlight on some very talented writers.\n\nFifth: onwards! We may have just completed our eleventh year, but the Not the Booker is still a work-in-progress. Our quest for openness, inclusivity and excellence is bound to produce issues. Part of the point of the whole process is to discuss the wider nature of prize culture, what we value about books and how awards decisions are made. Think of it as warts and all, with extra discussion of the warts. In that spirit, send along constructive criticism and ideas for refinement. The decision to approach the excellent Storyhouse library and Edinburgh\u2019s Golden Hare Books was inspired by a reader\u2019s suggestion, and it worked very well. In fact, it helped us find our winner. So more of that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSixth: thank you. I\u2019m grateful to our excellent judges, Kate White, Hilary Shepherd and Heather Curran, as well as everyone who took part this year, helped get some fine books on to our shortlist, generated controversy and talked about literature, the thing we love.\n\nSeventh: that\u2019s it! It\u2019s been a blast. Congratulations again to Lara Williams, a very worthy winner.
