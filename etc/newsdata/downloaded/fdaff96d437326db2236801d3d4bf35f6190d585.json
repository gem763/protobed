The Internet, social media, politics, social mores, and public discourse on race and gender have altered dramatically; sketch comedy has not only reflected that, but has also helped propel those changes forward.\n\nI set out to make a list of 20 defining sketches that captured this sea change, starting with the year 2000. For the purposes of this list, \u201cdefining\u201d does not mean the \u201cbest\u201d sketches, or even objectively funny ones. What we find funny rapidly evolves, and not all jokes can stand the test of time.\n\n\u201cDefining\u201d can be a nebulous descriptor, but let\u2019s try to give some form to it: Which sketches helped alter sketch comedy itself? Which exemplified or popularized a certain kind of comedic sensibility? What permeated our shared psyche or charted a new way through changing media?\n\nTo qualify, here are some ground rules: Sketches had to involve characters in a short vignette that was written and plotted out, rather than improvised. They must have been televised. (Sorry, I\u2019m not combing through the graveyard of Vine for content to judge.) They had to come from American shows.\n\nThe final list, which is in no particular order, includes sketches you\u2019ve seen, ones you haven\u2019t and a lot of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014 the natural outcome of being the longest-running and most widely watched sketch series. Yes, your favorite bit may be missing.\n\nThroughout comedy\u2019s evolution, sketches have held a prominent place within our culture. They can still give us a new shared language for the mundane. They can allow us to process the serious or painful aspects of our existence. Or, they can simply make us laugh.\n\nNote: Some of the clips include vulgar language and content.\n\nSNL\n\n\u201cMore Cowbell\u201d (2000)\n\nIf we had to explain to future generations how things went \u201cviral\u201d before that word was associated with anything but a contagious disease, we might point to this 2000 SNL sketch about Blue Oyster Cult\u2019s \u201c(Don\u2019t Fear) The Reaper.\u201d It\u2019s very weird and non-topical, but it somehow managed to infect us all. For years after, its legacy followed around the real-life band, who had to deal with fans at shows yelling for more \u2014 ha ha, get it! \u2014 cowbell. Will Ferrell\u2019s physical comedy \u2014 his too-small shirt creeping up his belly as he wildly struck his humble instrument \u2014 and Christopher Walken\u2019s, well, Walken-esque delivery may have sold the sketch. However, two lines in particular \u2014 \u201cI need more cowbell\u201d and \u201cI got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell!\u201d \u2014 took over our brains and still hasn\u2019t let go. (People are still out here in 2019 putting \u201ccowbell\u201d jokes on their dating profiles.) Somehow, we all knew to laugh at this, tell each other about it and repeat the lines over and over, without the digital public square of Facebook and Twitter.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\nSNL\n\n\u201cLazy Sunday\u201d (2005)\n\nThis music video may be more Weird Al than classic sketch comedy, but what \u201cLazy Sunday\u201d accomplished secures its place on this list. When the rap by Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell first aired in 2005, TV was still being made with just TV in mind and YouTube was but a few months old. Their \u201cdigital short\u201d first blazed what is now a well-worn path for sketch comedy, becoming one of the first bits from television that found a second life online, amassing millions of views within days. After NBC raised a fuss to get the YouTube clip taken down, people posted ripped versions. Regular people made their own parody versions in a harbinger of viral challenges to come. \u201cLazy Sunday\u201d was asking for it: Its hardcore beat and lyrics that so ludicrously contrast with a sweet premise (how to enjoy a lazy Sunday) were irresistible. \u201cThe Office\u2019s\u201d Michael Scott even made his own Scranton, Pa.-specific version.\n\n\u201cLazy Sunday\u201d also raised the profile of comedy-factory the Lonely Island (made up of Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer), and set a precedent for infectious SNL song parodies that became instant viral sensations, such as the Emmy Award-winning \u201cD--- in a Box\u201d and the rap Grammy-nominated \u201cI\u2019m on a Boat.\u201d\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d\n\n\u201cFrontline \u2014 Clayton Bigsby\u201d (2003)\n\nDave Chappelle\u2019s presentation of a black white supremacist remains a fixture of popular culture, still embedded in our public consciousness more than 15 years after it first aired. When Spike Lee first heard the pitch for \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d \u2014 the 2018 movie based on a real story about a black cop infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan in the \u201970s \u2014 he thought it was a remake of the sketch.\n\n\u201cClayton Bigsby\u201d was inspired by a different, real event as \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d co-creator Neal Brennan has previously explained: After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Chappelle\u2019s mixed-race, blind grandfather boarded a bus in Washington, a city that was engulfed with riots. Chappelle\u2019s grandfather overheard passengers talking about beating up a white guy before he realized: Oh wait, I\u2019m that white guy. The notion of a black man unaware of his blackness was then taken to its extreme on the first episode of \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show.\u201d\n\nThe premise is outrageous, as Chappelle plays a blind, black KKK member who thinks he is white. The n-word is said by white people \u2014 repeatedly. There are layers of jokes and an unforgettable exploding head. When Chappelle introduced the sketch on air, he told the audience that a friend had already watched it and said it set back the progress of black people. Chappelle laughed about it then, but it was, and remains, a complex question: How does one consider the audience when walking the line between skewering and perpetuating racism? It is a question that would also be at the heart of Chappelle\u2019s decision a few years later to walk away from the wildly successful Comedy Central series.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here and here.\n\n\u201cKey & Peele\u201d\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s Anger Translator\u201d (2012)\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama brings out actor Keegan-Michael Key from \"Key & Peele\" to play the part of Luther, the president's \"anger translator,\" during his remarks at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner in 2015 in Washington. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nSNL usually leads the pack for political sketch comedy, but it didn\u2019t do many memorable pieces during the Obama presidency. \u201cKey & Peele,\u201d however, peppered its shows with some of the most cutting and unique societal commentary during the era of the first black president, including the \u201cAnger Translator\u201d sketches.\n\nThe recurring sketch featured Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cno drama Obama,\u201d as he was called during his presidency, having to keep his cool in public, so he enlists the services of an anger translator, Luther (Keegan-Michael Key). When people such as Donald Trump circulated the conspiracy theory that Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States, or when Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) yelled \u201cyou lie!\u201d during Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, the real-life Obama \u201ccouldn\u2019t come off like an angry black man, especially early on, so what Luther says are things that ring true to us, and we felt like we were giving the truth a voice in a lot of ways,\u201d Peele explained to NPR in 2013.\n\nEvery sketch features Peele\u2019s pitch-perfect Obama impression, calmly discussing the matters before him, and then Key\u2019s Luther yells and lets loose. Luther punctuated pivotal moments in Obama\u2019s presidency, such as in a victory sketch that was posted online before Mitt Romney uttered a word of his concession speech. Luther also stood alongside the real Obama as he gave a speech at the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner in 2015.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d\n\n\u201cCharlie Murphy\u2019s True Hollywood Stories \u2014 Rick James\u201d (2004)\n\nThis sketch did many things. It put \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d on the map; revived Rick James\u2019s career, giving him newfound relevance after years away from the spotlight; and spawned a catchphrase that would dog Chappelle for years. The comedian heard, \u201cI\u2019m Rick James, bitch!\u201d everywhere, with hecklers ruining his stand-up performances and even family trips. (During a visit to Disney World, people bombarded Chappelle with the phrase. \u201cHey man, hey,\u201d Chappelle quipped during his 2004 stand-up special. \u201cYou mind not calling me a bitch in front of my kids?\u201d)\n\nThe sketch was silly and unpredictable, featuring Charlie Murphy telling an apparently true story about partying with the singer in the 1980s. (Murphy also told a story about Prince in a different memorable sketch.) Chappelle portrayed an outrageous young James, and the \u201cSuper Freak\u201d himself gave his side of the events and described his behavior with a now-classic line: \u201cCocaine is a hell of a drug.\u201d\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here and here.\n\nSNL\n\n\u201cDebbie Downer\u201d (2004)\n\nIt can feel cheap to get laughs from breaking in a sketch, as Liz Lemon explains on \u201c30 Rock,\u201d but sometimes the chaos of seasoned performers breaking so intensely can be transcendent. Rachel Dratch introduced us to her Debbie Downer character in this sketch, which made a murderers\u2019 row of comedians laugh so severely that there was no use in hiding it. Horatio Sanz used a waffle to wipe away his tears. The cast reportedly didn\u2019t know there would be a sad trombone sound after Debbie said super depressing stuff, which is what kicked off the cascade of onstage laughs. What followed from that moment felt like a shared experience between cast and audience, one that\u2019s just as resonant today as it was when it first aired. \u201cI still believe that sketch may be a cure for low-level depression if watched regularly,\u201d Amy Poehler, one of its stars, wrote in her autobiography.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\nSNL\n\n\u201cBlack Jeopardy With Tom Hanks\u201d (2016)\n\nMaking funny and unique political sketches during Trump\u2019s campaign and presidency has been a challenge: The humor is often predictable, and the subject matter of the jokes, fleeting. This edition of \u201cBlack Jeopardy,\u201d which aired on the eve of the 2016 presidential election, stands as one of the best examples of recent political sketch comedy.\n\nThe fake game show quizzes contestants on aspects of black culture. In this version, Tom Hanks plays a rural, white, MAGA-hat-wearing voter, and to the surprise of everyone, turns out to have a lot in common with the two black contestants on the show. The sketch managed to offer timely, funny and incisive political commentary without a single Trump impersonation, and it spawned think-pieces about how voters are depicted by the media. \u201cIt had more to say about class and race than a thousand tenderly crafted portraits of the white working class,\u201d wrote one prominent political columnist. It also achieved another rare feat in a hyper-polarized time: Both conservatives and liberals found it funny.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cMADtv\u201d\n\n\u201cMs. Swan\u201d (2002)\n\nNo one is really basking in \u201cMs. Swan\u201d nostalgia. These days, the sketches featuring the recurring character mostly get sent around to prove a point about the kind of \u201cproblematic\u201d stuff TV networks used to air.\n\nFox\u2019s \u201cMADtv\u201d tried to give \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d a run for its money by showcasing a different kind of comedic taste. It had a more diverse cast than SNL, and it focused heavily on pop culture parodies. The \u201cMs. Swan\u201d sketches, among the most widely remembered of \u201cMADtv\u2019s\u201d work, were also a harbinger of future debates over comedy and representation. (Sound familiar?)\n\nAlex Borstein, who has Hungarian, Mongolian, Russian and Polish roots, wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed that her character, who hailed from the fictional country of Kuvaria, was based on her own \u201cspunky\u201d grandmother, \u201can immigrant who toys with her ability to speak and understand English as it suits her.\u201d Ms. Swan was \u201can amalgamation of many nationalities,\u201d but many people saw, and still see, Ms. Swan as a stereotypical Asian lady with an exaggerated accent \u2014 an example of the sort of \u201cedgy\u201d comedy from the early aughts that more overtly trafficked in racial stereotypes.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cKroll Show\u201d\n\n\u201cToo Much Tuna\u201d (2013)\n\n\n\nJohn Mulaney and Nick Kroll on \"Kroll Show.\" (Luke Fontana)\n\nLike starting a food truck before opening a restaurant, a comedy sketch can be a manageable testing ground for a much grander pursuit. The comedy sketch to movie evolution has been done over and over, but the sketch to Broadway performance to Netflix special? \u201cToo Much Tuna\u201d blazed a different kind of path. Nick Kroll and John Mulaney had performed as Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland around New York before, but \u201cKroll Show\u201d brought the septuagenarians\u2019 fake public-access prank show before a national audience. The platform gave the duo enough juice to sell out a five-month run of their play, \u201cOh, Hello on Broadway.\u201d That production also helped Mulaney rebound after his failed sitcom: He\u2019s now a bigger star than ever, selling out a week of shows at Radio City Music Hall and winning an Emmy for his acclaimed \u201cKid Gorgeous\u201d stand-up special.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d\n\n\u201cLast F---able Day\u201d (2015)\n\nSometimes a sketch is the best vehicle to articulate a phenomenon that\u2019s so pervasive and long-standing that it\u2019s just the wallpaper to our culture. Amy Schumer managed to nab three massive stars to play themselves in this sketch, and each delivers a pitch-perfect performance. Tina Fey, Patricia Arquette and Julia Louis-Dreyfus have all gathered in a picturesque meadow to celebrate the last day \u201cVeep\u201d star Louis-Dreyfus is considered romantic-lead material by the entertainment industry. \u201cYou know how Sally Field was Tom Hanks\u2019s love interest in \u2018Punchline,\u2019 and then like 20 minutes later, she was his mom in \u2018Forrest Gump?\u2019 \u201d Louis-Dreyfus notes. The women let loose, both figuratively and literally (yes, there is a fart), as they joke about ageism and the double standard that women in Hollywood face. Remember, this was before #TimesUp inclusion-rider Oscar speeches.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cKey & Peele\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstitute Teacher\u201d (2012)\n\nThis sketch, which almost became a movie, helped secure \u201cKey & Peele\u2019s\u201d place as the purveyor of outlandish yet relatable and subversive comedy. Key\u2019s Mr. Garvey, an instructor from the inner city who is a substitute teacher in an all-white classroom, is a flip of the white-teacher-inner-city classroom trope. Mr. Garvey has trouble taking attendance with ridiculous, hard-to-pronounce names such as \u201cAaron\u201d and \u201cBlake.\u201d (\u201cA-a-ron, where are you?\u201d) The comedy duo hadn\u2019t planned to post the sketch online for whatever reason, but it blew up when they did. The sketch is highly quotable, having a substitute teacher is a universal experience, and it\u2019s the perfect clip to send to anyone who has one of the names Mr. Garvey butchers. Seven years later, the humor still holds up, and \u201cSubstitute Teacher\u201d stands as Comedy Central\u2019s most-viewed YouTube video, amassing some 175 million views and counting. As Peele said in an interview with the Week, \u201cIt\u2019s taught us a lot about how the Internet works.\u201d\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\nSNL\n\n\u201cFirst Presidential Debate: Al Gore and George W. Bush\u201d (2000)\n\nElection years are SNL\u2019s bread and butter. The sketch show has a long, storied history of shaping the public perception of various political figures. Perhaps nowhere did that happen more than with George W. Bush and Al Gore, specifically with this sketch. The spoof of their presidential debate set the stage for Will Ferrell\u2019s impersonation of Bush as a dimwitted yet lovable guy that many have argued made the real Bush much more likable. After it aired, cable news programs replayed the sketch over and over, multiplying its effect: Gore\u2019s aides reportedly showed him Darrell Hammond\u2019s portrayal to help the vice president for his second debate, and a senior adviser has said the sketch hurt Gore\u2019s campaign. While the references may be dated now, the terms the sketch birthed \u2014 \u201cstrategery\u201d and \u201clockbox\u201d \u2014 still get bandied about in political analysis.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cKey & Peele\u201d\n\n\u201cContinental Breakfast\u201d (2013)\n\nThis sketch gives us a glimmer of the genre-bending that was to come from Peele, a sketch comedian who would go on to win an Oscar while reviving horror as a prestige genre and sparking a conversation over what makes a comedy a comedy. In it, a traveler rabidly enjoying a complimentary continental breakfast goofily indulges in muffins, cereal and yogurt, backed by the music of Strauss, and exclaims, \u201cI love being in continent!\u201d It could have ended on the pure joy, but it takes a hard turn. Peele\u2019s character eventually breaks into tears and the bit ends on a spooky note, with a callback to the final scene in \u201cThe Shining.\u201d (It also hints at themes of psychological imprisonment, potentially an early iteration of the \u201cthe sunken place\u201d that would be explored further in \u201cGet Out.\u201d) The old-timey photograph shown at the end of the sketch would later hang in Peele\u2019s offices. And, after making hundreds of sketches, winning prestigious awards and making two films, it is this photograph \u2014 specifically, the close-up of Peele\u2019s frozen-in-time character \u2014 that is his Twitter avatar, serving as his public face to the world.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cI Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson\u201d\n\n\u201cFocus Group\u201d (2019)\n\nIt would seem that streaming services, without the same kind of time and content limitations as regular TV, would be perfect for sketches, but few have risen above the fray and turned into mini pop-culture wonders. Enter the \u201cFocus Group\u201d sketch, a prime example of how sketch can thrive in a post-cable and network TV world. The premise: A focus group brainstorms their dream features for a car, during which an older male participant keeps hammering his point: The car should have \u201ca good steering wheel that doesn\u2019t fly off while you\u2019re driving.\u201d He\u2019s totally out there, with a distinct haircut (bald, but with long hair?) and an accent that\u2019s difficult to place. But the sketch takes an unpredictable turn away from \u201chere\u2019s a weird guy with bad ideas\u201d when the others in the focus group stop reacting to him like he\u2019s crazy and join him in making fun of another guy, Paul. What is this sketch even about? Who cares. It\u2019s so zany and delightful, with a plethora of memorable sound bites (\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea and I stand by\u201d) that can be adapted to numerous scenarios \u2014 and, fittingly, have been turned into a bunch of memes.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d\n\n\u201c12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer\u201d (2015)\n\nIt seems a distant memory, but Schumer\u2019s show \u2014 which came before she turned into a movie star and a somewhat divisive celebrity \u2014 was highly celebrated, and this episode-long sketch shows why. The highly stylized black-and-white parody spoofs the 1957 courtroom drama\u201c12 Angry Men,\u201d except in this case, the jurors have to decide whether Schumer is hot enough for TV. The sketch has so many stars in it that just as you get a handle of your shock over one (Jeff Goldblum), here comes another (Paul Giamatti). The cinematography is excellent, and John Hawkes delivers an award-worthy acting performance as he makes serious arguments and slowly convinces his fellow jurors that Schumer, indeed, is hot enough. Along the way, we get to hear jokes about the double standards women encounter. The entire sketch was a risk \u2014 how many Comedy Central viewers have even seen the movie? \u2014 but the attempt at high lowbrow humor became a big hit. And for this season, Schumer would go on to win the Emmy for outstanding variety sketch series in the first year of the category.\n\nTo watch part of the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cThe Amanda Show\u201d\n\n\u201cJudge Trudy\u201d (2002)\n\n\n\nAmanda Bynes as Judge Trudy on \"The Amanda Show.\" (Nickelodeon)\n\nSadly, because of the time parameters we set, most sketches from the iconic children\u2019s show \u201cAll That\u201d don\u2019t qualify for this list. So, we\u2019ve reserved this spot for one of its inheritors. \u201cThe Amanda Show\u201d was among a slew of sketch comedy series that starred and targeted kids. At the time, Amanda Bynes was considered a comedy prodigy, and her \u201cJudge Judy\u201d parody sketches always ended with a bizarre, out-of-nowhere twist: dancing lobsters. It\u2019s so out there and incongruent with the rest of the sketch, but it must have seeped into a young generation\u2019s comedic temperament. We see it today via the absurdist, nihilistic humor millennials use on Twitter. Those dancing lobsters were the prelude to the break-dancing hot dog hanging with Soviet-era icons.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Racial Draft\u201d (2004)\n\nThis sketch first aired in 2004, but the premise \u2014 that races could have delegations draft new members for their groups, much like in the NBA or NFL \u2014 still resonates, as every so often, the joke comes back up on social media as people argue over fictional trades. During the seven-minute Chappelle sketch, Lenny Kravitz is drafted by the Jewish delegation, Tiger Woods gets drafted by the black delegation and the same representative gives away Condoleezza Rice to the white team. There are cameos from \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d favorites Mos Def (now known as Yasiin Bey) and the Wu-Tang Clan, who get drafted by the Asian delegation. It\u2019s outrageous and silly, but it\u2019s also a cutting examination of racial identity.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cPortlandia\u201d\n\n\u201cPut a Bird On It\u201d (2011)\n\nOne of the clearest signs that a comedy sketch has made a dent is when people start saying its signature line. Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein turned the mundane into the magical by simply slapping images of birds on various objects and exclaiming, \u201cPut a bird on it!\u201d After this, you saw bird patterns on dresses (and \u201cPortlandia\u201d references) everywhere as the show became a pioneer in how to make fun of distinct \u201chipster\u201d habits. The vibe of this sketch, which aired in the show\u2019s first episode, would set the tone for how the series approached comedy: with highly specific settings and characters who seemed normal but turned weird, all of whom were recognizable to you \u2014 even if you had never been to Portland and asked about farm-raised chicken.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\n\u201cRobot Chicken\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s Phone Call\u201d (2013)\n\n\u201cRobot Chicken\u201d emerged during that strange time when entertainment companies were figuring out how to make TV for the Web. Sony\u2019s Web streaming service, Screenblast.com, developed and first aired the stop-motion sketch series. Adult Swim picked it up, turning it into one of Cartoon Network\u2019s staple programs and, eventually, into one of its longest-running shows. The series specialized in skewering pop culture and indulging in more nostalgic touchstones, such as in this particular Star Wars sketch, which is among its most widely known. In it, Darth Vader calls Emperor Palpatine to report that the Death Star has been destroyed, and Palpatine is just an exasperated boss who puts Vader on hold so he can order a turkey club for lunch. Star Wars creator George Lucas saw the sketch, and two years later, LucasFilms participated in an entire episode dedicated to the space franchise, involving the real-life Lucas as well as Luke Skywalker actor Mark Hamill; it was nominated for an Emmy. The entire series showed that Internet sensibilities could be adapted for a regular TV audience, who would, in turn, memeify televised sketches.\n\nTo watch the sketch, click here.\n\nSNL\n\n\u201cSarah Palin and Hillary Address the Nation\u201d (2008)\n\nSo much of comedy is about timing. When all of the stars align so perfectly, you end up with this sketch. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d maven Fey had two very different lives until they intersected in this sketch, for which Palin \u2014 I mean, Fey \u2014 won an Emmy. Yes, it\u2019s uncanny that Fey is essentially Palin\u2019s doppelganger, but the performance went beyond, \u201cWow, they look alike!\u201d The sketch birthed a catchphrase \u2014 \u201cI can see Russia from my house!\u201d \u2014 that was, and still is, misattributed to the former Republican vice presidential candidate. (The real-life Palin said, \u201cYou can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska.\u201d) The approach of this sketch showed how to poke fun at an unconventional candidate. This was a time when repeating a slight variation of a politician\u2019s own words in a comedy sketch was all you needed to do to devastatingly make fun of them.
