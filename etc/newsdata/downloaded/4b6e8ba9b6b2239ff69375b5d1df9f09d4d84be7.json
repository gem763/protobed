Whether the fault lies with the OS or the manufacturing (or both), I\u2019ve found that most headphones \u2014 even expensive ones like the Sony WH-1000X M3s \u2014 aren\u2019t able to keep up with what\u2019s on the screen. It\u2019s infuriating, and it\u2019s a situation that Razer\u2019s $99 Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds aim to take on.\n\nThese new truly wireless earbuds, which Razer announced today, have a minuscule 60ms latency once \u201cGaming Mode\u201d is enabled via a dedicated app for iOS and Android. The result should align what you\u2019re hearing with what is on the screen. Razer claims that its earbuds utilize a customized version of Bluetooth 5.0 to allow this feature to work and to preserve audio quality and battery life in the low-latency mode. To turn it on, just tap three times on the earbud.\n\nRelated The best wireless earbuds to buy in 2019\n\nAt a press briefing, I got to try out the Hammerhead True Wireless, and this low-latency mode seemed to work at times while falling out of step other times. My time with the earbuds was brief, and the press room was loud, so I won\u2019t be able to place final judgment on the quality of the feature (or the sound quality, in general) until I have more time with them.\n\nThe Hammerhead True Wireless are somewhat similar in design to the AirPods in that they don\u2019t rely on ear tips to fit in your ears, though they include a few silicon sleeves to help you find a better fit. Once you pop them out of the case, which charges via USB-C, they rest in your ears. This is great from a usability standpoint, but it\u2019s not so great if you\u2019re looking for a set of wireless earbuds that can block out external noise. If that\u2019s the case, something like the AirPods Pro might be a better choice.\n\nThe Hammerhead True Wireless offer IPX4 water resistance and three hours of use per charge. The included case offers four recharges, totaling 12 hours of battery life. (This is on the low-end of life expectancies per charge compared to other competing models.) Basic tasks like changing the song, picking up calls, or activating your preferred voice assistant are handled with touch controls on the earbuds. If you want to adjust the volume, you\u2019ll need to do it from your phone.\n\nThe $99 price tag seems fair for what\u2019s being offered, but these earbuds might have a tough time standing out from the crowd if the Gaming Mode doesn\u2019t make a huge difference when you\u2019re gaming on an Android phone. We will test them more to find out if the low-latency mode makes or breaks these earbuds.
