If those goods remained in the UK \u2013 with lower tariffs \u2013 companies could then claim back the difference.\n\nThe new version would, it appears, apply to Northern Ireland only, creating an administrative barrier in the Irish Sea.\n\nMr Johnson himself urged caution, adding: \u201cI had a good conversation with the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar yesterday and I think both of us can see a pathway to a deal, but that doesn't mean it's a done deal.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, key manufacturers have warned of a \u201cserious risk\u201d in Mr Johnson\u2019s new proposals, which also break with Ms May by planning to diverge further from EU arrangements.\n\nThe bodies representing carmakers, chemicals, the food and drink industry, aerospace, and pharmaceutical \u2013 1.1m workers in total \u2013 fear rising costs if the UK quits the relevant EU agencies.\n\nSignificantly, the organisations had previously criticised only the risk of a no-deal Brexit, having accepted Ms May\u2019s withdrawal agreement.", "description": "Boris Johnson has hinted at a major concession to the EU to rescue a Brexit deal by refusing to say that Northern Ireland would leave the customs union.", "authors": ["Rob Merrick"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/15/Boris.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
