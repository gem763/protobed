He\u2019s either a petulant diva or a mastermind who orchestrated a never-before-seen string of drama to land on the New England Patriots, depending what you believe.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nDon\u2019t worry, Ben Roethlisberger is sick of it too.\n\nBen Roethlisberger doesn\u2019t want to talk about Antonio Brown\n\nRoethlisberger was all of us when he was asked about Brown landing on the Patriots after the Steelers\u2019 33-3 loss on Sunday night.\n\nReporter: \"Ben, your thoughts on Antonio Brown joining these guys now?\"\n\n\n\nBen Roethlisberger: \"Whatever.\" pic.twitter.com/vSziIW3oTz \u2014 ESPN (@espn) September 9, 2019\n\nThough, we know it\u2019s not just \u201cwhatever,\u201d as Ben said. It really is a big deal. If Brown can just play football (and this is far from a sure thing after all we\u2019ve seen this summer), the Patriots might be unbeatable.\n\nStill, that Roethsliberger clip should sum up everyone\u2019s feelings pretty well. You can\u2019t blame him after Brown has taken shots at Roethlisberger through the offseason.\n\n\u2018Please don\u2019t ever ask me about him again\u2019\n\nRoethlisberger wasn\u2019t the only one asked about Brown, who is the biggest story in the NFL right now. Bill Belichick refused to answer any Brown questions, because the transaction couldn\u2019t be official until Monday.\n\nSteelers guard Ramon Foster was more verbose than Roethlisberger but had the same approach.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t ever ask me about him again,\u201d Foster said, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \u201cI ask that respectfully.\u201d\n\nFoster might not field any more questions on Brown, but Brown\u2019s going to continue to dominate the headlines. Attention is a boomin\u2019 as Brown would say.\n\nAntonio Brown agreed to join the Patriots after being released by the Raiders.
