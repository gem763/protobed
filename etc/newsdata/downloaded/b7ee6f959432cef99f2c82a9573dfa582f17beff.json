Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei applauded Mr. Bolton\u2019s move in a conciliatory post on Twitter.\n\n\u201cMonths ago, #JohnBolton had promised that #Iran would not be there in 3 months; we are still standing & he is gone,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWith the ousting of its biggest proponent of war & economic terrorism, the White House will have fewer obstacles to understanding the realities of Iran.\u201d\n\nSuzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution, said the development significantly increased the odds of Mr. Trump meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations General Assembly gathering this month.\n\n\u201cBolton\u2019s departure may free @POTUS to engage more openly & creatively w/Iranian leaders, presumably they\u2019re ready to make use of the opportunity,\u201d Ms. Maloney wrote on Twitter. However, she added: \u201cOn its own, his removal won\u2019t produce meaningful changes in Trump\u2019s overall approach of maximum pressure.\u201d\n\nBefore Mr. Bolton\u2019s removal, analysts had expressed skepticism any such meeting would take place, saying the U.S. and Iranian negotiating positions were too entrenched to find common ground without losing face.\n\nWhile Mr. Bolton\u2019s exit opens the door to negotiations with Iran, it could worry important U.S. allies in the Middle East that are adversaries of Iran, including Persian Gulf nations and Israel, who believed that the Obama era of greater accommodation with Iran was over, said Danielle Pletka, of the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is it means uncertainty,\u201d Ms. Pletka said. \u201cUncertainty in foreign policy, just like in economics, is not a good thing.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, who made a public appearance at the White House shortly after Mr. Trump announced Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure, played down the possibility that the president\u2019s foreign policy might shift. \u201cI don\u2019t think any leader around the world should make any assumption because one of us departs that the president\u2019s policy would change materially,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\n\nWith the exit of Mr. Bolton, the Trump administration is losing one of its more experienced policy makers. Mr. Bolton\u2019s deputy will fill the job until Mr. Trump appoints a new full-time adviser.\n\nThe vacancy at the National Security Council, which Mr. Bolton headed, occurs at the same time Mr. Trump is trying to find someone to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which has been vacant since Dan Coats resigned in July.\n\nSimilarly, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees a range of U.S. security functions, is headed by an acting director following the resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen in April.\n\nAt the Defense Department, Secretary Mark Esper started work in his post after his Senate confirmation in July, months after the resignation of former Secretary Jim Mattis over differences with Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Pompeo, a key Trump ally, has been in place since 2018, and before that was director of the Central Intelligence Agency. However, he has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the Senate from Kansas, and key lawmakers wouldn\u2019t predict whether Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure would have an effect on his calculations.\n\n\u201cI would guess on the Pompeo side of the equation is that his role in the administration, or his influence, becomes more important,\u201d said Sen. Jerry Moran (R., Kan.). \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for stability you wouldn\u2019t want, in this case, another cabinet member to depart.\u201d\n\n\u2014Alex Leary and Courtney McBride contributed to this article.", "description": "John Bolton\u2019s departure as White House national security adviser makes it more likely President Trump will redouble his personal diplomacy with Iran and other countries and world actors, international officials and foreign policy experts said.", "authors": ["Vivian Salama In Washington", "Isabel Coles In Beirut", "Vivian Salama", "Isabel Coles", "Vivian.Salama Wsj.Com", "Isabel.Coles Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105900/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
