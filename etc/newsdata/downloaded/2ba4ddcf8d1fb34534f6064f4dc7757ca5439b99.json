If Whyte has her way, Tokyo 2020 will be her fourth. But her quest for a \"quad\" has involved some major personal sacrifice.\n\nAfter failing to move past the qualifying round in the Rio 2016 Games, Whyte knew she had a decision to make: hang up her shoes or try to make history with a fourth Olympics.\n\nSo, in 2016, she quit her coaching job in the United States and committed to spend the next four years training. She uprooted her life, relocated to Toronto, and moved in with a roommate \u2014 all in the name of qualifying for Tokyo.\n\nAs I like to say to people, I'm doing this until the wheels fall off.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b - Angela Whyte\n\n\"I thought to myself, this is not the way I want to end my track career. There was something inside that said: 'You're not not done',\" said Whyte.\n\n'Sport favours the young'\n\nCanada's Angela Whyte competes in the heptathlon long jump at Carrara Stadium during the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast, Australia, April 13, 2018. (Dita Alangkara/The Associated Press)\n\nSince 2001, Whyte has represented Canada in dozens of international events \u2014 whether it's the Pan Am Games, the Commonwealth Games or the World Championships in Athletics: you name it, she's been there.\n\nHer long career has also given her a unique perspective on the way the sporting world treats female athletes as they age. At 39, Whyte is more than a decade older than most of her competitors.\n\n\"There's times where organizations I have do deal with wonder when [I'm] just going to retire or be done with it,\" said Whyte. \"Nobody ever wants to explicitly tell you that, but I can feel it. That's what drives me.\"\n\nIt's her drive that has pushed Whyte to take a risk for 2020. For the first time, she's hoping to qualify in two Olympic sports: hurdles and heptathlon.\n\nCanada's Angela Whyte competes in a women's 100-metre hurdles heat during the athletics competitions of the 2016 Summer Olympics at the Olympic stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Aug. 16, 2016. (Lee Jin-man/The Associated Press)\n\nMore training, less savings\n\nWhyte spends her days working out at the Athletics Canada East Hub in Toronto, leaving little room for a part-time job, let alone a full-time career.\n\n\"I'm approaching 40, and at this point many people are building their lives and saving for a home or children. And I'm just eating away at the savings that I had built,\" said Whyte.\n\nUnlike some younger athletes, Whyte no longer has corporate sponsors to help pay the bills. And while she's driven by her Olympic ambitions, Whyte finds it hard to ignore her bank account's dwindling balance.\n\n\"I've decided to sacrifice and try to make things work. It's stressful.\"\n\nNot ready to say goodbye\n\nDespite the metaphorical hurdles that are in her way, Whyte is determined to leap over them.\n\nThrough tears, she explained to Now or Never what it would mean to walk into the Olympic stadium in Tokyo \u2014 even if she doesn't end up earning a medal.\n\n\"It would be the end of an era,\" said Whyte. \"But in the sweetest way. Just to know that I've stuck it out.\"\n\nWhyte knows that her athletic career won't last forever. But making it to Tokyo, she said, would help her leave a world that has given her so much.\n\n\"The people I've been able to meet. The connections that I've made. The things that I've been able to see in myself. It would be sad to have that come to an end. But if I can go out walking through the stadium, that would be a pretty amazing end.\"", "description": "The Canadian hurdler has competed in three Olympic games.
