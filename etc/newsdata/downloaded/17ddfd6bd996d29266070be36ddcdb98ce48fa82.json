The stock has been rallying for most of this month so let's check and see if this uptrend can be sustained.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of AMD, below, we can see two trends. There is a clear uptrend visible from late December with prices doubling in just a few months. We can also see another trend from June where prices have been trading sideways. Prices are up near their July/August highs or the top end the sideways range.\n\nThe $64,000 question is whether the rally so far this month is strong enough to create a breakout. AMD is the rising above the 50-day moving average line and above the rising 200-day line. Notice that prices made a successful test of the rising 200-day moving average line earlier this month. In hindsight that test was a buying opportunity.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) has improved this month and is now very close to a new high for the move up. A new high on the OBV line would tell us that buyers of AMD have been more aggressive and it would give us a good reason to anticipate a breakout from this range.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator just crossed above the zero line for an outright buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of AMD, below, we can see a strengthening picture. Prices are trading above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line started to improve from the middle of September and it is close to making a new high.\n\nThe MACD oscillator on this longer time frame is narrowing towards a new upside crossover and outright go long signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of AMD, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $37.11 being projected. This would be a new high for the move up and a breakout from the sideways range. Higher targets will probably be projected if AMD reaches $35.66.\n\nBottom line strategy: I have no insights about AMD's upcoming earnings but traders and investors seem to be pretty confident that the numbers could be bullish. Buyers ahead of the numbers need to risk below $31.", "description": "Let's check and see if this uptrend can be sustained....AMD", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Advanced Micro Devices Looks Set For An Upside Breakout", "Let'S Check", "See If This Uptrend Can Be Sustained.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Jim Cramer", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/05614e42-bdb6-11e7-9ebe-a9f6f1518a13.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
