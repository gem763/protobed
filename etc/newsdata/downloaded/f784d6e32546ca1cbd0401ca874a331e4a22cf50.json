They will not be able to fly to other destinations such as Santiago de Cuba, Camag\u00fcey, and Varadero, among others. The affected airlines, including American, Delta and JetBlue, will have 45 days to wrap up their operations to those destinations, the official added.\n\nThe measure will be effective on December 10, 2019.\n\nThe nine destinations impacted are: Ignacio Agramonte International Airport in Camag\u00fcey; the Jardines del Rey Airport in Cayo Coco; the Vilo Acu\u00f1a Airport in Cayo Largo; the Jaime Gonz\u00e1lez Airport in Cienfuegos; the Frank Pa\u00eds Airport in Holgu\u00edn; the Sierra Maestra Airport in Manzanillo; the Juan Gualberto G\u00f3mez Airport in Matanzas; the Abel Santamar\u00eda Airport in Santa Clara; and the Antonio Maceo Airport in Santiago de Cuba.\n\nExplore where you live.

We will continue to comply with federal law, work with the administration, and update our policies and procedures regarding travel to Cuba as necessary.\u201d\n\nJetBlue said the company will also comply with the new regulations. \u201cWe are beginning to work with our various government and commercial partners to understand the full impact of this change on our customers and operations in Camag\u00fcey, Holgu\u00edn and Santa Clara,\u201d the company said in a statement sent to the Miami Herald.\n\nDelta did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nCharter flights, on which many Cuban-Americans travel to Cuba from Miami, will not be affected. Scheduled commercial flights to Cuba began under the administration of Barack Obama in 2016. They improved the conditions of the service and the prices of the flights, which until then had been the monopoly of less-efficient charter companies.\n\n\u201cWe have seen how the Cuban government has benefited from American travelers. We will not allow these funds to be siphoned to the government coffers,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe suspension of flights is the most recent in a set of measures that the Trump administration has taken to deprive the Cuban government of revenue and punish it for its support of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo requested the suspension to the Department of Transportation in a letter sent this Friday.\n\n\u201cSuspending flights to these nine airports sends a clear message to the Cuban government that the United States is taking firm action in response to the regime\u00b4s ongoing repression of its people and support to Maduro,\u201d Pompeo wrote.\n\nThe U.S. does not recognize Maduro as the legitimate president of Venezuela. It has accused the island\u2019s government of preventing a political transition in Venezuela by offering security and intelligence services to Maduro.\n\nOn Monday, new restrictions on the Cuban government imposed by the Department of Commerce entered into force. The agency revoked the authorizations for U.S. companies to lease planes to Cuban government airlines. As a result, Cubana de Aviacion, the leading Cuban airline, canceled flights to seven international destinations because several leasing companies canceled their contracts.\n\nIn June, the U.S. banned cruise trips to Cuba, as well as trips by private planes and yachts. In October, the administration announced new limits on remittances to the island.\n\nThe Trump administration also sanctioned companies that facilitate shipments of Venezuelan oil to the island, which had been part of an agreement conceived by Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro and that Maduro continues to honor despite the dramatic decline in Venezuelan oil production. The sanctions caused fuel shortages in September in Cuba, and the government was forced to impose austerity measures.\n\nPresident Trump also authorized lawsuits against companies that benefit from property confiscated after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. American Airlines faces one of these lawsuits, in this case, for its use of the Havana airport.\n\nAbout 50 airlines, including five American companies, fly to Havana and use the Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport.\n\nThe sanctions were announced on the same day that an event organized by several organizations of Cuban exiles and opponents will be held in Miami. The secretary of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, is scheduled to deliver a speech.\n\nFollow Nora G\u00e1mez Torres on Twitter: @ngameztorres", "description": "The United States will suspend scheduled flights to nine destinations in Cuba.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/d079c1/picture213953864/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Jetbluesanta.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
