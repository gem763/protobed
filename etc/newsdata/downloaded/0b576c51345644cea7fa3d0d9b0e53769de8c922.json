Last time they performed in the US, in 2008, there was chaos with all the arguing. It has put Geri off \u2014 as well as Melanie C and Emma [Bunton] to some degree.'\n\nReports: The Spice Girls' reported plans to tour Australia and take on a Las Vegas residency are said to have been scrapped, because of Geri Horner's (L) alleged feud with Mel B (R)\n\nThe publication reports that Geri was 'annoyed' when Mel B announced their plans to tour Australia during their final show at London's Wembley Arena earlier this year, because she'd 'made it clear she wasn't into' continuing' the road show.\n\nExplained the source: 'Geri was adamant that doing big commitments abroad would only be worth it if they were financially lucrative. But the payday for a residency would be much lower than their UK shows and would mean the girls being away from their families and other jobs for a prolonged period.\n\n'Family life is really important to them all and they were concerned about how they would be able to make any of it work.'\n\nReunited and it feels so good: The stars reunited with their bandmates (L-R) Emma Bunton and Melanie C for a 13-date tour of the UK earlier this year\n\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for the Spice Girls for comment.\n\nThe report comes one month after Yorkshire-born star Mel B joked that Geri 'still hates [her],' months after her claims that they had a lesbian fling.\n\nMel made the comment during an appearance on ITV's Loose Women on September 5th, but went on to admit she is still close with the star.\n\nIn March, Mel made the explosive claim that she had sex with Geri during the height of the Spice Girls' fame in 1990s, and the star recently revealed that the revelation made things 'awkward' between them.\n\n\n\nClash: According to The Sun, the singers continually clashed during one of their previous tours. Pictured together in February 2013\n\nMel told the Loose Women panel: 'God, it was strange. For me, the whole thing was .... I think she probably hated me for a bit, she probably still does. But we all love each other. I've got a loud mouth so what can you do.'\n\nThe openly bisexual singer made the shock claim while filming for Piers Morgan's Life Stories in March, cheekily telling the broadcaster Geri had 'great boobs' and adding: 'It just happened and we just giggled at it and that was it.'\n\nMel reunited with her band mates Geri, Melanie Chisholm and Emma for a 13-day UK reunion tour this summer and admitted that rehearsals were initially 'awkward' between her and Geri following her interview on Piers Morgan's Life Stories in May.\n\nExplosive: In March Mel claimed that she had sex with Geri during the height of their fame (above in 1997), putting their friendship under strain\n\nShe recently told Mail On Sunday's Event magazine of her interaction with Geri after the explosive interview: 'I texted her on the night I did the Piers Morgan show and explained what he\u2019d said and how I\u2019d answered and she was fine with it.\n\n'The problem was it then got hyped up into a much bigger story, and it didn\u2019t help that we were just about to begin rehearsals. It was awkward.\n\n'We hadn\u2019t been back in the situation of being together every single day, being on stage, rehearsing, getting ourselves back into Spice Girls mode, and then all the headlines about our relationship were thrown into the mix, which was pretty bad timing.'\n\nWhile much was made of the Spice Girls reuniting, it was noted that Victoria 'Posh Spice' Beckham, 45, refused to join her erstwhile bandmates for the tour.\n\nNo return: The reunion didn't include Victoria 'Posh Spice' Beckham (centre), who refused to take part in the tour.
