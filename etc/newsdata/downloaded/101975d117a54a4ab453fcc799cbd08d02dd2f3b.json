At that time, I had barely moved to the U.S.,\u201d Schulte told MMA Junkie. \u201cI make no excuses for that loss. After that, I evolved significantly as a fighter. I keep adjusting and improving things. After things stabilized, I went on to become the first PFL champion. This year, after surgery, I had two good wins in this season and guaranteed my playoff spot. Now I\u2019m putting in the work to become the champion again this year.\u201d\n\nTo achieve that goal, Schulte will have to win twice Thursday night, starting with a quarterfinal win over Nijem (10-7 MMA, 1-1 PFL), who he had already scouted ahead of their scheduled meeting in July, which fell through after Nijem missed weight.\n\n\u201cI was getting ready specifically to fight him, but since he didn\u2019t make weight, I ended up fighting Jesse Ronson,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was hard to change everything at the last minute (as) Jesse is a totally different fighter. But since Ramsey had already earned three points from the fact that the Ronys Torres couldn\u2019t fight in May (due to failed medicals), he remained in the tournament. That\u2019s how we ended up getting matched up again. I hope he makes weight this time, since I had already trained for him.\u201d\n\nIn a quirk of PFL\u2019s scoring system, Nijem made it to the playoffs despite never actually stepping into the cage during the regular season. Some might view that position as an advantageous one since he arrives fresh at the tournament\u2019s sharp end. But Schulte doesn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cAlthough Ramsey didn\u2019t take any damage by not fighting, he\u2019s also out of his fighting rhythm,\u201d he suggested. \u201cStaying active makes the biggest difference. I feel that\u2019s going to help me. I know that he\u2019s a good fighter, a wrestler who trains at altitude. We\u2019re getting ready with that in mind.\u201d\n\nIf he gets past Nijem, Schulte will face the winner of the all-Russian quarterfinal clash between Akhmet Aliev and Rashid Magomedov, with the semifinal matchup taking place later that night. Schulte says he\u2019s not concerned about who wins, but hopes the matchup is a long, punishing war for both men to send the winner through to the final four in less than prime condition.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both very tough and excellent strikers,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they have a very difficult fight against each other. I feel they have the same style. They\u2019re versatile strikers with heavy hands. I\u2019ll be ready for whoever wins.\u201d", "description": "PFL's 2018 lightweight champion, Natan Schulte, looks ahead to his 2019 playoff campaign as he bids to claim back-to-back titles.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Christian Stein", "Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/natan-schulte-rashid-magomedov-pfl-11-10.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
