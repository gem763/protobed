They have trailed by a combined 55-14 score in the first half of the last two games.\n\n\u201cI hate the scoreboard doesn\u2019t show it,\u201d Collins said Tuesday. \u201cI hate that the results don\u2019t show it in the win-loss columns, but you never can discount the effort that these guys are putting forward. We\u2019ve gotten better in every single phase. We\u2019ve just got to understand in critical moments we can\u2019t have setbacks, and the story of the game was the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThings happened to us in a negative way. We couldn\u2019t overcome \u2018em, and the score got out of hand really quickly.\u201d\n\nOut of 130 FBS teams, Georgia Tech\u2019s offense ranks second-worst nationally in the red zone, seventh-worst in scoring, 114th in third-down percentage, 108th in sacks allowed and 93rd in giveaways. The Jackets, with a freshman quarterback in James Graham and a thin offensive line hit with injuries, have scored seven points in the first quarter this season.\n\nAgainst Duke, the defense allowed scores on all five of his first-half drives, due in part to three fourth-down conversions. Georgia Tech hasn\u2019t forced a fumble since the second game against South Florida and ranks 102nd in sacks and 98th in turnover margin.\n\nThe offense figures to rotate in more players on the line this week. With Kenny Cooper and Jahaziel Lee lost to season-ending injuries, center William Lay, right guard Conner Hansen, right tackle Jared Southers, left guard Jack DeFoor and left tackle Zach Quinney will likely start for the third straight game. But Collins indicated that Mikey Minihan, a starter the first two games before getting an injured leg, will get plenty of snaps against Miami. Scott Morgan, sidelined by injuries in spring and preseason, is healthy and figures to have to have some chances, too.\n\nGraham, a redshirt freshman with 50 incompletions in 91 attempts, will make his third straight start.\n\n\u201cIn this league he faces so many things week to week from a front standpoint, coverages, where to go with the ball,\u201d offensive coordinator Dave Patenaude said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to expand our pass game, so when those forces meet each other there\u2019s a lot of things he\u2019s never seen before and he\u2019s kind of reacting on his own.\u201d\n\nCollins likes what he sees, though. Graham\u2019s development mirrors how the coach takes a big-picture look at his program. He trusts the same approach his staff used to go 15-10 at Temple the last two years before he replaced Paul Johnson at Georgia Tech.\n\n\u201cI know one thing, our processes work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve won a ton of games doing it this way and we\u2019re going to continue to teach our guys how to do it. Not doing it this is guaranteed not to work and conversely being positive or being negative, us being negative is guaranteed not to work. Us being positive and building these guys up as we develop this program is guaranteed to work.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Coach Geoff Collins keeps trying to find something positive in a difficult first season at Georgia Tech.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/georgia_tech_duke_football_05247_c0-1178-2568-2676_s1200x700.jpg?ceab840fffe55f3609fbea75420ddea715a9ea97", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
