I would have eaten that stuff day and night \u2014 even if there weren\u2019t toys occasionally waiting inside. Those days I got my Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs and a chance at a delightful new toy? Those were the best.\n\nSadly, Google\u2019s marketing team didn\u2019t quite capture that nostalgia in a new Pixel 4 giveaway \u2014 because the picture you see above (and its associated video) is a terrible, terrible lie.\n\nYes, the irony of Calvin and Hobbes was totally lost on me as a child\n\nCan you imagine the anticipation of cracking open a box of cereal wondering if a free $800+ smartphone is inside? That an explosion of alkali-processed cocoa and disintegrated corn might be accompanied by a flagship Google handset tumbling into your bowl?\n\nBut no. The reality is that 2,000 people who already pre-ordered the phone in the UK, already put their money down, are simply getting a fancy compartmentalized box with a bonus bag of cereal. It\u2019s a nice gesture, but it feels pretty random. What does the Pixel have to do with breakfast? And Google\u2019s going to offer something \u201cFREE INSIDE\u201d as its sticker shows, it might have wanted to pick something different than Google Photos uploads?\n\nDid not expect the Pixel 4 to come in a cereal box! pic.twitter.com/aVyhvfiq5U \u2014 Guto Aaron (@MrGutoA) October 22, 2019\n\nBut imagine if Google had done it right and made it a total surprise. Your phone is IP68-rated, Google! It should be able to handle crushed corn dust and a splash of milk just fine. Yes, perhaps it\u2019d be way too heavy for a box of cereal and give its presence away \u2014 but I\u2019d definitely have mailed in quite a few box-tops for a chance at a phone with built-in radar. Sure would have beaten a propeller beanie, if you know what I mean.", "description": "Google is giving 2,000 lucky Pixel 4 customers in the UK... a fancy cereal box with their phone inside. It\u2019s not exactly the nostalgia trigger you\u2019d think, but what if Google did something more like what we remember from our childhood?", "authors": ["Sean Hollister", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRi0qzJKx4dtXUtLDaJ2OmzrZrs=/0x127:1590x959/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19311312/pixel_cereal_box_stunt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
