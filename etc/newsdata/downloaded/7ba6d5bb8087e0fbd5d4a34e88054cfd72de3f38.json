Friends of mine who have asked earnest questions about vaccine safety on social media have been dismissed or teased. That\u2019s not a great way to educate someone who is confused or scared, and it\u2019s certainly not a kind way to treat a friend.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a conspiracy theorist to question why you\u2019re putting aluminum into your child\u2019s body or wonder if it\u2019s dangerous to give multiple shots at once. Science is all about asking questions. No one should be shamed for trying to understand how medicine works.\n\nThe issue, of course, is that there is so much misinformation out there that it can be hard to separate facts from myths. Not to mention that certain truths without context can sound simply terrifying. Take the fact that some vaccines contain formaldehyde. Why in the world would anyone willingly put something found in a mortuary into their child? I don\u2019t blame anyone for having a negative gut reaction to that information.\n\nWhen you have the full story, however, it sounds less scary. Formaldehyde is used to kill viruses or deactivate bacterial toxins in some vaccines. It\u2019s basically the thing that keeps those germs from making you sick, while still providing immunity. Most of the formaldehyde is removed before the vaccine is given, but very small amounts make it into the final dose. It\u2019s actually less than the amount found in a pear. Plus, we all produce small amounts of formaldehyde in our bodies.\n\nAfter seeing friends worry about vaccines, and struggle to find information, I decided to make a short video about them. What started as one video turned into three as I dug deeper into their history. Vaccines are over 200 years old, so there were two centuries of scientific discoveries and controversies to uncover. I tried to answer the most pressing questions that people have about these shots, and I learned a lot in the process. I hope you do, too.", "description": "It's responsible to ask questions about your health.
