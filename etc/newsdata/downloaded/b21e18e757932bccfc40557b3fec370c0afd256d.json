Reuters reported last week that The We Company was considering seeking a valuation in its IPO of between $10 billion and $12 billion, a steep discount from the $47 billion valuation it achieved in January.\n\nGlen Kacher, chief investment officer of $2 billion Light Street Capital Management LLC, said no one should be surprised by rapidly changing valuations for private companies such as WeWork, given how common large price swings are in public markets.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the market,\u201d Kacher said, speaking alongside Kupor at the annual New York City event. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nKacher contrasted WeWork with Uber Technologies Inc, one of Light Street\u2019s investments.\n\nHe said Uber\u2019s \"SaaS,\" or software as a service, creates significant value because its cars and drivers can be used by many customers every day, whereas a set of WeWork's rented desks can only be used by one client at a time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where technology is marrying up with these fixed assets to create services ... that's a very unique economic solution (for Uber),\u201d he said. \u201cAs opposed to WeWork, which is just carving a floor up into very tiny little spaces. That\u2019s their technology.\u201d\n\nKacher said he continues to find SoftBank Group an \u201cinteresting\u201d investment opportunity, in part because Uber represents a bigger part of its portfolio than WeWork.\n\nEarlier, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission head Jay Clayton, in an on-stage interview at the conference, would not comment on WeWork's IPO directly.\n\nHe did say, however, that it \"doesn't surprise\" him that there would be differing valuations in public and private markets for the same type of company.\n\n\"The price discovery mechanism is completely different,\" Clayton said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Delevingne; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Tom Brown)", "description": "Scott Kupor, managing partner of $10 billion venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference that it would be \u201cdangerous\u201d to generalize from the WeWork situation as it stems from the confluence of multiple factors.
