Reuters\n\nMalaysia\u2019s prime minister-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim is expecting the handover of power to happen around May 2020, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nAccording to the report, the 72-year-old said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Wednesday (Sept 18) that there was \u201can understanding that it should be around that time, but I don\u2019t think I should be too petty about the exact month\u201d.\n\nIt is widely understood that there is an arrangement for the former deputy prime minister to take over as prime minister when Mahathir Mohamad steps down, although the 93-year-old has not stated when he will do so.\n\nBloomberg also quoted Anwar as saying that there was \u201cno sign of any party introducing or promoting or lobbying for other names\u201d. He added that there could be other individuals \u201cwith ambitions with their own design\u201d, but said he considered these \u201cquite irrelevant\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhether it has been discussed, whether it has been given legitimacy, the answer is no,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\nIn January, the president of the People\u2019s Justice Party (PKR), called out the Financial Times for what he said was \u201cfake news\u201d. The Times had reported then that Anwar said there were \u201cpockets, people who for their own reasons would like to sabotage these arrangements\u201d.\n\nRumours of factions within the Pakatan Harapan coalition were fuelled again later when the country\u2019s economics minister became implicated in a sex tape leak in June. Despite the accusation, official investigators could not successfully identify the men in the videos.\n\nAnwar\u2019s aide, Farhash Wafa Salvador Rizal Mubarak, was one of those arrested to assist with investigations into the leak.\n\nAnwar also spoke to Bloomberg on the haze issue, calling it an \u201cecological warfare\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, eight areas across Malaysia recorded \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d air quality readings, while 35 places were marked \u201cunhealthy\u201d. A total of 214 schools were ordered shut as a result.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - He added that there could be other individuals \"with ambitions with their own design\", but said he considered these \"quite irrelevant\"..
