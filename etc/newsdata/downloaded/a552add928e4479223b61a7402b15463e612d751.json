For a glimpse of sentiment on the mainland, they can turn to other other emerging markets instead.\n\nIt\u2019s all about correlation. China tends to drive assets in the developing world, especially now that the trade battle has magnified swings in sentiment. Beijing\u2019s decision earlier this year to let the yuan slip to the lowest in at least a decade triggered a slump in MSCI\u2019s benchmark currency and equity gauges. The 50-day correlation between MSCI\u2019s currencies index and the is above 60%, historically considered high.\n\n\u201cAlthough China is away, the crucial issue of the trade war hasn\u2019t vanished and remains on the minds of investors,\u201d said Piotr Matys, a London-based emerging-markets strategist at Rabobank. \u201cIf we have some remarks from U.S. officials that would suggest progress is unlikely, then investors are going to use the most liquid EM currencies.\u201d\n\nNearby currencies with the highest contagion -- such as the Taiwanese dollar and Malaysian ringgit -- are the most correlated with China\u2019s currency, based on weekly moves during the past 10 years. Yet the South African rand, which is often used as a proxy for broader sentiment, may be another gauge to monitor, according to Matys. Should the yuan weaken, \u201cthen other EM currencies will follow,\u201d he said.\n\nRead More: Use the Force on China? There\u2019s Just One Problem: John Authers\n\nEven with China shut, there\u2019s nothing stopping officials there or in the U.S. from offering up new trade rhetoric. Developing-nation currencies fell this week even after President Donald Trump\u2019s administration played down a Bloomberg report on Friday that the White House was weighing limits on U.S. portfolio flows into China.\n\nChina reopens on Tuesday, and trade developments will almost certainly dominate the headlines, given than China\u2019s chief negotiator Liu He is set to visit the U.S. that same week for further talks.\n\nExchange-traded funds traded in the U.S. can also show investor sentiment while Chinese markets are closed. The iShares MSCI China ETF -- known by its ticker MCHI -- fell as much as 1% Tuesday, the 10th decline in 12 days. Chinese equities seem to drive emerging-market ETFs more broadly, too; the performance of MSCI\u2019s developing-nation gauge is almost identical to one that excludes China.\n\nMoney managers could look to Hong Kong or position with Chinese American depositary receipts, said Michael Hirson, New York-based practice head for China and northeast Asia at Eurasia Group. Hong Kong\u2019s H-share index, which tracks mostly state companies listed in the former British colony, could provide some insights. Markets in nations closest to China\u2019s economic cycle, such as Australia and Brazil could also be good proxies, Hirson said.\n\nEmerging-market hard currency debt may be worth watching with China away, according to Damian Sassower, chief emerging-markets credit strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. He expects the Asian nation to maintain its outsized impact on emerging markets, with trade especially important.\n\nSovereign and corporate issuer revenues are often linked to global growth, which is essentially global trade with China, he said. The spreads of a Bloomberg Barclays (LON: ) index tracking developing-nation hard currency bonds tends to follow China\u2019s five-year CDS, a proxy for the sovereign credit risk, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more correlated when you\u2019re talking about the impact of China on EM hard currency debt simply because of the way it trades,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more liquid.\u201d", "description": "Here\u2019s How to Track Trade Sentiment While China\u2019s Closed for Golden Week", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic94f15d2132310da6770038fd1f971664.jpg"}
