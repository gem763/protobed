being treated as commodities (Picture: World Animal Protection/Getty)\n\nMillions of wild animals are being kept as exotic pets or killed and turned into fashion accessories, according to a shock new report.\n\nSeals, crocodiles, elephants and pythons are among those being killed or traded alive as demand soars from consumers in the west.\n\nIn just four years, over 2.7 million vulnerable animals from Africa were legally farmed or captured and then traded.\n\nMany would have suffered immensely with some even being boiled or skinned alive.\n\nExperts say the industry is now pushing many wild animals to the brink of extinction.\n\nGlobal Wildlife Advisor at World Animal Protection, Dr Neil D\u2019Cruze, said: \u2018Trading animals in this way may be legal but it doesn\u2019t make it right.\n\n\u2018These are wild-animals, not factory-produced goods.\u2019\n\nMore than 1,000 rhinos were killed last year for their horns (Picture: World Animal Protection)\n\nThe African grey parrot

the charity describes how vulnerable species are being turned into commodities and traded to the point of extinction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt highlighted the plight of Nile crocodiles who are farmed and slaughtered for their leather.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2015 \u2013 the latest figures available \u2013 over 189,000 skins were exported.\n\nIn Namibia there is a booming trade in the fur from cape seals.\n\nEach year thousands of the pups are rounded up and clubbed or suffocated to death.\n\nThe group said that adults were shot or clubbed and sometimes skinned alive for their fur to be used in fashion accessories, such as handbags and gloves.\n\nAn African Elephant roaming free (Picture: Getty)\n\nElephant skins are used in car interiors (Picture: Getty)\n\nElephants are

used for jackets and car interiors.\n\nBecause of their size, bullets often miss their mark resulting in a prolonged and agonising death.\n\nZebras are also hunted for their unique black and white skins to be used as decoration in homes and businesses.\n\nFive species most in demand to be exotic pets Ball python African grey parrot Emporer scorpion Leopard tortoise Savannah monitor

said there is also a booming trade in the export of live animals to be kept as pets.\n\nThe most popular pets are ball pythons and over half a million have recently been shipped live from Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe US is the biggest destination where they are destined for life inside a glass display tank.\n\nAfrican grey parrots were also exported across the globe and are said to suffer considerably during capture and transport.\n\nA total of 289,006 birds that should be flying free are now caged.\n\nFur from the seals are turned into trinkets (Picture: World

\u2018This cruel industry hurts wild animals and can damage Africa\u2019s biodiversity with devastating long-term impact on livelihoods and economies too.\n\n\u2018How did we get to the point where animals are exported and greedily exploited for our personal pleasure?\n\n\u2018Does the life of an animal mean nothing at all?\u2019\n\nA crocodile skin handbag (Picture: World Animal
