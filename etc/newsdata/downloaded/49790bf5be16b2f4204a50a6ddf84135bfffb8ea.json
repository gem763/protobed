Brown, who lived across from Jean, testified in the case, providing key details about events immediately before and after the September 2018 murder.\n\nNow Brown's own shooting death, on Friday, is under investigation. His attorney said he was getting out of his car in the parking lot near his apartment when he was shot multiple times at close range. He was found lying on the ground and was brought to a local hospital, where he died.\n\nREAD: Ex-Dallas cop Amber Guyger was sentenced to 10 years for killing unarmed black man\n\nWitnesses who flagged down cops said they\u2019d seen a silver sedan speed away, but there are no detailed descriptions of the suspects. The police department said in its statement that there are no suspects or known motives.\n\nIt was Brown\u2019s testimony that undermined a key element of Guyger\u2019s defense \u2014 that she shouted commands before firing at Jean. Brown testified that he could hear Jean singing in his apartment and did not hear Guyger shout any commands before he heard gunshots.\n\n\u201cBrown lived in constant fear that he could be the next victim of gun violence, either state sanctioned or otherwise,\u201d Lee Merritt, a lawyer working with Brown\u2019s relatives, wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday.\n\nREAD: 'Not racist, but ...': Ex-Dallas cop Amber Guyger sent sketchy texts months before murdering unarmed black man\n\nAnd Brown\u2019s work as a witness wasn\u2019t done. He was set to testify in a civil case brought by Jean\u2019s family against the city of Dallas in connection with the killing.\n\n\u201cTo have a key witness suddenly be killed is suspicious. Was this related to the trial? There is no clear indication,\u201d Merritt told CBS News.\n\nCover: In this Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2019, photo, victim Botham Jean's neighbor Joshua Brown, left, answers questions from Assistant District Attorney LaQuita Long, right, while pointing to a map of the South Side Flats where he lives, while testifying during the murder trial of former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger, in Dallas.
