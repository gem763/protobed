It is only through online sales that fruit farmers can boost their sales and gain larger profit margins,\" said Qi Difeng, a farmer and fruit grower in Cixi.\n\nIn June, when red bayberries are ripe and taste the sweetest, more than 400,000 orders were made, with a combined sales volume of over 100 million yuan, statistics from the agro-product e-commerce association in Cixi show.\n\nZhejiang province, which is home to e-commerce giant Alibaba, has 1,573 Taobao villages, ranking first in the nation.", "description": "For Yu Jiwan, Party secretary of the Cangtian village in Cixi, Zhejiang province, the booming Taobao businesses in the village have introduced positive changes, providing a seamless connection between the production, marketing and sales of the sanitary ware produced in the village.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/22/5dae66d1a310cf3e97a25e65.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
