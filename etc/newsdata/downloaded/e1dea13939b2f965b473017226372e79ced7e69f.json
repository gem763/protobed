(Tony Avelar/AP)\n\nNearly 51 years after the organization expelled Tommie Smith and John Carlos from the Summer Olympics, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee is bestowing its highest honor on two of the sporting world\u2019s most iconic activists.\n\nThe sprinters highlight the USOPC Hall of Fame\u2019s latest induction class and will be formally honored at a ceremony Nov. 1 in Colorado Springs, the organization announced Monday. This year\u2019s inductees also include basketball player Lisa Leslie, gymnast Nastia Liukin, beach volleyball player Misty May-Treanor, speedskater Apolo Anton Ohno, swimmer Dara Torres and the 1998 U.S. Olympic women\u2019s ice hockey team.\n\nThe organization\u2019s hall of fame was established in 1979. It has been dormant for stretches; this year marks the first induction class since 2012 and the 16th overall.\n\nSmith and Carlos were responsible for one of the most recognizable moments in Olympic history, raising their fists in protest on the medals podium at the 1968 Summer Olympics. They have both previously been bestowed with a long list of honors, including induction into the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame.\n\nTheir exclusion from the USOPC\u2019s hall highlighted the thorny relationship the organization has had with the two sprinters for decades. At the 1968 Games in Mexico City, the USOPC \u2014 which was known as the U.S. Olympic Committee until changing its name earlier this year \u2014 succumbed to pressure and sent the men home following their controversial protest.\n\n\u201cOne could be forgiven for rolling their eyes at the USOC finally \u2014 after 51 years \u2014 catching up with the rest of the world,\u201d Dave Zirin, the sports columnist for the Nation who co-wrote Carlos\u2019s autobiography, wrote in an email Monday.\n\n[From 2018: Two sprinters gave the black-power salute at the Olympics. It took them decades to recover from that gesture.]\n\nU.S. Olympic officials were aware well ahead of time that a group of athletes had been considering a boycott of the 1968 Summer Games altogether. Among other things, the protesting athletes wanted more black coaches; South Africa and Rhodesia to be excluded from the Olympics; and the removal of Avery Brundage, the controversial president of the International Olympic Committee who was accused of racism and anti-Semitism, from power.\n\nDoug Roby, head of the USOC at the time, wrote Brundage a letter two months before the Mexico City Games commenced, saying, \u201cWe intend to have every athlete thoroughly understand that we will countenance no nonsense and that anyone that participates or that attempts to participate in any demonstration as referred to, will be immediately suspended as a member of our team and returned to his home at the earliest possible date.\u201d\n\nIn Mexico, Smith broke the world record in the 200-meter race and Carlos finished in third. On the medals podium, each man raised a fist and bowed his head. They wore black gloves and no shoes, drawing attention to oppression, poverty and pride.\n\n\n\nU.S. athletes Tommie Smith, center, and John Carlos at the Mexico City Games. (AP) (Stf/AP)\n\nThat sparked a swirl of activity from Olympic officials. The USOPC initially decided against a suspension, intending to issue a warning to the rest of the American athletes competing in Mexico. The International Olympic Committee demanded a stronger response, though, fearing \u201cthat racial dissension might spread to other delegations if USOC refused to suspend Smith and Carlos,\u201d according to a dispatch sent from the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City at the time.\n\nThe IOC met twice the next day. According to that organization\u2019s minutes, the group felt \u201csomething had to be done as this incident could not be ignored.\u201d The IOC\u2019s feelings were shared with the USOPC, which held its own executive committee meeting.\n\n\u201cPresident Roby reconvened his Board and in plain English relayed the edict-vote to send Smith and Carlos packing or the USA would be eliminated,\u201d Robert Paul Jr., the USOPC\u2019s communications director at the time, later wrote.\n\n[Blackistone: Activist Suzan Shown Harjo is still winning her fight against Native American mascots]\n\nThe USOPC sent out a statement to reporters expressing its \u201cprofound regrets to the International Olympic Committee, to the Mexican Organizing Committee and to the people of Mexico for the discourtesy displayed by two members of its team.\u201d At a news conference, Roby \u201cemphasized USOC action taken under pressure from IOC,\u201d Paul wrote.\n\nRoby died in 1992. If he had regrets, he kept those to himself. In letters that are now stored in the University of Michigan archives, he defended the decision and said feedback he received ran as much as 10 to 1 in support of the USOPC\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cThe Olympic Games is not a place for demonstrations of any type,\u201d he wrote in response to one letter-writer. \u201cIf we had let the incident regarding Tommie Smith and John Carlos pass without some sort of action being taken, we might have had some demonstrations of the Czechs against the Soviets, Israel against the Arab countries, South Korea against North Korea, or Cuba against the United States, to mention but a few, and our ceremonies would have been a farce.\u201d\n\nSmith and Carlos felt ostracized from the Olympic community for many years but have increasingly been heralded as both iconic activists and accomplished athletes. In 2016, the two were invited to visit the White House and President Barack Obama, along with that year\u2019s U.S. Summer Olympics team.\n\n\u201cCarlos and Smith have been proven correct by history,\u201d Zirin wrote. \u201cThey were correct that South Africa and Rhodesia should not be allowed into the Olympics. They were correct that Avery Brundage was a racist who had no business heading the IOC. They were correct that the injustices of 1968 demanded a visceral and visual response. This is a case of the USOC finally acknowledging the nose on its face.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nAmerican fencer kneels on medal stand during anthem\n\nThis group is supposed to handle Olympic sex abuse complaints.
