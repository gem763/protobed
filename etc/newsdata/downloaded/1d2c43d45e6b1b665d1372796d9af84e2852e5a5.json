It was brought to Twitter\u2019s attention by Kate Ahmad, a neurologist in Sydney who tweeted \u201cIf you don\u2019t think women in medicine have problems \u2013 check out the required textbook for orthopaedics at one Australian med school\u201d along with pictures from the book.\u201d\n\nOne woman is having her fingers, then elbow, examined though her recovery after the supposed brachial plexus (the group of nerves that supply the arm and hand) trauma is clearly not the only thing on her mind, going by her see-through bra and seductive expression. The opaque lingerie item makes an appearance on another woman in the book too, this time paired with red hotpants, in a state of near nakedness that must be essential \u2013 for medical reasons, obviously \u2013 to her heel examination. The same woman appears on the back cover, with a male doctor\u2019s hands on her hips.\n\nThese were from a 2003 edition, but Ahmad has pointed out that even the newer 2014 edition, by now published by Cambridge University Press, still has images that objectify women. One is of a woman in a push-up bra, being examined (\u201ctesting pectoralis major\u201d) by a male doctor.\n\nAhmad, a neurologist who is gathering material for a talk on women in medicine at the hospital where she works and is vice-president of its women\u2019s society, was sent these pictures. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d she says. \u201cThey objectify women. It\u2019s a completely inappropriate relationship going on between the examiner and the patient \u2013 you would be concerned if you saw your colleagues examining a patient like this.\u201d What does it say about the medical field\u2019s attitude to women? \u201cIt highlights all the things that plague women in medicine. One is that women are still not considered to be equal to men; there\u2019s still a bit of a boys\u2019 club mentality and that makes it difficult for women to advance their careers. Second, men are still objectifying women \u2013 women are judged on what they look like and that can be as a patient or a colleague.\u201d\n\nThe feminist campaigner and writer, Caroline Criado Perez, says the images \u201clook like soft porn\u201d. In a statement, Cambridge University Press said it was working on a third edition of the book, which it said was \u201cwidely used\u201d, and that images will be reviewed \u201cto ensure they are appropriate and relevant\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is an implied sexualisation there, plus all the doctors in these pictures are male so there is a representation of the medical world of things getting done by men to women, who are standing there looking sexy,\u201d says Criado Perez, author of Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men. \u201cWhich is ironic because the vast majority of medical data has been collected on men \u2013 women get worse medical care because we know less about their bodies.\u201d", "description": "In a classic book on orthopaedics, photographs show male doctors examining smiling female patients in see-through underwear \u2026", "authors": ["Emine Saner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1067abf95421956a60992726ff3e009e6883897/0_568_794_476/master/794.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9a8a29dfda106b620ac75293be8586bd", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
