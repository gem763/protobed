Research last year found that retail therapy - far from being empty and superficial - can be an \u2018effective way to minimise sadness.\u2019 It can even help a person feel more in control of their environment, researchers claim. Generations of consumers have been urged to satisfy their desire to keep abreast of the latest fashion by simply browsing in store and window shopping. But researchers from the University of Michigan claim \u2018retail therapy\u2019 should no longer be dismissed as it could help people overcome melancholy. The study carried out three experiments to investigate whether shopping restored a sense of control in people to combat feelings of sadness. The research found that buying something was up to 40 times more effective at giving people a sense of control and they were three times happier than those who only browsed. Previous studies have shown that shoppers enjoy positive feelings when reflecting on their most recent purchase, when that shopping had been motivated by a desire to repair mood.\n\nThe researchers found that increasing the period during which a time-limited offer was available from four to 12 seconds increased the chance of it being chosen by 13 per cent.\n\nThey also discovered that people didn't choose time-limited offers to avoid the regret of missing out on the best offer, as was previously thought.\n\n\u2018The main mechanism by which time-limited offers benefit retailers is not by using time constraints to impair the rationality of consumers\u2019 decision making,\u2019 the researchers\u2019 paper reads.\n\n\u2018Rather it is a mechanism of search deterrence \u2013 a restriction of consumers\u2019 opportunities to compare available offers \u2013 amplified by consumers\u2019 risk aversion.'\n\nThe research paper says a time-limited offer \u2018presents a consumer with a binary decision under uncertainty\u2019.\n\nAnd the more they think about the decision, the stronger the feeling of wanting to avoid a risk becomes.\n\n'The search-deterring effects of time-limited offers are intensified by psychological factors, particularly when consumers are not subject to high time pressure,' said Dr Mengjie Wang from the University of East Anglia.\n\nEven when subjects were allowed only four seconds in which to accept or reject an offer, their decisions were rational and \u2018remarkably sophisticated\u2019.\n\nThe research challenges previously assumptions that consumers are prone to making less rational decisions under time pressure.\n\nThe study - which was conducted by researchers at the University of Anglia and the University of Queensland, Australia - was published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization.", "description": "Researchers from the University of East Anglia found people were less motivated by panic than they had expected them to be, and made surprisingly rational, calculated decisions under pressure.", "authors": ["Mailonline Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/17/20143292-0-image-a-31_1571935620024.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
