He had a few good quips throughout, such as when he announced, \u201cThis town hall will discuss the issues affecting our community: LGBTQ and straight girls who make pride about them.\u201d But for the most part, he was there to keep the sketch moving.\n\nAD\n\nThe guest stars\n\nHe quickly brought out the short sketch\u2019s first major highlight: Celebrity guest Billy Porter, the fashionista and recently Emmy-winning actor from \u201cPose,\u201d who was there to announce the candidates and give the show an early injection of high-voltage energy. Each candidate came with a jubilantly shouted intro.\n\nAD\n\nFor Cory Booker: \u201cHe may live in the projects, but ladies, he ain\u2019t no project!\u201d For Pete Buttigeg: \u201cRepresenting house of booty-gig, it\u2019s Mayor Pete!\u201d For Elizabeth Warren: \u201cWarren-ing! Warren-ing! \u2026 She\u2019s got a plan for the future!\u201d For Juli\u00e1n Castro: \u201cFrom the house, of urban deliciousness!\u201d For Joe Biden: \u201cThe Delaware daddy whose only vice is the choo-choo train!\u201d\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda appearing as Castro was the second major surprise of the sketch. He burst onto the stage assuming he\u2019s on \u201cQueer Eye.\u201d When asked if he is elected president, how he will bring more queer voices into his cabinet, he responded, \u201cFirst of all, gracias. As a Democrat, I want to apologize for not being gay. But I promise to do better in the future. However, I am Latino, which we can all agree is something. Look, I\u2019m young, I\u2019m diverse, I\u2019m Latinobama.\n\nAD\n\nThe best moment, though, was his closing statement. \u201cThere was once another man who left his mark on this nation\u2019s history, but he never become president,\u201d before trying to launch into a song from \u201cHamilton.\"\n\nAD\n\nWoody Harrelson returned as Biden, which he debuted when he hosted the season premiere three weeks ago. But without the freshness of seeing his impersonation for the first time, the impersonation didn\u2019t hit quite as hard as, say, Miranda\u2019s. Still, he delivered several solid jokes in a row, such as \u201cThe vast majority of people in America are not homophobic. They\u2019re just scared of gay people.\u201d And \u201cI went to bat for marriage equality, and I believe we\u2019re all equal. Whether your gay, lesby, transgential or queer.\u201d\n\nHe really shined, though, when asked how he would defend his previous support of the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy. \u201cI\u2019m glad you asked that question, and let me answer by telling you a false memory. Now the year was 19,\u201d he began, before clicking his tongue into his cheek a few times and moaning \u201cumm.\u201d Finally, he finished, \u201c26, and I was in downtown Dover with my father.\u201d The story he went on to tell about \u201ctwo well-dressed men,\u201d including a long pause in the middle to ask \u201cWho\u2019s nervous about this story?\u201d perfectly encapsulated the real-life Biden\u2019s propensity for confusing, meandering stories.\n\nAD\n\nTo top it off, he then kissed Moffat\u2019s Cooper.\n\nAD\n\nThe cast members\n\nKate McKinnon once again outshined her fellow cast members by miles. That sentiment is so true that it\u2019s become boring to type. Seriously, what is SNL going to do when she finally moves on? Her Elizabeth Warren both manages to sound and feel like senator while being absurdly over-the-top. Such as tonight, when she bounced around the stage, pointing at the crowd, explaining \u201cI had some apple slices backstage, and they are hitting me like cocaine. Y\u2019all know I\u2019m not a lesbian, but all the ingredients are there.\"\n\nChris Redd\u2019s Cory Booker was amusing, if not particularly memorable. \u201cMy girlfriend was in \u2018Rent,' so yeah, I get it,\u201d he said, referring to his real-life girlfriend Rosario Dawson. When confronted with a 1992 op-ed he penned for the Stanford Daily in which he wrote that he once \u201chated gays,\u201d SNL\u2019s Booker said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m dodging a question, so I\u2019m going to go now.\u201d \u2026 And then he left.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nColin Jost, who doesn\u2019t generally appear on-camera outside of the Weekend Update segment, gave by far the worst performance with his portrayal of Pete Buttigeg. That\u2019s not to say it wasn\u2019t funny. His impersonation is mostly a physical gag, as he walks around with his hands sticking out at his sides like Frankenstein\u2019s monster.\n\nWhile his jokes were funny \u2014 \u201cI went to Harvard, but they don\u2019t teach you where to put your arms\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s no wrong way to be gay, unless you\u2019re Ellen this week\u201d and \u201cWhy am I not winning this? I\u2019m a veteran. I\u2019m under the legal retirement age. And when I talk, it makes sense.\u201d \u2014 he doesn\u2019t do much else to actually impersonate Buttigieg. Instead, he just sounds like, well, Jost during Weekend Update. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that.\n\nAD", "description": "Though the cold open continued relying on guest stars, it was a refreshing change of pace.", "authors": ["Travis M.
