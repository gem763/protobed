They charge you a fortune for skin creams, lotions, potions and masks that are supposed to \u201creverse aging\u201d or \u201crepair DNA damage\u201d or some other bunk. And it\u2019s all bunk\u2014the FDA has repeatedly slapped beauty industry giants for misleading claims and false advertising. The truth is, all the skin creams you\u2019ve ever used only work as a hydrating cream. Everything else is pure marketing malarkey. However, I bring good news today. Because, while expensive beauty creams might not work, there is one substance that\u2019s been proven\u2014in multiple studies\u2014to\n\nYour Body\u2019s Biggest Organ\n\n, fine lines, and skin texture. In as little as six weeks! What\u2019s more, this near-magic substance is easy to find and offers a host of added benefits that, trust me, you\u2019re going to want. But to understand how it works, first, you have to understand why you get wrinkles in the first place.It\u2019s often been said, but it\u2019s usually forgotten:. Lots of people think of it as an inert piece of impermeable flesh, but it\u2019s much more than that. For one thing, your skin let\u2019s in about 60% of what it touches\u2014which is why you need to be especially careful with those fancy chemical-laden skin creams with long ingredient lists . It\u2019s an urban myth that your skin needs to breathe or you\u2019ll die\u2014call it the Goldfinger Legend, after a famous James Bond death scene. But that isn\u2019t true. What is true is that your skin is full of pores, opening and closing, letting substances in, blocking them, or pushing them out. Your skin is less a plastic wrap around your body, and more a layer of sponge that tightens or loosens, depending on conditions. And, of course, your skin plays a huge role in regulating yourthrough sweat. But one of its most important functions is protecting all the rest of your organs from the outside world. That means everything from scraping against the branch of a tree, to stopping damaging UV rays from impacting the rest of your body. It\u2019s that last part we\u2019re most interested in today. As you probably know from countless skincare commercials,\n\nThe Best Skin Antioxidant Around\n\nMost damaging, UV rays can penetrate your cell walls, and alter the DNA inside each cell nuclei. That\u2019s bad news. Damaged DNA can cause cells to malfunction, or even\u2014sometimes\u2014turn cancerous. And your skin is your first defense against that happening to vital organs inside your body. What\u2019s more,can interact with oxygen in your cells to create free radicals\u2014atoms which have unpaired electrons. It\u2019s these free radicals that wreak havoc in your cells. And it\u2019s these free radicals\u2014and the oxidants that cause them\u2014which are largely responsible for aging skin. There are internal factors as well. For instance, starting at around age 20, you start producing 1% less collagen a year.is the building block of the spongey layer of your skin\u2026so, as we lose collagen, we see dips, ridges, and lines forming beneath the surface of our skin. So, while we can\u2019t control aging, in and of itself, we can control\u2014and counteract\u2014some of the causes of aging.There\u2019s one supplement that dominates the competition, when it comes to antioxidant properties: astaxanthin. Astaxanthin is a, like beta-carotene . It has a deep red color\u2014in fact, astaxanthin gives a red tinge to foods rich in it, like shrimp and salmon. And it\u2019s often fed to farm-raised shrimp and salmon to give them that familiar, pink color. Studies show that astaxanthin is unique in its antioxidant properties. It can either give or take electrons, to balance out free radicals (most chemicals can only do one or the other). And it can do so without becoming unbalanced itself. In other words\u2014not only is it an\n\n, but it\u2019s twice as effective as most, and can do the job over and over. And, when it comes to countering the effects of free radical aging on your skin, astaxanthin is a total superstar. After only six week\u2019s use, one study found subjects had a 50% improvement in skin moisture content, a 50% reduction in fine lines and wrinkles, a 50% improvement in skin elasticity, and a 40% reduction in skin roughness. That\u2019s an improvement I\u2019ve never seen duplicated elsewhere.that I\u2019ve ever seen. And, since it is such a powerful antioxidant, it comes with some bonus properties. By eliminating free radicals, it helps prevent and fight cancer and inflammation as well. Astaxanthin is a nutrient we all need. But it\u2019s simply impossible to get enough through diet alone. That\u2019s why I recommend it as a supplement to all of my patients. Be careful what kind you get. Astaxanthin can be created synthetically, but the naturally-occurring version is about three times as powerful. So you want to find a supplement that uses the real deal. But even the synthetic version will do more for your skin than just about anything else out there. And you don\u2019t have to worry about some complicated application, or nighttime rituals. Just take 4 mg every day, orally, and you\u2019re good to go. Forget the ineffective creams, or the expensive anti-aging treatments. All you really need is an astaxanthin supplement every day. It works better and helps clean out the rest of your body at the same time.
