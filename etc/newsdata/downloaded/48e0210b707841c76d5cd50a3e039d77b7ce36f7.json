But if it\u2019s a long trip, then premium economy works fine.\n\nFavourite destination?\n\nEurope is always great. There\u2019s so much diversity within a short distance. Just being part of the day to day is a great way to experience how people like to live. Enjoying a coffee in the morning rush tells you a lot about how they behave and respect each other.\n\nVirgin Galactic's carrier plane at Spaceport America: Hardidge would love to do \"a quick lap of the planet\". AP\n\nFavourite airport?\n\nSingapore\u2019s Changi Airport is the best because there is plenty to do if you have to wait in transit. I have spent a lot of time there exploring the watch and tech shops. I also enjoy the rawness of domestic airports in places like Burma, where you really get the vibe of the community.\n\nIf I ran my own airline I would...\n\nMake the customer experience the number one priority. Consumers have a lot of choice and politeness and being of service does not cost a cent more, but makes a world of difference. Travel is tiring and a genuine smile and support goes a very long way.\n\nWhere would you go with an unlimited travel budget?\n\nI\u2019d take my closest family and friends to Antarctica on a five-star trip to experience the power of nature in this significant place where so few have been. But ultimately, I would like to do a quick lap of the planet on Virgin Galactic \u2013 once they sort out any safety issues.\n\nWorst place you\u2019ve been lost?\n\nNew Orleans late at night. It\u2019s a very scary city to find your way around. I\u2019ll never make that mistake again.\n\nBest trip ever?\n\nFor my 50th birthday, we spent five weeks in Europe \u2013 one week for every decade. We made it a celebration trip and totally indulged. We spent my birthday in Granada, Spain.\n\nMost memorable overseas dining?\n\nVietnam House, Luke Nguyen\u2019s restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City. The food was sensational.", "description": "Watch this space, says Darrell Hardidge, founder of customer experience research and strategy company Saguity.
