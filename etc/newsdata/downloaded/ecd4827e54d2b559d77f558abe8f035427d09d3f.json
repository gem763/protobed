The monthly report provides a snapshot of the American economy. Here\u2019s what to watch for:\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street are predicting a gain of 160,000 jobs, according to Bloomberg, compared with an increase of 164,000 in July.\n\nThe unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged at 3.7 percent . That is close to a 50-year low, and a sign of the labor market\u2019s recent strength.\n\nAverage hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3 percent. That would bring the 12-month increase to 3 percent.\n\nThe Numbers\n\nAfter weeks of rumbles on Wall Street and growing talk about recession prospects, Friday\u2019s report on job growth could provide a clearer picture. A weak number will be cited by pessimists as definitive evidence of an economic slowdown. A healthier showing will be regarded as a sign of the economy\u2019s overall strength, despite problems in manufacturing and other sectors.\n\n\u201cMany of us are on tenterhooks waiting for this set of numbers,\u201d said Carl R. Tannenbaum , chief economist for Northern Trust in Chicago. \u201cBecause of where we are in the business cycle, it\u2019s taken on particular importance.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mr. Tannenbaum is looking for a gain of 135,000 to 150,000 jobs. \u201cNot altogether disappointing, but we\u2019ve gotten used to better,\u201d he said.\n\nFor all the anxiety about the economy, the labor market has held up well. In the first seven months of the year, employers added an average of 165,000 jobs per month. That pace is expected to slow, but anything less than a gain of 100,000 jobs last month would point to future weakness.", "description": "The trade war and a global slowdown have not yet knocked hiring off course, and analysts expect another solid gain in employment.", "authors": ["Nelson D.
