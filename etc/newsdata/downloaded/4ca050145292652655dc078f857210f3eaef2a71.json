They tried to flee in their car but other motorists managed to block the road.\n\nA group of residents then attacked the suspects and beat them with sticks, rocks, cement blocks and a sjambok, among others.\n\nIt was then that a group of men held down one of the suspects, pulled down his pants and cut off his penis.\n\nThe police were informed about the incident and managed to rescue the alleged thieves from the mob.\n\nNgoepe said the suspects were all well-known residents of the Rivati settlement near Tzaneen.\n\nThe man who lost his penis was transferred to the nearby Elim Hospital. Paramedics had apparently put his dismembered penis in a box of ice and handed it to the hospital.\n\nNgoepe confirmed the man was in a critical condition.\n\nThe other two suspects, who were assaulted, have been discharged and are currently in police custody until their appearance in court later this week.", "description": "A suspected bank card thief is fighting for his life in a Limpopo hospital after a group of residents attacked him and cut off his penis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9136/6ebffede585c4a0e8757a555ec1ba8a3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
