Pieces were falling in our laps,' he said.\n\nMr Pearce said the owners council received a complaint from a neighbouring apartment block that the tree was dropping foliage over the fence.\n\nThe tree is about 20cm from the retaining wall the fence sits on, and about two metres from the neighbouring building.\n\n'We consulted a series of arborists who all said the best course of action was to cut down the tree,' Mr Pearce said.\n\n'We'd be quite silly to not follow what the experts told us.'\n\nThe tree is at 99 Ninth Avenue in the Perth suburb of Maylands and holds 24 units of which Mr Kozak is the owner of one\n\nThe three-person owners council was elected by the owners of units in the complex from among its members in July\n\nMr Pearce said the tree, which is native to Australia but not to the area, was not an appropriate species for the spot, but could be replaced with another tree.\n\n'If we don't do anything about it, we could be legally liable if a branch fell into the neighbour's property and damaged something,' he said.\n\n'The cheapest thing to do would be just to trim it but that's not going to solve the long-term problem.'\n\nThe committee further explained in an email to Mr Kozak: 'The consensus expert opinion from the tree surgeons was that the tree appears to be termite damaged, is about half the size it will eventually get to...\n\n'[It] is planted in the wrong place and will affect the foundations of both the retaining wall, the paving and the house next door if not removed.'\n\nThe committee considers removing the tree to be a maintenance issue, which doesn;t need to be voted on by all the owners.\n\nMr Pearce is planning to lodge his own SAT application to force the tree to be removed.\n\nMr Pearce said the owners council received a complaint from a neighbouring apartment block that the tree was dropping foliage over the fence\n\nA 'legal notice' outlining the pair's arguments is now tied to the tree's trunk, threatening prosecution for anyone who cuts it down\n\nMr Kozak said he disagreed with the assessment of the tree and relied on a 2007 ruling by the NSW Land and Environment Court as precedent.\n\n'The dropping of leaves, flowers, fruit, seeds or small elements of deadwood by urban trees ordinarily will not provide the basis for ordering removal of or intervention with an urban tree,' the ruling read.\n\nA 'legal notice' outlining the pair's arguments is now tied to the tree's trunk, threatening prosecution for anyone who cuts it down.\n\nMr Kozak also wants the councillors removed and a new committee installed.\n\nThe three-person council was elected by the owners of units in the complex from among its members in July.\n\nAnother issue was more than a dozen plants the pair planted on the verge outside the building that Mr Pearce wanted removed\n\nMr Pearce got a got a gardener (pictured) to remove them but I didn't give him a written job order so Mr Kozak called the police and the worker left\n\nMr Pearce said Mr Kozak and the other rebel owner complained about a range of decisions by the current and previous strata committees.\n\nAnother issue was more than a dozen plants the pair planted on the verge outside the building that Mr Pearce wanted removed.\n\n'We got a gardener to remove them but I didn't give the poor bloke a written job order, I just rung him, so they called the police,' he said.\n\nMr Pearce said he has since gotten written permission from Bayswater Council to remove the plants and given Mr Kozak until Saturday to take them out himself.\n\nBoth issues will be heard at the SAT at a date yet to be determined.", "description": "Owners council of a Perth apartment block wants to cut down a 30-year-old silky oak in the courtyard but two residents sat at the base of it and prevented a work crew from cutting it down.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/04/19424862-0-image-a-60_1570503646997.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
