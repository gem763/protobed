( MU ) is the Stock of the Day at Real Money as it trades lower in pre-market activity here on Friday after forecasting first-quarter earnings below analyst expectations. Let's dive into the charts and indicators to see if this is the start of a decline or an opportunity to buy a dip.\n\nIn this daily chart of MU, below, we need to imagine price about 5% lower here on Friday. An opening around $46 would mean a test of the cresting 50-day moving average line and the top of a possible support area from $45.75 to $42 or so. The rising 200-day moving average line is well below the market but the daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line was declining the past two weeks, telling us that sellers of MU were more aggressive ahead of the earnings announcement. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator made a lower high in September versus July, which is a bearish divergence when compared to the price action making higher highs.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of MU, below, we see a mixed picture technically speaking. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line, so the trend is up. Trading volume has declined the past three months, which is not bullish, and the weekly OBV line has been flat the past two months, signaling a balance between aggressive buyers and aggressive sellers. The MACD oscillator is above the zero line and rising, and that is a positive.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of MU, below, there is a downside price target of $45.60 projected. We could see that target reached here on Friday.\n\nBottom line strategy: I hate being wishy-washy about recommendations and I hate Delphic commentary, but I think I want to see how MU opens, trades and closes before deciding whether it is a buying opportunity or the start of a deeper decline.", "description": "Let's watch how Micron Technologies (MU) opens, trades and closes before deciding whether to throw it under the bus after it forecast first-quarter earnings below analysts expectations or to consider a decline in the shares as a buying opportunity....MU", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Watch How Micron Trades Before Throwing It Under The Bus", "Let'S See How The Semiconductor Company Opens", "Trades", "Closes Before Deciding If It Is A Buying Opportunity Or The Start Of A Deeper Decline.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Alex Frew Mcmillan", "Bob Ciura", "Bret Jensen", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/9365c9c8-b68f-11e8-89b6-39895f6d49a9.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
