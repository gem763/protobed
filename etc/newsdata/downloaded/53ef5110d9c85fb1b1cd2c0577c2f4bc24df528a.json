REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo\n\nPrice Waterhouse (PW) was the auditor for the erstwhile software services exporter Satyam Computer Services, whose founder admitted in 2009 that the firm had overstated earnings and assets for several years.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) last year barred all entities practicing as chartered accountants in India under the Price Waterhouse brand from auditing listed companies over the firm\u2019s role in the fraud of more than $1 billion, referred to as \u201cIndia\u2019s Enron\u201d.\n\nIn a ruling on Monday, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) said there was \u201cno shred of evidence\u201d to show that the audit firm had fabricated or falsified Satyam\u2019s books in collusion with the top management.\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, the approach adopted by the WTM is patently erroneous and is flawed,\u201d SAT said, referring to the 108-page order by a SEBI whole-time member (WTM) in January 2018.\n\nSEBI and PwC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. After the ban, PwC denied any involvement in the fraud.\n\nIn India, PwC audits under the Price Waterhouse brand, with a network of local firms operating under the banner. The broader PwC entity handles consulting, tax advisory and other services.\n\nSAT said that the ban affected 98 partners of Price Waterhouse, 70 of whom were not part of the firm during the period of the fraud.\n\nThe tribunal also said it took \u201cnine long years\u201d for SEBI to complete the proceedings, during which time the audit firm adopted \u201cextensive remedial measures\u201d and audited companies \u201cwithout any blemish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus looking from this angle also, the order of debarment was not the appropriate choice,\u201d SAT said.\n\nSAT said there was no doubt about professional negligence by the auditors but that such misconduct should be handled by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).", "description": "An Indian tribunal on Monday overturned an order by the market regulator banning the Indian affiliate of accounting giant PwC from auditing listed companies in the country for two years over its role in a nearly decade-old accounting fraud case.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427988037&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881BR", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
