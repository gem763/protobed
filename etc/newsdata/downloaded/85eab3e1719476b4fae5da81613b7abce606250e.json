But none of them seemed to offer new solutions for improving health quality and outcomes while decreasing costs. With Respiratory Care Week almost coming to an end, it seems the perfect time to consider how respiratory therapists can positively influence all three measures.\n\nRespiratory therapists are allied-health professionals who identify, treat and prevent acute and chronic conditions related to the cardiopulmonary system. Their training is diverse and rigorous, and they care for patients across the age spectrum.\n\nChildren born prematurely often need a respiratory therapist to help them take their first breath. These medical professionals first assess trauma patients when they arrive at the hospital. Persons with chronic lung disease can often avoid hospitalizations and have improved quality of life thanks to the treatment they receive from a respiratory therapist. They work in hospitals, clinics, home care, research labs and universities. But too many patients don\u2019t know that respiratory therapists may be the best health professional to provide their respiratory care needs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRespiratory therapists are not a solution looking for a problem, they are necessary. According to the Center for Disease Control, chronic lower respiratory diseases are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, with influenza and pneumonia coming not far behind. Non-respiratory conditions like heart disease, cancer, stroke and kidney disease have a tremendous impact on our society, too. Respiratory therapists care for patients with all these conditions and more daily.\n\nRespiratory therapists can also be part of the solution for the astronomical costs in health care. A 2018 study demonstrated that they could yield both direct and indirect cost reductions across an array of respiratory care practices.\n\nCost-savings were noted by the utilization of protocols that guide decision-making, assessment skills, and the performance of some invasive procedures independently. As a respiratory therapist myself, I am pleased to know that we help decrease health care costs.\n\nHowever, I am more pleased that patient outcomes, such as intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay, allocation of therapies, and hospital readmissions are improved by our services.\n\nRespiratory therapists can also help close the quality gap for patients that suffer from chronic respiratory conditions. Currently, activists are working to pass legislation that would allow qualified providers tele-health services for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Better Respiration through Expanding Access to Telehealth Act (the BREATHE Act) would allow respiratory therapists under the direct supervision of a physician, to provide services such as patient education, inhaler technique evaluation, smoking cessation, and remote physiologic monitoring.\n\nExpanding access to care through means such as telemedicine is particularly timely, as there is a projected shortfall of physicians in the near future. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the United States will see a shortage of physicians, of up to nearly 122,000 by 2032. A recent study identified a current shortage of cardiopulmonary care providers, which may worsen further, with the projected overall physician shortage.\n\nTo be sure, education standards of the profession have struggled to keep pace with advancements in technology, disease management, and patient care. The relatively low entry-level education requirements have not matched the educational advancement of other allied-health professionals, which has affected the perception of this profession. Fortunately, this is being addressed.\n\nRecently, the American Association for Respiratory Care recommended that all therapists entering the workforce in 2030 obtain a minimum of a bachelor\u2019s degree in the field.\n\nThis was not an attack on the many qualified respiratory therapists, like myself, who entered the profession with an associate\u2019s degree. Instead, this forward-looking recommendation will better prepare respiratory therapists to meet clinical demands in an ever-changing health care system and to be recognized for their expertise.\n\nThere are already several bachelor and master\u2019s degree entry-level programs today, and many respiratory therapists are going back to higher education to complete their degrees. As the responsibilities of the respiratory therapist continue to increase, we can expect more of these programs to become available.\n\nRespiratory therapists, like myself, often go unnoticed by patients, even as we oversee the devices that keep them breathing. We are often overlooked by hospital administration, as well. But we may be one of the best-kept secrets in health care.\n\nRespiratory therapists can provide high quality, compassionate, and outcome-driven care, all while reducing costs and improving quality of life. However, much of our work is limited by unnecessary constraints. Updating federal laws can make this happen.\n\nJonathan B.
