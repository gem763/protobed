Reminder: There are 122 days until the Iowa caucuses and 396 days until the 2020 election\n\nIt\u2019s clear, at this point, that President Trump should be very worried about Ukraine, with a flurry of damning details emerging Thursday: a report in the Wall Street Journal that he ordered the removal of the ambassador to Ukraine after months of complaints from his allies that she was obstructing efforts to investigate Joe Biden; a report in the New York Times that two of Trump\u2019s top envoys to Ukraine drafted a statement for the country's new president in August that would have committed Ukraine to pursuing such investigations; and a trove of newly released, smoking-gun-like text messages showing that U.S. ambassadors pushed President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden as a condition for a White House visit.\n\nSo, yes, Trump should be worried. But how worried should Joe Biden be?\n\nFor the record, before we proceed: As the Obama administration\u2019s point person on Ukraine, Biden pushed for the removal of a prosecutor who was failing to pursue corruption and who both the administration and the international community wanted out. The prosecutor was not investigating Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, and Biden was not freelancing for personal reasons. In fact, Ukrainian officials have said the Burisma probe was focused on the years 2010 to 2012, before Hunter Biden joined the board. Removing the prosecutor actually made it more likely \u2014 not less \u2014 that corruption would be investigated, including any involving Burisma. End of story.\n\nThe problem for Biden is that while he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, Trump and his allies have spent the past 10 days throwing up smoke and saying he did \u2014 including publicly calling on China to look into the Bidens. And now they\u2019re putting a ton of money behind their allegations.\n\nEarlier this week, the Trump campaign announced a $10 million national TV buy centered on impeachment and Ukraine; yesterday, the campaign revealed that $1 million of that sum will be spent on anti-Biden commercials in the key early primary states of Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada. Called \u201cBiden corruption,\u201d the ad in question is so misleading that CNN has already refused to air it.\n\n\u201cCNN is rejecting the ad, as it does not meet our advertising standards,\u201d a network spokesperson told the Daily Beast. \u201cSpecifically, in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\u201d\n\nBut other networks and local stations are not obligated to do the same, and the Trump campaign has enough cash to keep pumping out anti-Biden spin indefinitely (including on Facebook, where Trump spent more than $2 million over the past week and plans to spend another $1 million attacking Biden). According to new filings, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the third quarter of the year \u2014 five times as much as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who were the quarter\u2019s leading Democratic fundraisers, and nearly double what Barack Obama had raised at the same point in his 2012 reelection bid. Right now, the Trump campaign claims it has $156 million in cash on hand, which is likely more than every Democratic candidate combined.\n\nPresident Trump (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP) More\n\nDemocrats are plainly concerned. According to interviews by Politico with nearly 20 Democratic National Committee members and other prominent Dems, there are \u201ccomplaints that the national party isn\u2019t delivering a digital counterpunch, that it\u2019s getting swamped by Republican fundraising, and \u2026 that Democrats lack a prominent voice who is providing anything like the kind of sustained bombast coming from the Republican side.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s clear, at this point, that President Trump should be very worried about Ukraine, with a flurry of damning details emerging recently.
