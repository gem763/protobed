And there\u2019s a separate 2,153-square-foot guest house.\n\n\n\nThe successful bidder will also be immediately eligible for a full membership at the Grey Oaks Country Club, according to Randy Haddaway, CEO and founder of Elite Auctions.\n\n\n\n\u201cNaples is one of the most premier, if not the premier city, in all of Florida for golfing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I would say this is the top location within Naples.\u201d\n\n\n\nOwned by Craig Brown, the owner of the South Carolina-based minor league baseball team Greenville Drive, who are affiliated with the Boston Red Sox, the home was most recently listed for $7.95 million. But it first came on the market in February 2016 for $12 million, according to listing records. That listing was removed at the end of 2017.\n\n\n\nThe home was relisted in January 2018 for just under $10 million, but still has not found a buyer, even at its lower price. Now Mr. Brown is looking to \u201cmotivate the market\u201d with an auction, Mr. Haddaway said. At the end of the day on Nov. 2, the house will be sold, he added.\n\n\n\nMore: U.S. Housing Supply Declines for First Time in a Year\n\nMr. Brown bought the property in 2008 for $922,500, according to property records. Now he and his family have \u201cdecided to downsize and move out of state,\u201d Mr. Haddaway explained. Mr. Brown was not immediately available for comment.\n\n\n\nNaples-based Stofft Cooney Architects designed the residence, which was inspired by homes in the West Indies, according to the listing. The property has two pools, manicured gardens and several patios and terraces to make the most of Florida\u2019s endless summer weather.\n\n\n\nThe main house has the clean lines of a modern home, featuring a formal living room with garden views and a bar, a sitting room with a fireplace and an eat-in kitchen with exposed beams, custom cabinetry and Viking and Miele appliances.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta Why Hotels Are Getting Guests Up Close and Personal With Their Favorite Drinks\n\nPocket sliding doors lead out to a loggia, which boasts a summer kitchen, automated screens and shutters, a heated pool and views of the golf course\u2019s eighth fairway and private preserve beyond. The second pool is a linear reflecting pool, and there\u2019s a gazebo and gas fire pit.\n\n\n\nOther features include a master suite with a private study and sitting area, a media room, a climate-controlled 1,000 bottle wine cellar, a 12-camera security system, two separate two-car garages and a golf cart garage.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["V.L.
