Scientists may finally know", "language": "en", "text": "(CNN) The sun may be the focal point of our solar system, but astronomers are still trying to understand some strange processes that unfold on the star, including sunspots.\n\nSunspots show up like dark spots on the sun's surface. And every 11 years, the number of sunspots peaks.\n\nNew research, rooted in fusion energy research, suggests that some of the sun's unusual features that are visible to us through telescopes actually happen in a thin layer located under the sun's surface. A study using this new model was published Thursday in the journal Physics of Plasmas\n\nThis layer is made up of plasma, or free-floating electrons, and magnetic flux -- the measurement of a magnetic field force in a specific area.\n\nThese things flow at different speeds, which creates magnetic twists. This behavior is not unlike what happens in a fusion reactor.\n\nRead More", "description": "The sun may be the focal point of our solar system, but astronomers are still trying to understand some strange processes that unfold on the star, including sunspots.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190920112128-sunspots-mystery-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
