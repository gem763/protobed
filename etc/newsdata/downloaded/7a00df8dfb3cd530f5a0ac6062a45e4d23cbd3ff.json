The cyclone centered at about 750 km southwest of Karachi and 1080 km northeast of Salalah (Oman).\n\nKyarr is likely to move further northwestwards during next 36 hours and then turn southwestward.\n\nThe met office has said there is no direct threat to any coastal area of Pakistan, but, due to exceptionally strong winds around the system\u2019s centre and roughness in sea, low-lying islands may suffer by water intrusion due to high tides.\n\nThe weather department has also predicted scattered dust storm or thunderstorm with rain in lower Sindh and along Makran Coast expected from Wednesday to Friday.\n\nThe fishermen are advised not to venture in open sea till 31 Oct.\n\nAccording to the National Center of Meteorology of UAE, high tides were reported along the coast of Fujairah.\n\nThe NCM has issued a yellow warning for residents to stay alert.\n\nVideos circulating online show an increase in water levels along coastal parts of Fujairah, with water flowing into roads, thus affecting motorists.\n\nAdditionally, the cyclone might cause strong winds to blow over parts of the UAE, with estimated wind speeds of 170-km/h to 200-km/h.\n\nNCM said storm Kyarr is expected to weaken to a category one cyclone and change course by Wednesday at 4:00 pm, moving west-southwest.\n\nCyclone Kyarr: What NASA says\n\nMoreover, the NASA\u2019s Global Precipitation Measurement mission or GPM core passed over Kyarr from its orbit in space and measured rainfall rates throughout the storm.\n\nGPM found the heaviest rainfall stretching from the northern to the eastern side of the storm where it was falling at a rate of over 40 mm (about 1.6 inches) per hour.\n\nAccording to NASA Kyarr is moving west and is forecast to start weakening within 24 hours. The storm is then predicted to turn to the west-southwest while slowly weakening as it approaches the Gulf of Aden.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cyclone-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
