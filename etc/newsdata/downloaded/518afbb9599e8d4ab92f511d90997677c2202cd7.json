REUTERS/James Akena/File Photo\n\nKAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan pop star and presidential hopeful Bobi Wine has denounced the government\u2019s banning of civilian use of red berets, a symbol of his \u201cPeople Power\u201d movement that he hopes to use to oust longtime President Yoweri Museveni.\n\nThe government this month gazetted the red beret and other pieces of military wear as \u201cproperty of the state.\u201d It warned people who wear or sell them that they would be prosecuted under military law, which can lead to a life sentence.\n\n\u201cThis beret ban is a sham. It is a blatant attempt to suffocate a successful threat to the autocratic status quo,\u201d Wine, 37, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBut People Power is more than a red beret, we are bigger than our symbol. We are a booming political movement fighting for the future of Uganda and we will continue our struggle for democracy,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSince he became a legislator in 2017, Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has rattled Ugandan authorities who see him as a formidable threat to end Museveni\u2019s more than three decades in power.\n\nWine has amassed a large support base especially among young Ugandans who have been wooed by his bold criticism of Museveni, sometimes delivered in his lyrics.\n\nAuthorities have responded by clamping down on his supporters, jailing some. Wine\u2019s rallies have been broken up with tear gas and live rounds.\n\nLast year he was beaten as he campaigned in a parliamentary by-election and had to seek treatment in the United States.\n\nUganda\u2019s next presidential elections are due to be held early 2021. Museveni, president since 1986, is widely expected to stand. While Museveni has not officially declared his intention to run for re-election but top organs of his ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party have endorsed him as their flagbearer.", "description": "Ugandan pop star and presidential hopeful Bobi Wine has denounced the government's banning of civilian use of red berets, a symbol of his \"People Power\" movement that he hopes to use to oust longtime President Yoweri Museveni.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435792932&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9024F-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
