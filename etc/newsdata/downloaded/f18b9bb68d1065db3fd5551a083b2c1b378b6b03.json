A lot of cooperation is also needed between airport providers and airlines, especially as we move forward on customer elements like self-service,\" she said.\n\nShe said Comair embraces competition and airspace liberalisation.\n\n'Compete aggressively'\n\n\"We compete aggressively in the full-service and low cost carrier market,\" she said.\n\nShe admitted that in the low-cost market, Flysafair has given kulula.com \"a run for its money\".\n\n\"But that is the nature of business. Aviation is like any other business. The Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) should be about customer needs and recognising that airlines are businesses, which should be allowed to compete and have the right professionals to run them. To me SAATM is not a silver bullet, but it will contribute to ensuring better aviation services in Africa.\"\n\nElmar Conradie, CEO of low-cost airline Flysafair, said their business model is to keep things as simple as possible and keep costs down. He agreed that it is about what customers want.\n\n\"There is a role for every type of carrier to play \u2013 low-cost airlines, full service airlines and those with hybrid models,\" he commented.\n\nHe noted that customers want to pay as little as possible.\n\n\"Low-cost airlines normally have a specific market type. We are not feeder airlines or connectors. We, therefore, rely on the middle class, so we depend on a growing middle class and growing economy. The same would go for the potential success of low-cost airlines in the rest of Africa. They would need a growing middle class to be sustainable.\"\n\nAs for implementing SAATM, he said the best way to do it would be to start bit by bit with individual agreements.\n\nHe also emphasised that there must be a reason for people to use specific airline routes.\n\n\"Let the market do what the market needs to do without interference. Some people said the greater number of direct international flights to Cape Town will impact Flysafair, but we found that, from there, visitors also fly to other destinations in SA and the southern African region, and that is where our domestic flights play a role again.\"\n\nFin24 was a guest of AASA at its AGM.", "description": "Focus on what consumers actually want instead of trying to copy US and European aviation liberation models, say the CEOs of Comair and Flysafair..", "authors": ["Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7953/5371c4f16cc5484c8c34a6efb5dd1389.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
