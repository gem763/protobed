We had about 60-70,000 votes,\u2019 Piers said as he addressed the worrying stats.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s now been hijacked by these snowflake websites and Twitter handles, so all last night they were like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get rid of him, get rid of him!\u201d, they actually think they can get rid of me.\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018We\u2019ve now had over 300,000 votes, one of the biggest in the history of the show, and it\u2019s now moved 59% against me, now viewers, you\u2019re not the snowflake brigade, you are my people.\n\nThe poll was launched on Monday and runs for another 23 hours (Picture: Twitter)\n\n\u2018You are my army, I need you to get busy this morning. We cannot let the snowflakes win.\u2019\n\nIt was announced over the weekend that Piers would be debating whether he should face the sack from Good Morning Britain after angry viewers launched a petition to get him removed.\n\nSo far over 16,863 people have signed a Change.org campaign calling for Piers\u2019 termination.\n\n\u2018Morgan dictates to his viewers that it\u2019s acceptable to deny an LGBTQ+ person of their rights; it\u2019s acceptable to tell them they don\u2019t exist; it\u2019s acceptable to call them \u201csnowflakes\u201d when they get rightfully upset,\u2019 part of the petition\u2019s description reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018These are the lessons Morgan teaches. ITV, as a major broadcasting corporation with a worldwide reach, are currently tarnishing a long-lasting legacy by using one of their highest-performing programmes as a vehicle to spread hate and intolerance.\u2019\n\nUpon learning the news of the movement, Piers begged his fans to keep him in his job and one loyal follower set up a separate campaign to keep him at the helm of Good Morning Britain.\n\nAt the time of writing, 36,691 people have signed the other Change.org petition.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
