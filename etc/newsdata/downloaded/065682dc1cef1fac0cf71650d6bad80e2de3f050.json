If Boris Johnson\u2019s ex-wife wants to finally get proper maintenance for their kids, she should become a DUP MP, she\u2019d be given a billion quid by Tuesday.\n\nIt makes sense at the next election for us all to vote DUP. Then in areas such as Epsom, the mayor could announce \u201cthis year, instead of a parade led by the Women\u2019s Institute, we\u2019re going to hold an Orange march through the kitchen of Mr O\u2019Reilly who we think is Catholic\u201d, and they\u2019d receive \u00a350m every time they threatened to vote against the government.\n\nThese are the tactics we must hope secure approval for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. It\u2019s so important it\u2019s passed, that you can understand him saying, \u201cRight, here\u2019s the deal, there\u2019s no point in dragging things out by looking at it, there are quite a lot of numbers in there and they always hold things up.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSo we shouldn\u2019t get bogged down in the details of the deal, such as what\u2019s in it. The main thing is it\u2019s been approved by Boris Johnson, and if you can\u2019t trust the word of Boris Johnson, who CAN you trust?\n\nThis must be how he\u2019s won round Conservatives who have, in the past, been slightly sceptical about the EU. For example Jacob Rees-Mogg said of Theresa May\u2019s deal, it made us a \u201cvassal state\u201d, like Britain under the Roman occupation.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

And I for one am SICK of being FREE to move where I WANT. If my kids want to work or study in Spain, I want them to be told \u201cNO. You STAY where you ARE. If anyone wants to go anywhere different they can go to the Co-op.\u201d\n\nAnd crucially, the tricky issue of Ireland has been resolved. Through vigour we have secured agreements from the EU they were never willing to consider before. For example, Boris Johnson said no prime minister could ever sign up to a border in the Irish Sea, but now through determined negotiating, he\u2019s got them to agree to a border in the Irish Sea.\n\nHopefully he\u2019ll be as vigorous with Donald Trump, and insist so strongly that he will never sell off bits of the NHS to US companies, that Trump ends up agreeing to buying all the NHS for US companies.\n\nBut most importantly, this deal represents a return to our beloved democracy, in which we\u2019re free to make our own laws, in line with our glorious parliament. Instead of sneaky dealings behind closed doors, we can go back to making decisions by giving hundreds of millions of pounds to Presbyterians so they vote the way we want.\n\nTo be fair, no one can accuse the DUP of not meeting the people, because this week, before being invited into Downing Street to discuss Johnson\u2019s deal, they had meetings with the paramilitary Ulster Defence Association to see what they thought.\n\nMaybe this is why Conservatives attack Jeremy Corbyn for \u201cmeeting Sinn Fein leaders in the 1980s\u201d; they think he should still be meeting the IRA now, and to no longer consult them is a bit rude.\n\nPerhaps if the deal goes through, we\u2019ll see a new spirit of cooperation between the government and loyalist gunmen, and the Ulster Defence Association will pop into Downing Street directly, with Johnson saying, \u201cwould you er, ipso facto as it were, care for an Earl Grey, Mr Mad Dog?\u201d\n\nAnd he replies, \u201cI find it difficult to drink tea through a balaclava, so I do\u201d.\n\nSo the main thing is not to spend any more time pontificating how we make the country into a poorer and more doolally tinpot outfit, with a handful of sociopaths creaming off everything they can grab with no regulations whatsoever. What the whole country wants now is just to GET IT DONE.", "description": "This new deal with the EU raises many issues, but here\u2019s one that some people have overlooked.
