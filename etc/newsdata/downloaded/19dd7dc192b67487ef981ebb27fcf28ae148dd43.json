Because of his age, he cannot be held in custody between hearings.\n\nThe inferno near the village of Goodfield killed his two half-siblings, one-year-old Ariel and two-year-old Daemeon Wall; and his cousin, Rose Alwood, aged two.\n\nKyle's stepfather, 34-year-old Jason Wall, and the children's maternal great-grandmother, 69-year-old Kathryn Murray were also killed in the incident.\n\nAll five victims died of smoke inhalation inside the family's trailer at Timberline Mobile Home Park.\n\nEarlier this month, his mother Katrina Alwood told CBS This Morning that the child suffers from a mental illness and is not a monster.\n\nKatrina, who was engaged to Jason, and her son from a previous relationship, Kyle, then eight years old, were the only people who managed to escape the burning residence.\n\nThe 27-year-old mother told CBS that Kyle had been recently diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and ADHD. She also revealed that the boy in the past had shown interest in lighters and fire.\n\n'Everyone is looking at him like he's some kind of monster, but that's not who he is,' Alwood told the news outlet. 'People make mistakes, and that's what this is. Yes, it was a horrible tragedy, but it's still not something to throw his life away over.'\n\nThe arson fire claimed the lives of two-year-old Daemeon Wall (left) and his one-year-old sister, Ariel Wall (right)\n\nThe siblings' father, US Army veteran Jason Wall, 34, also died of smoke inhalation\n\nNiece Rose Alwood, aged two, was staying with the Wall family and perished in the blaze\n\nDaemeon, Ariel and Kyle's great-grandmother, Kathryn Murray, 69, was killed in the fire\n\nKatrina recounted during the emotional interview how she stood at the window of her burning home and told her toddler son and daughter she was sorry she could not save them.\n\n'Mommy was right here and I loved them,' Katrina recalled telling her dying children. 'You know, so, at least hopefully they heard that. I told Jason I loved him... And then something told me that they're gone.'\n\nKatrina also talked about hearing her fiance scream, and choked back tears remembering the moment the screams ceased.\n\nDespite the heartbreak caused by her son, Katrina is hoping the judge will take into account his mental health problems and will show leniency.\n\n'I forgive him. I love him no matter what,\u2019 the mom said of Kyle.\n\nKatrina Alwood said earlier this month that her son Kyle is not 'some kind of monster.'
