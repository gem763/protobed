A grand entrance to spacious comfort.\u201d\n\nThe qualification that the Lincoln was unique among American cars was necessary because a number of European automakers have produced cars with such doors; Rolls-Royce still does.\n\nThe 1960s Continental was a clean-sheet design that rejected the gaudy fins-and-chrome 1950s design aesthetic for something much more understated. Lincoln design lost its way in the 1970s, but the company is consciously trying to get back to the elegance that began when Eugene T. Gregorie created a unique and gorgeous Continental for the personal use of Edsel Ford (son of Henry ) in 1939.\n\nThis year is the 80th anniversary of that car, and Lincoln celebrated by producing 80 2019 Continental Coach Door Editions, with those iconic center-opening doors. The cars, priced at $110,000, sold out in two days. Clearly, there was a market for exclusive, luxury Lincolns.\n\nOn Oct. 4, Lincoln announced that it was bringing back the Coach Door Continental, based on the Black Label model, for 2020. The order books are open until the end of the month, with plans to build 150. The price has gone up more than $5,000 to $116,465. Delivery of the cars will begin next spring.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how many Coach Door cars Lincoln sells by the end of the month. Was the demand satisfied by that first 80? It seems unlikely. Buyers of those first cars were aware there was going to be a second offering\u2014otherwise they could raise objections to their exclusive cars suddenly becoming less exclusive.\n\nMatt DeLorenzo, managing editor at Kelley Blue Book, tells Penta, \u201cLincoln made it clear last year that they were going to do two installments of 80 cars each\u2026the price increase reflects some additional standard equipment this year.\u201d\n\nLincoln Brand Marketing Manager Trevor Scott says the first few 2019 Coach Door models are now being delivered with \u201cslightly different content\u201d from the 2020. Asked how sales are going, a few days into the program, he said, \u201cThe early response is very encouraging.\u201d He declined to rule out a 2021 model, and said that although the Coach Door is so far exclusive to the U.S. market, it could eventually be offered elsewhere, including China. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen many sedan segments shrink in the U.S., but it\u2019s more stable in China,\u201d Scott says.\n\nThe Continental was brought back in part for the Chinese luxury market, where chauffeurs are frequently employed. The Coach Door includes a chauffeur button, which slides the front passenger seat all the way forward, giving even more rear legroom.\n\nThe wide door opening makes rear entry and egress easy. Lincoln photo\n\nThe 1961 Continental introduced both the center-opening doors and a chrome-accented shoulder line \u201cthat established a signature look for Lincoln,\u201d Scott says. He added that the 80th anniversary car \u201cis a celebration of the form and function of that vehicle, which captured the hearts of car enthusiasts around the world.\u201d It \u201coffers a nod to heritage while providing refinements for today\u2019s discerning luxury client.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 Black Label with regular doors sells for $76,465. To enlarge the rear passenger compartment, Coach Door cars have had their wheelbase extended by six inches, and the rear doors (which open 90 degrees) are longer than the stock items. The conversion was carried out not by Lincoln itself, but by Cabot Coach Builders of Haverhill, Mass., which also custom-fits the Scottish Bridge of Weir leather upholstery.\n\nStandard in the 2020 Coach Door car are what amounts to a rear work space, with a console that extends into a table, complementing a pair of holders for tablets or notebook computers, wireless charging, a pair of USB outlets, and a 110-volt plug. Rear passengers also get controls for the audio and climate systems, and a four-inch screen.\n\nThe rear doors also house holders for umbrellas, should inclement weather occur. This is a famous Rolls-Royce feature. Illuminated aluminum rear-door sills dress up the package. The car will be available in black, metallic white, and \u201ccrystal blue.\u201d\n\nPower comes from a twin-turbocharged three-liter V6, and the car offers all-wheel drive. That should be entertaining for chauffeurs, who will definitely pilot some of these cars. Scott says that buyers of the 2019 model were \u201can assortment of enthusiasts for the Lincoln brand, car collectors, and people who intend to use their Coach Door cars as daily drivers.\u201d", "description": "The company celebrated the 80th anniversary of the Continental by producing an edition of 80 units, with more on the way in 2020", "authors": ["Jim Motavalli"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-114844/social", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
