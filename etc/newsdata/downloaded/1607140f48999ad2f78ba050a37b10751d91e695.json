My hope is that the Democrats will use it as a starting point for negotiations, but that may not happen.\n\nAccording to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerMcCarthy shares 'Stranger Things' parody video criticizing impeachment 2020 Democrats push for gun control action at forum O'Rourke hits Buttigieg over not supporting mandatory gun buybacks: 'It's time to lead' MORE (D-N.Y.), Trump \"can't be serious\" about reaching a deal when he starts out with proposals that are \"anathema\" to the Democrats.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat is an interesting comment in view of their support for the Senate\u2019s two major immigration reform bills, both of which were\n\nan anathema to the Republicans\n\n.\n\nOn May 25, 2006, the Senate passed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, S. 2611. Although it had some bipartisan support, it was opposed by 58 percent of the Senate Republicans.\n\nThen, on June 27, 2013, the Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, S. 744. This one was written by a bipartisan group of eight senators known as the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d but it was opposed by 70 percent of the Senate Republicans.\n\nBoth were dead-on-arrival in the Republican-controlled House.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte Robert (Bob) William GoodlatteUSCIS chief Cuccinelli blames Paul Ryan for immigration inaction Immigrant advocacy groups shouldn't be opposing Trump's raids Top Republican releases full transcript of Bruce Ohr interview MORE (R-Va.), summarized the Republican objections in a press release:\n\n\u201cWhile I congratulate the Senate for working hard to produce immigration reform legislation, I have many concerns about its bill. The bill repeats many of the same mistakes made in the 1986 immigration law (IRCA), which got us into this mess in the first place. Among my many concerns, the Senate bill does not adequately address the interior enforcement of our immigration laws and allows the Executive Branch to waive many, if not most, of the bill\u2019s requirements.\u201d\n\nTrump took a more productive approach for saving the DACA participants. Instead of putting together a bill with the Republicans and recruiting a few Democrats to support it, he started with Democratic leaders Pelosi and Schumer and brokered a tentative agreement.\n\nI do not want that tentative agreement to fail, and both parties should feel the same way. According to a Gallup poll released last week, Americans think that Congress is performing poorly. \u201cJust 20 percent approve of the job Republicans in Congress are doing, the lowest to date in Gallup's 18-year trend. Congressional Democrats' 31 percent approval rating is better than the GOP's, but also near the low point for the party.\u201d\n\nA two-step proposal.\n\nFirst, establish a permanent DACA program, and second, use Trump\u2019s list as the starting point for negotiating a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would meet the essential political needs of both parties.\n\nThe DACA program.\n\nThe number of undocumented aliens who might benefit from a DREAM Act would range from 2.5 to 3.3 million. It isn\u2019t likely that an agreement will be reached if the Democrats insist on a DACA program that would be open to that many undocumented aliens.\n\nThe number should be reduced by applying a point-based system for selecting participants that is based on the principles in the Merit-Based Immigration System proposal on Trump\u2019s list. The points would be subject to negotiation, and the participants could be allowed to renew their status indefinitely.\n\nThis would provide security for many, if not all, of the DACA participants while Congress works on a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would include a more permanent solution.\n\nAn incentive.\n\nRealistically, it is not going to be possible to work with Trump on a permanent DACA program without providing the funds he needs to at least start the construction of his wall, but this does not have to be a deal breaker.\n\nGet him started with funding to complete the last 47 miles of the border fencing that was mandated by the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed in the Senate 80 to 19.
