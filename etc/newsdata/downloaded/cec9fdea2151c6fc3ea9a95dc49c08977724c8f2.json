It's distracting the boys from their work.\"\n\n\"Suddenly I feel less like one of the staff and more like one of the students,\" Bokody writes.\n\nShe goes on to explain that it was her first experience of being sexualised against her will - but it certainly wasn't the last.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nTwo days after the meeting, she handed in her resignation, not because she was uncomfortable (although she was), but because she believed the young men she'd been teaching were capable of more than admiring her outfits.\n\nDespite the experience, she enjoys wearing sexy clothing but is still frequently told that if she wants to be taken seriously she needs to \"cover up\".\n\n\"The fact that I have multiple university degrees, manage a team and run my own successful company all seemingly count for nothing if my bra's visible on Instagram ,\" Bokody continues.\n\nShe goes on to call out the ideology and pop culture for reinforcing it and teaching us that \"women exist to appeal to men\".\n\n\"There's a danger to this kind of objectification,\" she adds. \"It allows us to look the other way when women are slut-shamed, harassed and assaulted.\n\n\"It gives us permission to put the burden back onto the woman when she receives unsolicited sexual attention. To tell ourselves, she must have secretly wanted it.\"\n\nDiscover more about Nadia's journey with sex and body positivity over on Instagram.", "description": "A woman has revealed how being sexualised against her will caused her to resign from her job", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Nadiabokody Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14217983.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/7_Nadia-Bokody.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
