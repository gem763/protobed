No not Paul Hollywood\n\nIn fact it wasn\u2019t just the threat of the soggy bottom but the whole of Pastry Week they struggled with \u2013 so badly you wondered why they\u2019d entered the Bake Off, or hadn\u2019t practiced for one of its traditional themes.\n\n\u2018I just don\u2019t like pastry,\u2019 Rosie said at the beginning. \u2018It\u2019s not really a pleasant thing to deal with.\u2019\n\nSteph, this year\u2019s standout candidate, agreed, revealing weirdly: \u2018I\u2019m not really a pastry cook at all\u2026Pie\u2019s never been my thing.\u2019\n\nShe proved it too, narrowly avoiding last place in the Technical Challenge and making a savoury tarte tatin in the Signature that at best she said was \u2018not horrific.\u2019\n\nIt told you how terrible the others were that she was still the clear winner - the fourth time in eight episodes so far.\n\n\u2018The only one who got it right!\u2019 Paul Hollywood declared about her Showstoppper.\n\nStruggles: It wasn\u2019t just the threat of the soggy bottom but the whole of Pastry Week they struggled with \u2013 so badly you wondered why they\u2019d entered the Bake Off\n\nSadly, last week\u2019s Star Baker, Henry, went from hero to zero and left the contest \u2013 disastrously for him, and us.\n\nLast week when Paul Hollywood \u2018honoured\u2019 him with a handshake, Henry\u2019s reaction (\u2018shut up!\u2019) had wowed the viewers, but not necessarily the man himself, who definitely got his own back later, and possibly his revenge tonight (served cold, obviously).\n\nHaving been consistently good \u2013 and funny \u2013 throughout the series, it was a shame and, arguably, unfair.\n\nSad news: Sadly, last week\u2019s Star Baker, Henry, went from hero to zero and left the contest \u2013 disastrously for him, and us\n\nBefore the Showstopper both judges said any of the others could go.\n\nAlice seemed to spend the evening suffering from a soggy bottom and even \u2018a soggy middle\u2019 while Rosie herself stated \u2018I got lucky!\u2019 when she came so close to calamity in the Technical, Noel Fielding had to give her a hug.\n\n\u2018This is my biggest fear!\u2019 she sobbed. \u2018Not being able to present something.\u2019\n\nThe spectre of a soggy bottom meant all the Bakers over compensated and ended up producing pies that weren\u2019t moist enough.\n\nFuming: Last week when Paul Hollywood \u2018honoured\u2019 him with a handshake, Henry\u2019s reaction (\u2018shut up!\u2019) had wowed the viewers, but not necessarily the man himself\n\nDavid\u2019s tarte tatin for example was \u2018bone dry\u2019, which bizarrely he almost expected, creating two dips \u2018to save it\u2019 (as Prue Leith put it) - rather than just make something else that didn\u2019t need them.\n\nHis Showstopper was equally perverse.\n\n\u2018Is there a reason why you haven\u2019t got a lid on any of your pies?\u2019 demanded Paul Hollywood. \u2018What makes a pie a pie?!\u2019\n\n\u2018Well true actually,\u2019 David admitted. \u2018It\u2019s the lid isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\nSo going into the Showstopper, it was all to play for.\n\nThey were asked to make \u2018a vertical pie supporting at least two further pies.\u2019\n\nNo one knows why, even Prue who confirmed: \u2018this is a fairly crazy idea.\u2019\n\nThe judges and the Bakers all seemed to have forgotten what the point of a pie was: eating it.\n\n\u2018It was so disappointing!\u2019 lamented Leith, about the overall standard.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t try any of them but it was a visual feast!\u2019 suggested Sandi Toksvig.\n\n\u2018Unfortunately that\u2019s where it stopped,\u2019 Prue sighed.\n\nThe favourite\u2019s \u2018carousel pie\u2019 (\u2018with delicately-painted pastry horses\u2019) was, Paul Hollywood said, \u2018very neat, very organized, very Steph!\u2019\n\nBut the rest were all a mess.\n\nNot impressed: The judges and the Bakers all seemed to have forgotten what the point of a pie was: eating it. \u2018It was so disappointing!\u2019 lamented Leith, about the overall standard\n\n\u2018I\u2019m making a tree trunk out of pastry which is going to support a tree house made of pie and hopefully a swing,\u2019 Alice informed Paul Hollywood brightly.\n\nShe did too. Unfortunately, in his opinion, she neglected to stop her pastry being \u2018as tough as old boots.\u2019\n\nRosie\u2019s \u2018Rapunzel tower\u2019 had a dragon (\u2018named Bert\u2019) and nine pies in total.\n\nAgain the judges declared it \u2018imaginative\u2019, \u2018very funny\u2019, and \u2018the sculpture excellent.\u2019\n\nEqually though, Hollywood said: \u2018the textures are all wrong.\u2019\n\n\u2018Very dry too!\u2019 chipped in Leith.\n\nUnforgivable: As for David, Hollywood never did forgive him for making \u2018open pies\u2019, especially as \u2018you\u2019ve lost all the moisture because it\u2019s got no lid. It just blew away'\n\nAs for David, Hollywood never did forgive him for making \u2018open pies\u2019, especially as \u2018you\u2019ve lost all the moisture because it\u2019s got no lid. It just blew away.\u2019\n\nDespite this, even considering the dips debacle, David survived thanks to his win in the Technical Challenge.\n\nHenry had (effectively) won the Signature but then finished last in the Technical so approaching the Showstopper he obviously feared the worst.\n\n\u2018I feel like Jesus did on Maundy Thursday - awaiting crucifixion!\u2019 he said, something of an over-exaggeration and a slight God complex but still\u2026\n\nFor reasons best known to himself, for his Showstopper he chose to make \u2018an upside down chandelier.\u2019\n\nTo compound this eccentric theme it consisted of two chicken & ham pies and two made from mixed spice, pecan, and chocolate.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re just really nice flavours,\u2019 explained Henry to the judges about the combination.\n\n\u2018Who says?!\u2019 growled Hollywood, clearly (understandably) unconvinced.\n\nNeat: The favourite\u2019s \u2018carousel pie\u2019 (\u2018with delicately-painted pastry horses\u2019) was, Paul Hollywood said, \u2018very neat, very organized, very Steph!\u2019\n\nThe suspicion that Henry was being picked on then grew when, while making his Showstopper, he also made the mistake of asking Hollywood for a little hint.\n\n\u2018Do you like meaty pies? Or can you go overboard, do you think?\u2019\n\nThe long, blank, stare Hollywood gave Henry suggested he was unamused.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the eyes!\u2019 Henry whispered to the camera. \u2018Like a shark, with even less mercy.\u2019\n\nThese exchanges certainly didn\u2019t bode well when it came to the judging, especially as Henry\u2019s creation did not resemble a chandelier \u2013 \u2018upside down\u2019 or otherwise.\n\n\u2018Just two pies stacked on top of one another!\u2019 sneered Leith.\n\n\u2018And putting dried leaves on top of the pie is never a good idea!\u2019 complained Hollywood, adding Henry\u2019s pastry was \u2018way too thick\u2019 (not ideal in Pastry Week) while the chocolate pie \u2018tastes like mince pie!\u2019\n\n\u2018Do you like Christmas?\u2019 Henry came back, in a flash. But he must have known it would be his last quip when Hollywood growled: \u2018humbug!\u2019\n\nSending him home was bad for Henry, the show, and the viewers, partly because \u2013 as \u2018shut up!\u2019 illustrated - he had such a witty, youthful, repertoire.\n\n(Talking about the Moroccan sheets of pastry, he referenced Game Of Thrones calling them \u2018white warqas.\u2019)\n\nPlus, Henry had been the only Baker who looked even vaguely capable of challenging the favourite.\n\nNow though, without Henry and with Steph being awarded Star Baker for the fourth time, it would be a miracle - or rather a joke - if she doesn\u2019t go on to become this year\u2019s champion.\n\nAnd so Pastry Week\u2019s notorious soggy bottom claimed Henry as its latest victim.\n\nIt had surely also killed off the series too.", "description": "After nine years and ten series, even the best contestants on The Great British Bake Off still had no answer to their nemesis, the show's famous, merciless, adversary.", "authors": ["Jim Shelley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19760258-0-image-a-34_1571174077915.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
