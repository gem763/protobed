For example, following all 'house rules' daily resulted in one token.\n\n'Completing chores for the week (they do two every day and another two they choose each week,' she said.\n\n'Reaching five stars in the YES chart (they do as they are asked the first time).'\n\nThe clever mum explained she'd created the system using a whiteboard from Kmart and buckets from IKEA, priced at $1.99 each.\n\nThe system encourages kids to help out as they can negotiate what kinds of rewards they'd like once they've accrued enough tokens (stock image)\n\nAs to be expected, Shelley's novel idea has struck a chord with parents everywhere with many saying how keen they'd be to implement a similar system.\n\n'Dolphin thoughts, bucket filling, positive reward system and an organised house chart - teacher?,' asked one.\n\n'Love this! I love how you put a visual to bucket-filling!'\n\nWhile another added: 'This is so thoughtful and cute! Great job, Mummy!'\n\nA few were confused about the column marked dolphin-thoughts, which Shelley explained were simply a way of encouraging her children to think positively.", "description": "A savvy Australian mum has revealed how she devised a system for getting her children to help out around the home.
