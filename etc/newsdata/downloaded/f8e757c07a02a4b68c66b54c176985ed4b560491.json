President Trump hailed it as a remarkable victory on Sunday, one that comes after a month of controversy for his decision to withdraw most U.S. forces from Syria.\n\n\u201cLast night, the United States brought the world\u2019s number one terrorist to justice,\u201d Trump said at a much-hyped scheduled address. \u201cHis body was mutilated by the blast.\u201d\n\nThe White House said that American forces were able to nevertheless positively identify the 48-year-old Baghdadi immediately using portable DNA testing equipment and visual evidence facial recognition software they brought with them, and the Special Operations force commander on the ground reported that Baghdadi was dead at 7:15 p.m. Washington, D.C. time.\n\nThe U.S. special operations mission in northwestern Syria was staged from an airbase in western Iraq, a Pentagon official told The Daily Beast. The base had for months housed U.S. troops deployed there, and had more recently become the destination for troops withdrawing from northern Syria after the Trump administration ordered a withdrawal.\n\nThe president said the successful mission was much more important than even the capture and killing of Osama Bin Laden. \u201cBin Laden was big, but this was bigger,\u201d he boasted.\n\nTrump described how special forces executed a \u201cdangerous and daring night time raid\u201d in which American military dogs chased and cornered Baghdadi in a closed tunnel where he detonated his suicide vest killing himself and three of his young children he had taken with him. Trump said he watched the entire mission, noting that \u201cit was just like a movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was whimpering, screaming, crying. He died like a coward.\u201d\n\nOthers ISIS leaders killed in covert operations included spokesman Abu al-Hassan al Muhajir who was killed in a separate raid from Baghdadi, a U.S. official told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cWe never stopped patrolling, we never stopped analyzing intel and developing targets, the official said, noting that U.S. operations were \u201cjust slowed down during the Turkey invasion.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of Baghdadi\u2019s death comes as Trump has sought to fend off scrutiny amid an impeachment inquiry over claims he withheld military aid to Ukraine in a bid to force the country to investigate his political rivals. He has also faced heavy criticism\u2014from both Republicans and Democrats\u2014for his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria, a move which sparked fears of a resurgence by ISIS and paved the way for Turkey to attack Washington\u2019s Kurdish allies.\n\nDuring his announcement, Trump went on to thank Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq along with Syrian Kurds for \u201ccertain support they were able to give us.\u201d Trump elaborated on informing Russians present in Syria. \u201cWe spoke to the Russians, we told them we were coming in. They said thank you for telling us,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t tell them why, only that \u201cyou are going to be very happy.\u201d\n\nThe White House added that other countries with military forces in the region \u201cwere notified that American forces would be moving through the area.\u201d\n\n\u201c He died like a dog. He was whimpering, screaming, crying. He died like a coward. \u201d \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump\n\nIn an apparent slight on Democrats, Trump also suggested he withheld briefings on the raid from the senior congressional Democrats on committees involved in the impeachment inquiry, arguing that they could not be trusted to keep the information confidential.\n\n\u201cWe notified some [and] others are being notified now as I speak,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWashington is a leaking machine. The only people that knew were the few people that I dealt with.\u201d\n\nTrump said he didn\u2019t inform House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ahead of time. A House intelligence committee official told the Daily Beast as the President spoke, \u201cWe have not received any notification or briefing.\u201d Adam Schiff, Trump\u2019s foil atop the House intelligence committee, did not receive any briefing on the raid in any venue, according to the official.\n\nThe path to finding Baghdadi began over the summer after the CIA received a tip about general location in a village following the arrest and interrogation of one of Baghdadi\u2019s wives and a courier, The New York Times reported.\n\nIntelligence officers used the tip to work with \u201cIraqi and Kurdish intelligence officials in Iraq and Syria to identify Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s more precise whereabouts and to put spies in place to monitor his periodic movements,\u201d the Times reported.\n\nThe president said that the operation started more than a week earlier. \u201cWe had him scoped,\u201d he said, describing how Baghdadi changed his mind. \u201cHe tends to change on a dime,\u201d he said, detailing how they had to cancel several missions before locking in on him.\n\nA U.S. military source not cleared to talk to reporters told The Daily Beast the military had prepared for the Idlib raid for approximately a week. The Army special forces unit who conducted the raid were told their quarry was Baghdadi, the source said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence outlined more details while appearing Sunday on CBS Face the Nation. He said that Thursday afternoon, he and the president had been told there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d that Baghdadi would be at his Idlib compound. He said Trump then directed commanders to give them options, which they did on Friday morning. He said by Saturday morning, they had received \u201cwe received the actionable intelligence\u201d they could act on, which they did.\n\nAround 5 p.m. Saturday in Washington eight American helicopters, primarily CH-47 Chinooks, took off from the military base near Erbil, Iraq, according to the Times.\n\n\u201cThey were greeted with a lot of fire power,\u201d Trump said of Baghdadi\u2019s entourage. \u201cMany of his people were killed. We lost nobody. Think of that. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nThe White House said the American casualties included a wounded American military dog and two United States military members who were \u201cslightly wounded but have returned to duty.\u201d\n\nTrump said the special forces left 11 children present at the time of the raid with a caretaker and captured some of the fighters who had tried to protect the terrorist leader. He said special forces spent about two hours at the site gathering evidence and then \u201clanded at a very friendly port in a friendly country.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, call the death of Baghdadi \u201ca great day for America and a great day for the world,\u201d going on to say the \u201cspecial operations forces and interagency partners flawlessly executed a Commander-in-Chief directed operation to capture or kill\u201d Baghdadi.\n\nThe president also used the press conference to express disappointment with several European nations who have so far refused to repatriate ISIS fighters captured and being held in Syria. \u201cThe U.S. tax payer isn\u2019t going to pay to look after other countries\u2019 ISIS fighters,\u201d he said, implying they might be freed from detention.\n\nTrump had hinted at the news late Saturday as Twitter erupted with reports of a heavy gun battle and sounds of helicopters in an area of Idlib known to house the headquarters of militant groups.\n\n\u201cSomething very big has just happened,\u201d Trump tweeted cryptically.\n\nAs White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley announced a \u201cmajor statement\u201d to be made by Trump early Sunday, Newsweek cited a U.S. Army source saying Baghdadi had been killed in a special operations raid in Idlib approved by Trump a week earlier.\n\nThe elusive ISIS leader\u2014wanted by U.S. coalition forces, Iran and Russia\u2014had managed to dodge capture for years and the world only caught a glimpse of him twice since he declared ISIS a global caliphate in 2014: once in a video of his sermon from Mosul in 2014, and again earlier this year in an 18-minute video to supporters in which he portrayed the group\u2019s mounting military defeats as a sign the world was waging war against Islam.\n\nBaghdadi had been reported dead several times in the past only to resurface again and his whereabouts have long been unknown, though he was generally believed not to be in Idlib, a stronghold of rival jihadi groups.\n\n\u2014 Erin Banco contributed to this story", "description": "Trump said the elusive leader of the terrorist group detonated his suicide vest once forces closed in, killing himself and three of his young children.", "authors": ["Spencer Ackerman", "Allison Quinn", "Barbie Latza Nadeau", "Senior Nat L Security Correspondent", "News Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1968,w_3500,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572177369/RTR3X9BH_tdhnwx", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
