Not a theatre theatre, a food theatre. Why? I don\u2019t really like the theatre anyway, and I don\u2019t want to eat in a theatre any more than I want a cast to pop out and do One Man, Two Guvnors in Pret.\n\nNot now, Corden. I don\u2019t want to eat in a \u201ctheatre\u201d, just as I don\u2019t want to eat in a library or a crematorium or a centre or a zone, except sometimes Masala.\n\nSadly, Arcade Food Theatre doesn\u2019t leave us much choice. They couldn\u2019t be clearer about it. This isn\u2019t a market hall or a hall market or a street food opera house. It\u2019s a theatre. Says it right there in the Google.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nPerhaps the owners feel they\u2019ve spent too much on the fit-out to give it a less-fancy title.\n\nThe idea, I assume, is that the food is the stars. The place reeks of \u201ccuration\u201d, desperate to emphasise that this is not any old jumble of stalls, but some of the finest restaurants known to London.\n\nOoh, Shoreditch Turkish favourite, Oklava. Cripes, Pastorcito tacos. Blimey, it\u2019s Pophams, the Canonbury bakery.\n\nYou can graze from this dazzling array to suit your mood and diet, and the traders can share costs.\n\nPick your concession, pay, wait to collect, eat, repeat. I have no problem with this kind of eating, and have eaten some atmospheric meals like this, especially in hot climates.\n\nAt the Arcade, the system breaks your concentration and breaks the flow of the meal. With its agency-cool fonts and designer polish, it feels expensively sterile, like the business-class lounge of a despot\u2019s spaceport.\n\nIn general, the food is hit-and-miss and almost always a rip-off, which at least brings it in line with most other West End theatres.\n\nCasa do Frango, a restaurant I liked, served piri-piri chicken swimming in chilli oil, along with a green salad in which a little green caterpillar made stately progress along a leaf. In its defence, it was probably very hungry.\n\nThe steak from Flat Iron Workshop, whose Flat Iron restaurants offer such generous good value, was served rapidly cooling and looked pitifully small against the canteen background.\n\nThe Soho pasta institution Lina Stores is in there, but they also have a restaurant 200 metres away on Greek Street.\n\nI expect the focal point for opprobrium will be T\u014cU, a spin-off from a popular Tata Eatery pop-up, which serves sandos. These are Japanese-style square sandwiches with the crusts cut off and buttressed in hype.\n\nBroadly there are two schools of thought. Sando-apologists assert that the ingredients, especially the iberico pork, and technical mastery involved in the sandwich\u2019s assembly, more than justify the cost. In their own words, T\u014cU is \u201cchallenging expectations on what can be put between two pieces of bread\u201d, which would come as news to a number of people I shared halls with in first year.\n\nSando-haters, on the other hand, argue that \u00a314 seems like a lot for a few crumbly squares of brioche, raspberry jam and a pork nugget. You be the judge.\n\nCritics shouldn\u2019t go out of their way to attack restaurants that nobody would have heard of anyway. Arcade Food Theatre is the opposite. They have made themselves unmissable, in the literal sense, by occupying a large double-height space at the bottom of the Centre Point tower. If you spend any time in the capital you will bump into it at some point.\n\nYou might be curious. Perhaps you\u2019d recognise some of the restaurant names and have a look. Before you go in, though, ask yourself who is pretending, and who is being played?\n\nWould I go back? No\n\nShould you go? No\n\nCould you take your parents?
