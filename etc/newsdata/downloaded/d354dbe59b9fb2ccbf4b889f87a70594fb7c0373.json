And when a conversation isn't real and on top of that its tough, why would any of us want to indulge in the act of small talk?\n\nPexels\n\nIf you agree with everything I have written up until now, I have bad news. Small talk with colleagues is essential in earning trust at the workplace. Once trust and rapport are established among co-workers, you will be looked upon highly, it's easier to extend a deadline and you can even secure a promotion or be chosen to lead a project.\n\nDon't Miss 3.4 K SHARES 558 SHARES 206 SHARES 290 SHARES 168 SHARES\n\nNo wonder then that office chit-chat is important. Below, you'll learn how to master the art.\n\n1. Observe first!\n\nIt's wise to observe your colleagues before heading up to them and talking about something they won't minutely be interested in. Observe them, please don't stalk. See how they begin their day when they come to work, do they drink tea or coffee because beverage choices are a great conversation starter and what they talk to people about. This one girl in my office would reach her desk in the morning and go fill water so I started meeting her there and a simple 'hi' led us to be friends!\n\n2. Plan a little.\n\nNow that you have some idea about what your colleagues like and how they are, it makes sense to plan a little before walking up to them to hold a conversation. It's important to plan in your head how much you are willing to share. Over-sharing can make you appear creepy and that's the last thing we want. Topics related to work, an interesting book or article or talking about something interesting that happened at work can be a good place to start.\n\nPexels\n\n3. Avoid the \"how are you?\"\n\nThe boring \"How are you?\" \"Good, how are you?\" needs to end. Ideally, if you don't take any of the advice given till now and choose to ask someone how they are, please, for the love of god, continue the conversation by asking what is it that makes them feel good. And take it forward from there.\n\n4. Let your curiosity drive you.\n\nIt's simple. Ask questions in order to make a memorable small-talk. Asking questions is the easiest way for the conversation to flow, so ask away. And you never know you might learn something new. Who said small talk can't be enriching? Also when you ask questions, it shows you are genuinely interested in what someone is doing which is great because we are all narcissists at the end of the day no?\n\nPexels\n\n5. Deepen the conversation.\n\nSimple questions illicit one word responses. That's why you need a mix of open ended and one word answer questions. For instance, a simple question like \"Where are you from?\" can be followed by, \"What is your home town like? How is it different from here?\"\n\n6. You have the right to remain silent (occasionally).\n\nIf you are having a bad day and don't want to talk, do yourself a favor by putting on headphone. Everyone is aware of the new avoidance etiquette at work: putting on headphone. Always being available for a chat can make you look to available and some people might even think of you as a people-pleaser if you go around making small-talk with anyone and everyone. So go silent some days and add an aura of mystery around you.\n\nPexels\n\n7. Be kind to yourself.\n\nA study published in Psychology Today concluded how people seriously underestimated how much other people enjoyed their company. By making small talk with colleagues, you are putting yourself out there as someone who cares. And the last time I checked, this was a great thing to be in a world full of people who simply don't give a damn.\n\nSmall-talk with colleagues is a great way to earn trust which will enable you to earn success at the workplace. And we hope the above strategies help you in advancing your career.
