But in countries where there are coal mines or banks financing the fossil fuel industry, it makes sense for people to go on strike, so they\u2019re voicing their distaste for what\u2019s going on to keep their economies afloat,\u201d she says over the phone from Fiji.\n\n\u201cWe all know that the problem is not being caused here in the Pacific, but we\u2019re facing the full brunt of the climate crisis,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nThe Pacific is estimated to contribute just 0.03% of global emissions despite making up 0.12% of the world\u2019s population, but is at the frontline of the climate emergency, with countries facing rising sea levels, coastal erosion, the destruction of crucial reefs, inundations and warming seas that lead to more frequent and more severe cyclones all threaten the region.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a day, especially for the polluters, they need to quickly understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Mallam of Friday\u2019s strikes. \u201cBut at the same time, in the Pacific we feel that because we\u2019re at the frontline of the impacts, it\u2019s important for us to speak up and have other nations hear what\u2019s happening.\u201d", "description": "On Friday 20 September, millions of people led by Greta Thunberg and school students from Sydney to Delhi, Melbourne to London and New York, will march for urgent action on climate change.
