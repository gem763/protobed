To those of you who wonder if you failed me: you didn\u2019t. To those of you feel like I failed you: I did and I\u2019m sorry and I hope you\u2019ll remember me in better times and better light. I love you all. I\u2019m sorry. Please help my daughter, Naia, understand that none of this is her fault. Please remind her that I loved her with every fiber of my being.\n\nNot only did the note not mention Chappelle, a quick look at Dorman\u2019s social media activity confirms there was no animosity between the two. Dorman was the transsexual Chappelle spoke fondly of in the \u201chidden extra\u201d portion of his latest Netflix special, Sticks and Stones, when he mentioned a transsexual who laughed the hardest at his trans satire.\n\nLess than a month ago, in fact, Dorman announced on Facebook that he was opening for Chappelle, a huge boost for any fledgling comedian looking for a break.\n\nIn fact, Dorman defended Chappelle\u2019s trans satire in a August 29 tweet:\n\n\u201cPunching down requires you to consider yourself superior to another group. [Chappelle] doesn\u2019t consider himself better than me in any way. He isn\u2019t punching up or punching down. He\u2019s punching lines. That\u2019s his job and he\u2019s a master of his craft,\u201d Dorman said.\n\nPunching down requires you to consider yourself superior to another group. @DaveChappelle doesn't consider himself better than me in any way. He isn't punching up or punching down. He's punching lines. That's his job and he's a master of his craft. #SticksAndStones #imthatdaphne \u2014 Daphne Dorman (@DaphneDorman) August 29, 2019\n\nDorman also brushed off the idea Chappelle\u2019s jokes would \u201ctrigger\u201d the left, so it seems outrageous to suggest Chappelle\u2019s jokes would \u201ctrigger\u201d a suicide.\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m a liberal and I thought it rocked. I\u2019m literally the Daphne he talks about meeting in the Epilogue,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nOn September 7, Dorman said of Chappelle, \u201cAs the transwoman he talks about in the epilogue, I\u2019ll tell you that he 100% supports trans people. And the LGBT community. Comedy isn\u2019t a documentary or a sermon or a Ted talk. It\u2019s comedy.\u201d\n\nThe Daily News, however, omits all of this vital context and instead implies Chappelle\u2019s \u201ctransphobic\u201d jokes pushed Dorman over the edge:\n\nDaphne Dorman, a San Francisco-based comedienne, actress and transgender activist has died by suicide, the Office of Transgender Initiatives for the City & County of San Francisco confirmed to the Daily News. Dorman was at the center of controversy recently after she was referenced by Dave Chappelle in a stand-up special that some people called transphobic. Dorman, however, \u201cwas laughing the hardest\u201d at the trans jokes in his practice set, the comedian said. \u2026 Dorman was cited by Dave Chappelle in his special \u201cSticks and Stones.\u201d The Netflix show, which premiered on Aug. 26, was slammed as offensive by many critics for the comedian\u2019s \u201cobsession with making fun of trans people.\u201d Its humor, however, was praised by some conservative outlets, such as Breitbart and The Federalist. In a \u201chidden extra\u201d of the Netflix special, Chappelle talked about becoming friends with a transgender woman who was \u201claughing the hardest\u201d at the transphobic jokes.\n\nNote how the Daily News deliberately fails to report Dorman\u2019s view of Chappelle and his satire.\n\nWhatever it was that drove poor Dorman to suicide, it was obviously not Chappelle, nor was it satire aimed at transsexuals. In reality, Dorman should at least in part be remembered as someone who could take a joke, someone who fought for free speech and artistic expression, someone who did not believe the trans community should be immune from satire.\n\nThat is all to Dorman\u2019s credit but in pursuit of a its own far-left agenda, the Daily News sullies Dorman\u2019s memory.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
