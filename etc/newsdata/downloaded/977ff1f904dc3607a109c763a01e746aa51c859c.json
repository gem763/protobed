That's what her adoptive mother had told her, and for most of her life, Rhonda didn't question it.\n\nRhonda was born in San Antonio, Texas in 1968 and was left in a children's shelter.\n\n\"I was adopted by a white family and raised in a white community,\" she said.\n\nOnly recently, in 2017, did Rhonda discover the truth about her racial heritage and manage to find her father, Philippe \u2014 who she learned had been part of an historic protest against racism in Montreal.\n\nDealing with difference\n\nRhonda said she was treated differently from the siblings in her adoptive family.\n\n\"I never understood why it was so important to keep my hair straight, to keep my sunscreen on me,\" Rhonda recalled.\n\nHer relationship with her adoptive mother's second husband was especially difficult. Rhonda says she always tried, but failed, to earn his love. After his death her adoptive mother explained why.\n\n\"She finally said, 'He could never get past your skin colour,'\" Rhonda said.\n\nRhonda in San Antonio around the time her father Philippe was in Montreal taking part in The Sir George Williams Affair, a huge anti-racism protest at what is now Concordia University. (Submitted by Rhonda Fils-Aim\u00e9)\n\nAs a young adult, Rhonda didn't reflect much on her background. That changed in 1990, when her first child was born. Rhonda says she realized it was the first time she was looking at someone who looked just like her.\n\nSuddenly, she wanted to know more about her roots, and tracked down her adoption record. The documents listed first names of birth parents along with her mother's birth date and the fact her mother was a twin.\n\nBut Rhonda was so busy with her baby son and an impending move overseas \u2014 her husband was in the military \u2014 that her search stalled for more than 25 years.\n\nDNA discoveries\n\nBy 2017, Rhonda was 49 and had three grown children \u2014 her son and twin daughters. A persuasive friend convinced her to try out a new trend: home DNA kits.\n\nRhonda with her son Trevor and twin daughters Chloe and Chelsea in the mid-1990s. (Submitted by Rhonda Fils-Aim\u00e9)\n\n\"She kept saying, 'I know that you are part black, and you need to find out where you come from,' and she actually ordered the kit,\" Rhonda said.\n\nThe results confirmed what Rhonda and her friend suspected.\n\n\"I said to my kids, 'I was right! I knew it!'\"\n\nThe DNA results also provided names of relatives, so Rhonda started looking them up on social media. First she found relatives from her birth mother's side of the family, who were all white. Her birth mother had died years earlier.\n\nA photo of Rhonda's late birth mother, Jo Nan Head. (Submitted by Rhonda Fils-Aim\u00e9)\n\nRhonda continued searching for her father by contacting people named in the DNA results. She narrowed her search to a family in Haiti \u2014 the Fils-Aim\u00e9s \u2014 after one relative remarked that she resembled them.\n\nEventually Rhonda found Philippe Fils-Aim\u00e9, who had spent time in San Antonio in the late 1960s and had met a woman who was a twin. Rhonda had a strong feeling she'd found her father but wanted a DNA test to prove it.\n\nAt this time, Philippe was living in Haiti with Yva, his wife of 20 years, and their two daughters. He was not convinced he was Rhonda's father, but he agreed to be tested.\n\nWhen the results arrived, Rhonda was overwhelmed.\n\n\"I started crying and had to sit there for awhile,\" she said. \"I would just say out loud, 'You found your dad.'\"\n\nRhonda Lux soon became known as Rhonda Fils-Aim\u00e9.\n\nPhilippe Fils-Aim\u00e9's Facebook profile photo. (Submitted by Philippe Fils-Aim\u00e9)\n\nPhilippe was surprised but says he loves having Rhonda as a daughter.\n\n\"I never would imagine that I would have a child in Texas,\" he said.\n\nRhonda's experiences growing up are less surprising to Philippe.\n\n\"If you are black, you better expect that you will deal with racism and rejection and hypocrisy,\" he said.\n\nWhen he met Rhonda's birth mother, Philippe lived with an uncle in New York State and had been exploring the U.S. Soon after, he moved to Montreal to avoid being drafted.\n\nA young activist\n\nPhilippe was working as a photo technician at a print shop in February 1969 when he decided to support students protesting at Sir George Williams \u2014 now Concordia University.\n\nStudents had complained that a professor was racist. The mishandling of that complaint led to a protest that made headlines around the world.\n\nPhilippe took part in a 13-day occupation of a computer room on the ninth floor of the Hall Building. Riot police were called in; there was a fire and dozens of arrests.\n\nThe incident began over allegations of racism levied by a group of six West Indian students against their biology lecturer. (Radio-Canada Archives)\n\nHe had no idea he had a one-year-old daughter in Texas, about to face years of her own experiences with racism.\n\nIn 2019, Concordia University marked the 50th anniversary of the Sir George Williams Affair and invited Philippe to speak on various panels. For Rhonda, it was an opportunity to visit Montreal for the first time and to learn about her father's activism.\n\nHe's \"just as passionate today as he was 50 years ago. He really wants to see society continue to grow and change,\" she said.\n\nA bigger family, deeper roots\n\nIn Montreal, Rhonda stayed with her brother \u2014 Amilcar Delacraisonni\u00e8re, Philippe's son from another relationship.\n\nRhonda Fils-Aim\u00e9 and her brother, Amilcar Delacraisonni\u00e8re, in Montreal. (Submitted by Rhonda Fils-Aim\u00e9)\n\nDespite very different upbringings, Rhonda says she and Amilcar have much in common.\n\nRhonda has since met up with many Fils-Aim\u00e9s at family gatherings in Montreal, Texas and Haiti.\n\nRhonda says she and her adult children now have a sense of heritage.\n\n\"I raised my children [saying] that I was the roots, they were the trunk, and their children will be our branches,\" said Rhonda.\n\n\"Now for all of us we get to have a deeper roots \u2014 I no longer have to be the roots.\"\n\nA September 2019 family gathering in Braunfels, Texas, where Philippe spent time with Rhonda and her son Trevor, 29 and her twin daughters, Chloe and Chelsea, 26.
