He was accused of assaulting and racially abusing a person in South Africa in August.\n\nThe court proceedings are due to start the same day that Etzebeth, a key member of the South African team, is due to play against Italy in a crucial World Cup pool game in Shizuoka.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the court will require that Etzebeth return home to take part in proceedings. A South Africa team spokesman in Japan didn\u2019t immediately reply to messages asking for clarification.\n\nEtzebeth was accused of racially abusing a person while on a night out during a vacation in the South African coastal town of Langebaan, near Cape Town. He was also accused of assault the same night. He denied both allegations and said he had witnesses who could corroborate his story.\n\nThe late-night incidents are alleged to have happened the day before South Africa\u2019s World Cup squad was announced.\n\nEtzebeth was reportedly out at a bar with friends and family members when the incidents are alleged to have taken place.\n\nEtzebeth said in a statement after the allegations surfaced that it was \u201ccompletely untrue and unfounded to claim that I physically or racially abused anyone \u2026 multiple witnesses can corroborate that.\u201d\n\nSA Rugby promised to cooperate with authorities and said it would take a hard-line approach if Etzebeth was found to be guilty. But it also backed Etzebeth after his denials, saying we \u201ctrust our people to act responsibly.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus said he met with Etzebeth and believed his story, and Etzebeth was included in the World Cup squad.\n\n\u201cI was definitely worried about it when I first heard about it,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cIf there was any truth to it that would have been a massive issue for us. But after chatting to Eben and hearing his side of the story, there is trust between a coach and player.\n\n\u201cI have to trust him to do some stuff on the field and win test matches and he must trust me to believe him when he tells me something.\u201d\n\nEtzebeth also met with the human rights commission, the HRC, before flying to Japan with the Springboks squad. The allegations are also being investigated by criminal prosecutors.\n\n\u201cAs good and law-abiding corporate citizens, SA Rugby have given our full co-operation in the Eben Etzebeth investigation and will continue to do so,\u201d SA Rugby said last month. \u201cThe case is in the hands of (prosecutors) and the HRC. We trust and believe they will investigate it thoroughly. Once their findings are known, we will adhere to whatever is decided.\u201d\n\nThe human rights commission and equality courts were set up in the wake of South Africa\u2019s apartheid past and deal with cases of racial and also other discrimination. The courts generally operate like civil courts. The unnamed person accusing Etzebeth made a complaint to the human rights commission, the commission said.\n\nThe 27-year-old Etzebeth, who is 6-foot-8 tall, has played 81 tests and is one of the most experienced players in the Springboks squad. He\u2019s played a part in both South Africa\u2019s games at the World Cup so far, starting in the loss to defending champion New Zealand and coming off the bench in a big win against Namibia on Saturday.\n\nHe was named to start the game against Italy on Friday, when South Africa effectively needs to win to stay in contention at the World Cup.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Springboks lock Eben Etzebeth could be forced to return home midway through the Rugby World Cup in Japan after the South African Human Rights Commission said it was taking him to court over a case of alleged physical and racial abuse.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": ""}
