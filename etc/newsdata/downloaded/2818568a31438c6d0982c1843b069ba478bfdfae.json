The Democratic governor\u2019s platform was almost exclusively centered on combating climate change.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere is definitely now an opening with Inslee not in the race anymore for someone to really step up and kind of be the loudest voice on climate,\u201d said Craig Auster of the League of Conservation Voters.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to see is plans that match what the science is telling us needs to happen, in terms of the pace and scale,\u201d he added.\n\nSnagging the environmental mantle could help lesser-known candidates distinguish themselves from the crowded field, especially as climate change surges as a key voting issue for Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re wanting to see what candidates are going to do day one to tackle the climate crisis and how bold they\u2019ll be on climate action,\u201d said Jenny Marienau, political campaign manager with 350.org, a group that advocates for clean energy.\n\nAlready, several environmentalists argue that Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersLuther Campbell changes his tune on Kamala Harris Sanders spokeswoman says forthcoming immigration plan shaped by DACA recipients Bernie spokeswoman previews Bernie's immigration plan MORE (I-Vt.) has filled the void left by Inslee\u2019s departure.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the plans being put out by the candidates, the one plan that I\u2019ve seen that is comprehensive, that is economywide, that meets the demands is the one put forward by Sen. Sanders,\u201d said Mitch Jones, climate and energy program director at Food & Water Action.\n\n\u201cOthers have made good points. There are other plans that have components that need to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Sanders plan is the plan that really does set the benchmark. It\u2019s aggressive, but it\u2019s what we need to do.\u201d\n\nSanders is polling near the top of the Democratic field \u2014 often neck and neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenLuther Campbell changes his tune on Kamala Harris The Hill's Morning Report - US coastline readies for Hurricane Dorian to make landfall Democrats to duke it out for top climate candidate title MORE (D-Mass.) and behind former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenPanel: Why young voters aren't backing Biden Biden not trying to 'mislead anybody' with war story The Hill's Morning Report - US coastline readies for Hurricane Dorian to make landfall MORE.\n\nAt least eight candidates have come out with climate policy plans, and their contents indicate some common themes are taking shape. Many of the proposals call for specific clean energy targets and wiping out carbon emissions, while several go after polluting industries and clamp down on pathways for the fossil fuel industry to remain viable.\n\nSome candidates also pledged their support for the Green New Deal, a resolution introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezCastro releases climate plan Ocasio-Cortez rips Pence's stay at Trump resort in Ireland: 'It's always about the con' Democrats to duke it out for top climate candidate title MORE (D-N.Y.) and Sen.

He and several of his Democratic rivals argue the industry should pay for years of covering up their knowledge of how fossil fuels impact climate change.\n\nBut environmental leaders warn that candidates will need to offer more than just an outline of their ambitious goals.\n\n\u201cInslee was good at laying out the federal mechanisms for achieving his goals as well as what he would ask of Congress,\u201d Schleeter said, adding that other candidates, including Sanders, haven\u2019t been as good as Inslee at providing those details.\n\nActivists say they will also be keeping an eye on candidates whose climate policies give them pause, such as Silicon Valley executive Andrew Yang Andrew YangKyle Kulinski: Why the media dismisses Gabbard, Yang, and Sanders Democrats to duke it out for top climate candidate title How the media can save itself, before Donald Trump destroys it MORE.\n\nYang\u2019s climate plan, unveiled in August, relies heavily on the use of nuclear power to achieve 100 percent clean energy and calls for constructing more reactors. Nuclear energy is a divisive topic in the environmental community, with many opposed to it because of the toxic waste it produces.\n\n\u201cI think Yang\u2019s approach to climate change is deeply problematic,\u201d said Jones, who favors Sanders\u2019s plan and its call to retire all nuclear reactors.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tech guy. He\u2019s searching for tech solutions in a way that\u2019s unnecessary.\"\n\nYang garnered support from 2 percent of Democratic voters in the most recent Economist/YouGov poll.\n\nCNN said it would invite candidates with at least 2 percent support in four polls approved by the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The window to qualify for the event began on June 28 and ran through Aug. 21.\n\nBiden, Warren, Sanders and Yang will participate in the CNN forum, as will Sens.

MSNBC will host a similar climate-focused forum Sept. 19 and Sept. 20.\n\nEnvironmentalists say the lengthy CNN event will be an opportunity for those with less developed climate plans to showcase their environmental bonafides.\n\nHarris and Booker have both offered up environmental justice plans but have not unveiled sweeping environmental plans like those from Sanders or Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand Kirsten GillibrandDemocrats to duke it out for top climate candidate title Gillibrand commits to raising 'at least' million to elect women candidates in 2020 Klobuchar campaign sends pizza to Gillibrand team after she drops out of race MORE (D-N.Y.), who put forth a climate change moonshot plan before she dropped out of the race.\n\n\u201cI think [Harris] has a strong record in the Senate around environmental justice and other climate issues,\u201d said Lauren Maunus, a policy and political coordinator for the Sunrise Movement, the youth climate action group that helped shape the Green New Deal.\n\nBut Harris also \u201chas a list of vague priorities on her website,\u201d Maunus argued.\n\nHarris did earn some cred with environmentalists over the summer when she introduced legislation with Ocasio-Cortez that would take the first step toward implementing the Green New Deal.\n\nBut activists want to see a comprehensive plan from Harris as well.\n\nShe also stirred controversy when she initially planned on skipping the CNN climate forum. Her campaign originally announced that despite qualifying for the event, Harris was booked to attend a fundraiser in California the same night. They later reversed course and rescheduled the fundraiser.\n\nHarris sits has placed fourth in most polls of the Democratic candidates.\n\nEnvironmentalists say they will also be eyeing Warren, who has released a number of plans that touch on climate issues but not one big climate policy. Warren has 16.5 percent of the Democratic vote according to the RealClearPolitics polling average, just behind Sanders\u2019s 17.1 percent.\n\nClimate change activists credit Warren with being the first candidate to commit to prohibiting new oil and gas leases on public lands, a move that \u201cset off a nice little trend,\u201d Schleeter said. She has also introduced smaller plans that touch on climate and energy goals, including a green manufacturing plan released in June.\n\nSome say the piecemeal approach lays out how climate change has become an issue across several sectors.\n\n\u201cWe see it as a deeply intersectional issue,\u201d Marienau said. \u201cAt the same time, there are pieces missing from [Warren\u2019s] platform. We\u2019re waiting to hear where she stands on fracking and natural gas.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile observers are keen on hearing more about comprehensive plans, they also stressed the urgency of climate change and how candidates need to highlight what they would do immediately upon taking office.\n\n\u201cI think what we also want to see is candidates saying this is a priority on day one and a priority on the first 100 days of [their] administration,\u201d said Auster.\n\n\u201cWe're looking at how candidates are prioritizing this,\u201d he added.", "description": "Ten Democratic presidential contenders will make the case for their respective climate agendas Wednesday when they compete for the title of top environmental candidate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/climate_yangbidenwarrenbookersanders_083019getty.jpg"}
