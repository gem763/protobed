Scheer has repeatedly called on Trudeau to waive full cabinet confidences around the SNC-Lavalin affair, accusing the Liberals of preventing police from looking into the matter.\n\nParty knew of some past comments\n\nHe also indicated he expects more of this type of campaign warfare as the election drags on \u2014 and that his party was already aware of some of his candidates' controversial statements.\n\n\"In many cases we went through and we saw these and we, and the candidates, have take responsibility for that.\"\n\n\"Whether or not someone in the vetting process thought that Liberals would go back and look and see what someone said as a teenager and try to make an issue out of that...,\" Scheer said when asked why the candidates in question were still approved to run for the party.\n\nThe apology acceptance plan is not a blanket policy though, and Scheer said there will be exceptions. \"Obviously it depends on other aspects, including context.\"\n\n\"My point was, in the case of the candidates we've had issues with this week, people have right away expressed regret and taken responsibility.\"\n\nScheer has been knocked off message by strategic attacks coming from the Liberal campaign, which has been taking specific aim at the candidates the Conservative leader has been appearing beside each day.\n\nOn Thursday, the Liberals published a video of Rachel Willson, the Conservative candidate from York-Centre in Toronto, espousing enthusiastic anti-abortion views.\n\nWhen Scheer campaigned with Willson at a daycare that day, he was forced to restate that a Conservative government would not reopen the abortion issue. While Willson distanced herself from her prior comments, she did not say one way or the other whether she would bring forward an abortion bill if elected.\n\nMississauga candidate was dropped provincially\n\nOn Friday, the Liberals pointed journalists to a series of news articles about the Conservative candidate for Mississauga-Streetville, Ghada Malek.\n\nReports in the National Post and Vice News detailed how she was blocked from running as a provincial candidate for the Ontario Progressive Conservatives in the 2018 election.\n\nShe was not given the green light by the PC party because of her extensive sharing of homophobic, transphobic and anti-Muslim postings on social media.\n\nScheer has twice publicly defended Malek, saying she has apologized for her comments and that he accepts her apology. She remains the candidate in that riding.\n\nAlso on Friday, Scheer accepted the apology from his Brampton North candidate, Arpan Khanna, for a homophobic social media post from 2010.\n\nDespite the controversy, Scheer visited Khanna's campaign office on Friday night, stood by him for a rally, and the pair went door knocking together.\n\nOttawa-area candidate flees questions\n\nScheer was on the defensive again on Saturday, when past comments by his star candidate in the suburban Ottawa riding of Kanata-Carlton were re-published by the Liberals.\n\nJustina McCaffrey waits to introduce Andrew Scheer at a Saturday afternoon event in the west-Ottawa suburb of Kanata. McCaffrey left the event early, declining to answer a reporter's questions. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)\n\nJustina McCaffrey, who is a high-end wedding dress designer and well-known in the world of Canadian fashion, told a journalist that it bothers her that Justin Trudeau is preoccupied by French issues and the people of Quebec.\n\nShe apologized after the post was brought to light.\n\nThe Liberals also highlighted a video that showed McCaffrey's past friendship with Faith Goldy, who is accused of promoting white supremacy and hate speech. Goldy is banned from Facebook because of the content she promotes.\n\nA Conservative party spokesperson later issued a statement on her behalf saying the video in question was from 2013, and that McCaffrey had not seen Goldy for several years. However, Goldy posted a photo of the pair together in January, 2017.\n\nMcCaffrey ran from her own campaign event on Saturday with Scheer when a reporter tried to ask her questions. Campaign staff said she had to go door knocking, rather than answer a few questions.\n\nKanata-Carleton Conservative candidate Justina McCaffrey fled from reporters' questions following a campaign rally with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer after the Liberals posted an old video with her self-described friendship with Faith Goldy \u2014 who is well-known in Ontario for her far-right political views. The candidate later put out a statement saying she has not seen Goldy in several years. 0:20\n\nScheer will spend Sunday campaigning in British Columbia, a province where the Conservatives, Liberals, NDP and Greens all want to make gains.\n\nScheer decided to address the issues en route to B.C. in the hopes of changing the channel before his day of events.", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he will stand by candidates despite controversial past comments, whether homophobic or racist, as long as the candidate apologizes and takes responsibility.", "authors": ["Katie Simpson Is A Senior Reporter In The Parliamentary Bureau Of Cbc News.
