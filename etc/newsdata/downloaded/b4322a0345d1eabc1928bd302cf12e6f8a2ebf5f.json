I have a problem that a mistake the parents made has affected the students' learning for a whole day.\n\n\"My son had done nothing wrong. He had the same uniform and shoes on as last year.\"\n\nAnother mother, who asked not to be named, said: \"A simple warning to parents that uniform issues needed to be corrected would have sufficed.\n\n\"The majority were minor issues, such as wearing suede rather than 'polishable leather', the wrong shape shoe, the same shoes worn the year prior, and in some cases, items given the go-ahead by one teacher, yet not another.\"\n\nHowever, other parents online applauded the school for enforcing the rules strongly.\n\nThe school said students were allowed to return to normal lessons once their shoes had been changed \"which, in most cases, was very quickly\".\n\nHeadteacher Geoff Staniforth said: \"Guidelines on appropriate footwear were circulated to parents during the summer term and further information, including images of appropriate footwear, was also published on the school website.\n\n\"The first term is now well under way and we hope that all students will continue to wear their new smarter uniforms with pride.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.
