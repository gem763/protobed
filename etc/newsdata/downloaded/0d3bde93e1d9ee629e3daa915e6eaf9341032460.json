(Peter Byrne/PA via AP)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the collapse of British tour company Thomas Cook (all times local):\n\n7:40 a.m.\n\nThomas Cook's German airline subsidiary, Condor, says it is still flying and is seeking a bridging loan from the German government.\n\nCondor said on its website Monday morning that its flights are going ahead as scheduled despite the parent company's insolvency.\n\nIt said in a statement that \"to prevent liquidity shortages at Condor, a state-guaranteed bridging loan has been applied for.\" It said that the German government is currently considering that application.\n\nBritain's Civil Aviation Authority said early Monday that Thomas Cook has ceased trading.\n\n___\n\n6 a.m.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the government was right not to bail out tour company Thomas Cook, arguing that travel firms should do more to ensure they don't collapse.\n\nThe 178-year-old tour operator ceased trading Monday after failing to secure 200 million pounds ($250 million) in rescue funding.\n\nJohnson said the government would help repatriate 150,000 stranded British travelers. But he said bailing out the company would have established \"a moral hazard\" because other firms might later expect the same treatment.\n\nJohnson said, \"We need to look at ways in which tour operators one way or another can protect themselves from such bankruptcies in future.\"\n\nHe added, \"One is driven to reflect on whether the directors of these companies are properly incentivized to sort such matters out.\"\n\n___\n\n2:35 a.m.\n\nBritish tour operator Thomas Cook has ceased trading and all its hundreds of thousands of bookings canceled after the firm failed to secure rescue funding.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority announced the film's collapse early Monday. More than 600,000 vacationers had booked through the company.\n\nCAA said 150,000 are British customers now abroad who will have to be repatriated.\n\nThe group's four airlines will be grounded and its 21,000 employees in 16 countries, including 9,000 in the UK, will be left unemployed.\n\nThe debt-laden company had said Friday it was seeking 200 million pounds ($250 million) to avoid going bust, was in talks with shareholders and creditors to stave off failure.", "description": "Thomas Cook's German airline subsidiary, Condor, says it is still flying and is seeking a bridging loan from the German government.
