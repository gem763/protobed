My plan is to play Antwerp and then I am done through to the Davis Cup. If the baby came early, I would miss Antwerp and then maybe play at the Paris Masters.'\n\nShe had been in the crowd during her husband's game of mixed doubles with Serena Williams\n\nIf the baby does not arrive early Sir Andy said he has planned a four-week period of rest after his appearance in Antwerp to welcome the new addition to his family.\n\nThis is not the first time Sir Andy has risked a major tournament clashing with the birth of his child.\n\nIn 2016 there was just a one week gap between the Australian Open, where Murray was defeated by Novak Djokovic, and the birth of his first child Sophia.\n\nThe news comes after a tumultuous year for Murray, who feared he may have to quit tennis for good after a hip injury.\n\nHe returned triumphantly to tennis in June at the Queen's Club Championships, six months after a successful operation where his hip joint was smoothed down and covered with a metal cap.\n\nHer appearance with an apparent baby bump on consecutive days at the tournament sparked rumors that she was expecting although it was not confirmed by the couple until now. She was seen with an outline of a baby bump as she took her seat near mother-in-law Judy wearing a floaty blue leopard-print shirt dress\n\nHis baby news comes just days after the sportsman won his first match in a Masters tournament since spring 2017 when he beat Argentinian Juan Ignacio Londero over three sets in the Rolex Shanghai Masters.\n\nHowever he then lost in the Last 32 of the tournament to Italian opponent Fabio Fognini, beaten 7-6 2-6 7-6.\n\nThe pair then broke into a heated row after the Scots sports star, who was accompanied by his mother at the tournament, accused his rival of trying to put him off during a shout by shouting over the net.\n\nHis remarkable return to the sport comes only nine months after he tearfully announced his imminent retirement due to a hip injury.\n\nSir Andy, 32, is now aiming to compete at the top level by early 2020 following career-saving hip surgery.\n\nHe is set to play the Australian Open in January that year.\n\nHe continued: 'I had two years of having lots of pain after every single match. Now I play a match, the body hurts, I have some pain in my back, the muscles are tired and things like that, but my hip is fine and I couldn't remember what that was like before.\n\nKim also wore a black-and-white stripped midi dress at the tennis tournament this summer which appeared to hug her baby bump\n\n'It has been hard but I expected it to be quite a bumpy road because it wasn't something that has been done in tennis before.\n\n'I know having done this that you will see way more athletes having this operation and coming back to compete, because there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to. There is no pain.'\n\nWhen Kim Sears was first seen in the \u00a385 Isabella Oliver a black-and-white, polka dot maternity blouse eagle-eyed fans took to social media to share their theories.\n\nThe tennis pro, 32, is currently travelling to Antwerp, Belgium, to take part in the European Open\n\nOne user wrote: 'Anyone else think there maybe the tiny patter of little Murray feet on the way?\n\n'There's been a few times I've thought Kim looked pregnant both at Wimbledon and a few weeks back at Queens. Fabulous news if they are.'\n\nAnother added: 'Kim, is that a baby bump I see?'\n\nThe couple got married in Sir Andy's home town of Dunblane, Scotland, in 2015.", "description": "The tennis pro, 32, is currently travelling to Antwerp, Belgium, to take part in the\u00a0European Open.
