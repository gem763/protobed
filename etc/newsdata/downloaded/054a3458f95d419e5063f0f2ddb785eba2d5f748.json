There\u2019s no obligation to prosecute.\n\nAnd, to me, it\u2019s a mistake for a couple reasons. If your object is to get Donald Trump out of the White House, impeachment doesn\u2019t get you there, because the chance that you will get 20 senators, 20 Republican senators, to vote to vote Donald Trump out of office seems to me so remote, it\u2019s minuscule.\n\nSo the likely outcome of this is that Donald Trump will say, see, I was acquitted in the Senate. I\u2019m vindicated. I beat these people.\n\nAnd so he will get a little victory. And then both parties will go into revolt. And so that\u2019s the way it likely looks to end up.", "description": "", "authors": ["Realclearpolitics.Com Video David_Brooks_Trump_Did_Something_Impeachable_But_Impeachment_Would_Be_A_Mistake.Html"], "top_image": ""}
