Studio.\n\nNot only were Twitter users shocked that the scene for the New York-based sitcom was filmed all the way in California, they weren't aware that the same backdrop had been used for the 1993 flick Hocus Pocus.\n\nLocation: Both scenes were actually filmed in the Warner Brothers studio lot in Burbank, California\n\nTourist attraction: Pop band Forever in my Mind pose in front of the film set in Burbank\n\nMistaken identity: Countless fans pose in front of the Cherry Hill Fountain in Central Park, mistakenly thinking it's the same one used in Friends\n\nWitching hour: In one scene in Hocus Pocus, two characters Dani, left, and Allison twirl around in front of the same fountain\n\nIn one scene in the quintessential Halloween movie, characters Allison and Dani twirl in front of a fountain.\n\nHocus Pocus is set in Salem, Massachusetts, and ironically the fountain at the Warner Bros. studio is actually supposed to evoke the building facades in Park Boulevard, Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nAfter seeing Isa's tweet, user were flabbergasted\n\n'Today lol. I've been watching it for many yrs and never noticed. I'm 54,' said one woman.\n\n'I thought the Friends fountain was in Central Park and there aren\u2019t buildings behind it. Hmmm,' said another confused user.\n\n'My mind is officially blown,' echoed a similar sentiment.\n\n'Proof that lighting changes everything,' said another.", "description": "Thousands of Friends fans flock to Central Park to take selfies in front of the fountains, not realizing the actual backdrop, left, is in Warner Bros.
