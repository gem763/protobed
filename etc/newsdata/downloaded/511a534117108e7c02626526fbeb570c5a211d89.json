(TSXV: \u201cMLR\u201d) (\u201cMelior\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces that it expects a delay of approximately 30 days in filing its audited annual financial statements, management\u2019s discussion and analysis and related officer certifications for the year ended June 30, 2019 (collectively, the \"Annual Financial Filings\"), which are required to be filed on October 28, 2019 (the \u201cFiling Deadline\u201d). Due to the recent appointment of voluntary administrators to the Company\u2019s Australian subsidiaries as detailed in its press release of September 9, 2019, the Company is unable to complete all the procedures necessary for the Company\u2019s Auditors, MNP LLP, to be able to render an audit opinion by the Filing Deadline.\n\n\n\nIn connection with the anticipated filing delay, the Company applied to the applicable Canadian securities regulators for the issuance of a management cease trade order which would restrict trading in securities of the Company by the Company\u2019s Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. This application was rejected and as such, a cease trade order is expected to be issued against the Company commencing after October 28, 2019, until such time as the Annual Financial Filings are released, currently expected before end of November 2019.\n\nThe Company confirms as of the date of this news release that there is no insolvency proceeding against it other than the appointment of administrators of its Australian subsidiaries Goondicum Resources Pty Ltd. and Melior Australia Pty Ltd., as disclosed in the Company\u2019s news release on September 9, 2019, and there is no other material information concerning the affairs of the Company that has not been generally disclosed.\n\nAbout Melior\n\nMelior\u2019s Subsidiaries are the owners and past operators of the Goondicum ilmenite and apatite mine located in Queensland, Australia. Further details on Melior and the Goondicum mine can be found at www.meliorresources.com and regulatory filings are available on SEDAR. As detailed in the press release of September 9, 2019, voluntary administrators have been appointed to the Subsidiaries in Australia pursuant to Section 436A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Australia).\n\nMelior is incorporated under the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) and has a registered office in Vancouver, British Columbia.
