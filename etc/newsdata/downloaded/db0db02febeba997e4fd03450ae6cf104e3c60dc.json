All I want to do is run for office in my home state. This created a moment of reflection,\u201d she told The Cut. \u201c \u2026 It rocked my confidence.

A New York Times article noted Gillibrand was \u201cshunned\u201d by many powerful party donors for her stance on Franken.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Al Franken was accused of sexual harassment by an anonymous woman on Monday, the latest in a string of misconduct allegations that forced the former Democratic Minnesota senator's resignation last year.In a piece published by New York magazine\u2019s The Cut, the woman, a current \u201csenior staffer at a", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y6VBeQhB8NqvwhqvS7JmSw--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/a84d80f5880eedf43c9f21d4dac2fa95", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
