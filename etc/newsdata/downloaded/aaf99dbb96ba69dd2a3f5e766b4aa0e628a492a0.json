Here\u2019s what to look out for.\n\nThe Overlook Hotel\n\n(Image: Warner)\n\nIn the opening shot, we see a car driving up a mountain pass, presumably towards the Overlook Hotel. The shot mirrors the opening of the original film, where Jack and his family are driving to the hotel for the first time, only this time the drive is taking place at night.\n\n15 seconds into the trailer, Dan Torrence enters the hotel he walks into one of the bedrooms and sees the bathroom door has been hacked open with the words \u201cREDRUM\u201d written underneath.\n\nIt\u2019s heavily implied that this scene takes place in room 237 where Jack Torrence hacked the door with an axe in the iconic \u201cHere\u2019s Johnny!\u201d scene.\n\nREDRUM\n\nIn the original film, Dan wrote the coded message on the door while continuously chanting the phrase. Wendy sees the message reflected in the bedroom mirror which reveals itself to say \u201cMURDER.\u201d\n\nLater in the trailer, we see Dan Torrence staring at a mirror and seeing the phrase \u201cREDRUM\" reflected in front of him, reversing the coding of the mysterious phrase.\n\nThe Grady Sisters\n\nAt the end of a long corridor, two sisters wearing the same dress can be seen asking Danny to play with them. They also appear in the original film and are believed to be ghosts of the Grady sisters.\n\nThe sisters were murdered by Charles Grady, their father and previous caretaker of the Overlook Hotel after developing \"Cabin Fever.\"\n\nJack was warned about what happened to the Gradys at the start of the film and Danny has several encounters with them throughout.\n\nThe Shining\n\nLater in the trailer, Dan receives a message written in chalk from another child gifted with \u201cthe shine\u201d known as Abra. Dan recognises her powers as his own and forms a bond with her.\n\nTheir relationship appears to be similar to Danny\u2019s and the head chef of the Overlook, Dick Halloran, who tells Danny about \u201cthe shining\u201d near the beginning of the original film.\n\nThe Maze\n\n2 minutes into the trailer the antagonist, known as Rose the Hat, can be seen standing in the maze of the Overlook Hotel, which is where Jack Torrence met his end after freezing to death.\n\nRose the Hat leads a cult known as \"The True Knot\" which feeds on the powers of psychic children which could mirror the chase between Danny and his father Jack at the climax of the original.\n\nThe Elevator Scene\n\nFor a short moment in the trailer, an elevator lobby can be seen overflowing with blood. This scene was also used in the original film and made famous by the film\u2019s original trailer.\n\nAt the time it was released gratuitous amounts of blood was not allowed to be shown in trailers, so Stanley Kubrick convinced censors that the blood was actually \u201crusty water\u201d to get it approved.\n\nDoctor Sleep is released in UK cinemas on October 31, 2019.\n\nAre you going to see Doctor Sleep in cinemas?
