It turned out they were scanning users\u2019 email and selling data \u2014 for example, selling data from Lyft emails to Uber. That is why you should pay money for Leave Me Alone, an email unsubscription service that doesn\u2019t sell user data.\n\nHow it works\n\nLeave Me Alone works like many email management tools: It gives you a special inbox built specifically for clearing out mail. Specifically, it presents you with emails that you can unsubscribe from: newsletters, promotions, mailing lists, search alerts, etc. This includes emails that don\u2019t have obvious unsubscribe links.\n\nInstead of an archive button, each email has a toggle next to it. Click the toggle, and Leave Me Alone tries to unsubscribe you. It does this without taking you to another webpage or making you fill out forms. It often, but not always, succeeds.\n\nThe Leave Me Alone inbox hides one-on-one emails, and it lumps all messages from one sender together. (Sometimes it\u2019s too simplistic; all my Indiegogo updates from multiple projects are lumped together, and I could only choose to quit all or none of them.) You can filter and sort senders by recipient (if you use address forwarding) and recency. You can also look at the senders that most other users unsubscribe from.\n\nYou can\u2019t open any email inside Leave Me Alone. You can\u2019t even archive it. You can only unsubscribe. The point is to focus on that one action, without distraction. To benefit from the service, you should churn through several pages of messages at once.\n\nThe Leave Me Alone inbox gives each sender a letter grade, based on other users\u2019 actions. (Screenshot: Nick Douglas)\n\nWhat it costs\n\nWhen you test out Leave Me Alone, you get five free unsubscribes. After that, you can buy credits for more, ranging from 50 unsubscribes for around $4, to 300 for $15. (If Leave Me Alone fails to unsubscribe you, you get your credit back.) Before you purchase unsubscription credits, Leave Me Alone tells you how many emails you might be able to unsubscribe some, so you can buy the right amount of unsubscribes. There\u2019s also a team plan, for $9 per month per user.\n\nIf you need to unsubscribe from 50 mailing lists, this seems like a reasonable price. More importantly, it\u2019s the only price. Unlike Unroll.me, Leave Me Alone is not also collecting your data.\n\nWhat data it collects\n\nBy using Leave Me Alone, you give the app permission to scan all your email. This is an intimate level of access, and one that Unroll.me taught many people to think more carefully about. But by our estimation, Leave Me Alone does not abuse the privilege.\n\nOn its security page, the service lists the data that it does collect and use: It collects \u201cstatistical data\u201d on which senders show up in the most inboxes, and how recipients treat it: how often a particular sender gets read, or unsubscribed, or marked as spam. Leave Me Alone says it anonymises and aggregates this data, such that no single user\u2019s habits or subscriptions could be identified. You can opt out of this data collection in the settings. And at any time you can deactivate your account, which will delete all your data and revoke the service\u2019s API access to your email.\n\nOver email, Leave Me Alone co-founder James Ivings clarified to Lifehacker that the service sells none of its user data, even anonymised. (Ivings is updating the terms of service to spell this out.) You\u2019re the customer, not the service.\n\nOur verdict\n\nThe question, then, is whether it\u2019s worth $15 to unsubscribe from a bunch of newsletters. If you find yourself spending actual time \u201cmanaging\u201d your subscriptions, or you have to go to a new unsubscribe page every day, or you have to hunt through your spam folder for lots of misplaced email, then this seems worth it.\n\nBut try it before you buy it. You might find that after a few easy unsubscriptions, you don\u2019t have much unwanted email. You might find that you\u2019re still on hundreds of mailing lists based on your online shopping, donations, political contributions, Kickstarter pledges, Kayak searches, service subscriptions, and memberships.\n\nIf there\u2019s not that much to unsubscribe from, then delete your account. But you might get hooked on that unsubscribe button, like you\u2019re zapping bugs, and saving yourself a lot of inbox clutter in the future.", "description": "A few years back, Unroll.me promised to help users unsubscribe from email newsletters en masse, for free.
