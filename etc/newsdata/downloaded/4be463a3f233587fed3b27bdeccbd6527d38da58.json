The staffer, whose boss is set to be onstage next week, said comparisons of that candidate\u2019s record against Biden\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be off the table.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s going to be the posture of a lot of candidates,\u201d the staffer added.\n\nOver the last several weeks, a number of Democratic contenders have been pressed on the trail about Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Although neither Biden has been accused by U.S. or Ukrainian authorities of any misconduct, President Trump in a July phone call asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings, a move that Republicans have labeled \u201crooting out corruption.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s Ukraine call is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry, it also touched off a wave of renewed scrutiny \u2014 and criticism \u2014 of Hunter Biden\u2019s business relationships abroad. That has left Democratic candidates to navigate the tricky position of condemning Trump for his attacks on Joe Biden while also distancing themselves from what appears to have been a potentially conflicted business arrangement.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason [to look] into Joe Biden or his son Hunter Biden,\u201d said former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke. \u201cThey have been cleared of any wrongdoing whatsoever.\u201d O\u2019Rourke clarified, however, that if he were president, \u201cI would not allow a family member, anyone in my Cabinet, to have a family member work in a position like that.\u201d Several presidential contenders followed suit.\n\nFormer Texas Rep.

Amy Klobuchar on CNN. \u201cBut that is not the issue. The issue here is what the president is doing.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris said she would \u201cprobably not\u201d let her vice president\u2019s child serve on a foreign company\u2019s board, but she criticized Trump\u2019s attacks on Biden. \u201cLook, as far as I\u2019m concerned, leave Joe Biden alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be distracted by what this president is trying to play.\u201d\n\nAppearing on CNN, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker praised Biden as a \u201cvery honorable man.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis in no way can besmirch his character, his honor and his incredible service to this country over decades,\u201d he added.\n\nSeveral campaign staffers said that unity among the Democrats on the Biden issue poses a serious threat to Trump.\n\n\u201cWe are very unified right now,\u201d said another Dem campaign aide. \u201cNo one is taking the bait. Some people might on the debate stage \u2014 CNN might try to create that moment \u2014 but teams know as soon as we do it we play into Trump\u2019s hand. We have to be focused on this. We can\u2019t lose sight of the person of the hour here: Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump himself has tweeted frustrations at the Democrats\u2019 apparent lockstep.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are lucky that they don\u2019t have any Mitt Romney types,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey may be lousy politicians, with really bad policies (Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities etc.), but they stick together!\u201d\n\nBut it will be up to Biden, who has shouldered a deluge of attacks on himself and his family, to fight back against Trump.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates are likely to stick to script if they\u2019re asked on the debate stage on Oct. 15 about rival Joe Biden, his son Hunter and the impeachment inquiry, according to sources on several campaigns.", "authors": ["Brittany Shepherd", "National Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gGu_PMd1Y.ejOvrX_H38eA--~B/aD0zMjA2O3c9NDkwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/9c62d030-ec6e-11e9-9deb-84b1fb842108", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
