And Kering is another possible suitor for the US jeweller.\n\nIn Truman Capote\u2019s novella, a trip to Tiffany could transform Holly Golightly\u2019s mood. LVMH shareholders are less easy to impress.\n\nThe French luxury group\u2019s share price hardly twitched after news of its $14.5 billion ($21.2 billion) approach to the US jewellery retailer, potentially its biggest takeover yet.\n\nThe cool response is appropriate, even if the tie-up has some merit. Acquiring Tiffany would more than double LVMH\u2019s market share in luxury jewellery to 18 per cent, the top position. A deal could benefit both. LVMH multiplied the profits of Bulgari, the high end jeweller it bought in 2011.\n\nTiffany\u2019s relatively affordable range would complement, not cannibalise the Bulgari business. Also, Tiffany is a big US employer, which might help LVMH\u2019s efforts to keep its handbags and cognac off President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff list. Tiffany, struggling to turn its fortunes around, would benefit from LVMH\u2019s global clout.\n\nLVMH paid a handsome price for Bulgari \u2014 an enterprise value-to-forward ebitda ratio of about 22 times. Its mooted $US120 a share all-cash offer for Tiffany is much less generous, at a ratio of 14 times.\n\nThe offer was a third higher than Tiffany\u2019s three-month share price average, but well below last year\u2019s high of $US139.50.", "description": "Acquiring Tiffany would more than double LVMH\u2019s market share in luxury jewellery to 18 per cent, the top position.
