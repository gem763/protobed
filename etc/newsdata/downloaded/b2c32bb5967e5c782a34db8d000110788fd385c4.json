They (the jitters) went away. As a hockey player you take that first shift, kind of take it all in. Try and not do too much and then after that get more comfortable.\n\n\u201cPlaying with two special players like that, it\u2019s incredible. I\u2019ve been watching those guys for a while growing up. To have the chance to play on a line with them is unbelievable. Obviously they had really good games today and hopefully moving forward it\u2019s the exact same.\u201d\n\nPacioretty assisted on Glass\u2019 goal, Stone had a goal and assist, and Reilly Smith added two goals for the Golden Knights, who improved their regular-season record at T-Mobile Arena to 54-22-7.\n\nSitting amongst the regular season-record crowd of 18,588 at T-Mobile Arena was Glass\u2019 father Jeff and brother Matt, making the night even more special.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been through it all with me, through the tough times and the good,\u201d Glass said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to have them here. I know they\u2019re very happy for me and I can\u2019t wait to share this moment with them. It\u2019s a special day, but I don\u2019t want to be a one-game player. I want to be an 82-game player.\u201d\n\nMarc-Andre Fleury, who was 2-1-0 with a 1.68 goals-against average and a .948 save percentage in the preseason, made 21 saves to earn the win in the 799th game of his career.\n\nFleury, now in his 16th season, improved to 10-5-0 in openers. The victory tied him with Curtis Joseph (10-2-0) and Martin Brodeur (10-5-3) for the most season-opening wins in NHL history.\n\nVegas, which will play in San Jose on Friday, improved to 6-1-2 all-time against the Sharks in the regular season. But it was San Jose that ousted Vegas in a highly controversial Game 7 during last season\u2019s first round of the playoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to get that first win at home, especially against these guys,\u201d Fleury said. \u201cOur crowd again was awesome; it was loud in there. I think our team played an awesome game from start to finish and I didn\u2019t have to do too much back there.\u201d\n\nMarcus Sorensen scored for San Jose, which played with a contingent of newcomers after forward Evander Kane was handed a three-game suspension Tuesday, and All-Star defenseman Erik Karlsson was ruled out for a personal matter just before puck drop.\n\nMartin Jones, who tied for third in the league with 36 wins last season, made 31 saves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d San Jose coach Peter DeBoer said. \u201cWe have a lot of young players that we\u2019re asking to come into this environment against a veteran, battle-hardened team with revenge on their minds. It was a big ask. The result was just and deserved. Hopefully we\u2019ll learn some lessons and get better from it.\u201d\n\nStone opened the scoring when he snapped a wrist shot past Jones on the power play. Less than two minutes later it was Smith with a one-timer from William Karlsson at the doorstep to make it 2-0. It was Karlsson\u2019s 100th career assist.\n\nSorensen cut the lead in the half later in the period when he rifled a wrist shot just over the top of Fleury\u2019s glove.\n\nGlass extended Vegas\u2019 lead to 3-1 with his goal, and Smith provided the final margin with a short-handed goal, his second of the game.\n\nNOTES: Vegas defenseman Nate Schmidt left midway through the first period and did not return with what appeared to be a knee injury. Logan Couture came in hard from the left and slammed the front of his knee into the side of Schmidt\u2019s knee, which buckled and dropped him. \u2026 One day after rookies Nicolas Hague and Nicolas Roy were assigned to the Chicago Wolves, the Golden Knights recalled both prior to Wednesday\u2019s game. Both were healthy scratches along with fellow rookie Jimmy Schuldt. \u2026 Kevin Labanc went down after taking a cross-check from Tomas Nosek in the third period and was helped to the locker room. \u2026 Sharks forward Joe Thornton is one of just two players on season-opening rosters who skated in an NHL game during the 1990s. The other is Boston\u2019s Zdeno Chara. \u2026 Sharks defenseman Brent Burns played in his 472nd consecutive game, an iron-man streak that began on Nov. 21, 2013. Burns remains two goals shy of 200.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSharks: Host Vegas on Friday night.\n\nGolden Knights: At San Jose on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Golden Knights rookie Cody Glass couldn't seem to do anything right on the day of his NHL debut.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "W.G.
