It\u2019s a group of pitchers that are arguably the best in baseball and some believe to be the finest collection of arms on one team in the majors in years.\n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019ve got the type of top-end rotation, then I certainly firmly believe in the starting pitcher setting the tone and doing all the things that a normal, traditional starting pitcher would do \u2026 I love the three at the top of our rotation, and I\u2019ll take that model every day,\u201d Houston manager AJ Hinch said.\n\nHinch and Rays manager Kevin Cash have been friends for years, and before the Astros played Tampa Bay in late August he thought about texting Cash to needle him a little about their different philosophies on starting pitchers.\n\n\u201c(What) I wanted to do in August was text him and say: \u2018I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going with an opener, but I\u2019m going with Verlander, Greinke, and Cole,\u2019\u201d Hinch said. \u201cAnd the same goes for this series.\u201d\n\nDespite their penchant for openers, the Rays will go with three true starters in the first three games of this series. Tyler Glasnow will start Game 1, 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell gets Game 2 and Charlie Morton, who got the win in their wild-card game against Oakland Wednesday night, will start Game 3.\n\nThough all three are starters, it\u2019s unclear how long Glasnow and Snell will be able to go after both missed huge chunks of the season with injuries. Glasnow sat out from May 11-Sept. 8 with a right forearm strain and pitched just 4 1/3 innings in his last start. Cash said he thinks it\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d to expect Glasnow to be able to pitch six innings on Friday.\n\nGlasnow came to the Rays in July 2018 from Pittsburgh with Austin Meadows in the big trade for Chris Archer. He said it hasn\u2019t really sunk in yet that he\u2019ll make his playoff debut opposite Verlander on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis is everything you dream about,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a little kid, you think about playing playoff baseball. Now that it\u2019s here, it\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nSnell, out from July 22-Sept. 17 after arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips in his throwing elbow, is an even bigger question after he didn\u2019t get out of the third inning in any of his three September starts.\n\nHouston\u2019s offense is certainly dangerous, but there is little question that the rotation is the star of this loaded team which won an MLB-best and franchise-record 107 games to reach the playoffs for the third straight season.\n\nVerlander and Cole are front-runners for the Cy Young after both put together dominant seasons. Verlander, who threw his third no-hitter this season, won 20 games for the second time in his career and first since winning a career-high 24 in 2011 with Detroit when he won the Cy Young and MVP. Cole set a team record by winning his last 16 decisions and topped the AL with a career-best 2.50 ERA. His career-high 326 strikeouts were the most in the majors and set a franchise record that had stood since 1979 when J.R. Richard fanned 313.\n\nGreinke, acquired from Arizona at the trade deadline, went 8-1 with a 3.02 ERA in 10 starts after the trade capped by a gem in his last start when he came two outs shy of his first no-hitter on Sept. 25 against Seattle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that their starting pitchers are dominant,\u201d Cash said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face a guy (Verlander) that\u2019s arguably the best pitcher for the last decade and a half, two decades \u2026 we\u2019ve just got to go out there and have good at-bats when any of these guys happen to make a mistake or lack an executed pitch, we\u2019ve got to be ready for it.\u201d\n\nSome things to know about the ALDS between the Rays and Astros:\n\nCORREA READY TO GO\n\nHouston shortstop Carlos Correa is healthy and will start Game 1. Correa missed the last week of the regular season because of a sore back, but has recovered and is ready to return for the postseason.\n\n\u201cI feel great right now, my back feels really good,\u201d Correa said. \u201cI had no issues at all during these three workouts.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year-old Correa played just 75 games this season after sitting out from May 26-July 26 with a broken rib. He missed a month with the back problem, which also caused him to sit out last week.\n\nCASH AND HINCH\n\nHinch was asked how the friendship between he and Cash developed.\n\n\u201cWe were just both poor-hitting backup catchers trying to survive in the game at the same time,\u201d Hinch joked before getting serious. \u201cWe have very similar beliefs and very similar backgrounds and we\u2019re trying to make this magic thing work.\u201d\n\nCash was grateful to Hinch for asking him to be on his staff when he managed the All-Star Game in 2018. And in the meeting with the team, Cash was amused by the introduction Hinch gave him.\n\n\u201c(Hinch) said: \u2018Why would we not have him here, because he\u2019s really the only guy in baseball that likes to use 11 pitchers in nine innings,\u2019\u201d Cash said.\n\nPLAYOFF EXPERIENCE\n\nSince the Rays are in the postseason for the first time since 2013, many of their players are getting their first taste of playoff baseball. That\u2019s not the case for the Astros who have only a handful of players who haven\u2019t played in the postseason. MVP candidate Alex Bregman thinks that playoff seasoning will be an advantage as Houston tries to reach the World Series for the second time in three years after losing to the Red Sox in the ALCS last season.\n\n\u201cA lot of guys have been through the postseason a few times now,\u201d Bregman said. \u201cWe know what it takes to win, and we\u2019re very motivated \u2026 we can\u2019t wait to get out there.\u201d\n\nAGELESS VERLANDER\n\nAt 36 Verlander has put together one of the finest seasons of his career and he doesn\u2019t plan on hanging things up anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI kind of pegged this like 45 number,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s realistic or not, I don\u2019t know. I know I\u2019m not going to sell myself short.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In an era when openers are in vogue and they're facing the team who started the trend, everything's coming up aces for the Houston Astros this postseason.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/alds_astros_baseball_75144_c0-203-4841-3025_s1770x1032.jpg?ca5f3d80b4de009074eb96e0dbeca7606bd5de5a"}
