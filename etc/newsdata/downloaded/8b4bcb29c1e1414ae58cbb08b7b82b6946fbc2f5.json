(iStock)\n\nColumnist\n\nIt used to be one of the most reliable money-saving tricks when renting a car: Reserve a vehicle at an off-airport location and take an Uber or taxi over. You can easily knock off 10 percent or more in airport fees.\n\nBut that loophole is closing.\n\nCar-rental customers report having to pay concession fees to U.S. airports even if they didn\u2019t use an airport rental location. The charges have been quietly imposed by municipalities in an apparent effort to boost revenue. In the process, airports are curtailing a strategy for saving a few dollars on a car rental \u2014 unless you\u2019re prepared to lie about your itinerary.\n\nConsider what happened to Art Kraus in Salt Lake City recently. When he arrived at a downtown location to pick up a rental vehicle, an Enterprise representative said he would have to declare whether he\u2019d flown into Salt Lake City. If he answered yes, he\u2019d have to pay an 11 percent fee in addition to the $322 rental charge.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\n\nKraus, a retired federal employee, says the Enterprise employee told him that the city adopted the fee policy \u201cto prevent people from avoiding airport rental fees by flying in and then renting off-airport.\u201d\n\nLaura Bryant, a spokeswoman for Enterprise, also attributes the airport charge, which has become common for off-airport locations, to local authorities who don\u2019t want customers dodging airport fees.\n\n\u201cWhen you pick up a car, you have to show your driver\u2019s license,\u201d Bryant says. \u201cIf they see an out-of-state license, they\u2019ll ask if you flew in. If you flew in, you have to pay the airport fee.\u201d\n\nEven if you didn\u2019t get there in an airport courtesy van? \u201cEven then,\u201d Bryant says.\n\nThere\u2019s no quick and easy way to find out the airports at which local authorities are trying to prevent fee dodging or how they\u2019re doing it. Salt Lake City International Airport confirmed that it assesses the airport concession fee for off-airport rental car companies that connect with their customers at the airport.\n\n\u201cThese companies will typically use a shuttle van or bus to pick up or drop off their customers at the airport\u2019s rental car center and have signed concession agreements with the Salt Lake City Department of Airports,\u201d said Nancy Volmer, an airport spokeswoman. She added that this arrangement has been standard practice in Salt Lake City for more than a decade and is codified in its concession agreement.\n\nThe Salt Lake City contract prohibits a car-rental company from intentionally diverting \u201cthrough direct or indirect means\u201d any rental car or related business with the airport\u2019s customers without including such transactions in the concession\u2019s gross revenue.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the clause in the agreement is to prevent car-rental agencies from diverting customers to off-airport locations,\u201d Volmer says, adding that car-rental companies at airports asked for the clause to protect their businesses.\n\nSimilar clauses are in place in the concession agreements for airport car rentals in Broward County, Fla.; Fresno, Calif.; Philadelphia; and San Francisco.\n\nAndy Podolsky, a retired consultant from Washington, D.C., says he saw a sign at an Avis location in San Diego warning that an airport concession fee would be collected \u201cfor customers who had flown in within 12 hours of vehicle pickup.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no mention of the potential fee when making my reservation on Avis.com or in the confirmation I received by email, and the clerk did not ask how or when I arrived in San Diego,\u201d Podolsky says.\n\nThat\u2019s a switch from the old policy, at least in San Diego. Andy Abramson, a communications consultant from Los Angeles, used to rent cars in San Diego frequently.\n\n\u201cBack then, the fees only applied to rentals near the airport where they picked up and dropped off at the airport,\u201d Abramson says. \u201cOn the other hand, car-rental company locations that didn\u2019t provide pickup and drop-off at the airport didn\u2019t charge the fee. I think the pickup and drop-off was the key determining factor.\u201d\n\nThe American Car Rental Association (ACRA), a trade association for car-rental companies, has been monitoring the spread of airport fees with concern. \u201cAirports have imposed this over our strong objections,\u201d says Sharky Laguana, an ACRA spokesman.\n\nFor instance, Orlando recently decreed that within a seven-mile radius of the airport, car-rental companies must charge a 10 percent \u201cgross receipts fee\u201d if the customer arrived at the airport within 24 hours of picking up a vehicle.\n\n\u201cFrustratingly, the money doesn\u2019t always go to the airport and is used in the municipality\u2019s general budget,\u201d Laguana adds. \u201cThe rental car companies get zero.\u201d\n\nTo avoid the fee, customers must sign a statement certifying that they did not land in Orlando within 24 hours, \u201cbut obviously we have no way to independently verify whether the customer is telling the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cBillions of dollars in airport fees are at stake,\u201d says Chris Brown, executive editor of Auto Rental News, an industry trade publication. Typically, businesses pay fees for the right to operate at an airport, but because municipalities also control taxes outside the airports, they can impose taxes on off-airport rental locations. \u201cIt makes financial sense for cities and counties to reach outside of the airport to charge an airport-use fee, although the move is likely to anger some car-rental customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt appears a loophole is closing,\u201d he says.\n\nThe only way to avoid these fees is to answer no when a car-rental agent asks you whether you used the airport recently. Kraus says he told the truth and paid $357 for his 15-day rental.\n\n\u201cThe price was still about half of the cheapest rate I saw at Salt Lake City airport,\u201d he adds.", "description": "Increasingly, airport concession fees follow travelers to off-airport car-rental locations.", "authors": ["Christopher Elliott", "Elliott Is A Consumer Advocate", "Journalist", "Co-Founder Of The Advocacy Group Travelers United.
