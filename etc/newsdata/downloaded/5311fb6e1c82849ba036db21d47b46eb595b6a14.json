He was discovered by local residents just before 9pm and was brought to hospital with serious injuries to his face and leg.\n\n\u201cThis was a horrific attack and we are liaising with our colleagues at An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.\u201d\n\nA QIH spokesman said Lunney\u2019s car and an unknown car had been found ablaze near his home shortly before 7pm last night.\n\nThe chairman of QIH, Adrian Barden, said: \u201cKevin Lunney\u2019s abduction and assault is an outrageous attack on a hardworking father of six children but also on his 830 colleagues at QIH and the wider community in the Cavan-Fermanagh region.\n\n\u201cFor several hours last evening, Kevin\u2019s wife, family and very many friends were left to contemplate the worst. Like many of his colleagues, I am frustrated and angry that more has not been done to protect Kevin, who will require some considerable time to recover from the very severe injuries sustained in this brutal attack.\n\n\u201cWe have previously warned of the inevitability of serious injury and loss of life arising from these sustained and increasingly serious criminal attacks. We find it inexplicable that not a single arrest has been made north or south despite dozens of incidents.\n\n\u201cWe are now calling for the police authorities north and south to act quickly and decisively to prevent an inevitable loss of life by bringing those responsible to justice.\u201d\n\nA Garda spokesperson said: \u201cGarda\u00ed and the PSNI are cooperating into the investigation of an incident that occurred in Fermanagh yesterday evening. A male is receiving medical treatment at a hospital in the Republic of Ireland.\u201d\n\nThe garda\u00ed believe a violent group opposed to the Quinn companies being run by new management is behind the attacks.\n\nThe companies were formerly owned by Quinn, who built up a multibillion-pound insurance business in the Celtic Tiger.\n\nOnce one of Ireland\u2019s richest men, he lost control of his company in 2014 after racking up \u20ac2bn debt in a financial gamble on Anglo Irish Bank, whose spectacular collapse precipitated Ireland\u2019s bailout by the EU and the International Monetary Fund in November 2011. Lunney worked with him in his attempts to regain control of the business.\n\nEarlier this year, QIH said two of its directors were assaulted in a shop and last October there were two suspected arson attacks on homes of executives.", "description": "Kevin Lunney runs firms formerly owned by Se\u00e1n Quinn, who racked up \u20ac2bn debt in gamble on Anglo Irish Bank", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ade5989b63408ccc12cc7dc93019bf7b4e3327d/0_185_1710_1026/master/1710.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=61e193f22e7e571dded0c9d2c3b8ce39", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
