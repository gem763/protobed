Josh Hawley (R-MO), an emerging Big Tech critic who\u2019s amplifying some of the right\u2019s favorite attacks against Silicon Valley\u2019s business elite. In a private meeting with Zuckerberg, Hawley called for Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, two of the company\u2019s roomiest lifeboats for weathering its current corporate storms.\n\nHawley, one of a handful of lawmakers who have been whipping up cries of anti-conservative censorship, tweeted on Thursday that he \u201chad a frank conversation\u201d with Zuckerberg. He appears to have explicitly asked Facebook\u2019s top executive to sell the two companies, in addition to demanding that the company conduct a third-party audit on conservative censorship to his liking. \u201cHe said no to both,\u201d Hawley added.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s trip came just a day after a lesser Facebook evangelist defended the company in a hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, this one on social media\u2019s responsibility to grapple with mass violence and extremism.\n\nFacebook and its relative peer platforms YouTube and Twitter continue to face scrutiny as lawmakers and the public come to terms with the dark side of huge, unwieldy platforms\u2014the same platforms that swelled to incredible size, glutted on their early unconditional positive regard among users.\n\nUnlike his last high-profile appearance, Zuckerberg made the rounds behind the scenes on this week\u2019s trip. On Wednesday night, he dined with a handful of senators in a gathering curated by Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA). According to Warner\u2019s office, the conversation was wide-ranging, addressing everything from election security and consumer privacy to how to \u201cencourage competition in the social media space\u201d\u2014a buffet of issues that sums up Facebook\u2019s growing headache on the Hill well.\n\nThe last time Zuckerberg visited the lion\u2019s den was last year, during the fallout over the company\u2019s back-to-back-to-back privacy scandals. Over the course of a terse testimony, the Facebook founder deflected attacks from lawmakers on the left and the right, successfully hewing close to his prepared comments and looping back through established talking points with the discipline and poise of a Big Tobacco executive.\n\nIf the threats are empty is anyone\u2019s guess. Republicans and Democrats have shown a rare sense of bipartisanship in using Facebook as a punching bag, even if their motivations couldn\u2019t be more different.\n\nHawley\u2019s call for Facebook to surrender WhatsApp and Instagram has unlikely echoes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign plan to unwind the company\u2019s two largest acquisitions\u2014a perceived existential threat for a company not accustomed to being told \u201cno.\u201d", "description": "On a quiet behind-the-scenes trip, Facebook\u2019s founder made good with his company\u2019s many, many critics in the capital.", "authors": ["Taylor Hatmaker", "Senior Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568931567/190919-hatmaker-zuckerburg-tease_vnfuau", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
