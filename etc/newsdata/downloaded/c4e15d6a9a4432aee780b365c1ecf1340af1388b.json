They also use radar absorbing paint, which has a high density but only works against a limited frequency spectrum. In one test, the new technology cut the strength of a reflected radar signal \u2013 measured in decibels \u2013 by between 10 and nearly 30dB in a frequency range from 0.3 to 40 gigahertz. A stealth technologist from Fudan University in Shanghai, who was not involved in the work, said a fighter jet or warship using the new technology could feasibly fool all military radar systems in operation today.\n\nLuo\u2019s claims and breathless comment on their implications do not constitute a major change in the way companies develop stealth warplanes or the military balance of power among operators of such aircraft.\n\nThat\u2019s because the metasurface Luo is working on is just one example of type of metamaterial that has been the subject of research all over the world. It\u2019s not terribly new. If and when it begins to appear in front-line aircraft, it could improve stealth qualities in a wide range of aircraft on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nMetamaterials have been a popular research subject for more than a decade, Financial Times reported in 2018. \u201cMetamaterials first captured the public imagination in 2006, when John Pendry of Imperial College published two papers showing how to create a Harry Potter-style invisibility cloak using the specially engineered materials.\u201d\n\nDavid Smith, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke University, who was a co-author of the research, went on to produce the first functioning cloak \u2014 although it made objects invisible to microwaves rather than to visible light. Now, the same technology is starting to be used in a number of commercial products. Because certain metamaterials can control electromagnetic waves, they can also be used to improve the performance of satellite antennas and sensors. These commercial uses may be less headline-grabbing than an invisibility shield, but they show that metamaterials are coming out of the lab and into everyday use. \u201cThese are the earliest pushes,\u201d says Tom Driscoll, chief technology officer of Echodyne, which makes radar for drones, one of the products that uses the emerging technology. \u201cIt is a time when [people are] starting to emerge from their research or stealth development phases and ship general availability products.\u201d\n\nLockheed Martin, which makes the U.S. military\u2019s F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters, is a big investor in metamaterials. In 2017 the company partnered with a Canadian firm that produces lightweight metamaterials for solar-energy applications.\n\nMetamaterials clearly are promising and, over time, could wind their way into various countries\u2019 warplane-production. But they are not revolutionary.\n\nSouth China Morning Post in a 2018 story gave voice to the skeptics. \u201cThere is debate in the research community about the value\u201d of metamaterials under development by a research team at Southeast University in Nanjing, the newspaper explained.\n\n\u201cThere is not a clear-cut definition of a metamaterial, so not everyone in the research community agrees with their claim,\u201d a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences said. \u201cThe consensus is that their product still has a lot of room for improvement.\u201d\n\nDavid Axe serves as Defense Editor of the National Interest.
