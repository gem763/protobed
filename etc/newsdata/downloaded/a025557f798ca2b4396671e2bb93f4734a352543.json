(AP) - The Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum has won a grant from Bank of America that will support conservation of the artist\u2019s pivotal painting entitled \u201cSpring.\u201d\n\nIn addition to supporting research and conservation, the funding will enable the museum to share its work online.\n\nOfficials say \u201cSpring\u201d marks a turning point in O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s life.\n\nHer husband, famed photographer Alfred Stieglitz, died in 1946 and for three years, she suspended her trips to New Mexico to stay in New York and settle his estate. \u201cSpring\u201d is one of her few creations from that period.\n\nThe conservation work will address cracks, flaking paints and darkening surface stains.\n\nThe painting also has a history of water damage caused by a leak in O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s Abiqui\u00fa home. The conservation and research into the painting\u2019s past treatments are expected to take about a year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum has won a grant from Bank of America that will support conservation of the artist's pivotal painting entitled \"Spring.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
