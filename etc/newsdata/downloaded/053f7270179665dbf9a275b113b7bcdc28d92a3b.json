Notably, the 512GB microSD card is down to $79.99, which is its most affordable price yet.\n\nAround this time last year, it was common for SanDisk\u2019s 400GB model to sell for around $100. That card is now selling for just over $50, and that may be the better value for you if you don\u2019t foresee needing a half-terabyte of storage. The 256GB model is also cheaper than we\u2019ve seen before: it costs $29.99 at Amazon.\n\nThese cards will work in more than just the Switch, obviously. Whether you use it with your console, phone, tablet, laptop, or action camera is up to you. But as prices for microSD cards continue to fall, it\u2019s a good time to buy if you\u2019re looking for a low-cost, high-capacity card.", "description": "Whether it\u2019s for your old Switch or the new Switch Lite that will be out on September 20th, you should think about getting some extra storage.
