Like beautiful monsters, they pull their past inhabitants back, often against their will.\n\n\u2018Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again,\u2019 is the famous opening line of Daphne du Maurier\u2019s creepy study in jealousy, Rebecca.\n\nWe think of Miss Havisham mouldering in the cobwebby gloom of Satis House in Dickens\u2019s Great Expectations, or Evelyn Waugh\u2019s Charles Ryder finding himself back at Brideshead, or even Count Dracula feasting on blood in Castle Dracula \u2018from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky\u2019.\n\nThe Dutch House is not only the title, but the location, and, in a curious way, also the principal character of Ann Patchett\u2019s latest novel.\n\nThe Dutch House by Ann Patchett is remincent of the Hansel and Gretel story. The central relationship is between the narrator and his sister, as the two plot against the mean stepmother\n\n\u2018I was still at a point in my life when the house was the hero of every story, our lost and beloved country,\u2019 says the narrator, Danny, who, together with his sister, has been booted out of this large, imposing mansion near Philadelphia by his grabby stepmother at the age of 15, following the sudden death of his father.\n\nHis frosty father was a property developer who, having got rich quick, bought the Dutch House, and all its contents, as a surprise for his wife, Danny\u2019s mother. At first, she thinks he has brought her into a library or a museum: it is decorated with dozens of family portraits of the previous owners, \u2018stern and unlovely\u2019. When he reveals that this is where they will be living as a family, she is horrified. \u2018He\u2019d bought the most beautiful house in Pennsylvania, and his wife was looking at him like he\u2019d shot her.\u2019\n\nThey move in. The mother bolts, leaving Danny and his elder sister Maeve in the care of the father and two servants. The father remarries. His new wife, the cold-hearted Andrea, favours her own two children over her stepchildren. The father has a heart attack and dies. Danny and Maeve find themselves banished from their own home.\n\nOver a period of years, then decades, Danny and Maeve make a habit of driving back to sit and stare at the house through the linden trees. The house becomes the focus and repository of their memories, their griefs and their sense of loss.\n\nIT'S A FACT The Hansel and Gretel story may have origins in the great famine in Europe of 1315, when starving parents abandoned their children.\n\nIn middle age, Danny reflects: \u2018There was no extra time in those days and I didn\u2019t want to spend the little of it I had sitting in front of the goddamn house, but that\u2019s where we wound up: like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we had lost was the house, not our mother, not our father. We pretended that what we had lost had been taken from us by the person who still lived inside.\u2019\n\nAnn Patchett is still probably best known for her fourth novel Bel Canto, which won the Orange Prize for fiction in 2001. It is a melodramatic tale of a diverse group of people at a party in an embassy in South America who are taken hostage by a group of terrorists. Two love stories develop: one, between a Japanese multi-millionaire and an opera singer, the other between the millionaire\u2019s translator and one of the terrorists. Other people loved it, but I struggled to believe a word of it.\n\nI read Bel Canto having enjoyed another novel by Ann Patchett, Commonwealth, which my daughter had recommended. Commonwealth has a much more down-to-earth narrative, set in middle-class America, about a chance encounter that breaks up two families, sending them to opposite sides of the country. The novel charts the impact of that chance encounter on different generations over the next five decades. It\u2019s moving and absorbing, and beautifully constructed, with none of the artificial rat-a-tat-tat box-set dramatics of Bel Canto.\n\nPatchett\u2019s books are not exactly humorous, but they have a sly comic undertow\n\nThe Dutch House gets off to such a slow start that, after 50 pages or so, I was finding it hard to keep tabs on who all the characters were, and began to wish they would get on with whatever they were going to do. I\u2019m ashamed to say that I even asked my daughter, who had already read it, if there was a murder or a kidnap to look forward to.\n\nBut then, all of a sudden, everything came into focus. The central relationship is between the narrator and his sister, as the two plot against the mean stepmother. As in Commonwealth, Ann Patchett is wonderfully astute about siblings \u2013 their power struggles and their mutual dependence, the way they so easily slip into the roles of the bossy and the bossed, the driver and the passenger.\n\nSiblings often become the curators of each other\u2019s memories, endlessly rewriting and reinterpreting versions of events that occurred long ago. As they sit staring at their old house through the window of their car, Danny\u2019s sister Maeve says \u2018I see the past as it actually was,\u2019 but Danny contradicts her: \u2018But we overlay the present on to the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we\u2019re not seeing it as the people we were, we\u2019re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.\u2019\n\nMaeve contrives a means by which Danny can extract the maximum amount of money possible from their stepmother. Though she has kicked them out of the house, with no money, their late father has set aside a trust for their education. \u2018You can be anything you want,\u2019 says Maeve, \u2018as long as it requires a great deal of schooling.\u2019 So Maeve determines that Danny enrols in an expensive medical school, regardless of whether he wants to become a doctor or not.\n\nPatchett\u2019s books are not exactly humorous, but they have a sly comic undertow. She is happy to turn received ideas on their head. Thus, though Danny completes his training as a doctor, he has always nursed an ambition to become a property developer, just like his father. His heart and soul lie in this most scorned of professions. And, once he has closed his first deal on a building, he feels liberated: \u2018I was not a doctor. I was, at last, myself.\u2019\n\nOf course, all his decisions in life have been, consciously or unconsciously, dictated both by the loss of his mother, and the loss of his home. His wife is merciless in her dissection of the instincts of Danny and his sister, scorning their urge to revisit their family home. \u2018You two park in front of the old homestead because it reminds her of her mother, you go through life like your wrists are bound together with wire because you were abandoned by your mother.\u2019 At another point, she complains: \u2018Jesus, it\u2019s like you\u2019re Hansel and Gretel. You just keep walking through the dark woods holding hands no matter how old you get. Do you ever get tired of reminiscing?\u2019\n\nHowever gothic the story \u2013 and, after its sluggish start, it grows steadily more outlandish, so that you have to fight the urge to say: \u2018But hang on \u2013 you can\u2019t expect me to believe they\u2019d behave like THAT!\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s true to say there are skeletons in the closets of most families, fuelling grudges born of feuds from long ago. As Alan Bennett once said: \u2018Every family has a secret, and the secret is that it\u2019s not like other families.\u2019\n\nIn a discreet literary reference, Patchett mentions that two of the characters share the same favourite book \u2013 Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson. This, too, is a novel about two orphans, and their lifelong struggle against their sense of abandonment.\n\n\u2018Families will not be broken,\u2019 writes Robinson. \u2018Curse and expel them, send their children wandering, drown them in floods and fires, and old women will make songs out of all these sorrows and sit in the porches and sing them on mild evenings.\u2019", "description": "The Dutch House is not only the title, but the location, and, in a curious way, also the principal character of Ann Patchett's latest novel", "authors": ["Craig Brown Event For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/13/19304000-0-image-a-7_1570276883971.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
