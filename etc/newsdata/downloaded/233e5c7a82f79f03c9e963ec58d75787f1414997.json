fraught with security concerns: report", "language": "en", "text": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 A widely downloaded Chinese propaganda app that quizzes users on Communist Party heroes and military achievements may be \u201cstudying them right back\u201d through data collection and potential security breaches, an internet freedom campaign group says.\n\nThe app \u2014 called \u201cXuexi Qiangguo\u201d or \u201cStudy to make China strong\u201d \u2014 has accumulated 130 million users since its launch by the Communist Party\u2019s propaganda arm in January, according to state media in August.\n\nMarketed as an education tool, it awards points for sharing articles and watching videos such as speeches by Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nBut the Open Technology Fund (OTF) \u2014 a US government-funded group that campaigns for internet freedom \u2014 says users also provide a plethora of data to the app, including location and emails.\n\nOTF contracted the independent German tech firm Cure53 to study the app.\n\nWhile the Communist Party advertises it as \u201ca way for citizens to prove their loyalty and study their country, the app\u2019s maintainers are studying them right back\u201d, OTF wrote on its website.\n\nThe app\u2019s terms and conditions also say users may have to hand over more personal information \u2014 such as fingerprints and ID numbers \u2014 depending on the features or third-party tools they want to access.\n\nThe Chinese government has come under increasing scrutiny for high-tech surveillance \u2014 from facial recognition-enabled security cameras to apps used by police to extract personal information from smartphones at checkpoints.\n\nAnd though \u201cStudy to make China strong\u201d is an education app, Cure53 said it contains code that could run \u201carbitrary commands\u201d \u2014 reminiscent of a backdoor \u2014 on certain phones.\n\nThe app \u201cmaintains a level of access that no app would normally have over a user\u2019s device\u201d, said OTF.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Intrusive app\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe investigation, which was conducted in August, only looked at the Android version of the app, partly because of its market dominance, said Sarah Aoun, the group\u2019s director of technology.\n\nOTF is considering tackling the iOS version \u2014 which runs on Apple iPhones \u2014 next, Aoun told AFP.\n\n\u201cThis is just another way of expanding that digital control through a very intrusive app that is being pushed onto its citizens,\u201d said Aoun.\n\nThe Communist Party\u2019s propaganda arm, which is responsible for the app, did not respond to AFP\u2019s request for comment.\n\nDozens of provincial and county governments across the country reportedly held workshops to promote the app earlier this year.\n\nChinese journalists will also have to use the app for online press accreditation exams later this month and November, said a notice last week from the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet.\n\n\u201cIt is unusual to see so much data gathered for an education app,\u201d said Jane Manchun Wong, who reverse-engineers apps for security vulnerabilities and unreleased features.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like reading a book about the great nation but the book somehow searches your home,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nThe app also scans for 960 applications \u2014 including gaming, travel and chat apps \u2014 appearing as if \u201cattempting to find which popular apps are installed on the phone\u201d, said Cure53\u2019s report.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Creepy code\u2019 \u2013\n\nA spokesperson at DingTalk, an enterprise chat platform that was used to build the app, told AFP that it had \u201cno \u2018backdoor code\u2019 or scanning issues\u201d.\n\nBut OTF said users\u2019 data and their phones could be further jeopardised if the code that \u201camounts to a backdoor\u201d runs successfully.\n\nCurrently, this code only affects phones where users have installed software that gives them \u201csuperuser\u201d privileges \u2014 such as the ability to modify the device\u2019s code.\n\nBut apps can also abuse this level of privilege to take over a user\u2019s device.\n\n\u201cThe code they found is creepy\u201d, Baptiste Robert, a French security researcher, told AFP \u2014 but cautioned against the use of the word backdoor.\n\nThe investigation also found \u201cno evidence\u201d that the code was used during testing, with Cure53 concluding that \u201cfurther investigation\u201d was needed to determine how it was used.\n\nThe code \u201ccan raise suspicion,\u201d Robert said, but to conclude that there is \u201cvast espionage from China is complicated\u201d.", "description": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 A widely downloaded Chinese propaganda app that
