Every three minutes, someone is diagnosed with a blood cancer. Depending on the severity of the diagnosis, a cellular therapy transplant\u2014which includes donated bone marrow, cord blood, or blood stem cells, also known as peripheral blood stem cells\u2014 can cure these dangerous forms of cancer. Unfortunately, 70 percent of patients do not have a fully matched donor in their family. They depend on the National Marrow Donor Program\u00ae/Be The Match\u00ae. Because current Medicare policy does not adequately reimburse cellular therapy transplants, older patients diagnosed with blood cancer face barriers to accessing lifesaving treatments.\n\nMany donors help save the lives of their loved ones by giving to a family member, but since a match from a relative is not guaranteed, it is far more common for generous strangers to step in. Because 70 percent of patients do not have a fully matched donor in their family, programs like the National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match work around the clock to expand its registry of volunteer donors and help connect patients with the people with the power to save their lives.\n\nSince being founded in 1987 with the support of Congress, NMDP/Be The Match has facilitated more than 92,000 cellular transplants to patients in need. In my home state of North Carolina, the organization facilitated 878 lifesaving transplants between 2013 and 2018 alone. During this same period, thousands of Americans heeded the call to save a stranger\u2019s life by donating bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood.\n\nYet, despite these major milestones, adult and pediatric patients across the U.S. continue to search for a matching donor.\n\nUnder current Centers for Medicare & Medicare Services (CMS) policy, Medicare does not fully cover the costs of providing cord blood, peripheral blood or marrow transplants to patients with blood cancers. Unlike solid organ transplants, like lungs and livers, Medicare does not fully cover the costs of cell acquisition, transport, transplant, and the subsequent hospital stay, which is generally 20- to 30-days. As a result, hospitals are forced to make an unthinkable choice: lose tens of thousands of dollars per transplant performed or refuse to offer cellular therapy transplants. Absent a legislative solution to this underfunding, I fear many will choose the latter option, undercutting patients\u2019 access to known cures for their cancers.\n\nWe can\u2014and must\u2014do better.\n\nThe Patient Access to Cellular Transplant (PACT) Act (S. 1268/H.R. 2498), introduced by Sens.

By adequately reimbursing hospitals for the costs of performing these lifesaving treatments, thousands of lives can be saved across the country.\n\nThanks to this bipartisan legislation, blood cancer patients can be hopeful they are a step closer to receiving the curative therapy they need.
