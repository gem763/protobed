The stock market has been booming for more than 10 years and the unemployment rate is at a low 3.5%.\n\nBut the U.S. is also the only rich country in the world where the mortality rate has been going up, not down. Much of that trend is driven by men without college degrees in America\u2019s heartland, according to Brookings.\n\n\u201cSignificant sectors of our society are dying prematurely from preventable deaths (deaths of despair) and almost 20% of prime aged males are out of the labor force,\u201d according to a recent Brookings report, \u201cGeography of Desperation in America.\u201d\n\nMortality rising in the U.S. More\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that Hispanics and blacks who started off at lower levels of life expectancy, they have continued to make progress. They\u2019re not in the deaths of despair category for the most part,\u201d Brookings Institution\u2019s senior fellow Carol Graham told Yahoo Finance, adding that \u201cThe entire trend is driven by premature mortality among less-than-college-educated whites, mainly in the middle-aged years. That\u2019s a pretty big marker that something\u2019s really wrong.\u201d\n\nGeographical distribution of deaths of despair for non-Hispanic whites More\n\n\u2018Deaths of despair\u2019\n\nDespair and lower levels of well-being have played a key role in fueling the deaths of more than 1 million Americans from suicide, or health complications from drug or alcohol abuse from 2006 to 2015, Brookings found in its report, \u201cUnderstanding the role of despair in America\u2019s opioid crisis.\u201d\n\nThe highest mortality rates are most prevalent in America\u2019s heartland, in states such as Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky, Brookings found. Those regions are precisely the places where the manufacturing and coal mining jobs that used to provide predominantly men without college degrees a lower-middle-class existence as blue-collar workers have disappeared.\n\n\u201cWe uncovered those death patterns,\u201d Graham says. \u201cWhat struck me is that poor African-Americans were three times as likely to be optimistic about the future as poor whites,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe metric that really stands out is not sort of happy, unhappy. Happy today doesn\u2019t matter a whole lot. It\u2019s hope for the future or lack thereof that\u2019s really linked with premature mortality.\u201d", "description": "The geography of despair is concentrated in America\u2019s heartland, states that voted for Trump and have been suffering from manufacturing declines.", "authors": ["Sibile Marcellus"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6GxcIDSjuyAAttrEa2WosA--~B/aD0xNDk2O3c9MTkzNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/445742f0-f4dd-11e9-bf7e-b13b8e490b2f", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
