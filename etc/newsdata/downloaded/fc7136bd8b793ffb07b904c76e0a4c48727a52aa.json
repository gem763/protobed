The S&P 500, in comparison, has edged up 0.96% for the week.\n\nThe jump in bank stocks comes as the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which is tied to everything from student debt to mortgages, staged its largest weekly climb since June 2013. The yield rose to 1.901% from 1.552% at the end of last week on optimism about U.S. economic growth and a thaw in the U.S.-China trade standoff.\n\nHigher rates tend to boost banks\u2019 net interest margins, a key measure of lending profitability.\n\nR.J. Grant, head of equity trading at KBW Inc., said he sees the movement in bank stocks as part of the recent outperformance of value stocks relative to growth stocks.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see a bunch of money piling into financials,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of folks are trying to figure out how long this rotation, this unwind, is going to continue.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo analysts this week upgraded the banking sector to overweight, suggesting investors increase their exposure to cyclical stocks like banks.\n\nShares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. were among the big gainers and set a record closing price Friday. The stock climbed 1.97% to $120.23, extending its gains for the week to 6.77%. Its previous record close was $118.77 in February 2018.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group , Morgan Stanley , Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc. also had weekly gains of at least 6%.\n\nThe bank index still lags the broader market over the past 12 months, off 4.8%, versus a rise of 3.6% for the S&P 500.", "description": "Bank stocks notched their best week since 2016, rallying alongside a big jump in government-bond yields.", "authors": ["Karen Langley"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107081/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
