(Photo: BBC)\n\nAfter he left Doctor Who in 2005, Christopher Eccleston spent years remaining silent about just why he\u2019d departed the series almost as quickly as it had returned to lauded acclaim. In recent years he\u2019s started being more open about his time on the show \u2014 but Friday at New York Comic Con he spoke plainly about why he left Who, and has yet to return.\n\nSpeaking in one of his few convention appearances since his time on Doctor Who \u2014 a messily-announced departure after just a single episode of the first season had aired, which involved the BBC forging a statement from Eccleston it had to later retract \u2014 at the Javits Centre today, Eccleston discussed a range of topics, from the traumatic struggles with mental health he recently revealed in his autobiography to his less-than-optimal time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Thor: The Dark World\u2019s villainous Malekith.\n\nBut it was about why he left the show and a character he loved playing, and why he did not return for its 50th anniversary special \u201cThe Day of the Doctor,\u201d where Eccleston was the frankest.\n\nAccording to The Independent, Eccleston alleged that his exit from Doctor Who followed a complete breakdown in his working relationship with \u201cthree individuals and the way they were running the show\u201d \u2014 presumably showrunner Russell T. Davies, and executive producers Julie Gardner and Phil Collinson:\n\nI left only because of those three individuals and the way they were running the show. I loved playing the character. I felt I was going to play the Doctor my way and I wasn\u2019t going to get involved with those politics and that wasn\u2019t workable, so off I went. I became the invisible man.\n\nEccleston went on to allege that his exit from Doctor Who lead to him being blacklisted for acting jobs in the UK, leading to the actor taking roles in the U.S. like his brief stint on Heroes. As to why he turned down Steven Moffat\u2019s offer for him to return \u2014 despite also praising Moffat\u2019s writing for his Doctor in \u201cThe Empty Child\u201d and \u201cThe Doctor Dances\u201d \u2014 alongside Matt Smith and David Tennant for \u201cThe Day of the Doctor,\u201d Eccleston stated that it was because of the narrative in the script he was given, combined with the lingering politics that led to his departure in the first place:\n\nWhen I read it, I felt that it was basically myself, Matt and Dave riffing off the fact that we used to be the Doctors. I personally didn\u2019t feel like the narrative was strong enough, particularly for the Ninth Doctor because I\u2019d taken quite a lot of abuse in my own country when I left. As the show was being celebrated I was being abused in the press and that was hard to take and very confusing. So I looked at it and I thought is this really the way I want to come back and I decided it wasn\u2019t. There were other factors, political factors.\n\nMoffat has likewise been open about the rocky path the highly anticipated 50th anniversary special took to completion, a process that saw several scripts \u2014 including one that, controversially, didn\u2019t have any incarnations of the Doctor in it at all \u2014 drafted as actors, Eccleston included, tried to decide if they\u2019d be involved or not.\n\nBut for all his frank talk of the real reasons he ultimately put the show behind him, Eccleston has made it clear that he still has a love for both his Doctor and the fans who supported his take on the war-scarred Time Lord.\n\nHis appearance at NYCC this year, and the upcoming Gallifrey One convention, are some of his first attempts to finally reach out to those fans after years of avoiding conventions related to Who, mostly thanks to the politics of his exit. As sour as his depature was, it\u2019s nice to see that there are at least some positives he can now take from his time in the TARDIS.", "description": "After he left Doctor Who in 2005, Christopher Eccleston spent years remaining silent about just why he\u2019d departed the series almost as quickly as it had returned to lauded acclaim.
