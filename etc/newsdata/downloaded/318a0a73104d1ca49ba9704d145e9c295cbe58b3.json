First, playing games with the keyboard and mouse trumps playing games with console controllers. Secondly, the gaming \"influencers\" like streamers and competitive gamers at eSports tournaments almost always play on PC.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nWhen the mainstream thinks \"gaming,\" the first thing that might come to mind are games consoles, like Microsoft's Xbox One, Sony's PlayStation 4, or Nintendo's Switch.\n\nIndeed, consoles are the ultimate in plug-and-play convenience when it comes to gaming. Literally, plug it into a power outlet, plug it into the TV, and you're playing a game \"pretty soon\"\u2014 at least, after you've downloaded the inevitable console updates and the games themselves, which can take a few hours.\n\nThe point is, consoles are easier than PCs. They're designed for gaming so that you don't have to think about what kinds of PC specs you want. You don't have to deal with the comparative complexities of Windows 10 and PC parts, like driver updates or worrying about viruses. You don't need a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and therefore a desk. Games console are just an extra subtle box for your existing TV setup in your living room. And they do a great job of playing the games that people love with impressive graphics for better value than a gaming PC, too.\n\nIt's perhaps because of the convenience and apparent domination of games consoles that countless analysts say that PC gaming is \"dead\" and will phase out of existence in the next few years. Indeed, why would anyone still play games on a computer these days?\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with two gaming PC manufacturers, Dell's Alienware and NZXT, which told us two reasons why gaming on a PC is still relevant, and more relevant than ever, even when consoles are getting better and better.", "description": "Gaming PC makers Alienware and NZXT don't think the gaming PC will die anytime soon.
