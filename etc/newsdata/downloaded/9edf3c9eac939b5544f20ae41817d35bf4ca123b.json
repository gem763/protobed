Expectations around the group are running high after the success of their debut EP and first music videos, which were released in March.\n\n\u201cBTS and Big Hit have given us very large wings and I think it is our job to soar on these wings,\u201d said Soobin, the 18-year-old leader of TXT, at a press event in Seoul Monday. \u201cOur job is to make these wings strong, and become a group that BTS can be proud of.\u201d\n\nWhile BTS has evolved to tackle social and political issues in their lyrics, TXT cuts a younger profile, with all band members still in their teens. The new album\u2019s songs focus mainly on the difficulties in transitioning to adolescence, the band said.\n\n\u201cIn adolescence, things are changing and it\u2019s hard to know how to feel,\u201d said 17-year-old Taehyun. \u201cWe have these bursts of emotions and want to share how we feel. These are stories that a lot of people can relate to.\u201d\n\nThe eight-track album features the lead single, \u201c9 and Three Quarters (Run Away),\u201d a reference to the enchanted train platform in the Harry Potter series where students board the Hogwarts Express.\n\n\u201c[The song] is about a special place where just my friends and I can go,\u201d said 19-year-old Yeonjun. \u201cThis is a place that is only permitted to us, so let\u2019s run away there.\u201d\n\nJournalist Ha Kyeong-heon, who covers K-pop for South Korean newspaper The Kyunghyang Shinmun, said that TXT still exists in the shadow of BTS for many fans, but that their own distinctive approach and narrative style is starting to emerge with this new album.\n\n\u201cI think TXT is different from BTS, which dealt with the pressure of entrance exams and schools in Korea in a realistic way, in that it presents a lot of content based on dreams and fantasies,\u201d he told UPI.\n\nThe Dream Chapter: Magic will be released at 6 p.m. Korean time (5 a.m. EST) on Monday, along with the video for lead single \u201c9 and Three Quarters (Run Away).\u201d\n\nA live TXT show will also be broadcast at 7 p.m. KST (6 a.m. EST) on Korean music channel Mnet and will stream worldwide on platforms including V Live, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nTXT made its debut in March with the EP The Dream Chapter: Star, which topped the charts in 44 regions worldwide on iTunes Top Albums and launched at No. 140 on the Billboard 200 in the United States, making it the highest-charting debut album by an all-male K-pop group.\n\nThe group sold out their first U.S. showcase tour of six cities in May and was nominated at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards for Best K-pop Act, the only newcomer in the category.\n\nThe video for \u201cCrown,\u201d the debut single from the EP, also broke the record for the most YouTube views of a debut track by a Korean male artist, with 15.1 million views in its first 24 hours.\n\nThe Dream Chapter: Magic consists of eight tracks: \u201cNew Rules,\u201d \u201c9 and Three Quarters (Run Away),\u201d \u201cRoller Coaster,\u201d \u201cPoppin\u2019 Star,\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t We Just Leave the Monster Alive?\u201d \u201cMagic Island,\u201d \u201c20cm\u201d and \u201cAngel or Devil.\u201d", "description": "SEOUL, Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 Tomorrow X Together, also known as TXT, the K-pop boy band formed earlier this year by Big Hit Entertainment, introduced", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
