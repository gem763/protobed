There\u2019s no evidence that he thinks deeply about anything. Which is why I was not shocked when he condemned the House impeachment inquiry as a \u201clynching\u201d earlier this week.\n\n\u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the president, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2014 a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nMore than 4,000 African-American men, women and children were lynched \u2014 burned, beaten, drowned, shot or hanged to death \u2014 between 1877 and 1950. Trump almost certainly doesn\u2019t know this. To a president who operates as an internet troll as much as a head of state, \u201clynching\u201d is just another provocation \u2014 another way to seize the national conversation in the face of bad news and criticism. And to a man who can\u2019t see beyond his own ego, \u201clynching\u201d must feel like an apt analogy for the scrutiny of his political opponents. He can\u2019t imagine anything worse.\n\nTrump\u2019s behavior didn\u2019t shock me. What did shock me was a comment from Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. When asked about the president\u2019s \u201clynching\u201d remark, Graham said the comparison was apt: \u201cYes, this is a lynching and in every sense this is un-American. I\u2019ve never seen a situation in my lifetime as a lawyer where someone is accused of a major misconduct and cannot confront the accuser or call witnesses on their behalf.\u201d", "description": "The president lives to celebrate his own victimhood.
