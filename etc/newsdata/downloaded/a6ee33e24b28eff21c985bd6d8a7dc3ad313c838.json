In those, he managed 43 goals or assists. Steven Gerrard played 170 and got to 47. David Beckham played in 140 and got to 65. All great players, all big names.\n\nOn Saturday, Alli appeared in his 133rd game. Amid all the VAR chaos at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, it felt like we forgot who scored Spurs' equaliser against Watford. It was Alli, stylishly putting the ball into the back of the net for the 43rd time in his career. Add those to his 29 assists, and he has been involved in 72 goals in the top flight.\n\nDele Alli shouldn't be written off... not so long ago he was one of Europe's best midfield talents\n\nAll those giving Alli stick for his form of late should bear that in mind. There seem to be a lot of short memories out there. Not so long ago, this was one of Europe's most highly-rated midfield talents, being linked with the likes of Real Madrid. He should not be written off, like some sort of one or two-season wonder.\n\nCan he do better? Of course he can. It is not too harsh to suggest that, and I'm sure Alli realises that himself, too. I named the former MK Dons midfielder in my '10 Premier League players to watch' for this newspaper back in August.\n\nI discussed how this kid is simply too good to go a season scoring just five goals in 25 games, which was what he managed in 2018-19. I called on him to become the 'hunter' rather than the 'hunted' and bring back his nasty streak.\n\nI stand by that. I felt this would be the biggest campaign of his young career. He had to silence the critics, and maybe his first goal of the season can be a launchpad for that.\n\nSometimes, given the money involved in football nowadays, we forget that these guys are human. Maybe he lost confidence. Maybe he got too comfortable. That can happen, particularly when it comes to younger players. They may be well-paid, but they aren't robots.\n\nMaybe Alli's first goal of the season against Watford can be a launchpad to an excellent season\n\nToo many have been quick to judge Alli and I hope Saturday can be the start of him showing us what he is all about. He should be walking into Tottenham's training ground on Monday morning with a swagger about him, feeling ready to get to work.\n\nGareth Southgate leaving him out of his latest England squad, for the games against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, may have given him a kick up the backside, too. When asked about his absence, Southgate said the 23-year-old's season had not got going. Well it has now.\n\nTottenham need their players to pull together. Mauricio Pochettino, as brilliant as he has been, is a manager under pressure and they need to get themselves into that top four.\n\nThey can do that with the help of Alli, so let's see if the starlet can kick on and silence those critics of his.\n\nAdam Lallana fully deserves his spot in my team of the weekend for his second-half cameo at Old Trafford. He came on and changed the game \u2014 not only with his goal but in his overall play. He made Liverpool more calm and added a new dimension to their attack. It was a reminder of how good a player he is. Maybe we had forgotten that.\n\nAdam Lallana came on and changed the game for Liverpool against Manchester United\n\nGerard Deulofeu deserved a penalty against Tottenham. So did Kevin De Bruyne against Crystal Palace. Yet neither was given or overturned by the officials sat behind the television screens at Stockley Park. As much as we like to think VAR is about getting things factually correct, there is sadly still as much opinion involved as before.\n\nJESUS IS A TRUE STAR WHO LOVES THE GAME\n\nWhat a breath of fresh air Gabriel Jesus is. I was at Selhurst Park for Manchester City's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace and he couldn't stop smiling during our pitchside interview on Sky Sports. Some players do their best to avoid talking to us \u2014 maybe it's me! \u2014 but here was a guy, genuinely happy, to talk football. No grumpiness, no sense that he was doing you a major favour.\n\nThe Brazilian was enthusiastic and eloquent. He gave off such a good impression, and you can tell how much he loves playing football. Jesus knows how hard it is to get game-time when he has a true Premier League legend ahead of him in Sergio Aguero. He took his chance at Palace, scoring his 50th goal for City and helping them secure a vital win. At only 22, Jesus has time on his side. He will not be playing second fiddle forever.\n\nMan City's Gabriel Jesus is a breath of fresh air... he won't be playing second fiddle forever\n\nSpeaking of City, how brave of Pep Guardiola to name Rodri alongside Fernandinho in defence. Guardiola did this at Barcelona, too, using Javier Mascherano at the back alongside Gerard Pique.\n\nRodri, the 6ft 3in Spaniard, was superb in that position and I'm sure this is not the last time we have seen the 23-year-old do a job in defence. It bodes well for Guardiola that he can call on the midfielder, who was signed to become Fernandinho's successor, to fill in at the back.\n\nI spoke to Jack Grealish recently and he told me he wants to take more risks. Some midfielders like to play it safe, but that is not how you get yourself goals. In front of the watching Gareth Southgate on Saturday, Grealish took a risk and scored, helping Aston Villa on their way to what could prove to be a vital 2-1 win over Brighton later in the season. Grealish is showing no fear in his game now.", "description": "JAMIE REDKNAPP: Dele Alli does not turn 24 years old for another six months, yet this kid is already ahead of the rest when you think of those who graced England's midfield before him.", "authors": ["Jamie Redknapp For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/21/19965164-0-image-a-91_1571602897196.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
