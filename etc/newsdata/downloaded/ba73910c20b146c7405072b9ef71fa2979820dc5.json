This season, the Italian league is reverting to its traditional holiday break with no games between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Napoli \"ultra\" fan has been arrested and accused of killing the Inter Milan supporter who died following clashes outside the San Siro ahead of a Serie A match last December.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
