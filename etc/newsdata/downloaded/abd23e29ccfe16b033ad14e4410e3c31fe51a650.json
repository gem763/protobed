Don\u2019t use those words,\u201d said Conway, referring her conversation with the reporter, which took place Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Examiner published a transcript on Thursday night showing Conway repeatedly telling reporter Caitlin Yilek that the White House might look into Yilek\u2019s \u201cpersonal life.\u201d\n\nConway called Yilek because she was angry about an article the reporter wrote on Tuesday that mentioned her husband, George Conway, a prominent critic of President Trump on Twitter. During the conversation, Conway accused Yilek of \u201ctrying to undercut another woman based on who she\u2019s married to.\u201d\n\nNear the end of the phone call, Conway suggested the White House might look into other people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, if you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, then we\u2019re welcome to do the same around here,\u201d Conway said. \u201cIf it has nothing to do with my job, which it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s obvious, then we\u2019re either going to expect you to cover everybody\u2019s personal life or we\u2019re going to start covering them over here.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Yilek said Conway \u201cthreatened to investigate my personal life.\u201d\n\nWhite House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway speaks to reporters at the White House on Friday. (Photo: Tom Brenner/Reuters) More\n\nAsked what was meant by suggesting the White House would also starting \u201ccovering\u201d people\u2019s personal lives, Conway on Friday said it was not a threat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a threat. I never threatened her. ... Don\u2019t use that word if it\u2019s not true. ... Do not,\u201d Conway said. \u201cIf I threaten somebody, you\u2019ll know it. If I threaten someone you\u2019ll know it ... OK? And so don\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nConway\u2019s remarks came after Trump administration allies set up an operation dedicated to researching and compiling dossiers on reporters deemed hostile to the White House.\n\nSpeaking Friday, Conway did not answer questions by multiple reporters about what she meant by bringing up the reporter\u2019s personal life.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t use the word \u2018threaten,\u2019\u201d Conway said. \u201cDon\u2019t use the word \u2018investigate,\u2019 and stop being so silly.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "On Twitter, Washington Examiner reporter Caitlin Yilek said Conway \u201cthreatened to investigate my personal life.\u201d", "authors": ["Hunter Walker", "White House Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wwzhkbxV7OJw9f0Yg_xYRQ--~B/aD0zMjU1O3c9NDg4MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/a5895800-f740-11e9-bdfa-98b4d6e93d14", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
