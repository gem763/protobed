Roberto said he believes 'Killing Tommaso Buscetta\u2019s son would be a perfect trophy,' even still for mobsters scorned by his father.\n\nDespite their best efforts to vanish entirely, eventually in 2015, a DEA agent gave Meier an old email address that he was told members of the Buscetta family had used in the past.\n\nWeeks passed without a response, until, one day, a message appeared in his inbox: \u2018I must say that your email woke up my curiosity,\u2019 the message read, later revealed to have been written by Cristina, Tommaso\u2019s third wife.\n\nShe first met the mob boss in Rio de Janeiro in 1971, a place where Buscetta would flee to in the early 1980s after serving eight years of a 10-year sentence for drug trafficking in Palermo.\n\nIn 2015, a DEA agent gave Meier an old email address that he was told members of the Buscetta family had used in the past.

Other immediate family members had been living under adopted names in a string of different states for more than three decades, never dwindling in one place for too long (pictured: The killing of Benedetto Buscetta, uncle of Mafia boss Tommaso Buscetta, December 1982)\n\nThe youngest of 17 children, Buscetta grew up in Palermo but was the only one of his siblings to enroll in the Mafia\u2019s ranks. He was hired to muscle into the black market for flour aged 16 during wartime.\n\nBuscetta quickly became an influential figure in the Cosa Nostra - or Sicilian Mafia - going above and beyond his rank as a soldier, commanding a respect unseen of someone his junior.\n\nThroughout the 1950s and into the 1960s, he was heavily involved in cigarette smuggling, apparently organizing his consignments of Camel and Pall Mall from from the Bar Commercio in central Palermo.\n\nMob bosses even sought advice from him, citing his intelligence and worldly experience, having also lived in Brazil and Brooklyn, where he worked with the Gambino crime family.\n\nQuickly, he rose his way to the top. But everything change in 1982, when two of his sons, his son-in-law, his closest brother, and a nephew, were all killed by Mafia hitmen in separate incidents.\n\nA year later, following his arrest in Brazil and wanting no part of Second Mafia War waging in Palermo, Buscetta agreed to cooperate with Italian and American law enforcement to help take down the mob.\n\n\u2018For him, breaking omerta was really the hardest decision of his life because he had this sensation that he broke something that was sacred,\u2019 Cristina, 69, says in the documentary.\n\nBuscetta quickly became an influential figure in the Cosa Nostra, or Sicilian Mafia, going above and beyond his rank as a soldier, commanding a respect unseen of someone his junior. Quickly, he rose his way to the top. But everything change in 1982, when two of his sons, his son-in-law, his closest brother, and a nephew, were all killed by Mafia hitmen in separate incidents in his home city\n\nA year later, following his arrest in Brazil (shown above) and wanting no part of Second Mafia War waging in Palermo, Buscetta agreed to cooperate with Italian and American law enforcement to help take down the mob\n\nAt around 12.30 am on July 16th, 1984, in the stifling heat of a small office in the Criminalpol headquarters in Rome, Tommaso Buscetta started to sing \u2013 but not before issuing then little-known investigator Giovanni Falcone a chilling warning.\n\n\u2018First, they'll try to kill me, then it'll be your turn. They'll keep trying until they succeed.\u2019\n\nUndeterred by the caution, Falcone continued with his line of questioning, which later secured Buscetta historic testimony in the Maxi Trial, the largest anti-mob prosecution in history, which culminated in 1987 with 473 mobsters indicted and 342 convicted.\n\n\u2018It has to be understood that during that period Buscetta was the most important, the most wanted and most endangered witness in American criminal history,\u2019 John Huber, a D.E.A. agent at the time, says in the film.\n\nBuscetta was aware that his evidence would not be enough to topple the Mafia entirely, but he knew it would strike a blow that had never previously been struck before, while also putting some of his most sworn enemies behind bars.\n\nIvan S. Fisher, who represented the Mafia boss Salvatore Catalano at the trial, said Buscetta \u2018just oozed intelligence,\u2019 and \u2018played the courtroom like fiddle.\u2019\n\nIn the meantime, Cosa Nostra inevitably fought back, first killing another three members of Buscetta\u2019s family, including two more of his sons.\n\nIn a dramatic confrontation in court with one of the mobsters he\u2019d fingered, godfather Pippo Calo, Buscetta revealed his sense of personal vendetta.\n\nThe reveal came as Buscetta grew more and more infuriated with Calo\u2019s repeated claims that he\u2019d never met his accuser.\n\n\u2018You who pretend not to know me, who brought up my own two boys, the same two that you had taken out,\u2019 Buscetta thundered.\n\nAt around 12.30 am on July 16th, 1984, in the stifling heat of a small office in the Criminalpol headquarters in Rome, Tommaso Buscetta started to sing \u2013 but not before issuing then little-known investigator Giovanni Falcone a chilling warning (Buscetta shown in September 1984)\n\n\u2018For him, breaking omerta was really the hardest decision of his life because he had this sensation that he broke something that was sacred,\u2019 Cristina, 69, says in the documentary (pictured: Buscetta, sits facing the court, but away from TV cameras, during his day-long testimony in Perugia, central Italy, September 9, 1996)\n\nCosa Nostra struck back at Buscetta's testimony. Just as he had warned, the Mafia succeed in killing Giovanni Falcone, blowing him up in a bomb attack in 1992 (shown above). Falcone\u2019s close friend and investigating partner, Paolo Borsellino, was killed two months later\n\nCosa Nostra\u2019s retributory strikes continued into the early 1990s. Just as Buscetta had warned, the Mafia succeed in killing Giovanni Falcone, blowing him up in a bomb attack in 1992.\n\nFalcone\u2019s close friend and investigating partner, Paolo Borsellino, was killed two months later.\n\nOne person the Sicilian Mafia failed to kill, however, was Buscetta himself. He died on the 2 April 2000, aged 71 \u2013 but it wouldn\u2019t be at the hands of a Mafia bullet, rather lung cancer.\n\nHe was buried under an alias in Miami, Florida. But his story and his place in history as the Mafia\u2019s first high-ranking informer, and the ravages he brought to the mob, and his own family in the process, still has resonance years later.\n\n\u2018There is still a risk,\u2019 Cristina Buscetta told the filmmakers about her decision to show her face for the first time since 1986. \u2018The Mafia does not forget.\u2019", "description": "Tommaso Buscetta broke the mafia's code of silence in the 1980s to testify in a series of historic trials that would go on to secure the convictions of nearly 400 mobsters in Italy and in the United States.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/15/20039816-0-image-a-19_1571754908129.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
