As well as changes to the plane, it has proposed changes to the ways pilots are trained.\n\nReports in the US have suggested that Boeing had hoped for FAA safety clearance next month, with airlines free to fly the aircraft later in the year.\n\nFAA approval would allow US airlines to fly the aircraft, but European operators - including Norwegian Air - would need Easa clearance before returning it to commercial service.", "description": "Europe's aviation safety watchdog will run its own tests on the plane before letting flights resume.", "authors": ["Dominic O'Connell", "Today Business Presenter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A059/production/_106994014_flight2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
