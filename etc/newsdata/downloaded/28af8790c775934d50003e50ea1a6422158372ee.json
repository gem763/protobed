Ours was a complex relationship; because of earlier life traumas and later mental illness, she came across as a coldhearted perfectionist who was always right. Asking for help or making a mistake was akin to failure. She was also rather closed-minded from a diversity perspective.\n\nHer death has resulted in many mixed feelings on my part. As never before, not even when my father died while I was a child, this experience has allowed for conversations within my own family, including our many imperfections, faith, love and death.\n\nThe unexpected part is that I continue to have waves of tears at unpredictable times, even while exercising. (The shower seems to be a constant one, however.)\n\nI suppose this represents some sort of mourning for what may have been, and at some point, it will become less unpredictable \u2014 but, really, is this normal? Sometimes it just hurts so much. It almost feels disingenuous to feel sad about what I missed.\n\n\u2014 Crocodile Tears?\n\nCrocodile Tears?: No, you are not doing grief wrong.\n\nThe heart of everything we cry about is \u201cwhat may have been.\u201d\n\nWhat you\u2019re feeling is okay, being caught off-guard by the size of those feelings is okay, the unpredictability of their surges is okay, the predictability of crying in the shower is okay.\n\nAnd crying while exercising? Physical activity can loosen up our feelings, so that\u2019s more of an \u201cespecially while\u201d than an \u201ceven while.\u201d\n\nThis is just my surface take, but the emotional environment you describe \u2014 an abundance of human frailty plus a scarcity of patience for it \u2014 can have a powerful suppressing effect. Its message being: Don\u2019t think too much, don\u2019t show too much, don\u2019t share too much. Having that ethos drilled into you could explain why you\u2019re so skeptical now of your own grief. That if it\u2019s messy, it must be wrong.\n\nThe suppression effect could also explain why, when the perfectionist pressure came off suddenly with your mother\u2019s death, you were able to open up with your family as never before.\n\nIt\u2019s also normal, and common, for surviving children to grieve both the parent they had and the parent they wish they\u2019d had.\n\nSo your big, erratic feelings sound like a necessary and healthy reckoning.\n\nGrief support tends to be a more accessible kind of therapy \u2014 ask a local hospice provider for suggestions \u2014 so if you still feel this surge of feelings and questions, then please don\u2019t hesitate to get more in-depth help.\n\nDear Carolyn: I'm in my late 60s, fiancee early 70s, first marriage for both. My niece wants her girls, now 2 and 4, to be flower girls. I feel this is just embarrassing for a 68-year-old first-time bride. I'm not 25 and don't think the wedding should be like one for a young couple. How do I get her to back down?\n\n\u2014 Bride\n\nBride: You say, \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d and then, if she\u2019s still pushing this on you, you say, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\n\nThe things people will apply pressure for will never cease to amaze me.\n\nWhile I\u2019m here, though: A 68-year-old first-time bride gets whatever wedding she and her intended want. Please make embarrassment the thing you refuse to include.", "description": "The complexity of her relationship with her mother makes her question the manner of her mourning.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "October At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
