The men had key roles in Giuliani\u2019s efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption investigation against Biden and his son, Hunter .\n\nThe indictments mark the first criminal charges related to the Ukraine controversy. While they do not suggest wrongdoing by the president, they are likely to add fuel to the House impeachment inquiry, raising additional questions about whether those close to Trump and Giuliani sought to use their influence to affect U.S. foreign policy decisions.\n\nTrump has dismissed the impeachment inquiry as baseless and politically motivated.\n\nRecords show that Parnas and Fruman used wire transfers from a corporate entity they controlled to make the $325,000 donation to the America First Action committee in 2018. But wire transfer records that became public through a lawsuit show that the corporate entity reported as making the transaction was not the true source of the money.\n\nProsecutors also allege that Parnas urged a U.S. congressman to seek the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, at the behest of Ukrainian government officials. That happened about the same time that Parnas and Fruman committed to raising more than $20,000 for the politician.\n\nThe congressman wasn\u2019t identified by name in court papers, but the donations to \u201cCongressman 1\u201d in the indictment match campaign finance reports for former Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who lost his re-election bid in November 2018. In May 2018, Parnas posted a photo of himself and his business partner Correia with Sessions in his Capitol Hill office, with the caption \u201cHard at work !!\u201d\n\nJohn Dowd, an attorney for the men, hung up on an Associated Press reporter calling about the case. Giuliani said he couldn\u2019t comment on the case and that he didn\u2019t represent them in campaign finance matters.\n\nThe men, who were arrested at Dulles International Airport and booked at a local jail in Alexandria, Virginia, late Wednesday night, were expected to appear in federal court. Two other men, David Correia, a U.S. businessman, and Andrew Kukushkin, a Ukrainian-born U.S. citizen, were also charged in the case.\n\nThe indictment says Parnas and Fruman \u201csought to advance their personal financial interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working\u201d and took steps to conceal it from third parties, including creditors. They created a limited liability corporation, Global Energy Producers, and \u201cintentionally caused certain large contributions to be reported in the name of GEP instead of in their own names,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nProsecutors charge that the two men falsely claimed the contributions came from GEP, which was described as a liquefied natural gas business. At that point, the company had no income or significant assets, according to the indictment.\n\nProsecutors allege that Parnas and Fruman conspired to make illegal contributions in an effort to skirt the limit on federal campaign contributions. The men are also accused of making contributions to candidates for state and federal office, joint fundraising committees and independent expenditure committees in the names of other people.\n\nThe political donations were made \u201cfor the purpose of gaining influence with politicians, so as to advance their own personal financial interests and the political interests of Ukrainian government officials, including at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working,\u201d the indictment charges.\n\nThe commitment to raise more than $20,000 for the congressman was made in May and June 2018. The lawmaker had also received about $3 million in independent expenditures from a super political action committee that Parnas and Fruman had been funding. A super PAC can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money in support of a candidate but isn\u2019t allowed to directly coordinate with the official campaign.\n\nThe indictment also charges that Kukushkin conspired with the three other defendants to make political contributions, funded by a foreign national, to politicians seeking state and federal office \u201cto gain influence with candidates as to policies that would benefit a future business venture.\u201d\n\nAn unnamed foreigner wired $500,000 from a bank account overseas through New York to the defendants for political contributions to two political candidates for state office in Nevada, the indictment alleges. Foreigners are not permitted to contribute to U.S. elections.\n\nThe indictment accuses the four men of also participating in a scheme to acquire retail marijuana licenses through donations to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada and other states. In September of last year, the indictment says, Correia drafted a table of political contributions and donations that was subsequently circulated to the defendants and an unidentified foreign national.\n\nThe big PAC donation in May 2018 was part of a flurry of political spending tied to Parnas and Fruman, with at least $478,000 in donations flowing to GOP campaigns and PACs in little more than two months.\n\nThe money enabled the relatively unknown entrepreneurs to quickly gain access to the highest levels of the Republican Party, including face-to-face meetings with Trump at the White House and Mar-a-Lago in Florida.\n\nAmerica First Action said the $325,000 contribution would remain in a separate account while the court cases play out. A spokeswoman, Kelly Sadler, said the committee will \u201cscrupulously comply with the law.\u201d\n\nThe AP reported last week that Parnas and Fruman helped arrange a January meeting in New York between Ukraine\u2019s former top prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko, and Giuliani, as well as other meetings with top government officials.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption investigation were echoed by Trump in his July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. That conversation is now at the heart of the impeachment inquiry .\n\nHouse Democrats subpoenaed Parnas and Fruman on Thursday for documents they have so far refused to produce to three House committees. The panels have also subpoenaed Giuliani.\n\nA whistleblower complaint by an unnamed intelligence official makes reference to \u201cassociates\u201d of Giuliani in Ukraine who were attempting to make contact with Zelenskiy\u2019s team, though it\u2019s not clear that refers to Parnas and Fruman. That could put the two men squarely in the middle of the investigation into Giuliani\u2019s activities.\n\n___\n\nNeumeister reported from New York City.
