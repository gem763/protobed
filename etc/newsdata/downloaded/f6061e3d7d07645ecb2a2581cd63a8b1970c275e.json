Each child's share would be used for such child's care, education, comfort, and support until the child reaches age 30, at which time the child would take control. If a child dies before age 30, his/her share would pass to his/her issue if any, otherwise to the other children's shares.\n\nI told the client he needed to name a \"wipe-out beneficiary\" in case all his children were to die without issue while there is still money in this trust--a most unlikely event but one which nevertheless must be covered in the trust. The client said in that case the trust should pass to his \"heirs-at-law.\"", "description": "Why do back flips to qualify for a life expectancy payout that may soon cease to exist?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/bltee74bec5f9f34f60/5cb4f516c6bfc2312293adc2/ContentPackage_Portfolio_Portfolio_1x1.jpg"}
