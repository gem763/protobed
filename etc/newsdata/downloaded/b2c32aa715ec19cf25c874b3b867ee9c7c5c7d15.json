Last quarter, Viacom VIA, +0.00% logged its first growth in U.S. advertising revenue in five years. Its film studio, Paramount, which was losing hundreds of millions of dollars when Bakish took over, is expected to turn a profit this fiscal year.\n\nAnother is that Bakish has found some answers to television\u2019s existential challenge: how to follow viewers, wherever they choose to watch. Viacom\u2019s two-year-old cluster of businesses called Advanced Marketing Solutions, or AMS, can run TV-like ads against content that might otherwise escape them \u2014 including on set-top boxes and social media, and at Netflix NFLX, +1.83% alternatives that don\u2019t charge subscription fees. One of the largest is Viacom\u2019s Pluto TV, which had 18 million viewers as of the end of July, and probably has added millions since then.\n\nBarron\u2019s recently spoke with Bakish at Viacom\u2019s Times Square headquarters in New York. Here are some highlights:\n\nOn combining CBS and Viacom:\n\nThe assets are highly complementary. Viacom has a younger audience, and CBS [CBS] has an older audience. CBS is U.S.-centric, and Viacom is more international. Combined, the companies are No. 1 in every U.S. audience demographic. That\u2019s a tremendously strong position to distributors and to advertisers. Combine that with Viacom\u2019s widely understood leadership in Advanced Marketing Solutions. And we can accelerate direct-to-consumer products.\n\nWe\u2019ve publicly stated that there\u2019s a $500 million synergy number. To be clear, that\u2019s cost savings that we have a clear line of sight on. It\u2019s reasonable to assume there\u2019s additional potential on costs. Revenue synergies account for zero of that $500 million, yet there are substantial opportunities. In fact, that\u2019s the reason you really do the deal.\n\nOn stock buybacks:\n\nThe combined company produces very substantial cash flow. The first and best use is to invest in our business, including content. We\u2019ll continue to pay a modest dividend. We\u2019re not going to radically ramp it up\u2014we\u2019re not trying to run a utility. The third use of cash, potentially, is M&A. We\u2019ll look. Fourth, delevering. But both companies are investment grade today, and rating agencies like us better together than apart. That leaves excess cash flow. It allows us to be opportunistic in the market should we want to buy back stock.\n\nOn the stock:\n\nI think people don\u2019t truly appreciate the formidable combination of assets that this deal creates. I think they underestimate our ability to execute. But the thing they\u2019re really missing is how this deal creates a company for today and tomorrow. For savvy investors, this is an opportunity to buy an extremely high-quality asset at an extremely low multiple.\n\nRead the entire interview on Barron\u2019s.", "description": "\u2019I think people don\u2019t truly appreciate the formidable combination of assets that this deal creates,\u2019 Bakish says of the company\u2019s stock.", "authors": ["Jack Hough"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR305_bobbak_MG_20190913154101.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
