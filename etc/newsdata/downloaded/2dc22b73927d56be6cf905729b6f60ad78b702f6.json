A similar regional cap-and-trade program is designed to curb emissions in New York, Massachusetts and other Northeast U.S. states but, unlike the California plan, it does not include international partners.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom blasted the Trump administration\u2019s move Wednesday, casting it as part of a broad \u201cpolitical vendetta against California, our climate policies and the health of our communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s landmark cap-and-trade program has inspired the creation of dozens of businesses, is a model for similar policies around the world and puts California well ahead of the pack as we prepare for a low-carbon future,\u201d Newsom said in an emailed statement. \u201cThis latest attack shows that the White House has its head in the sand when it comes to climate change and serves no purpose other than continued political retribution.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump and California officials have been sparring for years, though the battles have intensified recently over the state\u2019s efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles. California has emerged as a leading legal antagonist of the Trump\u2019s efforts to ease environmental regulations, with the state having filed dozens of suits challenging administration policy actions.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency moved in September to repeal a six-year-old waiver authorizing the state\u2019s zero-emission vehicle mandate and its own limits on tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA also rapped California over water pollution and has accused the state of not doing enough to curb smog.\n\nIn addition to Newsom, the lawsuit names the California Air Resources Board, the Western Climate Initiative and other as defendants. Air Resources Board representatives did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nThe case is U.S. v. California, 19-at-1013, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California (Sacramento).\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Lawsuit argues the state stepped outside its proper constitutional lane by making a deal with the province on carbon-cutting pact", "authors": ["Jennifer A.
