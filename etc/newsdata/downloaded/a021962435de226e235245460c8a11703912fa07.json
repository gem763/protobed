McCarthy then brushed off the exchange by faulting Barack Obama for not selling anti-tank weapons to Ukraine in the first place. His answers only grew more inscrutable. \u201cWhy would we move forward with impeachment?\u201d McCarthy argued. \u201cThere\u2019s not something that you have to defend here.\u201d Michigan Representative Justin Amash, who left the GOP in July, tweeted that McCarthy\u2019s interview \u201cagain displays his unique brand of incompetence and dishonesty.\u201d\n\nOther Trump allies tried to deflect and obfuscate rather than deny. But Miller demonstrated the limits of that tactic on Fox News. \u201cThe president has the State Department,\u201d Wallace asked him. \u201cHe\u2019s got the CIA. He\u2019s got the Pentagon. He\u2019s got a number of other agencies. Why did he use three private lawyers to get information on Biden from the Ukrainian government rather than go through all of the agencies of this government?\u201d Miller instead tried to veer off. \u201cTwo different points: Number one,\u201d he began, before Wallace cut him off. \u201cHow about answering my question?\u201d he asked.\n\nBut Miller, like a Terminator sent back from the future to distribute White House talking points, was relentless. Wallace restated the question a few times before giving up. \u201cYou have your non-answer at this point,\u201d he said. What Miller really wanted to talk about was the \u201cdeep state,\u201d and how Trump\u2019s impeachment woes were all their fault. \u201cThey leak this president\u2019s phone calls,\u201d he complained. \u201cThey publish hit pieces. They publish fake stories.\u201d In reality, it was the White House that released the damning Zelenskiy transcript, not some shadowy cabal of intelligence operatives. And Trump\u2019s own acting director of national intelligence has defended the whistleblower whose complaint led to the disclosure, telling Congress last week that they used the proper legal channels and did so in good faith.\n\nAttempts by Trump surrogates to turn the scandal against Biden also backfired. On CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan, an inveterate ally of the White House, took the opportunity to float corruption allegations against the former vice president. Host Jake Tapper went for the jugular. \u201cI would think somebody who has been accused of things in the last year or two would be more sensitive about throwing out wild allegations against people,\u201d he said, referencing allegations that Jordan turned a blind eye to reports of sexual abuse when he was a men\u2019s wrestling coach at Ohio State University.\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham adopted a largely legalistic defense of the president\u2019s conduct over the weekend. He dismissed the Ukraine scandal as the product of \u201chearsay\u201d by the unnamed whistleblower, who admitted in their complaint that they didn\u2019t personally witness the fateful Zelenskiy call or some of the other events they describe. \u201cThis seems to me like a political setup,\u201d he claimed on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation. \u201cIt\u2019s all hearsay. You can\u2019t get a parking ticket conviction based on hearsay. The whistleblower didn\u2019t hear the phone call.\u201d Again, this argument would carry more water if the White House hadn\u2019t released the memo showing Trump soliciting Ukrainian help against the Biden family.", "description": "The president and his allies' case for acquittal would get laughed out of court.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/da5aa8563eac997948729c32b95cb0e51e4e9df6.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
