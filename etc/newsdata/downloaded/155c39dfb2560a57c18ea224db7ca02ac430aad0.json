Remember, Neville Chamberlin came back after meeting with Hitler in Munich and tried to appease Nazi Germany, told the people of Great Britain they will have peace in their time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut in the end, appeasement never works. Winston Churchill had the moral clarity. He understood the nature of this enemy and he knew there was only one way to negotiate with a tyrant and a killer and a mass murderer like Hitler.\u201d\n\nHannity went on to play Churchill\u2019s famous \u201cblood, boil, tears and sweat\u201d speech.\n\nWatch the clip below:", "description": "The Fox News personality even played an excerpt from Winston Churchill's famous \"blood, toil, tears and sweat,\" speech.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7743e13b0000039fd0c438.jpeg?cache=rb71fjl8jk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
