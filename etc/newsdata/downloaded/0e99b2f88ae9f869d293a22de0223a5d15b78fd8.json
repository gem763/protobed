Instagram will apply the age restriction in cases where posts include an incentive to buy or are accompanied by a price for a product. The company will remove posts entirely if it \u201cmakes a miraculous claim about certain diet or weight loss products, and is linked to a commercial offer such as a discount code.\u201d\n\nInstagram\u2019s advertising guidelines and policies never allowed for the promotion of these products, according to a statement from the company, but recent growth among influencers and celebrities has prompted additional action. The policy will affect both Instagram and Facebook.\n\nThe updated policy is part of Instagram\u2019s work to make the platform \u201ca positive place for everyone\u201d and to \u201creduce the pressure that people can sometimes feel as a result of social media,\u201d Instagram\u2019s public policy manager, Emma Collins, said in a press release.\n\nInfluencers like Kim and Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner have long drawn ire from critics, including actress Jameela Jamil, for promoting weight loss products. One of Jamil\u2019s tweets about influencers on Instagram selling these products, which are potentially harmful to young buyers and oftentimes don\u2019t work, went viral in November 2018, bringing more attention to the issue. Jamil worked with Instagram and other experts to bring changes to the platform, according to a statement.\n\nIf celebs and influencers were actually honest with us about some of these diet/detox products... pic.twitter.com/OQsJobGOQN \u2014 Jameela Jamil (@jameelajamil) November 28, 2018\n\n\u201cAs someone who struggled with an eating disorder for most of my youth, I\u2019ve personally known and suffered the perils of the devious side of the diet/detox industry,\u201d she said. \u201cA focus of our advocacy since inception, it is a proud day for \u2018I Weigh\u2019 and a day of hope for our generation, who deserve respect and protection from the celebrities and influencers that they follow.\u201d\n\nThe company decided to implement the new policy now due to conversations around the \u201crole social media can play in creating pressure for people to look or act a certain way.\u201d The company is asking people who see concerning posts, or cases where the new policy is being violated, to report those instances. Instagram\u2019s press release also states that the policy will \u201cevolve as needed but we believe this a positive step in protecting people on Instagram.\u201d", "description": "Instagram is instituting a new policy around posts that promote weight loss products or types of cosmetic surgery in a move that targets a rapidly growing and controversial sect of influencer marketing.
