Police say he was armed with homemade guns that jammed repeatedly during the attack. American mass killers, on the other hand, typically strike with a cache of military-grade, semiautomatic weaponry.\n\nThat\u2019s in part due to Germany\u2019s strict gun laws. Had the Halle shooter had access to better guns, the bloodshed could have been much worse, experts said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that if he had access to better weapons, the body count would have been higher,\u201d said Vegas Tenold, a journalist and author with the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism. Tenold tweeted a photo of the shooter\u2019s slam-bang tube, adding, \u201cThis is a direct result of Germany\u2019s strict gun laws.\u201d\n\nThe shooter, in a gruesome, 36-minute video livestreamed on Twitch, used his improvised guns to kill two people after failing to get inside a synagogue filled with Yom Kippur worshippers.\n\nHis guns \u2015 including a so-called slam-bang tube and a homemade 9mm rifle \u2015 repeatedly jammed or failed to fire as he attempted to shoot. He said he wanted to prove the effectiveness of rudimentary weapons in a country that makes it hard to obtain semiautomatic guns.\n\nThe shooter in Germany used home made weapons that were low quality and misfired repeatedly. This is a direct result of Germany's strict gun laws. If he had had access to better weapons he would have killed more people. pic.twitter.com/Mo13zRtTJ4 \u2014 Vegas Tenold (@Vegastenold) October 10, 2019\n\nGermany has some of the world\u2019s strictest gun laws. All gun ownership is heavily regulated, and each legal purchase comes with a background check that considers addiction, mental health history, and criminal record. Gun buyers under 25 have to pass a psychological exam, and semiautomatic gun ownership requires special authorization.\n\nGerman gun laws were tightened after school shootings in 2002 and 2009. In turn, shooting incidents dropped dramatically, according to The Washington Post.\n\nIllegal weaponry and DIY guns are still a threat across much of Europe. But shooters need criminal connections to get their hands on semiautomatic firepower that is commonplace in America, said Nils Duquet, a weapons expert in Belgium with Flemish Peace Institute.\n\n\u201cIf you want to buy an illegal gun in Europe, what\u2019s important is having the right networks. For assault rifles, you need better criminal connections,\u201d Duquet told The Washington Post. \u201cBut there are many hot spots in Europe where you can try, and that is what\u2019s worrying.\u201d\n\nTwitter A \"slam-bang\" tube, purportedly cobbled together and used by the shooter in Germany.\n\nAmerica\u2019s gun laws, along with war-torn Yemen\u2019s, are the world\u2019s loosest. The U.S. is averaging more than one mass shooting per day this year. According to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive, 329 mass shootings \u2015 defined as an incident in which four people or more are shot, excluding the shooter \u2015 have occurred in the U.S. in 2019.\n\nMilitary-grade, semiautomatic rifles are often easier to obtain in the U.S. than handguns, and they kill twice as many people as other types of weapons, according to researchers.\n\n\u201cActive shooters are hell-bent on killing people,\u201d Dr. Adil Haider, a trauma surgeon who was the lead author of a 2018 study on weapons used in \u201cactive shooter\u201d incidents, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe big difference \u2014 and this is not such a big surprise \u2014 is if you give them a semiautomatic, they\u2019re able to shoot twice the number of people.\u201d", "description": "The gunman accused of killing two people outside a Halle synagogue was using homemade firearms -- a far cry from military-grade weaponry common in the U.S.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da09aee200000690550003a.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
