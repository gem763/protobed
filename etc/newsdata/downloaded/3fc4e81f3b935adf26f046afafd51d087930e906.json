Researchers estimate a population of between 2 and 6 million is living in North America, causing millions of dollars of damage in at least 39 states and several Canadian provinces.\n\nNow, thanks to a new study, scientists have gained fresh insights into what makes for a successful wild pig invasion.\n\nResearchers used landscape-scale, real-world data to analyze how the availability of crops and non-agricultural food \u2014 grasses, acorns, mushrooms, insects, reptiles and more \u2014 impact the movements and behavior of invading hogs.\n\nUsing GPS data from tagged wild pigs, compiled from 24 previous studies, scientists tracked the movements of pigs in relation to their surroundings. Scientists used USDA crop data to understand how agricultural resources influenced their movements.\n\nThe authors of the new study hypothesized the feral hogs would be more likely to gravitate toward crop lands when natural food resources were scarce. Scientists also predicted higher crop densities would drive higher usage by feral pigs.\n\nThe data \u2014 detailed this week in the journal Ecological Applications \u2014 showed the scientists\u2019 expectations were well-founded.\n\nScientists also hypothesized that as non-agricultural resources increased, pigs would avoid croplands. On farmland, feral hogs are more likely to meet their end. Farmers and hunters are allowed to kill and trap wild hogs without limit. Some landowners capture hogs and sell the meat for profit.\n\nWhile most farmers would prefer feral hogs gone, some landowners welcome their presence.\n\n\u201cManaging populations is difficult because some landowners want wild pigs on their land while others don\u2019t,\u201d Sarah Chinn of University of Georgia said in a news release. \u201cThose that have crops need to control their losses while others might want the wild pigs around for recreational hunting or even profit.\u201d\n\nResearchers hope their latest analysis will help wildlife officials pinpoint locations where feral hog control efforts will be most effective.\n\n\u201cAn improved understanding of foraging behavior will help managers more effectively control invasive pests in the United States and elsewhere,\u201d said Mark Wilber, a postdoctoral fellow at Colorado State University.", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 It\u2019s obvious that wild pigs, or feral hogs, are extremely successful invaders.
