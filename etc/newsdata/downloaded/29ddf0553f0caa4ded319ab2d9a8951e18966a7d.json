along with another meteorite site discovered in Chile.\n\nAn episode of rapid cooling named the The Younger Dryas is a well documented period believed to contributed to the extinction of many species of large animals around 12,800 years ago.\n\nWhile theories previously pointed to this post-ice age cooling as a result of changes in oceanic circulation systems, another theory was presented by American scientists in 2007 - that the cooling was triggered by the dust fall out of an asteroid impact.\n\nDust circulating in the atmosphere after an impact could have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the earth, affecting plant growth and temperatures on earth.\n\nNow Francis Thackeray of the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa believes a platinum spike found in South Africa proves that the extinction of many large animals globally could have been caused by one or multiple meteoroid impacts.\n\nA Meteor glowing as it enters the earth's atmosphere (stock)\n\nDr Thackeray who was working with researcher Philip Pieterse from the University of Johannesburg and Professor Louis Scott of the University of the Free State, said: 'Our finding at least partially supports the highly controversial Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis (YDIH).\n\n'We seriously need to explore the view that an asteroid impact somewhere on earth may have caused climate change on a global scale.\n\n'And [it may have] contributed to some extent to the process of extinctions of large animals at the end of the Pleistocene, after the last ice age.'\n\nMany mammals became extinct in North America, South America and Europe at the time of the Younger Dryas.\n\nIn South Africa a few extraordinary large animal species became extinct around that period including the giant African buffalo, a large zebra, and a very big wildebeest each weighing around 500kg more than its modern counterpart.\n\nHuman populations may also have been indirectly affected at the time in question.\n\nThackeray argues that a dramatic halt in the development of the use of stone tools by the Clovis people in North America and the Robberg stone artefacts used by populations in South Africa around that period could indicate that an asteroid may have caused global consequences.\n\nDr Thackery said: 'Without necessarily arguing for a single causal factor on a global scale, we cautiously hint at the possibility that these technological changes, in North America and on the African subcontinent at about the same time, might have been associated indirectly with an asteroid impact with major global consequences.'\n\nHe added: 'We cannot be certain, but a cosmic impact could have affected humans as a result of local changes in environment and the availability of food resources.'\n\nAt Wonderkrater, the team has also uncovered evidence from pollen to show that about 12,800 years ago there was temporary cooling.\n\nThis linked up with the 'Younger Dryas' drop in temperature that is well documented in the northern hemisphere, and now also in South Africa.\n\nAccording to some scientists, this cooling in widespread areas could have been caused by the global dispersal of platinum-rich atmospheric dust after a meteorite hit.\n\nThackeray's team believes their discovery of a platinum spike at about 12,800 years ago at Wonderkrater is just part of the strengthening view that an asteroid or cometary impact might have occurred at that time.\n\nThis is the first evidence in Africa for a platinum spike leading to the mini-ice age of the Younger Dryas.\n\nYounger Dryas spikes in platinum have also been found in Greenland, Eurasia, North America, Mexico and recently also at Pilauco in Chile.\n\nWonderkrater is the 30th site in the world discovered with evidence of platinum spikes.\n\nThackeray said: 'Our evidence is entirely consistent with the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.'\n\nThe discovery in South Africa is expected to be analysed in context with those made in other parts of the world.\n\nA large crater 31 kilometres in diameter was discovered in northern Greenland beneath the Hiawatha Glacier last year.\n\nThackery recognises that the source of the platinum at Wonderkrater could hypothetically be cosmic dust that was dispersed in the atmosphere after a meteorite impact in Greenland.\n\nThe South African research has been supported by the National Research Foundation and the DST/NRF Centre of Excellence for the Palaeosciences and was published in Palaeontologia Africana.", "description": "Evidence to support the theory that one or multiple asteroids impacted the world leading to global cooling and the\u00a0extinction of large animals has been uncovered at a site north of Pretoria, South Africa.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/09/19433886-0-image-a-5_1570523978990.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
