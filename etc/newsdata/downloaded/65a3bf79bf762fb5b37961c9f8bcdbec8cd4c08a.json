We see this linear contract would be an open door to many new retail traders.\u201d\n\nNov. 6 launch date\n\nUSDT Futures Contracts will be launched on Nov. 14, and simulation will start on Nov. 5. USDT Perpetual Swap will be launched on Dec. 9, and simulation will start on Nov. 30.\n\nFor USDT futures, the contracts will have a fixed delivery date, with the price set at the mean value of the index at the hour preceding delivery. OKEx has indicated that it will use a mark price to calculate users\u2019 unrealized Profits and Losses (PnL) to mitigate unnecessary liquidation in volatile market conditions.\n\nA daily settlement process will move unrealized PnL into realized PnL to ensure higher flexibility of capital utilization. The platform is also offering hedging tools such as insurance to assist traders.\n\nOKEx had confirmed its intentions to launch USDT futures in late September \u2014 the same day as the exchange was once again prompted to refute fresh allegations of manipulative practices such as wash trading on its platform.\n\nEarlier this month, Binance\u2019s newly-launched Bitcoin futures product was an outlier in the crypto spot and derivatives markets, hitting a $700 million record as other platforms saw lackluster activity.", "description": "The world\u2019s 5th largest crypto exchange OKEx is planning to launch Tether futures trading, offering a linear futures contract with leverage of up to 100x", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMWY5YTllNWViMGI1NTNhMWJkNWVlYjBhZWNkOTAxYzkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
