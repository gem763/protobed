They cheered, decked in their Elliott and Dez Bryant jerseys.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in Cowboys Country,\u201d the banner read.\n\nFor large portions of Sunday\u2019s game, it sure felt like it.\n\nDespite the Redskins being at home, Washington\u2019s home opener featured a sea of Cowboys faithful \u2014 as has been customary lately when the two teams meet at FedEx.\n\nThe Redskins reported a paid attendance of 75,128 on Sunday, and based on the noticeable number of Cowboys jerseys in the crowd, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to suggest the rooting interest of fans was evenly split.\n\nThe Redskins even heard chants of \u201cDE-FENSE\u201d at one point \u2014 even though they were on offense.\n\n\u201cYou notice it, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re here to play a game and get a W,\u201d Redskins running back Adrian Peterson said. \u201cWe love our fans, the ones who support us, but it\u2019s about us.\u201d\n\nLast season, Redskins players complained about the atmosphere at FedEx Field. Players like cornerback Josh Norman and former safety D.J. Swearinger bashed fans for booing and spoke out about how many opposing fans fill the stands on game days.\n\nThe criticism didn\u2019t seem to help. Washington saw its attendance drop 19% as it finished its third straight season without a playoff appearance. In Week 17, FedEx Field saw an invasion of Eagles\u2019 fans \u2014 whose green and black jerseys filled seats. The Eagles were in a must-win game for a playoff appearance, while the Redskins had nothing to play for.\n\nThis year\u2019s home opener wasn\u2019t as lopsided, but there were plenty of moments when Dallas\u2019 fans made themselves heard.\n\nAny time Elliott rushed for a first down, fans in the stands would intimate the 24-year-old\u2019s signature \u201cfeed me\u201d celebration. When Amari Cooper hauled in a pass from quarterback Dak Prescott, chants of \u201cCooooooo\u201d filled the stadium.\n\nWashington fans could be heard when Peterson bulldozed his way into the end zone in the second quarter, with the crowd chanting \u201cAP, AP, AP!\u201d\n\nPeterson dismissed the noise from Dallas fans.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let a traveling group of Cowboys fans \u2014 which travels well \u2014 discourage us in any type of way,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
