Green Bay took sole possession of first in the NFC North, while Dallas dropped into a tie for the NFC East lead with Philadelphia.\n\nJones had a career-high 182 scrimmage yards \u2014 107 rushing and 75 receiving \u2014 and opened the scoring with an 18-yard run after being held to 19 and 21 yards rushing the previous two weeks.\n\nOn a punctuating touchdown for a 24-0 lead early in the second half, Jones waved \u201cbye-bye\u201d to cornerback Byron Jones while beating him to the pylon on a 5-yard run. The fourth TD was a 1-yard plunge.\n\nCooper had a 53-yard touchdown among his 11 catches and Michael Gallup had 113 yards receiving with a 40-yard score. Prescott, who had never lost when throwing for more than 275 yards, was 27 of 44.\n\nEMPHATIC CHALLENGE\n\nCowboys coach Jason Garrett was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct when he slammed the challenge flag in front of side judge Scott Edwards after Edwards ruled Cooper out of bounds when the receiver got both feet in on a catch. The call was reversed on replay, but the Cowboys started first-and-25 because of the penalty. Elliott, who had 62 yards rushing, caught a 26-yard pass on the next play.\n\nINJURIES\n\nGreen Bay center Corey Linsley didn\u2019t return after leaving in the first half to be evaluated for a concussion. Packers safety Darnell Savage left with an ankle injury and didn\u2019t return. Cowboys right tackle La\u2019el Collins, who played after being listed as questionable with a back issue, was taken out with an ankle injury in the second half.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPackers: Detroit at home next Monday.\n\nCowboys: at the New York Jets next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Aaron Rodgers looked quite comfortable at the home of the Dallas Cowboys \u2014 again.
