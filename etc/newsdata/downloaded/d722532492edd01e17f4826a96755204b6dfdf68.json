Reminds me of the reaction to the corrupt pols of the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. They have their Dem media trying to destroy my reputation and silence me! pic.twitter.com/xQ2isIPzos \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) September 29, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s over the target:\n\nThink of the Biden arrogance and entitlement to protection. They believe they own the media and they are demanding that they silence me. They know I have incriminating facts, not hearsay, because they know what they did in selling Joe\u2019s office to a Ukrainian crook. \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) September 29, 2019\n\nMaybe team Biden should get their own people on air?\n\nHere\u2019s what would have been smarter: Get your own surrogates booked and arm them with talking points that ensure Biden\u2019s case is made, instead of whatever the fuck has been going on that involves Biden allies sounding like he might actually be sort of dodgy. https://t.co/3O6xNGA5pJ \u2014 Liz Mair (@LizMair) September 29, 2019\n\nAlthough, we expect that they don\u2019t want to answer any questions about Hunter Biden:\n\n1) If I were the Biden campaign, I\u2019d want to see as much Rudy as possible. 2) Biden has been in a bunker on this issue, in terms of fielding serious/sustained Q\u2019s. Maybe Team Biden should stop trying to tell networks who not to book & offer up their candidate to give his side. https://t.co/Mpg7fGy0Bm \u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) September 29, 2019\n\nAnd does team Biden realize that President Trump control a whole lot of classified information right now?\n\nAs if Team Trump hasn\u2019t read and is readying the declassification and release of Biden\u2019s Ukraine & China communications\u2026 \ud83d\ude02https://t.co/CNCvnc8TiE \u2014 Adam Baldwin (@AdamBaldwin) September 29, 2019\n\nGet the popcorn.\n\n***", "description": "\"They have their Dem media trying to destroy my reputation and silence me!\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/7d2ccc6a-215b-4aa5-8388-f50eb4ba5a16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
