We have not seen significant examples of that so far, but we\u2019re very early,\u201d the official told reporters on condition of anonymity.\n\nHe said that the operation launched Wednesday was not yet large-scale, saying the Turks \u201creally have not engaged in great depth or in great numbers inside the border yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one reason why we\u2019re issuing so many warnings, because we\u2019re very, very concerned about such indiscriminate firings,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has come under heavy criticism at home, even among usually steadfast Republican supporters, who say he abandoned US-allied Kurdish fighters who led the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nIn a phone call on Sunday with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump \u2014 a longtime critic of prolonged military involvements overseas \u2014 said he was withdrawing US troops who had effectively served as a buffer preventing a Turkish incursion.\n\nOn Twitter on Thursday, Trump said that he hoped to \u201cmediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds\u201d \u2014 saying the alternatives were sending in \u201cthousands of troops\u201d or hitting Turkey hard with sanctions.\n\nAsked to elaborate on the remarks, the US official said that Trump had asked diplomats to seek an end to the violence.\n\n\u201cWe have been tasked by the president to try to see if there are areas of commonality between the two sides, if there\u2019s a way that we can find our way to a ceasefire,\u201d the official said.\n\nHe noted that Turkey in the past has reached ceasefires with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has waged decades of separatist violence inside Turkey.\n\nErdogan as well as the Trump administration link the PKK to the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Unit, or YPG, which dominates the Syrian Democratic Forces in Syria.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the path that the president would most prefer to do \u2014 a negotiated settlement,\u201d the official said.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Turkey\u2019s assault on Syrian Kurdish forces has not breached a red line declared by President Donald Trump, a US official", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/c7f568_smoke-rises-syrian-town-tal-abyad-in-picture-turkish-border-on-10-2019-on-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
