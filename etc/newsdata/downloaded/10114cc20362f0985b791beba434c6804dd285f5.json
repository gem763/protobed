Karma': Ryan Zimmerman's wife celebrates homer after Trea Turner call", "language": "en", "text": "The wife of Washington Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman spoke for a lot of Nats fans after a controversial call against Trea Turner in Tuesday night\u2019s World Series game against the Houston Astros.\n\nEarlier in the seventh inning, Turner was called out for interference on a throw to first base despite being in the basepath. The play would\u2019ve given the Nationals men on 2nd and 3rd with no outs, instead they had a man on first with one out. The Nationals even filed a protest about the widely-criticized call.\n\nTwo batters later, third-baseman Anthony Rendon hit a two-run homer, largely offsetting the damage a bad call would\u2019ve had.\n\nHeather Zimmerman promptly tweeted what many a Nationals fan was thinking.\n\n\u201cF YES. Karma,\u201d she posted on Twitter.\n\nF YES. Karma. \u2014 Heather Zimmerman (@HeatherZiMS) October 30, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
