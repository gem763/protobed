With Trump, he wants to be me.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly mocked Mr. Schwarzenegger\u2019s low ratings during his brief stint as the president\u2019s replacement host of NBC\u2019s \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d Mr. Schwarzenegger quit the show in 2017 after what turned out to be the show\u2019s final season, citing the \u201cbaggage\u201d that came with the gig. Mr. Trump claimed the movie star was really fired because of his poor ratings.\n\nThe two have been feuding ever since and Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, routinely criticizes the president and his policies, particularly on climate change.\n\nIn his interview with Men\u2019s Health, Mr. Schwarzenegger recalled his relationship with Mr. Trump long before he became president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he fears me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I remember that in the old days, when we went to the wrestling matches, the way he admired people with bodies, and the way they would jump around in the ring, and to perform physical stunts and stuff like that \u2014 he had great admiration for that. And the showmanship \u2014 he had great admiration for that. He asked me, \u2018How do you do that, with the movies? I mean, it\u2019s so believable.\u2019 He drilled down to specific questions that fascinated him. It was about, \u2018How do you sell something?\u2019 Like, a scene. \u2018How do you go and act out a scene so that I get affected emotionally?\u2019 He was fascinated by that.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
