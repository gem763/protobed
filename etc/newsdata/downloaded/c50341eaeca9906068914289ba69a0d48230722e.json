The video-editing app is a simplified, mobile version of Adobe\u2019s more powerful Creative Cloud software, but borrows some key features from Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Audition. For example, there are motion graphics templates from Adobe Stock for smooth transitions and auto-ducking features that balance and adjust audio to the background music.\n\nAdobe says the app is tailored to YouTubers and online video creators, with exporting options optimized for social platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter. That means you can input your video title and add metadata like descriptions in Premiere Rush, without having to go through the process in each individual app. The app also automatically syncs projects to the cloud across desktop and mobile, so you can pick up where you left off on any device.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Creative Cloud subscriber, Premiere Rush is included across various plans. You can pay $9.99 / month for the single app, or it\u2019s included as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan. There\u2019s also a Starter plan, which lets users create unlimited projects but only export three projects for free.", "description": "Adobe\u2019s Premiere Rush CC is now available on Android.
