The Pentagon\u2019s job was to look at different options, he added.\n\n\u201cWe presently have troops in a couple of cities that (are)located right near that area,\u201d Esper said. \u201cThe purpose is to deny access, specifically revenue to ISIS (Islamic State) and any other groups that may want to seek that revenue to enable their own malign activities.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s shift has opened a new chapter in Syria\u2019s more than eight-year war and prompted a rush by Turkey and by the Damascus government and its ally Russia to fill the vacuum left by the Americans.\n\nHis decision has been criticized in Washington and elsewhere as a betrayal of Kurdish allies who had fought for years alongside U.S. troops in a region rich in oil reserves and farmland.\n\nThe New York Times reported late on Sunday that Trump was now leaning in favor of a new military plan to keep about 200 U.S. troops in eastern Syria near the Iraq border. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cNECESSARY STEPS\u201d\n\nTurkey is seeking to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d as a buffer against the YPG militia, the main component of the SDF. Ankara sees the YPG as a terrorist group due to its links to Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey.\n\nA convoy of U.S. vehicles is seen after withdrawing from northern Syria, at the Iraqi-Syrian border crossing in the outskirts of Dohuk,, Iraq, October 21, 2019. REUTERS/Ari Jalal\n\nErdogan has said Ankara will resume its assault in Syria when the deadline expires on Tuesday if the SDF has not pulled back from its proposed zone, which spans much of the border.\n\n\u201cWe will take up this process with Mr Putin and after that we will take the necessary steps\u201d in northeastern Syria, Erdogan told a forum in Istanbul hosted by broadcaster TRT World on Monday, without elaborating.\n\nErdogan has also said Turkey will set up a dozen observation posts in the \u201csafe zone\u201d, prompting criticism from Iran.\n\n\u201cWe are against Ankara\u2019s establishing of military posts in Syria,\u201d Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told a weekly news conference on Monday broadcast live on state TV.\n\n\u201cThe issues should be resolved by diplomatic means ... Syria\u2019s integrity should be respected,\u201d said Mousavi, whose country is a staunch ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was quoted as saying that Moscow, which is also allied with Damascus, hopes its coordination with the United States and Turkey will help security and stability in the region.\n\nTurkey\u2019s nearly two-week old offensive has displaced some 300,000 people and led to 120 casualties among civilians and 470 among SDF fighters, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday. Turkey says 765 terrorists but no civilians have been killed in its offensive.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nOn Monday, Reuters video images showed armored vehicles carrying U.S. troops through the Sahela border crossing into Iraq\u2019s northern province of Dohuk.\n\nAbout 30 trailers and Hummers carrying heavier duty equipment crossed, with troops in cars coming through, an Iraqi Kurdish security source said.\n\nOn Sunday, the SDF said they had withdrawn from the border town of Ras al Ain under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal, but a spokesman for Turkish-backed Syrian rebels said the withdrawal was not yet complete.\n\nTurkish security sources said on Monday Kurdish YPG forces were advancing toward Al Hasakah, which is south of the proposed safe zone, adding some 125 vehicles had already left. They also said more than 80 Kurdish militants had been captured alive or surrendered to Turkish forces.", "description": "The Pentagon is considering keeping some U.S. troops near oilfields in northeastern Syria alongside Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to help deny oil to Islamic State militants, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Monday.", "authors": ["Kawa Omar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443277242&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0HM", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
