Zoe is like me \u2013 she has a very strong shell but she is very gloopy inside.\u201d\n\nEmma was worried her daughter might be murdered at the hands of her partner.\n\n\u201cI was scared she was going to die. I would have dreams she had been stabbed by her ex when she was pregnant. I said to her, he is the type who would throw acid in your face and say: \u2018I can\u2019t have you so no one else can\u2019.\n\n\u201cIf he found out she was here, he would, without a shadow of a doubt, come. Even if it was just to sit across the road and look at her to say, \u2018I know where you live\u2019. For both of my daughters, it has been horrendous knowing what is going on as a mother and worrying night after night thinking I am going to get a phone call.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I can\u2019t even describe the love I had for that man.\u201d\n\nBut things quickly changed when she got to know him and found herself isolated from her family and friends and was forbidden from wearing makeup.\n\nShe adds: \u201cI did not speak to my family because he constantly told me they were out to get me. All the friends he allowed me to have were victims of violence as well. I had a friend who used to come to my place black and blue with blood pouring from her face.\n\n\u201cI used to say \u2018why?\u2019 and she would say: \u2018This is just us, this is how we live\u2019. My husband used to say to me: \u2018She clearly hasn\u2019t done what she is told\u2019.\u201d\n\nEmma also recalls feeling under pressure to have sex with her husband.\n\n\u201cMy husband was a very sexual man. It sounds disgusting now but he had to have sex every night before he went to bed for the whole 18 years. Even if I was pregnant, or had just given birth, or was ill. You name it.\n\n\u201cEvery day for a year, he went on about us having a threesome. In the end, I did it because I couldn\u2019t stand the badgering. He would hit me in places people don\u2019t see. He was also very emotionally abusive. He would say: \u2018Nobody would ever want you\u2019. He was a vile man with a vile mouth. Even the police said: \u2018Don\u2019t let him see the kids, he is mentally torturing them\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe entire burden of cooking for the family fell on Emma, for the duration of their marriage. The only time her ex, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for beating her up, would make her a cup of tea all year was on Christmas morning.\n\nShe says that she tried to get a space in a refuge when she finally managed to escape her abuser but was denied one so was left homeless and was forced to stay with her sister. Emma now works as a support worker for domestic violence victims.\n\n\u201cIt can be tough at times because you are dealing with people who have been where you have so you know where they are,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen will say \u2018I love him\u2019 and I say to my manager: \u2018There is no point in me even saying leave him because unless you are ready you are not going\u2019. Some of the ladies I deal with have been hit really badly but they love them. I know from experience you will not leave them until you find that inner strength.\u201d\n\nStatistics show women are at the greatest risk of homicide at the point of separation or after leaving a violent partner \u2013 some 55 per cent of the women murdered by their ex in 2017 were killed within the first month of separation and 87 per cent in the first year.\n\nEvery week in the UK, two women are murdered by a partner or ex-partner. A woman will try to leave a violent partner an average of seven times before eventually managing to flee.\n\nHolly explains she had never even heard of a refuge until her sister was placed in one \u2013 adding that coming to the refuge had massively helped her.\n\nShe thinks that seeing the abuse her father, whom she no longer speaks to, perpetrated against her mother made her normalise such abuse.\n\n\u201cMe and my sister Zoe seem to go down the route of \u2018he only did this\u2019 because we have seen it so many times before that it is sort of normal,\u201d she says. \u201cWe do not see loads wrong with it. I think dad made us weak. He opened us up and made us vulnerable. I think I have never really understood the difference between \u2018Are you okay babe, are you having fun with your friends? and \u2018Where the f*ck are you?\u2019\u201d\n\nHestia, a charity which campaigns on the long-term impact domestic violence has on children, found some 50 per cent of children who experience domestic abuse as a child go on to endure the same abuse later in life.\n\nZoe says her ex would force her to FaceTime constantly and did it so much that he was eventually fired from his job \u2013 adding that he would go through her phone and question her about things that happened a decade ago.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t relay it word by word, I was disgusting, I was dirty, I was a liar,\u201d she says. \u201cHe used to even go through messages with my mum. I wound up leaving him after just over a year after he really, really beat me up. But coming to the refuge has given me peace of mind and given me myself back. I feel like I can be me again.\u201d\n\nZoe, who has been in the refuge for around six months now, also credits the shelter with giving her a fresh start. But she vents her frustrations about the fact it took her around a year to get into a refuge, due to a lack of spaces.\n\nThose in need of a refuge are finding it more difficult than ever to find an available bed, with the most recent figures showing 60 per cent of them are unable to. Local authority spending on refuges has been cut from \u00a331.2m in 2010 to \u00a323.9m in 2017 \u2013 with several refuges forced to shut in the last nine years.\n\nZoe says her ex turned violent within just a couple of weeks of being with him and quickly pressured her into leaving her job after accusing her of sleeping with both male and female colleagues.\n\nShe adds: \u201cHe quickly wanted children and I had a baby with him. He chucked me out whenever he wanted and threw my stuff out the window. And he became violent, even if it put their baby in danger.\n\n\u201cHe once strangled me when I had the baby in my arms. If we were arguing, the first thing he would do would take my keys, my phone and my bank card. He would smash my phone against the wall and destroy my sim cards so I could not contact anyone. He would lock the front door so I couldn\u2019t go outside.\n\n\u201cHe would cause wedges between me and all my family. I had no friends. The only ones I have now are from the refuge.\u201d\n\nZoe says on one occasion in their relationship he posted an explicit photo of her on Facebook after a fight and in another instance, he broke a court order barring him from contacting her and burgled her house.\n\nShe recounts another incident where he flew into a rage while she was driving on a busy road and tried to steer the car into oncoming traffic before pulling the handbrake. He then dragged her out of the car by her hair \u2013 forcing her and her young children to walk a two-mile journey home in the late evening.\n\nCharlotte Kneer, herself a domestic abuse survivor, is now chief executive of Reigate and Banstead Women\u2019s Aid refuge \u2013 her violent partner was jailed for seven years in 2011.\n\nKneer believes Zoe may not have been forced to experience such abuse if her mother had managed to get a space in a refuge when Zoe was young.\n\n\u201cAn important element of the work we do here is ending the cycle of domestic abuse so it is not passed through generations,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe help women identity signs of abuse so they know what they are looking for and to make sure they don\u2019t enter other abusive relationships in the future. This family is an example of abuse being normalised in childhood and then it recurring.\n\n\u201cThis family shows why being in a refuge is such an important way to stop that happening. Maybe a lot of this horrific abuse might have been avoided if Emma had been able to find a refuge space when the children were younger.\u201d\n\n*The names of the siblings and mother in this article have been changed to protect their identity", "description": "Zoe* and Holly* grew up in a household where their father subjected their mother to psychological and physical abuse and have been exposed to domestic violence since they were born.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim", "Angela Christofilou"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/10/Inside-Womens-Refuge-36.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
