Bush told \u201cThe Daily Briefing with Dana Perino.\u201d\n\nA day after Trump announced that a U.S. military raid had resulted in the death of al-Baghdadi, Biden made a point of not giving the commander-in-chief any credit for the mission.\n\nBIDEN WON'T GIVE TRUMP ANY CREDIT FOR AL-BAGHDADI RAID\n\nIn a lengthy and scathing statement, the former vice president, a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, claimed that the raid happened in spite of -- not because of -- Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad President Trump ordered the mission. But as more details of the raid emerge, it\u2019s clear that this victory was not due to Donald Trump\u2019s leadership. It happened despite his ineptitude as commander-in-chief,\u201d Biden said Monday.\n\nWHO'S LEADING ISIS NOW THAT AL-BAGHDADI'S DEAD\n\nThiessen said Tuesday that Biden probably would not have approved the mission targeting Baghdadi, given his opposition to the May 2011 raid that killed Al Qaeda leader Bin Laden in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cHe said [to Barack Obama], if this goes wrong, you can say goodbye to a second term,\u201d Thiessen said, claiming that Biden\u2019s criticism was \u201cpolitical.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Joe Biden is the guy who advised Barack Obama to pull all our troops out of Iraq in 2011,\" Thiessen said. \"He actually gave a speech where he said it was the proudest moment of his life to call those troops home. That\u2019s what led to the rise of ISIS.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.", "description": "Marc Thiessen pushed back Tuesday on former Vice President Joe Biden over his refusal to give President Trump credit for the raid that led to the\u00a0death of Islamic State (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi over the weekend.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/JoeBiden092319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
