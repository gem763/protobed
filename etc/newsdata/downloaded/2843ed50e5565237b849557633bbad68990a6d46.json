Semiautomatic pistols and shotguns are also included.\n\nCurrent owners were given until the end of the year to choose one of two options: Get rid of their semiautomatics by moving them out of town, disabling them, or turning them over to police \u2014 or apply for a certificate with the Boulder Police Department, a process that includes a firearm inspection, background check and $20 fee.\n\nJudging by the numbers, however, most Boulder firearms owners have chosen to do none of the above, albeit quietly.\n\n\u201cThe firearms community in Boulder \u2014 they may be Democrats but they love their firearms,\u201d said Ms. Hollywood, herself a former Boulder resident.\n\nOne longtime Boulderite who has openly refused to comply is Jon Caldara, president of the free-market Independence Institute, who writes a column for the Denver Post and hosts the public-affairs show \u201cDevil\u2019s Advocate\u201d on Colorado Public Television.\n\n\u201cThe question was, do I do this publicly or do it privately, and I\u2019ve chosen to do it publicly because somebody has to,\u201d Mr. Caldara said. \u201cThere will be thousands of people in Boulder living in the shadows, worried about somebody turning them in.\u201d\n\nWhat made him decide to take one for the team was the specter of the tolerance-espousing Boulder City Council cracking down on a maligned minority, namely gun owners.\n\n\u201cIn this town that spouts tolerance for alternative lifestyles, that actually puts posters all over its buildings and schools about it, when it comes to a lifestyle they don\u2019t like, there is no tolerance,\u201d Mr. Caldara said. \u201cSo for me, this all works around the word tolerance. And tolerance means tolerating things you dislike, that you find scary.\u201d\n\nHow many others are engaged in noncompliance? \u201cWithout a doubt, there are more than 342,\u201d he said. \u201cI think potentially there are thousands.\u201d\n\nThe city council, which has been hit with state and federal lawsuits challenging the ban, took action in response to the tragic Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 dead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud that we\u2019ve taken a stand and become part of the growing movement towards common sense gun control in our country,\u201d said council member Aaron Brockett on Facebook.\n\nCity Attorney Tom Carr has acknowledged that enforcing the ordinance will be a challenge, telling the Boulder Daily Camera that \u201cthere\u2019s no circumstance where we go door-to-door and ask people if they\u2019ve violated the law.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Caldara, who has shared custody of his son with Down Syndrome and teenage daughter, said he\u2019s worried about the consequences. Each violation of the ordinance carries a fine of as much as $1,000 and up to 90 days in jail.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this at all. I\u2019m scared,\u201d Mr. Caldara said. \u201cI do not want to go to jail. I don\u2019t want them to confiscate my guns. I\u2019m scared s\u2013less about what\u2019s going to happen to my kids. The idea of my son being without his dad for three months is awful. I just want some damn consistency.\u201d\n\nBoulder spokeswoman Shannon Aulabaugh declined to comment on his noncompliance, citing his role as a plaintiff in the federal lawsuit filed by the Mountain States Legal Foundation.\n\nOther Boulderites are making their objections known in different ways. A Boulder business owner provided Ms. Hollywood\u2019s group with T-shirts and yellow car stickers with the message, \u201cWe Will Not Comply,\u201d which have popped up on vehicles, guitar cases, even rifle bags.\n\nA rally in April before the council\u2019s vote drew more than 500 supporters to downtown Boulder.\n\n\u201cThat was a neat protest because it really brought out people from Boulder,\u201d Ms. Hollywood said. \u201cPeople you would never expect to be gun owners were standing there, the gun-toting hippies, basically, saying, \u2018Why are you guys doing this to us? We didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and now you\u2019re coming after us.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe city has insisted that certification does not constitute gun registration \u2014 police issue paper certificates and insist they do not keep records \u2014 although Ms. Hollywood refers to it as the \u201c\u2018not-a-registry\u2019 registry.\u201d\n\nGiven that the average gun owner possesses multiple weapons, she said the 342 certificates could have been issued to as few as two dozen residents. She knows one owner who certified four firearms, another who certified eight.\n\n\u201cMost of them are doing five to 10 firearms per person,\u201d Ms. Hollywood said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident it\u2019s somewhere between 20 and 50 people altogether.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
