The Supreme Court ruled last year in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute that the process could go forward. \u201cWe have no authority to second-guess Congress or to decide whether Ohio\u2019s [law] is the ideal method for keeping its voting rolls up to date,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the 5-4 majority, which split along traditional ideological lines. \u201cThe only question before us is whether it violates federal law. It does not.\u201d\n\nThat process isn\u2019t as foolproof as the state made it sound before the high court. To reassure the public about the planned purge of 235,000 registered voters, Ohio officials released the names of every voter who would be swept up in it. According to the Times, activists soon discovered that 40,000 names\u2014roughly one-fifth of the total\u2014were wrongly included on the state\u2019s list for purging. The Times found that one of those names belonged to Jen Miller, the director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio, a voting-rights organization, even though she had voted in the last three federal elections.\n\nThis problem is hardly limited to Ohio. Republican-led states have slashed early-voting hours, closed hundreds of polling places, and erected new logistical and bureaucratic barriers to voting across the country. One study found that Wisconsin\u2019s strict voter-ID policy may have kept between 12,000 and 23,000 otherwise eligible voters from casting a ballot in 2016; Trump won the state by roughly 23,000 votes. A federal judge ruled in 2017 that North Carolina\u2019s voter-ID law violated the Fourteenth Amendment, writing that its provisions \u201ctarget African-Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d\n\n\n\nCandidates don\u2019t need to wait for the moderators to ask a question about voter suppression before talking about it. In Tuesday\u2019s debate, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker managed to discuss abortion rights in a broader conversation about access to health care. A back-and-forth exchange over the Supreme Court in the debate\u2019s third hour would have been a perfect opportunity to note the justices\u2019 role in the voter-suppression war. The Roberts Court\u2019s ruling in Husted and in Shelby County v. Holder, where they gutted a key mechanism in the Voting Rights Act, effectively signaled that court\u2019s conservative justices would not intervene to protect the franchise.\n\nThose who hoped that the Democratic candidates would use Ohio\u2019s struggle to highlight nationwide efforts to undermine the democratic process can take heart at the site of next month\u2019s debate. Candidates will gather again in Georgia on November 20, just over a year after Brian Kemp, Georgia\u2019s then-secretary of state, defeated Stacey Abrams in a gubernatorial race marred by widespread allegations of voter suppression. If the Democratic field can\u2019t find the inspiration to discuss the threat to the rights of voters there, there will be every reason to wonder whether they understand the urgency of an issue to which all their hopes are pinned.", "description": "Four debates in, the candidates have yet to address the ballot barriers and purges that threaten their chances in the next election.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/c28cad8b9b5aa7e046e4caef66ca0fe8236daba7.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
