Judgment in that application has not yet been handed down by the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg.\n\nFormer ANC MP Andrew Feinstein, who raised the issue of the arms deal in Parliament and consistently said the Seriti commission was flawed, believes the judgment on Thursday paves the way for the successful prosecution of Zuma.\n\n\"This judgment has consequences for Jacob Zuma and all those implicated in the arms deal,\" Feinstein told News24.\n\n\"The significance of this decision is that Jacob Zuma and Thales will not be able to use the report of the Seriti commission when they go on trial.\"\n\nFollowing the judgment, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) must also investigate and charge all the others involved in corruption in the deal, including prominent South Africans and international arms companies BAE Systems, Thyssen Krupp, Ferrostaal, Thales and Saab, Feinstein added.\n\nFeinstein also said the judgment was an important legal moment as South Africa attempts to recover from state capture. He added that the arms deal was the first documented instance of state capture.\n\nHe applauded the Right2Know Campaign and Corruption Watch SA for lodging the application, as well as the judiciary, who he said showed their integrity and independence in delivering the judgment.\n\nAs for Feinstein's war against the arms deal, he said the entire saga would reach full circle when he gave evidence against Zuma, and whether the former president was convicted.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
