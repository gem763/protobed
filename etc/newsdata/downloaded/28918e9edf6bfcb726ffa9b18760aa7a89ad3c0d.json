Does he deserve more time? Is he the man to oversee this rebuild?\n\nKlopp certainly was at Anfield. The German finished eighth in his first season after taking over from Brendan Rodgers in October 2015.\n\nFour years later, eight of my combined XI were signed or brought through by him.\n\nThe exceptions are Jordan Henderson, who joined from Sunderland in 2011, and Roberto Firmino, who signed from Hoffenheim in 2015.
