That\u2019s crazy \ud83d\ude33.\n\n\n\nBut u know, there\u2019s 10 BILLION ppl on the planet. The odds of multiple people having the same idea are VERY high.\n\n\n\nThe odds of multiple ppl putting it in song w/ millions of streams are low tho.\n\n\n\nNothin new under the sun. https://t.co/M7fH2ZVXho \u2014 #STREAMTRUTHHURTS (@lizzo) February 9, 2018 Report\n\nMina even tweeted Lizzo, saying: \"Now everyone believes those were your words, when in fact they were mine. My creativity, my wit and my comedy.\"\n\nThe singer replied saying that she had never seen Mina's viral tweet but was \"glad it exists\".\n\nIn their Instagram post, Justin and Jeremiah referenced Mina - saying a meme of the line she tweeted out came up in their writing session and \"inspired the lyric and melody\" of Healthy.\n\nThey added: \"If Ricky and Lizzo's team decide to settle this dispute with us, we would like to share some of the proceeds with Mina for her influence on Healthy.\"\n\nIn a statement to the New York Times, Lizzo's lawyer Cynthia S Arato denied the brothers' claim.\n\n\"The Raisens are not writers of Truth Hurts.\n\n\"They did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else to create this song, and they did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago.\"\n\nNewsbeat has contacted Lizzo's representatives for a comment.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "It's claimed she failed to give a credit to two brothers who say they helped write its famous line.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9F15/production/_109252704_gettyimages-1179500059.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
