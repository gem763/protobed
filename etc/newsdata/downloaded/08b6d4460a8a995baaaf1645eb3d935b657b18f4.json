Acuna failed to run out a long flyball to right field in the seventh inning of the Braves\u2019 7-6 loss to St Louis in Game 1 of the NL Division Series on Thursday night. He admired his drive as he carried his bat with him on his slow jog down the first-base line.\n\nThe bad news for Acuna and the Braves: It was not a homer. The ball hit off the wall, and he had to settle for a single instead of a double.\n\nJimmy Clarke (@JimmyClarke) Ronald Acuna Jr. almost hits a home run but just misses and ends up with a single #ChopOn pic.twitter.com/CS73eMY3Xy\n\nAfter showing lack of hustle in an almost identical play in August, Acuna was pulled out of a 5-3 win over the Dodgers by manager Brian Snitker. Acuna was contrite after that first mistake, and Snitker seemed convinced the 21-year-old All-Star learned his lesson.\n\nNo one was as quick to forgive Acuna after the gaffe was repeated in the spotlight of the postseason opener. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Braves star first baseman Freddie Freeman told ESPN after the game. \u201cBut I think you have that conversation once. It\u2019s kind of beating a dead horse after that if you keep having the same conversation over and over again. You have to know that was a mistake.\u201d\n\nMLB playoff preview: will the Dodgers finally hold their nerve?

Albies said \u201ca couple guys\u201d spoke up in the clubhouse after the game to tell Acuna \u201cjust run out of the box.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a chance to kill the inning,\u201d Albies said. \u201cWe probably score in that inning if he\u2019s at second base. It was a big chance in a tight ballgame.\u201d\n\nSpeaking through a translator, Acuna insisted, \u201cI always try to give my best effort. Those things just kind of get away from me. So obviously I would love to have a double.\u201d Acuna described his mistakes as \u201cthings only happen to guys who are on the bench. You get benched for that.\u201d\n\nThis time, however, Snitker was running out of players and couldn\u2019t afford to remove Acuna from the game as a disciplinary measure. \u201cHe should have been on second,\u201d Snitker said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re kind of short-handed to do anything about it right there. You hate to see that happen.\u201d\n\nAcuna hit a two-run homer in the ninth and also admired the blast before flipping his bat. Freeman also homered as the Braves tried to rally from a 7-3 deficit. The fact the Braves needed one more run to complete the comeback added more attention to Acuna\u2019s mistake in the seventh.\n\nSnitker said he had not yet had the opportunity to speak with his young star. Albies said it\u2019s crucial that Acuna understands the message. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Albies said. \u201cHe needs to do better there.\u201d", "description": "In a one-run playoff loss, Ronald Acuna Jr\u2019s lack of hustle was the obvious mistake the Atlanta Braves couldn\u2019t afford", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe1d2eaaef4a7643b24e4cf4f358bd4662a3215/0_13_2117_1271/master/2117.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=49e845b6fe5898b86420853d29cc38ac", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
