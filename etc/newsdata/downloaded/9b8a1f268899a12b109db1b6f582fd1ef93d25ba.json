We will try to break them down.\n\n\"We are playing in front of our own supporters so we want to be happy at the end of the game. We will do our best.\n\n\"I think it is a dream game. When you play football you dream about these kind of games. As a kid you watched these kind of games but now you are on the pitch playing the game.\n\n(Image: Andrew Powell)\n\n\"Everyone (in Tanzania) is talking about the game tomorrow, talking about Ally and (Virgil) Van Dijk, saying I have to do something against him, go past him, dribble.\n\n\"I think a lot of them will watch the game tomorrow.\"\n\nLiverpool squad: Alisson, Fabinho, Van Dijk, Wijnaldum, Lovren, Milner, Keita, Firmino, Mane, Salah, Gomez, Adrian, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Brewster, Robertson, Origi, Kelleher.", "description": "Liverpool have confirmed their 19-man squad ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Genk in Belgium", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Andrew Powell"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20691382.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-Travel-to-Genk-Ahead-of-Their-Champions-League-Match.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
