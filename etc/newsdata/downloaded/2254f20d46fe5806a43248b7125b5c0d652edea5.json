This is the sort of thing you\u2019d say only if you knew there was no chance of it coming back to bite you. It\u2019s PR to make Republicans seem more open to impeachment than they really are: \u201cOf course, if there\u2019s irrefutable proof that he did the worst possible thing we could think of, which is unlikely, then we would have no choice but to regrettably etc etc etc.\u201d\n\nIf evidence if a quid pro quo were to emerge (and how would it, realistically?), at worst we\u2019d see a replay of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d episode from October 2016. Some congressional Republicans would immediately flee Team Trump, whether out of disgust at his behavior or fear of a coming political backlash. Trump, however, would dig in. His defiance would please grassroots righties. Slowly, the Republicans who ran would start inching back towards his camp. He might lose a few extra votes on removal in the Senate but they wouldn\u2019t get anywhere near the 67 needed to oust him. A legal defense on the quid pro quo would be patched together and would give GOPers cover to support him, however reluctantly. Probably it\u2019d be a constitutional argument: Yes, it\u2019s bad that the president is threatening foreign leaders unless they help him damage presidential candidates from the other party, but yes, he\u2019s entitled to do that under Article II because the president can conduct foreign policy however he likes. The remedy is at the ballot box, not in impeachment.\n\nAnd what if he were to do the same thing in a second term, when he\u2019s no longer accountable to voters at the ballot box? Unclear.\n\nAnyway, this is untrue and we all know it:\n\nCongressional Republicans are skeptical Trump told Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that assistance from Washington was contingent upon his government launching a probe of Biden\u2019s dealing with Ukraine while he was serving as vice president. But Republican sources told the Washington Examiner Tuesday, just before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry, that enlisting a foreign capital to target a Democratic presidential contender would constitute an abuse of power. A Republican insider who has been privy to conversations on Capitol Hill said, \u201cIf there is evidence of a quid pro quo, many think the dam will start to break on our side.\u201d \u201cMaybe if he withheld aid and there was a direct quid pro quo,\u201d said a chief of staff for a House Republican.\n\nThat was published before the transcript of the call was released. Was Trump\u2019s request for a \u201cfavor\u201d in the transcript after Zelensky brought up Javelin missiles enough evidence of a quid pro quo to satisfy Republicans? Considering that only Mitt Romney seems \u201ctroubled\u201d by the conversation today, it appears not. There\u2019s always the chance that the whistleblower complaint will contain proof of a quid pro quo, but how could it? What would that evidence even look like? You\u2019d need some high official who (a) was privy firsthand to Trump\u2019s thinking on Ukraine, (b) observed the president somehow dangling military aid at the Ukrainians, and most importantly (c) is willing to tell the world about it.\n\nJohn Bolton, basically. He\u2019s probably the only person in the world who might conceivably have the goods *and* be willing to share them.\n\nDrucker\u2019s piece is interesting insofar as it\u2019s one in a series of stories over the past 24 hours describing the uncertainty on both sides about how impeachment might play out. Early this morning, before the transcript was released, CNN reported that some House Democrats were nervous that Pelosi had now gone too far in the opposite direction on impeaching Trump. For months she\u2019s resisted the idea at every turn as lefties have begged for action. Now she\u2019s at risk of having leaped before she looked:\n\nMany of the moderate members who have come out in support for impeachment have made their support conditional: If it is true Trump withheld military funding to Ukraine in order to elicit dirt on a political opponent, then it is impeachable. But, Pelosi\u2019s announcement yesterday caught some by surprise even as members were racing to come out in support of impeachment. A senior Democratic aide with insight into moderate Democratic thinking told CNN that many members preferred for Pelosi to wait until the end of the week when the contents of the complaint and transcript were fully known.\n\nIs the transcript enough to convince red-district Democrats to take the plunge? There aren\u2019t many Republican voters out there today who think it\u2019s damning enough to risk ousting Trump from office over it.\n\nOn the other hand, for all the tough talk from Trump aides about how they welcome impeachment, believing it\u2019ll be rocket fuel for GOP turnout next fall, the reality is that they don\u2019t want it. They can and will use it for campaign purposes \u2014 when Pelosi gives you lemons, make lemonade \u2014 but no, of course Trump doesn\u2019t want to spend the next several months bogged down in preparing a formal impeachment defense, not to mention going down in history as just the third U.S. president to be impeached. And if nothing else, it would mean that any small chance of further legislative accomplishments before the election, like the USMCA, would be fully extinguished.\n\nPlus, the conventional wisdom that impeachment will backfire on the party besieging the president is shaky. It could work out that way, of course; Republicans suffered in the \u201998 midterms, a lesson that\u2019s kept Pelosi away from impeachment. But Clinton was a popular president and Trump is not. What Trump has been accused of, using the power of his office to coopt a foreign government into damaging his political opponent, will seem graver to some voters than Clinton\u2019s offenses. And there\u2019s the fatigue factor, in which other voters might tune out the specifics of the Ukraine matter but conclude that there\u2019s too much drama around Trump generally to reward him with four more years. Impeachment could work out for him \u2014 for sure, it\u2019ll increase Republican engagement in the election \u2014 but it\u2019s not a cinch. Both sides are stuck in uncharted territory here.\n\nOne more thought for you on the Republican dam potentially breaking:\n\nOn whether Senators would vote for impeachment, @murphymike says, \"One Republican senator told me if it was a secret vote, 30 Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump.\" #AMRstaff \u2014 Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) September 25, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s Romney earlier today being asked why he\u2019s the only Republican in the Senate who seems willing to criticize Trump on the Ukraine matter. His reply, essentially, is that his colleagues are too intoxicated with the power and prestige of being a senator to care about the good of the country \u2014 although he phrases it much, much more tactfully than that. (\u201cThis is a shot aimed directly at his colleagues and he knew exactly what he was doing. Romney irritation been building since Friday,\u201d claims NYT reporter Jonathan Martin of his remarks.) The not so minor fact that Romney may be the only Republican in the country who\u2019s probably primary-proof in his home state also gives him unique freedom to criticize Trump. He doesn\u2019t mention that.", "description": "Nope.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
