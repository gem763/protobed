Dan Lipinski. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo congress Illinois congressman unfazed by AOC\u2019s endorsement of his rival\n\nRep. Dan Lipinski is shrugging off the endorsement of his liberal challenger by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, telling POLITICO the progressive star\u2019s backing of his \u201cextremist\u201d opponent won\u2019t help knock him out of the Chicago-area seat.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s always a bad idea for Democrats to go after Democrats, especially incumbent members of Congress. But I know that it happens,\u201d Lipinski said.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. We should all be pulling together against President Trump right now. It\u2019s bad when we\u2019re fighting each other and pulling in different directions.\u201d\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t shy away from her endorsement of Lipinski\u2019s opponent, Marie Newman, telling reporters Tuesday night she\u2019s likely to back other primary challengers to her Democratic colleagues in the coming months.\n\n\u201cWe are taking a look into how we can be helpful in transforming the party in 2020,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a quota or a plan but we\u2019re certainly kind of actively looking through and see where we can bring in new people to this institution.\u201d\n\nIllinois Playbook newsletter Our must-read rundown of political news in the Land of Lincoln.

Newman had the backing of major groups like Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America but lost to Lipinski by about 2,000 votes.\n\nLipinski brushed aside those concerns, saying Newman is too progressive for the suburban Chicago district that has steadily trended more Democratic in recent years.\n\n\u201cI think Marie Newman has finally clearly defined for everyone [she\u2019s] an extremist candidate, so I think that\u2019s not going to play very well in the district,\u201d Lipinski said.\n\nJustice Democrats, the progressive group that helped propel Ocasio-Cortez to her upset victory over Rep. Joe Crowley last summer, announced the New York Democrat\u2019s support for Newman on Tuesday. It\u2019s Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s first endorsement of a candidate aligned with the progressive group.\n\n", "description": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has endorsed Dan Lipinski\u2019s primary foe.", "authors": ["Heather Caygle"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/91/4d/88760c344d1f82dd5578a5076e02/190917-lipinski-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
