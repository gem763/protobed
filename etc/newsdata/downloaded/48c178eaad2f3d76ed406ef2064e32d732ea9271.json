Here are some of the key figures in the push for independence:\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras. Photograph: Paul White/AP\n\nOriol Junqueras\n\nThe former Catalan vice-president and leader of the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) party was convicted of sedition and misuse of public funds on Monday and sentenced to 13 years in prison. He was also banned from holding public office for 13 years. He had been in pre-trial custody since November 2017.\n\nJunqueras, 49, was a history professor before going into politics and eventually rising to the top of the ERC in 2011.\n\nSince entering prison, he has taken a more considered approach to the path towards independence than the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, mirroring the growing divisions between the two main pro-independence Catalan parties.\n\n\u201cYou need to have the courage to speak clearly if you\u2019re going to move ahead,\u201d he told Catalan TV last September. \u201cYou have to admit where we are and where we\u2019d like to be. You have to start building again from there and learning from the mistakes that have been made.\u201d\n\nJunqueras has also alluded on more than one occasion to his decision to remain in Catalonia while his former boss fled into self-imposed exile in Belgium.\n\n\u201cI stayed in Catalonia because of the sense of responsibility I feel towards my fellow citizens,\u201d he said in a recent interview with Le Figaro. \u201cSocrates, Seneca and Cicero had the opportunity to flee but didn\u2019t take it. I find that civic and ethical responsibility very impressive.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jordi Cuixart (left) and Jordi S\u00e0nchez.

He is currently attempting to lead a government in exile \u2013 or \u201ccouncil of the republic\u201d \u2013 from his new home in the Belgian municipality of Waterloo.\n\nA Spanish judge dropped an international arrest warrant issued for Puigdemont, 56, after a German court said it would only extradite him over alleged misuse of public funds rather than the more serious charge of rebellion.\n\nHe faces immediate arrest on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds should he return to Spain.\n\nA staunch and longstanding independence campaigner, Puigdemont served as Catalan president from January 2016 to October 2017, when he was sacked by the Spanish government for his independence bid.\n\nHe studied Catalan philology at university before becoming a journalist on the Girona-based daily El Punt and helping to launch Catalonia Today, an English-language paper.", "description": "As supreme court hands down verdicts in trial of 12 separatist leaders, we look at some of the main players", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2faaac67fce5d5fa8c9647bdfd66589a12b07e23/0_159_5083_3050/master/5083.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=66b6b87eff1d2256716f7cc5004cb5d1", "published_at": "2019-02-10"}
