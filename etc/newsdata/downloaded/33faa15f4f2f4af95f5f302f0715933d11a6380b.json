This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country,' Trump said, referencing al-Baghdadi's creation of the Islamic State.\n\nOn June 29, 2014, the group released a video showing a man purporting to be al-Baghdadi giving a sermon at a Mosul mosque.\n\nPresident Barack Obama launched airstrikes against IS beginning that August. He acted after thousands of Iraqi Yazidis, followers of an ancient religion with ties to Zoroastrianism, were targeted by al-Baghdadi's fighters, and to safeguard U.S. interests, including a consulate in the Iraqi Kurdish regional capital of Irbil.\n\nIslamic State militants responded by beheading Western captives, beginning with freelance American journalist James Foley, and posting their deeds in gruesome online videos.\n\nPictured, President Trump announces the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Washington DC on Sunday\n\nThis November 2012, file photo, posted on the website freejamesfoley.org, shows American journalist James Foley while covering the civil war in Aleppo, Syria\n\nThis file image made from video posted on a militant website Saturday, July 5, 2014, purports to show the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, delivering a sermon at a mosque in Iraq during his first public appearance\n\nIslamic State militants responded to Obama-led airstrikes in August 2014 by beheading Western captives, beginning with freelance American journalist James Foley.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead,' Trump said from the Diplomatic Reception Room, where just a week earlier he announced a ceasefire between Turkey and the Kurds.\n\n'He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world,' he continued as he described the events of the raid.\n\n'He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way. They were led to certain death,' Trump detailed. 'He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast, the tunnel had caved in on it, in addition.\n\n'But test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification. It was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him.'\n\nPeople look at a destroyed houses near the village of Barisha, in Idlib province, Syria, Sunday", "description": "Diane Foley thanked Donald Trump via the James Foley Foundation page after the president announced the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Sunday from Washington DC.", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/00/20260982-0-image-a-63_1572221558931.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
