Indeed, one Cambridge college did not offer a single place to a black student between 2012 and 2016. It\u2019s a similar story at Oxford, where as many as one in three colleges failed to offer a black student a place in 2015.\n\nIt is depressingly clear that Oxford and Cambridge do not reflect the diversity of British society, and this inevitably results in black Oxbridge students like me experiencing alienation, because we feel that we have no place there. Recent social media campaigns like \u2018I, Too, Am Cambridge\u2019, and the \u2018Black Men of Cambridge\u2019 have sought to raise awareness of these issues.\n\nAs a former president of the Cambridge University Student Union\u2019s Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) campaign, I have also had a unique insight into how severe these issues are. This is why the scholarships for Cambidge students being offered by Stormzy, a grime artist who unapologetically celebrates black culture in his work, are instrumental in deconstructing narratives about the nature of black people, which result in disenfranchisement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing a black prospective student for Cambridge was intimidating for me \u2013 not just because of the academic rigour, but also because I knew I did not \u2018fit in\u2019. My socio-economic background \u2013 black and growing up on a council estate \u2013 was completely at odds with the white and wealthy hegemony found at the university. Indeed, I was the only black girl I knew of at my college for three of the four years that I studied there.\n\nStormzy\u2019s scholarship shows that black people, whatever their background, have potential, are intelligent, and are aspirational\n\nThis is why Stormzy\u2019s scholarship intervention is vital. Firstly, it ensures that black people, who on average earn less than white families, are not held back from attending the most prestigious universities in the country.\n\nAdditionally, it plays a key role in tackling stereotypes that black people are lazy, do not care about education, and are criminals. Stormzy\u2019s scholarship shows that black people, whatever their background, have potential, are intelligent, and are aspirational. Most importantly, it shows we have the right to be in these spaces.\n\nThere are, of course, many other reasons why the scholarship is so sorely needed. Cambridge\u2019s issues on black diversity are merely a manifestation of a broader issue of structural racism both in British education, and society at large.\n\nFor example, not only are black students grossly underrepresented at Oxbridge, they are less likely to get a place than a white person with the same grades.\n\nStudies show that stereotypes of black students and pupils, from as young as preschool, result in issues like black children being \u2018marked down\u2019 in the classroom. Indeed, I remember my head of maths at school telling me: \u2018You work hard, considering you are black\u2019. I was 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis underestimation of black people in education is chronic, and goes all the way to the top rungs of academia. Statistics show that there are merely 25 female black British professors in the UK.\n\nThis sort of stereotyping manifests itself beyond education. For example, black people are routinely underestimated or overlooked in the workplace, with stories from MP Dawn Butler Brent describing her being mistaken for a cleaner, or people automatically assuming her white office manager is her boss.\n\nIn a society with such severe structural racism, rooted in stereotypes about black people and our cultures, scholarships from people like Stormzy have never been more important. They smash stereotypes, demonstrating that black culture, like grime, is not incompatible with academic aspiration. Black people have as much a right to be in elite academic spaces as white people do.\n\nMORE: Getting into Oxbridge as a working class minority is one thing \u2013 feeling like you belong is another\n\nMORE: Love Island could teach Oxbridge a thing or two about diversity\n\nMORE: Cambridge Uni accepts more Eton grads than black men", "description": "This underestimation of black people in education is chronic, and goes all the way to the top rungs of academia.", "authors": ["Nadine Batchelor-Hunt"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1172887833_1571053236.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
