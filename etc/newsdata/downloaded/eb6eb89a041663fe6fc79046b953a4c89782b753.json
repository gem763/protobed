Brown \u2015 meets a teenage boy interested in dating his daughter Deja (Lyric Ross).\n\nRandall and his wife, Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson), recently moved their family from the New Jersey suburbs to Philadelphia for his job, so they\u2019re trying to help their kids, including daughters Tess (Eris Baker) and Annie (Faithe Herman), adjust to a new normal. Raising a teenage daughter who has an older boyfriend is definitely uncharted ground for Randall, but he\u2019s excited to get to know Malik (Asante Blackk), a schoolmate whom Deja has been talking to for a few weeks.\n\nThat is until he finds out the 16-year-old is a father himself.\n\n\u201cWhen my daughter gets old enough, I plan on installing a tracking device on her,\u201d Malik laughs while a slightly confused Randall stares down at him during their first meeting. As Malik realizes Deja didn\u2019t tell Randall about his 6-month-old daughter, Janelle, he explains that he has full custody and occasional child care support from his parents.\n\nFor Lyric Ross, playing out this complicated plot point is a thrill, albeit a surprising one. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know how much more they could do with this character,\u201d Ross, who is 16 herself, told HuffPost. \u201cShe was a foster kid, adopted as part of the family \u2015 I didn\u2019t know they could take it even further with a whole different storyline.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to portray someone who\u2019s trying to overcome a tragic past, but Ross said the loyal \u201cThis Is Us\u201d audience keeps her eager to bring Deja\u2019s story to life. The character has really resonated with the show\u2019s viewers, whether they\u2019re personally familiar with the foster care system or not.\n\n\u201cThey see all of this hurt that this girl\u2019s feeling,\u201d Ross said.\n\nDeja was introduced in Season 2. Viewers learned that her mother had her when she was 16 and struggled to raise Deja alone following her grandmother\u2019s death. After the little girl was hospitalized with a bad cut to the hand, Child Protective Services noticed some inconsistencies in Deja\u2019s home life and put her in the foster care system. She rotated through a few homes \u2015 some abusive, some over-crowded \u2015 before she was reunited with her mother. But then her mom was arrested for possession of an unlicensed gun. That\u2019s when a 12-year-old Deja was placed with Randall and Beth, who eventually became her permanent guardians when her mother realized they could provide her daughter with a more stable life.\n\nAt first defiant, Deja comes to love the Pearsons and forms a beautiful bond with Randall, who was adopted himself by Rebecca (Mandy Moore) and Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia) after one of their triplets died during childbirth.\n\nRoss, joined by her mom, Brandi, talked to HuffPost about her journey as Deja and what it means to play a Black foster kid on primetime TV.\n\nRon Batzdorff/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images Lyric Ross as Deja on \"This Is Us.\"\n\nDid you always know you wanted to be an actor?\n\nI\u2019ve been wanting to act since I can remember. And it\u2019s funny, I would always change what I wanted to be, but I would never change acting. Like, I always wanted to be an actress and an astronaut, or an actress and a scientist, or an actress and a fashion designer. Then I grew up and finally said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to focus on acting.\u201d It\u2019s pretty much what I wanted to do my whole life.\n\nDo you remember your first audition?\n\nMy first audition was for an agency and I did a monologue from [Disney sitcom] \u201cGood Luck Charlie.\u201d I had to be 5 or something. [Pause] That\u2019s crazy! Thanks for having me remember that!\n\nA trip down memory lane! So what was the first role you ended up booking?\n\nI was about 9 and it was this commercial called \u201cMadam President\u201d for Hillary Clinton. And I don\u2019t think it was supposed to be on TV or anything \u2015 it was just like an internet commercial [for EMILY\u2019s List], but I saw it on the news one day. I literally saw my face on TV and I was so fascinated by that. I didn\u2019t even see that coming!\n\nWas that the first time you realized that acting could be something that would work out for you?\n\nI never really thought about this being something that I should be doing. I just always knew I loved it so much so I wanted to do it. So it was pretty much just like, \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter if it works out or not. I just want to work. I just want to do what I\u2019m passionate about.\u201d When I got the part on \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d I didn\u2019t even know how big the show was until people started telling me. It was really just work!\n\nYou were 13 when you got the role of Deja on Season 2. When you auditioned, did you know that the character would be a series regular?\n\nWhen I got the part, I was told I had two or three guaranteed episodes. But I put my all into those episodes and I guess when they saw me do that, they wanted to keep me around to do more. That was pretty awesome.\n\nA lot of people responded to the character. It was eye-opening to see a storyline of a young Black woman in the foster care system \u2015 an arc that hasn\u2019t really been explored in this way on primetime TV. Was it powerful for you to bring Deja\u2019s story to viewers?\n\nIt was very different because I\u2019ve never played someone like that before. That role pretty much stretched me as an actress. I had to do a lot of research because I did not know anything about foster kids. And the writers were so detailed about this character that I really just focused on their words and bringing them to life. When it came to acting with all of this hurt that this character had \u2015 all of the dark emotions and how she was so shy and closed-in because of everything that happened to her \u2015 it was a lot. It was a lot to deal with when the cameras would roll.\n\nWhat did you pull from to get into that mindset? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard when you don\u2019t really know the experience of being in foster care, but you have to accurately portray it on screen.\n\nThis character had so much going on in her past, and she\u2019s the type that will have all of that build up until she explodes. And I\u2019m kind of the same way when it comes to that. I\u2019ve never been in her situation, of course, but I can relate. So I kind of just put a little of myself into the character at times.\n\nI think that\u2019s why your performance feels so real \u2015 you\u2019re authentic. Is that something that made you realize you could really dig into this character and explore her more?\n\nI tried to do that with my tape for the audition actually. Boss Mom, my very loving, caring, kind mom [Mom laughs], has always seen something in me that I never really saw. She\u2019s always been the one to push me, even when I don\u2019t want to be pushed. Like, I hate practicing, right? So I really had to dig into this character for that audition and it took a lot of energy. I wanted to take a nap, I wanted to play games, but my mom was like, \u201cNo, you gonna do this.\u201d So shout out to her, because I don\u2019t think I would have gotten that part if it weren\u2019t for her. She pretty much told me to dig through that character and, actually, dig through myself.\n\nWhen you talk about your mom, it makes me feel like she\u2019s your real-life Randall.\n\n[Mother and daughter laughter] Yeah, Randall is much nicer though. [More mother and daughter laughter]\n\nHow is it to play opposite Sterling K. Brown? He\u2019s a powerhouse, but you guys do have this great on-screen connection where Randall really pushes Deja to be the best version of herself \u2015 to try new things, to kind of get out of her head. It must be exciting to learn from and work with an actor like him.\n\nMan, Sterling is awesome. He\u2019s so great. After the cameras are off, he won\u2019t try to go his own way but he\u2019ll take time to get to know you. If ever you need anything when it comes to acting \u2015 if you need help delivering a line \u2015 he will help you. He\u2019s pretty much there for you, which is great. I love that about him. And when it comes to that connection with our characters, he\u2019s that person I can feed off of. When we have those types of scenes together, he\u2019ll just put something out there and I\u2019ll just grab it and I\u2019ll take it and I\u2019ll throw something out there and he\u2019ll take it. It\u2019s that kind of communication through acting and I love stuff like that.\n\nHis character is adopted, as well, and he also feels like somewhat of an outsider in the Pearson family. Did you talk about your characters having similar viewpoints in life?\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about how Randall tends to think that we\u2019re in the same kind of situation and that\u2019s part of the reason why he adopted [Deja]. For him, he\u2019s trying to pretty much make it easier on Deja, but it\u2019s kind of not working because Deja isn\u2019t yet comfortable talking about everything that\u2019s happened in her past. And she knows that everything she\u2019s been through is not even close to what Randall has been through. So yeah, we\u2019ve had conversations about how to go about some scenes we\u2019ve done, especially when it comes to those adult conversations. Sterling is very open when it comes to helping people out, so I\u2019ve had questions sometimes about how to go about the delivery of things. We\u2019ve just connected when it comes to understanding what\u2019s going on between those two characters.\n\nI just remember that beautiful scene where Deja is talking to Randall about how everyone sleeps. He starts crying and you\u2019re clearly holding back a flood of tears when you say, \u201cI\u2019m really tired.\u201d Is it hard to play out those emotional scenes?\n\nEspecially when you have to cry. I\u2019m not a crier at all. Like, I will watch probably the saddest movie and my eyes would stay dry.\n\nSo you don\u2019t cry during \u201cThis Is Us\u201d?\n\nNo! [Laughs]\n\nI cry every week.\n\n[Laughs] It is sometimes challenging for me to bring on the tears. And when I say Sterling is so helpful, he told me the key to crying on demand is it\u2019s easier when you\u2019re drinking water \u2015 when you keep downing a lot of water. And I tried it one time and it did not work! And I was like, \u201cOK, well, how am I going to bring this emotion and cry?\u201d It\u2019s just a lot to put in a scene. So I started praying, right? I actually started praying. I was like, \u201cGod, bring these tears so I can deliver this message.\u201d And right after that, they just started falling. The emotional part is easier for me. When it comes to actual tears, that\u2019s different.\n\nYou relate to Deja in that way, though, since she doesn\u2019t really break down those walls very easily. What kind of response have you gotten from viewers, not only in the foster care community but around the world, who\u2019ve seen this character and responded to her story?\n\nThere are a lot of people who have actually been through this kind of stuff. These people have went through this, these people have been Deja. So for them to come up to me and tell me, \u201cYou\u2019re really giving these people what they need to hear\u201d \u2015 it\u2019s definitely very humbling. And even people who have never been through anything like that but they want to adopt because of what they\u2019ve seen on \u201cThis Is Us\u201d \u2015 I mean, that\u2019s incredible. They see all of this hurt that this girl\u2019s feeling. ... They can actually look deep. I\u2019m just glad I can help people see that. That gives me a lot of joy.\n\nMan this episode hits me like crazy. I\u2019ve been through every situation Deja has plus more in the foster care system. Being in there since age 9 made me grow thick skin #thisisus then trying to explain all of it to my kids was even worse \u2014 ~Akilah (@akilahbee) March 7, 2018\n\nThis season you have such a rich storyline with Deja and her love interest, Malik, who has a young daughter. Their relationship opens up an even bigger conversation about how a foster child born to a teenage mom will handle dating a young man with a baby. Were you excited to see that arc for Deja, or was it a little terrifying that you\u2019d have to dive into a new situation?\n\nYou know what? When we started auditioning for that part, all I saw was that Deja was going to have a boyfriend. I didn\u2019t know all of the extra stuff that was connected to that boyfriend. I was like, \u201cCool, it\u2019s just going to be an extra thing in her storyline.\u201d But it\u2019s so much more. This is a whole love story between two young Black people. It is so rich and amazing. I cannot wait for you to see more of what\u2019s to come with Deja. It\u2019s fascinating.\n\nHow was it to work with Asante Blackk, who\u2019s had a big year already with \u201cWhen They See Us\u201d?\n\nAsante is incredible. Like, he is so good it sometimes makes me mad. We would have these back-to-back scenes together and I would try to be doing my part \u2015 you know, I want to do good, too! But he would just come out and just completely destroy me. It\u2019s like, \u201cGive me a break! I\u2019m trying hard over here.\u201d He would come in, like, \u201cThis is nothing. It\u2019s just another day at work.\u201d He\u2019s such a natural. So natural. And incredible to work with. He\u2019s amazing at what he does.\n\nDoes that pairing make you even more excited to continue on with this character? Because, like you mentioned before, you didn\u2019t even know you would get more than three episodes.\n\nI didn\u2019t really know how much more they could do with this character. She was a foster kid, adopted as part of the family \u2015 I didn\u2019t know they could take it even further with a whole different storyline. If they can do that, who knows what they\u2019re going to do in the next season, or even in the next episode!\n\nI think that every season.\n\nThe actors put a lot into our characters, but it\u2019s easier for us because the writers put so much meat into their scripts. So it\u2019s just like, \u201cOh, we got it down, now!\u201d We don\u2019t really need to make a whole world for our characters because they pretty much break it down for us. That\u2019s all the writers, man.\n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d has this ability to interconnect viewers through stories about family and identity and race and ability. But why do you think so many people watch it and respond to the characters and storylines?\n\nIt\u2019s a relatable show, and some of the situations that they put out there people don\u2019t even think about having a conversation about. Some people keep stuff in. I remember I was sitting down, watching the show with my mom and my grandma, and my grandma has been through a lot in her past and she\u2019s never been the type of person to actually bring anything up. But she saw something in one of those episodes and she kind of just broke down into tears because it reminded her of a situation that she went through not too long ago. After those tears come down, you feel a sense of lightness and it\u2019s like all this weight just falls off of you. I think that\u2019s one reason why people love the show.\n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on NBC.", "description": "The young actor was told she\u2019d play foster kid Deja for just a few episodes.
