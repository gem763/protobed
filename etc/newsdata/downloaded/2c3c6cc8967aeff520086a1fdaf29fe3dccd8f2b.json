Jim Jordan said he expects Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz to report that all four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants against one-time Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained.\n\nThe Ohio Republican was asked for his prediction at the end of an interview on Fox News host Sean Hannity's show Monday night.\n\n\"I think he will. Michael Horowitz does good work,\" Jordan said.\n\nFox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett agreed, saying, \"Absolutely.\"\n\nThe investigation into alleged FISA abuse against the Trump campaign by DOJ and FBI officials has reportedly been completed. After a declassification period, the report could be released sometime in September. The contents of the report have not been confirmed.\n\nAttorney General William Barr, who is overseeing U.S. Attorney John Durham's investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation, said he is working closely with Horowitz, and they will take up any criminal referrals Horowitz might make.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova said he has heard the initial FISA warrant against Page and the three renewals at three-month intervals were illegally obtained. He told the Washington Examiner's Examining Politics podcast late last month that he got his insider information because the report is \"being circulated inside and outside of the department for comment by interested parties.\"\n\nJordan, a member of the Judiciary Committee, also said he wants Horowitz to testify about his blistering reports on former FBI Director James Comey and slammed Democrats in control of his committee for focusing on impeachment.\n\nJordan said the question he is most asked is, \"When is somebody going to jail for wrongdoing that took place in the Trump-Russia investigation or even the Clinton investigation?\"\n\nIn order to \"get to the bottom of that,\" Jordan reasoned that \"all\" the information needs to be aired out. \"And what better opportunity then to bring in the inspector general to answer our questions?\" he said.", "description": "Rep.
