Only Hall of Famer Kurt Warner (24) had better opening run. \u2026 Mayfield threw three TD passes and three picks in season finale against Ravens as rookie. \u2026 Browns WR Odell Beckham Jr. has been dealing with double teams so far, but still had team-high six catches against Rams. \u2026 Beckham had eight catches for career-high 222 yards in only game against Ravens for Giants in 2016. Beckham has averaged 128.8 yards per game in four games against AFC North teams. \u2026 Browns DE Myles Garrett has six sacks this season and 26 1/2 in 30 career games. \u2026 Browns will play four of next five games on road. \u2026 Browns RB Nick Chubb was held to 24 yards on nine carries in 2018 season finale at Baltimore. \u2026 Ravens RB Mark Ingram leads NFL with five rushing TDs, ranks fifth with 257 yards on ground. \u2026 Baltimore owns plus-3 turnover differential and plus-9 in last six games against Cleveland. \u2026 Ravens 10-1 at home against Browns under coach John Harbaugh, who started in 2008. \u2026 Baltimore QB Lamar Jackson has thrown 221 passes without INT, longest current streak in NFL. \u2026 Ravens tight ends have combined 33 catches, 389 yards and three TDs, all NFL highs for position. \u2026 Ravens\u2019 defense burned for 503 yards last week. \u2026 Baltimore\u2019s 1,535 yards on offense after three games second most in NFL history behind 2011 Patriots (1,621). \u2026 Ravens CB Brandon Carr expected to make 180th consecutive start, longest current streak among defensive players. \u2026 Baltimore 66-23 at home under Harbaugh, 18-2 in September. \u2026 Ravens K Justin Tucker\u2019s 90.3% success rate on FGs best in NFL history.
