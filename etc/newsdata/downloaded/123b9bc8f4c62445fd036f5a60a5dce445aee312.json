One idea for the internal firm data is emulating the Tax Office, which released aggregate tax details about the big four partners when queried about the matter by a Senate committee.\n\nThese two data sets, inspection findings and firm data, will allow the market, and the audit inquiry, to assess audit quality and potential conflicts of interest in the way the firms are structured. Then possible solutions can be examined.\n\nSecrecy prevails\n\nThe firms do not reveal detailed information about their audit quality inspection beyond their aggregate results, citing client confidentiality. Internally, they review their audit work but these findings are never made public.\n\nThe auditors' main professional body, Chartered Accountants ANZ, does not assess the quality of the work of the big four firms.\n\nAcademics are split due to the lack of access to ASIC's data. Some say that without insight into ASIC's inspection regime they can\u2019t assess its quality. Others say that ASIC is only measuring process and has not shown any link to outcomes such as corporate failure. Another group has looked at proxy measures to generally conclude that the quality of audits is actually pretty good in Australia.\n\nThat leaves case studies of collapse. The problem here is that proving a link between audit quality and corporate collapses is difficult and cases that allege auditor wrongdoing often settle before they reach formal hearings.\n\nASIC has already said it will break out the audit statistics of individual firms when it next publishes its audit inspection report but it needs go further and reveal the full cache of audit data it possesses.", "description": "ASIC needs to find a way to share the detailed results of its audit inspection program to allow a frank assessment of audit quality in Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_79/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/75449e4415d06c406f63abbe205aca4175efdae8", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
