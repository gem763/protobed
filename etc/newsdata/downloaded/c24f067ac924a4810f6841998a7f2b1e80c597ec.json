So they could be some of these others that have already been named or perhaps something new.\n\nWe\u2019ve no doubt fans will be going over everything with a microscopic in the following days, so if more are discovered we\u2019ll update this page.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield will be released on 15 November, only on Nintendo Switch.\n\nImpidimp was in the E3 demo we played in June\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: are pok\u00e9mon being made into sausages?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Nintendo might have accidentally leaked Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield evolutions\n\nMORE: Sirfetch\u2019d confirmed real and a Pok\u00e9mon Sword exclusive", "description": "A 24-hour livestream for Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield has revealed a new version of fire horse Ponyta, as well as a bunch of other pok\u00e9mon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/newpokemon04106-fe1a_1570293487.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
