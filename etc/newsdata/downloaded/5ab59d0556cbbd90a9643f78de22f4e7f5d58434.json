I read it, because as someone who\u2019s experienced breast cancer I\u2019m always interested in the latest news about it.\n\nThe new research doesn\u2019t apply to me: I wasn\u2019t taking HRT when I was diagnosed aged 51, and like most breast cancer survivors, HRT isn\u2019t an option for me now. The latest news is about the risks being higher than previously believed, but researchers have long known there\u2019s a link. In fact it would be remarkable if that wasn\u2019t the case, since for so many women, me included, breast cancer is connected to hormones, which HRT is all about.\n\nWhat my brush with breast cancer taught me above all was that it\u2019s vitally important to be vigilant\n\nSo my main thought wasn\u2019t really about HRT. Instead, it was about how terrified many women would be reading that headline. I remember so well that grip of fear; for many years, my life was blighted by it. Breast cancer seemed everywhere, and somewhere inside I suspected it was only going to be a matter of time before I got it myself.\n\nThe weird thing is that the reality of having it turned out to be nothing like as terrifying as the fear that I\u2019d get it. Of course, hearing I had cancer was an appalling blow initially. There were a few weeks when my life was entirely dominated by the need to get information \u2013 from a whole raft of tests and operations; about how serious it was; and what could be done about it. But once I and the specialist had all the information, and had worked out a treatment pathway that would both hopefully banish the disease and work for me, I realised things weren\u2019t nearly as bad as I\u2019d feared.\n\nThe worst thing about getting cancer was the finding out, and the information-gathering \u2013 after that, there was a route to sorting it out.\n\nSadly, of course I know that\u2019s not how it is for every breast cancer patient. But for a majority of us, my experience is typical. Certainly when I was \u201cin the system\u201d I was very aware that I was surrounded by doctors and caregivers who were used to dealing with women like me for whom the disease would be a temporary problem, rather than a death sentence. More and more women, and again I was lucky enough to be one of these, are also able to deal with breast cancer without losing a breast or having major changes to their bodies. Oncoplastic surgery, which allows surgeons to remove the tumour and rearrange the breast tissue so you\u2019re left virtually unscathed, is improving all the time, and I was very much a beneficiary of it. So too are tests that identify whether or not you need chemotherapy: again, I was one of the lucky ones.\n\nBreast cancer risk from using HRT is \u2018twice what was thought\u2019 Read more\n\nWhat my brush with breast cancer taught me above all was that it\u2019s vitally important to be vigilant, to report changes, to listen to your instincts (three doctors told me I didn\u2019t have cancer, before it turned out that I did) and to seek out information if it\u2019s confirmed you do have a tumour. But I wish I hadn\u2019t spent so long living under a cloud of fear, because the reality wasn\u2019t as bad as the anticipation.\n\nPanic, I learned, is the worst way to respond to cancer: it\u2019s entirely understandable, but it doesn\u2019t help in any way. The new research, when you read it all through calmly, shows that the risk of breast cancer if you\u2019re taking HRT is up slightly; so you have a 6% chance of it anyway, between the ages of 50 and 69, and if you\u2019re taking HRT, that rises to 8%.\n\nNow that\u2019s important to know, but it\u2019s equally important not to panic about. If you\u2019re affected by the story, talk to a medic who knows their stuff on it \u2013 that\u2019s well worth your time. You need to weigh up the risks based on your individual attitude to life in general, and to risk-taking in particular. After all, you\u2019re a whole person, not just a potential breast cancer candidate: in my experience, you make the best choices for your health if you keep that very much to the front of your mind.\n\n\u2022 Joanna Moorhead writes for the Guardian", "description": "The best thing is to talk to a doctor then make your own choices, says Joanna Moorhead, who writes for the Guardian", "authors": ["Joanna Moorhead"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d29d0f56568c4a80e046e785e67baa5e2ea4dd5/0_227_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6d3647d3e0c074d50ab3301c9254a21c"}
