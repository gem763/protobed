Sorry, obviously because of our big scoop.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"Good you managed to get 87 plugs in the end there so well done. We\u2019ll get you back on for a more extensive interview.\"\n\nMockingly gesturing with his clasped fist, Stephen cried out: \"Damn that Jennifer.\"\n\nGiggling Susanna Reid replied: \"You\u2019re probably not the only one saying that this morning.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nStephen was left in hysterics earlier in the quick chat when Piers asked if he'd had an affair with Boris Johnson .\n\nThis came after the presenter had repeatedly asked American businesswoman Arcuri whether she had an \"intimate relationship\" with the Prime Minister.\n\nWhen asked if he had an affair with Boris, stunned Stephen replied: \"Not yet. Fingers crossed.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAttention then turned to fresh-faced Stephen's youthful good looks - with Piers asking if he was in \"good health\".\n\n\"You look svelte and well and handsome, which I\u2019m not enjoying at all,\" confessed Piers.\n\nSusanna Reid then asked Stephen to reveal his secret to the viewer at home.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"I don't know why,\" admitted Stephen as he hilariously licked his finger and stroked his eyebrows.\n\n\"I\u2019m trying to keep fit. We've just done Catchphrase, Simon Cowell\u2019s new show called Rolling In It. All is good.\"\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "The much-loved TV presenter jokingly shook his fist as Boris Johnson's former friend after Piers Morgan apologised", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529011.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MDG_18171JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
