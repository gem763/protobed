The two people hired by the Buttigieg campaign now work in technology-related roles. One is a senior digital analytics adviser, while the other is an organizing data manager.\n\nButtigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is one of several people seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination for president.\n\nThe Buttigieg campaign didn\u2019t respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment, but spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed the reporting to CNBC. He said the recommendations were made \u201caround the launch when we were getting a ton of incoming resumes.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Lis Smith, Buttigieg\u2019s senior communications adviser, emphasized that the recommendations were made on behalf of potential hires asking for an introduction to the Buttigieg campaign \u2015 not the other way around.\n\n\u201c[This is] a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing,\u201d Smith wrote Monday. \u201cWe get [recommendations] from hundreds of people and we\u2019ve received thousands and thousands of resumes.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg addressed the matter in a Monday morning press conference, where he said his emails aren\u2019t an endorsement of the candidate. He portrayed his emails to the campaign as not much more than sending over the resumes of colleagues who\u2019d asked him to put them in touch.\n\n\u201cI did a Facebook live event with [Buttigieg] a couple years back, so it\u2019s widely known that I\u2019ve met him,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nIn almost any other context, this would be a non-story. Bosses provide letters of recommendation all the time.\n\nBut given Facebook\u2019s extreme political influence, and the numerous fronts on which the tech giant is defending itself \u2015 claims of bias, proposed regulations supported by Buttigieg\u2019s competitors, profiting off foreign election meddling, the company\u2019s own high-level right-wing ties, and a written policy of allowing politicians to lie, to name a few \u2015 any wisp of preferential treatment for the site (or from it) is a bad look for an ascendant presidential candidate.\n\nNot helping appearances: Zuckerberg is an acquaintance of Buttigieg, who often notes he was Facebook\u2019s 287th user. (At that point in its existence, Facebook was a very different website, a fact that Zuckerberg keeps lying about in an apparent attempt to rewrite history.)\n\nZuckerberg also visited Buttigieg in South Bend in 2017.\n\nWhile some presidential contenders, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have publicly disavowed high-dollar fundraisers, Buttigieg has accepted plenty of Silicon Valley cash. He defended his fundraising sources last week, telling Snapchat\u2019s Peter Hamby, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to beat [President Donald Trump] with pocket change.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Buttigieg hasn\u2019t been critical of the social media platform, which he\u2019s warned has too much power and has \u201ca David mentality when they\u2019ve increasingly turned into Goliath.\u201d But unlike Warren, Buttigieg has stopped short of full-throated calls for tech monopolies like Facebook to be broken up.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), like Warren, is a proponent of regulating Facebook, having sounded the alarm on \u201cunchecked corporate power\u201d earlier this year.\n\nRelated...\n\nDemocratic Candidates Turn Fire On New Front-Runner Elizabeth Warren\n\nIowa Gets A Taste Of The New, More Aggressive Mayor Pete Buttigieg\n\nMark Zuckerberg Cites The Iraq War In Defense Of Allowing Lies On Facebook\n\nLove HuffPost?
