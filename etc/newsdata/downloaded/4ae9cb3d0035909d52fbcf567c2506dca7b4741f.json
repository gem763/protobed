SPH\n\nTravel retailer DFS Group, which surprised workers at its Scotts Road shop last week by asking them to go immediately, is now offering them help to get another job.\n\nIn its first comments on the issue, DFS said yesterday that it will work with the relevant agencies in the next several months to provide its retrenched staff with support services.\n\nThese include outplacement assistance with personalised one-on-one career coaching, job matching and retraining, as well as counselling service to those who need it.\n\nIts move follows criticism from Manpower Minister Josephine Teo last Saturday, when she said DFS Group could have handled the retrenchment exercise better, especially in the way it was communicated to the workers.\n\nRead also: DFS is pulling its tobacco and alcohol business from Changi Airport in June 2020 \u2013 this is the reason why\n\nIn its statement yesterday, DFS said that in the past week, it has increased its \u201cengagement and dialogue\u201d with the Manpower Ministry, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices and the Taskforce for Responsible Retrenchment and Employment Facilitation.\n\nEfforts were also made yesterday to inform the workers face-to-face about the support measures available to them, said its spokesman.\n\nHe also said workers at its liquor and tobacco concession operations at Changi Airport have been given termination letters and will leave in June next year, when DFS officially gives up the concession.\n\nHowever, he did not specify the number of workers laid off but said they included employees at T Galleria and DFS\u2019 shared services centre in Chai Chee. Some at these two places were asked to go immediately while some will leave in the next several months, he added.\n\nRead also: DFS is now selling duty-absorbed alcohol online \u2013 and each person can buy up to 40 bottles per day\n\nThe company blamed the layoffs on the tough travel retail market, a situation made worse by the steep losses suffered by its liquor and tobacco concession operations at the airport.\n\nThe \u201cworkforce reduction exercise\u201d was a difficult decision, but \u201cwe remain committed to carrying out this exercise in a fair and sensitive manner. We have in place a series of measures to assist affected staff\u201d, the company said.\n\nThe measures, it added, are aligned with the Tripartite Advisory, which sets out what a responsible employer should do in the event of a retrenchment exercise.\n\nMeanwhile, DFS pledged to continue to work closely with the Taskforce for Responsible Retrenchment and Employment Facilitation, Workforce Singapore and external outplacement agencies \u201cto provide support to affected staff in their transition in the next several months\u201d.\n\nRead also: Job openings in Singapore have declined \u2013 and there were only 94 vacancies for every 100 unemployed people in June", "description": "Business Insider - DFS said it will work with the relevant agencies in the next several months to provide its retrenched staff with support services..
