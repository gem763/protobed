Pederson presumably predicted the win to shake up his team, to inspire confidence and fire them up. He needed something to dig his 3-3 team out of a rut. He needed to do something big to get a proper response in a key game.\n\nNow what?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Eagles were horrible on Sunday night in a 37-10 loss. They started slow, again, and were down 27-7 to the Cowboys by halftime. This was an enormous game in the NFC East and for the Eagles\u2019 playoff hopes, and they had no juice whatsoever. It looked more like a preseason game to the Eagles, and a playoff game to the Cowboys. When the Eagles had a tiny chance at a miracle comeback in the fourth quarter, Carson Wentz threw an interception and dropped a shotgun snap for a fumble on consecutive possessions.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nPederson tried predicting a win in the Eagles\u2019 biggest game of the season to date, and the players had their worst performance of the season. Now it\u2019s Pederson\u2019s mess to clean up. He\u2019s going to have a long week in Philly.\n\n\u201cI feel like he got a statement today,\u201d Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence, who wasn\u2019t pleased with Pederson\u2019s comments, told NBC\u2019s Michele Tafoya after the game. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let him go sleep on it.\u201d\n\nDallas Cowboys wide receiver Amari Cooper (19) makes a catch over Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills (31), though it was called back due to a penalty. (Getty Images)\n\nEagles look bad in loss to Cowboys\n\nThe Eagles\u2019 night started bad. Dallas Goedert lost a fumble on Philadelphia\u2019s first drive of the game. The Cowboys scored a few plays later. It didn\u2019t get better after that.\n\nStory continues\n\nPederson was celebrated as one of the NFL\u2019s best coaches after masterfully leading the Eagles to a Super Bowl title. He out-coached Bill Belichick in a Super Bowl, and that would be the first line on almost any NFL coach\u2019s resume. Last season looked like a big disappointment until a late rally led by Nick Foles made everyone forget about the start. This season is shaping up as a bigger disappointment, and Foles isn\u2019t around anymore for late-season heroics.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been one big reason for the Eagles\u2019 failure. Against the Lions, they dropped a ton of passes. Against Atlanta, the defense allowed a long game-winning touchdown by Julio Jones on a fourth down. That\u2019s still the Falcons\u2019 only win of the season. The secondary, thinned out by injuries, was shredded last week by the Vikings. On Sunday the Eagles\u2019 normally strong offensive line struggled, the defense missed a ton of tackles and turnovers were a problem again. It\u2019s actually more difficult to figure out what Philadelphia did well on Sunday night.\n\nIt seems like in each loss, there\u2019s a different problem. Pederson deserved kudos for his acumen during that Super Bowl season, but he also has to take heat for this Eagles season in which his team has been sloppy and unprepared at times. Maybe all that praise for the championship season was premature.\n\nDoug Pederson needs to find some answers\n\nIt\u2019s not like the NFC East race is over. Dallas is 4-3, a game ahead of Philadelphia, and has its own issues. But the Cowboys struck a big blow on Sunday night.\n\nPerhaps more important, the Eagles looked overwhelmed. At no point on Sunday night did they look like the better team.\n\nThe Eagles are unquestionably talented. They have stars everywhere on offense and defense. Plenty of the key parts of the Super Bowl team are still on the roster. Wentz has been seemingly healthy and mostly played well this season, and it hasn\u2019t mattered much. Injuries have affected Philadelphia, but the Eagles are far from the only team in the league dealing with that.\n\nThe answers are hard to come by, but it\u2019s on Pederson to figure it out or this talented Eagles team isn\u2019t going anywhere. That\u2019s a guarantee.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at shutdown.corner@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!
