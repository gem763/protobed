This model recently released, and it features a True Tone display that can adjust to the ambient lighting in a room.\n\nAccording to our review, this laptop is a nice upgrade if you have an older MacBook Air. The current MacBook Pro will be a better fit for power-hungry applications, since it has a quad-core processor by default (compared to the Air\u2019s dual-core CPU), but this price drop makes this MacBook Air tempting. It usually costs $1,099, which puts it $200 under the cost of the new MacBook Pro model, but today\u2019s deal at Best Buy widens the price gap to $400.\n\nIf you missed out on the Amazon Prime Day deal for Echo speakers, a few deals are back on at retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and B&H Photo. The Amazon Echo (second generation) smart speaker normally costs $99.99, but it\u2019s only $49.99 at B&H Photo, Best Buy, and Target through today. Amazon isn\u2019t offering this deal, but at these other retailers, this sale price matches the lowest that we\u2019ve seen yet.\n\nFor something a little smaller and more affordable, the modest Echo Dot (third generation) is once again down to $24.99, just two dollars shy of its best price ever, at Amazon. You can get the same price at Best Buy, as well.\n\nThe Google Pixel 3 (unlocked, 64GB) starts at $499.99 at Amazon. If you want a larger display that features QHD resolution and a notch, as well as a slightly bigger battery, the Pixel 3 XL starts at $599.99 at Amazon.\n\nBest Buy is offering the same deal on unlocked phones, though you can get the Pixel 3 for $399.99 if you activate it through Sprint at checkout. Verizon and AT&T are each offering the phone for $449.99 with activation.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen both the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL sell for these price points before, and even though they lag behind current Android flagship phones with last year\u2019s Snapdragon 845 processor, they will be among the first to get Android Q and, of course, their excellent cameras might make it worth jumping on for you. The last thing to note is that the Pixel 4 is likely to release in October 2019. It\u2019s confirmed so far to have face unlock and Project Soli, Google\u2019s radar sensor that lets you adjust controls with gestures.", "description": "Best Buy has taken $200 off of the 2019 MacBook Air laptop, bringing the price down to $899 for a limited time. The decision between the Air and the Pro is tough, given their usual $200 price difference, but this makes the Air the easy winner.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GTDgHC8yxQghoqTEpQ6I7RaX5MA=/0x138:2040x1206/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18311971/vpavic_190711_3549_0014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-05"}
