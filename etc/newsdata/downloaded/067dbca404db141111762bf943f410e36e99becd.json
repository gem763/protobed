The characterful President will be replaced by controversial Merkel protege Ursula von der Leyen, a clear indication of the direction of travel for the European Union.\n\nReflecting on his time as President, Juncker recognised Brexit as one of the defining features of pan-European politics over the past five years, remarking: \u201cIn truth, it has pained me to spend so much of this mandate dealing with Brexit, when I have thought of nothing less of how this union could od better for its citizens. A waste of time, and a waste of energy.\u201d\n\nDespite the pessimistic outlook, the Luxembourger continued that the Commission \u2014 led by his colleague President Donald Tusk \u2014 had worked \u201ctirelessly\u201d to negotiate deals with the United Kingdom to govern Brexit. He said: \u201cWe now have a new agreement which again creates the legal certainty for an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.\u201d\n\nNO EXTENSION: EU\u2019s Juncker Says Brexit \u2018Has to Happen Now\u2019 \u2013 Deal or No Deal https://t.co/Rqmhvh8jvb \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 17, 2019\n\nWhile the aftermath of the Brexit vote has been perceived to have sucked all oxygen out of the European Union\u2019s high-level meetings for the past three and a half years, the drain on Juncker\u2019s governing time began before that. Prior to the 2016 referendum, then-British Prime Minister David Cameron attempted renegotiation of the country\u2019s relationship with the EU, hoping that by showing the British people the European Union could be reformed from the inside and was hence worth remaining in.\n\nNegotiated from summer 2015 until February 2016, the package of reforms were generally much less than had been hoped would be possible, and the British people when polled were found to be of the view that the renegotiation had failed.\n\nThat the ongoing Brexit process continues to be a drag on the European Union\u2019s hopes an aspirations, clearly felt by Mr Juncker, is something also felt by French President Emmanuel Macron, who has repeatedly expressed his frustration that discussions have prevented him imposing his vision for a new Europe. Macron has been the key driving force behind attempting to finish Brexit sooner rather than later, insisting he didn\u2019t want the next EU mandate to be \u201cpolluted\u201d by Brexit as Jean-Claude Juncker today admitted this now ending one had been.\n\nSpeaking in June, Macron said the rapidly approaching October 31st Brexit date was the \u201cfinal, final deadline\u201d and that there would be no extensions, comments he repeated last week when he said there would be no extension if the United Kingdom failed to ratify the new deal.", "description": "Top Eurocrat Jean-Claude Juncker has articulated an evidently growing feeling within the European Union that the protracted Brexit process has robbed the bloc of the chance to advance its plans for years, calling the process \"a\u00a0waste of time, and a waste of energy.\"", "authors": ["Oliver Jj Lane"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177527373-e1571756156752-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
