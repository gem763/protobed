(Binance\u2019s recently launched dollar-linked stablecoin BUSD is notably not supported.)\n\nUsers who already have deposits with Binance.com will not see their funds automatically transferred to the U.S. platform, Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley previously told CoinDesk. Users for the new exchange will also receive a $15 referral bonus until Nov. 1.\n\nRegulatory barriers\n\nIn June, the Malta-based Binance, initially launched in China, revealed that stateside users of its global platform Binance.com were barred from trading.\n\nIn the same month, the company said it would partner with California-based BAM Trading Services to set up Binance.US as its US platform. BAM is registered as a money services business with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) with an address listed in San Francisco, California.\n\nWhile the U.S. entity would clear regulatory and compliance barriers, the new platform is still not supported by 13 states, as of Sept. 23, according to a statement from the company.\n\nUsers in those 13 states, including New York, Florida and Texas, cannot register for an account at Binance.US. Coley previously explained that the U.S. rollout is to be \u201cgradual\u201d with the 13 states not supported at launch.\n\nThe exchange said it would also strengthen its compliance and security practices through partnerships, most notably with software provider Chainalysis and KYC/AML tool provider IdentityMind.\n\nGlobal expansion\n\nThe move is part of a larger expansion by Binance, which launched a fiat-to-crypto exchange on the island of Jersey, a British self-governing dependency in January.\n\nThrough that exchange, which caters to traders in Europe and the U.K, its users can trade bitcoin and ethereum against the British pound and the euro.\n\nThe Jersey arm listed the cryptocurrency exchange\u2019s own British pound-backed stablecoin, Binance GBP (BGBP), offered on the fiat-to-crypto platform due to trader demand for more stablecoin options, the company said.\n\nWith its latest launch in the U.S., Binance has also been trying to push its US dollar-backed stablecoin posing as a potential rival against Libra. BUSD has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao via CoinDesk archives", "description": "Binance.US, the American arm of the largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, says trading will start on Sep 24.", "authors": ["David Pan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3AaLv_ZBPOBzE9XfNR789A--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/e2cf57440f819559ad57dfd663a9079b", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
