For example an \"A\" is worth a tenth of a point. Each letter thereafter is worth an additional tenth. Had Biles\u2019 beam dismount been awarded a \"J,\" that skill would have been valued as a full point.\n\nKyodo via Newscom\n\nWhen questioned why FIG decided to give the dismount what was considered to be a lower value, the federation released a statement, essentially calling the skill a safety risk for other gymnasts to try.\n\n\"In assigning values to the new elements, the WTC takes into consideration many different aspects; the risk, the safety of the gymnasts and the technical direction of the discipline,\" the statement read.\n\n\"There is added risk in landing of double saltos for Beam dismounts (with/without twists), including a potential landing on the neck. Reinforcing, there are many examples in the Code where decisions have been made to protect the gymnasts and preserve the direction of the discipline,\" the statement continued. \"The WTC\u2019s task is to ensure the safety of all athletes around the world and decisions are not based purely on one gymnast.\"\n\nLaurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nThe backlash from Biles' camp after FIG\u2019s value was announced was swift, with Biles tweeting out that the ruling was \"bulls--t.\" Her coach, Cecile Landi, tweeted the decision was \"#totalbs.\"\n\n\"If it were [a gymnast from] another country trying it, it would definitely be a J. But because it\u2019s me, it\u2019s so unfair, because, am I in a league of my own? Yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t credit me for what I\u2019m doing,\" Biles said in an interview with NBC Sports. \"They keep asking us to do more difficulty and to give more artistry, give more harder skills. So we do, and then they don\u2019t credit it, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. They keep asking for more, we give them more and they don\u2019t credit it. So what\u2019s the point of even asking? If you\u2019re going to give it an H, nobody\u2019s going to try it. But if you give it a J, not saying people will try it more, but at least it makes sense to try it because it\u2019s something to shoot for.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics, the sport\u2019s governing body, also released a statement on Biles\u2019 dismount, saying, \"USA Gymnastics respectfully disagrees with the value assigned to the balance beam dismount.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics statement regarding the double-double beam dismount valuation. pic.twitter.com/Ae4vmaFmy8 \u2014 USA Gymnastics (@USAGym) October 4, 2019\n\nRegardless of the value of the dismount, Biles is consistently beating out every other gymnast in the world by points, not tenths.\n\nTeam USA competes in the team finals on Tuesday and individual all-around finals -- where Biles is a massive favorite -- are on Thursday.", "description": "Controversy ensued when Simone Biles' beam dismount was valued as an \u201cH,", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/simone-biles-rt-jt-191007_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
