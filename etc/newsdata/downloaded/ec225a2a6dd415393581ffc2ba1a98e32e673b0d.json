Some users claimed they had received automatic refunds ranging from 20 yuan to 264 yuan ($2.80-$37), depending on what packages they subscribe to.\n\nTencent declined to comment on refunds.\n\nThe Houston Rockets became the most popular NBA team in China after drafting Chinese player Yao Ming with the first overall pick in the 2002 draft. He became a star and helped build the NBA's following in China.\n\nTencent extended its NBA partnership through 2024-25 season in July, according to an NBA statement. The value of the deal was not disclosed, but Chinese sports news portal Lanxiong Sports reported it was worth about $1.5 billion.\n\nNearly 500 million people watched last season's NBA games on Tencent's video platform, up threefold since the 2014-15 season, Tencent said in July.\n\nTencent isn't the only company distancing itself from business dealings with the NBA. Chinese Smartphone maker Vivo, state-run broadcaster CCTV and sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd (2020.HK) all halted cooperation with the NBA on Monday.", "description": "NBA fans in China seek refund from Tencent as streaming suspended", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF980A8_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
