Wochit\n\nD\u00eda de los Muertos or the Day of the Dead is often confused as the Mexican Halloween because of its use of skeletons and when the holiday is celebrated: Oct. 31 to Nov. 2. It's actually an Aztec holiday that originated in southern Mexico and celebrates the remembrance of family members and friends who have died. During this time, it is believed that the passageway between the real world and the spirit world opens so loved ones who have died are able to come back and visit. It is a holiday for family and friends to make peace with the inevitability of death and to remember loved ones. Today, the holiday is celebrated throughout Mexico and many parts of the U.S. Here\u2019s a brief look at the festivities that are associated with the holiday:\n\nDays of celebration\n\nFlowers, food, altars and music are an essential part of the festivities. Family members clean and decorate the gravesites of loved ones with skulls, garlands, candles and marigold flowers. Foods such as sugar skulls, sweet bread rolls and drinks are placed alongside clay decorations and personal items on Ofrendas (altars) to memorialize those who have passed. Family members believe their loved ones will feast on the \u201cessence\u201d of the foods from the altars \u2013 either a table at home or on the grave itself.\n\nItems often found on Ofrendas\n\nLoading...\n\nAztec mythology influences\n\nWith its mythology mixed with Aztec and Catholic influences, D\u00eda de los Muertos is rich in history. It dates back as far as 2,000 years: The Aztecs believed the spirits of their ancestors passed on to the underworld. Colorful mystical creatures called Alebrijes were introduced to the holiday in the 1930s. With exaggerated bodies with stripes and dots, they are considered creatures from our dreams and from the realm of the dead.\n\nMiclantecuhtl, the god of the dead, and Mictecacihuatl, his wife and the goddess of death, rule the underworld of Mictl\u00e1n. She is the protector of the departed, helping them into their next stages. It was in the early 1900\u2019s where artist Jose Guadalupe Posada drew a satirical version of a fancy female skeleton in a decorative hat, that became one of the many symbols of the Day of the Dead.\n\nRegions of the holiday\n\nModern observances vary throughout Mexico, but many include parades with colorful floats and festivals with popular foods and drinks. Those celebrating often appear with skeleton-like face paint.\n\nMigration of a celebration\n\nDue to the lack of Mesoamerican influence in the northern regions of Mexico, the Day of the Dead was not celebrated throughout the country. During the early 21st century, the celebrations began to expand from the southernmost regions of Mexico and became the national holiday it is today.\n\nSOURCE dayofthedead.holiday/history; britannica.com and USA TODAY research", "description": "The Day of the Dead isn\u2019t Mexican Halloween.
