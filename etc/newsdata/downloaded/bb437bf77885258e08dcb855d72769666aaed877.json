next week, arguing it is incompatible with EU law.\n\nThe Friends of Antique Cultural Treasures company (Fact) says the ban takes away the level playing field as the rest of the EU still permits an ivory trade, although the European Commission is considering a ban in line with the UK\u2019s.\n\nThe group also says the ban amounts to \u201csevere interference with fundamental rights and freedom\u201d to enjoy their personal property.\n\nThe UK is the world\u2019s largest exporter of legal ivory, in particular, selling to the hot spots of Hong Kong and China, according to the Environmental Investigation Agency.\n\nBut the Ivory Act, seen as one of the world\u2019s toughest clampdowns on ivory sales, was passed in December and is due to take effect later this year.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is

But to this day, the antiques dealers haven\u2019t got this message,\u201d said Denise Dresner of AfE.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, elephants don\u2019t have any rights that are recognised in law \u2013 not even the right to not be killed and have their tusks hacked off \u2013 but they have a moral right to life and to survival.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken years of unrelenting pressure, campaigning and public activism to achieve an ivory ban in the UK, and a very robust one at that.\u201d\n\nNo cultural treasures would be harmed by the law, she added.\n\nThe activists will protest outside the High Court before Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cThe decision of a single judge could potentially undo years of campaigning and reject the overwhelming public demand for this ivory ban,\u201d Ms Dresner added.\n\nIn 1989 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species granted elephants the highest level of protection, banning international ivory trade.\n\nAs a result, poaching subsided and ivory prices tumbled.\n\nBut the ban allowed trade in pre-1947 antique ivory to continue, along with domestic ivory markets.", "description": "Antiques dealers are attempting to overturn the UK\u2019s new ban on trading in ivory in a legal case being seen as a critical battle for African elephants.
