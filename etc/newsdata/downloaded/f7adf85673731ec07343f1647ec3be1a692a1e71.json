And Ireland aimed to exploit the conditions with a strategy of relentless kicking in the opening minutes.\n\nSamoa were singing in the changing rooms after their final training session before this game. But their performance hit a flat note in just the fourth minute, when the Samoa pack was shunted backwards with ominous ease by a lineout drive that Rory Best finished.\n\nThe Pacific Islanders then lost hooker Seilala Lam to the sin-bin for a dangerous tackle on Jacob Stockdale. Tadhg Furlong then steam-rollered his way over the try-line \u2013 but not before delivering a little show-and-go that\u2019s not usually part of a tighthead\u2019s repertoire.\n\nWhen Sexton scored Ireland\u2019s third it looked like Samoa were not only in trouble but already dead and buried. Ireland won by 31 points the last time these countries met six years ago, and for a moment that looked like a conservative estimate for this game\u2019s winning margin.\n\nSamoa skipper Jack Lam had other ideas, however, finishing off strong work by his pack to dot down.\n\nThen came Aki\u2019s dismissal. There was general sympathy around the ground for the centre. The occasion was of special significance to Aki, who was playing against the country of his ancestry. And after a display against Russia in which the ball appeared to have been the proverbial bar of soap, he had had the Samoan midfield in a lather with a series of powerful carries through midfield.\n\nIreland\u2019s numerical disadvantage did not show and on the stroke of half time Sexton punched through the short-side to give Ireland a 26-5 lead at the break.\n\nJordan Larmour scored Ireland\u2019s fifth try down the right on 50 minutes and with the job done Sexton kicked the conversion and left the field.\n\nTJ Ioane, the Samoa flanker, was yellow-carded as Samoa began to buckle under the pressure of constantly defending in their own half. CJ Stander and Andrew Conway added the gloss for Ireland.\n\nIreland were patchy in places. Their kicking game went awry at times, as did their handling, and their scrum took too long to start firing.\n\nJoe Schmidt\u2019s eyes will now turn to the greater Tokyo area, where Hagibis is causing destruction.\n\nIf the Japan-Scotland match is called off in Yokohama, then Japan will be awarded two points and top the pool. That would set up a quarter final for the host nation against South Africa, while champions New Zealand would await Schmidt\u2019s side.", "description": "Ireland secured a quarter-final showdown with either champions New Zealand or South Africa with a bonus-point win against Samoa, despite playing the majority of the game with 14 men.
