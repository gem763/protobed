It sounds like a wonderfully skewed version of a beauty pageant, with entrants tasked with swimming underwater for as long as possible; posing for an underwater photoshoot (hence all the smiling); designing a costume that reflects the plight of our oceans; and strutting the catwalk in the more traditional \u201cswimwear\u201d round (although this does at least make slightly more sense for women who spend a lot of time in the water).\n\nFirst things first, a mermaid has to learn about her fellow sea creatures. The morning sees me get an intense lowdown on the marine life likely to form my personal posse should I ever find myself living Under The Sea for real, with a visit to Sea Life Brighton. After a whirlwind tour in which I meet the resident octopus, stroke a starfish and walk underneath the centre\u2019s brand new feature, an underwater tunnel from where I spot grinning manta rays and brooding sharks, I get up close and personal with the attraction\u2019s two sea turtles.\n\nIt\u2019s feeding time and their handler shows us how to attract Lulu and Gulliver using a stick topped with a red ball, before shovelling lettuce, broccoli and cucumber into their hungry mouths. Wise, hooded eyes sparkle up at me from a prettily painted face, more giraffe than turtle with its brown dappling, and I feel, if not quite like a mermaid, like an utterly enchanted human being.\n\nAll things mer are definitely back in vogue right now thanks to the announcement that a live-action remake of Disney classic, The Little Mermaid, is in the works, and Sea Life Brighton is leaning hard into the zeitgeist with a summer-long Mermaids and Pirates theme. This weekend will see merpeople, including Jasz, diving inside one of the centre\u2019s tanks, plus doing meet-and-greets with the hundreds of enthralled children who have flocked to see them.\n\nIf mermaid-ing seems a niche pursuit to get involved with, I quickly realise it\u2019s nothing compared to some of Jasz\u2019s other myriad professions, past and present: close-up magic, burlesque and fire performing all form part of the extensive list. At the moment much of her focus is on living her best mermaid life in preparation for the pageant \u2013 and Sea Life Brighton have even stepped in to sponsor her as an entrant.\n\nIt\u2019s time to see what she can do in the water and (hopefully) master the art myself. At the local pool, the first step is learning some breathing techniques before we take the plunge.\n\n\u201cTake a deep breath in,\u201d says Jasz, \u201cThen blow out three times \u2013 we call them candle-breaths. Then breathe in again.\u201d\n\nThe first step is to just hold it as long as possible without pushing myself too far. I find it strangely calming; it\u2019s so quiet without the regular in-out of my noisy, inflating lungs.\n\n\u201cForty-five seconds, not bad for a first try!\u201d she tells me. It turns out Jasz can hold her breath for minutes at a time, a key skill if you want to perform in tanks as a mermaid without scrambling for the surface like an ungainly guppy every 10 seconds. Much like with freediving, experts also become skilled in knowing how much air to take in depending on how deep they want to go \u2013 acting, essentially, as their own flotation device.\n\nNext up it\u2019s the swimming technique, the idea being to create a flowing movement by rolling your body. Arms out, feet together, the move involves sticking out the chest before concaving the stomach. It feels extremely odd to be standing in a shallow pool in the middle of the day, undulating for a very small audience of strangers.\n\nWhat felt weird standing up in the pool feels even weirder immersed in water. My feet are connected by a mono-fin to help me get into the groove, and a less-than-glamorous black scuba mask goes over my eyes and nose until I feel bold enough to try opening my eyes underwater (always horrendous from past experience). The first try, I feel exactly like a faulty clothes horse, rocking back and forth on clapped-out, rusty hinges. There is no \u201cfluidity\u201d to speak of, nothing beautiful nor effortless in my awkward motions.\n\n\u201cGreat for a first go!\u201d Jasz, ever upbeat, issues my first assessment. She gives me extra pointers \u2013 I\u2019m trying to use my legs too much when the movement should be coming from torso and hips \u2013 but tells me the main thing is to keep practising. And so I do. Up and down the small pool, sometimes feeling like I\u2019m slipping into the rolling Ariel motion, other times feeling completely out of my depth despite the shallowness of the water.\n\n\u201cShall we get the tails on?\u201d suggests Jasz. Sure, why not. I quickly find out it\u2019s impossible to inject any elegance into it as I roll around poolside like a young seal pup, yanking up the pink and gold tail she\u2019s given me to practise in. But it\u2019s a different story when we\u2019re back in the water. For one thing, the tail propels me more effortlessly, making the action easier. It\u2019s not that though, to be completely honest \u2013 it\u2019s the sudden realisation that, hey, I\u2019m a bloody mermaid! Before, I was a 32-year-old woman trying to swim with her legs together and cocking it up. Now, I am a lithe sea creature wriggling seductively along the ocean floor. When Jasz suggests taking off the scuba mask and attempting opening my eyes underwater, I don\u2019t even hesitate. I\u2019m ready for this.\n\nI half expect to bring my 20:20 vision to the underwater realm, this now being where I feel most at home: it is, of course, horrendously blurry and chlorinated. Still, Jasz and I strike some poses while her partner films us, and I even try out a smile that more closely resembles a gurn.\n\nOne more glide across the pool and it\u2019s all over \u2013 my time as a merwoman is finished. I\u2019m amazed at how quickly I invested in the whole thing, and how muscles I didn\u2019t even know I had seem to have acquired a deep ache \u2013 the merlife is more physically demanding than it looks. Yet for all that, I reckon Ariel got it wrong when she started hankering after dry land. Flippering free, wish I could be, part of that world\u2026\n\nTravel essentials\n\nSea Life Brighton is offering mermaid dive performances from 24-25 August; tickets from \u00a310.50 when booked online.\n\nTo find a mermaid instructor in your area, visit mermaidsswimuk.co.uk.", "description": "I\u2019m sitting on the side of a training pool, feeling exactly like a beached whale.
