The Federal Reserve meanwhile starts its two-day meeting.\n\nWith a host of U.S. economic data on tap, the ZEW indicator of economic sentiment in Germany rose 21.6 points to a -22.5 reading in September. Economists polled by FactSet had forecast a reading of -37.9.\n\nOf companies in the spotlight, investors soured on Husqvarana's (HUSQ-B.SK) capital markets day, in which the chainsaw and lawn mower maker fell over 5% as it set out targets for sales growth between 4% and 5% on operating margins above 10%. The company's operating margin, adjusted for comparability, was 8.9% over the 12 months ending June.\n\nEuropean e-commerce company Zalando (ZAL.XE) slumped after Swedish investment firm Kinnevik (KINV-B.SK) said it sold a 5.2% stake.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 17, 2019 05:43 ET (09:43 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
