And Trump cannot back down without getting a storm of criticism from the hawks, both Democrats and Republicans.\"", "description": "The US president described the move as a \"good will\" gesture and comes ahead of fresh talks with China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17CCD/production/_108758479_gettyimages-924299406.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
