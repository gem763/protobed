I am doing this due to pressure on MIT and me over a series of misunderstandings and mischaracterizations.\u201d\n\nHe also resigned as president of the Free Software Foundation, an organization that advocates for the development of open source software, according to a statement from the foundation\u2019s executive director. Stallman started the organization in 1985 and had served as its president ever since.\n\nStallman has long been hailed as a pioneering computer scientist, honored with a slew of honorary doctorates and a 1990 MacArthur \u201cGenius Grant.\u201d\n\nIn emails to MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab made public late last week, Stallman defended his fellow well-regarded MIT computer scientist Marvin Minsky, accused of sexually assaulting a woman allegedly trafficked by Epstein, writing that it was likely the victim, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, seemed \u201centirely willing\u201d to Minsky. People within the free software community had whispered to one another for years, but the emails reignited debate about his position within the community.\n\nSelam Jie Gano, the MIT alumna who first published excerpts from Stallman\u2019s emails, told The Daily Beast of Stallman\u2019s resignation: \u201cIt was going to happen eventually. It was obvious that he wasn\u2019t following our community values and guidelines. I hope this motivates a larger conversation.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast reported Friday that Stallman had also advocated for the legalization of child pornography and the abolishment of age of consent laws for more than 15 years on his personal site, stallman.org, the same blog he used to announce his resignation.\n\nStallman argued against age-of-consent laws for more than 15 years on his site. In 2003, he wrote, \u201cI think that everyone age 14 or above ought to take part in sex, though not indiscriminately. (Some people are ready earlier.)\u201d\n\nIn 2006, he wrote that pedophilia might not be so bad: \u201cI am skeptical of the claim that voluntarily [sic] pedophilia harms children. The arguments that it causes harm seem to be based on cases which aren\u2019t voluntary, which are then stretched by parents who are horrified by the idea that their little baby is maturing.\u201d\n\nThe day after The Daily Beast\u2019s story published, he wrote that he had not defended Epstein and that his views on pedophilia had changed: \u201cThrough personal conversations in recent years, I\u2019ve learned to understand how sex with a child can harm per psychologically [sic]. This changed my mind about the matter.\u201d\n\nStallman, the Free Software Foundation, and MIT did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA cascade of Epstein-related scandals have rocked MIT since it was revealed last month that the MIT Media Lab, a research institute within the university whose work often influences the wider tech industry, announced it had accepted a number of donations from Epstein after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The lab\u2019s director, Joi Ito, resigned after The New Yorker reported he had concealed Epstein\u2019s donations from the university and the public and taken more than $1 million for his own personal investments. The president of MIT said he, too, had hidden Epstein\u2019s money and had even signed a thank-you note to the financier.", "description": "Richard Stallman had also advocated for the legalization of child pornography and pedophilia on his personal blog for 15+ years.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2753,w_4896,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568681918/GettyImages-135846490_1_lh0ydk", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
