I just can't believe the White House sent this out'', he said.\n\nDonald Trump's letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been mocked for its simplistic tones\n\n'It is unprecedented to the best of my knowledge, and I do think it makes it tougher to work with Turkey, which is a member of NATO, and we need to figure out a way to get this stopped short of much more violence.'\n\n'Let's work out a good deal!' Trump wrote in the letter. 'You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy\u2014and I will.\n\n'History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen.\n\n'Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!' he added. 'I will call you later.'\n\nThe letter was leaked to Trish Reagan, an evening anchor on the Fox Business Network, with many Twitter users, including White House correspondents, initially believing it to be a hoax.\n\nIn the letter, which was written on October 9 as Erdogan's forces prepared to cross into Syria, Trump urges Turkey's hardman president to 'not be a fool'\n\nSeveral journalists took to the social network on Wednesday to confirm the note was, in fact, legitimate after they were forced to seek confirmation from the White House that the 'embarrassing' letter was real.\n\nKatie Rogers, White House correspondent for the New York Times, said: 'Felt the need to ask WH if this is actually real and it is.'\n\nWashington Post columnist Brian Klaas added: 'Honestly this letter from Trump to Erdogan would make more sense if it were written in crayon on lined practice paper rather than on White House letterhead'.\n\nInternational affairs academic Tom Nichols also took to the social network to brand the letter 'embarrassing beyond words'.\n\nThe letter was leaked to Trish Reagan, an evening anchor on the Fox Business Network, with many Twitter users initially believing it to be a hoax\n\nHe said: 'This is embarrassing beyond words. It suggests the President is mentally unstable. No competent staff would have let this thing leave the building.\n\n'Imagine the letters we haven't seen'.\n\nWajahat Ali added: 'The best/worst part is Trump probably leaked his Erdogan letter to Fox News thinking it made him look strong and smart'.\n\nReports said the letter was passed around at a meeting with congressional leaders on Wednesday, with copies also handed out on the Senate floor.\n\nThe note was not received well by the Turkish president, it was revealed today, who was said to have thrown it in the bin when he received it.\n\nTurkish officials told the BBC that the letter was 'thoroughly rejected' by Erdogan, who promptly placed it in the bin and considered it 'the final straw'.\n\nMark Lowen, the BBC's Turkey correspondent tweeted today: 'When President Erdogan received Trump's letter, he 'thoroughly rejected it, threw it in the bin' and launched the Syria operation the same day. His mind was already made up to move in; letter was reportedly the final straw.'\n\nThe note was also not received well by the Turkish president, who was said to have thrown it in the bin when he received it\n\nThese reports have thrown into question hopes that Mike Pence will be able to convince Turkey to halt its offensive against Kurdish fighters in northeast Syria when he meets with Erdogan today amid a deepening humanitarian crisis.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he hadn't given Erdogan 'a green light' to invade Syria. He also claimed releasing 'a very powerful letter' would dispel misconceptions about the impact of his troop withdrawal days before he wrote the note.\n\n'If anybody saw the letter, which can be released very easily if you'd like \u2013 I could certainly release it,' he said.\n\n'But I wrote a letter right after that conversation \u2013 a very powerful letter. There was never given a green light.'", "description": "In the letter, which was written on October 9 as\u00a0Erdogan's forces prepared to cross into Syria, Trump urges Turkey's hardman president to 'not be a fool'.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/14/19807762-0-image-a-53_1571319728958.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
