Nothing to worry about, Fed's George says", "language": "en", "text": "DENVER (Reuters) - Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George on Sunday rejected the notion that the U.S. central bank should cut interest rates to try to boost low inflation, which she said is largely a result of global forces that U.S. monetary policy can do little to counter.\n\nKansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George addresses the National Association for Business Economics in Denver, Colorado, U.S. October 6, 2019. REUTERS/Ann Saphir\n\n\u201cIn current circumstances, concern about low inflation seems unnecessary,\u201d George told the National Association for Business Economics in Denver. \u201cThe U.S. economy is currently in a good place, with low inflation, low unemployment and an outlook for continued moderate growth.\u201d\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly described the economy as being \u201cin a good place,\u201d but unlike George has supported reductions to U.S. interest rates as an insurance policy against the effects of slowing global growth and rising trade uncertainty as the U.S. ramps up tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nGeorge, by contrast, dissented on both of the Fed\u2019s interest rate cuts this year, in July and September. The Fed currently targets short-term interest rates in a range of 1.75% to 2.00%, a setting that by most Fed policymaker estimates should help boost growth.\n\n\u201cIf I saw the consumer losing their confidence, and that could happen, then I might rethink,\u201d George told the group, adding that for the most part, consumer spending has been strong. \u201cI think about this latest round of tariffs that will largely hit the consumer, and to what extent that might cause a reaction.\u201d\n\nBut unless there is a broader economic impact, \u201cmuted inflation alone would not warrant a policy response,\u201d she said.\n\nIn fact, she suggested, inflation could sink to well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target and she might remain unfazed.\n\n\u201cI find it more realistic to accept that there will be both temporary and persistent fluctuations around this long-run target and, as long as they don\u2019t exceed a reasonable threshold \u2014 perhaps as big as 50 or even 100 basis points \u2014 they should be tolerated, depending on broader economic conditions,\u201d she said.\n\nThat view is at odds with concern expressed by much of the Fed leadership over years of missing the central bank\u2019s 2% inflation goal.\n\nThe Fed, which next meets Oct. 29-30, is widely expected to lower rates at least once more this year. George said that while each meeting is a chance to rethink her stance, she made it clear that she is not committed to that plan.\n\n\u201cShould incoming data point to a broadly weaker economy, adjusting policy may be appropriate to achieve the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandates for maximum sustainable employment and stable prices,\u201d George said. But \u201ctrying to quickly return inflation to 2 percent by adjusting interest rates could require aggressive actions that would misallocate resources and create financial imbalances.\u201d", "description": "Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George on Sunday rejected the notion that the U.S. central bank should cut interest rates to try to boost low inflation, which she said is largely a result of global forces that U.S. monetary policy can do little to counter.", "authors": ["Ann Saphir", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437906451&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9602U", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
