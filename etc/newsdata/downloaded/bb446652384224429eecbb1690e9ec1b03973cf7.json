It helps you see how you add up in the big picture.\n\nTalking to someone in your field can actually amplify your imposter syndrome \u2014 probably because you're comparing yourself to them.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nJust in case you somehow forgot how important STEM is, a new scientific study has determined the best way to cure imposter syndrome.\n\nImposter syndrome \u2014 the worry that you don't deserve your success and will be discovered as an imposter \u2014 reportedly affects 70% of the population. According to research done at Brigham Young University and published in the Journal of Vocational Behavior, the most effective way to battle imposter syndrome is to seek support from someone outside of your field or, really, someone you don't know in a professional setting at all.\n\nResearchers say seeking support from a friend or family member helped their subjects see their abilities in the big picture.\n\n\"After reaching outside their social group for support, students are able to understand themselves more holistically rather than being so focused on what they felt they lacked in just one area,\" Jeff Bednar, assistant professor of organizational behavior and human resources at Brigham Young University, said in a press release.\n\nOn the flip side, the study found that speaking to someone in your field amplifies feelings of imposter syndrome, probably due to an increased likelihood to draw comparisons between your abilities and theirs.\n\nWhile the study was conducted on college students, the authors say it can be applied to the workplace, too. They used it to make suggestions for organizations on how to cut down on imposter syndrome and increase morale and productivity.\n\n\"It's important to create cultures where people talk about failure and mistakes,\" Bednar said in a press release. \"When we create those cultures, someone who is feeling strong feelings of impostor-ism will be more likely to get the help they need within the organization.\"", "description": "Talking to someone else in your industry could actually amplify your imposter syndrome.
