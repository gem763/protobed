Yesterday, she was wearing Chun-Li\u2019s signature blue qipao and bun covers, and soon after, she received notice of a three-day suspension for \u201csexually suggestive content or activities,\u201d according to an email from Twitch posted to her Twitter. The outfit features a thigh-high slit that is sometimes considered risqu\u00e9.\n\n\u201cI actually bought one size up to ensure that the slit wasn\u2019t too high,\u201d said Quqco in an email to Kotaku. \u201cThe slit of this dress is cut lower than some runner shorts I own.\u201d\n\nTwitch\u2019s guidelines surrounding sexually explicit content are vague, a widespread allegation waged by female streamers for years. \u201cAttire intended to be sexually suggestive and nudity are prohibited,\u201d Twitch\u2019s community guidelines read. For streams like Quqco\u2019s, they \u201crecommend attire appropriate for public settings, such as what you would wear on a public street, or to a mall or restaurant.\u201d\n\nThe video in question has since been removed, so it\u2019s difficult to tell if there was a particular moment that may have been flagged by Twitch. Twitch did not respond to Kotaku\u2019s request for comment by the time of publication.\n\nTwitch previously suspended Quqco after she cosplayed Mai Shiranui from The King of Fighters. At the time, Quqco wrote on Twitter that she was banned because she was report brigaded by the popular subreddit Livestreamfail. \u201cI was sexually harassed,\u201d she wrote in a now-deleted tweet.\n\n\u201cAll I wore was a Mai cosplay while I was drawing.\u201d Quqco believes this recent suspension was also due to \u201ca group of trolls who have been targeting me for mass reporting for a while...I am immediately reported because I\u2019ve been branded a thot,\u201d she said, adding that she doesn\u2019t do physical activities like squatting or dancing on stream.\n\nKotaku saw one now-removed comment on Livestreamfail in which a user said, \u201cLmao saw her streaming again today and instantly reported the thot,\u201d although we were unable to confirm whether she was brigaded. Brigading is not an uncommon problem for female streamers; Kotaku has previously reported on self-appointed boob police who trawl through Twitch\u2019s directories searching for and reporting women they believe are violating Twitch\u2019s terms of service.\n\nDespite this, the moderators of Livestreamfail don\u2019t believe the suspension is connected to the subreddit\u2019s activity. \u201cConsidering the thread was submitted after her ban by Twitch it\u2019s pretty hard to argue that it\u2019s the result of a LSF brigade,\u201d one told Kotaku.\n\n\u201cI am sure there are other girls who are facing the same difficulty as me,\u201d said Quqco. \u201cThe problem is that there are so many trolls and ill-tended people who will band together to report a streamer.\u201d", "description": "Last night, Twitch suspended art streamer Quqco after she livestreamed herself wearing cosplay of Chun-Li from Street Fighter, Dexerto first reported....", "authors": ["Joshua Rivera", "Keza Macdonald"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ega1ya6zaisznlgzbu4o.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
