(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nA look at the good (Hail!) and bad (Fail!) from the Redskins\u2019 31-15 loss to the Bears on Monday.\n\nHail: Alex Smith\n\nBefore the game, Redskins quarterback Alex Smith walked without assistance on the FedEx Field turf alongside his wife, Elizabeth. Given that Smith was seen as recently as August hopping around training camp on crutches and had a bulky external fixator on his right leg to stabilize his surgically repaired tibia and fibula, this seemed like a promising development. The 35-year-old Smith, who hasn\u2019t given up on the idea of playing again, was accompanied by an ESPN camera crew as he stood near the place on the field where he suffered his gruesome injury in Week 10 of last season. The ensuing 60 minutes of game action would remind the Redskins just how much they miss him.\n\nIt\u2019s great to see Alex Smith out here walking at FedEx Field. Still has a noticeable limp but it\u2019s certainly progress. pic.twitter.com/n4CWRWv9Fb \u2014 Adam Hoge (@AdamHoge) September 23, 2019\n\nFail: Case Keenum\n\nKeenum was solid, if unspectacular, in the Redskins\u2019 first two games, with a Smith-like five touchdowns against zero interceptions. The veteran is no longer perfect in the turnover department after committing a ghastly five against the Bears. Keenum\u2019s brutal night featured three interceptions, including an errant pass on Washington\u2019s first possession that was picked off by Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and returned for a touchdown. Keenum also lost a pair of fumbles, including one on a bizarre play in the fourth quarter that squashed the Redskins\u2019 hopes of a comeback. On fourth-and-one from deep in Chicago territory, Keenum kept the ball on a quarterback sneak. Rather than plow straight ahead, Keenum leaped and extended the ball over the mass of linemen in front of him, which would\u2019ve been a fine idea had the Redskins been at the goal line. They were not. Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan knocked the ball loose and Eddie Jackson recovered for Chicago.\n\nHail: London Fletcher\n\nThe middle linebacker, who spent the final seven years of his career in Washington, was inducted into the team\u2019s Ring of Honor at halftime. One of the greatest free agent acquisitions in D.C. sports history, Fletcher was a team captain who started 112 consecutive regular season games and made four Pro Bowls with the Redskins.\n\nFail: London Flecther\n\nAs if it wasn\u2019t already bad enough that the Redskins\u2019 defense allowed 30 points in a third straight game for the first time since 2013, Fletcher\u2019s final year in the league, the team couldn\u2019t bother to spell his name correctly in a graphic on the scoreboard. (Thankfully, the permanent plaque honoring Fletcher inside the stadium did not feature the same mistake.) This deserves to be featured on ESPN\u2019s \u201cC\u2019mon, Man!\u201d segment during next Monday\u2019s pregame show.\n\nWhat a classy organization. @Redskins can\u2019t even spell their new ring of honor member, London Fletcher\u2019s name right. What a joke starting from the top, Dan Snyder #Redskins #HTTR pic.twitter.com/37yLwfKtFX \u2014 The Opening Drive (@OpeningDrive) September 24, 2019\n\nHail: Terry McLaurin\n\nTwo things you can count on: McLaurin earning praise in \u201cHail or Fail\u201d and the Redskins stinking up the joint on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d More on the latter in a minute. McLaurin had six catches for 70 yards and a touchdown, making him the first player in NFL history with at least five catches and a touchdown in each of his first three games. The third-round draft pick out of Ohio State is also the first Redskins rookie wide receiver with three touchdowns in his first three games since Charlie Brown in 1982. Brown finished with eight touchdowns that season. McLaurin\u2019s third-quarter touchdown against the Bears cut the Chicago lead to 28-9 and was his most impressive yet, as it came with cornerback Buster Skrine in tight coverage.\n\nFail: The Redskins on Mondays\n\nThe Redskins always manage to find a way to avoid appearing on HBO\u2019s \u201cHard Knocks.\u201d When are they going to figure out how to dodge Monday night games? Can\u2019t they just decline the invitation? It would be for the best, for everyone but Washington\u2019s opponent. Monday\u2019s loss was the Redskins\u2019 eighth straight on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d since their upset win over the Cowboys in 2014. Washington is 2-17 at home on Monday night since FedEx Field opened in 1997 and 2-16 in their past 18 appearances on Monday night dating back to 2008. Keenum fell to 0-4 on Monday. As is often the case when Washington is playing at home in prime time, Monday\u2019s game was ugly early, with the Bears building a 28-0 lead in the first half. The home team has now trailed by at least 19 points at halftime of \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d six times since 2009. The Redskins are responsible for four of those instances.\n\nThe NFL should never put the Redskins on Monday night football again. \u2014 Mike Jones (@ByMikeJones) September 24, 2019\n\nThe @Redskins have now lost 7 straight home games on Monday Night Football, the second-longest streak in MNF history.\n\n\n\nWashington also owns the longest streak, having lost 10 straight home MNF games between 1998-2010. They are 1-17 in their last 18 home games on MNF. pic.twitter.com/26u7YwNP5W \u2014 ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) September 24, 2019\n\nHail: Jonathan Allen\n\nRedskins defensive lineman Jonathan Allen returned to the lineup after missing last week\u2019s loss with a knee injury, and while he wasn\u2019t happy with the result, he told reporters afterward that it\u2019s \u201cnot time to jump off ship.\u201d After all, no team is eliminated from playoff contention after three weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be the best athletes in the world,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the mental toughness to stay focused after three weeks in a 17-week regular season, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Each guy has to be held accountable and just take it from there. There ain\u2019t no magic sauce to get this thing turned around. It\u2019s doing the little things right. \u2026 If you don\u2019t support us now, don\u2019t support us later. We\u2019re going to circle the wagons in this mother f----- and we\u2019re going to get s--- right. Believe that.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve got to admire the confidence.\n\nFail: Washington\u2019s Gatorade Stirring Method\n\nESPN\u2019s cameras caught a Redskins employee on the Washington sideline stirring a cooler of Gatorade with an unopened sleeve of plastic-wrapped Gatorade cups during Monday\u2019s game. It was strangely mesmerizing. The guy deserves points for creativity and credit for not using his bare arm to stir the not magic sauce that fuels the Redskins, but someone please get him a spoon before next week\u2019s game. If you\u2019re feeling generous, this one\u2019s on sale.\n\nThis is one of the most astonishing things I've ever seen pic.twitter.com/O8yUVcoYke \u2014 Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) September 24, 2019\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nAt 0-3, it\u2019s time to ask: What is this Redskins season even about?\n\nThree takeaways from Redskins\u2019 loss to the Bears\n\nRedskins fall into four-touchdown hole, lose to Bears, 31-15\n\nKey moments from Redskins\u2019 31-15 loss to the Bears on \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019\n\nBooger McFarland on Redskins\u2019 defense, \u2018iconic\u2019 FedEx Field and Bruce Allen", "description": "Washington\u2019s eighth straight loss on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d featured mistakes on and off the field.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
