Regulators were circling, storefronts were vanishing and investors were abandoning the industry\u2019s biggest companies en masse.\n\nAnd yet today, just a few years later, many of the same subprime lenders that specialized in the debt are promoting an almost equally onerous type of credit.\n\nIt\u2019s called the online installment loan, a form of debt with much longer maturities but often the same sort of crippling, triple-digit interest rates. If the payday loan\u2019s target audience is the nation\u2019s poor, then the installment loan is geared to all those working-class Americans who have seen their wages stagnate and unpaid bills pile up in the years since the Great Recession.\n\nIn just a span of five years, online installment loans have gone from being a relatively niche offering to a red-hot industry. Subprime borrowers now collectively owe about $50 billion on installment products, according to credit reporting firm TransUnion. In the process, they\u2019re helping transform the way that a large swathe of the country accesses debt. And they have done so without attracting the kind of public and regulatory backlash that hounded the payday loan.\n\n\u201cInstallment loans are a cash cow for creditors, but a devastating cost to borrowers,\u201d said Margot Saunders, senior counsel for the National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nSubprime Evolution\n\nFor many families struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages, it\u2019s a cost they\u2019re increasingly willing to bear.\n\nIn the decade through 2018, average household incomes for those with a high school diploma have risen about 15%, to roughly $46,000, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau data available.\n\nNot only is that less than the 20% increase registered on a broad basket of goods over the span, but key costs that play an outsize role in middle-class budgets have increased much more: home prices are up 26%, medical care 33%, and college costs a whopping 45%.\n\nTo keep up, Americans borrowed. A lot. Unsecured personal loans, as well as mortgage, auto, credit-card and student debt have all steadily climbed over the span.\n\nFor many payday lenders staring at encroaching regulatory restrictions and accusations of predatory lending, the working class\u2019s growing need for credit was an opportunity to reinvent themselves.\n\nThey \u201csaw the writing on the wall, and figured, \u2018let\u2019s anticipate this and figure out how to stay in business,\u2019\u201d said Lisa Servon, a University of Pennsylvania professor specializing in urban poverty and author of The Unbanking of America: How the New Middle Class Survives.\n\nTriple-Digit Rates\n\nEnter the online installment loan, aimed in part at a fast expanding group of \u2018near-prime\u2019 borrowers -- those with bad, but not terrible, credit -- with limited access to traditional banking options.\n\nRanging anywhere from $100 to $10,000 or more, they quickly became so popular that many alternative credit providers soon began generating the bulk of their revenue from installment rather than payday loans.\n\nYet the shift came with a major consequence for borrowers. By changing how customers repaid their debts, subprime lenders were able to partly circumvent growing regulatory efforts intended to prevent families from falling into debt traps built on exorbitant fees and endless renewals.\n\nWhereas payday loans are typically paid back in one lump sum and in a matter of weeks, terms on installment loans can range anywhere from 4 to 60 months, ostensibly allowing borrowers to take on larger amounts of personal debt.\n\nIn states such as California and Virginia, interest-rate caps enacted years ago and meant to protect payday borrowers only applied to loans below $2,500.\n\nFor subprime lender Enova International Inc., outstanding installment loans averaged $2,123 in the second quarter, versus $420 for short-term products, according to a recent regulatory filing.\n\nLarger loans have allowed many installment lenders to charge interest rates well in the triple digits. In many states, Enova\u2019s NetCredit platform offers annual percentage rates between 34% and 155%.\n\nIn fact, Virginia sued NetCredit last year for avoiding state interest-rate caps, while California Governor Gavin Newsom earlier this month signed into law a measure capping interest rates on loans between $2,500 and $10,000 at 36% plus the Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark, currently at around 2%.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
