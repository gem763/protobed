Mane is expected to be back in training on Thursday.\n\nOdds\n\nLiverpool are the favourites for tonight\u2019s match, after recording a 15th consecutive league win when they beat Chelsea on Sunday. Jurgen Klopp\u2019s men are favourites at 2/11 (1.18).\n\nFans of MK Dons will be hoping to see a similar result tonight as they did five years ago, when the side triumphed over Manchester United with a 4-0 victory. A shock victory is not expected however with odds of 14/1 (15.00).\n\nFor a draw you can get odds of 13/2 (7.50).\n\nPrediction\n\nAlthough the teams have never met, MK Dons have surprised in previous Carabao Cup ties \u2013 such as with their 4-0 victory over Manchester City in 2014. But with Liverpool\u2019s winning streak up to 15 matches and MK Dons coming off the back of two 1-0 home defeats, a shock win is looking unlikely for the Milton Keynes-based side.\n\nDespite Klopp being expected to play a weakened side, Liverpool will triumph in tonight\u2019s meeting. The match may not be as easy as expected though, with MK Dons using the match as an opportunity to prove themselves. Nonetheless, we\u2019re going for a victory for Liverpool.", "description": "Tonight\u2019s Carabao Cup match will see Liverpool\u00a0travel to Milton Keynes to face MK Dons.
