The Motley Fool\n\nEvery small business owner wants to know how to increase sales, improve their marketing and motivate their employees. But first, let\u2019s make sure we keep your company safe \u2013 your data, your money, your physical premises. Having survived in business for over 25 years, I\u2019ve picked up a few tricks along the way and learned a hard lesson or two as well.\n\nHere are eight simple steps you can take to increase your company\u2019s security:\n\nGo to the cloud\n\nIn 2012, I got rid of my company\u2019s server, moving virtually all our data to online services. While you may fear being hacked if you store this stuff online, the reality is you\u2019re far more vulnerable keeping your data and accounts on your premises. Your physically based server (not to mention your computers, laptops, and phones) can be compromised by damage or theft. Sure, you may plan to back up online regularly, but do you actually do it? After disasters \u2013 such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes \u2013 one of the greatest problems facing small businesses is they\u2019re not able to access their accounts. That makes both getting back to work and receiving disaster recovery funds more difficult than if you\u2019ve got your data in the cloud.\n\nBe the administrator\n\nI have learned the hard way that for ALL online services and for my company\u2019s website, I \u2013 and only I \u2013 must be listed as the administrator. Sure, you trust your IT person, website designer, or your tech-savvy nephew, but things happen. If you\u2019re not the administrator, one disgruntled techie can hold you \u2013 and your data \u2013 hostage. You don\u2019t have to be a technological genius to be the administrator. Every small business owner should be listed as the administrator of every one of their online services and sites.\n\nMake sure your small business has a robust digital presence.

The comptroller set up phony businesses that billed the company relatively small amounts for years. The owner trusted this comptroller completely and neglected to examine the accounts payable closely. Know what \u2013 and who \u2013 you\u2019re paying for.\n\nMore: Some small-business owners have toxic bosses to thank for their independence\n\nMore: Latina entrepreneurs are leading a movement to make traditional Hispanic food healthier\n\nMore: Remembering the small business casualties of 9/11 \u2013 including mine\n\nCheck your deposits\n\nYears ago, my accountant told me to never have the same person who opened the checks also deposit the checks. Why? Those payments might not actually end up in my account. We still get paid primarily by checks from our customers (mostly large institutions), and I check on every check. Of course, it\u2019s harder for employees to steal deposits when you instead get paid by credit card or electronic funds transfers (see next point).\n\nLimit cash\n\nSure you hate paying those fees when you accept credit cards instead of getting cash, but a cash-rich business is a target in many ways. First, you are more likely to be the subject of a robbery \u2013 thieves are far more interested in cash than credit card receipts. Next, it\u2019s more tempting for some of your own employees will steal from you if there\u2019s lots of cash on the premises. This doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t accept cash, but make it easy for customers to pay you in cashless ways.\n\nChange your key\n\nWhen was the last time you changed the keys to your office, warehouse, or plant? You\u2019ve probably had dozens of employees who\u2019ve had those keys over the years. Change your keys regularly.\n\nChange and guard your passwords\n\nStill using your birthday or your dog\u2019s name for your password? Cut that out. You need different \u2013 and tough \u2013 passwords for each site you use. Of course, that\u2019s awkward and tough to remember. Consider using a password manager, like LastPass or 1password. Store your password(s) in a locked safe. And whenever possible, and for all your financial and critical sites, use two-factor authentication, requiring you to also respond to a text or an email when you want access.\n\nBe honest\n\nIf you are a dishonest businessperson \u2013 if you cheat your customers, lie to your vendors, pay workers under the table or get paid under the table \u2013 your employees are going to be far more likely to be dishonest too. As the business owner, you set the tone, you demonstrate what behavior is acceptable. If you are the kind of person who cheats others, don\u2019t be surprised if others cheat you.\n\nRhonda Abrams is the author of \u201cSuccessful Business Plan: Secrets & Strategies,\u201d the best-selling business plan guide of all time, just released in its seventh edition.
