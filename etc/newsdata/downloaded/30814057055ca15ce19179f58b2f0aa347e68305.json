He ended up climbing down a manhole himself to find the phone.\n\n\u201c[The manhole] wasn\u2019t even six feet deep. In the photo, I was standing on a concrete floor on bottom and the hole to the side was so small, not even my yorkie poo would have fit through. There was no perceived danger. It all just happened in the moment,\u201d Ratliff said.\n\nHall was grateful for the return of her device.\n\n\u201cI was so thankful I freaking hugged him,\u201d Hall said. \u201cNot only did he slice his finger and was filthy from laying on the ground and climbing in the hole, I find out he had actually just gotten off shift and was still willing to help me.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 A Chick-fil-A customer who dropped her phone down a storm drain outside the Virginia eatery thanked a dedicated employee who climbed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
