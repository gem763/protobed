Think again", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s time to think about reducing along with recycling\n\nIf you\u2019re like most Canadian kids, you sort your garbage and put plastic in the recycling.\n\nAnd you feel good knowing you\u2019re doing something positive for the planet.\n\nBut it may surprise you to know that only nine per cent of all the plastic we use in Canada actually gets recycled.\n\nCBC\u2019s Marketplace recently did an investigation into this to find out where exactly that plastic was going and what was happening to it.\n\nTurns out a lot of it is being shipped overseas to countries like Malaysia.\n\n\u201cWe found shipping containers full at ports,\u201d said Marketplace reporter David Common. \u201cWe went to big, giant, like multi-storey mountains that are just filled with plastic, a lot of it from North America.\u201d\n\nCBC Marketplace reporter David Common found piles of plastic that had been shipped from overseas in Malaysia. (Eric Szeto/CBC)\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nCommon said it\u2019s because Canada doesn\u2019t have the capacity to recycle all the plastic we use.\n\n\u201cIf you have a water bottle, you don't want it to cost more than the cost of a water bottle to recycle it [so] you send it to a place like Malaysia,\u201d he said.\n\nBut shipping it overseas doesn\u2019t guarantee it\u2019s going to get recycled either.\n\nCommon found plastic piling up in mountains, plastic being burned and plastic floating down rivers.\n\nPlastic is contaminating rivers in Malaysia. (Eric Szeto/CBC)\n\n\u201cIt costs more to recycle it sometimes than the product is worth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so those recyclers will take the most valuable parts, they'll reprocess that. Anything else they burn.\u201d\n\nThat creates huge clouds of smoke that are damaging to people\u2019s health.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution?\n\nCommon said we shouldn\u2019t stop recycling, but we should also find ways to use less plastic in the first place.\n\nYou can do that by using things like reusable water bottles and reusable bags.\n\nDavid Common tells Saara Chaudry that it\u2019s important to recycle, but also to reduce waste. (CBC)\n\nBut part of the nine per cent figure mentioned above also applies to plastic that you don\u2019t even think to put in your blue bin \u2014 like packaging from things you buy regularly.\n\nSo it\u2019s also important to try to buy products that use less plastic in the first place.\n\n\u201cDoes this package need to have that much plastic? Do I need to buy it?\u201d Common asked.\n\nHe said those are things to think about when trying to reduce plastic.\n\nTo learn more about the plastic found in Malaysia, check out this video:", "description": "CBC Kids News contributor Saara Chaudy learns why our plastic is ending up in Malaysia and the problems that creates for the environment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/MarketplacePlastics_thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
