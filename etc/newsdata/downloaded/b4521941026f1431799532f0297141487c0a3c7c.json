I understand the NBA. The players and the owners both got billions of dollars at stake.\u201d\n\nAt issue is Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s recent \u201cFight for Freedom\u201d tweet regarding protests in Hong Kong, which prompted an apology from the league.\n\nPlayers and coaches who have been open about their political activism for years have refused to comment on the matter.\n\n\u201cYou know, I think it\u2019s really funny,\u201d Mr. Barkley said. \u201cAll these idiots and jackasses and fools on radio and television telling these players to [speak up]. There are the same people who\u2019ve been hating on [former NFL player] Colin Kaepernick [and his national anthem protests] for the last three years. \u2026 You all want to control what happens in a foreign country? Give me a break.\u201d\n\nThe NBA released a statement on Monday saying Mr. Morey\u2019s commentary on Hong Kong \u201cdoes not represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\u201d NBA Chief Communications Officer Mike Bass said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
