The authors of the study revealed that they wish to make the land sector carbon neutral by 2040.\n\nAccording to Stephanie Roe, an environmental scientist at the University of Virginia, who is also the lead author of the study, stated in a conversation with AFP, \"We developed a roadmap that cuts land sector emissions by about 50 percent per decade, and increases the carbon sequestered in land about ten-fold between 2030-2050.\"\n\nShe, along with her team looked at climate models that could help to curb land-based emissions and found over two-dozen land-management practices that could not only reduce emission but also provide other benefits.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThey discovered that deforestation in places like Brazil, Indonesia and Africa's Congo Basin needs to be toned down 70 percent by 2030 to reduce global warming. Nations need to improve the health of the forest by planting trees on croplands to capture and store annual emissions similar to the European Union' total annual emissions every year by 2030.\n\nWastage of food should also be slashed by 30 percent. Total emissions from land must come down 85 percent, while also increasing the amount of carbon stored on land 10-fold by 2050.", "description": "An international team of scientists reveal that a third of the emission cuts could be avoided if better management of world farms and forests can be implemented.
