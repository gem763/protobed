This is what the EU originally proposed.\n\nBrexit Irony When Theresa May first started negotiating Brexit, Michel Barnier, the EU's negotiator, suggested a Northern Ireland Backstop. Theresa May had to reject that idea because she needed 9 DUP MPs to hold her fragile coalition together. Brexit Basics BBC Brexit Basics shows a NI solution is what the EU originally proposed. A Northern Ireland only backstop? This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. Idea Revived Boris Johnson revived the idea, somehow getting DUP on board, but now the EU seems united against its own idea. Barnier Objects I updated @Europarl_EN & EU27 on #UK\u2019s proposals. EU wants a Withdrawal Agreement w/ workable and effective solutions that create legal and practical certainty now. We owe this to peace & stability on the island of Ireland. We must protect consumers & businesses in the EU market. \u2014 Michel Barnier (@MichelBarnier) October 3, 2019\n\nBrexit latest: Michel Barnier has told EU27 ambassadors it is \"difficult\" to see a deal emerging in the next ten days unless the British \u201cfundamentally amend their position\u201d.\n\n1. \u2014 Jennifer Rankin (@JenniferMerode) October 3, 2019\n\nEuropean Commission Objects\n\n.@EU_Commission on #Brexit: \"@JunckerEU welcomed the positive advances in the UK\u2019s text but also noted problematic points on which further work is needed by UK.

This is from the DUP leader Arlene Foster, commenting on what Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy premier and foreign minister, said earlier about the Brexit deal being unacceptable in its current form.\n\n\"The Irish government\u2019s preparedness to dump the consent principle for their country\u2019s expediency is foolish in the extreme and sends a very clear message to unionists.\"\n\nDonald Tusk, European Council President\n\nToday I had two phone calls on #Brexit, first with Dublin then with London.\n\nMy message to Taoiseach @LeoVaradkar: We stand fully behind Ireland.\n\nMy message to PM @BorisJohnson: We remain open but still unconvinced. \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 3, 2019\n\nTusk is \"Open but Unconvinced\".\n\nWhat's Going On?\n\nBluff by Ireland? Bluff by EU? Irish Intransigence? EU Intransigence? All of the Above?\n\nNote the one missing ingredient: UK Intransigence.\n\nDespite appearances, I do not think it is number 4. My guess is 1, 2, and possibly 3.\n\nOdds of Deal\n\nYesterday, I noted On the Verge of a Brexit Breakthrough.\n\nI see no reason to change that view.\n\nThe important point is not the seemingly major disagreements but rather the fact there are are major negotiations underway.\n\nA bluff by Ireland and the EU are highly likely. The alternative is Irish Intransigence, EU Intransigence, or both.\n\nI rule out EU Intransigence on the grounds that the EU will go along if Ireland does.\n\nKey Point\n\nDUP: \u201cThe flippant Dublin reaction to the Prime Minister\u2019s proposals has also exposed the reality that the Irish government would never have consented to the United Kingdom leaving the backstop if it had been implemented.\u201d \u2014 Harry Cole (@MrHarryCole) October 3, 2019\n\n\u201cThe flippant Dublin reaction to the Prime Minister\u2019s proposals has also exposed the reality that the Irish government would never have consented to the United Kingdom leaving the backstop if it had been implemented.\u201d\n\nAdmitting the Trap\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that the Irish Govt are not interested in having an alternative to the Backstop and it actually exposes the fact that the Backstop was a trap. They had never any intention of allowing us to leave the Backstop and that\u2019s what has been shown today\u201d @DUPleader pic.twitter.com/d4SI20lxR2 \u2014 #StandUp4Brexit (@StandUp4Brexit) October 3, 2019\n\nMajority in UK Parliament on Board\n\nBoris Johnson has achieved something everyone thought impossible:\n\nA Majority!\n\nDUP is on board\n\nRebel Labour MPs on board\n\nHard Brexiters on board\n\nMost Tories on board\n\nAll Aboard\n\nSteve Baker, the chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, and one of the 28 \u201cSpartans\u201d who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal on every occasion, tells Johnson: \u201cWe now glimpse the possibility of a tolerable deal.\u201d Johnson says he welcomes that coming from Baker, although he says the two have spoken regularly in recent days, and so, he implies, he is not surprised to have Baker\u2019s support.\n\nThat's pretty amazing actually. And note this.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s chief constable, Simon Byrne, has said that his officers will not staff any form of border security after Brexit. At a meeting of the Northern Ireland Policing Board earlier, Byrne said he had \u201cmade it clear\u201d to the Northern Ireland Office that police would not \u201cstaff any form of border security\u201d after the UK leaves the EU.\n\nIf Ireland or the EU sink this deal, the most likely consequence is No Deal.\n\nPolls show that Johnson will clobber Jeremy Corbyn in an election. Heck, the Liberal Democrats might even become the opposition leader.\n\nThe EU has to understand this.\n\nExcellent Eleven-Tweet Chain on a Landing Zone\n\nBoris Johnson is right to call his proposal a \u201cbroad landing zone in which \u2026 a deal can begin to take shape.\u201d As such, it is politically astute. If you accept the premise that the UK is leaving the EU single market and customs union, the proposal is also logical. 1/ \u2014 Andrew Duff (@AndrewDuffEU) October 2, 2019\n\nConclusion: \"The goal is a decent UK-EU working partnership with peace and legitimacy for Ireland, North and South.\"\n\nDuff adds in a second Tweet, \"Johnson is frank about turning away from May\u2019s agreement. In these circs, what works for Ireland that is better than no deal ?\"\n\nMay's Deal\n\nIt is clear that May's deal was better for the EU than Johnson's deal. But it can't pass.\n\nThe choice will be between Johnson's deal (assuming he can work one out) or no deal.\n\nFor political purposes, the Tories and the Liberal Democrats want elections. For political reasons the EU does not want the UK having a say in EU policies and procedures.\n\nExcellent Speech by Johnson\n\nHand Exposed\n\nThe hand of the those allegedly wanting to stop No Deal is exposed.\n\nNo majority for a referendum.\n\nNo majority for elections\n\nNo majority for a caretaker government\n\nNo majority for Remain\n\nLabour, the Lib Dems, and SNP say their top priority is to stop No Deal and they are against Johnson doing just that!", "description": "Boris Johnson Proposes a Northern Ireland solution.
