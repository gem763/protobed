Hunter made similarly sketchy deals with China.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s phone call this summer with his Ukrainian counterpart may have been ill-advised, but it simply didn\u2019t rise to an impeachable offense. Meanwhile, the American people deserve to know the truth about the Biden family\u2019s lucrative dealings with other countries during the Obama \u00adadministration.\n\nIndeed, in 2016, Biden oversaw a seriously salacious project in Ukraine that included attempting to get the nation to fire its top prosecutor. One of his tactics included clearly and explicitly threatening to withhold at least $1 billion in American aid if the Ukrainians didn\u2019t follow through with the Obama administration\u2019s demands. Soon \u00adafter this tangible threat, the prosecutor was fired.\n\nBiden later bragged: \u201cI looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhat much of the mainstream media seems to ignore is that, while the prosecutor may have been a shady character, he was in the process of investigating Burisma Holdings, the largest gas company in Ukraine. Burisma just happened to be paying Hunter that eye-watering salary as a board member.\n\nConveniently, Burisma awarded this cushy post to Hunter Biden weeks after the Obama administration announced that his father would be its point man in Ukraine. Other than his last name and connection to his old man, what, exactly, did Hunter offer Burisma? And even if firing the Ukrainian prosecutor was warranted, how did the appearance of impropriety and conflict of interest escape Joe Biden?\n\nThe media would like to obfuscate this \u00adawful fact pattern by focusing solely on Trump\u2019s call, which included no explicit quid pro quo and which ultimately left unaffected the state of US aid to Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, liberal mainstream outlets are all but wholly ignoring many facts that had already been reported about Hunter Biden in the weeks and even months before Trump\u2019s phone call became public.\n\nA former senior Obama White House aide told The New Yorker in July that \u201cHunter was on the loose, potentially undermining his father\u2019s message.\u201d The staffer went so far as to suggest that Hunter Biden did not fully comprehend that many of his foreign business partners were only motivated to work with him because they wanted to say \u201cthat they are affiliated with Biden.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration was supposed to be ultra-scrupulous, remember? As this same aide argued, even \u201cthe appearance of a conflict of interest is good enough, at this level of politics, to keep you from doing things like that.\u201d Yet Hunter Biden continued, unencumbered, to cavort with his international business partners and get paid handsomely for it.\n\nAll told, it has been reported, Hunter \u00adBiden made upwards of $3 million doing consulting work in industries and countries with which he had no experience.\n\nSurely smart Democrats understand how badly all this could damage his father\u2019s presidential aspirations. President Trump will likely frame the entire 2020 campaign as the story of the Biden family\u2019s oily foreign connections. Judged against Hunter Biden\u2019s \u00adunseemly, nepotistic wheeling and dealing, his father\u2019s uplifting campaign slogans can only ring hollow.\n\nTrump could even marshal the words of Viktor Shokin, the fired Ukrainian prosecutor, who testified under oath that \u201cI was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings, a natural gas firm active in Ukraine, and Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden was a member of the board of directors.\u201d\n\nBiden, in other words, represents a massive liability for the Democrats in 2020. Already, he is slipping in the polls behind the radical Sen. Liz Warren. If Democrats are to have a reasonable shot at choosing an electable moderate as their nominee, Biden must step aside to make room for someone who isn\u2019t nearly as tainted by corruption. Who could that be? Amy Klobuchar? New York\u2019s own Gov. Andrew Cuomo? That remains to be seen.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that while the mainstream media has concocted a consistent narrative claiming that Biden\u2019s son did nothing wrong, there is simply too much evidence for a thorough investigation not to be conducted \u2014 during which Joe Biden will be forced out of the race. Better for the \u00adex-veep to do the prudent and politically expedient thing now rather than have a choice imposed on him later.\n\nAndrew Stein is a former president of the New York City Council.", "description": "What\u2019s clear is that while the mainstream media has concocted a consistent narrative claiming that Biden\u2019s son did nothing wrong, there is simply too much evidence for a thorough investigation not to be conducted \u2014 during which Joe Biden will be forced out of the race.", "authors": ["September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/joe-biden-hunter.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
