Elizabeth Warren topping the field with 28 percent of the vote and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) slowly regaining his footing.\n\nThe poll, taken October 17-21, 2019, among 713 Democrat voters and Democrat-leaning independents, found Warren in the lead with 28 percent support, followed by Biden, who fell seven points behind with 21 percent support.\n\nOne of the most significant takeaways from the poll is Sanders\u2019 slow regain, coming in third place with 15 percent support. The last Quinnipiac University Poll, taken prior to the October 15 debate, showed Sanders polling at 11 percent.\n\nThe poll also shows Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with a notable boost, coming in fourth place with ten percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with five percent support. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered three percent support, with the remaining candidates seeing two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent.\n\nWhile voters still view Biden as the most viable candidate in a matchup against Trump, that position is slipping.\n\nAccording to Quinnipiac:\n\nBiden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, but he is not as strong on this question as he once was. In today\u2019s poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll and his high of 56 percent in an April 30 poll. Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent. Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic candidate for president by 28 percent of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, followed by Biden and Warren who receive 15 percent apiece, and Buttigieg with 11 percent. Sanders and Warren are at the top on the question of which candidate \u201ccares most about people like you,\u201d as Sanders gets 28 percent, Warren receives 24 percent, and Biden gets 14 percent.\n\nThe October Quinnipiac University Poll showed Warren with 30 percent to Biden\u2019s 27 percent, indicating that Sanders\u2019 slow regain is affecting the top two candidates in an impactful way.\n\n\u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,\u201d Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said of the poll\u2019s results.\n\nWarren\u2019s extended lead over Biden and Sanders\u2019 bump follows a CNN poll released this week, showing the former vice president as the clear frontrunner with 34 percent to Warren\u2019s 19 percent and Sanders\u2019 16 percent.", "description": "The state of the Democrat primary presidential race remains in flux, according to a post-debate Quinnipiac University Poll released Thursday.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Bernie-Sanders-clap-smile-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
