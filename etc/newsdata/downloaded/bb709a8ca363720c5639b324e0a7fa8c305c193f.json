The merits of salted popcorn over sweet? His thoughts on whether the Letwin amendment really has derailed Boris Johnson's plans to push through his Brexit deal by the end of the month?\n\nWe'll never know exactly what Jurgen Klopp was shouting in the ear of Jon Moss during Liverpool's draw with Manchester United on Sunday.\n\nGiven the ear-bashing he gave the fourth official throughout the 90 minutes, though, it's safe to assume they went beyond typical small talk.\n\nJurgen Klopp cut a tense figure on the Old Trafford touchline as his side made a slow start\n\nOn several occasions fourth official Jon Moss had to calm down the Liverpool manager\n\nWhile Ole Gunnar Solskjaer spent much of the game in his seat, the Liverpool boss struggled to stand still. He was pacing, gesticulating and chuntering away.\n\nThere was the usual dose of picture-book smiles and wild clapping. There was anger, too.\n\nIt was fourth official Moss who became Klopp's human stress-ball as frustrations grew for the visitors at Old Trafford.\n\nFor nearly an hour United led through Marcus Rashford's opener until Adam Lallana's late goal ensured Liverpool ended the week six points clear atop the Premier League.\n\nKlopp took his side to Old Trafford knowing victory would break a record run in English football\n\nThey remain the envy of the division yet Solskjaer's decision to adopt a back three and push his wing-backs high up the pitch frustrated Liverpool for long periods.\n\nTheir full-backs weren't given the freedom of the flanks they often enjoy, at least until Andy Robertson's decisive late cross.\n\nThe Reds dominated the ball but struggled to fashion many chances. There was plenty about his side's display to boil Klopp's blood.\n\nYet it was the performance of the officials that seemed to irk him most.\n\nFirst there was the United opener, awarded despite replays showing Divock Origi may have been fouled in the build-up.\n\nThen there was Sadio Mane's disallowed equaliser, ruled out after VAR adjudged he had handled the ball.\n\nOnly late on did Liverpool make the breakthrough, as Andy Robertson found Adam Lallana\n\nEven after Lallana earned his side a share of the spoils, Klopp was frustrated, complaining of United's lack of ambition.\n\n'This year, last year, the year before, they just defend,' he said.\n\n'That's how it is. It is OK. It is no criticism. It is just a fact.\n\n'When you think about Manchester United against Liverpool, you think both teams are trying like this. But it is not. We try.'\n\nHis mood had hardly been much rosier before the game, when the boss accused the media of 'building a banana skin' with 'joke' combined XIs packed only with his players.\n\nKlopp accused the media of creating a 'banana skin' by picking an all-Liverpool combined XI\n\nHis comments before and after the game were unusually tetchy for the affable German\n\n'The world at the moment is a circus and we are at the centre. I'm not influenced by it,' he said.\n\nThey are certainly in the eye of the storm. That comes with the territory when you're top of the Premier League.\n\nSunday's draw ended their hopes of a record-equalling run of 18 consecutive Premier League wins. But expectations have not been tempered.\n\nMake no mistake: the pressure on Liverpool to end their long wait for a title is absolutely suffocating.\n\nKlopp insists he's not 'influenced' by the spotlight that brings. His words and demeanour in recent days will lead to suggestions to the contrary.\n\nYou could forgive any added nerves. After all, he's been here before.\n\nKlopp's berating of the fourth official perhaps betrayed that he is under huge pressure\n\nBack in January, Liverpool went to the Etihad knowing victory over title rivals Manchester City would put them 10 points clear.\n\nThey stumbled then, and City did the rest.\n\nKlopp can ill-afford history to repeat itself. He's the self-proclaimed 'Normal One' and it's not unusual for such pressure to weigh heavily.\n\nFourth officials everywhere will hope his shoulders are broad enough to carry the burden.", "description": "We'll never know exactly what Jurgen Klopp was shouting in the ear of Jon Moss during Liverpool's draw with Manchester United on Sunday.
