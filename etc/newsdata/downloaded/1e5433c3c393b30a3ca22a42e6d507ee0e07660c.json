Also in the mix is Johnson's first Prime Minister's Questions, plus Chancellor Sajid Javid will unveil his first spending review.\n\nHere's how it could all pan out (timings are all U.K. and subject to change):\n\n8 a.m.: Meeting of the political Cabinet in Downing Street, as Boris Johnson seeks to reassure his top team following Tuesday night's Commons defeat and lay the ground for a general election. Ministers will also hear from Sajid Javid on Wednesday afternoon's autumn spending review. A normal meeting of the Cabinet \u2014 complete with officials \u2014 will follow.\n\n10 a.m.: Behind closed doors in Downing Street, Johnson prepares for his first PMQs. If things don't pan out quite as he hopes this next month, it may also be his last.\n\nNoon: Prime Minister's Questions. Johnson and opposition Labour Party leader Corbyn will slug it out to deliver the best TV news and social media clips, but the real action will come from the benches behind the PM. Which Tory (or former Tory) MPs will be called to speak? And how many will raise concerns about the purge of the party moderates we've just seen? Keep a close eye too on Jacob Rees-Mogg's posture, following Tuesday's slouching scandal. If Corbyn doesn't crack a joke or two about that, then we might as well all give up and go home.\n\n12.45 p.m.: Sajid Javid unveils his first spending review, setting out 2020/21 budgets for Whitehall departments. The chancellor announced Wednesday morning he is pledging a further \u00a32 billion (why is it always \u00a32 billion?) for Brexit preparations, taking the total spent since the referendum to more than \u00a38 billion. You can insert your own joke about that famous magic money tree.\n\n2.45 p.m.: Hull MP Emma Hardy presents a private members' bill on compulsory purchase orders. Which means you should have about 10 minutes to leg it to the kitchen/shop/caf\u00e9 and grab a sandwich and a brew. Just make sure you're back by 3 p.m. sharp, if you want to see history in the making.\n\n3 p.m.: The Rebel Alliance takes control of the Commons. Proceedings kick off with the second reading of Hilary Benn's bill to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Expect a heated debate to follow. If you get bored, you can always keep a close eye on Iain Duncan Smith following Tuesday's snot-eating scandal (grim video here if you dare to watch \u2014 though it's not for the faint-hearted.) Keep a close eye out too for further developments in the John Bercow vs. Michael Gove stand-off, following Tuesday night's surreal rant by the speaker about Gove's kids. Gove's wife Sarah Vine is not impressed.\n\n5 p.m.: Vote on the second reading, with the rebels' 27-strong majority likely to hold. Outside on College Green, a mass anti-Brexit rally gets underway.\n\n5.20 p.m.: Bill hits committee stage, at which points a flurry of amendments may be discussed. Among them will be one by a \"Bregretful\" group of 17 Labour MPs led by Stephen Kinnock who didn't actually vote for former PM Theresa May's deal when they had the chance, but now kinda wish they had done. Their attempt to bring May's final deal back to the House for a fourth meaningful vote is not going to happen given that neither the Tory nor Labour frontbench supports the plan, but it should at least allow these MPs to tell their constituents they tried.\n\n7 p.m.: Flurry of further divisions as MPs vote on an unknown number of amendments, followed by the third reading of the bill. This could take anything up to a couple of hours. Once the bill has passed (most likely unamended), it heads on to the House of Lords for the next phase.\n\n9 p.m.? Guessing now, but somewhere around this time we should get to Boris Johnson's motion for an early election. A 90-minute debate will follow, ahead of the big vote. The PM needs the support of 424 MPs to secure an election \u2014 and without Corbyn's backing, he ain't gonna get them.\n\nAnd then it's over to the Lords: Tory peers have put down an impressive 92 amendments to the program motion setting out the timetable for Thursday's debate. Government sources say they will try to force two votes on every single one. Peers are gearing up to sit all night, ahead of the bill's debate proper on Thursday.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
