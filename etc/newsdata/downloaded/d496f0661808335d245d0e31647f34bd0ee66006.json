Andrew Cuomo. Others participating were New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, as well as health officials from a half-dozen other Democrat-led states.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe meeting marked the first attempt to create a regionalized approach to regulating the vaping and e-cigarette industries, which are at the center of a mysterious public health crisis that\u2019s been linked to lung injuries in nearly 1,300 people across the U.S. as of Oct. 8. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also reported 26 deaths in 21 states.\n\nThe recommendations, which Persichilli presented as \u201cguiding principles,\u201d include banning the sale of flavored vape products \u2014 something New York has already attempted through an executive emergency order. She also suggested standardizing labels to assure vape users of manufacturers and increasing the scale of enforcement actions against retailers who sell vaping products to people under 21.\n\n\u201cWe have a public health crisis here, and we must work together to confront it,\u201d Persichilli said.\n\nPersichilli recently led a task force that suggested similar policy changes in New Jersey, where the state Legislature is expected to begin work in November and December on bills to advance some of those recommendations \u2014 which include eliminating the sale of flavored pods and outlawing online sales.\n\nLamont called the Northeast\u2019s existing approaches on cannabis and vaping regulations a \u201cpatchwork quilt of regulation [that] makes no sense at all.\u201d Cuomo described the lack of federal intervention as \u201cliberation in the acknowledgement that we are on our own,\u201d which has prompted the governors to investigate regional action.\n\n\u201cIn theory, the federal government is supposed to get involved in issues that go beyond one state\u2019s borders. That is not happening on this issue,\u201d Cuomo said before citing New York and New Jersey\u2019s joint control over the Port Authority as an example of how state governments can collaborate on a more \u201cintelligent form of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis extrapolates on that intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a regional issue, and to the extent we can collaborate and do [it] as a collective, that is great.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the states would collectively legislate and enforce specific bans on individual substances. Each state has its own independent mechanism for regulating its respective cannabis industry, for instance, and the creation of regionalized standards for e-cigarettes and vapes would likely require extensive legislative or executive action.\n\n\u201cThe more coordinated and harmonious we can be, the better off we\u2019ll all individually be,\u201d said Murphy, the incoming chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, after hearing Persichilli\u2019s recommendations. \u201cYour own legislative reality is your own legislative reality, your executive order authority is your own, but I\u2019m optimistic we can do [marijuana and vaping regulations] in a very coordinated way.\u201d\n\nMurphy\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to pass legislation to legalize recreational cannabis is perhaps emblematic of the likely challenges faced by state leaders in the months ahead. While Democrats control strong majorities in both houses of the New Jersey Legislature, disagreements on issues like criminal justice reform, enforcement and industry regulation dragged down the momentum of legislation that appeared almost certain to pass in 2018.\n\nNew Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney \u2014 who also sat on the Cuomo-led panel with New York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins \u2014 told POLITICO he was optimistic regionwide standards could be implemented.\n\nSweeney said he\u2019d like to include some of his own recommendations to limit the supply of vaping products to certain retailers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in every convenience store. It\u2019s everywhere,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cYou know, we have liquor stores for a reason. Licensing and enforcement are going to be critical.\n\nShannon Young contributed to this report.", "description": "The recommendations were presented Thursday morning during a closed-door information session in New York City.", "authors": ["Sam Sutton", "Amanda Eisenberg"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e1/17/b755ae604a1d9602811a6b1da01f/gettyimages-1158297482-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
