(Photo: Konstanin Fomin)\n\nAs Gizmodo reported from New York, 4 million of people in 150 countries turned out for a gigantic global climate strike, a resounding demand to world leaders to act on climate change. Not so much in Russia.\n\nWhile Berlin, London, and Melbourne reported drawing around 100,000 participants each, Greenpeace Russia tweeted photos of only sparse gatherings in cities across Russia. In Moscow, a small group of activists took turns holding signs one at a time, due to Russia\u2019s restrictive laws on public protest.\n\nA line of protesters waiting for their turn to participate in single person protest in the center of Moscow https://t.co/d9BWNshidM \u2014 Makichyan Arshak (@MakichyanA) September 20, 2019\n\nFriday's and Saturday\u2019s global strikes were the latest in a series of youth-led actions, galvanised in no small part by a 16-year-old Nobel Prize nominee Greta Thunberg. A lesser-know activist, 25-year-old Muscovite Arshak Makichyan, inspired by Thunberg, has been picketing in Moscow alone every Friday for 28 weeks.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was very important to do something, and [doing it alone] was the only way,\u201d he told Gizmodo.\n\nArshak Makichyan takes his turn in a single-person picket in Central Moscow on September 20, 2019. (Photo: Konstanin Fomin)\n\nOver the years, the Russian government has craftily thought up numerous methods of banning protests, but there\u2019s a workaround: silent picketers are allowed to protest solo without a permit (though authorities, too, have found workarounds). Makichyan said he applied for a Climate Strike permit but was refused. He said that around 30 or 40 people arrived to join him for the Climate Strike picket on Friday, each waiting their turn to hold a sign.\n\nSaturday's action comes weeks after a recent series of unsanctioned and sanctioned opposition protests in which at least 2,000 protesters and their leaders were detained.\n\nIn March, Makichyan estimated that around 50 people joined him for a sanctioned climate strike in Sokolniki Park, which he described as \u201cso quiet... you might as well protest in a forest.\u201d Globally, more than 1.5 million young adults turned out. He claims that authorities cancelled their May climate strike due to a permit \u201ctechnicality.\u201d Young adults turned out at roughly 1,600 protests in 125 countries.\n\nPhotographer Konstanin Fomin told Gizmodo that a protest of waste management practices will be taking place at the park on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking to the Moscow Times in April while holding a sign reading \u201cthe media is silent about global warming, and we are the ones that will suffer,\u201d Makichyan said that \u201cmost of the population [in Russia] doesn\u2019t really understand what global warming is.\u201d In 2018, the European Commission and Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that Russia was the world\u2019s fourth top carbon dioxide emitter.\n\n\u201cSo quiet... you might as well protest in a forest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAuthorities very often reject [protest] applications on spurious grounds,\u201d Natalia Prilutskaya, Amnesty International\u2019s Regional researcher on Russia, told Gizmodo. \u201cThey say there is another protest on the same day at the same time, which could be legitimate. But very often, it\u2019s suspected that these protests are fake or by pro-government groups. And then often the allocated places for protests are very far from the city or in a park at 7pm where people can\u2019t really see what the protest is about.\u201d\n\nClimate groups organising protests can also be suppressed by various mechanisms, Prilutskaya noted. Any NGO which accepts funding as low as a single dollar from outside of Russia must label itself a \u201cforeign agent,\u201d the negative connotation of which makes lawmakers reluctant to work with them.\n\nOne such \u201cforeign agent,\u201d the co-founder of the Russian environmental activist group Ecodefense, Alexandra Korolewa, has recently fled to Germany where she has applied for political asylum. Refusing to pay fines for not labelling the organisation \u201ccorrectly,\u201d she reportedly faces a potential two-year prison sentence. (At this writing, Gizmodo has not yet heard back for request for comment.)\n\nHuman Rights Watch has called 2019 a \u201cbleak year\u201d for human rights in Russia, with crackdowns on social media and \u201cfake news\u201d legislation censoring online criticism of authority.\n\n\u201cOn the plus side,\u201d Prilutskaya said, \u201cI think it\u2019s really encouraging to see that there\u2019s more and more laypeople who, until probably a year ago, didn\u2019t even want to get into the details of what\u2019s going on with the local rubbish dump or coal mine,\u201d in the Arkhangelsk and Kemerovo regions, respectively. \u201cWhen pressure inside Russia grows, with mass activism, then some changes are possible. They may be minute and slow, but they\u2019re possible.\u201d", "description": "As Gizmodo reported from New York, 4 million of people in 150 countries turned out for a gigantic global climate strike, a resounding demand to world leaders to act on climate change.
