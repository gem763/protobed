If you don\u2019t know what that is yet, it\u2019s the next generation of wireless protocols. And if it hasn\u2019t already, it\u2019s going to change your life \u2026 dramatically. Think about the difference between the world before the internet and after. Or the difference between America now and before we had electricity. Or even the difference between what life was like before the steam engine and today.\n\n3 5G Stocks to Profit From the Smart Cities Revolution Today More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSome analysts have referred to the recent arrival of 5G as the \u201cnext industrial revolution.\u201d In fact, it\u2019ll eventually change everything from how we do business to how we drive our cars to how we engage with our families in our own homes. Most importantly, however, 5G will change the way we live in cities and towns. That\u2019s because with its arrival comes the arrival of \u201csmart cities.\u201d\n\nSmart cities are cities that update themselves in real time. Think of traffic lights that predict how many cars are coming and regulate themselves accordingly. Or streetlights that know if people are on the sidewalk and can turn on and off as needed. Smart cities might even be able to do something about finding parking spaces for everybody!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRegardless of the sci-fi dreams 5G and smart cities can bring, it\u2019s all coming soon. And today, I want to reveal to you three companies to take a second look at no matter what their earnings forecasts might be. Because with the future on the horizon, all three of these companies stand to profit in a big way \u2026\n\nBest 5G Stocks to Buy\n\nSkyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ:SWKS): After the big semiconductor boom of 2014, Skyworks Solutions\u2019 stock quickly trailed off. But this past year alone, SWKS has regained more than 32% of its share price already. That puts it back on track to reach its March 2018 highs once again, and smart investors could be looking to capitalize on that jump.\n\nNow, even though some institutional investors are stepping away from the company these days, the next generation of SWKS\u2019s transmitters are crucial for delivering 5G capabilities to tomorrow\u2019s smart cities. That means Skyworks Solutions is poised for big profits as 5G takes over the rest of the U.S. next year.\n\nPlus, with SWKS not expected to report the past quarter\u2019s earnings until Nov. 14, right now could be the perfect time to capitalize on this stock\u2019s potential \u2026 before the market prices in what this year\u2019s 5G build-up might have brought with it.\n\nAmerican Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT): Unlike with SWKS, hedge fund investors appear bullish on American Tower stock. And that\u2019s good news for individual investors because there are signs insiders are selling shares these days. But that\u2019s not necessarily anything to fear.\n\nAMT is expected to announce earnings on Oct. 31. And the share price is already up about 41% year-to-date. But even with dips in recent days, investors are still sitting on a 2.5% earnings surprise from last quarter \u2026 not to mention the role American Tower plays in today\u2019s 5G conversion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that owns approximately 171,000 communications real estate sites. As cities get smart, AMT is one organization everybody should be looking at to lead the way.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ): The real key to smart cities, however, are the networks that 5G signals will be traveling over. That\u2019s where Verizon Communications comes in.\n\nVerizon has one of the largest cellular networks in the United States. And it\u2019s currently rolling out 5G to municipalities. Included in Verizon\u2019s smart cities already are stoplight and other streetlight sensors from Boston to San Diego. And those cities and devices are only going to grow in the years to come.\n\n5G and Smart Cities: A $53 Trillion Opportunity\n\nAll in all, yesterday\u2019s science fiction is today\u2019s reality. Smart cities are coming. In some places, they\u2019re already here. And the keys to it all are the world\u2019s 5G networks.", "description": "5G is here.
