This was not the subject of our conversation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur calls had nothing to do with weapons or the story with Burisma,\u201d he added, referring to the gas company where Mr Biden's son Hunter sat on the board. He said the Ukrainian stenogramme of the conversation matched the English one.\n\nAt the same time, Mr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was open to doing a joint investigation into the situation with the United States.\n\n\u201cPlease connect your general prosecutor with ours,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only on Burisma and Biden. We have many criminal cases to look at.\u201d\n\nMr Zelenskiy met with Mr Trump on the sidelines of a United Nations session in New York in September Credit: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters More\n\nHe said he didn't want to \u201ccomment very much\u201d on the impeachment scandal because he didn't want to \u201cinterfere in any way with the elections\u201d in the United States.\n\nCongress is considering whether Mr Trump offered Ukraine a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d of aid in return for investigating Biden or unproven Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nMr Zelenskiy, however, said he only found out the aid had been held up before a meeting with vice president Mike Pence in Warsaw in September.\n\n\u201cI told him ... please help to resolve it,\" Zelenskiy said he asked Mr Pence. \u201cAnd after our meeting America unblocked the aid.\u201d\n\nBut another question is whether Mr Trump made a White House visit by Mr Zelenskiy, a top priority for the new administration in Kyiv, conditional on investigations that could benefit the US president politically.\n\nMr Zelenskiy admitted that he pushed for a meeting with Mr Trump in Poland or in Ukraine. He said he was concerned before the July phone call that relations between America and Ukraine had grown \u201ctired\u201d due to the large amount of money being spent.\n\n\u201cThis call affected one thing. I understood that we needed to get a meeting, I want to show him our team,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to get him over to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMr Zelenskiy at times grew flustered with journalists at the marathon press conference Credit: Gleb Garanich/Reuters More", "description": "Ukraine's president has denied that Donald Trump tried to \u201cblackmail\u201d him into starting an investigation linked to candidate Joe Biden, but said he would help the United States if it opened its own investigation.\u00a0 A July phone call in which Mr Trump asked Volodymyr Zelenskiy to look into shaky allegations", "authors": ["Alec Luhn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rgyfBbA6CepezjoI1m0hSQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/94e9400950b4b34663591692d558ce65", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
