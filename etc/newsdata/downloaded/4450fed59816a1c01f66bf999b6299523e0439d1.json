Rated as one of the seven wonders of the natural world, it stretches for 2,300 kilometres (1,430 miles) along the Queensland coast \u2013 from Bundaberg to the Torres Strait.\n\nIn addition to being the world\u2019s largest coral reef ecosystem, this World Heritage Site is also the planet\u2019s largest protected marine area, supporting 400 types of coral, 1,500 species of fish and 4,000 types of mollusc. Apart from a phantasmagoria of tropical fish, the reef is also home to whales, dugongs, turtles, reef sharks, dolphins and is an important bird habitat.\n\nFor the past 50 years, the Great Barrier Reef has been a magnet for divers, sailors and people who dream of finding their own South Sea paradise. The reef, therefore, has a remarkably well-developed tourist infrastructure. A number of islands, such as Lizard, Bedarra and Hayman, have their own self-contained luxury resorts \u2013 others offer little more than a tent and hammock.", "description": "Mark Chipperfield offers a guide to experiencing the Great Barrier Reef, from the hedonism of Cairns to diving on the pristine outer reef.", "authors": ["Telegraph Travel"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/February/great%2520barrier%2520reef-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-02-19"}
