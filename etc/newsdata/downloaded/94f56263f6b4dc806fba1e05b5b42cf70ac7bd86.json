No-one was detained at the time.\n\nThe recent arrests are not linked to an inquiry into suspected fraud involving transfers during the 2017-2018 season, officials say.\n\nThat investigation led to raids at the Anderlecht, Club Bruges and Standard Li\u00e8ge last October.", "description": "The suspects are held following raids in Monaco, Belgium and London over claims of money-laundering.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13FE6/production/_108749818_gettyimages-456838404.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
