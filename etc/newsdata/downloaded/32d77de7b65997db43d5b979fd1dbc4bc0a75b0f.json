It's these other parents who don't have the luxury of being able to do that.\"\n\nMilat, who is described as one of Australia's worst serial killers , dumped his victims' bodies in the Belanglo State Forest between 1989 and 1992.\n\nHis horrific crimes were uncovered after orienteers stumbled upon two decaying corpses partially buried in the Belanglo State Forest.\n\nTwo missing British nannies Joanne Walters, 22, and Caroline Clarke, 21, were to be the first of seven sets of human remains found in shallow graves scattered around the forest.\n\nCaroline, a former Pizza Hut assistant manager, had gone to Australia in 1991 on a dream working holiday, after spending months saving up to pay for her trip.\n\nShe and Joanne, a nanny, from Mid Glamorgan, were hitching south from Sydney down the Hume Highway when they accepted a lift from Milat.\n\nThey were subsequently reported missing and Caroline\u2019s parents flew out to Australia in August, 1992, to help in the search.\n\nThe following month, the bodies of both backpackers were found in shallow graves.\n\nCaroline had been stabbed and shot 10 times in the head.\n\nOver the course of a year, five more victims' remains were discovered - including the body of decapitated traveller Anja Habschied, whose head has never been found.\n\nHis other victims included Deborah Everist and James Gibson, both 19, from Victoria, Simone Schmidl, 21, from Germany, and Gabor Neugebauer, 21, from Germany\n\nMilat had been a road worker at the time of his crimes, giving the weapons-obsessed ex-convict opportunity to scope out the forest alongside the remote highway as his hitchhiker hunting ground.\n\nIt was noted during his trial many victims were shot multiple times, as if he had been using them for target practice.\n\nCourt documents showed sexual interference with the corpses, either before or after the victims' deaths, in all but one case.\n\n(Image: Fairfax Media via Getty)\n\nMilat was convicted in 1996 and jailed for life, but never admitted to the murders.\n\nThe detested serial killer had previously spent time in hospital before his final trip to his deathbed.\n\nIn 2009 Milat cut off his pinky finger with a plastic knife- reportedly with the intent to send it to the High Court. The finger could not be surgically reattached.\n\nIn 2001, the killer injured himself swallowing razors and staples.\n\nIn 2011, he staged a hunger strike, losing 25kg in a bid to get a Playstation.", "description": "Australian Serial killer Ivan Milat who murdered seven young backpackers including two young Brits has died of cancer", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Image", "News", "Unknown", "Chronicle Live Ws", "Reuters", "Fairfax Media Via Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707669.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RIP-Serial-killer-who-murdered-Hexham-backpacker-Caroline-Clarke-on-his-death-bed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
