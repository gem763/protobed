In June, Reuters reported that Ethiopia would issue the licenses by the end of the year, quoting Ethiopian officials and telecoms executives with direct knowledge of the process.\n\nThe issuing of licenses will end a state monopoly and open up one of the world\u2019s last major closed telecoms markets in the country of around 100 million.\n\nPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a push to liberalize the country\u2019s economy last year.\n\nThe communications regulator, formed after parliament passed a law covering the liberalization of the sector, will hold a meeting on Nov. 12 in the Ethiopian capital to answer questions of interested companies, Balcha said.\n\nVodafone (VOD.L), South African operator MTN (MTNJ.J), France\u2019s Orange (ORAN.PA) and Etisalat ETEL.AD of the United Arab Emirates are likely to be among the leading contenders vying for entry into the Ethiopian market.", "description": "Ethiopia plans to award two telecoms licenses to multinational mobile companies by April 2020, breaking the state monopoly by April, the new communications regulator said on Tuesday, an apparent delay in the timeline officials had previously set.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
