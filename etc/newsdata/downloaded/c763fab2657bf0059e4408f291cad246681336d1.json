It was something I knew when I arrived at the airport, so I went ahead and took some extra time to grab breakfast. It was also a detail shared with me courtesy of the airline\u2019s app.\n\nI fly a ton, so I have the apps for all major airlines installed on my phone and they\u2019re beyond helpful.\n\nFind Out About Delays\n\nThe biggest win for having the app installed is you\u2019ll get a push notification when your flight is delayed. There are obviously tons of other apps that do this too (I love TripIt), but for your average traveller, your airline\u2019s app will do.\n\nFind Out When You\u2019re Boarding\n\nThat same delayed flight actually left 45 minutes before we were scheduled to under the original delay. Had I not had the airline\u2019s app on my phone I\u2019m fairly confident I would have missed it. Not only did I get a push notification about the updated departure, but I also got one letting me know boarding had begun (my indication that the bathroom line wasn\u2019t worth it).\n\nChange Your Seats\n\nA surprising amount of people I\u2019ve encountered don\u2019t seems to realise you can swap your seats directly in the airline\u2019s app. I personally love to fly in aisle seats close to the front of the plane. I\u2019ll check the app once I get to the gate to see if one closer to the front has opened up, presuming I\u2019m not in one already.\n\nSeats at the front of the plane are typically reserved for frequent fliers during the booking process, but open up closer to departure. Also, some of those frequent fliers might get bumped to a premium class, freeing up their snazzy regular seat. If you don\u2019t like the seat you\u2019re assigned, swapping in the app is easier than talking to a gate agent.\n\nRebook Yourself\n\nFlight delays happen. Flight cancellations happen. Most airline\u2019s apps allow you to rebook yourself (for free!) when those issues arise so you don\u2019t have to wait in that insane line at customer service.\n\nI\u2019ve had connecting flights delayed and cancelled dozens of times and been able to find myself a suitable replacement before I even land at the next airport. That means I can walk off my plane and go directly to my new flight without talking to anyone. Even better, I might nab the last seat on a later flight before other passengers realise our original has an issue.\n\nFind Your Bag\n\nMost airlines also track your bags in-app now as well, so you can see your bag is safely on the plane. My personal favourite part of this feature: you can also often get a push notification when your bag is about to come around the carousel.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t already using your airline\u2019s app, download it and give it a try. I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed.", "description": "Last week I travelled on a flight which, like many others, was significantly delayed.
