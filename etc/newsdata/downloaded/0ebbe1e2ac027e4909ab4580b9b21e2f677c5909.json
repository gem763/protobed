The crane that remains on top of the building is now more stable and will be cut down piece by piece, he said.\n\nThree windows at the nearby Saenger Theatre were broken, but it is unclear whether other surrounding buildings sustained any damage, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell told reporters.\n\nGerald Herbert/AP\n\nThe next objective for crews is to retrieve the remains of two of the victims who died last weekend and then to assess a plan to demolish the structure completely, Cantrell said.\n\nThree workers were killed and dozens more people were injured after the cranes collapsed on Oct. 12. The bodies that are still inside the building are expected to still be in the same place as before, McConnell said.\n\nThe cranes were a source of major concern as they continued to sway after the accident.\n\nThe demolition was originally planned for Friday but was delayed until Sunday. The delay came after city officials determined that the cranes were more damaged than previously thought.\n\nWGNO\n\nCity officials ordered an evacuation of the area surrounding the partially collapsed hotel, located on the edge of the historic French Quarter, on Sunday morning. Demolition crews attached small explosives known as energetic materials to the cranes in an effort to bring them down in the same place as where they were standing several stories above the ground.\n\nOne crane stood at about 270 feet high and the other at about 300 feet high, The Associated Press reported.\n\nTen of the injured victims have filed a lawsuit against five companies involved in the construction.\n\nABC News' Darren Reynolds and Ella Torres contributed to this report.", "description": "Crews have conducted a controlled demolition at the Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans to bring down two cranes standing at the site.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/crane-2-abc-er-191020_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
