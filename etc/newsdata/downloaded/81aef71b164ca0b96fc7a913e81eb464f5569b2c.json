Yeah. People are mad,\u201d Randy Hoback, a Conservative Party member of Parliament in central Saskatchewan told POLITICO. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it like this.\u201d\n\nCitizens in the Western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan agitated for political change in Ottawa over the last year as attempts to build a coastal pipeline expansion continued to falter and as farmers got trounced by trade tiffs with China.\n\nThey got what they wanted in their region \u2014 Conservatives swept all but one parliamentary seat in the elections, leaving Trudeau\u2019s Liberals with virtually no presence in Canada\u2019s oil country. But it didn\u2019t translate to new federal leadership, as Trudeau\u2019s party dominated in Eastern Canadian cities, including Toronto and Montreal, and still commands a strong plurality of seats in Parliament.\n\nThe result: talk of a break with the rest of Canada \u2014 dubbed \u201c Wexit\u201d on social media \u2014 is accelerating as some in the western part of the country say enough is enough.\n\n\u201cIs it real? Yeah. People are mad. I\u2019ve never seen it like this.\u201d - Randy Hoback, a Conservative Party member of Parliament in central Saskatchewan\n\nA Trudeau spokesperson said the government is considering ways to incorporate western perspectives into the incoming government. Some pundits are suggesting he should take the rare step \u2014 for Canada \u2014 of appointing an unelected person to the Cabinet he'll swear in on Nov. 20 to ensure that oil country\u2019s views are heard.\n\nThe elections also breathed new life into a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois separatist party previously believed to have been extinguished in the East. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois reinvented itself \u2014 by downplaying talk of independence, ironically \u2014 and more than tripled its seat-count from 10 to 32.\n\nLong the two most restive regions of Canada\u2019s federations, Alberta and Quebec have often shared similar complaints about an intrusive federal government; Quebec\u2019s concerns, in particular, occasionally dominated the national agenda as the province nearly left Canada.\n\nBut the political dynamics in western Canada are driving the conversation in Ottawa this week. And at the heart of the West\u2019s disillusionment is the oil industry, which is a major driver of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nPoliticians in Alberta and Saskatchewan say the livelihoods of many of their residents are under attack from Ottawa, given the Trudeau government\u2019s focus on shrinking Canada\u2019s carbon footprint to combat climate change.\n\n\u201cI think this is maybe a little bit more serious,\u201d said University of Calgary political scientist Barry Cooper. \u201cAnd because so much of it is symbolized in this kind of concatenation of environmentalism and basic anti-Alberta sentiments, it might actually lead to something.\u201d\n\nThe head of the province, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, regularly joins in the Ottawa-bashing, including last week when he blamed the Trudeau-led economy for his own budget cuts.\n\nKenney has obliquely nodded at separatist sentiments since coming into power last spring, though he used the months before the federal election to call on Canadians to vote Trudeau\u2019s party out of power, rather than pushing for his province to go it alone.\n\nWith the results in, Kenney is calling out Ottawa as unsupportive during the province\u2019s economic downturn and imploring Albertans to \u201cbe self-reliant.\u201d\n\nKenney faces a complex dual challenge: Being seen as fighting for Alberta without letting nationalist passions rage out of control. David Cameron famously got burned trying to simultaneously fan, and contain, those nationalist flames, with the result being Brexit.\u201d\n\nTrudeau will need to overcome the perception in Western Canada that he campaigned against Alberta and Saskatchewan in the final days before the election if he wants to prevent alienation from growing, Hoback said.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau departs a campaign stop Sept. 23.

It\u2019s held two referendums on the issue, and in the most recent, in 1995, Quebecers came within one percentage point of voting to leave Canada.\n\nBut the formerly powerful provincial party, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, has sunk to fourth place in the provincial legislature.\n\nSupport for independence, which decades ago had soared into the high-50s, languished in the low-30s in surveys over the last few years.\n\nOne academic who studies opinion polling and has analyzed hundreds of surveys on Quebec independence since the 1970s says the movement is at its nadir.\n\n\u201cYou know that sovereignty is low when pollsters don\u2019t ask the question anymore,\u201d said Claire Durand of the University of Montreal.\n\nSome of the PQ\u2019s senior members have quit to form other parties, including the current premier of Quebec, who runs a soft-right government that never talks about separation.\n\nSo how did a federal version of the separatist party triple its seat-count in Monday\u2019s election and re-emerge as a political force that potentially cost Trudeau a parliamentary majority?\n\nBy not talking about separation at all.\n\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, historically seen as a minor-league adjunct to the PQ and a messenger for separatists\u2019 complaints to the federal Parliament, was on the verge of extinction. But in this campaign, it managed to reinvent itself.\n\nThe new party leader, Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, took up every cause promoted by popular Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault.\n\nBut a telling moment occurred during Blanchet\u2019s triumphant election-night speech: Supporters began chanting the old Quebec independence slogan, \u201cOn veut un pays! (We want a country!)\u201d and Blanchet replied, \u201cMe too,\u201d before he smothered those embers with a wet blanket: \u201cFor this time, the achievement of [independence] is not our mandate.\u201d\n\nQuebec\u2019s and Alberta\u2019s independence movements differ fundamentally in that the francophone province\u2019s issues have always revolved around identity and culture, whereas Alberta\u2019s has always been political, Bratt said.\n\n\"But when people see Quebec opposed to pipelines and receiving equalization [payments], you can understand where that anger comes from,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, we\u2019re paying you, and you\u2019re running low-cost daycare and stopping Alberta\u2019s resources from getting to market, but you\u2019ll take our money. And that\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\n\nThe University of Calgary\u2019s Cooper says Alberta has the economic ability to achieve independence, unlike Quebec. And being independent from Ottawa would give the region more latitude to insist on things like building pipelines to the British Columbia coast, he said \u2014 or else Vancouver doesn\u2019t get gas deliveries, or every train traveling from east to west gets stopped for inspection in a newly independent Alberta.\n\nStill, Alberta is landlocked and there would be huge costs in transitioning away from Canada, Bratt notes. And even though Alberta\u2019s economy has been sluggish for the last five years, its economy still outperforms much of the rest of the country.\n\nBut there\u2019s another factor at play in Alberta\u2019s anger: The prime minister is a Trudeau.\n\nAlbertans still recoil at the memory of the National Energy Program, which was instituted by Justin Trudeau\u2019s father, the late Pierre Elliott Trudeau. That policy was geared toward handing Ottawa more control over Canada\u2019s oil industry.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is the extent to which separatist passions die down as Canadians gets further away from Election Day or continue to simmer \u2014 and how the country\u2019s politicians, both federal and provincial, respond to that.\n\n\u201cI love my country. I\u2019m proud of what Canada has been and what it can be together. We are the strongest together, so I\u2019m going to fight for a unified Canada,\u201d said Hoback, the Conservative MP.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t get to control the chess board. Justin Trudeau does,\u201d he added. \u201cWe'll see what he does. The ball\u2019s in his court.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Randy Hoback", "A Conservative Party Member Of Parliament In Central Saskatchewan"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ef/aa/77528d844392839eeca933e25b5e/20191028-trudeau-election-night-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
