It found that healthcare expenses \u2013 medical tests, alternative medicine, consultation, hospitalization, and medications \u2013 and loss in productivity \u2013 missed work days or impacts on capacity to carry out daily jobs \u2013 added up to the cost associated with migraine.\n\nThe research identified two groups of people with migraine who are also full-time employees in Singapore. The first group, referred to as \u201clower end episodic migraine\u201d, were patients with three or less migraine days per month. This group incurred a S$5,040 per capial cost in 2018.\n\nThe second group, \u201cupper end episodic migraine\u2019\u201d, comprised migraine sufferers who had four to 14 migraine days a month. This group incurred per capial cost of S$14,860.\n\nOn average, migraine sufferers here missed 9.8 work days a year. Those who went to work with a migraine had greatly reduced abilities to perform their tasks, causing losses in productivity time of about 7.4 days a year, the report said.\n\nWhile healthcare costs did not contribute a majority of the economic burden, the spending pattern indicated the need for more accurate diagnosis and effective treatment, the report said. Participants of the study revealed that the largest contributor to healthcare cost was medical tests (41 per cent), followed by alternative medications (18 per cent), consultations (16 per cent), hospitalisations (13 per cent) and medication (11 per cent).\n\n\u201cOur results show that the impact of migraine goes beyond the individual,\u201d Dr Eric Finkelstein, Professor at the health services and systems research programme at Duke-NUS Medical School, and co-author of the study, said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that knowing the estimated total costs of migraine, both in terms of monetary value and productivity levels, will drive further research into this health issue, catalyze conversations and support measures towards addressing a problem that impacts our society as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat is a migraine?\n\nMigraine is a common and recurrent neurological disorder characterized by unilateral headaches of moderate to severe intensity that typically last between four and 72 hours.\n\nIt is often accompanied by a wide array of symptoms such as nausea, sensitivity to light, sound and routine physical activity.\n\nMostly affecting individuals aged 30-40, approximately 90 per cent of people with migraine experience their first attack before age 40.\n\nIn Singapore, migraine affects up to 10 per cent of the population, with about 100 new patients added every month at the patient referral clinic for headache disorders at the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nAccording to Dr Jonathan Jia Yuan Ong, president of the headache society of Singapore and consultant at the division of neurology at National University Hospital, one in four patients in Singapore do not seek medical treatment for their migraine.\n\n\u201cFor those who do try to manage the condition, they typically resorted to acute medications which may not be the most effective strategy in the long term, adding to their overall healthcare costs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the cost and productivity losses, the study indicates that the current coping strategies adopted by patients are ineffective. Public and private organisations and employers must explore options together, in order to help patients cope better with the symptoms,\u201d Celine Landie, managing director of Novartis Singapore and Asian emerging markets, said.\n\nSome of the options that employers can explore include designing more supportive work policies or driving workplace culture changes that educate the workforce about migraine, she said.", "description": "Business Insider - Here's a real headache that won't go away..
