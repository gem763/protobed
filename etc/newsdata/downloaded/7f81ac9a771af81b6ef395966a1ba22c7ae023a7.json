In fact, it would be even easier than that. Karim said that some labs do the work of approximating various products and then actively try to sell those nameless liquids, gels, and creams to existing brands. \u201cJoe\u2019s Face Wash could turn around in a couple weeks,\u201d Karim told me. \u201cThey just have it ready to go, and they\u2019re going to print labels and put it on there.\u201d (One expert I talked with even said it\u2019s possible that Vi-Jon, which makes Mountain Falls, might be making face wash for other retailers, such as CVS, too.)\n\nYoung told me that brands can\u2019t do much to halt this private-label process. So much of their sales come from retailers like CVS that they can\u2019t just take their business elsewhere. \u201cIf I\u2019m Galderma \u2026 do I love sitting on the shelf next to the retailer\u2019s private-label version?\u201d Young said. \u201cNo, but if I walk around the store, they\u2019re doing it with every other major brand \u2026 It\u2019s a fact of life. It\u2019s just that these retailers are so big, and so powerful, that if I want to stay in there, welcome aboard.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Joe Pinsker", "Theatlantic.Com Technology Archive Amazon-My-Face-Wash-And-Me"], "top_image": ""}
