Its candidate, Mike Mohring, has publicly called H\u00f6cke a Nazi.\n\nA coalition is currently in power consisting of the Social Democrats, the Greens and led by state president Bodo Ramelow.\n\nIt's the first state to be ruled by the left since Germany reunified in 1990.\n\nControversially the intelligence services illegally opened a file on him for links with the communist party in the 1990s.\n\nBut now the SPD is expected to lose around 9% of the vote, which could make it difficult for Ramelow to form another coalition.\n\nMeanwhile, Hocke's campaign in Thuringia has been trying to recreate the spirit of the protests in old Communist East Germany that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago.\n\nBut even Hocke's fellow AFD party leaders in western Germany are distancing themselves from his extreme right-wing rhetoric.", "description": "Last month the AFD made big gains in two other regional elections in former communist east Germany.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/01/60/1000x563_cmsv2_6d12e679-e029-5e8b-8c48-b5ffa9c067f9-4260160.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
