He was an opposition leader at the time.\n\nMalaysia is one of several countries in Asia that have turned to such legislation, emboldened by US President Donald Trump\u2019s fulminations against \u201cfake news\u201d, but activists warn authoritarian regimes will use the laws to target opponents.\n\nLast week, a law to combat fake news came into effect in Singapore despite criticism from tech giants and activists.", "description": "Kuala Lumpur (AFP) \u2013 Malaysian lawmakers voted to repeal a controversial law Wednesday that punished spreading \u201cfake news\u201d with up to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/36098d_as-as-hefty-jail-terms-legislation-punished-dissemination-authorities-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
