Opening statements are scheduled for Oct. 21 in the first case to test local governments\u2019 claims that opioid makers and distributors fanned demand for the highly addictive pain medications.\n\nThe four companies -- McKesson, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. -\u2013 are seeking to resolve all opioid suits filed against them by U.S. states, cities and counties. If their settlement proposals are accepted, they\u2019d be removed from the current trial and any further opioid litigation.\n\nThe chief executive officer of a fifth defendant at the trial, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., wasn\u2019t summoned to court because the pharmacy chain has shown no interest in settling, the people said. But another executive will attend, a third person familiar with the meeting said.\n\n2,000 Lawsuits\n\nIn all, more than 2,000 municipalities have sued pharma companies to recoup billions of dollars spent battling the fallout from opioid addiction and overdoses. Next week\u2019s trial is on behalf of just two Ohio counties.\n\nKelley Dougherty, a spokeswoman for Teva, declined to comment on whether CEO Kare Schultz would be in Cleveland for the meeting. Gabe Weissman, an AmerisourceBergen spokesman, also declined to say whether CEO Steven Collis would be making the trip.\n\nSpokeswomen for McKesson and Cardinal Health didn\u2019t immediately return calls and emails late Wednesday about whether McKesson CEO Brian Tyler and Cardinal Health CEO Michael Kaufmann would be present. Jim Cohn, a Walgreens spokesman, said the company doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\n\nFriday\u2019s meeting, which will include state attorneys general who have sued separately and are backing the deals, may solidify a framework for resolving all the cases in a settlement that could wind up being worth more than $50 billion, the people said.\n\nRead More: J&J Makes $4 Billion Opioid Offer as Distributors Seek Deal\n\nMcKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen are offering to pay a combined $18 billion over 18 years to wipe out opioid suits filed against the distributors, the people said. Teva is offering more than $15 billion in generic drugs, including those that help fight opioid overdoses, the people said.\n\nDrugmaker Johnson & Johnson has offered to resolve all the cases against it for $4 billion. CEO Alex Gorsky won\u2019t be present for the Cleveland meeting because the company paid $20.4 million to settle the claims against it by the two counties heading to trial next week, the people said.\n\nAnother opioid maker, Purdue Pharma LP, sought bankruptcy protection in September to facilitate a $10 billion settlement proposal. That deal guarantees $3 billion from the company\u2019s owners, the Sackler family, and relies largely on future revenues generated by sales of drugs.\n\n(Updates with meeting participant)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jef Feeley in Wilmington, Delaware at jfeeley@bloomberg.net;Riley Griffin in New York at rgriffin42@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The CEOs of McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc. and two other companies seeking to settle legal claims over their handling of opioid painkillers were summoned to meet with a judge in hopes of hammering out a final deal, according to two people familiar with the matter.U.S. District Judge", "authors": ["Jef Feeley", "Riley Griffin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dUnbEAiTKlZapUSjjte0mQ--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/53545a5db616bf47da4a753984615415", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
