Apple, in a classic weird uncle move, is trying to convince the youth they need slow-mo selfies, or slofies, in their life. The internet gave it a piece of its mind \u2013 though to be clear, a hands on might change everything.\n\nEverything Apple Announced Today Every year it feels like Apple\u2019s big iPhone event offers fewer and fewer surprises. This year was no different. Once again, we got three new phones and a new Apple Watch. But we also got some new and interesting details about the company\u2019s future. Read more\n\nThe iPhone 11 series was unveiled by Apple today and we now have a better idea of what to expect from the upcoming devices. They'll now come with a new mode for the selfie cam allowing you to slow everything way down. It's also invented a new word to go with it; the 'slofie'.\n\nNew slow motion feature available on the front camera... and a new word #Slofies #iPhone11 #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/8Jqx4YB2DA \u2014 Francisco Jeronimo (@fjeronimo) September 10, 2019\n\nApple's site reckons it'll record in 120 frames per second on it's 12-megapixel front-facing camera so you can look like a professional model when it all slows down.\n\n\"Everything looks cooler at 120 fps, even if you're just saying 'cheese', waving hello or tossing your hair in the breeze. And now you can add more of everything to your selfies thanks to the new 12\u2011megapixel TrueDepth camera. Just turn your iPhone to landscape and the camera automatically zooms out to fit more in,\" Apple's site read.\n\nSo, for the minimum price of $1199, you too can have a chance to capture your face in slow-mo. RIP to all the parents out there having to listen to deny their children's well-worded arguments for an expensive birthday present.\n\nThe internet's reaction was understandably savage.\n\nThat moment when you watched 2 hours of the #AppleEvent only to learn about #slofies ????????\u200d\u2640\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/Ma30EPSfG7 \u2014 Jaime Donally (@JaimeDonally) September 10, 2019\n\nInstagram is about to explode with #slofies until all of 2020 in 5, 4, 3, 2.... pic.twitter.com/AeiCNeOto2 \u2014 Danny Dimes Jones (@GeezyRunThis) September 10, 2019\n\nApple just coined the term #Slowfie, for a slow-motion selfie taken with the new iPhone 11 front-facing camera.
