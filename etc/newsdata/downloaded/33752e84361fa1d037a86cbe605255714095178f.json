Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.\n\n\u201cWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back. The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend,\u201d tweeted Haley.\n\nGraham wrote: I don\u2019t know all the details regarding President Trump\u2019s decision in northern Syria. In process of setting up phone call with Secretary Pompeo. If press reports are accurate this is a disaster in the making.\u201d\n\nIn the face of the criticism, President Trump affirmed the decision was rooted in his \u201cAmerican First\u201d foreign policy.\n\n\u201cWE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN,\u201d the president said.\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "Mitt Romney condemned President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops in northern Syria, stating the move is a \"betrayal\" of the Kurds.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_19158824793069-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
