They\u2019ve got it all wrong. Dogs actually make the world a better place!\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s time to recognize \u201cNational Dog Day\u201d \u2013 an annual celebration every August 26th designed to encourage canine ownership along with raising awareness of the plight of man\u2019s best friend.\n\nWith the exception of graduate school and a few years prior to getting married, I\u2019ve been living with a dog almost all of my life.\n\nAs a little kid, I thought everybody had one. The sounds of our neighborhood included plenty of barking mutts, especially our next-door neighbor\u2019s basset hound, Maggie, whose big ears dragged on the ground. She howled every time she wanted to come inside the house.\n\nLike so many other people, our dogs were just part of the everyday rhythm of living. As somebody once appropriately observed, \u201cDogs aren\u2019t like members of the family. They are members of your family.\u201d\n\nMy brothers and sister and I will never forget our furry friends, including Snoopy, Daisy and Patriot. Since beginning to raise my own family we\u2019ve enjoyed the companionship of Shep, Macy, Sawyer and now Shadow.\n\nI\u2019m no expert on our four-legged buddies, but having owned many, including our current Great Dane, I would suggest that the following things about dogs are true:\n\n1. Puppies are really cute but also a whole lot of really hard work. Yet, Peanuts creator Charles Schulz was right. \u201cHappiness is a warm puppy.\u201d\n\n2. Speaking of young canines, it\u2019s less painful for a Red Cross worker to draw blood than to have an 8 week-old dog bite you with those sharp puppy teeth.\n\n3. Somehow, your dog is always smarter than your neighbor\u2019s dog. And better looking, too.\n\n4. If we were as loyal to our friends as our dogs are to us we\u2019d have a lot more good friends than we do.\n\n5. One of the best characteristics of dogs is that unlike people, they don\u2019t seem to hold a grudge, at least for very long.\n\n6. If you have a dog that loves to play fetch, he finds the first toss of the day just as exciting as the last.\n\n7. There is no perfect breed of dog -- only the breed that\u2019s perfect for you.\n\n8. If every person were as happy to see their spouse as a dog is to see their owner each day, the divorce rate would plummet to record lows in America.\n\n9. Mutts are wonderfully hearty and resilient. If you rescue one from a shelter they\u2019ll pay you back the rest of their life.\n\n10. The lifespan of a dog that makes it into \u201cold-age\u201d is still way too short.\n\n11. A dog\u2019s perennially good mood proves the truth that things usually work out best for those who make the best of the way things work out.\n\n12. The sight of a sleeping dog curled up in front of a roaring fire on a cold winter\u2019s day somehow makes you feel better about the fate of the world.\n\n13. It\u2019s almost impossible to leave the veterinarian\u2019s office these days without spending close to $100. But a good and caring vet is worth every penny.\n\n14. I\u2019ve heard several people say this and would probably agree: The average dog is nicer than the average person.\n\n15. Given what dogs put up with and how much a part of our families they are, I somehow feel guilty feeding them only dog food, even though I know most human food wouldn\u2019t be good for them.\n\n16. Seeing a stray dog anywhere and at any time is a sad sight.\n\n17. Dogs and children go together like chocolate and peanut butter or butter on a bagel.\n\n18. Somebody once observed that if dogs could talk they probably wouldn\u2019t be as popular or as fun as they are \u2013 but I\u2019m still curious what they would sound like if they did.\n\n19. Dogs possess one of the secrets to stress reduction \u2013 they live in the moment. They don\u2019t worry about yesterday or fear what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow.\n\n20. An aging dog is a good reminder that even the best things in life don\u2019t last forever.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n21. Having to put a dog to sleep makes you want to never have another dog. Fortunately, the joy a dog brings supersedes the emotional pain that comes with their passing and most of us almost always get another dog.\n\nSo, here\u2019s to man\u2019s best friend and all the great memories and joys our dogs have brought us through the years. If you\u2019re thinking about getting one, I say go for it. Pay a visit to your local animal shelter. Look up the local rescue group online for your favorite breed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTo paraphrase President Harry Truman, if you want a friend, get a dog \u2013 and you\u2019ll soon realize that being a friend to one will quickly become one of life\u2019s greatest pleasures.\n\nSo, dogs are not only not bad for the planet \u2013 they\u2019re actually exactly what we need in order to help make it a more loving and hospitable place for everybody.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM PAUL BATURA", "description": "It\u2019s time to recognize \u201cNational Dog Day\u201d \u2013 an annual celebration every August 26th designed to encourage canine ownership along with raising awareness of the plight of man\u2019s best friend.", "authors": ["Paul Batura", "Paul J.
