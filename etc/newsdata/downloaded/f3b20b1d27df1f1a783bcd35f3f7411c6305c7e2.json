REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/Files\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will run the world\u2019s largest current account surplus in 2019 for the fourth consecutive year, the Ifo economic institute said on Friday, likely putting further pressure on Berlin to help reduce global imbalances and stimulate domestic demand.\n\nThis year\u2019s surplus in the current account \u2014 which measures the flow of goods, services and investments \u2014 is seen at $276 billion, Ifo economist Christian Grimme told Reuters.\n\nHe added that Japan\u2019s surplus is projected to come in at $188 billion, followed by China with $182 billion.\n\nIn contrast, the United States is expected to post a current account deficit of $480 billion, the world\u2019s largest, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China and additional tariffs imposed on products imposed on Chinese products.\n\nGermany\u2019s current account surplus can mainly be attributed to the fact that far more German products and services are sold overseas than imported to Europe\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe trade imbalances have stirred the wrath of Trump, who has threatened to impose additional tariffs on German carmakers. The European Union\u2019s executive body and the International Monetary Fund have also criticised Germany\u2019s surplus.\n\nThe European Commission considers a current account surplus of 6% as sustainable over the long-term when measured by the size of a country\u2019s economy.\n\nGermany has come closer to that threshold. While the country reached a record high of 8.5% in 2015, Ifo is now projecting 7.1% this year.", "description": "Germany will run the world's largest current account surplus in 2019 for the fourth consecutive year, the Ifo economic institute said on Friday, likely putting further pressure on Berlin to help reduce global imbalances and stimulate domestic demand.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429375489&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0N0", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
