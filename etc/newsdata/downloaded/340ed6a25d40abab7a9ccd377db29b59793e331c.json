It\u2019s come a long way: As it enters its 14th season on FXX, it will eventually become the longest-running live-action sitcom in terms of seasons in TV history. This achievement becomes even more incredible when considering the show\u2019s conceit: Five of the most morally repugnant people on the face of the planet lie, cheat, steal, and behave with apathy toward the general world to their own consistent detriment. The amoral position they take has led many to compare the show to Seinfeld \u2014 but Seinfeld never had its characters get addicted to crack, file false police reports, threaten people at gunpoint, or intentionally sell alcohol to minors.\n\nBut Always Sunny transcends edgelord status by way of how strangely endearing its collection of miscreants have become over the years \u2014 no doubt due to the performances of Day (Charlie), Glenn Howerton (Dennis), Kaitlin Olson (Dee), Rob McElhenney (Mac), and most infamously, Danny DeVito (Frank), who has practically become the show\u2019s unofficial avatar since being introduced in its second season. Even more impressively, the show has constructed the type of world-building lore that rivals the MCU, with myriad secondary characters and ongoing plotlines that longtime viewers revel in.\n\nWith a whopping 13 seasons and 139 episodes to its name, and the 13th season kicking off this week, getting into Always Sunny is a bit daunting, even at the show\u2019s most accessible moments. So here\u2019s a ranking of every episode in the series to help separate the wheat from the chaff. We took into consideration general quality \u2014 how funny and well-structured every episode is \u2014 as well as times that the show went far beyond pushing boundaries into the realm of flat-out offensiveness. (One note for you number freaks: We combined two-parters into one episode for the sake of keeping narratives tidy.) Away we go.\n\n139. \u201cFrank\u2019s Brother\u201d (Season 7, Episode 5)\n\nAn atrocious episode that counts as the show\u2019s worst to date, inarguably. Flashback-centric episodes have never quite suited Always Sunny, and that goes quadruple for this one, which introduces us to Frank\u2019s brother Gino and takes the audience on a dreadful trip down memory lane. Which one will end up with their past paramour Shadynasty (pronounced Sha-Dynasty) at the end of the episode? More importantly, who cares? Clearly not the people behind the show itself, who never bothered to return to this plotline again \u2014 notable for a show that loves to return to past plotlines.\n\n138. \u201cThe Gang Turns Black\u201d (Season 12, Episode 1)\n\nAlways Sunny more often than not falters when attempting relevant social commentary \u2014 an increasingly frequent occurrence in recent seasons. This musical episode, featuring the gang accidentally \u201cbecoming black\u201d after a power surge while watching The Wiz, attempts a few half-hearted observations about race, but ultimately doesn\u2019t add up to much. (Points, I guess, for resisting the urge to employ blackface as part of this episode\u2019s conceit \u2014 it\u2019s a well that the show has returned to now and again and has seldom drawn anything potent from.)\n\n137. \u201cThe Gang Solves the North Korea Situation\u201d (Season 3, Episode 6)\n\nRough episode, man. Let\u2019s just say that the Kim Jong-il\u2013impersonating owner of the Korean restaurant that attracts the gang\u2019s ire hasn\u2019t aged well \u2014 not to mention Charlie\u2019s questionable relationship with a preteen worker at the restaurant, an extended gag that never quite lands. It\u2019s one of a few episodes in which Always Sunny\u2019s attempt at highlighting the gang\u2019s racism just comes across as, well, racist.\n\n136. \u201cThe Gang Cracks the Liberty Bell\u201d (Season 4, Episode 11)\n\nAn imagined-history episode retold by Mac, Charlie, and Dennis as they attempt to acquire historical-site status for Paddy\u2019s. Retrofitting Always Sunny\u2019s \u201cthing\u201d to Revolutionary War\u2013era America works about as well as it sounds. This mediocre glimpse at a fictional past deserves to be forgotten completely.\n\n135. \u201cCharlie and Dee Find Love\u201d (Season 8, Episode 4)\n\nTruly bizarre and ironic that the episode in which Charlie and Dee actually (and very briefly) find love with each other(!), \u201cThe Gang Misses the Boat,\u201d is far funnier and more effective than this extremely forgettable episode in which our titular pair falls in love with a pair of rich-dick siblings. Notable for a pre-fame guest appearance by Alexandra Daddario, and not much else.\n\n134. \u201cMac is a Serial Killer\u201d (Season 3, Episode 10)\n\nNothing quite lands in this one, in which the gang suspects that Mac\u2019s shady behavior means that he\u2019s the serial killer that\u2019s on the loose in Philly. Of course he\u2019s not; he\u2019s been secretly dating Carmen, whom the gang offensively refers to as \u201cthe tranny\u201d as they dwell on the details of their sex life. (In later seasons, the gang is written to largely be more tolerant toward LGBTQ characters \u2014 Mac\u2019s own self-hating homophobia aside \u2014 but \u201ctolerance\u201d is pretty much the high bar they aim to reach and nothing more.)\n\n133. \u201cDennis Looks Like a Registered Sex Offender\u201d (Season 3, Episode 11)\n\nA decent concept totally devalued by the fact that Dennis is a sex offender \u2014 and, as revealed by later episode \u201cReynolds vs. Reynolds: The Cereal Defense,\u201d has multiple bench warrants for sexual assault filed against him. Also, let\u2019s not forget his statutory-rape charge revealed in \u201cThe Gang Runs for Office\u201d! Dennis Reynolds: bad guy.\n\n132. \u201cThe Gang Gets Whacked\u201d (Season 3, Episodes 12 and 13)\n\nSome early tonal inconsistency in this mostly blah two-parter, in which Frank expresses aversion both to spending money to get the gang out of a jam and engaging in scumbagish behavior like selling drugs. The Dennis-as-sex-worker B-plot is more capably put to work in the season 12 episode \u201cPTSDee,\u201d but not by much.\n\n131. \u201cDennis\u2019 Double Life\u201d (Season 12, Episode 10)\n\nEffectively a way to potentially write off Dennis in the face of Howerton\u2019s role on the still-going NBC comedy AP Bio, \u201cDennis\u2019 Double Life\u201d feels tossed-off. (Don\u2019t worry, Howerton will reportedly recur as Dennis in the upcoming 13th season.) Not much makes sense in this episode as the gang scrambles to help Dennis create a cover story to avoid the paternity resulting from \u201cThe Gang Beats Boggs.\u201d Proof that even 12 seasons in, Always Sunny can\u2019t force zaniness.\n\n130. \u201cThe High School Reunion\u201d (Season 7, Episodes 12 and 13)\n\nAnother dull two-parter, marked only by the revelation that Mac\u2019s real name is Ronald McDonald (really!). Some necessary myth-killing here regarding Dennis\u2019s high-school stature as a \u201cgolden god,\u201d but nothing about this episode feels quite right \u2014 evidence, perhaps, that the gang\u2019s unbridled cruelty is most effective when their targets are those who don\u2019t actually deserve it.\n\n129. \u201cThe Gang Spies Like U.S.\u201d (Season 10, Episode 5)\n\nUgh. An entire B-plot centering around the double entendre of the phrase \u201ccream pie\u201d? Thinly veiled Asian stereotypes? A nonsensical main plot that barely sputters to a close? Not even multiple trips to Guigino\u2019s (featuring everyone\u2019s favorite waiter, of course) can save this dismal late-series episode.\n\n128. \u201cDennis and Dee Get a New Dad\u201d (Season 2, Episode 10)\n\nAn episode centered around Frank\u2019s false paternity of Dennis and Dee, as well as the reveal of their actual birth father Bruce Mathis, who\u2019s played by Stephen Collins. If you don\u2019t understand why that alone automatically makes this episode lower-ranked, watch Bruce sing about loving children, and then just do a cursory Google search of Stephen Collins. Yeah. Pretty hard to watch. On the relative plus side: the additional (and still unresolved) revelation that Frank might be Charlie\u2019s long-lost father.\n\n127. \u201cThe Gang Beats Boggs\u201d (Season 10, Episode 1)\n\nThe gang attempting to beat Wade Boggs\u2019s long-legendary record for the most beers allegedly drank on a single cross-country flight is a novelty in itself, but mainly a little too on the nose. A thoroughly unmemorable episode that nonetheless is essential to Always Sunny lore, setting off a chain of events that brings us to where the 13th season is about to leave off.\n\n126. \u201cThe Gang Makes Lethal Weapon 6\u201d (Season 9, Episode 9)\n\nOy, a Lethal Weapon episode. More blackface and, most dismayingly, more attempts to create a proper Lethal Weapon sequel (this time, a sequel to the gang\u2019s own Lethal Weapon 5, which was first introduced in \u201cDee Reynolds: Shaping America\u2019s Youth\u201d). If the potential investors feel exasperated being made to watch the gang\u2019s latest filmic attempt, imagine how the audience feels.\n\n125. \u201cMac Fights Gay Marriage\u201d (Season 6, Episode 1)\n\nSet aside the show\u2019s eventual reveal that Mac is gay for the sake of taking this episode into fair consideration; after all, his sexual orientation may have been faintly telegraphed from the very beginning of the series, but said telegraphing only becomes evident in retrospect. Mac\u2019s relationship with Carmen was one of the show\u2019s most tone-deaf plotlines in its early years (particularly, as noted above, in its insistence in referring to the female-identifying Carmen as \u201cthe tranny\u201d), and even though Mac\u2019s crusade against gay marriage after discovering that Carmen\u2019s engaged is supposed to shine a light on his own ignorance, the plotline itself ends up coming across as ignorant. A notable episode for introducing Bill and Maureen Ponderosa into the romantic lives of Dee and Dennis, respectively \u2014 two more recurring threads that the show never manages to make truly compelling.\n\n124. \u201cThe Gang Goes to Hell\u201d (Season 11, Episodes 9 and 10)\n\nA return to form of sorts, although not in the way you\u2019d think: This two-parter (two-parters on this show! Never good!) is a hell (ahem) of a red herring that, for its majority, suggests the gang has died on a sunken cruise ship and is currently facing judgment for their many, many misdeeds. It\u2019s a conceit that feels directly ripped off from Curb Your Enthusiasm\u2019s fifth-season finale \u201cThe End,\u201d which Always Sunny often evoked in its earlier seasons \u2014 but unlike Larry David\u2019s own divine encounter, \u201cThe Gang Goes to Hell\u201d ends with a thoroughly unsatisfying resolution, a wet blanket of a conclusion that\u2019s as sopping as the gang\u2019s clothes after they\u2019re pulled out of the ship itself.\n\n123. \u201cGun Fever\u201d (Season 1, Episode 5)\n\nA slight episode that\u2019s weird to watch in light of the show\u2019s current state; the novelty of the gang becoming obsessed with owning a gun doesn\u2019t pack as much effectiveness when considering how frequently Frank waves his own firearm around after his introduction in the show\u2019s second season. (Considering how unlucky in love she is, too, it\u2019s similarly out of character for Dee to enjoy something of a stable relationship \u2014 that is, until the episode\u2019s explosive conclusion.)\n\n122. \u201cThe Gang Gets Extreme: Home Makeover Edition\u201d (Season 4, Episode 12)\n\nBlink and you\u2019ll miss this cameo from Retta of Parks and Recreation fame as an employee in a home-improvement store. It\u2019s perhaps the only notable element of this episode, which finds the gang turning a home-makeover attempt into a home invasion and indulging in some ugly stereotypes against Hispanic people in the process.\n\n121. \u201cMac\u2019s Banging the Waitress\u201d (Season 4, Episode 4)\n\nThe only episode that doesn\u2019t feature Dee! It suffers as a result, as the ultracomplicated plotline involving Mac, Charlie, Dennis, the Waitress, and multiple sex tapes fails to land. The episode\u2019s faults speak to just how strong the show is when the full ensemble cast is present. Also of note: One of a few early episodes hinting at the full reveal of Mac\u2019s identifying as queer a whole eight seasons later.\n\n120. \u201cMac and Charlie Die\u201d (Season 4, Episodes 5 and 6)\n\nThis two-parter falls victim to the same issues that plague the show\u2019s other two-parters \u2014 poor pacing, useless filler, an abundance of useless B-plot \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t help that its death-faking focus centers on Mac\u2019s dad, one of several secondary characters in Always Sunny\u2019s lineage that never quite seem to land comedically.\n\n119. \u201cThe Gang Tends Bar\u201d (Season 12, Episode 8)\n\nA relatively shiftless episode about what happens when Dennis tries to make the gang work an entire shift at the bar to no avail. This conceit \u2014 what happens when the bar\u2019s actually successful? \u2014 worked a lot better in the far, far superior \u201cThe Gang Group Dates,\u201d and the episode serves as a lesson in itself: Not even a rocket launcher can make a boring plotline interesting.\n\n118. \u201cMac\u2019s Mom Burns Her House Down\u201d (Season 6, Episode 6)\n\nA purely functional episode in hindsight, leading the way for multiple instances of Mac and Charlie\u2019s moms engaging in their own sordid schemes (\u201cCharlie\u2019s Mom Has Cancer\u201d) or being the focal point of one of the gang\u2019s own (\u201cOld Lady House: A Situation Comedy\u201d).\n\n117. \u201cMac Day\u201d (Season 9, Episode 5)\n\nWhat should\u2019ve been an instant-classic conceit \u2014 every member of the gang gets their own day to do whatever they want, and Mac\u2019s day is the most insufferable of them all \u2014 is mostly suffocated by a charmless Seann William Scott guest spot as Mac\u2019s cooler cousin, as well as the fact that Mac-centric episodes can prove a little overbearing. More proof that the show fires on all cylinders when achieving a perfect balance between plotting.\n\n116. \u201cThe Gang Exploits a Miracle\u201d (Season 2, Episode 7)\n\nThe first episode to introduce Rickety Cricket, the most misfortunate of the secondary characters that orbit Always Sunny\u2019s universe \u2014 as well as a B-plot that provides early evidence of how far Dennis will go to maintain his supposed good looks. Otherwise, the fake-miracle exploit that the gang centers around is weak tea among Always Sunny\u2019s stronger amoralistic brews.\n\n115. \u201cMaking Dennis Reynolds a Murderer\u201d (Season 12, Episode 5)\n\nThe conceit of this episode is all in the title, but the concept fails to land any decent jokes beyond Frank\u2019s The Jinx\u2013mirroring hot-mic situation. At least it finally concludes the long-running, long-dull Maureen Ponderosa plotline (albeit in a ridiculously grisly fashion).\n\n114. \u201cWho Got Dee Pregnant?\u201d (Season 6, Episode 7)\n\nOr, \u201cThe Gang Gets Rashomon,\u201d as Dee sends the rest of them into a panic by intimating that one of them impregnated her and everyone seems to remember the besotted night in question differently. The outcome has no bearing on the future of the series as a whole, and you could say the same about this forgettable episode, too.\n\n113. \u201cMac Bangs Dennis\u2019 Mom\u201d (Season 2, Episode 4)\n\nAn overly complicated and poorly plotted mess of an episode that starts with \u2026 well, just look at the title; it ends with the Waitress committing one of many acts that devastates the forever stalker-y Charlie. The gang often schemes against each other to great effect, but something about Charlie capably masterminding so many different schemes here just doesn\u2019t feel right from a character-trait perspective \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t prove that funny to watch either.\n\n112. \u201cA Very Sunny Christmas\u201d (Season 6, Episodes 13 and 14)\n\nI considered excluding this episode on the technicality that it began as a straight-to-DVD special, but FX did eventually air it as part of the sixth season, so it technically counts. Unfortunately, its extended length just means plenty of bloat, including several Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\u2013inspired claymation segments and go-nowhere plotlines that don\u2019t add much lore to the show. Points only for the sequence in which Frank, totally nude, cuts himself out of a leather couch and horrifies an unsuspecting office party.\n\n111. \u201cThe Gang Wins the Big Game\u201d (Season 13, Episode 9)\n\nA less-satisfying rejoinder to \u201cCharlie\u2019s Home Alone\u201d that attempts to capture the euphoria of the Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl win, with little of the hilarity the show\u2019s known for. It\u2019s a slight, forgettable episode that unintentionally points out the show\u2019s uneven track record with sports-related eps, from the sublime (\u201cThe Gang Gets Invincible\u201d) to the dull (\u201cThe World Series Defense\u201d).\n\n110. \u201cThe Gang Makes Paddy\u2019s Great Again\u201d (Season 13, Episode 1)\n\nPrevious attempts to introduce new members of the gang into the Sunny universe (Schmitty, we hardly knew ye) never really worked comedically, and this season opener featuring Mindy Kaling as a trigger-the-libs type with one MAGA scheme to rule them all is no exception. Her plotline is mostly window dressing to introduce new conceits (hello, newly ripped Mac!) and give now-recurring character Dennis some time off, as Glenn Howerton was splitting his time between Sunny and the NBC sitcom A.P. Bio. Suffice it to say, it\u2019s a breath of fresh air when Dennis returns at the episode\u2019s end, effectively relieving Kaling of her short-lived duties.\n\n109. \u201cThe World Series Defense\u201d (Season 5, Episode 6)\n\nThe tale that the gang spins to get out of a simple parking ticket intentionally runs out of steam by the end of this episode \u2014 and the episode does so in turn, yet another instance in which a flashback-centric episode misses the mark. The only highlight here is Frank, Mac, and Dee attempting to suffer through a pesticide-infested apartment, a humorous gag that honestly could\u2019ve worked instead as the axis of a superior episode.\n\n108. \u201cThe Gang Finds a Dead Guy\u201d (Season 1, Episode 6)\n\nThe first time that the plotline of Dee and Dennis\u2019s Nazi grandfather is introduced \u2014 a path for the show that never quite bears comic fruit, a critique that could be applied to this episode as a whole. Watching Charlie spray down the bar after the titular deceased is carted out is funny enough, but there\u2019s something icky about watching Dennis succeed in romancing his granddaughter \u2014 beyond the fact that Dennis is plenty icky to begin with.\n\n107. \u201cPsycho Pete Returns\u201d (Season 10, Episode 3)\n\nNotable only for the relative closure provided for Frank\u2019s \u201cfrog kid\u201d story that began with the classic season-eight episode \u201cThe Gang Gets Analyzed.\u201d Otherwise, a bummer of an installment about mental-health panic that doesn\u2019t do much with its main conceit.\n\n106. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Paddy\u2019s Billboard Model Contest\u201d (Season 4, Episode 3)\n\nA relative mess of an episode centered around the titular contest, attempts to imitate various strains of reality TV, and Charlie and Dee\u2019s failed viral-video venture that also introduces Dee\u2019s, yep, blackface-reliant \u201cMartina Martinez\u201d character. A blatantly offensive plot wrinkle (and, yes, I know, that\u2019s the point) that is more effectively utilized in the masterful \u201cThe Gang Recycles Their Trash.\u201d\n\n105. \u201cThe Gang Gets a New Member\u201d (Season 6, Episode 8)\n\nThe first part of the for-all-intents-and-purposes two-parter concluded by \u201cDee Reynolds: Shaping America\u2019s Youth,\u201d this episode features Jason Sudeikis guesting as former pal Schmitty, whose presence irks Charlie to the point that he takes his janitorial skills elsewhere. Not so coincidentally, that \u201celsewhere\u201d turns out to be a nearby high school where Dee is also holed up, as she visits her former drama teacher in an attempt to recapture her youthful energy. The follow-up ep here is slightly better, but both ultimately shake up the show\u2019s chemistry in an unwelcome way.\n\n104. \u201cReynolds vs. Reynolds: The Cereal Defense\u201d (Season 8, Episode 10)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this one\u2019s notable for the revelation that Dennis faces multiple bench warrants for sexual assault. (Very unsurprising, considering his conduct throughout the entirety of the show.) Holding a trial to decide who\u2019s responsible for Frank and Dennis\u2019s car collision is inspired as a concept, but in practice this episode declines into tedium the moment Mac steers the proceedings toward a dull debate on evolution.\n\n103. \u201cThe Gang Hits the Slopes\u201d (Season 11, Episode 3)\n\nQuite possibly the most bizarrely specific episode the show has put to tape, \u201cThe Gang Hits the Slopes\u201d is both parody of and tribute to the unseen (for good reason) 1991 comedy Ski School, going as far as to cast that film\u2019s star, Dean Cameron, as the pervy sexual deviant Drisko. (To the people intimating that this episode was actually a spoof of Hot Dog \u2026 the Movie \u2014 I know, I\u2019m disappointed, too.) Funny idea, not so funny of an episode.\n\n102. \u201cChardee MacDennis 2: Electric Boogaloo\u201d (Season 11, Episode 1)\n\nOne of Always Sunny\u2019s strengths is its ability to revive plotlines or straight-up lift previously used conceits from earlier seasons while breathing new life into them. This sequel to \u201cChardee MacDennis: the Game of Games\u201d isn\u2019t an instance of either, adding little to that classic episode\u2019s anything-goes brilliance beyond a grisly, Saw-esque third act that comes across as total overkill.\n\n101. \u201cDee Reynolds: Shaping America\u2019s Youth\u201d (Season 6, Episode 9)\n\nThis episode\u2019s blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it cameo comes from Paul Walter Hauser, who would later find relative fame as Tonya Harding\u2019s \u201cbodyguard\u201d in last year\u2019s I, Tonya. His turn as a high-school juggalo that Charlie takes under his wing is strange and funny, and said plotline is certainly stronger than the first emergence of a recurring thread in which the gang attempts to make sequels to the Lethal Weapon franchise \u2014 one of the most boring and blatantly offensive beats the show likes to return to.\n\n100. \u201cMac and Dennis: Manhunters\u201d (Season 4, Episode 1)\n\nDavid Hornsby\u2019s Rickety Cricket is one of Always Sunny\u2019s most treasured secondary characters, but there\u2019s a reason the show eventually ditched his perpetual victimhood-by-teabagging from Mac and Dennis: It\u2019s a one-note joke, and this mediocre episode makes that more than apparent. Charlie and Dee\u2019s B-plot centered around accidental cannibalism (or is it?!) is similarly uninspired.\n\n99. \u201cMac Kills His Dad\u201d (Season 10, Episode 7)\n\nThe final time we see Mac\u2019s dad to date, and good riddance \u2014 the character never quite worked in the show, even considering his importance in Mac\u2019s own fucked-up lineage. We also learn that Maureen Ponderosa\u2019s transitioning into life as a cat, another uninspired plotline that is mercifully resolved in \u201cMaking Dennis Reynolds a Murderer.\u201d\n\n98. \u201cThe Gang Gets Held Hostage\u201d (Season 3, Episode 4)\n\nMcPoyle-centric plotlines are 50/50 when they land, and this episode lands squarely on the not-that-funny side of things. Fun fact about this one: Charlie\u2019s \u201cbad room\u201d \u2014 specifically, a place in the bar where he goes to be angry and break bottles \u2014 is introduced in this episode and never brought up again, a rare instance in Always Sunny lore of a new wrinkle in the gang\u2019s universe being introduced and promptly discarded.\n\n97. \u201cBeing Frank\u201d (Season 11, Episode 6)\n\nA Hardcore Henry/\u201cSmack My Bitch Up\u201d\u2013esque POV episode attempting to show a day in the life of Frank\u2019s twisted mind. It\u2019s a clever conceit that nonetheless doesn\u2019t rise above the gag itself, although it does mark one of the few humorous appearances from Bill Ponderosa.\n\n96. \u201cThe Maureen Ponderosa Wedding Massacre\u201d (Season 8, Episode 3)\n\nThe highly stylized, genre-ripping version of Always Sunny almost never works, and this episode is testament to that. The often delightfully icky McPoyle family\u2019s gimmick is wasted on the dull drabness of the continuing Ponderosa plotline, but this episode at least sets up the main conflict for the superior season 11 episode \u201cMcPoyle vs. Ponderosa: the Trial of the Century.\u201d\n\n95. \u201cThe Great Recession\u201d (Season 5, Episode 3)\n\nA so-so attempt at topicality (never the show\u2019s strong suit) that includes Frank attempting suicide several times, Charlie attempting to sell sewage-raised crabs, and Mac and Dennis attempting to mirror Dave & Buster\u2019s business model in their own besotted, idiotic way. Despite the dire straits the gang finds itself in throughout, everything basically resets at the end of the episode \u2014 a fitting conclusion for a slight installment.\n\n94. \u201cDennis and Dee\u2019s Mom Is Dead\u201d (Season 3, Episode 3)\n\nSome deadweight is cast off here: the titular matriarch, whose character was never a good fit on the show\u2019s earlier episodes, and Bruce Mathis (again, the less Stephen Collins, the better). A fairly weak episode that nonetheless introduces the Lawyer to the Always Sunny universe \u2014 inarguably the show\u2019s most memorable secondary character not named Rickety Cricket.\n\n93. \u201cDennis Gets Divorced\u201d (Season 6, Episode 2)\n\nEffectively an episode to undo all the marrying (or, in Dee\u2019s case, marriage-ruining) that took place during \u201cMac Fights Gay Marriage.\u201d Ranked slightly higher than that episode, if only because the conclusion of the dual Ponderosa plots gives the audience a respite from their characters for a season or so.\n\n92. \u201cFlowers for Charlie\u201d (Season 9, Episode 8)\n\nFun fact: This episode was directed by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, whom you might recognize as the showrunners of Game of Thrones. Obviously, Always Sunny is not Game of Thrones, and this obvious Flowers for Algernon riff isn\u2019t even that good of an Always Sunny episode, even if there\u2019s some humor in watching Dee get her hand stuck in a hole while huffing gas and trying to catch a rat.\n\n91. \u201cCharlie Got Molested\u201d (Season 1, Episode 7)\n\nMost memorable for the introduction of Charlie\u2019s creepy, hands-obsessed Uncle Jack, as well as the pivotal scene in which Charlie\u2019s mom asks him to \u201cshow me on the doll where\u201d the alleged molester touched him. Otherwise, if you\u2019re a longtime fan who hasn\u2019t watched this episode in a while, it probably hasn\u2019t held up as well as you think: Besides the early days hobbling, something rings false about Charlie being able to capably dismantle the McPoyles\u2019 extortion scheme.\n\n90. \u201cThe Gang Goes Jihad\u201d (Season 2, Episode 2)\n\nAlways Sunny has plenty of praiseworthy one-off characters, but Ari Frankel \u2014 then-paramour of Dennis and Dee\u2019s mother, Barbara Reynolds, as well as the businessman who puts Paddy\u2019s future into temporary jeopardy \u2014 is portrayed stultifyingly by Josh Stamberg, who has trouble falling into the show\u2019s offbeat and befuddled rhythm. Worth mentioning: the titular and supposed flaming-bag-of-poop \u201cjihad,\u201d which sets off a plotline that resolves itself in the later season-two episode \u201cThe Gang Gives Back.\u201d\n\n89. \u201cPop-Pop: the Final Solution\u201d (Season 8, Episode 1)\n\nA rejoinder to the plotline established in \u201cThe Gang Finds a Dead Guy\u201d that slightly excels its predecessor solely due to a mildly funny check-in with Rickety Cricket, who initially tries to pass himself off as a \u201cdog executioner\u201d at the local kennel before revealing the latest sad, dog-shit-smeared turn his life has taken.\n\n88. \u201cThe Gang Gets New Wheels\u201d (Season 13, Episode 5)\n\nSunny has typically found its greatest success when sending its characters out into the world to cause careless, nonsensical mayhem. So why does this episode fall flat? Part of its failure is that the central plot \u2014 Dennis attempting to find a suitable replacement for his Range Rover \u2014 feels like a retread of the far-superior episode \u201cThe Gang Misses the Boat.\u201d More important, and it hurts a little to say this, \u201cThe Gang Gets New Wheels\u201d is representative of the lazy writing and missed punch lines that plague season 13, the first season of which suggests that Sunny\u2019s own gas tank might be close to running on empty.\n\n87. \u201cCharlie Catches a Leprechaun\u201d (Season 11, Episode 8)\n\nIgnore the titular scheme \u2014 it\u2019s boring and cheap, and not as funny as Dennis, Dee, and Frank\u2019s attempt to bring Paddy\u2019s into modernity that turns into a catch-and-release mugging operation. But even that scheme feels a little played (see: \u201cBums: Making a Mess All Over the City\u201d), an unintentional whiff of repetitiveness from a show that otherwise makes great hay out of its past elsewhere.\n\n86. \u201cCharlie Wants an Abortion\u201d (Season 1, Episode 2)\n\nCharlie\u2019s attempt to pretend he\u2019s part of the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America program to impress the Waitress backfires horribly, and the brat of a child he pretends to mentor (Tommy, the son of Charlie\u2019s high-school ex-girlfriend) is the shining star of this episode. The B-plot involving Dennis\u2019s attempts to pick up women at an abortion-clinic protest \u2014 only to literally get stuck on the fence between the two sides of the issue \u2014 is a little too Curb Your Enthusiasm-y, as well as an indication that the show was still finding its own voice in the first season.\n\n85. \u201cBums: Making a Mess All Over the City\u201d (Season 3, Episode 14)\n\nCharlie\u2019s Serpico impression is medium-level inspired, as is Frank\u2019s scheme to dress up like a cop to get free hot dogs (and, along with Dennis, occasionally mug everyday citizens). But what elevates \u201cBums: Making a Mess All Over the City\u201d beyond its sorta-dull plotting is the episode\u2019s extremely short cold opening, which features a homeless man masturbating with passion as the gang horrifyingly watches on. Making a mess all over the city, indeed.\n\n84. \u201cPaddy\u2019s Pub: Home of the Original Kitten Mittens\u201d (Season 5, Episode 8)\n\nA much-mentioned episode (how can you not bring up the mere existence of kitten mittens?) that is nonetheless not as strong as its reputation suggests. More notable for the \u201cdick towel\u201d conceit that sets up the brilliant \u201cThe Gang Buys a Boat.\u201d\n\n83. \u201cThe Gang Escapes\u201d (Season 13, Episode 2)\n\nThe titular escape-room conceit isn\u2019t nearly as funny as Dee\u2019s disturbing discovery of Dennis\u2019s own private escape room, adding another extremely off-putting element to the sexual-predator story line. But even that amusing B plot feels a little too convoluted, adding to the Dennis-is-a-monster narrative in an unnecessary way and suggesting that the narrative, as it currently stands, doesn\u2019t need much added to it anyway.\n\n82. \u201cHundred Dollar Baby\u201d (Season 2, Episode 5)\n\nThis one suffers from the poor pacing that occasionally plagues Always Sunny\u2019s earlier seasons, but (no spoilers!) the titular homage paid toward Clint Eastwood\u2019s classic 2004 film is hilariously effective (and brutal) in its final moments.\n\n81. \u201cGun Fever Too: Still Hot\u201d (Season 9, Episode 2)\n\nA spiritual sequel to the first-season episode \u201cGun Fever\u201d that slightly ups its predecessor with Dennis and Dee\u2019s deranged plotline involving multiple attempts to purchase guns, including the reveal that Dee was institutionalized for setting her roommate on fire in college. Otherwise, a sorta-stale revival of a stale concept.\n\n80. \u201cThe Gang Saves the Day\u201d (Season 9, Episode 6)\n\nThe gang\u2019s at a convenience store when a robbery breaks out, which causes them to briefly fantasize in the moment: How would each of them save the day, and what would happen afterward? Mac\u2019s dream sequence is the weak link here, with Dee\u2019s delusions of fame marking the episode\u2019s high point \u2014 while Charlie\u2019s Up-aping fantasy might actually bring a tear or two to your eyes (guilty, and I\u2019ve seen it multiple times), just like the Pixar classic itself.\n\n79. \u201cThe Gang Finds a Dumpster Baby\u201d (Season 3, Episode 1)\n\nCharlie\u2019s descent into madness after finding out he survived his mother\u2019s abortion attempt \u2014 never mind the still-unanswered question of whether or not Frank is his real father \u2014 is one of many great Peak Charlie moments. But there are a few false notes struck in this episode, more indicative of the show not yet hitting the groove it would establish in later seasons: watching Dennis triumph over a group of hippies is humorous but feels wrong \u2014 we don\u2019t want to see Dennis win! He\u2019s a monster! Furthermore, even though Mac and Dee\u2019s attempts to raise the titular dumpster baby (\u201cD.B.\u201d for short) are enjoyable, a scene with a child casting agent who emphasizes that white children don\u2019t \u201csell\u201d in the entertainment industry undercuts an unspoken rule of Always Sunny: The characters that interact with the gang are rarely supposed to be as despicable as the gang themselves. (As evidenced later in the season, it\u2019s much funnier when said outliers out-ick the gang.)\n\n78. \u201cFrank Retires\u201d (Season 10, Episode 9)\n\nThe gang jockeying for power in the wake of Frank\u2019s sudden retirement isn\u2019t nearly as funny as what they do to Frank after he retires: specifically, siphoning massive amounts of blood from his body while he\u2019s sleeping for the sake of performing various blood tests. As far as Frank\u2019s-decomposing-body plotlines are concerned, \u201cSweet Dee Has a Heart Attack\u201d did it better \u2014 but Frank\u2019s pale, ghastly blood-lost look near the episode\u2019s end is plenty memorable regardless.\n\n77. \u201cHow Mac Got Fat\u201d (Season 7, Episode 10)\n\nHow did Mac get fat? McElhenney notoriously gained 60 pounds for season seven of Always Sunny, working with a nutritionist recommended by baseball player Chase Utley (who looms large in Mac\u2019s own idolatry and appeared as himself in \u201cThe Gang Gets Stranded in the Woods\u201d), but this episode finally offers the explanation of why the character chose to do this. As ever, the explanation isn\u2019t as funny as how we get to the explanation.\n\n76. \u201cThe Gang Does a Clip Show\u201d (Season 13, Episode 7)\n\nWhat starts out as your typical career-spanning clip-show format turns into something weirder and more metaphysical, a rare dip into magical realism for the Sunny gang. And perhaps the show rarely goes this route for good reason: Although \u201cThe Gang Does a Clip Show\u201d is a fine piece of loopy sorta-sci-fi, it doesn\u2019t quite work as a Sunny ep, and its ending \u2014 which, spoiler alert, is pretty much just the end of Inception, spinning top and all \u2014 lands with a soft thud.\n\n75. \u201cMac and Charlie Write a Movie\u201d (Season 5, Episode 11)\n\nDee\u2019s diva-like behavior on a M. Night Shyamalan movie set where she\u2019s merely a dialogue-free extra is Peak Dee \u2014 as is Dennis\u2019s concept for his own movie, which involves the type of graphic sex scenes not typically seen in the cinema outside of Gaspar No\u00e9 films. Mac and Charlie\u2019s subplot \u2014 in which they work on writing their own movie, of course \u2014 drags a bit, but the final shot of Frank ruining a take to eat some breakfast sausage makes up for it.\n\n74. \u201cDee Made a Smut Film\u201d (Season 11, Episode 4)\n\nFrank\u2019s \u201cOngo Gablogian\u201d art-deal alias is certainly funnier than the revelation that Dennis was raped at the age of 14 by school librarian Ms. Klinksy \u2014 a late-series plot point that is occasionally played for questionable laughs but offers a surprising amount of depth in regards to his own predatory character traits. But the real star of this episode is guest star Richard Grieco, who stars in Dee\u2019s ill-fated attempt to adapt Dennis\u2019s erotic memoirs into a feature film and, hilariously, can\u2019t stop eating seaweed (or chalk \u2014 it\u2019s a long story).\n\n73. \u201cFrank\u2019s Pretty Woman\u201d (Season 7, Episode 1)\n\n\u201cCan I offer you an egg in this trying time?\u201d Some of the weaker Always Sunny episodes can be saved by one perfect line of dialogue, and Frank offering a potential date his ovular obsession (after Charlie vomits fake blood capsules all over her, naturally) is certainly evidence of that. The scene where Frank\u2019s titular prostitute dies of an overdose in front of the gang is undoubtedly one of the show\u2019s bleakest moments, but it doesn\u2019t quite translate into the level of deranged hilarity they were clearly reaching for.\n\n72. \u201cCharlie Work\u201d (Season 10, Episode 4)\n\nDespite this mostly single-shot episode serving as a theoretical hat-tip to Birdman, \u201cCharlie Work\u201d was actually written and filmed before Birdman even saw release. The camera-trickiness of it all is commendable, and it\u2019s funny to experience the rare feeling of being one step removed from the central planning of one of the gang\u2019s schemes (chickens? Steaks? Airline miles?), but, ultimately, the audience isn\u2019t left too charmed.\n\n71. \u201cThe Gang Gets Racist\u201d (Season 1, Episode 1)\n\nThe first-ever episode of Always Sunny (if not the real first episode \u2014 more on that later) makes no bones about establishing the show\u2019s capacity to offend, from an A-plot centering around the gang\u2019s own racist tendencies to Mac\u2019s latent homophobia. As is the case from much of Always Sunny\u2019s first season, \u201cThe Gang Gets Racist\u201d feels like the work of a show finding its own voice, including moments of conversational awkwardness lifted from Curb Your Enthusiasm\u2019s improvisational framework. But it\u2019s also striking how many character traits are established here that have since become part of the show\u2019s core framework, from Dennis\u2019s pathological vaingloriousness to Charlie\u2019s over-the-top attempts to win over the waitress while stalking her. It\u2019s far from an essential \u2014 or even particularly enjoyable \u2014 episode, but it\u2019s impressive to witness in the rearview how much Always Sunny has stayed true to its roots even as it\u2019s added embellishment after embellishment.\n\n70. \u201cThe Gang Solves the Gas Crisis\u201d (Season 4, Episode 2)\n\nA minor episode that nonetheless carries major reverberations for future episodes: \u201cThe Gang Solves the Gas Crisis\u201d is essentially the blueprint for one of the show\u2019s finest achievements to date, the heavily meta \u201cThe Gang Recycles Their Trash.\u201d In another meta stroke, the stranger whose life the gang basically destroys after mistaking him for Dennis and Dee\u2019s birth father Bruce Mathis also reappears in the excellent \u201cThe Gang Squashes Their Beefs.\u201d (No word on if he survived that notoriously fiery episode, though.)\n\n69. \u201cA Cricket\u2019s Tale\u201d (Season 12, Episode 9)\n\nWhat if Rickety Cricket finally put down the pipe and made good? That\u2019s the anchor behind this episode, which takes place temporally during the same period as the superior \u201cPTSDee.\u201d While it doesn\u2019t quite match its episodic cousin in laughs, it certainly lives up to its depravity, as Cricket\u2019s love affair with a \u201cwoman\u201d (it\u2019s a dog) named Bell goes horrifyingly, disgustingly wrong.\n\n68. \u201cHero or Hate Crime?\u201d (Season 12, Episode 6)\n\n\u201cHero or Hate Crime?\u201d hinges around the owner of a winning lottery ticket, a falling piano, and a few offensive slurs. It\u2019s a bit mediocre overall, but the revelation of Dennis \u201cmaking deposits\u201d with a barely legal convenience-store employee is fairly humorous, in that any further exploration of Dennis\u2019s sexual depravity is often humorous.\n\n67. \u201cThe Gang Gets Quarantined\u201d (Season 9, Episode 7)\n\nThis episode reveals what any casual viewer of Always Sunny knew well before its ninth season: The gang has a drinking problem, and the only solution \u2026 is more drinking. This bottle episode isn\u2019t the most effective of the bunch, but the revelation that all they need to do to solve their flu-like symptoms is throw back some hair of the dog is as funny as it is obvious.\n\n66. \u201cCharlie Gets Crippled\u201d (Season 2, Episode 1)\n\nKeep your eyes peeled in this episode for a pre-fame cameo from none other than Tiffany Haddish, playing a dancer in the strip club that the gang occasionally frequents throughout the series. But \u201cCharlie Gets Crippled\u201d is most notable for introducing the incomparable Frank Reynolds (Danny DeVito), Dennis and Dee\u2019s sorta-father (it\u2019s complicated) and a character that not only altered the show\u2019s makeup but arguably added the final ingredient to make it the depraved, bizarre comedy powerhouse it stands as today. Also of note: a highly effective set piece in which, after Charlie\u2019s titular temporary injury, the gang takes a trip to the mall while pretending to be physically disabled \u2014 exactly the type of despicable behavior that Frank\u2019s mere presence elicits in future seasons.\n\n65. \u201cCharlie Has Cancer\u201d (Season 1, Episode 4)\n\nA little trivia: The conceit behind this episode\u2019s opening scene \u2014 in which Charlie tells Dennis he might have cancer, with Dennis being too preoccupied in trying to borrow a basketball from him to elicit any real sympathy \u2014 was actually the idea-germ that led McElhenney and Howerton to film the show\u2019s ultra-cheap pilot. (In said and unaired pilot, the basketball was actually a cup of sugar.) Anyway, spoiler alert: Charlie does not have cancer, and even though this episode drags as much as the first few seasons of Always Sunny tend to do, it\u2019s a funny and early taste of the gang\u2019s apathy and depravity.\n\n64. \u201cThe Gang Sells Out\u201d (Season 3, Episode 7)\n\nWhy would the waitress trust any of the gang enough to hire them at the chain restaurant she works at in this episode? In fairness, it\u2019s an early episode; there\u2019s still plenty of her trust to be abused. A funny (albeit not extremely memorable) episode that gives us an idea of what happens when the gang works at a real bar. (The answer: nothing good.)\n\n63. \u201cDee Gives Birth\u201d (Season 6, Episode 12)\n\nA perfectly fine episode that concludes the end of Dee\u2019s (and Olson\u2019s) pregnancy, as the rest of the gang scrambles to figure out who the father is \u2014 so they\u2019re not stuck taking care of the kid, naturally. Featuring a rare funny plotline involving Bill Ponderosa, as well as an extremely dark revelation regarding how Dee keeps the men in her life coming back for more.\n\n62. \u201cPaddy\u2019s Pub: The Worst Bar in Philadelphia\u201d (Season 4, Episode 8)\n\nOne of the only episodes after Frank\u2019s introduction not to feature the character, which explains why something feels a bit off in the accidental dual-kidnapping plot this episode centers around. A decent installment that nonetheless suffers a bit from the escalation of the gang\u2019s bad behavior not carrying maximum effectiveness.\n\n61. \u201cThe Gang Dances Their Asses Off\u201d (Season 3, Episode 15)\n\nCharlie\u2019s illiteracy fells the gang yet again, as he signs Paddy\u2019s Pub up for a dance competition without realizing that the prize is \u2026 sole ownership of Paddy\u2019s Pub. The Sklar brothers have a cameo in this episode, but don\u2019t let that dissuade you from enjoying this solid season-three ep, which is essential to Charlie lore in retrospect (the kid can really hold his drugs).\n\n60. \u201cUnderage Drinking: A National Concern\u201d (Season 1, Episode 3)\n\nOne of the first indications that the gang\u2019s sense of judgment is seriously off-balance: Not only do they open up Paddy\u2019s Pub to host a gaggle of drunk high-schoolers on a regular basis, but Dennis and Dee both start dating high-schoolers (they\u2019re 18, but still) as Charlie gets wrapped up in the attendant high-school drama. A solid early episode, bolstered by Mac\u2019s realization that nobody really ever likes him all that much.\n\n59. \u201cMcPoyle vs. Ponderosa: The Trial of the Century\u201d (Season 11, Episode 7)\n\nHey, look, a funny Ponderosa-centric episode! The resolution of the plotline kicked off in \u201cThe Maureen Ponderosa Wedding Massacre\u201d dives deep into the bizarre, hands-obsessed tendencies of Charlie\u2019s uncle Jack, as well as the ever-suffering lawyer\u2019s own personal pain caused by the gang\u2019s incessant troublemaking. Charlie\u2019s attempt to practice \u201cbird law\u201d is funnier than it should be, as is the gang\u2019s general unawareness of how being in court works, despite multiple episodes set within courtrooms.\n\n58. \u201cThe Gang Gets Stranded in the Woods\u201d (Season 6, Episode 11)\n\nA classic instance of Dennis trolling Mac in the finest, cruelest way possible, as a series of unfortunate events leads to Dennis finally playing catch with Chase Utley (Mac\u2019s stalkerish longtime dream) while Mac\u2019s left to contemplate eating rotted animals in the woods along with Frank and Dee. Guess who\u2019s the one who eats said rotted animals? (It ain\u2019t Dee.)\n\n57. \u201cThe Gang Runs for Office\u201d (Season 2, Episode 8)\n\n\u201cSo do!\u201d Charlie\u2019s illiterate campaign-commercial script for Dennis\u2019s failed comptroller run in this episode is the stuff of Always Sunny legend. A solid early-series episode on the strength of that plotline alone, even if the b-plots involving Mac, Frank, and Dee\u2019s failed attempts to solicit bribes from public officials and union bosses fall comparatively flat.\n\n56. \u201cThe Gang Gives Back\u201d (Season 2, Episode 6)\n\nThe resolution of the \u201cThe Gang Goes Jihad\u201d plotline outstrips its predecessor by leaning into their own capacity for horribleness, from the various acts of arguable child abuse committed by Dennis, Dee, Frank, and Mac as they coach children\u2019s basketball teams to fulfill their community service. Charlie getting caught drinking a beer in an AA meeting is memorable, but not as much as when he falls off the wagon (was he ever really on?) near the episode\u2019s end, drunkenly refereeing the Frank-fixed basketball game with pure comedic abandon.\n\n55. \u201cCharlie Goes America All Over Everybody\u2019s Ass\u201d (Season 2, Episode 9)\n\nCharlie lets loose his unforgettable rallying cry (\u201cROCK FLAG AN EAGLE!\u201d) while Dee gives acting another post-college try, and Mac, Frank, and Dennis turn Paddy\u2019s into a den of illegal activity \u2014 all in the name of freedom, of course. Some good Artemis material here, as well as a truly shocking ending that ranks up there with one of the grimmest kickers in the show\u2019s history.\n\n54. \u201cFrank Sets Sweet Dee on Fire\u201d (Season 3, Episode 8)\n\nThe title says it all, right? Well, it\u2019s not entirely true anyway: technically, Frank, Charlie, and Mac all set Dee on fire \u2014 several times \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t get any less funny every time she\u2019s set ablaze as they try to attain public-access glory. Dennis and Dee eventually succeed where the other three fail, but not in the way they\u2019d like to. All I can say: It\u2019s diaper time.\n\n53. \u201cThe Gang Beats Boggs: Ladies Reboot\u201d (Season 13, Episode 3)\n\nAs mentioned in the title, it\u2019s a redo of \u201cThe Gang Beats Boggs\u201d with a majority of Sunny\u2019s female-identifying recurring and primary characters. The episode\u2019s main \u201clesson\u201d is that gender-focused reboots are unnecessary when compared to the pure power of original storytelling, which is fine, but it turns out that \u201cLadies Reboot\u201d actually fares a little better than its source material (especially the explosive final minutes \u2014 it\u2019s not for the squeamish).\n\n52. \u201cThe Gang Goes on Family Fight\u201d (Season 10, Episode 8)\n\nFrank\u2019s inexplicable embrace of Get on the Bus\u2019s \u201cShabooya roll call\u201d catchphrase emerges in this game show-centric episode, which also features Keegan-Michael Key\u2019s turn as an infuriated game show host and one of a few Dee-focused fart-centric gags. If you don\u2019t like this episode, you deserve to hear the buzzer that drives Dennis crazy for the rest of your life.\n\n51. \u201cPTSDee\u201d (Season 12, Episode 7)\n\nUndoubtedly the darkest scheme Dee\u2019s ever engaged in, as she turns the tables on a male stripper one-night-stand to show him what \u201crock bottom\u201d really feels like. Dennis and Charlie\u2019s \u201cDaddy and the Boy\u201d scheme never quite comes together, even as it\u2019s conceptually funny \u2014 but Dee\u2019s delightfully deranged actions in this episode more than make up for it.\n\n50. \u201cTime\u2019s Up for the Gang\u201d (Season 13, Episode 4)\n\nThis could\u2019ve been a disaster. Instead, \u201cTime\u2019s Up for the Gang,\u201d written by Community and Modern Family alum Megan Ganz, actually represents a rare direct hit when it comes to Sunny tackling hot-topic issues. The passage of time may prove otherwise, but in terms of quality season-13 topical episodes, it stands right behind \u201cThe Gang Solves the Bathroom Problem,\u201d though it\u2019s a game of inches (and, no, that\u2019s not a joke about Frank accidentally revealing his dong to the entire sexual-harassment seminar). No one is let off the hook by the end of this episode \u2014 especially Dee, who is revealed to be just as much of a monster as her brother. Who knew? (Well, we all had an inkling or two, but who\u2019s to say really?)\n\n49. \u201cSweet Dee\u2019s Dating a Retarded Person\u201d (Season 3, Episode 9)\n\nPolitical correctness of the title (and, hell, pretty much the entire episode) aside, this one\u2019s a pretty good early-series episode that offers a window into not only the gang\u2019s overall prejudice, but Dee\u2019s total lack of compassion and empathy. Most notable for the introduction of \u201cThe Nightman,\u201d Charlie\u2019s song about a man who enters him in the night and fills him up inside (it\u2019s not what you think though, he swears) that presages the epic \u201cThe Nightman Cometh.\u201d\n\n48. \u201cThe Gang Gets Trapped\u201d (Season 7, Episode 9)\n\nThere\u2019s a decent amount of funny stuff in this episode centered around breaking into \u2014 and, subsequently, getting stuck in \u2014 a family\u2019s house to steal an ancient vase, but Charlie and Mac\u2019s battle over who gets to eat a bag of chips is the crown jewel. A rare instance in which the audience is dropped in the middle of one of the gang\u2019s schemes, left to figure out what\u2019s happening as the episode progresses; the \u201creveal\u201d at the end feels cheap, though, and more than a little culturally insensitive.\n\n47. \u201cThe Gang Reignites the Rivalry\u201d (Season 5, Episode 12)\n\nA literally poisonous episode that finds the gang at their most vindictive \u2014 whether it be terrorizing diners at a restaurant, rigging a game of Flip Cup at a frat party, or cutting someone\u2019s shower curtain in half (Frank\u2019s idea \u2014 blame the Riterall). There are small details in many episodes of Always Sunny that are sometimes greater than the sum of the whole, and here it\u2019s Frank\u2019s obsession with wearing tight jeans; try not to laugh when he tells Dennis\u2019s errant fraternity to rip on him for \u201chow loose his jeans are.\u201d\n\n46. \u201cThe Gang Broke Dee\u201d (Season 9, Episode 1)\n\nWill Dee ever catch a break and realize her dreams of becoming a real-deal celebrity? This episode initially provides an answer \u2014 then, the rug is pulled from under the audience in its final minutes, in a not-totally-surprising but still cruelly clever way. This episode also provides another classic instance of Dennis descending into utter madness, despite his insistence that he\u2019s not mad \u2014 he actually finds the whole thing quite funny.\n\n45. \u201cCharlie Kelly: King of the Rats\u201d (Season 6, Episode 10)\n\nIt\u2019s Charlie\u2019s birthday! Or is it? Either way, the gang tries to get less selfish in attempting to give the poor guy a break from the rat-killing drudgery of his everyday life. Along with a memorable one-liner from a veritable extra (\u201cI\u2019m the guy who wipes down the loads\u201d), a rare happy ending for the show that doesn\u2019t feel out of place, as well as the introduction of Duncan, the bridge-dwelling lowlife that Frank calls his friend.\n\n44. \u201cDennis Reynolds: An Erotic Life\u201d (Season 4, Episode 9)\n\nI recently saw Sinbad at JFK wearing one hat on top of another hat. It was awesome \u2014 and rivaled his guest appearance on this episode, in which he and former Matchbox 20 front man Rob Thomas (you read that correctly) menace Dennis (or do they?) while he stays at a rehab facility (or does he?) to accurately re-create his falsified erotic memoirs. The B-plots involving Mac and Frank, and Charlie and Dee, walking in each other\u2019s respective shoes for a day aren\u2019t as funny, but we do learn how Frank and Charlie manage to get to sleep every night. (Hint: it involves a can of beer, a can of cat food \u2014 and some inhalants, of course.)\n\n43. \u201cThe Gang Goes to a Water Park\u201d (Season 12, Episode 2)\n\nDennis meets his scamming match in the form of the preteen Abby, whom he takes under his wing to show her the tools of his grifting trade. Dee and Mac\u2019s plotline in which they get stuck in a water park slide is as harrowing as it is hilarious, while Frank and Charlie\u2019s AIDS-riffing scheme to ride every slide at the titular water park feels like treading old ground \u2014 that is, until the grisly conclusion, which might make you cringe as it takes place.\n\n42. \u201cMac Finds His Pride\u201d (Season 13, Episode 10)\n\nIs this episode\u2019s placement controversially low? Will it eventually find a home in the annals of Sunny classics before it? I\u2019m not sure at the moment \u2014 even some of the strongest Sunny eps seem to get better with age, a curious trait for such an in-your-face show \u2014 but this season closer\u2019s sharp turn toward the sincere and heartfelt could scan as a bit disingenuous considering, oh, I don\u2019t know, the preceding 13 seasons of television. But does that even matter when considering the jaw-dropping final scene, one so fantastic and pitch-perfect in its execution that the notoriously sync-unfriendly Sigur R\u00f3s even lent one of their songs to it? Perhaps the greatest feat of \u201cMac Finds His Pride,\u201d especially following an unquestionably mediocre season of Sunny, is that it has even long-term viewers like me wondering where the show will go next.\n\n41. \u201cDennis and Dee Go on Welfare\u201d (Season 2, Episode 3)\n\nMac\u2019s scolding of Dennis and Dee\u2019s moral decline throughout this episode might seem incongruous with the way his character later develops (even if it speaks to his inherent conservative values) \u2014 but the escalation of the latter two\u2019s plotline, which results in a debilitating crack addiction and their eventual poverty, is Always Sunny at its finest. It\u2019s impressive, too, how the show continues to reference and play upon said addiction to this very day \u2014 one of many examples of Always Sunny\u2019s impressive world-building tendencies.\n\n40. \u201cThe Gang Solves the Bathroom Problem\u201d (Season 13, Episode 6)\n\nOne of season 13\u2019s finest episodes, a buffet of the gang\u2019s casual bigotry and the ways in which they contradict each other simply by existing. \u201cThe Gang Solves the Bathroom Problem\u201d is practically a how-to for constructing a highly effective episode of Sunny: Take a minor-but-bottle-episode-encouraging conflict, blow it out of proportion, lose the point several times over, add a few minor revelations that could be called into question anywhere from two episodes to two seasons from now, and build to a potentially chaotic conclusion before saying \u201cFuck it\u201d and heading to a Jimmy Buffett concert. Hey, if you like margaritas \u2026\n\n39. \u201cMac and Charlie: White Trash\u201d (Season 6, Episode 5)\n\nIt\u2019s a hot one, and the gang are dealing with being seven inches from the midday sun by finding a decent pool to cool off in. Of course, none of them truly understand the members-only concept of country clubs, which leads to a variety of ill-informed discussions about class and wealth \u2014 not to mention Charlie and Mac getting stuck in an abandoned pool and Frank firing up a game of \u201cGreased Watermelon\u201d at the public pool. Just make sure you wear your sneakers while playing.\n\n38. \u201cThe Gang Exploits the Mortgage Crisis\u201d (Season 5, Episode 1)\n\nThe platonic ideal of an Always Sunny episode: The gang splinters into two separate poorly drawn schemes, fail at both, attempt to combine said schemes into one mega-scheme, fail again, and end up throwing an impromptu pool party in a stranger\u2019s backyard. Come for the Melanie Lynskey cameo (as a vaguely annoyed, seriously concerned potential parent enlisting Dee\u2019s help as a surrogate), stay for Mac and Dennis\u2019s indelible Hugh Honey\u2013Vic Vinegar routine, as gleefully ridiculous of a conceit as any.\n\n37. \u201cThe Gang Gets Invincible\u201d (Season 3, Episode 2)\n\nGreen Man! Charlie\u2019s bodysuit-donning alter ego debuts in this delightfully bizarre episode that also features Frank shitting himself after taking too much acid (while Artemis watches, of course) and a McPoyles-centered plotline that ends with a (literal) bang. \u201cThe Gang Gets Invincible\u201d also marks the first appearance of The Cosby Show actor Geoffrey Owens as himself (kind of), as he unsuccessfully pretends to be Donovan McNabb to a gaggle of caped, hopeless Philadelphia Eagles tryout hopefuls; Owens also later appears in \u201cFrank\u2019s Pretty Woman,\u201d in which he claims to be Tiger Woods and, failing that, Don Cheadle.\n\n36. \u201cThe Gang Hits the Road\u201d (Season 5, Episode 2)\n\nThe first episode we learn that Charlie\u2019s never left Philadelphia (or eaten a pear, sticker or no sticker), canon information for Always Sunny that\u2019s played up for further laughs in later seasons. \u201cThe Gang Hits the Road\u201d delivers on its attempted road-trip premise with a hilarious reveal in the third act that involves the back of a trailer, a few wicker chairs, a grill, and not a whole lot of oxygen. (If that sounds complicated, trust me \u2014 you\u2019ll get it when you see it.) Also marks one of many, many times that Dee purchases a new car, only to have it destroyed by one (or all) of the gang.\n\n35. \u201cFrank Falls Out the Window\u201d (Season 11, Episode 2)\n\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of gore, this episode may not be for you: the resulting head wound from Frank\u2019s titular accident is plenty gross, even within the context of a show that\u2019s never been afraid to get gross. One of many dizzily meta episodes in the show\u2019s later seasons, as Charlie becomes convinced that the gang has time traveled a decade backward (they haven\u2019t) and, in the episode\u2019s highest highlight, interviews an amnesia-ridden Frank about his proclivity for eating cat food by any means necessary.\n\n34. \u201cCharlie\u2019s Mom Has Cancer\u201d (Season 8, Episode 6)\n\nSome Always Sunny guest spots land better than others, but Diddy\u2019s turn as a questionable medicine man obsessed with playing New Kids on the Block\u2019s \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d on bass is perfect in its offbeat and bizarre tone. Parts of this episode feel strangely somber \u2014 Charlie does love his mother, after all \u2014 but its conclusion, mirroring both \u201cCharlie Has Cancer\u201d and \u201cSweet Dee Gets Audited,\u201d is an impressive and hilarious twist that belies the been-down-this-road-before-ness of it all.\n\n33. \u201cThunder Gun Express\u201d (Season 7, Episode 11)\n\nThis 24-themed episode asks one question, and one question only: How will the gang make it to a showing of the new action film Thunder Gun Express? After all, he hangs dong in it! Mischief abounds, but the comic centerpiece is Frank\u2019s hijacking of a riverboat tour en route to the theater, resulting in an impromptu rundown of some of the show\u2019s highlights \u2014 as close as Always Sunny\u2019s come to a clip show, without getting all boring and corny about it.\n\n32. \u201cThe Aluminum Monster vs. Fatty Magoo\u201d (Season 3, Episode 5)\n\nJudy Greer\u2019s guest spot as Dee\u2019s former high-school misfit-in-arms made good is played with pitch-perfect indifference and disgust toward the gang\u2019s sweatshop-starting, dress-design-mangling attempts to assist Dee (accidentally or not) in trying to, in her paraphrased words, bring down the fatty of her past. One of a few early tastes of Dennis\u2019s vainglorious obsessiveness, as well as his distorted views on women\u2019s\u2019 body types (not to mention his own).\n\n31. \u201cThe Gang Squashes Their Beefs\u201d (Season 9, Episode 10)\n\nThe fire set in Dennis and Mac\u2019s apartment at the conclusion of this episode affects the show\u2019s plotting for seasons to come \u2014 not to mention the people trapped inside the fire! One of a few episodes in which the gang attempts, in vain, to become better people before settling on the fact that assholes \u2014 much like man-cheetahs \u2014 can\u2019t change their spots. Would we want them any other way?\n\n30. \u201cAss Kickers United: Mac and Charlie Join a Cult\u201d (Season 10, Episode 10)\n\nDennis has found a perfect and totally normal solution to prevent Mac from eating all of his Thin Mints: Start a cult. Dee and Frank get involved, and things invariably get messier; but before they set Mac and Dennis\u2019s apartment on fire (again), marvel with belly laughter at Frank\u2019s obsession with convincing one of the cult members to eat a literal \u201cshit sandwich.\u201d\n\n29. \u201cThe ANTI-Social Network\u201d (Season 7, Episode 8)\n\nA trip to a fancy gin bar causes the gang to have a realization: Paddy\u2019s kind of sucks, and it has no social-media presence to boot. Before they can get to work on that, though, they have to find the rude man who shush\u2019ed them at said gin bar and give him a piece of his mind. Some ruminations on exclusivity and the untruthfulness that social media allows (\u201cIs anybody online who they say they are?\u201d), as well as a classic homemade video (or, should we say, \u201cvirus video\u201d) courtesy of a very, very confused Frank.\n\n28. \u201cWolf Cola: A Public Relations Nightmare\u201d (Season 12, Episode 4)\n\nWhat\u2019s worse: actively procuring the sponsorship of Boko Haram for your cola drink, or hating dogs? That\u2019s just one of the questions this disastrously hilarious episode asks, which finds the gang juggling multiple public relations nightmares as a result of Frank\u2019s questionable business decisions. Includes the return of Mac and Charlie\u2019s \u201cFight Milk,\u201d, along with a new infomercial for the disgusting beverage that\u2019s funny enough to make you fly high as a crow.\n\n27. \u201cThe Waitress Is Getting Married\u201d (Season 5, Episode 5)\n\nRevenge heads (I know you\u2019re out there) will recognize a pre-Revenge Nick Wechsler as Brad, Dee\u2019s formerly acne-ridden high school ex who\u2019s marrying the titular waitress. It\u2019s easy to ignore how weird it feels to watch Charlie get revenge (see what I did there?) on Brad at the end of this episode \u2014 again, as much as we love the gang, they\u2019re not meant to succeed at nearly anything \u2014 but two moments in this episode are truly indelible: Dee\u2019s disastrous attempt at throwing the waitress a terrible bachelorette party (it makes more sense when you watch the episode), and Frank and Artemis\u2019s disgusting food fetish. What was he doing to himself with the onions at Wendy\u2019s? We\u2019ll never know.\n\n26. \u201cWho Pooped the Bed?\u201d (Season 4, Episode 7)\n\nWho did poop the bed? The answer isn\u2019t surprising (I won\u2019t spoil it), but this episode-length mystery investigates who pooped in Charlie and Frank\u2019s bed \u2014 not to mention the many strange details about Charlie and Frank sharing a bed \u2014 while Dee attempts to get Artemis and the waitress to be her gal pals, Sex and the City\u2013style. When that fails, Artemis attempts to solve the poop mystery herself \u2014 an early stroke of brilliance from a cherished secondary character.\n\n25. \u201cCharlie\u2019s Home Alone\u201d (Season 13, Episode 8)\n\nA delicious red herring of an episode that counts as Always Sunny\u2019s finest season-13 installment: What initially seems like the first part of a two-parter tracking the gang as they head out to witness the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl win turns out to be a Home Alone homage featuring Charlie left alone in the bar \u2014 which quickly devolves into a Saw-like survival story. Who knew they made activated latches on bear traps? Not Charlie, that\u2019s for sure.\n\n24. \u201cOld Lady House: A Situation Comedy\u201d (Season 12, Episode 3)\n\nAkin to \u201cThe Gang Tries Desperately to Win an Award,\u201d this episode takes aim at satirizing various televised comedy tropes, including the notion that you need a laugh track to keep your audience engaged. It\u2019s an antiquated idea to harp on, but no matter \u2014 Always Sunny is typically funniest when its characters are out-of-step with current trends anyway, and sure enough the conceit of turning Mac and Charlie\u2019s moms\u2019 shared house into a multi-cam sitcom yields hilarious dividends. Dee\u2019s failed attempt to become a recurring character in said nonexistent sitcom (meta enough for you?) is perhaps the funniest plot point in this episode, making for another instance in which Dee\u2019s inability to be funny is actually hilarious.\n\n23. \u201cThe Storm of the Century\u201d (Season 7, Episode 6)\n\nNotable moment in this perfectly chaotic and hilarious episode: Frank attempting a teaching moment with Dee in explaining to her how the media frames coverage of whites and non-whites during catastrophes \u2014 before dumping the lesson and showing her footage of him looting during the Rodney King riots. \u201cThe Storm of the Century\u201d seizes on a few of the gang\u2019s more unseemly and/or bizarre character traits (Dennis\u2019s predatory behavior, Frank\u2019s capacity for violence, Charlie\u2019s lack of intelligence, Mac\u2019s gluttony) and throws them right in the middle of a potential hurricane, making for the funniest big-box-store experience since the banter in The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\n\n22. \u201cThe Gang Gives Frank an Intervention\u201d (Season 5, Episode 4)\n\nIntervention! Intervention! How could you not love an episode that introduces Gail the Snail, a.k.a. \u201cthe garbage pail cousin\u201d (played with delicious disgustingness by Mary-Lynn Rajskub)? This one birthed a meme, not to mention the ingenious idea of drinking red wine in a Diet Coke can to mask the fact that you\u2019re drinking in public. (A personal anecdote: I got caught doing this by my Patterns of Adult Living teacher in senior year of high school. He didn\u2019t report me to the principal. Thanks, man \u2014 I owe you one.)\n\n21. \u201cMac and Dennis Break Up\u201d (Season 5, Episode 9)\n\nHow annoying is Mac? How codependent are Charlie and Frank? How pathetic is Dee? All these questions are asked \u2014 and most are answered \u2014 in this episode that tests the limits of the titular duo\u2019s friend-and-roommate-ship (beyond the fact that Mac wants to watch Predator too often). The sequence in which Charlie and Frank continue to insert multiple cats into Dee\u2019s wall \u2014 all in the service, of course, of getting the first cat that made its way into the wall out of there \u2014 is comic gold.\n\n20. \u201cSweet Dee Gets Audited\u201d (Season 7, Episode 4)\n\n\u201cThis is dark.\u201d \u201cDarkest thing we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d Indeed, the fake dead-baby funeral that this deliriously grim episode culminates in is dark as shit \u2014 and that\u2019s before Dee starts bleeding from the eyes. Proof that the show can still be side-achingly funny even in its bleakest hours, to the point where its comparatively lighthearted B-plot (\u201cPickles will prevail!\u201d) is nearly overshadowed by Dee\u2019s unending quest to scam the United States government. (The \u201cScammr\u201d license plate didn\u2019t help.)\n\n19. \u201cFrank\u2019s Back in Business\u201d (Season 8, Episode 7)\n\nThe moment in which Dennis \u201cgets off\u201d near the end of this episode is sick and wonderful, a totally strange outcome of his, Mac, and Dee\u2019s attempt to impersonate a visiting businessman and his associates who are the main shareholders of Frank\u2019s (or, should we say, The Warthog\u2019s) company he\u2019s been tapped to rescue. Also notable: A few shocking and hilarious moments here that reveal Dennis\u2019s dark depths.\n\n18. \u201cThe Gang Tries Desperately to Win an Award\u201d (Season 9, Episode 3)\n\nBasically an episode-long riff on the indignity of Always Sunny never winning any Emmys (for what it\u2019s worth, it won a People\u2019s Choice award in 2016, but we all know those don\u2019t count). \u201cThe Gang Tries Desperately to Win an Award\u201d is way less annoying than that description sounds, as the gang visits a shinier, happier, more award-winning bar and tries to ape their crowd-pleasing style, concluding in an ultra-dark musical performance from Charlie and an unspeakably grotesque burlesque act courtesy of Frank and Artemis (you\u2019ll never be able to un-hear the former yelling, \u201cPull the bottle out! Pull it out!\u201d after watching this one).\n\n17. \u201cThe Gang Buys a Boat\u201d (Season 6, Episode 3)\n\nI once saw someone on Twitter state that FX should create a spin-off channel airing this episode and this episode only \u2014 and I agree! \u201cThe Gang Buys a Boat\u201d is the kind of throwaway concept that Always Sunny thrives on, as the gang tries (and fails, in a literal blaze of glory) to fix up a nasty-looking schooner they purchase from their \u201cDick Towel\u201d profits (a callback from \u201cPaddy\u2019s Pub: Home of the Original Kitten Mittens\u201d). Dee demonstrates some terrible dance moves, Charlie dives for treasure, and Dennis\u2019s predatory side is fully exposed as he tries to lure women onto the boat (a tactic that fails even worse in the later, and far inferior, season 11 episode \u201cThe Gang Goes to Hell\u201d).\n\n16. \u201cMac and Dennis Buy a Timeshare\u201d (Season 9, Episode 4)\n\nThe gang has attempted myriad scams over the course of Always Sunny, but \u201cMac and Dennis Buy a Timeshare\u201d finds them on the other side of the grifting world. Despite Mac and Dennis\u2019s claim that they don\u2019t \u201cget got,\u201d they most certainly do in this episode, and the title pretty much spells out how; meanwhile, Dee gets ensnared in an Herbalife-style pyramid scheme, which results in another entry in the gang\u2019s many DIY attempts at crafting camcorder-filmed infomercials. Frank, meanwhile, is stuck in a coil. What does that mean, exactly? Nothing good, that\u2019s for sure.\n\n15. \u201cMac\u2019s Big Break\u201d (Season 6, Episode 4)\n\nIs this episode\u2019s B-plot funnier than its main plotline? It just might be: There\u2019s a lot of humor to be found in Mac and Charlie\u2019s quest to help the former become a \u201cPhilly sports legend\u201d by way of winning a slapshot contest at a Flyers game, and the episode\u2019s closing moments deliver on this ridiculous premise perfectly. But after watching this episode many, many times since its initial airing, I\u2019ve come to appreciate Dennis and Dee\u2019s aborted attempt to start their own podcast, pulling in a variety of secondary characters from the show\u2019s previous seasons (Ben the soldier! Rickety Cricket! The waitress!), as well as more morning-radio sound effects than anyone should be allowed to have access to.\n\n14. \u201cThe Gang Wrestles for the Troops\u201d (Season 5, Episode 7)\n\nPour one out for late wrestler Rowdy Roddy Piper, whose memorable Maniac character is introduced in this episode during which the gang attempts to put on a good-ol-fashioned wrestling show in support of the troops. Includes a memorable Artemis subplot (\u201cFine, then I\u2019ll be Desert Grape\u201d), as well as the introduction of Ben the soldier, whose first appearance gives us the indelible image of Frank solemnly saluting him while Seal\u2019s \u201cKiss From a Rose\u201d blasts from a boombox. Who doesn\u2019t love a good pair of jean shorts, too?\n\n13. \u201cCharlie Rules the World\u201d (Season 8, Episode 8)\n\nA heady episode of Always Sunny that also makes a mockery out of headiness \u2014 a bizarre discourse on the nature of reality that makes zero sense when held up to any level of scrutiny and is all the more funny for it. Dee\u2019s admission about the mobile game that the gang finds themselves addicted to (\u201cIt\u2019s like when I\u2019m doing good in the game, I\u2019m doing good in life\u201d) is all too relatable to anyone who\u2019s spent even an hour in a free-to-play wormhole. Meanwhile, Dennis\u2019s obsession with finding out what reality really is yields a brilliantly strange outcome. And then there\u2019s Frank\u2019s strange obsession with becoming a Real Housewife, an easily overlooked but nonetheless hilarious wrinkle in this chaotic episode.\n\n12. \u201cSweet Dee Has a Heart Attack\u201d (Season 4, Episode 10)\n\nA classic episode that centers around a time-tested Always Sunny approach: Have each member of the gang seek self-betterment, only to miserably fail in their efforts. Even if you\u2019ve never seen a single episode of Always Sunny, you\u2019ve seen this episode in theory: Charlie\u2019s \u201cboxes of Pepe\u201d meltdown yielded the most enduring meme Always Sunny was ever responsible for creating, the perfect image to express your wildest of conspiracy theories.\n\n11. \u201cFrank Reynolds\u2019 Little Beauties\u201d (Season 7, Episode 3)\n\nNot that it wasn\u2019t obvious before, but this is an episode that makes it painfully clear that there\u2019s something seriously wrong with Frank \u2014 he literally enters its opening seconds with a busted nose! Things get darker from there, as he attempts to fulfill his obligations to put on a child beauty pageant (don\u2019t ask) while desperately reassuring everyone that he\u2019s not a pedophile (no, seriously, don\u2019t ask). Lots of gems in this episode, especially the gang\u2019s attempts to insert themselves into the pageant through various musical numbers. \u201cMoms Stink\u201d or the \u201cYankee Doodle Dandy\u201d remix? You decide!\n\n10. \u201cThe Nightman Cometh\u201d (Season 4, Episode 13)\n\nAn episode so cherished by fans that the cast performed it live during a mini-tour in 2009, \u201cThe Nightman Cometh\u201d is one of the show\u2019s towering artistic achievements, as Charlie turns his song about \u201cthe Nightman\u201d from \u201cSweet Dee\u2019s Dating a Retarded Person\u201d into a full-blown musical \u2014 all for the purpose of impressing the waitress, naturally. It\u2019s an early taste of how much the gang loves pageantry and performance \u2014 22 minutes of unbridled joy as they messily band together to bring Charlie\u2019s musical dreams to life. Charlie\u2019s final song in particular is oddly touching, even as it represents his worst tendencies. An endlessly rewatchable slice of heaven that\u2019s earned all the fan adulation it\u2019s accrued since.\n\n9. \u201cThe Gang Goes to the Jersey Shore\u201d (Season 7, Episode 2)\n\nAn absolute classic of an episode that begins with Frank burning Dennis and Dee\u2019s old family photos in a trash can and ends with the gang getting the hell out of the Jersey Shore as quickly as possible, for fear of angel dust\u2013smoking murderers on their trail. \u201cThe Gang Goes to the Jersey Shore\u201d introduces a slice of essential Always Sunny iconography: \u201crum ham,\u201d Frank\u2019s alcohol-soaked porcine creation that\u2019s eventually lost to sea \u2026 or so we think. Even without the rum ham, though, there\u2019s a plethora of hilarious horrors in this episode, from Charlie drinking suntan lotion straight from the bottle to one of Dee\u2019s braids getting ripped out of her damn scalp by a wayward amusement park ride mechanism. Plus, there\u2019s a scene where Dennis throws up \u2014 and puke is always funny.\n\n8. \u201cThe Gang Group Dates\u201d (Season 10, Episode 2)\n\nSome of the best Always Sunny episodes in recent seasons dive deep into Dennis\u2019s pathological, nightmarish tendencies \u2014 his vaingloriousness and how it collides with his predatory tendencies. \u201cThe Gang Group Dates\u201d is practically an operatic performance for Howerton, as a series of interactions using dating (and, most impactfully, rating) apps sends him down a destructive, obsessive rabbithole. The B-plots equally deliver here, as Frank, Mac, and Charlie unsuccessfully attempt to group-date women at Paddy\u2019s and Dee tries to get revenge on one-night-stand-prone men but ends up eliciting the exact opposite reaction from what she wants.\n\n7. \u201cThe D.E.N.N.I.S. System\u201d (Season 5, Episode 10)\n\nOne person has a plan, several others glom onto it unsuccessfully, and another person attempts to replicate it with no success whatsoever: This is the basic formula for so many Always Sunny episodes, and rarely is it employed so potently than in \u201cThe D.E.N.N.I.S. System,\u201d which zeroes in on Dennis\u2019s questionably effective method for manipulating people sexually and emotionally. Dennis\u2019s system is cemented in this episode as canon, something he refers to in seasons to follow despite it almost literally never working in his favor \u2014 which speaks to his maniacal level of self-confidence.\n\n6. \u201cCharDee MacDennis: The Game of Games\u201d (Season 7, Episode 7)\n\nThe Ringer recently named this episode, for all intents and purposes, Always Sunny\u2019s finest half-hour. It\u2019s not a crazy claim, and the fact that it isn\u2019t holding the top spot on this list only speaks to how many strong episodes the show contains in its estimable history. This is the kind of chaotic, utterly unpredictable episode you need to see for yourself, but we\u2019ll agree with The Ringer that \u201cCharDee MacDennis: the Game of Games\u201d does contain one of the funniest scenes in the show\u2019s entire existence: When Frank, who\u2019s in a dog cage (you\u2019ll get it when you see it), asks to have his cage put on the bar so he can see what the gang\u2019s up to, to which Dennis replies \u201cShut up, dog!\u201d and throws a beer in his face. It triggers a deep laugh every time.\n\n5. \u201cThe Gang Misses the Boat\u201d (Season 10, Episode 6)\n\n\u201cWhat have we become?\u201d Dennis asks in the beginning of this classic episode. \u201cThe Gang Misses the Boat\u201d isn\u2019t the only episode in which the gang briefly splinters for the sake of self-betterment \u2014 but it\u2019s undoubtedly the best, as Dennis attempts to address his anger issues while Mac starts dating an angel-dust addict and Charlie and Dee (gasp!) fall in love. There are so many great one-liners and gags in this episode that it\u2019s hard to keep track \u2014 my personal favorite moment is Dee and Charlie\u2019s forays into \u201cdef poetry,\u201d as well as Charlie revealing that he\u2019s not allowed to order chicken at a restaurant \u201cwithout the beak\u201d. But, to keep it short and sweet, how can you not love an episode that triumphantly features the return of rum ham? Rum ham, indeed.\n\n4. \u201cMac & Dennis Move to the Suburbs\u201d (Season 11, Episode 5)\n\nIt\u2019s the second-strongest bottle episode that Always Sunny has accomplished to date, as Mac and Dennis decamp to the suburbs on a bet from Frank that involves a shitload of money, a California king bed, and the threat of having to share a bed with an old man for an entire year. Watching Mac and Dennis push each other to the limits of sanity \u2014 an impressive feat, considering how little sanity they had left to begin with \u2014 is a hilarious sight to behold, and that\u2019s before you find out what Mac does with their dog. A comedic stroke of psychosis that any city-dweller dreaming of more space \u2014 while also knowing at what cost that space can result in \u2014 will surely relate to.\n\n3. \u201cThe Gang Gets Analyzed\u201d (Season 8, Episode 5)\n\nAlways Sunny frequently finds comedic gold in deconstructing the numerous off-putting character traits that the gang\u2019s made up of \u2014 which explains why this therapy-centric episode is easily one of the series\u2019 best ever. The issue at the heart of \u201cThe Gang Gets Analyzed\u201d is simple: Who\u2019s going to do the dishes resulting from a recent dinner party? Of course, nothing is ever as simple as that, so the gang treats Dee\u2019s therapist\u2019s office as a literal revolving door (Dennis did tape over the lock, after all) as each member takes their turn on the proverbial couch and uncorks their mental brew. Mac\u2019s predictably all over the place, Charlie\u2019s hiding a pigeon, Dee\u2019s doing a terrible Good Will Hunting impression, Dennis is reliably pathological, and Frank \u2014 well, Frank\u2019s been unzipped, doc. Featuring one of the funniest credit sequences in the show\u2019s history, as well as a few reveals (Frog Kid!) that take strong hold in the show\u2019s canon in seasons to come.\n\n2. \u201cThe Gang Recycles Their Trash\u201d (Season 8, Episode 2)\n\nThere are multiple episodes throughout Always Sunny that riff on the show\u2019s own meta-ness \u2014 its tendency to recycle plotlines and characters ad nauseam, offering only the slightest and most subtle tweaks to previous occurrences within the show. \u201cThe Gang Recycles Their Trash\u201d is undoubtedly the most brilliant episode that does this, heading down multiple wormholes so meta that Dee notes at several points that even isolated lines of dialogue feel \u2026 familiar. Speaking of Dee: Episode writers Day, Howerton, and McElhenney bring back Dee\u2019s blackface caricature Martina Martinez for this one, and despite the obvious meta-offensiveness of it all (the point, naturally, is that Dee\u2019s a terrible person for thinking blackface is okay to begin with), it also serves as self-reflexive commentary on the show\u2019s occasional capacity to go too far in leaning into its characters\u2019 inherent awfulness. \u201cThe Gang Recycles Their Trash\u201d is far from a starter Always Sunny episode \u2014 it\u2019s plenty funny on its own, but deeply understanding the show\u2019s complex mythologies enhances its effectiveness. That doesn\u2019t make it any less of a dizzyingly hilarious achievement, though, as well as a testament to the show\u2019s ability to keep things fresh eight seasons in \u2014 even while digging through its own trash.\n\n1. \u201cThe Gang Dines Out\u201d (Season 8, Episode 9)\n\nWhat makes this bottle episode the finest Always Sunny episode to date? It\u2019s all about the simplicity of its plotting: Mac and Dennis, enjoying their monthly dinner, find themselves at Guigino\u2019s the same night as Charlie and Frank, who are celebrating their anniversary as roommates. Oh, and Dee\u2019s there too, eating alone on a Groupon deal and desperately trying to find a way not to look so pathetic. The conflict between the two pairs explodes like a box full of fireworks, while Dee spirals endlessly in her attempts to find anyone who will provide her temporary companionship; toasts are made, troops are praised, unspeakable acts involving Chrissy Orlando and a trampoline are spoken of, and Frank \u2014 naturally \u2014 threatens to pinch off someone\u2019s dick with a lobster claw.\n\n\u201cThe Gang Dines Out\u201d ends with a brilliant and literal crash, as well as the realization that these five dysfunctional, depraved, and utterly co-dependent miscreants not only deserve each other \u2014 they\u2019re meant to be, whether it\u2019s eating at the same table or laughing at the same cruel, harmful joke. It\u2019s the most heartwarming episode in a show that has spent 12 seasons kicking and screaming at the mere notion of \u201cheartwarming,\u201d as well as a testament to the true nature of friendship. We\u2019re lucky not to have the gang wreaking havoc in the real world, but we\u2019d be lucky to have friends like them, too.", "description": "It\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia has produced some memorable episodes over the years.
