While she was looking at the furniture, the home\u2019s owner \u2013 identified as Juliet Marsh by South West News Service (SWNS) \u2013 offered to take the young girl downstairs for a drink.\n\nBOY WITH TERMINAL CANCER WHO 'LOVES CHRISTMAS' CELEBRATES HOLIDAY EARLY THIS YEAR: 'IT'S THE RIGHT THING'\n\nA few minutes later, however, Beresford claims she heard a scream. She rushed downstairs to see her daughter had allegedly been bitten in the face by the woman\u2019s dog. She added that she wasn't even told there was a dog in the home.\n\nBeresford claims Marsh was reluctant at first to call for an ambulance, but eventually did. Her daughter was transported to a local hospital where she received 36 stitches on the right side of her face.\n\nBeresford said the doctor who treated her daughter suggested she pursue legal action against the woman.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to prosecute or anything like that. But then the surgeon who treated Molly said, \u2018This is a dangerous dog. You need to prosecute,\u2019\u201d Beresford recalled to SWNS.\n\nFollowing a hearing at Cheltenham Magistrates Court, the dog that allegedly bit Molly is now reportedly required to wear a muzzle while in public and cannot be left alone with children under the age of 17, according to SWNS. Marsh also reportedly received a fine of nearly $1,000. The dog's breed is not clear.\n\nRARE GONORRHEA-LINKED INFECTION THAT CAN LEAD TO MENINGITIS REPORTED IN MICHIGAN\n\n\u201cMolly had had her face ripped off by the dog. We were kind enough to let her keep the dog. I just want to make other people aware,\" she said, adding her daughter isn\u2019t afraid of her family\u2019s two dogs but clings to her mother \u201clike a leech\u201d when she sees other dogs in public.\n\n\"It was absolutely horrendous. It was awful. My daughter gets called \u2018Scarface.' She says, 'Mommy am I still beautiful?' Other than that she is coping really well. We are lucky because that dog could have taken her life that night,\u201d she added. \u201cEven though she is scarred we are lucky.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that nearly 1 in 5 people who are bitten by a dog require medical attention.
