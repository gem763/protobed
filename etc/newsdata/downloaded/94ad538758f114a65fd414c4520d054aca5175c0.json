The Texas Democrat said last night that he\u2019s willing to take away people\u2019s guns, specifically the guns liberals find scary. Leah wrote about it earlier this morning.\n\nDavid Muir: \"Are you proposing taking away [American's] guns...?\"\n\n\n\nBeto: \"Hell yes.\" pic.twitter.com/wg6VkrI0er \u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) September 13, 2019\n\nABC\u2019s David Muir asked O\u2019Rourke if he stood by his proposal for a mandatory buyback program, noting that many were equating it to gun confiscation. \u201cI am,\u201d he replied, \u201cif it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield... If the high impact, high velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body, because it was designed to do that, so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers.\u201d\n\nYou know grenade launchers are under NFA, right? ??????? https://t.co/TjJTPWcD0E \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) September 13, 2019\n\n\u2026 and suppressors.\n\n\n\nHere, use this instead Beto Campaign: pic.twitter.com/Sr3psrA5DS \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) September 13, 2019\n\nLoesch took to Twitter to shred Beto, who appears to think that AR-15s with grenade launchers are readily available for civilian ownership. They\u2019re not. They\u2019re heavily regulated by the National Firearms Act. This is a throwback to when USA Today thought you could put a chainsaw bayonet on a rifle. Some things never change and the anti-gun Left\u2019s ignorance remains appalling.", "description": ".09/13/2019 21:41:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/248/baacaca6-4152-48bb-81e1-75c7736d8b69.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
