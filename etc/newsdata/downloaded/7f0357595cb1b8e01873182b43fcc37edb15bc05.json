And possessing any sum does not constitute a crime, whether it was $1 million or $100 million,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"Trading in foreign currency is what constitutes a crime,\" he said, adding that charges related to illicit gain and accepting gifts did not apply to the president.\n\nBashir smiled as he sat in a metal cage in the courtroom. Supporters cheered for him as he entered and left the court, shouting \"Allahu akbar!\"\n\nSpeaking publicly for the first time since his ouster, Bashir said last month he had received $25 million from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as well as from other sources, but had not received or used money for his own benefit.\n\nHis prosecution is a test of how far power-sharing military and civilian authorities will tackle the legacy of his 30-year authoritarian rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Khalid Abdelaziz and Eltayeb Siddig; writing by Yousef Saba; editing by Deepa Babington)", "description": "Stacks of cash piled high were shown as evidence on Saturday against ousted Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir at his trial on charges of possessing illicit foreign currency and corruption.
