You'll get \u00a3100,000 pounds or around Rs 92 lakhs if you agree.\n\nReuters\n\nA British robot making company dubbed Geomiq is asking for people to use their face in a new 'state-of-the-art' humanoid robot that it is currently working on, along with an unnamed company.\n\nThe reason the company's name hasn't been revealed is because Geomiq is currently bound by an NDA or Non-Disclosure Agreement with the robot making company. People who get selected will be given more information on the project, albeit being bound by the same NDA.\n\nAs quoted in an official blog post, \"The company is searching for a 'kind and friendly' face to be the literal face of the robot once it goes into production. This will entail the selected person's face being reproduced on potentially thousands of versions of the robots worldwide.\"\n\nDon't Miss 820 SHARES 201 SHARES 279 SHARES\n\nAs per the blog post, the robot's purpose would be to \"act as a virtual friend\" for elderly people. The robot is expected to hit the production line next year and has been in development for almost five years.\n\nThe firm has taken investment from numerous independent VCs as well as a leading fund based out of Shanghai to manufacture these robots.\n\nGeomiq is currently known to make therapy robots like Paro that help senior citizens as well as army veterans to make them feel less lonely.\n\nReuters\n\nWhile the offer seems tempting, it'll be really awful if this face data gets accidentally leaks and taken by sex robot makers. With so many data thefts and breaches happening in even the best of companies, this occurrence doesn't seem as surprising.\n\nWould you still want your face to be on a series of mass-produced robots now?
