This time around, a 19-year-old girl has been arrested for allegedly throwing acid on her boyfriend who refused to marry her, in Aligarh's Jeevangarh area under Kawarsi police jurisdiction, a report in the Times of India stated.\n\nAn FIR has been registered against the girl under section 326 A (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid) of IPC on the basis of a complaint filed by victim\u2019s family member.\n\nRepresentational Image\n\nAccording to the victim\u2019s mother, the girl was in a relationship with her son but he stopped talking to her a month ago. She claimed that the girl started pressuring him to get married and was harassing him by calling him on phone every day. She said that she called her son even Thursday morning and when he did not respond to her call, she threw acid on him, when he was standing at a shop near his house.\n\nHowever, the girl alleged that the boy was threatening to make her intimate pictures with him viral on social media, if she did not marry him.\n\nRepresentational image/Picture Courtesy: Reuters\n\nJawahar Lal Nehru Medical College\u2019s Dr SS Zaidi said that the youth\u2019s eye was badly affected by the acid attack. He said that he still is under treatment.\n\nThis is not the first time such an incident has come to the fore. Earlier in June this year, police had arrested a 19-year-old woman who allegedly poured an acid-like substance on herself and her friend when they were on a bike on Vikaspuri area.\n\nRepresentational Image\n\nThe police said the accused poured acid on the boy's face to \"ensure he does not get out of their three-year relationship\". However, she acted as if someone else poured the acid on both of them since she was also the victim of the crime.\n\nPolice said that initially they thought that the couple was attacked by a person known to both of the victims as both of them had suffered burn injuries, but the 24-year-old boy didn't suspect that it might his own girlfriend.", "description": "A 19-year-old girl was arrested for allegedly throwing acid on her boyfriend who refused to marry her, in Aligarh\u2019s Jeevangarh area under Kawarsi police jurisdiction.
