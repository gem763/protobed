(I\u2019m looking at you, Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio), Susan Collins (Maine), Mitt Romney (Utah) and Ben Sasse (Nebraska).)\n\nYes, Donald Trump is, technically, \u201cpresident,\u201d and, yes, former Vice President Joe Biden used his government position to withhold foreign aid until the president of Ukraine fired a prosecutor looking into a company paying Biden\u2019s drug addict son millions of dollars for mysterious reasons.\n\nBut, the impeachment fanatics assert, by asking a foreign leader to assist in an otherwise legitimate corruption investigation, Trump has committed a monstrous crime \u2014 because he was pursuing a \u201cpersonal political interest.\u201d To wit: Trump was trying to harm his political opponent, Joe Biden.\n\nApart from the blindingly obvious fact that you can\u2019t commit crimes and then escape justice simply by running for president, Democrats take official government action for \u201cpersonal, political\u201d reasons all the time. Frequently, they do so for the sole purpose of harming their political opponents.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s IRS investigated and harassed conservative groups for years, using the most fearsome arm of the government to punish political enemies \u2014 for personal, political reasons. Then his Department of Justice refused to prosecute the corrupt officials, which, I believe, was again for \u2014 yes, it was personal, political reasons.\n\nHow about the Obama administration\u2019s endless investigations of Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson? As was obvious from the outset, Officer Wilson had done absolutely nothing wrong when he fatally shot Mike Brown \u2014 something even Obama\u2019s corrupt, subpoena-defying attorney general, Eric Holder, had to concede after reviewing all the evidence.\n\nThose massive Department of Justice investigations were undertaken to gin up the Democratic base in order to help Hillary, who proceeded to honor Mike Brown\u2019s mother on stage at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nIn the most perfect example of a president demanding investigations for no other purpose than serving a \u201cpersonal, political\u201d interest, in 1999, when Hillary was gearing up to run for the Senate from New York against Mayor Rudy Giuliani, President Bill Clinton (her husband) launched investigation after investigation into the crown jewel of the Giuliani administration, the NYPD.\n\nIf President Clinton had actually cared about police brutality, there were dozens of police forces that should have been probed before he\u2019d ever get to New York.\n\nSuch as, for example, the city Bill and Hillary lived in.\n\nIn 1999, as the NYPD was virtually eliminating crime in New York City, there were a grand total of 11 fatal shootings by police officers. That\u2019s 0.28 fatal shootings for every 1,000 officers.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., that year, there were four times as many fatal police shootings \u2014 1.14 per 1,000 cops. In Houston, the number was 1.68. In San Diego, it was 4.36.\n\nIn the end, Giuliani withdrew from the race to treat his prostate cancer, but when President Clinton was demanding these investigations, Rudy was crushing Hillary both in the polls and in political contributions.\n\nSpeaking of whom, Hillary used her position as secretary of state to overthrow Libyan strongman Muammar Qaddafi, leading to the murder of a U.S. ambassador and several other Americans in Benghazi, as well as creating the refugee crisis currently engulfing Western Europe \u2014 all for her own personal, political reasons.\n\nAs was dramatically revealed in Hillary\u2019s email exchanges with her unofficial adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, her motive for deposing Qaddafi was to display her foreign policy chops, apart from that lunkhead Obama, who was, as Blumenthal sneered, \u201cintent on seizing defeat from the jaws of victory.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal egged on Hillary to keep the pressure on Qaddafi, promising her a major political win. When Qaddafi was ousted, Blumenthal exulted: \u201cFirst, brava! You must go on camera. You must establish yourself in the historical record at this moment. \u2026 You are vindicated.\u201d\n\nSoon thereafter, Qaddafi was beaten to death in the desert by rebels who posted graphic video of the murder online. Cackling with delight at the initial reports, Hillary positioned herself alongside Julius Caesar: \u201cWe came. We saw. He died.\u201d\n\nMost obviously, the Obama administration\u2019s entire illegal FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign was undertaken for personal, political purposes. We\u2019ve been waiting for three years to hear some legitimate reason for the FBI\u2019s surveillance of the Trump campaign. At this point, I think it\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019re not getting one.\n\nThe Obama administration spent millions of dollars and millions of man-hours on a purely political investigation to hurt Trump and help elect Hillary.\n\nAs long as you mention it, the House Democrats\u2019 investigation of Trump\u2019s phone call to the Ukrainian president has been undertaken for personal political reasons, too. So was Biden\u2019s withholding of a $1 billion check from the president of Ukraine to protect his son\u2019s sleazy business deal.\n\nWe can play the \u201cpersonal, political motive\u201d game all day long!\n\nAt least when Republicans do it, the Middle East doesn\u2019t explode in jihadist fury, the crime rate doesn\u2019t skyrocket, people don\u2019t die or lose their livelihoods \u2014 and there\u2019s real corruption being exposed.", "description": "Democrats take official government action for \"personal, political\" reasons all the time.", "authors": ["Ann Coulter"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/05/coulter-headshot-640x480-640x480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
