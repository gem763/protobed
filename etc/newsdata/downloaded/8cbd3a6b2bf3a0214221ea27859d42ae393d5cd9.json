Perhaps the emotional toll of a lifetime of constant pain has left her prepared to feel little else. Or perhaps the pain signals that have flooded her brain for more than three decades have permanently rewired some circuits, leaving her unusually sensitive to even the slightest irritation.\n\nThere is evidence for all these theories, and more. But the truth is that no one really knows why pain persists in some people.\n\nMore than 5,000 years after the Sumerians discovered they could quell aches with gum from poppies, medical science is still uncertain about who will develop chronic pain, how to prevent it and what to do when it occurs. The reasons the same insult to the body can leave one person with short-term discomfort and another with permanent misery have eluded researchers.\n\n\u201cChronic pain is incredibly complex,\u201d said Benjamin Kligler, national director of the Integrative Health Coordinating Center at the Veterans Health Administration. \u201cIt is interwoven with all kinds of psychological, emotional and spiritual dimensions, as well as the physical. Honestly, the profession of medicine doesn\u2019t have a terribly good understanding, overall, of that kind of complexity.\u201d\n\nNow \u2014 prompted by the opioid epidemic \u2014 NIH, university researchers, Veterans Affairs and drug companies, among others, are reexamining chronic pain, hoping to develop new approaches to predicting and preventing an ancient malady that afflicts 50 million adults in the United States.\n\nFinding these answers could not be more urgent. The medical blunder of casually prescribing opioids for acute and chronic pain is partly to blame for the addiction crisis that has taken more than 400,000 lives over the past 20 years. Even with a sharp downturn in narcotic prescribing over the past seven years, Americans still consume 33 percent more opioids per capita than Germans, the second-greatest users, according to the U.N. International Narcotics Control Board.\n\nNew discoveries could transform the treatment of long-term pain, allowing doctors, psychologists, physical therapists and others to intervene before pain becomes chronic, or provide alternatives to drugs when it does.\n\nBreakthroughs also could help head off a growing backlash among chronic pain patients and their doctors, who are terrified that medicine\u2019s turn from powerful painkillers is cutting people off from the only thing that eases their suffering.\n\n\u201cOur message is we need better medicine,\u201d said Walter Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. \u201cThe methods we have now are just not effective.\u201d\n\nA major effort to put the clues together will begin Tuesday, when pain experts from around the nation meet at NIH for two days. They will review a list of predictors of chronic pain culled from the trove of research and winnow them to about 40 considered the most likely to be involved. Then the Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures project will award $40 million to researchers who will study 3,600 patients over 2\u00bd years, a quick timeline as medical research goes.\n\nThe goal is to develop a matrix of biological, psychological and social factors that might predict who is likely to develop chronic pain, and provide it to clinicians.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that we\u2019re going to find some [markers],\u201d said Linda Porter, director of NIH\u2019s Office of Pain Policy, co-director of the effort. \u201cBut finding one that\u2019s a solid signature \u2014 that\u2019s our reach.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is to figure out treatment strategies that are preventive,\u201d she said.\n\nHard to measure\n\nChronic pain is considered a \u201cbiopsychosocial disorder.\u201d Genes, brain structures, the severity of injuries and nerve inflammation can all be involved. But so can psychological factors: People with depression are more susceptible to chronic pain. People who \u201ccatastrophize\u201d an injury or illness are more often in chronic pain than people who dismiss or accept one. Childhood trauma has been associated with chronic pain in adulthood, as has social isolation.\n\nChronic pain \u2014 low back pain, headaches, arthritis, neuropathy and many other forms of it \u2014 costs American society $635 billion annually, according to the National Academy of Medicine. Taken together, the many varieties of chronic pain make up the most common and disabling health problem in the world.\n\nFor hundreds of years, healers looked to the location and extent of injuries, disease and surgery for the clues that might explain chronic pain, generally defined as pain that lasts more than three months, or beyond the time of normal tissue healing. (Some experts think it should be six months.)\n\nBut that approach proved unreliable.\n\nFor one thing, pain is subjective and difficult to measure. A stimulus that is unbearably painful to one person may be tolerable to another and a mere annoyance to a third.\n\nThe causes of some kinds of pain \u2014 such as low back pain, which affects 13 percent of the U.S. population \u2014 vary widely.\n\nAnd the peripheral nervous system, which carries pain signals from the source, can be involved in chronic pain \u2014 along with, or instead of, the spinal cord and brain. In the brain, many regions are involved in registering and soothing pain signals.\n\nAttention, fatigue, distraction and mood also influence perception of pain. So do emotions such as fear and anger.\n\nFor some people, pain \u2014 evolution\u2019s warning to protect ourselves from harm \u2014 becomes the problem itself.\n\n\u201cWe think of pain as a symptom. But in those patients, the pain is the disease,\u201d said Clifford J. Woolf, director of the F.M. Kirby Neurobiology Center at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and a neurology professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nTechnology that has become widely available this century \u2014 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machines and other devices like them \u2014 has enabled scientists to see inside the brain, in real time, while people are in pain.\n\nWhat they discovered has convinced many that the key to chronic pain is found in the organ that receives the signals, and whose makeup is altered slightly every time an electrical impulse arrives on the neuronal highway.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we bring in some patients and look inside their brains?\u2019 \u201d said A. Vania Apkarian, a professor of physiology, anesthesiology and physical medicine and rehabilitation at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine. \u201cAnd as soon as we did that, we found all kinds of differences between healthy pain patients and chronic pain patients.\u201d\n\nThe brain is so malleable that every interaction \u2014 including reading these words \u2014 alters its makeup in some tiny way. Imagine then, if circuits in some people\u2019s brains remain transformed long after their bodies have healed and pain signals are gone.\n\n\u201cOur brains are like muscles,\u201d said Eleni Frangos, a postdoctoral fellow who is working with Samuels, the sickle cell patient, at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, part of NIH. \u201cIf you exercise them, they change. If you don\u2019t exercise them, they still change.\u201d\n\nSamuels believes she has been in pain since the day she was born. As an infant, she couldn\u2019t be comforted. No one understood why, until she was diagnosed when she was 2 with sickle cell disease, which distorts red blood cells and prevents them from carrying sufficient oxygen to organs and tissues.\n\nShe nearly died during a medical crisis at age 7 and suffered a minor stroke at 13. To prevent another, she had blood transfusions nearly every month for years.\n\nAfter adolescence, her pain became worse \u2014 and chronic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a constant ache, deep down in the bones and in the muscles,\u201d said Samuels, 37, a legal instrument examiner for the D.C. Department of Corrections. \u201cThe ache is so deep that it almost feels like it\u2019s unreachable.\u201d By age 10, Samuels said she was taking heavy doses of morphine and Dilaudid before she got out of bed to go to school.\n\nLike many sickle cell patients, her chronic aches were punctuated every few months by attacks of excruciating pain that sent her racing to an emergency room.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish how I feel on my worst enemy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what I would say for people who have to live with pain every single day is, it\u2019s a humbling experience. It\u2019s humbling because you realize how life . . . is so precious.\u201d\n\nEighteen months ago, Samuels became one of a handful of people whose sickle cell disease was wiped out by a new gene therapy pioneered at NIH \u2014 a medical miracle of its own. But as the months went by, Samuels remained in pain while others did not. Researchers realized that the group would make excellent subjects for testing theories on the causes of chronic pain.\n\nIn an NIH clinic and in M. Catherine Bushnell\u2019s laboratory, where Frangos works, Samuels has gone through test after test to narrow down the possibilities. Pointed instruments were touched to her skin \u2014 first one, then two, to determine how well she could distinguish among them. Her hand was thrust in ice water. Pressure was applied to her thumbnail.\n\nIn June, Samuels lay in an fMRI scanner as a technician touched a small heated plate, called a thermode, at 119 degrees to precise spots on her leg at 10-second intervals. A second round of tests was performed at 115 degrees.\n\nAs Samuels rated the level of pain by pushing buttons on a handheld device, the machine recorded images of her brain. Later, using software developed for the purpose, Frangos would be able to examine which parts of her brain lit up in response to pain. The team is comparing them with images of the brains of former sickle cell patients who aren\u2019t in pain and of healthy volunteers to find differences.\n\nMore than two dozen structures in the brain are known to be involved in the perception of pain, and no two people react quite the same way. \u201cUnfortunately, humans don\u2019t come standard,\u201d Frangos said.\n\nBushnell\u2019s working theory is that the constant pain of sickle cell disease has permanently altered the circuitry somewhere in Samuels\u2019s brain, inclining her toward chronic pain, even though she is in remission.\n\n\u201cMy brain has just been feeling these pain signals for so long that it\u2019s just accustomed to pain being there,\u201d Samuels said.\n\nFinding the source of Samuels\u2019s pain is one challenge. Doing something about it is another.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of data on that, because there\u2019s not a lot of people who\u2019ve had pain for a long, long time and then suddenly get cured,\u201d Bushnell said.\n\nBut what if nothing significant has changed in Samuels\u2019s brain circuitry, and nature unfortunately set up her brain \u2014 and those of other people \u2014 to feel chronic pain?\n\nThat is Apkarian\u2019s theory. He has put away the pointy instruments, ice water and thermodes, because he doesn\u2019t think he needs them. Apkarian has published research showing that he can accurately predict who is likely to experience chronic low back pain just by examining his or her brain images and connectivity. He also says he can tell who will respond well to interventions, including placebo.\n\n\u201cIf we simply look at these people before they\u2019re even exposed to placebo . . . in all of them their brain properties tell us beforehand who will respond to the sugar pill and how much they will respond to the sugar pill,\u201d he said.\n\nWoolf, in contrast, thinks that about half the explanation for someone\u2019s likelihood to develop chronic pain is genetic. Not the work of one gene, unfortunately, but the complex interaction of many, he said. The rest can be explained by the many other factors that researchers are now considering \u2014 biological, psychological and social.\n\nHe envisions a day, not many years from now, when clinicians will encounter people in acute pain, or going into surgery, and first examine their genomes for clues to how likely they are to develop chronic pain. Then health-care providers will ask questions to assess their psyches and their social situations with the same goal.\n\nBy then, there may be drugs to prevent the onset of chronic pain. Or perhaps psychotherapy. Or a decision not to do surgery. All to avoid chronic pain before it starts.\n\n\u201cIf we could find a way of intervening, and preventing this consistent pain, then their need of opioids or heavy doses of analgesics will diminish,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInstead of symptom management, we would be managing the disease.\u201d\n\n'Is this really me?'\n\nIn the past month, Samuels\u2019s pain has diminished so substantially that she has stopped taking opioid painkillers. On some days, she feels no pain at all. When it does flare, she takes acetaminophen or ibuprofen. And that is enough.\n\nRecently she jogged up an escalator at a Metro station for the first time she can remember. She wasn\u2019t too tired. And she wasn\u2019t in too much pain.\n\nShe played catch with her nieces and a nephew. For years, she had to decline.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I was able to run after the ball, and bend down, and pick it up and throw it back and go real fast \u2014 I had to pinch myself and say, \u2018Is this really me?\u2019 \u201d\n\nHer doctors have told her that her red blood cells are becoming more robust, carrying oxygen around her body better than ever before. Bushnell and Frangos are still peering into her brain, searching for hints that might offer hope to others. Perhaps, they say, her brain circuitry is adjusting yet again.\n\nSamuels is allowing herself to think a bit more about the future. She has begun to consider returning to school to earn her college degree.\n\nAnd she is trying to adjust to living without pain or drugs. It\u2019s not as easy as she had imagined.\n\n\u201cImagine having pain every single day at such an intensity, and then almost overnight you\u2019re going through something where you\u2019re not in as much pain,\u201d she said. \u201cSo people look at it now like, \u2018She\u2019s fine.\u2019 You know, mentally, I\u2019m struggling, trying to figure out what\u2019s my new normal. I have to find out what that normal is for me.\n\n\u201cI want people to understand, but they don\u2019t understand,\u201d she added. \u201cSo again, you feel alone because there\u2019s only a select few that actually have been through what I\u2019ve been through.\u201d\n\nOpioid crackdown forces pain patients to taper off drugs they say they need\n\nMedicare will pay for acupuncture that is part of low back pain research\n\nTaking on chronic pain while preparing to swim the English Channel", "description": "\u201cWe think of pain as a symptom,\u201d says one expert. \u201cBut in those patients, the pain is the disease.\u201d", "authors": ["Lenny Bernstein", "Reporter Covering Health"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V74FFSW4TII6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
