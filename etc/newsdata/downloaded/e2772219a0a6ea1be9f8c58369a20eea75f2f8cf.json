The CPS and police must change their attitudes | Vera Baird Read more\n\nAn analysis shows the vast majority of police forces audited by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) have failed to collect accurate rape crime figures, resulting in cases going unrecorded and investigations not being carried out, raising the possibility that perpetrators could go on toreoffend. More than one in 10 audited rape reports were found to be incorrect.\n\nThe Guardian found complainants with mental health and addiction issues and victims of trafficking were particularly vulnerable to being struck from the record by a number of police forces.\n\nThe Guardian reviewed audits of 34 police forces published between August 2016 and July 2019. Only three of them were found to have accurately recorded complaints of rape, according to the audits carried out by HMICFRS. Of the more than 4,900 audited rape reports, 552 were found to be inaccurate.\n\nAs every report of rape is not audited it is not possible to know exactly how many are inaccurate, but more than 150,000 rapes were reported to police in that time which means potentially more than 10,000 cases could be affected by inaccuracies.\n\nThe inaccuracies in recording can range from incomplete paperwork to not recording a report of rape as a crime but noting it as an incident. This can lead to no investigation being carried out and the accused going on to reoffend. The data also found that a number of forces failed to improve in subsequent inspections, with some getting worse.\n\nVera Baird, the victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales, said it appeared police were failing to investigate reports.\n\n\u201cWhere cases are not being recorded as a crime and are dismissed as an incident, that\u2019s a concern because it may be that if the cases were investigated they could result in a prosecution. We know rape is a serial offence so it should be a very considered decision not to pursue something that looks like a rape as a crime of rape,\u201d said Baird.\n\nA spokesman for the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) said victims should have the confidence to report crimes knowing that they would be investigated and support would be provided.\n\n\u201cThe rate of rape reporting to police forces has sharply increased since 2014, and we are working to further improve the accuracy of crime reporting, which is governed by detailed counting rules set out by the Home Office. The accurate recording of crime can be influenced by many factors which may not be clear at the beginning of an investigation,\u201d the spokesman added.\n\nA spokesperson for HMICFRS said although recording of sexual offence crimes by police had improved since 2014 they could not definitively say if there had been an improvement in rape recording.\n\nInspections of police forces also found that vulnerable women, including those with mental health issues, addiction issues, or those reporting rape in a domestic abuse situation or who had been trafficked into prostitution were particularly at risk of having their cases ignored by police in a number of forces.\n\nIn one instance a rape was reported to Greater Manchester police but the case was not recorded as a crime. The victim was in a secure mental health facility and officers did not investigate further after staff from the facility assessed that the victim \u201clacked the capacity to make an informed complaint\u201d. The police later made direct contact with the victim, recorded the crime and it was under investigation in 2018. However, the force was unable to provide further details about the case based on the available information when contacted by the Guardian.\n\nIn North Yorkshire in 2017 a report of a victim with mental health issues was not recorded as a rape as \u201cofficers did not properly understand how to deal with her ability to consent\u201d, according to an audit of the police force. She subsequently reported being raped again by the same person. The force has since investigated the case although there was no prosecution.\n\nA spokesman for North Yorkshire police said: \u201cIt was not possible to bring about a prosecution due to several factors, including the victim declining to engage with the police, which made gathering enough information for a prosecution extremely challenging. Extensive safeguarding measures have been put in place by the police and other organisations to support the victim.\u201d\n\nLouise Ellison, a professor of law at the University of Leeds, has researched outcomes for vulnerable complainants reporting rape. She found that cases involving complainants with mental health issues were significantly less likely to be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).\n\nEllison said: \u201cPeople within the system who support victims of rape will tell you quite candidly that there are women who are coming in through their doors on quite a regular basis reporting rape and their cases are never appropriately investigated by the police.\n\n\u201cTheir cases go nowhere because they are automatically assumed to be lacking in credibility. People within the system know this but the frustrating thing is that there doesn\u2019t seem to be any real focus on it.\u201d\n\nThe latest figures from the police and CPS reveal that the criminal justice system is failing to keep up with the increase in the number of rapes reported.\n\nRecorded rape has more than doubled since 2013-14 to 58,657 cases in 2018-19. However, police are referring fewer cases for prosecution and the CPS is charging, prosecuting and winning fewer cases. The number of cases resulting in a conviction is lower than it was more than a decade ago.\n\nThe Guardian reported in September 2018 that senior staff at the CPS had urged prosecutors to take the \u201cweak cases out of the system\u201d, in order to improve its conviction rate for rape.\n\nA review of the treatment of rape cases within the criminal justice system was announced by the government in March 2019. The review covers the response from a moment a crime is reported to the police until conviction or acquittal in court.\n\n\u201cWe are conducting an end-to-end review into the criminal justice response to rape,\u201d a government spokesperson said, \u201cwhich will help us to better understand the decline in cases reaching the courts and improve our overall response.\n\n\u201cWe are taking action to restore public confidence in the justice system by recruiting 20,000 more police, creating extra prison places and reviewing sentencing to make sure violent and sexual offenders are properly punished.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Guardian scraped all the crime data integrity audits from the HMICFRS website to examine how police forces are recording rape. Once the data was collected it was structured and analysed to find how many forces were inaccurately recording rape reports.", "description": "Most forces audited failed to collect accurate figures, meaning investigations were not carried out", "authors": ["Caelainn Barr"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/830c03d51ac9c62395bb8e7e84efece963233a20/0_233_5130_3077/master/5130.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3f8491fbe8f55b403fae07ebb667ba97", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
