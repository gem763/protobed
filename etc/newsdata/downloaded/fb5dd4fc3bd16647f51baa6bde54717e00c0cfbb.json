In the paintings of east Londoner Frank Laws, however, there isn\u2019t a person in sight. The only signs of life are curtains flapping at open windows and the luminescent glow emanating from inside a home. Blocks of flats that teem with life in, say, Plan B\u2019s film and album Ill Manors, stand eerily quiet and vacant in Laws\u2019s images.\n\nLaws was born in a village in Norfolk but hated the rural quiet. \u201cI was always scared of the dark in the countryside,\u201d says the 37-year-old. \u201cI\u2019m still scared of it.\u201d It\u2019s this fear, and Laws\u2019 love of film noir, that informs the dramatic, Edward Hopperesque lighting in Laws\u2019 meticulously detailed watercolour and acrylic paintings.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Everyday beauty \u2026 Monument II by Frank Laws. Photograph: Peter Abrahams/Lucid Plane\n\nEach of the 4x5-ft works takes more than a month to complete at his studio in Dalston, and is based on photographs Laws takes during walks around the area \u2013 framing them from a pedestrian, spectator\u2019s view. Their silent stature is impressive \u2013 set centre stage, the buildings are imposing characters that direct the human activity that moves through them.\n\nAfter a year working as a labourer in Norwich, Laws relocated to Lower Clapton in east London in 2008. He was immediately struck by the beauty of the area\u2019s social housing estates \u2013 his time as a bricklayer gave him a particular appreciation of the work that had gone into the postwar buildings. \u201cThe tiled roofs, the brickwork details around the doors and balconies, I was obsessed with them \u2013 it was visual overload.\u201d\n\nSome of the buildings that became his muses over the next decade included Valette House \u2013 an impressive five-storey Edwardian block, one of the first to be built by the London County Council in Hackney, with sash windows and red and red-grey brickwork. The postwar buildings of Mayville Estate and Pembury Estate, as well as the historic Parkside Estate in south Hackney, have featured in his work. Laws used to title his paintings after the buildings that inspired them, but he is now leaving them untitled to encourage viewers to rediscover these local architectural landmarks.\n\nFor six years, Laws lived in council estates (these days he lives near London\u2019s tech hub, Old Street). His paintings chronicle buildings whose communities have changed dramatically \u2013 40% of what was social housing is now privately rented. The artist has felt the impact of what he describes as massive rent increases for homes and businesses and, recently, more disturbing \u201cin-your-face evidence of capitalism where not even a mid-tier business can survive. It feels like it\u2019s becoming completely whitewashed,\u201d he says. \u201cA non-place.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Where communities could thrive\u2019 \u2026 Monument I, by Frank Laws. Photograph: Lucid Plane\n\nIn his paintings, Laws maintains a spectator\u2019s view as an outsider looking in. Researching the buildings at Hackney Archives, though, has deepened his appreciation of their individual history and \u201cwhat they meant or supposedly meant politically \u2013 as better homes for families, affordable housing, where communities could thrive. A lot of positivity came out of those places, but that isn\u2019t always thought about or reported.\u201d Now, he says, the estates are \u201creminders of what has happened with housing since they were built\u201d.\n\nLaws depicts his tower blocks standing in the midst of fast-paced urban life and rapid gentrification. In recent years, some of the area\u2019s social housing developments have introduced controversial \u201cpoor doors\u201d \u2013 separate entrances to buildings for council and private tenants, and even separate playgrounds for children. \u201cI\u2019m not documenting the change itself,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m documenting these [tower blocks] as a testament to the change that is going on in and around them.\u201d\n\nSuch ruthless commercialisation, his says, is \u201cvery much the climate we live in. But it\u2019s easy to forget what has remained. This is my attempt to really romanticise and elevate these buildings and their original purpose.\u201d Laws\u2019s new exhibition, Monuments, will be presented within another overlooked gem of of east London\u2019s neglected architectural history; Holy Trinity Morgan Street, a 19th-century, Grade II-listed church that closed during the second world war, but recently reopened as an arts centre.\n\nThe east London estates he\u2019s painted this time aren\u2019t always considered historic. \u201cThey\u2019re just everyday homes that we pass all the time,\u201d says Law. \u201cI\u2019m trying to show them in a certain light, as future relics.\u201d Yet there\u2019s no didactic moral to these beautiful pictures. \u201cMy paintings ideally would be a vessel for discussion and awareness \u2013 not an answer or full stop.\u201d", "description": "Frank Laws\u2019s Hopperesque watercolours depict the individual character of east London\u2019s most impressive \u2013 and everyday \u2013 buildings, as gentrification threatens their very existence", "authors": ["Charlotte Jansen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd734a222c394523dc563c06fbfa1cffa5fb3612/0_48_3912_2346/master/3912.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb6b595d832e76a32cce53dd5e37dc09", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
