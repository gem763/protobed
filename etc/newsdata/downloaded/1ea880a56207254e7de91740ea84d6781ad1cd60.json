Do they want the charm of a quaint college town? The bustle of a big city? Something in-between? For students with their minds set on studying in a big city, the next factor to consider is cost. The elevated cost of living can make going to college in a city a challenge for many students, but when CNBC Make It compared hundreds of colleges and universities across the country to create our first list of the U.S. colleges that pay off the most, we found that many of the top-ranking schools located in major cities were able to keep costs low for students and graduate high-earning alumni. To develop our list of the top colleges that pay off, we identified the true net cost of each college for the typical American student \u2014 including tuition, fees, books, supplies and other expenses \u2014 after subtracting scholarships and grants. Using data from Tuition Tracker, we looked at the net cost for students from families making between $48,001 and $75,000. Then, using data from PayScale's College Salary Report, we divided net cost by graduates' expected annual earnings. (You can read our full methodology here.) To identify the schools providing the best value for students who want to study in a large city, we took a look at the 300 U.S. cities with the biggest total populations, according to the U.S. Census. Twenty-four schools on CNBC Make It's list are located in one of these major cities. Fifteen are in cities with more than 250,000 people. Several schools located just outside of city limits did not make the list. Harvard and MIT both enjoy close proximity to Boston, which has an estimated population of 694,583, but the schools are actually located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the population is 118,977. Similarly, California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, did not make the list despite being relatively close to Los Angeles, the second most populated city in the U.S., and University of California, Berkeley, did not make the cut despite being relatively close to San Francisco.
