He's just hanging. I'm not sure if he's alive or not.\n\n'There's a lot of emergency services here. It looks like they are planning what they are going to do.\n\n'They did send a helicopter up there. I think they are trying to work out how to get him down.'\n\nThe temperature in Carlisle is currently six degrees but would've been colder overnight and early this morning.\n\nPolice said a range of rescue methods have been tried so far today to free the man.\n\nEmergency services are currently awaiting the arrival of an industrial scale 90-metre cherry picker.\n\nIt is hoped that the cherry-picker may be able to finally free the trapped man.\n\nIt is unclear how the man came to be stuck there, with locals saying that he may have climbed up at around 10.30pm yesterday - though police confirmed he had been trapped since 2.20am\n\nFire chiefs have asked the public for a cherry-picker to help get the man down from the 270ft chimney\n\nA spokesperson for Cumbria Police, who is at the scene, said: 'Agencies became aware of a man trapped at height following calls to police at 2:22am today.\n\n'The agencies involved include Cumbria Fire and Rescue service, as the lead agency, supported by partners including the police, the coastguard, other blue light agencies, mountain rescue, Great North Air Ambulance and paramedics.\n\n'So far we have utilised technology including drones.\n\n'We have used a helicopter to make an attempt to try and rescue the man and we are working tirelessly across the emergency services to look at our options to try and bring this gentleman down safely.\n\n'This is obviously a very dangerous situation for the man involved and the rescuers as well. Therefore it may take some time.\n\n'Road closures are obviously in place and I would just like to thank the public for their patience. We are attempting to minimise disruption to the public and businesses.'\n\nJohn McVay, Cumbria Fire Area Manager said: 'I'd also like to ask anyone who has a cherry picker in excess of 90 metres within or near Cumbria to please contact Cumbria police or Cumbria Fire and rescue service on 999.'\n\nShocking footage shows the man dangling upside down near the top of Dixon's Chimney in Carlisle, Cumbria\n\nScott Mattinson, 24, and his fiance Nadene, 25, live nearby and Scott said: 'We heard a noise at about 10.30pm last night - some sort of wailing; like something in distress.\n\n'We thought nothing of it at the time.\n\n'But then at 1am Nadene woke up; we could hear shouting and a carry-on. We thought it was somebody who was drunk - you get used that, living near to Dalston Road. Then at 3am, there was more shouting, and it turns out that that was the police.\n\n'We looked out of the window and saw blue lights flashing.'\n\nRoads around the structure, built in 1836 and a prominent local landmark, have been closed.\n\nFootage appears to show a figure, upside down with his legs in the air, at the top of the chimney, with a helicopter used to unsuccessfully try to save him\n\nInitially, early morning mist made it difficult to see the man, before it cleared up and revealed him\n\nLocal reports said shouts and wailing could be heard coming from the chimney in the early hours of this morning before police arrived on the scene.\n\nIn a statement this morning, Cumbria Police said: 'Emergency services are continuing to respond to an incident at Dixons chimney in Carlisle where a man is trapped at height.\n\n'Cumbria Fire and Rescue and Cumbria Constabulary are at the scene.\n\n'The man was reported to have become stuck just after 2:20am this morning (28 Oct).'\n\nJohn McVay added: 'This is a very complex and difficult process given the obvious dangers to the man and the extreme difficulty in gaining access to him in a way which will keep him and emergency services safe.\n\n'I can assure the public that the emergency services are working tirelessly and effectively together to resolve this issues safely for all and that the protection of life is our first priority.\n\nDixon's Chimney was restored by Carlisle City Council in 1999. Originally it was 305 ft tall, but in 1950 it was shortened to 290 ft\n\n'I ask people impacted by the incident and the road closures to continue to show patience.'\n\n'I'd also like to ask anyone who has a cherry picker in excess of 90 metres within Cumbria to please contact Cumbria police or Cumbria Fire and rescue service on 999'\n\nThe road is currently closed at Stanhope Road, Charlotte Street and Shaddongate where it meets Bridge Street (A595)\n\nThe public are asked to avoid the area.", "description": "Police, fire and ambulance services have been scrambled to Dixon's Chimney in Carlisle, Cumbria to try and rescue the man 270ft up, with fire chiefs asking the public for a high-rise cherry picker.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/20275866-0-image-a-20_1572261082814.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
