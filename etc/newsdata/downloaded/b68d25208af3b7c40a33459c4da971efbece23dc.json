While many traders embraced this tumultuous price action, it seems that the cryptocurrency market is settling once again, with BTC finding support at $8,000.\n\nOver the past three days, the asset has been relatively still in the low-$8,000s, having not lost or gained more than 5% in any 24-hour period.\n\nWhile some believe that this lack of price action is a precursor to yet another bout of consolidation, analysts are starting to expect for Bitcoin to mount on a recovery. One that will bring the cryptocurrency up by at least 10%.\n\nChances for Bitcoin Recovery Building\n\nAccording to Josh Rager, as long as Bitcoin continues to \u201crange between heavy support near $8,000\u201d, the more likely it is that the cryptocurrency will see a nearly 10% bounce to $8,700.\n\nThe idea here is that as $8,000 has acted as an important historical level, it will here too. A close below it would be bearish; consistent closes above it implies that bulls have some semblance of control.\n\n$BTC continuing to range between heavy support near $8k and can expect a bounce to $8700+ if this continues to hold Any bounce I'll likely short but will continue to keep an eye on indicators and price action pic.twitter.com/9vYarErafw \u2014 Josh Rager \ud83d\udcc8 (@Josh_Rager) September 29, 2019\n\nRager isn\u2019t the only one expecting for Bitcoin to continue to the upside should the $8,000 support hold.\n\nLuke Martin, a well-known crypto analyst that was recently featured on CNN\u2019s \u201cCrypto Craze\u201d segment, explained that the recent close of the monthly CME futures contract may mean that gains for BTC are about the materialize:\n\n\u201cExpecting upside on $BTC towards 9k.
