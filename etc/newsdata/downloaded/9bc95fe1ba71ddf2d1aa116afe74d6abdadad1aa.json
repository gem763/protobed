When they get the chance to play, they have to be ready and have to play well.\u201d\n\nZidane used just three regular starters on Wednesday in the 2-0 win against Osasuna at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in the Spanish league. Only defender Sergio Ramos and midfielders Casemiro and Toni Kroos were not rested. Even goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stayed out of the starting lineup as Zidane looked to have his regular starters ready for Saturday\u2019s derby at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\n\n\u201cWe did a lot of good things in this game, I\u2019m thrilled about that,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cWe made some changes but those who played showed that they are ready.\u201d\n\nBrazilian teenagers Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Rodrygo scored against Osasuna, which left Madrid top of the league ahead of the city derby at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium.\n\n\u201cZidane knows he can trust all of his players for the entire season,\u201d said the 18-year-old Rodrygo, who made his debut with Madrid\u2019s main squad.\n\nMadrid is unbeaten in the league but opened its Champions League campaign with a 3-0 loss at Paris Saint-Germain. It hosts Club Brugge three days after the game against Atl\u00e9tico, when Zidane is going back to his main squad that features Karim Benzema, Eden Hazard and Gareth Bale.\n\nOPTIMISTIC GRIEZMANN\n\nAntoine Griezmann admits he is far from his best since joining Barcelona but is confident he will keep improving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different, it\u2019s a different type of football,\u201d the former Atl\u00e9tico Madrid forward said after his team\u2019s 2-1 win against Villarreal in the Spanish league on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m playing in a different position. I knew it was going to be difficult for me, but also that I would keep improving match after match.\u201d\n\nGriezmann has scored three goals in seven games since joining Barcelona this summer after five seasons with Atl\u00e9tico. His best performance came in the 5-2 win against Real Betis in the Spanish league last month, when he scored twice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too bad,\u201d Griezmann said. \u201cI can do better, but I\u2019ve just arrived. I\u2019m on the right track and will keep working to help my teammates. And if I can keep scoring, even better.\u201d\n\n__\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After an up-and-down start to the season, coach Zinedine Zidane is going back to the formula that helped Real Madrid succeed when he first took over three years ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tales Azzoni"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/spain_soccer_la_liga_97576_c0-145-3514-2193_s1770x1032.jpg?5e0be0eb54e0ca2130723d52bc498c19589ae301", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
