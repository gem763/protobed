For the hospital ward and the police station, we have researchers and medical advisors to check the set to make sure it is realistic and as up to date as possible.\"\n\n(Image: LIME PICTURES)\n\nThe Dog jetty isn't attached to the pub\n\nYou might or might not be surprised to learn that the internal sets are not matched up to their relevant external sets.\n\nThe Dog pub has seen many dramas unfolding, with scenes often following the characters outside of the venue.\n\n(Image: LIME PICTURES)\n\nBut the large jetty and outside area are not on the same location as the pub interior itself.\n\nThis is the same for most of the houses, venues and other locations, with the inside areas not directly next to or attached to the outside.\n\nNone of the houses are real, but the home that used to belong to the Ashworths and then the Roscoes, currently empty, does have a second floor and real stairs - not common in soap sets.\n\n(Image: LIME PICTURES)\n\nThe McQueens' house used to be an on-set swimming pool\n\nTom Cunningham actor Ellis Hollins confessed to us on the set that he was left slightly gutted when the McQueen family rocked up.\n\nBut that was only because their house used to be the on-set swimming pool used by the cast.\n\nThe only thing is it had an age restriction, and when Ellis was finally old enough it was removed to make way for the McQueens' home.\n\nCast tattoos - real or fake?\n\nSome tattoos viewers see on characters are in fact real, while some cast members have to cover up their inkings.\n\nLeela Lomax actress Kirsty Leigh Porter and Maxine Minniver actress Nikki Sanderson are allowed to show their real-life tattoos on screen.\n\nNancy Osborne used to have a fake tattoo which was removed \u2018by lasers\u2019 as part of a storyline.\n\nThe team told us: \"Some actors have tattoos in real life that have to be covered up for many reasons, like they are not suitable for the character or the tattoo being personal such as date of birth or a member\u2019s family name.\n\n\"It is harder to cover up tattoos than apply them as the concealer needs to match each individual artiste\u2019s colouring.\"\n\nThe supermarket is stocked with real food - partly\n\nMost soap shops do not stock real food and drink, because it would be pretty expensive to keep them stocked up with products running out of date.\n\nBut there is something in Price Slice that is real - the sweets! The wine is not real though, and fake alcohol is used in scenes in the pub.\n\nThe Hutch actually has a fully functioning kitchen in its restaurant though, and while the cakes in the nearby caf\u00e9 are fake the coffee machine and taps are real.\n\n(Image: LIME PICTURES)\n\nThe Dog's pond doesn't have any fish\n\nThe water outside the pub is obviously real, but while there are real ducks swimming around it doesn't actually have any fish.\n\nThere is other pond life including plants, while we can confirm the boat docked by the jetty is real - for anyone who was wondering.\n\n(Image: LIME PICTURES)\n\nSoap firsts\n\nAway from the sets and the make-up room, Hollyoaks has tackled a number of soap firsts on the show over the years.\n\nFrom male rape, with both Luke Morgan and John Paul McQueen at the centre of their own male rape storylines, to Ste Hay being the first gay character in a soap to be HIV positive.\n\nHollyoaks was also the first soap to have a gay wedding, when Ste wed John Paul in 2014.\n\nThis year saw the show tackle a radicalisation storyline in another controversial plot.\n\nHollyoaks airs weeknights at 6:30pm on Channel 4, with the next episode at 7pm on E4.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Hollyoaks village is harbouring as many secrets off-screen as it is on-screen, with some very interesting details about the sets and locations", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Lime Picture", "Lime Pictures", "Channel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650788.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Hollyoaks-Village-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
