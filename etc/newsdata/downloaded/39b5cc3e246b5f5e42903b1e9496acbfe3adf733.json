However, there may not be in-house cybersecurity specialists available and so bug bounty platforms can provide a way for companies to secure outside help.\n\nSee also: Apple expands bug bounty to macOS, raises bug rewards\n\nThe HackerOne client roster includes a number of well-known companies including Dropbox, Coinbase, GitHub, Google Play, PayPal, Qualcomm, and Verizon Media. In addition, the platform is used by the US Department of Defense (DoD), the European Commission, the Ministry of Defence Singapore, and Goldman Sachs.\n\nSan Francisco-based HackerOne has completed four funding rounds to date. The latest Series D has brought total investment up to $110.4 million.\n\nInvestors include Valor Equity Partners, New Enterprise Associates, Dragoneer Investment Group, Benchmark, and EQT Ventures. The announcement of the latest funding round coincides with David Obrand, a partner at Valor Equity Partners, joining the HackerOne board of directors.\n\nCNET: Clerk uses photographic memory to steal credit card info from 1,300 customers\n\n\"HackerOne is leading a new wave of cybersecurity companies tackling the unique challenges brought on by rapid growth and more sophisticated attack surfaces,\" Obrand said. \"Hacker-powered security is here to stay and with its tremendous customer and hacker community, HackerOne is dominating the market.\"\n\nOn the heels of the announcement, the bug bounty platform also revealed some interesting statistics. Over 30,000 vulnerabilities have been reported and resolved in the past 12 months and only 24 hours, in 77 percent of cases, is required for a new bug bounty program to receive its first valid report. In total, 25 percent of bugs discovered are considered high or critical and the average bug bounty paid is $3,384.\n\nWhile some vendors employ crowd-sourced vulnerabilities through such platforms, they may also run their own independent programs. Google's Project Zero, for example, finds and reports serious bugs impacting other companies and generally maintains a strict 90-day disclosure deadline.\n\nTechRepublic: How to sign into your Microsoft Account website without a password\n\nIn recent news, the Google security team published a series of blog posts detailing exploits used against iOS users when they visit malicious websites. A zero-day security flaw was resolved due to Google's report but Apple disputed the implied scale of the attacks. Google's team described the attacks as \"en masse\" whereas the iPad and iPhone maker says that the campaign was \"narrowly focused\" and involved fewer than a dozen domains.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
