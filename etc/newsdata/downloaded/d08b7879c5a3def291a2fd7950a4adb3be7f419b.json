I heard mothers crying when they saw the bodies recovered from the sea.\n\nIt was very distressing to take photographs of them at that moment partly because I had never experienced grieving that intense before.\n\nRecently, approaching the first anniversary of the tragedy, I happened to meet a community group through a photographer friend. The group is called \u20184/16 achievements\u2019, referring to the date of the accident and the achievements of the children up to the time of their death.\n\nThis community group had been trying to collect children\u2019s belongings given by their families as a way to remember those who lost their lives.\n\nI came up with the idea for this series of photos to mark the first anniversary when talking with members of this group.\n\nFamilies of the dead had gathered in a square in central Seoul to protest, calling for an official enquiry into the sinking. I explained my idea to the people I met there. Twelve families accepted my proposal.\n\nAll of the relatives I met as part of this project wanted me to take photos of them standing in front of their loved ones\u2019 belongings.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t forget our children,\u201d I kept on hearing parents say.\n\nBefore taking the photographs, I talked with family members for about 30 minutes and asked them to stand in their children\u2019s room.\n\nThey stood calmly in front of my camera but I felt it was like a protest combined with deep sorrow, calling for their children not to be forgotten.\n\nEven so it was very hard to take these photos. I saw the eyes of the family member through my lens and I felt their deep sorrow.\n\nIt was an immense sadness I had to face when I took the pictures.\n\nWhen I visited the first family, I saw a note that said, \u201cHa-yeong\u2019s dream is to become an international aid worker\u201d on a girl\u2019s desk.\n\nThat prompted me to ask about other children\u2019s ambitions during my visits to the families.\n\n\u201cAs I see photos of the children, each and every one of them is pretty and precious,\u201d said Kim Mi-hwa, mother of a boy called Bin Ha-yong.\n\n\u201cAll of them had dreams,\u201d she said. \u201cThey could have become a president, a minister, a famous artist. It\u2019s a tremendous loss for our country.\u201d\n\nHer son talked about becoming an illustrator. I remember seeing the drawings left behind in his room.\n\nOf the 325 students on board the sunken ferry Sewol, 250 never returned to their families. On that day a year ago, 250 dreams sank with them.", "description": "Jung Hwi-beom was among the 250 students and teachers from Danwon High School who died in the Sewol ferry disaster.
