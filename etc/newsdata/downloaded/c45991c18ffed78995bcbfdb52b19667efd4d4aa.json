Katie Hill To Resign From Congress After 'Inappropriate' Relationship Exposed", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Katie Hill will be resigning from Congress at the end of the week. Red State broke the story about a two-year relationship Hill and her husband shared with a campaign staffer, and another relationship Hill had with a member of her campaign staff. The California Democrat tweeted a copy of her official statement on Sunday night.\n\n\"It is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress. This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country. This is what needs to happen so that the good people who supported me will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation. Having private photos of personal moments weaponized against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy...\u201d\n\nHill's resignation comes after the House Ethics Committee launched an investigation of the California Democrat last week.\n\nOther media outlets posted racier photos of the freshman congresswoman. The House Ethics Committee is investigating another inappropriate relationship Hill may have had with a person on her congressional staff.\n\n\"For the mistakes made along the way and the people who have been hurt, I am so sorry, and I am learning \u2013 I am not a perfect person and never pretended to be. \" Hill writes in her letter.\n\nHill has apologized for her inappropriate relationship with her campaign staffer, but she has denied the inappropriate relationship with her congressional staffer.\n\n\u201cI love this country, I love all of you, and I thank you for allowing me the great honor of serving you.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
