By no means a lavish publication, it nevertheless became one of photography\u2019s cult books, inspiring generations of photographers to document the intriguing nuances of the everyday.\n\nFrank, who has died aged 94, trained as a photographer in Switzerland in the early 1940s, working on stills for film productions during the war years before turning freelance in 1945. He sailed for New York in 1947, finding work at fashion journals Harper\u2019s Bazaar and Junior Bazaar. But the world of fashion was not to his liking \u2013 he disliked the image\u2019s subservience to the story and the dominance of art directors and editors \u2013 and soon he was freelancing in a city that was at the centre of the new documentary photography movement.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

A Guggenheim fellowship in 1954 allowed him to begin an odyssey across the US, making the photographs that Kerouac would describe as \u201ca sad poem sucked right out of America\u201d.\n\nThe Americans consisted of 175 black-and-white photographs. None were dramatic, all were of ordinary scenes: a man and a woman glimpsed through a car window in Detroit; a waitress in a coffee shop in Indianapolis; a young woman in furs at a movie premiere in Hollywood. In search of subjects, Frank travelled all over the country, waiting to chance upon an ordinary moment redolent with mystery and meaning. The Americans is pervaded by a sense of melancholy and disconnection, a nostalgia for a disappearing society melded with a powerful appreciation of modernity \u2013 or, as the critic Mikael van Reis put it, \u201ca country of vacant skies, long roads and hungry hearts\u201d.\n\nThe Americans was published first in France in 1958, then in the US the following year. Frank had met Jack Kerouac and the Beat poets in New York, and he asked the On the Road author to pen the book\u2019s introductory essay. Like Frank, Kerouac was fascinated by America\u2019s vastness, by its diverse populations and its underlying sense of unease, and his essay was an apt companion for the photographs.\n\nIn time Frank was diverted from photography into filmmaking and quickly become absorbed in a medium that depended less on the whims of art directors and more on individual entrepreneurism. After his film debut Pull My Daisy (1959) \u2013 co-directed by Alfred Leslie, written and narrated by Kerouac and featuring Allen Ginsberg and others from the Beat movement \u2013 he joined with a group of US filmmakers to form the New American Cinema Group. His film output included Conversations in Vermont (1969), About Me: A Musical (1971) and, most famously, the Rolling Stones documentary Cocksucker Blues (1972). He also taught film in Rochester and later Halifax, Nova Scotia (he had moved to Canada in 1971).\n\nHis photographic style shifted during this time, influenced by cinematography and a kind of poetic improvisation. His work graced the cover of the Stones album Exile on Main St (1972), and that year saw the publication of his second photography book, The Lines of My Hand. These images were more radical, with texts scrawled on the surface of the print, photos arranged as assemblages, coded messages decipherable only by a cognoscenti. The death of his daughter in an air crash in 1974 appeared to prompt more of a dissonant rage in his work.\n\nHe continued to make films such as Life Dances On (1980) and Home Improvements (1985), but it is his photography that has endured and thrived in reputation. The subject of a 2015 documentary film Don\u2019t Blink \u2013 Robert Frank, he was a maverick in his field, with an incisiveness of vision and an understanding of the violence and melancholy of everyday life \u2013 no easy thing to quantify.\n\nHe is survived by his second wife, June Leaf, and a son. A daughter predeceased him.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
