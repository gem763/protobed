REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo\n\nThe two companies announced they would leave the association Friday afternoon, as did EBay Inc (EBAY.O), Stripe Inc. and Latin American payments company Mercado Pago. They join PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) which exited the group a week ago, as global regulators continue to air concerns about the project.\n\nThe latest exodus leaves the Libra Association without any remaining major payments companies as members, meaning it can no longer count on a global player to help consumers turn their currency into Libra and facilitate transactions.\n\nThe remaining association members, including Lyft and Vodafone, consist mainly of venture capital, telecommunications, blockchain and technology companies, as well as nonprofit groups.\n\n\u201cVisa has decided not to join the Libra Association at this time,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association\u2019s ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s head of the project, former PayPal executive David Marcus, cautioned on Twitter against \u201creading the fate of Libra into this update,\u201d although he acknowledged \u201cit\u2019s not great news in the short term.\u201d\n\nLibra will press ahead with plans to formally charter the association in three days despite the setbacks, Dante Disparte, its head of policy and communication, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association of some of the world\u2019s leading enterprises, social impact organizations and other stakeholders,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlthough the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra\u2019s governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient.\u201d\n\nFacebook announced plans to launch the digital currency in June 2020 in partnership with other Libra Association members. Almost immediately afterwards, the project faced relentless scrutiny from global regulators, who said it raised a host of serious questions that the group had yet to answer.\n\nFrance and Germany last month pledged to block Libra from operating in Europe and backed the development of a public cryptocurrency instead. And U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggested the project could not advance before addressing serious privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability concerns that must be addressed.\n\nThe rapid succession of exits by major financial companies Friday afternoon suggested that scrutiny was taking its toll.\n\nThree days earlier, a pair of senior Democratic senators wrote to Visa, Mastercard and Stripe, telling them to be wary of \u201ca project that will forseeably fuel the growth in global criminal activity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you take this on, you can expect a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all activities,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown and fellow Democratic Senator Brian Schatz wrote in the letters.\n\nBrown said in a statement after the announcements on Friday that the companies had been \u201cwise to avoid legitimising Facebook\u2019s private, global currency.\u201d\n\nFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to discuss the project when he testifies before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Oct. 23. U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the panel, has repeatedly called on Facebook to shelve the project.", "description": "Facebook Inc's ambitious efforts to establish a global digital currency called Libra suffered severe setbacks on Friday, as major payment companies including Mastercard and Visa Inc quit the group behind the project.", "authors": ["Pete Schroeder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439842187&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A20N", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
