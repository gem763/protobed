She talks about the struggle to be dispassionate and focused on solving each caseOne of the most striking aspects about fire-brand police officer Chhaya Sharma is her friendly disposition. She has a naughty gleam in her eye when answering questions, and doesn\u2019t shy away from letting the real \u2018Chhaya\u2019 shine from behind the uniform. Yet, it is not tough to imagine that she has cracked tough cases like PNL Nidhi Chennai scam, the Delhi Defence Colony bank van heist, the Baby Falak case, and the Sultanpuri gang rape case, and has caught notorious criminals like Narender Don and Raju Hakla. She garnered prominence with the Nirbhaya case, on which she and her team worked round-the-clock, since they had only a few vague leads to go with. The 47-year-old officer, who currently serves as the Deputy Inspector General, Investigation Division, National Human Rights Commission, says her family is her emotional anchor. She is extremely vocal on Twitter, and loves spending time with her husband Vivek Kishore, who is an IG rank officer in the IPS and Joint Director with the Ministry of Environment.I knew that I wanted to serve the country as a civil servant, and being a police officer didn\u2019t appeal to me initially. My mind took a turn when I topped the IPS list, and I wanted to give it a try. Post that, there was no looking back. I loved wearing the uniform, and enjoyed the training and related activities. Once I was in the field, I started understanding how police action can render quantitative assistance to victims in the fastest manner. If not a police officer or civil servant, I would have been a travel entrepreneur or a restaurateur.The motivation stemmed from the empathy I felt for Nirbhaya, and the hapless situation of her parents. Being a mother, sister, daughter, and a friend, I was internally troubled and wanted to do my bit as a police woman. Moreover, once a criminal feels he can commit a crime without getting caught, his confidence increases to repeat the offence with impunity. Seeing the macabre nature of this crime, these men had to be caught in the shortest possible time.As a team, we were great in complementing each other, and using the core strengths of each member. All officers worked with a singular aim\u2014nabbing the culprits as quickly as possible. Much information had to be collated, processed, and turned into actionable points.Yes! The months before the verdict had become nail-biting as the victim\u2019s parents were getting impatient and the Supreme Court was hearing the case details threadbare on a daily basis. The Court gave that verdict after scrutinising submissions from both sides; it was a culmination of our team\u2019s diligence for the previous four-and-a-half years, during which we had to pass many tests. We all felt that it was a huge success.My initial stint in Delhi as a trainee police officer in Central District as head of PS Kamla Market was quite eventful. While patrolling, I had a chance encounter with a victim of trafficking. I rescued her and another girl that day. The incident was an eye-opener, and I could sense that my team was reluctant to assist me for reasons best known to them. Nevertheless, my DCP supported me, and went on to rescue many trafficked victims. I discovered the underbelly of organised crime, which networked smoothly across various channels to make money by exploiting little girls and young women. As a rookie, these cases had a cataclysmic effect on me, personally and professionally.I felt nothing short of pride, being the first Indian police officer to get such an accolade for my service to the country. I attended the Sedona Forum organised by the McCain Institute of International Leadership of the Arizona State University, and interacted with many senators and officers. During my exchanges, I was able to create a positive image of police officers while I represented my country.Discipline and hard work can move mountains, and if used in tandem, are capable of beating lazy talent.It brought out the issues faced by police officers and their dedication in solving crimes. I had just one expectation from the series\u2014that the public\u2019s negative perception is modified. Shefali Shah has been my favourite since Hasratein and Satya. I am honoured that Richie Mehta (director) chose her to play the character inspired by me. She portrayed the nuances convincingly.", "description": "Super-cop Chhaya Sharma, the main brain behind the Nirbhaya case, believes that emotions are part of being human.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/sep/sthchhaya1569824853.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
