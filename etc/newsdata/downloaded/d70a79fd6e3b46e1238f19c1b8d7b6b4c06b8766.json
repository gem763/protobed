In July, Samsung said it had improved the design and construction of the phone, along with \u201cadditional reinforcements to better protect the device.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Samsung said the Fold will feature a 7.3-inch flex display along with a 5G-ready option in certain countries. But its price tag \u2014 about $2,000 \u2014 may scare off budget-minded consumers.\n\n\u201cDuring the past several months, Samsung has been refining the Galaxy Fold to ensure it delivers the best possible experience,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cNot only we improved the Galaxy Fold\u2019s design and construction, but also took the time to rethink the entire consumer journey.\u201d\n\nSamsung said the device will give consumers the best of both worlds \u2014 a tablet-sized screen that folds small enough to fit in your pocket.\n\n\u201cConsumers have responded positively to larger screens, and the Galaxy Fold\u2019s revolutionary form factor offers a bigger, more immersive screen without sacrificing portability. This is what we call innovation of new mobile experience in action,\u201d said DJ Koh, president and CEO of Samsung\u2019s IT and mobile communications division, in a statement.\n\nSamsung has high hopes for the Fold. In July, the company reported its second-quarter net profit plunged more than 50% as smartphone demand waned.\n\nLast month, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 10 smartphone to rival Apple Inc.\u2019s AAPL, +1.70% iPhone.\n\nSamsung shares 005930, +4.42% have risen 19% year to date in South Korean trade, compared to a 1.4% loss in 2019 by South Korea\u2019s benchmark Kospi 180721, +1.33% index.", "description": "The world\u2019s biggest smartphone maker announced early Thursday that the Galaxy Fold will go on sale in South Korea on Friday, and in select countries such as...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ719_galaxy_ZG_20190904230453.jpg"}
