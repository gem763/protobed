Calvin Mattheis, calvin.mattheis@knoxnews.com\n\nAs fans of the human variety crowded into Neyland Stadium to watch the University of Tennessee play Georgia, one special critter got a front row seat. Sinan the squirrel sat back in his own squirrel-sized chair to catch all the action.\n\nWe have a lot of questions, but none of them matter. It's a squirrel in a UT football helmet, and we\u2019re all for it.\n\nSinan is the team's biggest (and smallest) fan. His love for the Vols all started when his owner and rescuer, Saed Awad, took him fishing at a marina in Oak Ridge.\n\nSinan was only a few months old when Awad, who lives in Oak Ridge, saw Tennessee rowers practicing in the water. Since rowers scared away the fish, Sinan just sat on Awad's shoulder to watch. It didn't take long for the rowers to notice.\n\nSoon, Awad was getting messages from the rowers, asking him to bring Sinan to their events. At the next race, Awad showed up with Sinan in hand. This time, Sinan was sporting a tiny UT hat that Awad had found for him.\n\n\"Everyone went crazy,\" Awad said. \"That's when it became a UT thing.\"\n\nSinan continued repping the UT rowing team until football season arrived. Awad was hoping to get some photos of Sinan perched on one of the campus Smokey statues before the season started, so he traveled to campus on what he thought was going to be a quiet Sunday \u2014 only it wasn't.\n\nAwad accidentally traveled to Neyland during Fan Day practice. Sinan didn't have his signature UT helmet yet, so Awad made do with an orange peel and a Power T sticker.\n\nBefore the storm hit and the practice was cancelled, Awad and Sinan met many fans and a local television reporter who did the first story on Sinan. After that, Sinan's stardom skyrocketed.\n\nSinan's likeness was painted on The Rock, Awad started selling Sinan game day buttons and they both met another UT-loving animal, Smokey.\n\nOther local and out-of-state teams have reached out to Awad, asking if Sinan would wear some of their gear if they sent it to him.\n\nSinan with Smokey at a UT rowing event (Photo: Photo provided by Saed Awad)\n\n\"I tell them 'No, he already has a team,'\" Awad said.\n\nSinan has taken countless photos with followers around Knoxville.\n\n\"The thing I love most about Sinan is how he makes kids smile. ... Seeing people smile is like happiness,\" Awad said. \"When I made the (Instagram) page, I just made it because there's so much bad on the internet. People complain and argue about everything, so I just want to make a space without drama.\"\n\nAwad also is passionate about giving back. He donates a portion of the profits from Sinan's game day buttons to a local animal shelter and is working on several other Sinan-inspired projects, including a calendar and children's book that could help cancer research efforts.\n\nFor now, Awad and Sinan are inseparable friends, but Awad said that even if Sinan runs away one day, he'll be happy that he's living the life he wants to live.\n\n\"If he decided to go now, I'm not going to hold him,\" Awad said. \"It's his life. That's why I saved him.\"", "description": "Saed Awad of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, rescued Sinan the squirrel, and now they're best friends and huge Vols fans.
