To celebrate, the band's three members \u2013 Judah Akers, Brian Macdonald and Nate Zuercher \u2013 share a playlist of favorite tunes with USA TODAY.\n\nClairo \u2013 \"Alewife\"\n\nJudah: The song reminds me of my childhood. Makes me feel like I'm in a movie walking. There's a certain nostalgia in her voice that's timeless to me.\n\nFrightened Rabbit \u2013 \"Break\"\n\nJudah: I love how the song goes from an organic indie/almost-Ramones feel to programmed drums in the verse. You can feel the heart in singer Scott Hutchison in this one.\n\nGabi DiPace \u2013 \"Should\u2019ve Known Better\"\n\nJudah: This song has a certain swagger that's different and fun. You can't help but bump in the chorus. Attitude and melody hit me hard on this one.\n\nMajical Cloudz \u2013 \"Downtown\"\n\nBrian: This is my favorite love song. It is so mysterious and free. I connected to it from the first time I heard it and haven\u2019t stopped listening since.\n\nI\u2019m With Her \u2013 \"Overland\"\n\nBrian: Powerhouse band, strong women with great songs, making a difference.\n\nElephant Micah \u2013 \"Still Life Blues\"\n\nBrian: It took time for me to realize the power, talent and thoughtfulness behind this songwriter. This is some of the truest art I\u2019ve found. Would recommend.\n\nIron & Wine - \"Thomas County Law\"\n\nNate: This song is quintessential Iron & Wine for me. I love the calmness this brings to me and find myself going to this song often when I need to relax. Strong yet simple melody throughout as well.\n\nCHVRCHES - \"Clearest Blue\"\n\nNate: Anytime I go skate, snowboard or play soccer, I start the playlist with this song. Basically, it gets me hyped and complements my mood when I'm doing what I love. The build throughout is perfect.\n\nDesert Star - \"Carissa\"\n\nNate: We learned about this song from playing Rocket League together on the bus. Anytime it comes on, the volume goes way up. We like to say it's the perfect road trip song with your squad.\n\nTwin Shadow - \"Brace (featuring Rainsford)\"\n\nNate: This is my most recent find that I can't stop playing. Another song that just makes you feel good. I need more of that and gravitate big time towards anything that lifts my spirits. Love this song.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/11/playlist-judah-and-lions-favorite-songs/3774691002/", "description": "Supporting their recently-released\u00a0third album \"Pep Talks,\" Judah and the Lion kicked off a U.S. headlining tour last month.", "authors": ["Usa Today", "Published A.M.
