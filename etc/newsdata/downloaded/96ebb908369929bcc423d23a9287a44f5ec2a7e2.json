Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nChina has been embroiled in four months of demonstrations, which began in June in opposition to a proposal to a bill that would allow individuals to be extradited from Hong Kong to China, and the response was swift and unyielding. The Chinese Basketball Association announced it would sever ties with the Rockets, as did Tencent, the NBA\u2019s rights holder in China, and the Rockets\u2019 Chinese sponsors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNBA\u2019s handling of Daryl Morey-China maelstrom shows that money matters most\n\nBrooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai, the billionaire co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, said that Morey\u2019s tweet was \u201cso damaging to the relationship with our fans in China\u201d and that \u201cthe hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.\u201d Tsai also referred to Hong Kong as a \u201cthird-rail issue\u201d in Chinese politics.\n\nMorey, who deleted his original Twitter post, sought to tamp down the response. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention.\u201d\n\nThe NBA also tried to assuage Chinese concerns, issuing its own statement that said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that Morey\u2019s tweet had \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China.\u201d Although the league did not discipline Morey, its statement noted the NBA\u2019s \u201cgreat respect for the history and culture of China\u201d and did not mention the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlmost immediately, though, the NBA came under attack from politicians and commentators who viewed its response as overly deferential to the Chinese government and lacking in support for pro-democracy voices. The NBA, which has sought to cultivate an inclusive and progressive reputation under Commissioner Adam Silver, was accused of hypocrisy and of putting its financial interests over its ideals.\n\n\u201cI thought the NBA was proud to be the \u2018wokest professional sports league\u2019?\u201d wrote Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on Twitter. \u201cI guess that only applies to speaking out on American politics and social issues. \u2026 China regulating speech in America is dangerous.\u201d\n\nJenkins: Don\u2019t be mad at the NBA. Hundreds of U.S. companies have sold out to China\u2019s regime.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) added: \u201cThe NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights. In response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe outrage came from both sides of the aisle.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, a Democratic presidential candidate from Texas, said that, \u201cThe only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights,\u201d terming the league\u2019s statement \u201can embarrassment.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom,\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote on Twitter. \u201cI stand with the people of Hong Kong in their pursuit of democratic rights. I stand with Americans who want to voice their support for the people of Hong Kong. Unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe NBA\u2019s China-Daryl Morey backlash, explained\n\nThis type of outcry is a rarity for the NBA under Silver, whose tenure has been marked by his even-keeled personality, his player-friendly approach and the league\u2019s significant financial growth. Silver has drawn praise for his 2014 expulsion of former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was caught making racist remarks on tape, his support of issues like LGBTQ rights and for reaching new labor agreements with the National Basketball Players Association without work stoppages.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe NBA\u2019s global aspirations rely heavily on China, with Silver regularly referring to the country, and its population of 1.4 billion people, as a top priority and, as he said in June, an \u201cenormous opportunity.\u201d Silver\u2019s predecessor, David Stern, began laying roots in the country with a partnership with CCTV in 1987, the NBA began hosting hosted exhibition games in China in 2004, and the NBA officially opened its NBA China office in 2008. The Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets will play exhibition games this week in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\nMeanwhile, superstars such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James have regularly made summer pilgrimages to promote their sneakers. Numerous NBA players, including former Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade, have signed promotional deals with Chinese sneaker companies rather than American brands. And NBA teams including the Rockets and Golden State Warriors have designed and worn jerseys aimed specifically at the Chinese audience.\n\nAccording to league figures, 640 million Chinese viewers consumed NBA content during the 2017-18 season, and the NBA\u2019s most recent five-year extension with Tencent was reportedly worth $1.5 billion. Tencent announced that 21 million people used its service to watch the decisive game of the 2019 NBA Finals \u2014 topping the viewership number in the United States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Morey affair the first time that Silver and the NBA have had to publicly reckon with China as a polarizing political power broker. In his first public comments on the subject, Silver, who was in Tokyo on Monday in advance of exhibition games between the Rockets and Toronto Raptors this week, attempted to clarify the league\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cAs a values-based organization that I want to make it clear \u2026 that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,\u201d Silver said, according to the Kyodo News.\n\nThe commissioner also acknowledged that there have been \u201cfairly dramatic [economic] consequences\u201d from Morey\u2019s tweet, and that \u201cit will take some time to heal some of these issues\u201d with the Chinese government and businesses.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI would like to believe \u2026 that many sports fans that don\u2019t pay all that much attention to politics, or to the situation in China and Hong Kong, may as a result know far more now about the situation,\u201d Silver concluded, according to Japan Times.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Morey had stopped short of issuing a formal apology, Rockets star James Harden, the 2018 NBA MVP, did just that.\n\n\u201cWe apologize,\u201d said Harden, who has traveled to China in the past to promote his Adidas sneakers. \u201cWe love China. We love playing there. They show us the most support and love. We appreciate them as a fan base. We love everything they\u2019re about. We appreciate their support they give us, individually and as an organization.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nNBA, Rockets face backlash in China over general manager\u2019s tweet\n\nLeBron James continues fight against NCAA, announcing support of Fair Pay to Play Act\n\nEven with a lift from Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Clippers plan to keep doing the dirty work\n\nKyrie Irving shines a light on an overlooked issue in the NBA: grief\n\nAfter a long summer, LeBron James eases back onto center stage with the Lakers\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox\n\nAD", "description": "Adam Silver's progressive NBA arrives a crossroads.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mftcUW50y3RP3Kt91mThghDimmc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PIEHCMXI5QI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
