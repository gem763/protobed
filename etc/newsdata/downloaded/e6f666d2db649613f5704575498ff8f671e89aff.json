According to Brian Olsavsky, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Amazon exceeded the $800 million the company said it would spend in the second quarter to put one-day shipping in place, made an additional large investment in the third quarter, and there are more costs to come.\n\n\u201cSo, as we head into Q4 we\u2019ve added what\u2019s just nearly a $1.5 billion penalty in Q4 year-over-year for the cost of shipping, which essentially is transportation costs, the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, things like adding additional roles and shifts in our warehouses,\u201d he said, according to a FactSet transcript.\n\nSee: Amazon earnings fall for first time in more than two years, stock drops in late trading\n\nIt\u2019s been worth every penny, according to Olsavsky.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re very pleased with the customer response to one-day,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see it in our revenue acceleration and also in our unit growth acceleration.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also become a valuable perk for Prime members.\n\n\u201cWe have seen Prime members increase their orders, spend more,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cSo they must also see it as a real help to them in their daily lives.\u201d\n\nOlsavsky said the company also continues to invest in AWS.\n\nEven if the numbers are eye-popping, analysts are upbeat about the investments. Charlie O\u2019Shea, Moody\u2019s Amazon analyst, called the spend \u201cstrategically-necessary.\u201d And besides that, the company has the money.\n\n\u201cWe continue with our view that Amazon\u2019s robust liquidity, with over $42 billion in cash and short-term investments, as well as AWS\u2019 steady $2.3-plus billion in operating income per quarter, provides the company with significant runway to continue with its myriad, necessary investments,\u201d he said.\n\nKeyBanc Capital Markets highlights how much Amazon stands to gain from the one-day shipping build-out.\n\nAnd: Walmart isn\u2019t waiting for Halloween, will launch holiday deals on Friday\n\n\u201cWith a significant amount of retail share up for grabs given ongoing traditional retail bankruptcies, Amazon is clearly taking outsized share,\u201d analysts led by Edward Yruma wrote. \u201cInvestment to support one-day and AWS will help drive sustained long-term growth and we expect leverage over the medium term.\u201d\n\nThe one-day offering is also another differentiator between Amazon and its chief rival, Walmart Inc. WMT, +0.15%\n\n\u201cThe ability to effectively offer the entire Prime assortment on one-day differs from Walmart.com\u2019s more focused selection,\u201d KeyBanc said.\n\nKeyBanc rates Amazon stock overweight with a $2,200 price target.\n\nJack O\u2019Leary, senior analyst at Edge by Ascential, also notes the way in which Amazon is transforming retail.\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s investments in providing a superior shopping experience through delivery speed today are driving the retail business to grow massively (faster than any quarter in the past two years),\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cIt appears that in typical Amazon fashion the company is positioning itself at the head of the pack competitively by sacrificing some declines in its stock price today.\u201d\n\nBut Amazon isn\u2019t just positioning itself as a retail leader, according to Susquehanna Financial Group.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re buyers on the dip, as we remain positive on Amazon,\u201d analysts led by Shyam Patil wrote. \u201c[W]e see the company as a long-term secular grower with leadership positions in three large-growth markets \u2013 e-commerce, cloud and advertising.\u201d\n\nWatch: Here are 3 tips for picking retail stocks\n\nEven the stalled Amazon Web Services, or cloud business, isn\u2019t a large concern because \u201cit\u2019s still early days and we expect AWS growth and margins to remain sold in the near and long term.\u201d\n\nSusquehanna rates Amazon stock positive and shaved its price target to $2,200 from $2,250.\n\nBenchmark analysts aren\u2019t deterred by the stock reaction either.\n\n\u201cWe still believe that our thesis of more aggressive upfront investment over a shorter time horizon remains on track, although, as is often the case with Amazon, we significantly underestimated the level of that upfront spend,\u201d Daniel Kournos, a Benchmark analyst, wrote.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Hasbro says tariffs are to blame for earnings miss\n\n\u201cOnce the bulk of the one-day push is completed, however, we see Amazon re-establishing a deeper competitive moat that should yield in several additional years of market share gains. We\u2019d be buyers on weakness.\u201d\n\nBenchmark rates Amazon stock buy with a $2,100 price target.\n\nAmazon stock has rallied 16% for the year to date, the Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +1.54% has gained 25.7%, and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.47% is up 20.5% for the period.", "description": "Amazon earnings fell short of expectations but analysts think the heavy investments in one-day shipping and AWS are a positive.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT700_amazon_ZG_20191021105542.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
