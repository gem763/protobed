Some trains will continue on to Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh on the existing west coast main line, while York, Durham and Newcastle will be served via the northern part of the east coast line.\n\nYou may be strongly against the project \u2013 especially in a week when the chairman of HS2, Allan Cook, published what he called a \u201cStocktake\u201d of the project. He warns of \u201can upward revision of the funding envelope\u201d, which in English means that phase one will cost 40 per cent more than the original estimate of \u00a327bn, and phase two 25 per cent on top of the original \u00a328.6bn.\n\nLet\u2019s call it \u00a380bn \u2013 a staggering amount of money for a rail project in a country where many people rarely or never travel long distances by train.\n\nCook also called the plan to open phase 1 as planned in 2026 \u201cnot viable\u201d. Trains are now timed to depart on the full London-Birmingham line five years behind schedule, with the Leeds and Manchester arms as late as 2040.\n\nTwelve years from now, there could be two ceremonies involving high-speed rail in adjacent countries. The French will be marking half a century since the first Train \u00e0 Grande Vitesse ran on the line from Paris to Lyon, in 1981. The British, meanwhile, may be celebrating the completion of the first domestic-only high-speed link.\n\nHopelessly optimistic budgets and schedules for big rail projects are nothing new; the recent electrification of the Great Western lines and London\u2019s much-delayed Crossrail project were both seriously botched.\n\nYet HS2, or something like it, will be desperately needed in generations to come. It is not about accelerating the journey from Birmingham to London by 20 minutes, though that will have some environmental and social benefits in shifting travellers from rail to road.\n\nThe purpose of the new line is to increase the capacity of a 19th-century railway network to make it fit for the 21st century \u2013 or however much of it remains when the line finally opens.\n\nEach inter-city train transferred from existing lines to High Speed 2 will release, it is claimed, \u201ccapacity for 11 new fast commuter or freight trains\u201d by taking out the fastest services.\n\nCancelling the whole thing, into which at least \u00a37bn has already been sunk, would undoubtedly be a vote-winner in constituencies where the bulldozers are poised. It would also play well in regions such as southwest England, South Wales and East Anglia which will see no direct benefit from HS2.\n\nBut most of the tens of millions of people in the 2040s, 50s and beyond who will need the increased capacity are not yet on the electoral register.\n\nAt a time when some politicians appear desperate for power, and hence votes, at any cost, visionary infrastructure projects are as dispensable as distinguished parliamentarians.\n\nHS2 has thus far been poorly specified, planned and managed. Like our politics, it is a mess. But it is still essential.", "description": "Even through the mist of the French Pyrenees, a mile above sea level and 600 miles south of Westminster, Britain looks a mess.
