Johnson immediately moved to throw them out of the party and banned them from standing as Tory candidates at the next election.\n\nAD\n\nBritish House of Commons passes bill seeking to avert a no-deal Brexit in another blow to Boris Johnson\u2019s plan\n\nNow, if every opposition and independent member of Parliament in the 650-strong House of Commons were to oppose Johnson on any piece of Brexit legislation, he would be defeated by 43 votes.\n\nWith his majority shattered, Johnson now faces questions over his ability to secure Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union at the end of October, something he has repeatedly promised to do.\n\nJohnson may face no choice but to seek an election and attempt to secure a majority that would allow him to take back control.\n\nAD\n\nA government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to give a frank assessment, said \u201can election is now inevitable\u201d because Johnson can no longer set out his legislative priorities.\n\n\u201cWe have \u2014 literally \u2014 no majority,\u201d the official said.\n\nLawmaker blasts Boris Johnson in Parliament for \u2018racist\u2019 remarks about Muslim women\n\nHowever, under the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act, Johnson first needs to secure the support of two-thirds of all lawmakers to permit an early election in mid-October.\n\nAD\n\nThis is no easy feat, as it will require the Labour Party and purged Conservative lawmakers to vote in favor of triggering the snap poll.\n\nThe Conservative Party would also need to find new candidates to field in the 21 seats Johnson relinquished Tuesday.\n\nWhile his allies are confident of beating Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in an election, there are no guarantees Johnson would even emerge from an election with a Commons majority. The risks are certain, and the outcome is unclear.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news\n\nAD", "description": "A total of 21 Conservative lawmakers rebelled against their newly installed leader and were sacrificed in the process.", "authors": ["Laura Hughes", "Laurence Stern Fellow"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uUS3SX8LVcG7WlZloPk21b71dKw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X6HLBDGPKAI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
