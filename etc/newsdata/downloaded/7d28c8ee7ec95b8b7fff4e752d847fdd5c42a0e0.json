Alan and Tisha went public with their romance in May at his co-star Sam Aston (Chesney Brown) and Briony Aston\u2019s wedding, and the pair\u2019s friends were relieved they no longer had to keep their romance a secret.\n\nAlan was previously married to Lucy-Jo Hudson but the pair split after nine years of marriage. The former couple have six-year-old daughter Sienna-Rae together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe much loved actor is currently in the midst of a bubbling storyline in Coronation Street which has seen a teaching assistant and nanny move in with him and his wife Fiz in order to look after troublesome Hope.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBut she clearly has other motives as she has been plotting against Fiz, something which will undoubtedly cause friction and dramatic scenes for Alan to portray.\n\nAmid that,. he is also heavily rumoured to be one of the contestants on this year\u2019s I\u2019m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! following in the footsteps of co-star Jennie.
