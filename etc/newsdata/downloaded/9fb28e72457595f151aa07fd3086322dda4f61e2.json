Baghdadi, the founder of the Islamic State, otherwise known as \u201cISIS\u201d or \u201cISIL,\u201d oversaw the extrajudicial killings of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig and Muadh al-Kasasbeh capturing international attention in addition to the slaughtering of hundreds more.\n\nThe obituary from the Washington Post however, framed one of the world\u2019s most brutal terrorists as an \u201caustere religious scholar.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State, dies at 48,\u201d read the initial published headline from one of America\u2019s leading newspapers.\n\nThe headline published was actually the second headline picked by the paper, which at first read, \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Islamic State\u2019s \u2018terrorist-in-chief,\u2019 dies at 48.\u201d\n\nThey had it right the first time. The Washington Post changed the headline on its Al-Baghdadi obituary from \u201cIslamic State\u2019s terrorist-in-Chief\u201d to \u201caustere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State.\u201d pic.twitter.com/cs243EVz7W \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 27, 2019\n\nThe headline has since been changed to \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, extremist leader of Islamic State, dies at 48.\u201d\n\nWhile the Post eventually made the headline somewhat better, though they were spot-on the first time, the obituary still reads remarkably well-disposed touting the ISIS leader\u2019s academic credentials and career building his vast terrorist empire responsible for torturing countless innocent people.\n\nThe Post, after chronicling Baghdadi\u2019s rise to power, waited until the 40th paragraph of the obituary to mention Baghdadi was also a serial rapist for much of the last decade.\n\n\u201cLater, former hostages would reveal that Mr. Baghdadi also kept a number of personal sex slaves during his years as the Islamic State\u2019s leader, including slain American hostage Kayla Mueller and a number of captured Yazidi women. U.S. officials corroborated the accounts,\u201d the Post wrote.", "description": "The obituary from the Washington Post framed one of the world\u2019s most brutal terrorists as an \u201caustere religious scholar.\u201d", "authors": ["Tristan Justice"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WaPo-Terrorist-Headline-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
