Trump thanked Russia, Iraq, and Turkey\u2014for allowing U.S. forces to operate in an area of northwestern Syria, where they had never had much presence\u2014as well as the Syrian Kurds, leaving unmentioned the fact that, given his abandonment of them earlier this month, they are unlikely to be so helpful in the future.\n\nBut the killing is less of a big deal because, not least, as Trump has boasted on previous occasions, ISIS had already been severely reduced in stature and was no longer such a centralized organization. Its members still carried out terrorist activities, but Baghdadi no longer directed them to the degree he once had.\n\nBruce Hoffman, a specialist on terrorism at Georgetown University, said in an email Sunday morning that Baghdadi\u2019s death may merely drive \u201cthe remaining ISIS forces into an alliance with al-Qaida\u201d\u2014which has experienced a bit of a revival in recent years.\n\nISIS began, after all, as a splinter group from al-Qaida. The two groups still have many ideological similarities; \u201ctheir estrangement,\u201d Hoffman said, \u201cwas always the product of an outsize clash of egos of its two leaders\u201d\u2014Baghdadi and al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri\u2014\u201crather than substantive divisions or core beliefs.\u201d A modus vivendi between the two groups is particularly plausible, Hoffman said, because Baghdadi\u2019s strategy ultimately proved far less successful than \u201cal-Qaida\u2019s long-standing counsels for strategic patience, which have resulted in both its resilience and consolidated presence in Idlib province\u201d\u2014the last remaining rebel stronghold in Western Syria.\n\nIn any case, Hoffman added, the militants in both al-Qaida and ISIS \u201cregard their struggle as divinely ordained,\u201d so \u201cthe death of a mere mortal\u201d\u2014even one as charismatic as Baghdadi or bin Laden (who, at the time of the raid on his compound, was much more powerful)\u2014\u201cis inconsequential.\u201d\n\nIn short, Trump\u2019s triumphalism may prove as short-sighted as that of his predecessors. Hoffman said, \u201cThis has always been the problem with our approach to counterterrorism: the temptation to declare victory again and again, especially given our electoral cycle\u201d\u2014for instance, George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner after toppling Saddam Hussein in 2003, and the celebrations surrounding Barack Obama\u2019s announcement of Osama bin Laden\u2019s killing in 2011.\n\nTrump\u2019s special brand of triumphalism might also sour what could otherwise have been a much-needed moment of success amid the House impeachment hearings. When Obama appeared on nationwide television, for nine minutes, to announce bin Laden\u2019s death, some Republican critics denounced him for what they saw as his self-congratulation. Trump tweeted at the time, \u201cStop congratulating Obama for killing bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed bin Laden.\u201d\n\nCut to seven years later, almost to the day, and, in his 50-minute Sunday-morning news conference, not only did Trump take credit for killing Baghdadi, he reveled in the act, describing the terrorist leader as \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way\u201d as special forces and dogs chased him to the end of a tunnel, where he detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three of his children, dying \u201clike a dog \u2026 like a coward.\u201d\n\nTrump also boasted that killing Baghdadi was a bigger deal than killing bin Laden\u2014which is to say, that Donald Trump is a bigger deal than Barack Obama. \u201cThis is the biggest there is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country.\u201d\n\nTrump also claimed credit, as he has in the past, for warning about bin Laden in a book published a year before the 9/11 attack, when as he put it, almost no one had heard of al-Qaida. (He also, while on the subject of his books, noted that he\u2019d written 12 of them, and \u201call of them did well.\u201d) But in fact, this book, called The America We Deserve, only fleetingly mentioned bin Laden, who, in any case, was already quite well-known as the result of his earlier attack on the World Trade Center in 1993.\n\nTrump may hope to garner some political favor from the killing. But the gain is likely to be minimal. Harry Enten, CNN\u2019s pollster, tweeted Sunday morning that the bin Laden raid gave Obama an \u201capproval boost\u201d that \u201clasted maybe a few weeks\u201d\u2014and that raid was widely viewed as the final revenge for bin Laden\u2019s murder of 3,000 Americans. Baghdadi is less of a household name, and Trump\u2019s repeated claims that he\u2019d destroyed ISIS already may have blunted the killing\u2019s political impact.\n\nFinally, and most puzzling, following his announcement, Trump repeated his claim that U.S. troops control Syria\u2019s oil fields (which is untrue) and that he might invite companies like ExxonMobil to come in and drill (which they have neither the legal right nor the remotest desire to do). All of which raises, once again, the question: Is Trump putting more troops in Syria? Is he taking them out? And, whatever the case may be, why?", "description": "Trump\u2019s triumphalism may prove as short-sighted as that of his predecessors.", "authors": ["Fred Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/75ee6453-08a0-4db0-b072-8fcf2279002c.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=2390x1593&offset=100x0", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
