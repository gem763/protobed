They all lit and burned quickly and strongly enough to set the seat on fire,' added Ms Duffin.\n\nThe firefighters at the test expected the crisps to go out before they had a chance to set the seat on fire \u2014 they were amazed.'\n\nIn the second stage of the research, the duo explored how quickly a lit bag of crisps could set fire to a car seat \u2014 a good substitute for home furnishings like sofas and which could safely be set alight outside\n\n'When forensics teams go to investigate arson they're looking for an accelerant, such as petrol,' said Ms Brownlow, who is the former head of Head of Crime Scene Training for the Metropolitan Police.\n\n'Also, someone looking to start a fire who is carrying a can of petrol stands out. No one's going to look twice at someone with a bag of crisps, and the evidence destroys itself.'\n\n'This is especially helpful if someone is trying to make a deliberate fire look accidental. Criminals have presumably worked this out and told each other.'\n\nThe researchers noted that there was no statistically significant difference in how different types of crisp burn.\n\nFire investigators were alerted to this method of fire-starting by colleagues in the prison service, who reported being familiar with the technique\n\nWith their initial study complete, the team will now be investigating whether a bag of crisps could stay alight long enough to start a fire were it thrown through a letterbox.\n\n'That sort of malicious damage is more common with \"amateur\" arsonists, rather than covering up a crime,' said Ms Brownlow.\n\n'I\u2019m not convinced a thrown pack would stay lit for long enough but this is why we test things, you never know.'\n\n'We\u2019ll need to build a rig, a kind of mock hallway, with a door and letterbox and various floor types so we can compare burn patterns on the back of the door.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were presented at the International Conference on Fire Safety Science and Technology, which was held in London from September 25-26.", "description": "To investigate how a bag of crisps can serve as an accelerant, forensic scientists\u00a0at the University of Greenwich, London, experimented by setting light to 10 different types of crisp.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/12/19489110-0-image-a-24_1570622243613.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
