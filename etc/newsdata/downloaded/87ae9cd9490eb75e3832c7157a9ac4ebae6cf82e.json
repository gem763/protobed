REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\nThe probe is focused on a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate unsubstantiated allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden, a top contender for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential election, and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe younger Biden, 49, denied doing anything improper in past work for a Ukrainian energy company, in an interview with ABC News that aired on Tuesday.\n\nBut he expressed regret that his association with the Burisma Group gave \u201csome very unethical people\u201d an opening to \u201cto act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That\u2019s where I made the mistake.\u201d\n\nKent, a deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for U.S. policy toward six former Soviet republics including Ukraine, arrived on Capitol Hill wearing a red bow tie and ignored shouted questions from reporters.\n\nKent appeared after receiving a congressional subpoena after the State Department directed him not to testify, an official involved in the impeachment inquiry said.\n\nHis appearance comes one day after Trump\u2019s former Russia adviser, Fiona Hill, gave three House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry details of a high-level meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian officials that included her then-boss, former national security adviser John Bolton, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, according to a person familiar with the testimony.\n\nHill recounted that Sondland raised the issue of investigations and that she and Bolton became alarmed that he was referring to the investigation into the Bidens, the person said. The pair left the meeting and Bolton advised her to consult with John Eisenberg, the top NSC lawyer.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Bolton was similarly troubled by activities toward Ukraine being coordinated by the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, along with other administration officials.\n\n\u201cGiuliani\u2019s a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\u201d Hill quoted Bolton as saying, according to the newspaper.\n\nA Bolton spokeswoman said he would have no comment on the testimony.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U.S. ally to dig up dirt on Biden after withholding $391 million in U.S. security aid intended to help combat Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of Ukraine. Zelenskiy agreed to investigate. Trump eventually allowed the aid.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and defended his request to Zelenskiy. The elder Biden also denied wrongdoing.\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, is due to testify later in the week, in response to a congressional subpoena.\n\nGiuliani, a former New York City mayor, faces a Tuesday deadline to produce documents related to the Ukraine matter subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee. He has not said whether he will comply.\n\n\u2018DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN\u2019\n\nOn Friday, Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, defied a State Department order to refuse to cooperate with the House probe, giving scathing testimony in which she accused the Trump administration of recalling her from Kiev based on false claims.\n\nAccording to State Department emails contained in a package of material shared with congressional staff last month and later seen by Reuters, Kent told colleagues that Yovanovitch had become the target of a \u201cclassic disinformation operation.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch in her Friday appearance denied Giuliani\u2019s allegations that she provided a \u201cdo not prosecute list\u201d to Ukrainian officials to protect Biden and others.\n\n\u201cOne key sign of it being fake is that most of the names are misspelled in English \u2014 we would never spell most that way,\u201d Kent said in the email to colleagues.\n\nKent suggested the department push back by \u201ccircling in red all the misspellings and grammar mistakes and reposting it,\u201d as the U.S. Embassy in Moscow has done to counter propaganda.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nKent, who majored in Russian language and literature at Harvard, has held several jobs requiring him to grapple with corruption in Ukraine, which ranks 120th of 180 nations in a Transparency International corruption perceptions index.\n\nBefore taking up his current job, Kent served as the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev from 2015 to 2018 and as the senior anti-corruption coordinator in the State Department\u2019s European Bureau from 2014 to 2015.\n\nOne former U.S. official said Kent had been among the most vigilant officials within the State Department in reporting on corruption in Ukraine and in seeking to combat it.", "description": "The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump on Tuesday questioned George Kent, a U.S. career diplomat who has spent much of his career fighting corruption in Ukraine and elsewhere.", "authors": ["Jonathan Landay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441133090&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E18W", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
