Previously, it had only been available for Facebook and beta testers.\n\nWe here at The Verge have already used it to create our first filter, which you can see and share through Instagram\u2019s mobile app by going to The Verge\u2019s Instagram account (@verge) and tapping on the face icon.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to know how to make your own filter for use on Instagram, grab your phone and computer and let\u2019s go.\n\nStart your project\n\nIt\u2019s always good to start with a sample project as a jumping-off point. In this case, we\u2019re going to create a Face Distortion effect.\n\nDownload & install the latest version of Spark AR Studio onto your computer (we\u2019re using v68 for this how-to). It\u2019s available for both Mac and Windows.\n\nYou\u2019ll be greeted by a splash screen that has a ton of great starter projects to explore. I encourage you to open them all up and poke around if you want.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to start this sample project, go to the Samples tab and choose Face Distortion.\n\nSave your project to a local folder by going to \u201cFile\u201d > \u201cSave.\u201d\n\nModify your filter\n\nNow that you\u2019ve opened up a sample project, you\u2019ll probably want to make a few changes.\n\nOn the left side of the window in the \u201cScene\u201d tab, find and select \u201cfaceMesh_distortion.\u201d\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\nOn the right side of the window, find \u201cDeformation.\u201d\n\nMake sure the Deformation window is expanded.\n\nUnder \u201cBlend Shapes\u201d tweak any of the sliders to adjust the facial distortion.\n\nGo ahead \u2014 create a nightmare!\n\nUse the filter on your own video\n\nUp to this point we\u2019ve been using the default sample video to see our effect. Let\u2019s change it to see how our effect looks on other face types. If you have a webcam you can even preview it on yourself in real time. Here\u2019s how to change the input video:\n\nOn the far left edge of the window, find and click the camera icon.\n\nFrom the selection of faces presented, choose one.\n\nIf you have a webcam attached to your computer, you will see a button for it just above the faces. Choose it for a live interactive preview.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\nYour effect should automatically update and be applied to the new face. Make any additional adjustments you\u2019d like then save the project.\n\nExport your filter\n\nNext, we\u2019ll export a final file we can use to upload to Facebook and publish to either Facebook or Instagram (you can only choose one). Here\u2019s how:\n\nFrom the file menu choose \u201cExport.\u201d\n\nA window will pop up showing how much space your filter will use on different types of devices.\n\nIf everything is all green and checked, hit the \u201cExport\u201d button. (Note: You can still export your file if not all the device types are checked, but that may cause problems along the way.)\n\nChoose a save location you\u2019ll be able to easily find later and choose \u201c.arexport\u201d as the file type.\n\nOpen a web browser and make sure you\u2019re logged in to the Facebook / Instagram account where you want to publish the effect.\n\nNavigate to https://www.facebook.com/sparkarhub/\n\nYou\u2019ll be greeted with an intro screen. Keep going \u2014 you can check a box to skip this page the next time you navigate here.\n\nIn the upper right of the page click the \u201cUpload Effect\u201d button.\n\nChoose the platform (Facebook or Instagram) you want the effect to live on (in this case, Instagram), and name your filter. Hit \u201cNext\u201d at the bottom of the screen to advance.\n\nIn the \u201cEffect Icon\u201d section, drag and drop an image you\u2019d like to represent your filter on Instagram.\n\nIn an Explorer / Finder window, find the file you exported earlier.\n\nDrag and drop it into the \u201cEffect File\u201d section of the page.\n\nTick the legal agreement checkbox saying you have all the necessary rights.\n\nChoose \u201cUpload\u201d and \u201cContinue.\u201d\n\nVerify the information that pops up and hit \u201cContinue.\u201d\n\nTest your filter\n\nYou\u2019ve now uploaded your filter and it\u2019s almost ready. You just need to do some testing first. On the next page, you\u2019ll be greeted with two options: \u201cPreview in the app\u201d and \u201cGet a preview link.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreview in the app\u201d will let you test your filter for 60 minutes from the account you\u2019re currently logged in to. \u201cGet a preview link\u201d will give you a link you can send to friends, family, or co-workers so that they can test your filter; it can only be used 200 times in a single day, which should be plenty. (Note: I\u2019ve personally had issues using the \u201cPreview in the app\u201d option, so I recommend using the link.)\n\nEither way, go ahead and test to your heart\u2019s content.\n\nAlso, you\u2019ll want to send that preview link to yourself (either via email, chat, or however you like), because you\u2019re going to need it later.\n\nPublish your filter\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to publish your new filter for the world to see, here\u2019s how:\n\nHit the \u201cNext Steps\u201d button at the bottom of the screen. (If you\u2019ve left the previous page, you can find it easily by going back to facebook.com/sparkarhub.)\n\nChoose a category. Our test filter could easily fit into \u201cSelfies,\u201d \u201cFunny,\u201d or even possibly \u201cWeird & Scary.\u201d\n\nRemember that preview link that you sent yourself? Go get your phone, click on the preview link, and take a short video of your effect in action with Instagram. This demo video will show people what your filter does without having to download it. Once you\u2019re happy with the video, make sure the file is accessible on your computer.\n\nOkay, go back to your computer. Drag and drop the video into the \u201cDemo video\u201d section of this page. Hit \u201cNext.\u201d\n\nChoose when your filter will go live. You can have it start immediately upon approval, or set a start and end date. Hit \u201cNext.\u201d\n\nOn the \u201cReview Information\u201d page, type up a quick summary of what your effect does. This is only for review purposes and is not public.\n\nHit next and you\u2019ll be able to review everything you\u2019ve done so far. Make sure everything is right and hit \u201cSubmit for Review\u201d at the bottom of the page. Reviews take about one business day, but could potentially take longer.\n\nCongratulations, you\u2019re all done! Now all you need to do is wait for your filter to be approved. When it is, your friends and followers will be able to find your filter on the app. Now go out and make some awesome stuff!", "description": "A tool that lets you create custom face filters and other excellent effects for Instagram, Spark AR Studio is now available to all users.
