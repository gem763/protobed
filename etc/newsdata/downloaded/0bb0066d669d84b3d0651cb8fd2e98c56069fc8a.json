Turkey aims to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northeast Syria to resettle 3.6 million Syrian refugees currently residing in Turkey, as well as to combat Kurdish groups it considers terrorist organizations.\n\nSome of those groups were instrumental in the U.S.-led fight against ISIS in Syria. The Kurds also fear Turkey is trying to remake the demographics of the region by flooding it with Sunni Arabs.\n\nVice President Mike Pence met with Erdogan in Ankara Thursday morning to discuss a possible ceasefire with the Kurds, which Erdogan has repeatedly rebuffed.\n\n\u201cWe will never declare a ceasefire,\u201d said Erdogan on Wednesday. \u201cThey are pressuring us to stop the operation. They are announcing sanctions. Our goal is clear. We are not worried about any sanctions.\u201d\n\nPence was joined on his trip by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan received a letter on October 9 from President Trump urging him to make a deal with the Kurds, and threw the letter into the trash bin, according to the BBC.\"You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people,\" Trump wrote, \"", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9vXAIqvf664GaZzMo0FHQw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/reccep-erdogan-campaign.jpg?fit=1024%2C597&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
