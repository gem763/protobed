The latest evidence is the ejection of two fans from a game in Philadelphia -- not in China, mind you -- over their pro-Hong Kong signs and chants:\n\nThe moment Sam Wachs and his wife are escorted out of the @sixers preseason game against a Chinese basketball team for yelling \u201cFree Hong Kong.\u201d @6abc pic.twitter.com/3HlZxKXDzs \u2014 Christie Ileto (@Christie_Ileto) October 9, 2019\n\nHere are the controversial signs. I know, earth shattering right? Obvious why the NBA would have a problem with this. Thanks to @Christie_Ileto for sending me this photo: pic.twitter.com/Y1GydtGked \u2014 Sam Wachs (@gogowachs) October 9, 2019\n\n\n\nDo the 76ers -- a team named after the year the Declaration of Independence was signed in their city -- or the NBA have policies against political signs at games? Doesn't seem so:\n\nAccording to the Wells Fargo Center\u2019s website, \u201csigns must be in good taste and appropriate for the event.\u201d The site also notes the \u201cpolicy is subject to change based on the Wells Fargo Center management\u2019s discretion and without notice.\u201d The NBA\u2019s policy prohibits \u201cobscene or indecent messages on signs or clothing,\u201d but does not mention political statements.\n\nEven if some rule is dredged up to 'justify' this move, Allahpundit makes a good point: \"Should the NBA have a 'no political signs' [policy], by the way? A Twitter pal notes that it\u2019s rich that the world\u2019s \u201cwokest professional sports league\u201d has no problem with activism among coaches and players, up to and including political messages being worn on warm-up attire before the game, while the plebes who pay their salaries are forbidden to broadcast their own views during NBA events.\" He's right. Players have worn league-sanctioned, politically-charged slogans on their bodies during warm-ups -- with the media applauding along. How's the media handling this controversy. As you read this, remember that ESPN is heavily financially invested in the success of NBA basketball:\n\nAn ESPN exec sent a memo to staffers mandating that coverage of the Morey/China story focus on basketball and avoid political discussions about China and Hong Kong https://t.co/kuXIiQwznh \u2014 Max Tani (@maxwelltani) October 8, 2019\n\n\n\nBy the way, it's not just the NBA and ESPN selling out and bowing to Communist China's sensitivities. Read this story about a gaming company, or this one about Apple, or this astonishing one about a prominent hotel chain:\n\nThis anecdote from Josh Rogin is INSANE. Does corporate America really know what they are doing? pic.twitter.com/8fOmPCtYpi \u2014 Jay Cost (@JayCostTWS) October 9, 2019\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, back to basketball. The Chinese government in Beijing is clearly turning the screws hard on the NBA, making it abundantly clear just how financially painful things will get if any other league-affiliated people \"step out of line\" by defending democracy in Hong Kong (I'm sure this lesson applies equally, if not more, to condemnations of the regime's endless human rights abuses):\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 NBA Cares event in Shanghai was canceled Wednesday just hours before it was scheduled to begin, according to multiple reports. The cancellation is the latest fallout from a recent tweet by Rockets GM Daryl Morey that showed support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. The NBA said the cancellation off the Lakers event, which was supposed to benefit the Special Olympics, was not its decision. This came a day after the Chinese government canceled the Nets\u2019 NBA Cares event. Though there has been no word about whether the two preseason games would be canceled, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV previously said it will no longer air the games because they vehemently disagreed with comments Silver made Monday in Japan backing Morey\u2019s right to free speech. \u201cWe\u2019re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver\u2019s claim to support Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d CCTV is also reviewing all of its cooperation and exchanges involving the NBA, it said in a statement posted to CCTV Sports\u2019 official social media account.\n\nThe message is crystal clear: Sorry, special olympians, an American tweeted something about Hong Kong, so your event is canceled. Also, here's what doesn't count as free expression. It is not subtle who the bad guys are here. The question is whether American corporations, organizations and brands will continue to effectively take their side, or tap dance, for profit. This is a deeply disconcerting but important point:\n\nI think as free marketers we really need to grapple with this. In the past, a lot was written about exporting democratic values via commerce, but less consideration was given to prospect that we'd be importing anti-democratic values, such as censorship. https://t.co/MDT6w6KGoF \u2014 Philip Klein (@philipaklein) October 8, 2019\n\n\n\nI'll leave you with an excellent move from the Trump/Pompeo State Department, as well as a spectacular \"apology\" from the creators of South Park over their devastating recent episode on American companies' craven boot-licking:", "description": "Disgrace..10/09/2019 14:31:44PM EST.", "authors": ["Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/282/270e4897-dfe4-4044-943a-bf82f9227ed3.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
