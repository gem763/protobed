Refuse to take part in the sale of assault weapons. 2. Stop processing transactions for gun sales online & at gun shows without background checks. 3. Stop doing business with gun & ammo manufacturers who produce or sell assault weapons.\u201d\n\nThe former Texas congressman\u2019s commentary, which included an online petition, did not define \u201cassault weapons\u201d and appeared to use it in reference to cosmetic features on rifles.\n\nSemi-automatic weapons are available to civilians while fully automatic weapons are reserved for military personnel.\n\n\u201cIf enough of us make our voices heard now, we will force banks and credit card companies to act. Add your name to this petition we\u2019re sending Visa, Mastercard, and the big banks,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke continued.\n\nThe tweets came hours before Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate in Houston on ABC and Univision.\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos, Linsey Davis, David Muir and Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos will moderate the event, which features 10 candidates, from 8-11 p.m. EDT.\n\nCredit cards have enabled many of America\u2019s mass shootings in the last decade\u2014and with Washington unwilling to act, they need to cut off the sales of weapons of war today. https://t.co/yqLHMF0EWD \u2014 Beto O\u2019Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 12, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
