Brian Schatz says the Federal Transit Administration approved the proposal submitted earlier this year.\n\nThe recovery plan was submitted by the city transportation authority to demonstrate Honolulu has a workable proposal for completing the 20-mile (32-kilometer) rail line.\n\nThe line was originally estimated to cost $5.2 billion and be completed next year, but the transit administration now projects completion in 2026 at a cost of $9.2 billion.\n\nSchatz says the approval recognizes efforts to improve accountability and control costs.\n\nRapid transportation authority Executive Director Andrew Robbins says the approval clears the way for the release of $744 million in grant funding.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Honolulu Star-Advertiser, http://www.staradvertiser.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal agency has approved a rail recovery plan submitted by the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
