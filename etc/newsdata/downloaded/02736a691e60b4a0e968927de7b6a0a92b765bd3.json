Specifically, it\u2019s releasing Giphy Arcade, a platform for making, hosting, and playing \u201cmicrogames\u201d constructed out of gifs.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how in the heck Giphy and games go together, don\u2019t worry \u2014 it took me by surprise too. But Giphy is one of those companies that seems to be trying to expand beyond its original mandate, and in this case it\u2019s leveraging its massive library of gifs as assets for bite-sized games.\n\nNick Santaniello, Giphy\u2019s senior product engineer, said in a statement:\n\nWhen exploring what games could look like for GIPHY, we knew the experience had to be quick, shareable, and accessible for everyone, including people who don\u2019t necessarily have a history with gaming. With GIPHY Arcade, we\u2019ve created an experience that provides not only instant fun for the player, but also a new way to add personalized expression and entertainment to conversations as they\u2019re happening.\n\nGiphy Arcade games are designed to be made, played, and shared in a matter of seconds. They\u2019re not complex \u2014 most of the ones already created look like Flappy Bird meets a YTMND fired out of Nyan Cat\u2019s backside. You can find them all by visiting the Giphy Arcade landing page here. Everything is free and simple to access.\n\nUsers can also \u201cremix\u201d games, meaning put a new spin on the gameplay by changing up the in-game assets. Don\u2019t wanna bust bricks? You can change up the game by using its template and selecting specific things to replace the bricks, sliding paddle, and bouncy thing. So if, for example, you wanted to change a brick buster into a game in which Ken from Street Fighter bounces a disco ball off of pizza slices in front of Wendy\u2019s posterboard\u2026\n\nYeah, this stuff is trippy as heck.\n\nWhile anyone can make these microgames, I can see this being something businesses take advantage of \u2014 Wendy\u2019s has already partnered with Giphy on this experiment, because of course it has. I can definitely see a social media-savvy business putting together a few games for its website or something like this.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much pleasure the average user is going to get out of it \u2014 this is something I could see myself getting tired of pretty quickly, both as a player and a remixer. One thing that could potentially save this? Memes\u2026 lots and lots of memes.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FGiphy-Arcade.jpg&signature=3c8357ba6dad41273a3b9639f1026dab", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
