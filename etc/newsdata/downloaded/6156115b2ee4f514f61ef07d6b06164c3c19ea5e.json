Salt infiltrates the drinking water, and imbues the vegetables with a sharp tang.\n\nIncreasing salinity almost wiped out the local shrimp industry back in the mid-90s, and these days many local fishermen have switched from collecting shrimp to hunting the more climatically resilient mud crab.\n\nBut even as they adapt, locals remain extremely vulnerable. Mud crabs are becoming increasingly scarce, and as farmers venture into the mangrove forest to collect them, they are falling prey to gangs of pirates who kidnap them for ransom, forcing their families into debt. Loan sharks have spotted the opportunity and are now preying on the villagers too.\n\nSomehow they are surviving, but many are looking for a way out.\n\n\u2018If the heat increases, the shrimp will die\u2019\n\nAround Datina Khali, the aquaculture industry dominates the landscape, with sleepy villages surrounded by an earthen patchwork of shrimp ponds and soft-shell crab farms.\n\nIn the stifling early morning heat, Shuvendro Nath Mistry is surveying his two hectare shrimp farm, as a group of women knee-deep in water pull weeds from his ponds.\n\n\u201cThe shrimp haven\u2019t grown well this year. In this hot weather it is harder for them to grow,\u201d admits Mistry, his arms crossed over his bare chest. \u201cIf the salinity increases the shrimp will not die, but production will decrease. But if the heat increases, the shrimp will die.\u201d\n\nToday the crippling temperatures are one of the shrimp farmers\u2019 biggest concerns. Mistry is all too aware of the precarious situation of his trade, and watchful for the next problem that could bring the industry to its knees \u2013 as happened 20 years ago, when white spot disease spread through the farms, brought on by the increased levels of salt.\n\nDuring the crisis, farmers noticed that mud crabs were naturally invading the decimated shrimp ponds, and seized the opportunity for some marginal returns. As a result, some deserted their old stocks and switched to crab cultivation instead.\n\nAlthough still nascent and smaller than the now recovered shrimp industry, Bangladesh\u2019s crab production has proved a success story. With rising international demand from countries such as China, Singapore and Malaysia, the export of mud crab from the south Asian nation reached $24m (\u00a319m) in 2015\u201316.\n\nNow the area\u2019s aquaculture is divided between shrimp and soft-shell crab farming, and collecting wild mud crabs from the Sundarbans for export, or to be fattened up in local farms.\n\nYet the irony is that amid a shift to a more climatically resilient industry, those on its frontline, the fishermen who venture into the mangrove forest, find themselves more and more at risk.\n\nKidnappings \u2018up to once a week\u2019\n\nFor years, small pirate gangs have roamed the watery capillaries of the Sundarbans, hiding out in the dense forest as they stake out fishermen to kidnap and hold for ransom.\n\nThere are a few horror stories \u2013 of fishermen being severely beaten, or having their Achilles tendons sliced \u2013 but for the most part the piratical target is financial.\n\nAs soon as they capture a victim, the pirates head for areas within the forest known for the best cell reception, sometimes climbing trees for a clear line, so they can call a terrified victim\u2019s family to demand a ransom via electronic transfer. So organised are some they even have their own business cards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so stressful when the men get kidnapped,\u201d exclaims Shefali Bibi, a pickle maker and fisherman\u2019s wife from Datina Khali, dressed in a bright yellow and purple sari. \u201cThose are the worst days. I can\u2019t eat, or sleep or bathe.\u201d\n\nIn the past decade, pirates have twice kidnapped her husband and held him for ransom, each time causing immense financial strain.\n\nOf about 1,600 fishermen and crab collectors in Datina Khali, almost all have been kidnapped once \u2013 others up to four or five times.\n\nTo address the rampant banditry, the government has in recent years launched a huge crackdown, offering pirates lucrative sums to surrender.\n\nRoughly 29 pirate groups brandishing more than 400 firearms have given themselves up since 2015, with the last batch reportedly surrendering in November 2018, when the Bangladeshi prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, declared the Unesco-listed Sundarbans \u201cpirate free\u201d.\n\nBut while the situation is significantly better, local fishermen say there are at least three pirate gangs still operating, with kidnappings occurring up to once a week.\n\n\u201cThere are fewer pirate groups now, but the situation is unchanged. If they find us we still have to pay them,\u201d says 32-year-old Moniral Islam Gazi, a crab collector who was captured this April. \u201cI am not really scared of being caught because I have faced it a lot, but I am scared about where to find the money.\u201d\n\nIf pirates capture them as they eke out a meagre existence collecting mud crabs and wild honey, they are quickly plunged into vicious cycles of debt.\n\nBack in the village, when a family member receives a ransom call they are thrust into a state of panic. Most have little, if any, savings. With payments ranging anywhere from 20,000 to 250,000 Bangladeshi taka (\u00a3182 \u2013 \u00a32,270), many are forced to take loans.\n\nOf almost half a dozen crab collectors interviewed, all but one had a loan. Many had multiple loans, from local businessmen, village loan sharks and microcredit agencies.\n\n\u201cSometimes they need a loan just to pay for their forest permit and supplies,\u201d explains Srikander Ali, a local crab broker at the nearby Katakhali fish market, who reckons the kidnappings still occur between eight and 10 times a month.\n\n\u201cI also give them loans for the ransoms. If they get caught it affects my business too,\u201d he says, glancing at baskets of wriggling mud crab stacked against the wall, soon to be trucked to Dhaka for live export. \u201cI estimate that about 80% are in a pretty bad financial position.\u201d\n\n\u2018A lot of fear factors\u2019\n\nSitting opposite her husband in their canoe, as he gently scoops up his line from the khaki waters, Henna Bibi is pragmatic about her choices.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of fear factors in the forest,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if we get scared we won\u2019t be able to raise our children.\u201d\n\nFor safety, they set out into the forest in numbers. But these days there is also the problem of supply \u2013 once bountiful, wild mud crabs are becoming increasingly hard to find.\n\n\u201cThe number of crabs has dropped noticeably in the last six years,\u201d says Muhammad Didar Boxfaksis, 65. \u201cOn a good day, we can get 5\u20137kg, but 15 years ago it was double that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe used to throw the smaller crabs back,\u201d agrees his neighbour, Sobed Ali. \u201cNow, we take everything we can find.\u201d\n\nMojibar Rahman, who is researching a PhD on crab cultivation at the Bangladesh Agricultural University, says the shortage is likely to result from over-collection.\n\nTo make the industry more sustainable, the government needs to invest in mud-crab hatcheries, he suggests, instead of being almost entirely reliant on wild stocks.\n\n\u201cThe crab industry is still underdeveloped because of a lack of culture technology and a lack of seeds [baby crabs],\u201d he explains, adding that some farmers have also shied away from crab cultivation because, in the Muslim-majority nation, crabs are viewed as haram (forbidden).\n\nWith the myriad challenges before them, some local fishermen are looking for a way out. Many of the younger men have already left, seeking work in urban brick factories.\n\nThe older fishermen claim that if it weren\u2019t for the pirates they would make more than enough, but Sobed Ali is tired of waiting, and luckily has a small amount of money to invest in adapting his business.\n\n\u201cThe money I make, I don\u2019t end up using it myself, it ends up as pirate bail,\u201d says the exasperated father of three. \u201cIt makes my life miserable.\u201d\n\nWith their savings from harvesting crab and selling pickles, and a loan from a Japanese trading company, Ali and his wife have converted a piece of land they own in the village into a small soft-shell crab farm.\n\n\u201cI have to secure my children\u2019s future, so that\u2019s why I am starting the soft-shell crab farming,\u201d says Ali, as he hammers together an adjacent shelter in the fading light.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my sons to go into the forest like me. It\u2019s too risky. Hopefully, if this goes well, I can stop going in too.\u201d", "description": "Bangladesh\u2019s rising seas and the constant threat of kidnapping mean that families in one of the world\u2019s largest mangrove forests face a fight to survive", "authors": ["Kate Lamb", "Allison Joyce"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ae58f24ac0f3e4cd57962565129f8c146ef848c/0_231_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a3a7732856f2e5b6742cadd96f5fdc4e", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
