Elijah Cummings died at 68 after complications from \"longstanding health issues,\" his office confirmed. USA TODAY\n\nHe listened to us, respected us, trusted us and was truly proud of us. He had so much left to accomplish, but he has left it for us to complete.\n\nAs current and former congressional staff of the late Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, we had the great honor and privilege of working with him over the course of more than two decades.\n\nMany public figures have praised the chairman in recent days, extolling his unmatched integrity, courageous leadership and commitment to service and justice. To these well-deserved tributes, we would like to add our own eulogy, based on our experience working by his side.\n\nHe was inspiring, both in public and even more so in private. He brought moral clarity to everything he did, and his purpose was pure \u2014 to help those among us who needed it most. He taught us that our aim should be to \u201cgive a voice to the voiceless,\u201d including families whose drinking water had been poisoned, sick patients who could no longer afford their medicine and, most of all, vulnerable children and \u201cgenerations yet unborn.\u201d\n\n'What feeds your soul?'\n\nWhether in a hearing room full of members of Congress or in a quiet conversation with staff, his example motivated us to become our best selves in the service of others.\n\nHe was genuine. He insisted on personally interviewing every staff member he hired so he could \u201clook into their eyes.\u201d Each of us has a personal memory of sitting down with him for the first time, and it was like nothing we had experienced before. He would ask why we were interested in public service, how we thought we could contribute and what motivated us.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. (Photo: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThen he would lean in and ask in his low baritone voice, \u201cBut \u2026 what feeds your soul?\u201d\n\nMore than a few of us left those interviews with tears in our eyes, perhaps feeling that we had learned more about ourselves than about him. He made that kind of personal connection with everyone he met, from the people of his district, to witnesses who testified at hearings, to whistleblowers who reported waste, fraud or abuse. Since his passing, we have been inundated with messages from many whose lives he touched.\n\nBe efficient and seek 'higher ground'\n\nHe was demanding. He would boast that he had the hardest working staff in Congress and that he sometimes would call or email us in the middle of the night, which was absolutely true. His directive to be \u201ceffective and efficient in everything you do\u201d still rings in our ears.\n\nDear President Donald Trump: Let me tell you about my ex-boss Elijah Cummings\n\nIn exchange, he listened to us, respected us and trusted us. He made sure we knew he was truly proud of us \u2014 memories we each now cherish. The result of his unwavering support was fierce loyalty from every member of his staff. We committed to doing everything in our power to fulfill his vision.\n\nHe was a unifying force, even in this era of partisanship. He would command order with a sharp rap of his gavel, elevate debate by noting that \u201cwe are better than that\u201d and urge all of us to seek \u201cnot just common ground, but higher ground.\u201d\n\nGuided by his faith and values, he would look for and bring out the good in others, forming bridges through human connection.\n\nWe are here 'only for a minute'\n\nHe fully grasped the moment in which we are now living. He invoked history books that will be written hundreds of years from now as he called on us to \u201cfight for the soul of our democracy.\u201d As he said, this is bigger than one man, one president or even one generation.\n\nHe was acutely aware of his own transience in this world. He reminded us repeatedly that we are here \u201conly for a minute\u201d and that all of us soon will be \u201cdancing with the angels.\u201d\n\nBridging the gap: All college students should take a mandatory course on black history and white privilege\n\nHe would thunder against injustice, or on behalf of those who could not fight for themselves, and he would vow to keep battling until his \u201cdying breath.\u201d He did just that. His final act as chairman came from his hospital bed just hours before his death, as he continued to fight for critically ill children suddenly in danger of deportation.\n\nHe had so much left to accomplish, but he has left it for us to complete. As he told us presciently, \u201cThese things don\u2019t happen to us, they happen for us.\u201d\n\nGrateful he was part of our destiny\n\nIt is difficult to describe the emptiness we now feel. His spirit was so strong, and his energy so boundless, that the void is devastating.\n\nBut, of course, he left us with instructions: \u201cPain, passion, purpose. Take your pain, turn it into your passion, and make it your purpose.\u201d He lived those words, and he inspired us to do the same.\n\nSometimes, after a big event, he would take us aside for a quiet moment and say, \u201cI just want to thank you for everything you do and for being a part of my destiny.\u201d\n\nToday, we thank him for being part of ours. And we commit to carrying forward his legacy in the limited time allotted to each of us \u2014 to give voice to the voiceless, to defend our democracy, and to always reach for higher ground.\n\nThe authors of this tribute are current and former staff of the late House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., whose funeral is Friday.
