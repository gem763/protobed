I could see no golden perch.\n\nAustralia launches emergency relocation of fish as largest river system faces collapse Read more\n\n\u201cIn a sense this is a cull of the carp, but there are some pretty big cod too.\u201d\n\nYates and McLeod said they were only able to see about 20 native Murray cod, a species listed as vulnerable in Australia, among the dead fish. They estimated between 2,000 and 5,000 fish had died.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really possible to count with any accuracy. I tried to count sections but there\u2019s a lot of bodies and mud and it was pretty hard to move around,\u201d said Yates.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s confronting is the size of them. There would not be one fish under two or three kilos. The Murray cod were probably small compared to what they could be. The carp look like big breeding age fish. It\u2019s actually great to have them out of the system.\u201d\n\nEuropean carp are an invasive species that damage ecosystems and push out native species, and are subject to a national program investigating ways to remove them.\n\nIn January, hundreds of thousands of native fish perished in three mass fish kills.\n\nYates said he thought the Lake Pamamaroo fish kill was down to a drying of the lake that left fish isolated.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s connected to the rapid drying of the lake system, but it\u2019s not caused by the blue green algae like the others. This is purely the lake dried out and there was a deeper part and the fish were trapped.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Screengrab from footage supplied by Rory McLeod of another mass fish kill event in NSW on Lake Pamamaroo.

We\u2019re facing another hot summer with very little water flowing through our rivers.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cFish deaths are common during summer but what we saw last year were a major wake-up call about the impact of the drought on our rivers.\u201d\n\nThe plan would provide any available environmental water to mitigate fish deaths, support emergency responses, keep a fish deaths database and \u201ccontribute to water quality monitoring programs\u201d that would identify risk areas.\n\nThe Greens water spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young attacked the plan, saying Coalition cuts to environmental flows in favour of irrigators meant there was \u201cno water for the fish to survive\u201d.", "description": "A small number of dead Murray cod also discovered at Lake Pamamaroo", "authors": ["Graham Readfearn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95f4ad2636bbb3fefe7d457ce85d2e6512dc3208/0_17_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=08a66448ce46598d5e028cdda5983b57", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
