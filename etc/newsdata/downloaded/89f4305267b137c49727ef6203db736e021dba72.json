The NBA has also received criticism from US politicians. Senator Ted Cruz said the league was guilty of \u201cassisting Chinese censorship\u201d by initially saying it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that Morey\u2019s tweet had caused offence in China.\n\nNBA's China reaction shows the league is only woke when it doesn't cost money Read more\n\n\u201cDaryl Morey, as general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right [to free speech] as one of our employees,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWhat I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.\u201d\n\nThose consequences are already becoming clear. CCTV said it will not show the games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets, who will play on Thursday in Shanghai and Saturday in Shenzhen. Basketball is wildly popular in China, with the Lakers drawing particularly strong support due to the presence of superstar LeBron James\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver\u2019s claim to support Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression,\u201d CCTV said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d The broadcaster is also reviewing all its cooperation with the NBA, according to the statement.\n\nSilver is going to Shanghai on Wednesday and said he hopes to meet with officials and some of the league\u2019s business partners there in an effort to find common ground. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to our interests [in China] and our partners that are upset,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.\u201d\n\nSilver said the NBA did not expect CCTV to cancel plans to show the Lakers-Nets games. \u201cBut if those are the consequences of us adhering to our values, I still feel it\u2019s very, very important to adhere to those values,\u201d Silver said.\n\nThe rift between China and the NBA started late last week when Morey tweeted a now-deleted image that read: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d in reference to months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the Chinese territory that has been mired in violence between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nEfforts were quickly made to defuse the impact. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and Morey returned to Twitter on Monday in an effort to clarify his original post. NBA streaming partner Tencent which has a $1.5bn contract with the league over the next five seasons said it would not show Rockets games and a sports website in China said it was no longer covering the team.\n\nFurther complicating the matter is the fact that China\u2019s best-known basketball player is Hall of Famer Yao Ming, who spent his NBA career with the Rockets. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which has said it is suspending its relationship with the Rockets in response to Morey\u2019s tweet. The CBA also canceled plans to have the G League affiliates from Houston and Dallas play preseason games in China later this month. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that together Yao Ming and I can find an accommodation,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut he is extremely hot at the moment, and I understand it.\u201d\n\nThe NBA\u2019s reaction to Chinese displeasure is jarring to some, given the fact that the league has won plaudits for encouraging its players to express their views on social issues they believe are important, such as police shootings of African Americans.", "description": "The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, is scrambling to appease sponsors and broadcasters in China while still preserving the league\u2019s progressive image", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2a90f8e1c8acbd443f8a2d7dfc59493dc3af7fa/0_66_5750_3450/master/5750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5bd416ed8fbfea3502d4b63f0f3e2669", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
