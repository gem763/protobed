According to IDC, shipments grew 3 percent year-over-year to 70.4 million units. Gartner tallied a 1.1 percent year-over-year increase to 68 million units.\n\nFor the second quarter in a row, Lenovo topped the list of vendors, while HP came in second, both Gartner and IDC reported. Dell rounded out the top three, followed by Apple and then Acer. The top three vendors all saw year-over-year growth, while Apple's shipments declined compared to a year prior. According to IDC, Apple's momentum dropped this quarter as the company faced supply constraints.\n\nGartner and IDC define the PC market slightly differently: Gartner's data includes desk-based PCs, notebook PCs and ultramobile premiums (such as Microsoft Surface), but not Chromebooks or iPads. IDC counts desktops, notebooks (including Chromebooks) and workstations, but not tablets or x86 Servers.\n\nIn the US, PC shipments totaled 14.8 million, according to Gartner, representing a 0.3 percent decline. IDC observed low single-digit growth in the US.\n\nGartner senior principal research analyst Mikako Kitagawa called the Windows 10 refresh cycle \"the primary driver for growth across all regions.\" IDC similarly said the refresh cycle should continue to drive commercial demand.\n\nIDC added that PC makers were pushing inventory in anticipation of higher tariffs on the way.", "description": "For the second quarter in a row, Lenovo topped the list of vendors, while HP came in second, according to both IDC and Gartner.", "authors": ["Stephanie Condon"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/12/22/156748e6-a430-436a-8a17-3d9315a1b041/thumbnail/770x578/e808bf86bcd0aa975f112c62489b4f91/q17-eoy-bestbuy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
