Adam Schiff for the way he has been handling the impeachment inquiry into President Donald J. Trump. Specifically, Rep. Gaetz says that Schiff has been \"distorting @POTUS \u2019s call with President Zelensky, Lying to the public about 'Russian collusion', and blocking members of Congress from attending impeachment depositions.\"\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi's impeachment resolution gives unprecedented power to the Intelligence Committee Chairman, Adam Schiff,\" Gaetz told reporters ahead of filing his complaint. \"That's deeply troubling to me for a few reasons. First, Adam Schiff has proven in this process that he cannot adhere to the fundamental principles of fairness. Second, and I would say most important for my work today, is that Adam Schiff has violated the ethical rules of the House of Representatives.\"\n\nI just filed an ethics complaint against @RepAdamSchiff over his handling of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\n\n\nSchiff has lied to the American people and abused his power.\n\n\n\nWe won't allow him to continue trampling the Constitution. pic.twitter.com/TA8ONY2OtN \u2014 Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) October 30, 2019\n\nCiting a series of rules that Gaetz alleges Schiff broke, the congressman adds that \"Schiff has lied to the American people and abused his power. We won't allow him to continue trampling the Constitution.\"\n\nThis complaint comes a day after Rep. Jim Jordan Ohio said that Rep. Schiff would not let Republicans on the Intelligence Committee question Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a key witness in the probe. \"When we asked [Vindman] who he spoke to after important events in July, Adam Schiff says, 'no, no, no, we're not going to let him answer that question,'\" Jordan said.", "description": ".10/30/2019 19:17:50PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/287/271242b3-0509-4f2a-b046-4fb1fb8cee86.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
