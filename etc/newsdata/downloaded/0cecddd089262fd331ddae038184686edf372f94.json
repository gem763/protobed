Top products that received GSP benefits were tyres, gold necklaces, fatty acids and leather handbags, the data showed.", "description": "U.S. removes tariffs for five Indonesian products", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_4_800x533_L_1413112066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
