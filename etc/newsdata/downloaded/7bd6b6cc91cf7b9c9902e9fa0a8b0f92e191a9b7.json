She shared the award equally with Indian-born American Banerjee and Kremer, also of the United States.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said their work had shown how poverty could be addressed by breaking it down into smaller and more precise questions in areas such as education and healthcare, and then testing solutions in the field.\n\nIt said the results of their studies and field experiments had ranged from helping millions of Indian schoolchildren with remedial tutoring to encouraging governments around the world to increase funding for preventative medicine.\n\n\u201cIt starts from the idea that the poor are often reduced to caricatures and even the people that try to help them do not actually understand what are the deep roots of (their) problems,\u201d Duflo told reporters in Stockholm by telephone.\n\n\u201cWhat we try to do in our approach is to say, \u2018Look, let\u2019s try to unpack the problems one-by-one and address them as rigorously and scientifically as possible\u2019,\u201d she added.\n\nThe team pioneered \u201crandomized controlled trials\u201d, or RCTs, in economics. Long used in fields such as medicine, an RCT could for example take two groups of people and study what difference a treatment makes on one group while the other group is only given a placebo.\n\nApplied to development economics, such field experiments found for example that providing more textbooks and free school meals had only small effects, while targeting help for weak students made a big difference to overall educational levels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a prize not just for us but for the whole movement,\u201d Banerjee later told a joint news conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where they both work. Kremer is a researcher at Harvard University.\n\nCiting Banerjee\u2019s methods as having transformed classroom teaching in state schools in New Delhi, the Indian capital\u2019s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Twitter that it was a \u201cbig day for every Indian\u201d.\n\nMALE-DOMINATED\n\nThe team have notably been associated with the \u201cTeaching at the right level\u201d (TarL) program which has helped 60 million children in India and Africa and focuses on math and reading skills for primary school pupils.\n\nAbhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, two of the three winners of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics, stand together at a news conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., October 14, 2019.

Yet another found that making the renewal of teacher contracts dependent on pupil grades produced better scores, while reducing the pupil-teacher ratio had little impact.\n\nDuflo said the importance of the two most commonly cited approaches to tackling poverty - foreign aid and freeing up trade with poor countries - had often been \u201coverstated\u201d.\n\nWhile the United Nations estimates that global poverty has been cut by more than half since 2000, it says one in 10 people in developing regions still live on less than $1.90 a day. In sub-Saharan Africa, that proportion rises to 42%.\n\nDuflo said it was clear that better designed policies were having an impact on alleviating poverty worldwide.\n\nBut some economists, while saluting their work, said it did not address the bigger inequalities in the global economy which left millions stuck in poverty regardless of local intervention.\n\n\u201cI would congratulate them but still put that caveat that poverty is artificially made by human beings who put up systems that deny others the opportunity to realize their full potential,\u201d said James Shikwati, head of the Nairobi-based Inter Regional Economic Network think tank.\n\nAsked whether Duflo\u2019s award was an attempt to redress the gender imbalance in the prize\u2019s history, Peter Fredriksson, chairman of the Nobel Committee for Economic Sciences, said it showed that women were now more present in economics.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nDuflo remarked that it came at an \u201cextremely important and opportune time\u201d for women in a sector that has traditionally been very male-dominated.\n\n\u201cWe are at a time when we are starting to realize in the profession that the way that we (treat) each other privately and publicly is not conducive all the time for a very good environment for women,\u201d she said.\n\nThe 9 million Swedish crown ($915,300) economics prize is a later addition to the five awards created in the will of industrialist and dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, established by the Swedish central bank and first awarded in 1969.", "description": "U.S.-based economists Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer won the 2019 Nobel Economics Prize on Monday for work fighting poverty that has helped millions of children by favoring practical steps over theory.", "authors": ["Simon Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440817295&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1JM", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
