REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s internal watchdog is investigating how the agency handled a congressional request for President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, it said on Friday.\n\nThe Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal, requested the investigation, said Richard Delmar, Treasury\u2019s acting inspector general.\n\nNeal asked the office of the inspector general to \u201cinquire into the process by which the department received, evaluated, and responded to the committee\u2019s request for federal tax information,\u201d Delmar said. The watchdog was \u201cundertaking that inquiry,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Republican president has refused to make his tax returns public, unlike his predecessors. The House Ways and Means committee launched a probe into Trump\u2019s taxes earlier this year.\n\nThe internal probe was first reported by the New York Times, which earlier reported that Trump and his family business had underpaid federal taxes for years.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a member of Trump\u2019s cabinet, refused Neal\u2019s April request for six years of Trump\u2019s individual and business federal tax returns. Neal subpoenaed the returns, and Mnuchin rejected the subpoena.", "description": "The U.S. Treasury Department's internal watchdog is investigating how the agency handled a congressional request for President Donald Trump's tax returns, it said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437151101&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931HY", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
