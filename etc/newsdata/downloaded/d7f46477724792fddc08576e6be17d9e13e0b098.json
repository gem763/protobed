Several administration officials have failed to testify to committees involved in the inquiry.\n\nMrs Pelosi said the resolution in the Democratic-controlled House would also \"ensure transparency and provide a clear path forward\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump impeachment: The most dramatic week yet\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the vote supported Mr Trump's contention \"that Democrats were conducting an unauthorised impeachment proceeding\".\n\nShe said Mrs Pelosi's party was \"refusing to give the President due process, and their secret, shady, closed-door depositions are completely and irreversibly illegitimate\".\n\nLast week some Republicans - who argue there has been a lack of transparency in the proceedings - disrupted and delayed a hearing being held behind closed doors.\n\nOn Monday, Charles Kupperman, who was a deputy to former national security adviser John Bolton, failed to appear before a House panel involved in the inquiry.\n\nDemocrats want to hear Mr Kupperman's testimony on Mr Trump's 25 July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nA rough transcript of the call has revealed that Mr Trump urged President Zelensky to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden, the frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in next year's election, as well as Mr Biden's son.\n\nQuick facts on impeachment\n\nImpeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office.\n\nIf the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial.\n\nA Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber.\n\nOnly two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted and removed.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.", "description": "Nancy Pelosi says it will \"ensure transparency\", but the White House calls the process \"shady\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5EFA/production/_109441342_trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
