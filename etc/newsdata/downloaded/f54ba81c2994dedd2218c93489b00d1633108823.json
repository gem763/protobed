Journalists can continue with the usual reporting practice in Hong Kong without fear of being affected,\u201d Mohammaed said.\n\nDemonstrators rallied in the neighborhood of Tsim Sha Tsui on Sunday in the wake of the injunction taking effect, holding signs that read \u201cJustice will prevail\u201d and \u201cOppose the Communist Party, fight against totalitarianism.\u201d\n\nThere was heavy police presence throughout and officers fired tear gas and pepper spray at demonstrators as Hong Kong Police said demonstrators had attacked officers with umbrellas and other \u201chard objects.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s protests took place in the same district where police last week sprayed a mosque using water cannons filled with blue dye meant to identify demonstrators, but later said the mosque was \u201caccidentally affected.\u201d\n\nPolice again sprayed demonstrators in the area, without the blue dye, and fired more tear gas as they moved through Tsim Sha Tsui.", "description": "Oct. 27 (UPI) \u2014 Pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong took to the streets again on Sunday, shortly after a court enforced a ban on publishing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
