For a club already cruising toward a third consecutive AL West title, it was a move made for October - where the Yankees figured to be a powerful opponent.\n\nAfter Verlander and Cole dominated the Tampa Bay Rays in the first two games of the AL Division Series, it was Greinke\u2019s turn in the postseason. He allowed three homers and six runs in 3 2/3 innings of a 10-3 loss to the Rays.\n\nThat prompted manager AJ Hinch to try to close out that series with Verlander on short rest in Game 4. When that didn\u2019t work, Cole had to pitch the decisive Game 5 against Tampa Bay only two nights before the ALCS started against the rested Yankees.\n\nVerlander will be on regular rest for Game 2 on Sunday night. He also pitched the second game of the 2017 ALCS against the Yankees, a 124-pitch complete game when the Astros scored in the bottom of the ninth for their second consecutive 2-1 win to start that series.\n\nCole will go in Game 3 at New York on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important not to overreact to anything,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cAnd credit the Yankees for having a really good first game. We\u2019ll see them tomorrow.\u201d\n\nGreinke has allowed five homers and nine runs over 9 2/3 innings in his two playoff starts for the Astros, and his ERA in 13 career postseason starts remains at 4.58 - more than a run higher than his regular season mark.\n\n\u201cIt was different, I guess,\u201d Greinke said about this loss compared to his start against the Rays. \u201cSome ways it was worse, some ways it was better.\u201d\n\nAsked what was better, he responded, \u201cI threw more innings this time than last time.\u201d\n\nIn 10 starts for the Astros during the regular season, Greinke was 8-1 with a 3.02 ERA with only six homers allowed in 62 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Astros traded four prospects to get Greinke on the same day he made his last start for the Arizona Diamondbacks, at Yankee Stadium in a game Masahiro Tanaka started for New York. Both got no-decisions in that game, a 7-5 win by the Yankees in which Greinke struck out seven and allowed two runs over five innings. Greinke was in the visiting clubhouse after the rain-shortened outing when he learned he\u2019d be dealt.\n\nTanaka was also on the mound Saturday night, relying heavily on his splitter and benefiting from two double plays to face the minimum 18 batters while allowing only one hit through his six innings.\n\n\u201cHe lived on the edges and missed barrels. He\u2019s very good, and we didn\u2019t do anything offensively,\u201d third baseman Alex Bregman said. \u201cI think everyone is frustrated when we don\u2019t win because we know we are a better offense.\u201d\n\nAfter Bregman drew a leadoff walk in the fifth, when the Astros were down only 1-0, he slipped trying to get back to first and got doubled up on a strong throw by Aaron Judge after his running catch in the right-center gap.\n\nThe following inning, Gleyber Torres went deep against Greinke. Two batters later, Giancarlo Stanton homered into the Astros bullpen in right-center to make it 3-0.\n\nGreinke allowed three runs and seven hits over six innings. He struck out six without a walk, throwing 54 of 83 pitches for strikes.\n\nThe Astros suffered their first home shutout loss since June 27 and ended a streak of 30 consecutive games with a home run. They had homered in their first five playoff games after going deep in the last 25 games of the regular season, in the same year that the Yankees set a major league record by homering in 31 games in a row.\n\n\u201cWe know we have a good team. Turn the page,\u201d Yuli Gurriel said. \u201cToday was a bad day. Tomorrow we come out like we always do and go for the win and go 1-1.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Houston's added ace is still looking for his first playoff win with the Astros after getting taken deep again.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/alcs_yankees_astros_baseball_47193_c0-886-1933-2013_s1200x700.jpg?d36da50b8dc68f8f76973debe792706d8691888b", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
