I felt like the past season I lost that enjoyment side of it but I feel like this summer has been huge for me. Just the work I\u2019ve been putting in, I kinda fell in love with putting that work in again and I\u2019ve been in the gym every day working and the results have been paying off so I\u2019m excited for the season to start.\n\nSimmons, the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2016, has helped lead the Sixers to the second round of the NBA playoffs two straight seasons after making his debut in 2017. He was the Rookie of the Year that season and an All-Star for the first time last season. Simmons has averaged 16.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 7.9 assists and signed a $170 million, five-year contract extension in July.\n\nPhiladelphia is 101-58 in regular-season games when Simmons plays. He has had 22 triple-doubles in the past two seasons, tied for third most in the league with Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic and trailing Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook (59) and the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 LeBron James (26).\n\nSimmons also has had 80 double-doubles over the past two seasons.\n\nBut the one knock against Simmons has been his reluctance to shoot long jumpers and 3-pointers. He\u2019s 0 for 18 from beyond the arc, so defenses often focus on taking away his ability to drive to the basket and dare him to shoot.\n\nHe\u2019s up for the challenge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to be who I am as a player, continue to develop, keep working,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt\u2019s a process. It takes time. Obviously, people always want to see results straightaway but that\u2019s not how things work.\u201d\n\nSimmons decided to focus on improving his game instead of playing for the Australian team at the FIBA World Cup earlier this month in China. He rediscovered his love for basketball during those long hours in the gym and admitted the criticism weighed on him at times.\n\n\u201cI think sometimes you kind of get too deep into it where you listen to other people which should never be the thing you do unless they\u2019re giving you positive feedback or trying to help you get better because there\u2019s a lot of negativity out there,\u201d Simmons said, pointing to various social media platforms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge once you kind of block that out, you don\u2019t really care, you kinda go out there feeling free. You don\u2019t care if you miss a shot because everyone misses a shot so that\u2019s one of the things that I think this summer I got back to how I was as a player just playing and doing what I love at a high level.\u201d\n\nDespite being a lightning rod for criticism in Philadelphia, Simmons says he enjoys playing in front of a passionate fan base.\n\n\u201cI love being in Philadelphia. I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is the perfect place for me. I just handle (criticism) how it comes.\u201d\n\nSimmons heard plenty of boos after a poor performance in Philadelphia\u2019s first-round series opener against Brooklyn in April. He had nine points, seven rebounds, and three assists and shot 1 for 5 from the free throw line in a loss. Afterward, Simmons said: \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna boo, then stay on that side.\u201d\n\nSimmons answered with his second career playoff triple-double in Game 2, finishing with 18 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds as Philadelphia reeled off four straight wins. He looks back at it as a learning experience.\n\n\u201cI had a terrible first game and I loved it when people are tweeting me saying all these negative things because the next game I came out (and played better),\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt kinda fires me up a little.\u201d\n\nWhy does he even pay attention to the critics flexing their keyboard muscles?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to avoid. It\u2019s hard to not see,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI\u2019ve done a better job of not watching certain things in terms of what people are saying but that was a good example of people not giving me positive feedback and I had to respond.\u201d\n\nThe Sixers revamped their roster in the offseason, losing Jimmy Butler and J.J. Redick and adding Al Horford and Josh Richardson and retaining Tobias Harris to play with Simmons and fellow All-Star Joel Embiid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re locked in. We\u2019re ready to play,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in the gym. We\u2019ve been there early. We\u2019re competing trying to get each other better from the rooks to the guys who are vets. I think it\u2019s going to be an exciting year for the 76ers.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Videos of Ben Simmons making jumpers flooded social media over the summer and the All-Star point guard is ready to take his game to another level when the Philadelphia 76ers open camp next week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Maaddi"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
