I have no words to talk about Leo, he\u2019s from another world, everything he does, he does well.\u201d\n\nBarcelona took the lead after just two minutes when the ball bounced fortuitously to Lenglet in the area and he crashed an effort in off the crossbar.\n\nOlivas levelled after 15 minutes when Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen could only parry a free kick, with the defender deflecting the ball home.\n\nMessi, however, helped Barcelona take control with a perfect pass for Vidal before the Argentine scored his fourth goal in four matches in all competitions and 100th under coach Valverde.\n\nThe number 10 set up Ansu Fati after the break but the 16-year-old\u2019s shot was kept out by Valladolid\u2019s former Barcelona goalkeeper Jordi Masip.\n\nLuis Suarez had a goal disallowed for offside before Messi struck again in the 75th minute, turning brilliantly before driving beyond Masip.\n\nMessi then set up Suarez with a well-judged through-ball, which the Uruguayan dispatched with aplomb.\n\n\u201cThey are very good and they don\u2019t let you off the hook, Messi worked wonders,\u201d said Valladolid captain Michel. \u201cYou just have to applaud (Messi) and enjoy him.\u201d", "description": "Barcelona captain Lionel Messi scored two goals and set up two more as the Catalans thrashed Real Valladolid 5-1 to move top of La Liga on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446323855&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1Y4", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
