Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) speaks to reporters after a briefing on a packet from the State Department\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The cryptically worded request marked urgent from the State Department\u2019s independent watchdog set Congress on edge.\n\nThe message, according to Steven A. Linick, the department\u2019s inspector general, was that he needed to meet \u2014 and right away \u2014 with senior congressional staff members to give them copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine. He signaled that they could be relevant to the House investigation into whether President Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nSome Democrats prepared for an explosive revelation that might show top administration officials had tried to obstruct their work. Speaker Nancy Pelosi told lawmakers on a caucus conference call that news reports were confirming that the heart of the briefing was about the White House retaliating against State Department staff who complied with the investigation. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, called Linick\u2019s request \u201csignificant\u201d and told lawmakers to \u201cstay tuned.\u201d\n\nSo what congressional aides received \u2014 a roughly 40-page packet of documents sheathed in a manila envelope decorated with cursive script and manipulated to look aged, with a return address portraying that it had come from the White House \u2014 may have been a bit of a letdown.\n\nThe packet included documents laying out a record of contacts between Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and Ukrainian prosecutors, as well as accounts of Ukrainian law enforcement proceedings. Some of it was established fact and some was unsubstantiated speculation that cast the Bidens in a bad light.\n\n\u201cWe thought this was about something else that the press had widely reported on,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., told reporters as he emerged from the chamber reserved for classified briefings. \u201cInstead, we got this.\u201d\n\nRaskin, apparently the lone member of Congress to attend the briefing \u2014 its original audience was intended to be aides \u2014 promptly assumed the role of narrator and myth-debunker, brandishing the dossier in disgust for good measure.\n\n\u201cA series of hallucinatory propagandist suggestions,\u201d he said.\n\nThere were more questions remaining than answers Wednesday. The packet contained a mysteriously curated collection of conspiratorial memos, news clippings and pages photocopied so poorly they were barely legible, according to a review of the dossier. The papers, contained in folders that appeared to be from a Trump hotel, were delivered to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s office in May \u2014 care of his secretary \u2014 by an unknown sender. The inspector general also included a series of emails between State Department officials that were not in the original file.\n\nThe memos referred to names that have played prominently in recent weeks, including Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine; Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor general of Ukraine; Hunter Biden; and George Soros, a frequent target of conspiracies.\n\nPerhaps most interestingly, a number of the memos listed a New York address \u2014 the Park Avenue office belonging to Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani confirmed Wednesday that the documents summarizing his interviews with the Ukrainian prosecutors were produced by a \u201cprofessional investigator who works for my company.\u201d Previously, Giuliani had recounted the interviews in a manner similar to that reflected in the documents. And he had previously described how his team had produced interview summaries modeled after those used by FBI agents.\n\nBy the end of the day, some lawmakers, like Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, were calling for further action.\n\n\u201cWe also need to understand Secretary Pompeo\u2019s role, given that it appears that he discussed these documents with at least one of his top aides and that the documents were distributed at the highest levels of the State Department,\u201d Menendez said.\n\nBut others, like Raskin, had reached a somewhat more cynical conclusion.\n\nThis, he told reporters, was an \u201cirrelevant distraction.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The cryptically worded request marked urgent from the State Department's independent watchdog set Congress on edge.The message, according to Steven A.
