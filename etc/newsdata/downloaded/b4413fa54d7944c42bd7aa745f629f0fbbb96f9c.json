REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\n\nBoth cases were part of European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager\u2019s crackdown on unlawful tax breaks offered by EU countries to multinationals, which has also extended to Apple\u2019s (AAPL.O) Irish deal and Amazon\u2019s (AMZN.O) Luxembourg deal, among others.\n\nThe judgments show that the General Court, Europe\u2019s second-highest court, in general endorses the European Commission\u2019s methodology in its tax crackdown but stipulates the Commission must do its homework properly to prove its case - potentially a bad omen for Apple fighting a record 13-billion-euro Irish tax order.\n\nIt is an important legal victory for the Commission, said Dimitrios Kyriazis, head of Law Faculty at New College of the Humanities London.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the outcome of individual cases, the General Court seems to have sanctioned the Commission\u2019s approach,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Starbucks\u2019 case, the EU competition enforcer failed to show that the U.S. coffee chain benefited unfairly from the Dutch tax deal, the court said.\n\n\u201cThe Commission was unable to demonstrate the existence of an advantage in favor of Starbucks,\u201d judges said.\n\nThe Dutch finance ministry said the judgment showed that the multinational was treated the same as other companies.\n\nStarbucks also welcomed the ruling, saying it had not received any special tax treatment from the Netherlands and that it \u201cpays all of its taxes wherever they are due\u201d.\n\nIn a separate ruling, the Court upheld the Commission\u2019s decision against Fiat\u2019s Luxembourg\u2019s tax deal, saying that the Commission had applied its state aid rules correctly to assess if there was an illegal advantage and was not seeking to harmonize tax rules across the bloc, an argument cited by critics.\n\nIt also agreed with the Commission\u2019s finding that the Luxembourg tax ruling was a selective one, meaning that such rulings were not available to all companies, a key argument used by companies ordered to pay back taxes.\n\nLuxembourg said it would analyze the judgment and reserved all its rights. Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe said it was disappointed with the judgment and was considering its next steps, adding that the matter was not material to the group.\n\nVestager said the court endorsed the Commission\u2019s approach in using state aid rules in tax cases, adding however that a more comprehensive strategy was needed to tackle tax avoidance.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal that all companies pay their fair share of tax can only be achieved by a combination of efforts to make legislative changes, enforce state aid rules and a change in corporate philosophies,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Commission in its 2015 decisions said Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler set prices for goods and services sold between subsidiaries, known as transfer prices, that were below market rates and which artificially lowered their taxes.\n\nThe losing side can appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union on points of law.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) sign is seen at its U.S. headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan, U.S. May 25, 2018.
