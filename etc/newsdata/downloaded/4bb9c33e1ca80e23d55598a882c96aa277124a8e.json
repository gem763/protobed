Firefighters raced to the scene and put out two fires in five minutes.\n\n\u201cBy the time they reached the site\u2026other strikes were also landing on the facilities,\u201d he said. The other two fires took five more hours to extinguish.\n\nBlazes at Abqaiq took seven hours to put out, said Khalid Buraik, a vice president.\n\nAramco, striking a defiant note, says it will bring back full crude output at both facilities by the end of the month.\n\nThe attack on Khurais damaged key piping infrastructure. Damaged segments displayed for cameras had holes ranging in size from a bullet to a fist.\n\nAbdulkarim said the fires had turned oil in the pipes into a black tarry coal which covered much of the nearby ground, but by Friday, only a small mound of debris remained as workers in jumpsuits hosed down the ground.\n\nThe drones that crashed into Abqaiq, a 70-year-old plant, bore meter-wide holes through the upper sections of large spherical containers and tall columns of piping.\n\nThousands of workers are toiling around the clock to repair the damage. In some structures, gaping holes are being patched over but others will need to be replaced completely, the company representatives said.\n\nThe full extent of the damage - and its cost both in property damage and lost business - may never be revealed.", "description": "When 18 drones slammed into the world's biggest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia last Saturday, the roughly hundred workers on weekend night shift leapt into action to confront the blazes that had erupted.", "authors": ["Stephen Kalin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
