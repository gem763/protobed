MEPs retaliated by vetoing Sylvie Goulard, the French president\u2019s pick to join the new EU executive in Brussels.\n\nThe EPP is now expected to heap pressure on Mr Macron to name Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, as his choice to become what has been dubbed a \u201csuper-commissioner\u201d in charge of industrial, space and defence policy.\n\nThe French president rejected EPP candidate Manfred Weber in marathon talks in July that destroyed the 2014 Spitzenkandidat precedent, a democratic experiment that tied the commission presidency to the results of the European elections. Prior to 2014, EU leaders in the European Council picked the commission president.\n\nMr Macron was pivotal in the backroom summit dealings that led to Ursula von der Leyen being parachuted into the job. The switch humiliated the fragmented parliament which backed the replacement candidate by just nine votes, despite vowing not to in a resolution.\n\nEvery EU country nominates a commissioner to serve in Brussels but they face a hearing and vote from MEPs on their candidacy. Britain has not nominated a candidate for the next commission, which takes office on November 1, because of Brexit.\n\nSenior sources in the EPP suggested Mr Barnier, a member of their party who has served two terms as an EU commissioner for France, would have been an easier pick to support than Ms Goulard.\n\nMr Macron has praised Mr Barnier, who has a EU-wide profile thanks to his influential Brexit role, but will be reluctant to name a commissioner who is not a member of his liberal Renew Europe group.\n\nSylvie Goulard, during her second hearing before the European Parliament in Brussels Credit: Olivier Hoslet/Rex More\n\nFormer MEP Ms Goulard faced questions over two hearings about her lucrative work for a US think tank and allegations she used her European Parliament assistant for domestic political work.\n\nAn EPP tweet accidentally revealed a faint WhatsApp message saying, \u201cGuys we are going to kill her in the vote later but do not say,\u201d before a committee of MEPs voted 82 against and 29 in favour of giving her the job.\n\nIt is traditional for MEPs to reject at least one candidate for commissioner as a \u201csacrificial lamb\u201d. Ms Goulard is the third rejected candidate for the new commission, which is a record number of scalps at the hearing stage. She thanked Mr Macron for his confidence in her.\n\nMEPs have already rejected Romania\u2019s and Hungary\u2019s candidate but the dismissal of a French commissioner is unprecedented. The last member of a Western European country to be rejected was in 2004.\n\nMr Macron said he had warned the new European Commission president that her choice of Ms Goulard could be controversial but that the heads of all the European parliamentary groups had assured beforehand they had no problem with her.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t understand how the president of the Commission can have a discussion with the three group presidents and they agree on something like that only for it to change. I need to understand what happened in terms of pettiness and resentment.\u201d", "description": "The European Parliament took revenge against Emmanuel Macron by rejecting his choice to be France\u2019s next EU Commissioner on Thursday.
