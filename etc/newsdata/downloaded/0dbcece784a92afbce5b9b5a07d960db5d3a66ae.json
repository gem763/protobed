Obviously, we weren\u2019t on our game.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis swept a four-game home series from Colorado two weeks ago, including a 6-0 win against Gonz\u00e1lez on Aug. 25.\n\n\u201cBetter command of his pitches,\u201d St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cHe was keeping the ball down, working the corners and he had all of his pitches he looked like he was throwing for strikes and quality strikes.\u201d\n\nGiven the early advantage, Gonz\u00e1lez (1-6) allowed one run and four hits in six innings. The 27-year-old right-hander had been 0-6 with a 7.29 in nine starts and one relief appearance this year, and he had not won in the big leagues since Sept. 22, 2015, for Texas at Oakland.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of emotion,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cI\u2019m just thankful to be out here, to be with this group of guys. It\u2019s a great clubhouse.\u201d\n\nJairo D\u00edaz got six outs and finished a six-hitter for second save.\n\nMichael Wacha (6-7) allowed five hits in four innings and is winless in seven starts and two relief appearances since July 19.\n\nCharlie Blackmon singled with one out in the first, and Arenado drove a changeup to left. Arenado\u2019s 38th home run this season gave him 110 RBIs this year and 500 extra-base hits in his career.\n\n\u201cThat was probably one of the few changeups that just didn\u2019t really do anything,\u201d Wacha said. \u201cIt just kind of stayed right there in the middle of the plate. And with him, he doesn\u2019t really ever miss those.\u201d\n\nDexter Fowler doubled leading off the fourth and scored on Paul Goldschmidt\u2019s groundout. Gonz\u00e1lez pitched out of a bases-loaded, one-out ham in the fifth when pinch-hitter Matt Carpenter hit a soft liner to shortstop Trevor Story and Fowler grounded out.\n\nSt. Louis had runners on the corners in the seventh before Carlos Est\u00e9vez relieved Bryan Shaw and struck out Harrison Bader and Jos\u00e9 Martinez.\n\nNOT MEASURING UP\n\nArenado\u2019s drive was tied the third-longest in the major leagues this season, according to Statcast, trailing home runs by Texas\u2019 Nomar Mazara (505) and Rockies teammate Ian Desmond (486). Arenado is dubious of Statcast\u2019s measurements, citing a home run by Houston rookie Yordan Alvarez on Monday that was calculated at 415 feet.\n\n\u201cHe hit it to the third deck in Houston. That ball might have gone a little farther than mine,\u201d Arenado said. As long as it\u2019s fair and goes out of the ballpark that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nStatcast calculates the distance a ball would travel if it had landed at ground level unobstructed.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nCardinals: C Matt Wieters (left calf strain) is getting closer to returning. He has been out since Sept. 1 and has increased his baseball activities in recent days.\n\nRockies: LHP Kyle Freeland (left groin strain) threw a bullpen session on Saturday and is scheduled to have another one Wednesday. Freeland has been out since Aug. 22. \u2026 Colorado is not sure whether OF David Dahl (right ankle sprain) will return this season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCardinals RHP Dakota Hudson (15-6, 3.40) will face Rockies RHP Antonio Senzatela (8-10, 7.19) in the second of the three-game series on Wednesday. Hudson is 11-2 in his last 14 starts while Senzatela has a 16.15 ERA in his last six outings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nolan Arenado sent a ball soaring out of Coors Field, and the St. Louis Cardinals could not recover.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Kelly"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/cardinals_rockies_baseball_58405_c0-323-4469-2928_s1770x1032.jpg?1d4c5e85122e8dcc8ca3d92325c0ad0229501f76", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
