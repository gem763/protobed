Prosecutors said Arias killed Alexander in a jealous rage after learning he was planning a trip to Mexico with another woman.\n\nArias has acknowledged killing Alexander but claimed she acted in self-defense after he attacked her. He was stabbed nearly 30 times, had his throat slit and was shot in the head.\n\nArias was convicted of murder in 2013 but jurors were deadlocked on punishment. A second sentencing trial ended in early 2015 with another jury deadlock, leading a judge to sentence Arias to life behind bars.\n\nFORMER GEORGIA POLICE OFFICER FOUND NOT GUILTY OF KILLING UNARMED NAKED MAN, CONVICTED OF OTHER CHARGES\n\nViolent details about Arias and Alexander were broadcast live around the world. And Arias has courted the spotlight since her 2008 arrest, having done multiple media interviews before and after her conviction.\n\nEngle said Martinez capitalized on publicity and went so far as to sign autographs and take pictures with fans outside the courthouse. She denied that her client had similarly courted publicity.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe judges didn't say when they would issue a ruling.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "An Arizona appellate court was deciding Thursday whether to reverse the murder conviction of Jodi Arias after her attorneys argued that a prosecutor had mishandled her case by whipping up publicity.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
