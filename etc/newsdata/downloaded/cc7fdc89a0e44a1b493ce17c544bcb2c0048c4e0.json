Kavanaugh begin suing for libel after issues with the FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations against him resurfaced.\n\nMr. Trump accused Democrats and the media of trying to bully the justice into \u201cturning liberal.\u201d\n\nBrett Kavanaugh should start suing people for liable, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nThe president\u2019s comments came after the New York Times released an article on Saturday about Deborah Ramirez, who accused Justice Kavanaugh of thrusting a penis in her face at a party during their time at Yale.\n\nThe article found that none of the 25 witnesses Ms. Ramirez\u2019 legal team named for the FBI were interviewed. Also, one of her lawyers claimed the agents they spoke to told them they were limited by the Republican held Senate Judiciary committee on what they could investigate.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s report on the claims from Ms. Ramirez and fellow accuser Christine Blasey Ford was released in early October, but failed to provide much clarity on the alleged events. The investigators talked to 10 people, including three unnamed individuals related to Ms. Ramirez\u2019 allegations.\n\nThe New York Times article also revealed a new allegation from Max Stier, a classmate at Yale, who claimed he saw Justice Kavanaugh with his pants down at a party and friends pressed his genitals into a girl\u2019s hand. Though he reached out to the FBI, his claim wasn\u2019t investigated, The Times reported.\n\nPresidential candidate Julian Castro called for this latest claim to be investigated and called for the justice to be impeached.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAnd Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.\u201d\n\nClaims of sexual assault from Ms. Blasey Ford \u2014 which ultimately triggered an emotionally-charged Senate hearing \u2014 and Ms. Ramirez threaten to derail Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings last September.\n\nHe has strongly denied both claims.\n\nOctober 6 will mark Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s first year on the Supreme Court.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
