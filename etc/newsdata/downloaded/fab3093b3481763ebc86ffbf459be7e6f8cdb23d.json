But the redacted letter did not identify by name whose records it has.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe order from the court Thursday specifies that the bank does not have the president\u2019s returns, but says, rather, that it has returns for two other individuals.\n\nDeutsche Bank \u201creports that the only tax returns it has for individuals or entities named in the subpoenas are not those of the President,\u201d according to the opinion from Judge Jon O. Newman, who was joined by Judges Peter W. Hall and Debra Ann Livingston.\n\n\u201cThe identity of the two taxpayers whose tax returns Deutsche Bank has, is not relevant to any issue we need to decide,\u201d the court added.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Deutsche Bank has their tax returns adds nothing to the arguments of the parties in the pending appeal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCapital One had previously told the court it had no tax returns responsive to the congressional subpoenas.\n\nA spokeswoman for House Democrats did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the disclosure.\n\nAD\n\nUnlike past presidents, Trump has refused to release his tax returns and has sued to try to stop the banks and his accounting firm from complying with congressional subpoenas.\n\nTrump is appealing in a separate case in New York, where a judge this week rejected the president\u2019s effort to block the Manhattan district attorney from accessing Trump\u2019s tax returns as part of an investigation into hush-money payments during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAD", "description": "The disclosure came in a court order in Trump\u2019s lawsuit seeking to block congressional subpoena.", "authors": ["Ann E.
