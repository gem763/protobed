Heck, outside of big national events, I\u2019m going to bet you have never willingly watched C-Span.\n\nBut less than one year since she entered Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has represented New York\u2019s 14th congressional district since January, has changed that.\n\nOcasio-Cortez stumps Zuckerberg with questions on far right and Cambridge Analytica Read more\n\nAOC has shown a remarkable ability to extract energizing viral moments from stale bureaucratic meetings. She turns complex political concepts into snappy soundbites and boring old politics into much-talked-about spectacle.\n\nThe is exactly what happened on Wednesday during her questioning of Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg about his early awareness of the disgraced political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which harvested millions of Facebook users\u2019 personal information to influence the 2016 US election. The confrontation is uncomfortable to watch, with Ocasio-Cortez grilling Zuckerberg on key details about his knowledge back then \u2013 he denies having any \u2013 and then ending on the zinger:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know? This was the largest data scandal with respect to your company, that had catastrophic impacts on the 2016 election. You don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\nShe is met with a squirming Zuckerberg and therein, a viral moment is made.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t her first time capturing people\u2019s attention with her line of questioning. In fact, it wasn\u2019t even her first time that day.\n\n1. ExxonMobil\n\nPlay Video 1:24 'So they knew': Ocasio-Cortez questions Exxon scientist on climate crisis denial \u2013 video\n\nJust hours before she made Zuckerberg eat his own words, AOC attended a hearing with the oil giant ExxonMobil.\n\nIn the video, she shows Martin Hoffert, a consultant for the company, a graph he worked on from 1982 and asks him to describe it. Thus she gets him to explain how the company knew about climate change before she was even born \u2013 predicting its levels accurately until the present day.\n\nThe stinger comes at the end, when Hoffert testifies: \u201cWe were excellent scientists,\u201d and she adds: \u201cYes. You were: so they knew. \u201d\n\n2. White terrorism\n\nDuring this hearing, Ocasio-Cortez exposes an American double standard: that white supremacist acts of violence are treated as hate crimes, while similar violence committed by Muslims is treated as terrorism.\n\nHer cunning ability to use the FBI\u2019s own rhetoric against it is what makes it so watchable. She gets the bureau\u2019s assistant director for counter-terrorism to describe terrorism in his own terms, and then repeatedly uses his own definitions as a stick to beat him with.\n\n3. Corporate Pac money\n\nOcasio-Cortez achieves the seemingly impossible: turning a discussion about the intricacies of campaign finance into a clear and immensely watchable three-minute video. The clip, which was uploaded by the leftwing channel NowThis news, has been viewed more than 37m times, making it the most watched political video ever posted to Twitter.\n\nShe starts out with the proposition \u201clet\u2019s play a game\u201d \u2013 and off she goes.\n\nIn this game, she is the self-interested bad guy, trying to make as much money as possible. She checks in every now and then with the panel of government watchdogs, to see how much she can get away with. The answer? Pretty much everything \u2013 playing into her point that of course the system is broken.\n\n3. Green New Deal\n\nAfter Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal failed to pass the Senate, she gave the GOP a supreme telling off by tearing down the presumption that only elites care about the environment. In the clip, she asks:\n\n\u201cYou want to tell people that their desire for clean air and water is elitist? \u2026 I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nIf she has already proven that she can act as a great game-show host and detective \u2013 here is proof that she excels in giving a lecture, too:", "description": "The Democrat made waves by challenging Zuckerberg.
