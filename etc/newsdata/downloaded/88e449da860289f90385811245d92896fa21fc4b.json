If he holds his position maybe he can clear it. Ash [Young] never really gets goal-side.\n\n'But if you watch Rojo he just anticipates where the ball is going to be instead of staying with his man.\n\nThe Argentine international had originally been named among Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's substitutes for the clash, but was drafted into the starting line-up after youngster Axel Tuanzebe suffered a hip problem in the warm up.\n\nAs part of a five-man defence, Rojo played a crucial role in frustrating the reigning European champions - but United were pegged back late on when ex-Southampton star Lallana tapped home at the far post.\n\nUnited legend Giggs criticised the 29-year-old's positioning for Adam Lallana's late leveller\n\nRojo was originally named as a substitute on Sunday before being drafted into the starting XI\n\nGiggs later admitted that Liverpool had threatened to net a leveller in the latter stages of the game.\n\nHe added: 'I think it's a poor goal to give away. But Liverpool, for that five and ten minutes, were knocking at the door and there you see Robertson crossing the ball a lot further up the pitch.\n\n'Where for the majority of the game, him and Trent Alexander-Arnold were crossing the ball from 40, 45 yards out.'\n\nMarcus Rashford opened the scoring at Old Trafford in controversial circumstances, when the hosts countered after an apparent foul on Divock Origi to round off a lightning counter by taking the lead.", "description": "United legend Giggs rued Rojo's lapse defending in the build-up to the goal, and criticised the 29-year-old's questionable positioning inside the penalty area.", "authors": ["Daniel Davis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/11/19986380-0-image-a-22_1571653827896.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
