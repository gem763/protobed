The Pumas\u2019 form hardly suggests it is a surprise, either, having now lost 29 of their last 34 games.\n\nFrustrated coach Mario Ledesma is using his last Pool C fixture to give more of his squad the opportunity for a taste of the World Cup action, making nine changes to the team that started against England.\n\nOnly Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro, Santiago Carreras, Jeronimo de la Fuente, Guido Petti, Pablo Matera and Julian Montoya remain. Nicolas Sanchez, controversially left out of the 23 against England, is back to start at flyhalf, partnering scrumhalf Felipe Ezcurra, who will be making his second start in his seventh appearance.\n\nLock Tomas Lavanini, who was sent off after 17 minutes against England, is unavailable as he serves the first of a four-match ban for his high hit on Owen Farrell.\n\nThe Pumas will have to try to rouse themselves to avoid what would be a humiliating finale to a desperately disappointing campaign. They have beaten the United States in all five previous fixtures, though the last of them was 18 years ago.\n\nThe Americans showed areas of improvement against England and France and will see this as a great opportunity to secure what would be only their fourth win in 26 World Cup games \u2013 with the chance of a famous second in their final game to come against Tonga.\n\n\u201cWith Argentina\u2019s short turnaround, then losing to England and not qualifying and the disappointment they\u2019re facing, they might not show up as well as they would have if they were qualifying,\u201d said flyhalf AJ MacGinty.\n\n\u201cAny time we play competitive games against the tier-one nations, I feel like we get better week to week. Having the games against England and France, the pressure is on us to deliver another performance that\u2019s even better than the France game. Our focus is on that. If we can do that as a squad and as individuals, then that puts us in a good place for beating Argentina.\u201d", "description": "Playing a dead rubber is unfamiliar territory for Argentina, who reached the semi-finals of two of the last three World Cups, and having to drag themselves off the floor to face a fired-up United States team on Wednesday will be a test of resilience.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437991162&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960EB", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
