The work was restored by the US-registered Advancing Women Artists (AWA) Foundation, which has restored 65 works by historic female artists in Florence since 2009\n\n$187,000 was raised for the restoration of the painting- with donors 'adopting' an apostle for $10,000 each\n\nAfter entering the covent of Santa Caterina in Cafaggio age 14 sister Nelli started her own company of painting nuns who could be commissioned by the church and private clients to create large biblical scenes on canvas.\n\nIt is believed she painted 'The Last Supper' in the 1560s in her late 30s.\n\nA crowdfunding mission by AWA in 2017 \u00a3144,500 ($187,000) was raised for the restoration of the painting- with donors 'adopting' an apostle for \u00a37,700 ($10,000) each.\n\nAlthough disloyal apostle Judas was not willingly 'adopted' by a singular donor, a charitable 10 donors came together to raise the remaining \u00a37,700 ($10,000).\n\nConservator Rossella Lari makes the finishing touches on The Last Supper by Plautilla Nelli\n\nThe restored Last Supper by Plautilla Nelli is put on public display in the Museo di Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy\n\nThe Last Supper by Plautilla Nelli, restoration after transfer to the Santa Maria Novella Museum, post-restoration\n\nAWA's director, Linda Falcone told The Art Newspaper: 'Within these seven metres you can see different painterly hands, so it's canvas proof that she founded this all-women workshop inside her convent.'\n\n'Orate pro pictora', pray for the paintress, is touchingly written beneath sister Nelli's signature.\n\nConservator Rossella Lari wrote in a catalogue for the exhibit that the piece had a 'great sense of energy and determination' and noted inconsistencies that she put down to sister Nelli's lack of formal art education.\n\nIt is unlikely sister Nelli would have been allowed to study live models as a woman and a nun - she is thought to have used manuals and other paintings to have learned the anatomy of the male apostles that she painted in detail.\n\nA detail of the table of the The Last Supper by Plautilla Nelli, during cleaning before restoration\n\nOne of Nelli's most successful Saints in The Last Supper by Plautilla Nelli after restoration (left).
