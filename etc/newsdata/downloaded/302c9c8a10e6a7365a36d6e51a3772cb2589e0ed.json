I think even Sam Whitelock struck out a pukana (facial expression).\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks are globally famous for doing the haka before international rugby tests, although Perenara says they don\u2019t practice \u201cKapa o Pango\u201d and the much older and more frequently used \u201cKa Mate\u201d much.\n\n\u201cIf we need any top-ups or extra work, we\u2019ll find a slot throughout the week,\u201d Perenara says. \u201cOften, newer players in the environment need work on it, I\u2019ll do some one-on-one time with him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be in that conversation when people think of the All Blacks haka and put my name next to it. You don\u2019t hold that (haka leader) role forever, so while I have the honor I\u2019ll do it to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nRead says the enhanced version they showed against South Africa 10 days ago in Yokohama might have been a little too good.\n\n\u201cWe were a bit overeager once we started the game from it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ll work on through the tournament.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "If the All Blacks' pre-match haka against South Africa to open their Rugby World Cup defense appeared to have extra bite, it was deliberate.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/the_week_that_was_in_asia_photo_gallery_10818_c0-143-2762-1753_s1770x1032.jpg?c0a3374ff63ca19ca70569a23d7b9232b0c2f844", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
