We are no further forward than where we were this time last week.\n\n\"Part of me is feeling like it was just a publicity stunt on the UK Government side to show they are trying to help.\n\n\"But, although he is engaging with us, we have no answers. We are really frustrated that we could spend half an hour or more with him and just come out with nothing.\"\n\nImage caption Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles have spoken to US media about their case\n\nTogether with her husband Tim Dunn, she met Mr Raab in the hope he would urge the US to waive Ms Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity.\n\nMr Dunn said: \"I felt extremely let down by the Government today, or by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\n\"I'm deeply, deeply disappointed that they think it's okay to kill a young lad on his bike and they can just walk away.\"\n\n\"I don't think the Government or the Commonwealth Office have any clout to do anything.\"\n\nMs Charles urged Ms Sacoolas to do the \"humane thing to do and get on a plane and come back\".\n\nTheir lawyer Radd Seiger said they were in talks to launch a civil case against Ms Sacoolas and they were \"going to Washington soon to help us get that justice for Harry\".\n\nHe also invited US President Donald Trump to meet the family about the case.\n\n\"If meeting with President Trump would help us get a step closer to seek justice for Harry, to get justice for that boy who died that night needlessly, one of the most wonderful kids in our community, if that's what it takes then I will extend an invitation now to President Trump.\n\n\"Meet us. Let's have a chat. Nobody wants to litigate.\"\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has urged the US to reconsider its decision to allow Ms Sacoolas immunity, while Mr Raab had already spoken to the US ambassador and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nNorthamptonshire's chief constable and its police and crime commissioner have also urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity.\n\nHarry Dunn died after his Kawasaki motorcycle was in a crash with a black Volvo XC90 in Croughton, close to an RAF base.\n\nHe was taken to Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford where he died.\n\nChief Constable Nick Adderley said \"based on CCTV evidence\", officers knew that \"a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton\" and was \"on the wrong side of the road\".\n\nHe said the suspect, Ms Sacoolas, had \"engaged fully\" following the crash and said \"she had no plans to leave the country in the near future\".\n\nHowever, she then left for the United States and has not returned.", "description": "Harry Dunn's parents say their meeting with the foreign secretary felt like a \"publicity stunt\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/639F/production/_109130552_c4c0ad70-e432-4c8d-988e-94d1b9c92ba1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
