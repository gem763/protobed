Here's How That Turned Out.", "language": "en", "text": "Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nSeveral women confronted disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he showed up to a New York City event for emerging talent Wednesday night. But many of them were booed and heckled, and one was ultimately removed from the venue.\n\nWeinstein, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 80 women, rolled up to Actors Hour, a monthly event for young artists, at the Downtime bar in Manhattan. He sat down at a booth with younger women and older men in suits, people who were there told BuzzFeed News. At first, no one said anything about Weinstein\u2019s presence at the event. But when comedian Kelly Bachman took the stage, she called out \"a Freddy Krueger in the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I needed to bring my own mace and rape whistle to Actors Hour,\u201d she said. Members of the audience began booing, and a few yelled \u201cshut up,\u201d at her, a video of her performance shows. \u201cOh, 'shut up'? This kills at group therapy for rape survivors.\u201d\n\nDuring intermission, comedian Amber Rollo and actor Zoe Struckless also confronted Weinstein when they approached his table and began shouting at him, according to the Guardian.\n\nSomeone in the audience captured Struckless\u2019 confrontation with Weinstein on video.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s going to say anything? Nobody\u2019s really going to say anything?\u201d Struckless screamed while standing near Weinstein\u2019s table. \u201cI\u2019ll get out of here, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m going to stand four feet from a fucking rapist, and nobody\u2019s going to say anything.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent Facebook post, Struckless said Weinstein\u2019s bodyguards \u201cherded me out\u201d of the bar, though the video doesn\u2019t show that happening.\n\n\"So many women have suffered so greatly because of their experiences with this man, and there were no repercussions,\" Struckless told BuzzFeed News. \"And, in fact, he was being supported \u2014 and the community meant to uplift emerging actors and emerging artists was not only complicit but directly responsible for their silencing.\"\n\nIn a statement to BuzzFeed News, one of Weinstein\u2019s representatives said he still has rights. \u201cI would just point out that accusations are not convictions, and due process is still the foundation of each and every one of our civil rights in this country,\u201d the representative, Juda Engelmayer, said.\n\nWeinstein has apparently showed up to Actor\u2019s Hour before. \u201cI welcome all walks of life into my space,\u201d Alexandra Laliberte, the event\u2019s organizer, told BuzzFeed News, though she denied she invited him personally. \u201cComedians made fun of him. This one lady stood up and screamed at him. People walked out, which was fantastic.\u201d\n\nLaliberte doesn\u2019t seem to have addressed the fact that the people who confronted Weinstein were booed, heckled, and kicked out of the event, but in a post on the Actors Hour Facebook page, the organizers apologized for how they handled the situation.\n\nCover image: Actress Rose McGowan has filed suit against former film producer Harvey Weinstein and his former attorneys for allegedly attempting to discredit her rape claim against him. - May 30th 2018 (zz/Dennis Van Tine/STAR MAX/IPx)", "description": "\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I needed to bring my own mace and rape whistle to Actors Hour,\u201d a female comedian said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db304cdbd02cf008c538693/lede/1572013721386-AP_19298126199457.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8403xh;0xw,0.0313xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
