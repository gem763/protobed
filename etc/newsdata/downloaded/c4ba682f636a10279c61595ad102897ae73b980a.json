They also appeared to have no chin.\n\nThe experts predict many Denisovan traits that are similar to that of Neanderthals including a sloping forehead, long face and large pelvis, and others that are unique among humans, like a large dental arch.\n\nProf Carmel told the BBC he was delighted to find that some of their predictions had been confirmed by the discovery of a Denisovan jawbone by separate researchers.\n\n\"The jawbone was reported and we were very excited to see how it matched. It was kind of an independent confirmation of our method,\" he said.\n\nThe reconstructions were just the start in Denisovan research, Prof Carmel said.\n\n\"They were humans very similar to us so pointing out the differences between us is critical to understand what makes us human and what might have led to the way we adapted to the world,\" he said.", "description": "The reconstructions offer the first glimpse of what the Denisovan looked like.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2D25/production/_108875511_ac4adf0f-24ae-4f86-9705-5b95401238f4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
