I would like to feel safe again.\"\n\nTarazaga-Orero has not worked since arriving in the UK except helping at the hostel where he stays in central London.\n\nHe was sentenced to a 12-month community order requiring 30 days of rehabilitation activity, and ordered to pay \u00a3335 in total including \u00a3250 costs.\n\nAt his trial, Tarazaga-Orero had denied one count of stalking between April and June this year, claiming Harry had offered him money to \"have some fun\" in a hotel, which the singer denied.\n\nBut the Spanish national was found guilty at Hendon Magistrates' Court.\n\nHarry had taken pity on the homeless man after seeing him sleeping rough at the bus station by his London home.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe offered to buy Tarazaga-Orero food or a hotel room, but the man told him he only ate vegan food and asked for edamame beans.\n\nDistrict Judge Nigel Deane heard how the next day, Harry bought the man two sandwiches, two salads and two muffins from a vegan cafe, but decided to stop interacting with Tarazaga-Orero following an \"odd\" incident.\n\n\"He asked me if I wanted to go to a restaurant to eat,\" Harry recalled at the trial.\n\n\"I told him I was on my way to work. I found it a little odd. His facial expression made me feel a little uneasy. It was like a smirk.\n\n(Image: Paul Davey/SWNS)\n\n\"Until that point, I never felt unsafe or uneasy in my own home.\"\n\nTwo months later, Harry said his stalker had \"lunged\" at him and \"blocked his path\" as he went running.\n\nTarazaga-Orero demanded money and continued staring after Harry as he ran off.\n\n\"I never really encountered this kind of behaviour before,\" he went on.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"I've employed a night guard. I continue to lock my bedroom door at night.\"\n\nHe also said he continues to check for \"weak spots\" in his home.", "description": "Pablo Tarazaga-Orero stalked Harry Styles by posting money and notes through his letterbox, prompting the singer to install a lock on his bedroom door", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Paul Davey Swns", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20664438.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_PABLO_TARAZAGA-ORERO_005.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
