Her father Lazlo set up the company 35 years ago.\n\nToday, it employs 82 people, that\u2019s twice as many as in 2005. Turnover has grown eight-fold reaching 5.2 millions euros.\n\nFor a decade now, Adrienn has also been teaching management techniques. It was a natural step for her to become part of the European Network of Mentors for Women Entrepreneurs which operates in 17 countries.\n\nAdrienn is one of 12 tutors in Hungary, where she is mentor to two entrepreneurs, whom she has helped with fund-raising and networking.\n\n\u201cThis is my main motivation,\u201d she says. \u201cTo share my experience in a national and multinational environment, especially in large and medium-sized businesses, to help my mentees succeed in their own business.\u201d\n\nAdrienn talks to them at least once a week, and meets up with them once a month. Today, it\u2019s Bernadett\u2019s turn to visit her. A year ago, Bernadett set up her own IT firm.\n\nLike many young entrepreneurs, Bernadett had trouble making sense of the complex accounts system. That is where Adrienn\u2019s experience came in handy.\n\n\u201cNow I know exactly what I\u2019m supposed to expect from my accountant,\u201d says Bernadett, \u201cwhat I need to look out for, and how I need to plan things ahead to get the results I need.\u201d\n\nAdrienn says she too has a lot to gain from the exchange. Her contribution, which is entirely voluntary, helps her develop her own network: \u201cThrough this mentor programme, we meet new entrepreneurs. And I think that developing such a network is really important.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that the keys to success are the same for men as for women. Discipline, a positive approach, the ability to work in a team, and of course, continuous innovation,\u201d she concluded.", "description": "This week, Business Planet takes a look at one of Europe\u2019s answers to the economic crisis: a network of tutors encouraging women entrepreneurs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/199076/1000x563_199076.jpg", "published_at": "2012-09-21"}
