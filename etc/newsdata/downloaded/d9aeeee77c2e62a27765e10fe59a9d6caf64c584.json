She will meet Trump in New York on Monday.\n\nThe two leaders have wildly divergent styles, to the extent that Vogue magazine dubbed Ardern \u201cthe anti-Trump\u201d; citing her progressive values and work on women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights. The two also have a chequered history.\n\nIn November 2017, one month after Ardern took office, Trump allegedly mistook her for Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s wife at the east Asia summit in Vietnam.\n\nArdern later apologised for indiscreetly discussing the incident with a friend. The friend \u2013 comedian Tom Sainsbury \u2013 revealed in a radio interview that Ardern had told her Trump was \u201cnot as orange in real life\u201d.\n\nArdern said she did not want to turn the issue into a \u201cdiplomatic incident\u201d.\n\nAt the same conference Ardern also pointedly told Trump \u2013 \u201cno one marched when I was elected\u201d \u2013 a comment she later claimed was made in jest.\n\nJacinda Ardern retorts to Donald Trump: 'No one marched when I was elected' Read more\n\nOn 21 January 2017, the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Ardern joined thousands in Auckland as part of the global women\u2019s march, which arose in reaction to a series of allegations from women about sexual advances from the US president, as well as his plans to cut access to abortion across the US and in developing countries supported by US aid.\n\nArdern said the relationship between the US and New Zealand was robust and that she would focus on economic issues during her meeting. \u201cOur relationship is strong. I\u2019ve met President Trump on a number of occasions and had several phone calls with him ... I think my relationship [with Trump] is absolutely fine,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe US is a key security partner for New Zealand, and an important trading partner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to discussing a wide range of international and regional issues with President Trump, including our cooperation in the Pacific and the trade relationship between our countries.\u201d\n\nBefore reaching the UN summit, Ardern will take part in an official summit with Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Tokyo and watch the All Blacks begin their Rugby World Cup defence in Yokohama.\n\nDeputy prime minister and NZ First leader Winston Peters will be acting prime minister for the duration of the trip.\n\nAfter becoming PM, Ardern praised Trump as \u201cconsistent\u201d. \u201cHe is the same person that you see behind the scenes as he is in the public or through the media,\u201d she told the New Zealand Herald.", "description": "New Zealand prime minister says relationship with US counterpart is strong despite previous run-ins", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c192b4053f0eac96e5f364f6b4ef81801f46caf7/342_295_4538_2723/master/4538.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=27f4e193ea306d39231049b3c3f744ab", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
