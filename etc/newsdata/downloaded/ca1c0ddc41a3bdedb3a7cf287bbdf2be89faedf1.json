Mayor Bowser (D), flanked by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), far right, and 51 veterans, call for D.C. statehood. They paraded down Pennsylvania Avenue NW under a canopy of 140 U.S. flags that each carried an extra star, for the 51st state. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday pressed her campaign for District statehood, leading a caravan toward the U.S. Capitol, past 140 newly hung American flags with an extra 51st star to symbolize the city\u2019s quest for congressional voting rights.\n\nWith a House hearing on D.C. statehood scheduled for Thursday, the first in 25 years, Bowser (D) hired two double-decker buses to travel a largely barren parade route down Pennsylvania Avenue NW. At the end of the procession, she addressed a rally that included District government employees who were prodded to attend by mayoral aides.\n\nAt 3rd Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, where the parade concluded, the mayor pumped her fist as Bernie Siler, 67, a retired Army reservist, climbed a ladder and placed on a lamppost one of the 51 star flags purchased with taxpayer funds.\n\n\u201cThe time for statehood for Washington D.C. is now,\u201d Bowser told a boisterous crowd, many of whom held miniature District flags and included 51 District residents who are military veterans. \u201cThe 51st state will happen and our state will be represented on our flag.\u201d\n\nYet the significance of the flag with the extra star appeared to elude pedestrians along the parade route. \u201cI can\u2019t see the 51st star at all,\u201d Alex Ortiz, a salesperson who lives in Arlington, said as he sat on a bench near 11th Street.\n\nRobert Ellis, a priest visiting from London, said the Bowser-hung flag looked like a regular \u201cflag of the United States of America.\u201d \u201cIs it different?\u201d he asked. \u201cI would think it\u2019s illegal to change it, especially near the White House.\u201d\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 One of 140 American flags with an extra star purchased by the D.C. government and installed along Pennsylvania Avenue NW. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nThe installation of the flags prompted a flurry of discussion on Twitter, including questions about the propriety of the added star and criticism of the cost. \u201cI\u2019m all about #DCStatehood but feel like making a new flag before it\u2019s official is a waste of taxpayer money,\u201d one tweeter wrote.\n\nA few hours after the rally, the mayor\u2019s official Twitter account released a 26 second video of the event that included Bowser telling the crowd, \u201cI was born without representation but I will not die without representation.\u201d\n\nLaToya Foster, a spokesperson for the mayor, said the cost of the event, including the flags, was $31,206. The funds came out of the $1 million the D.C. Council set aside for the statehood campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we can cover it,\u201d Foster said, adding that the 51 star flag is legitimate as a representation of \u201cwhat we have been fighting for.\u201d\n\nBowser\u2019s statehood campaign is the latest variation on a quest that has eluded her predecessors even when Democrats \u2014 more sympathetic towards the District\u2019s left-leaning electorate \u2014 controlled the White House during the Obama administration and both chambers of Congress.\n\nAt the moment, Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District\u2019s nonvoting congressional representative, has more than 200 co-sponsors for a House bill to grant the city statehood. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-MD) have voiced support for the legislation.\n\nBut the bill\u2019s chances of becoming law appear less than slim as long as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) and Republicans are in control. McConnell has vowed to hold up a companion bill proposed by Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del), which has more than 30 sponsors.\n\nAsked about Republican opposition, Norton told the rally, \u201cDon\u2019t even worry about McConnell. He won\u2019t be there much longer.\u201d\n\nNorton and Bowser rode on the top deck of a double-decker bus, the side of which featured the mayor\u2019s name in large white lettering and a message conveying the rally\u2019s thrust: that the District is home to 702,000 residents, including 30,000 military veterans, all of whom have \u201czero votes\u201d in Congress.\n\nBefore boarding the bus, a gaggle of public officials, including Council members Trayon White (D-Ward 8) and Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1), formed a gauntlet on the steps of city hall through which the mayor passed as if she were on her way to compete in a sporting event.\n\n\u201cAlright! Alright!\u201d Bowser said as she exchanged high-fives and walked to the bus, which was preceded by another double decker packed with TV news cameras recording their trip. At 7th Street NW, a man waved. Another pumped his fist. Police officers blocked traffic on the side-streets as the buses went by.\n\n\u201cStatehood Now!\u201d the mayor and her entourage chanted, largely to silence.\n\nA crowd heavy with D.C. government workers waited at 3rd Street NW. Among the department heads was Tommy Wells, the District\u2019s director of the Dept. of Energy and the Environment.\n\nSiler introduced the mayor as \u201cpotentially the next governor\u201d of the District if the city becomes a state, and the crowd cheered.\n\nOn Sunday, Steve Walker, director of Bowser\u2019s office of Talent and Appointments, which oversees hiring for high-level city jobs, sent a mass email requesting that administration officials attend the rally, arriving early to \u201cmeet your block captains for further instructions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope you are able to attend this historic event,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cPlease share with colleagues and bring family and friends.\u201d\n\nFoster said the email is typical of messages that Bowser aides send out \u201cfor all public events we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is part of our work,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is District government work.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Mayor installs 51 star flags along Pennsylvania Avenue to symbolize DC\u2019s quest", "authors": ["Paul Schwartzman", "Reporter Specializing In Political Profiles", "Narratives About Life", "Death", "Everything In Between", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GYmJ004sRpJZuISfjpVVv2f_vsM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RDL2QWWYWAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
