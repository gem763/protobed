China's Commerce Ministry on Tuesday said Vice Premier Liu He, the country's chief trade negotiator, will travel to Washington for the next round of trade discussions on Thursday and Friday.\n\nYi Gang, the governor of China's central bank, and Ning Jizhe, the deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, will also attend the talks.\n\nThe White House also mentioned in a release Monday that its lead negotiators \u2014 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer \u2014 will welcome Liu and his delegation. The two sides will discuss forced technology transfer, intellectual property rights and agriculture, among other issues.\n\nA decision by the United States to put 28 Chinese entities on a blacklist may cast a shadow over the talks, though.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce on Monday attributed that decision to what it called \"human rights violations and abuses\" of Uyghurs and other predominately Muslim ethnic minorities in China's far western region of Xinjiang.\n\nA 2018 report from the US State Department estimated that China had \"arbitrarily detained 800,000 to possibly more than two million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other Muslims in internment camps designed to erase religious and ethnic identities.\"\n\nSurveillance company Hikvision and its rival, Dahua Technology, were on the list. They both said Tuesday that they would suspend trading of their shares pending announcements, but did not specifically mention the blacklist.
