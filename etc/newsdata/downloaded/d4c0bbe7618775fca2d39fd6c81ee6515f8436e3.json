We will not be giving any more. Difficult times ahead\u201d.\n\nThe EU\u2019s starting point for a deal was thought to have been a rejection of Mr Johnson\u2019s \u201ctwo borders\u201d plan for Northern Ireland, and a demand the UK switched to a Northern Ireland only backstop instead.\n\nBrussels sources indicated that a draft treaty could be published in London as early as this morning after the UK agreed in principle to there being a customs border in the Irish Sea.\n\nAfter talks at No 10 last night, senior Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker said he believed a \u201ctolerable\u201d deal he could vote for was in sight.\n\nHis hard Brexiteer ERG group of Tory MPs, however, will not pass final judgement until they have seen the legal text of any deal.\n\nMr Johnson was also reaching out to Labour MPs with Leave seats, whose votes he will need to get any new agreement through Parliament.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nNo 10 hopes that as many as 30 Labour MPs could help deliver his Brexit plan - but the Mirror understands the number is likely to be substantially lower - with party insiders suggesting fewer then 10.\n\nThe Mirror was told the Labour MPs set out their \u2018shopping list\u2019 of demands including guarantees on workers\u2019 and consumer rights and a demand for Parliament to have a say on key milestones on the future relationship.\n\nBut after the talks the MPs ruled out lending their support if the PM pursued a \u2018Singapore-on-Thames\u2019 style post-Brexit Britain as the hard Brexiteers demand.\n\nOne Labour MP told the Mirror: \u201cThey said they\u2019ll try their best to give us as much as possible. Lame, lame, lame\u201d.\n\nIrish PM Leo Varadkar said that Mr Johnson had told him last week that he was confident he could get a Brexit deal through Parliament.\n\nCommons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg added yesterday: \u201cI think the votes are now there for a deal. There is just a mood in the country and politicians have to be to some extent sensitive to the national mood that we want to get on with this.\u201d\n\nBut Brussels\u2019 chief negotiator Michel Barnier told EU ambassadors yesterday that the PM\u2019s Brexit proposals were not yet good enough.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe top EU official warned that he needed the legal text of the PM\u2019s final proposals by midnight if EU leaders were to approve it at the showdown summit on Thursday.\n\nA senior Brussels insider told the Mirror: \u201cIt depends on the PM in the end if he wants to conclude now.\u201d\n\nDiplomatic sources poured cold water on No 10\u2019s hopes of being able to finally strike a deal at the summit - saying it was not the right forum for 11th hour discussions.\n\nThey suggested more talks with the UK would be needed next week instead with an emergency summit pencilled in for October 28th.\n\nHowever, earlier Mr Barnier claimed that it might still possible to reach a deal in time - meaning Mr Johnson could have time to try to get a deal past MPs before October 31.\n\nHe said: \u201cEven if an agreement will be difficult, more and more difficult to be frank, it is still possible this week... It it is high time to turn good intentions into a legal text.\u201d\n\nMr Varadkar said the \u201cinitial indications\u201d from talks were that the two sides were making progress and \u201cmoving in the right direction\u201d.\n\nBut he added that it was \u201cas of now unclear\u201d whether a revised divorce deal would be ready in time for the summit.\n\nFrench and German government officials said reaching a deal this week was an ambitious target.\n\nThey believe that agreeing on technical issues could require another two months of talks - unless the UK makes more concessions.\n\nUnder the deal being negotiated, Northern Ireland would not be part of the EU\u2019s customs territory, but the bloc\u2019s full customs code would have to be enforced in the Irish Sea.\n\nEU sources said that customs and a commitment to abide by certain rules to keep a level playing-field remained key sticking points.\n\nHopes of a breakthrough mounted as the PM delayed yesterday\u2019s Cabinet meeting until this afternoon.\n\nThe fresh wave of Brexit optimism pushed the value of the pound higher and boosted shares in UK-focused firms.\n\nMr Johnson still hopes to put a deal before MPs this Saturday - the first weekend sitting of Parliament since the Falklands.\n\nIf he fails to get one then under the Benn Act he has to ask for another Brexit delay - which he could challenge in the courts.\n\nBut many expect the PM to reluctantly agree to an extension meaning he would break his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to leave the EU on October 31.\n\nRival factions of MPs are plotting how to take control of Parliamentary business if his attempts to get a deal crash and burn.\n\nOne group, the rebel alliance of sacked Tory MPs, hope to put a Brexit deal based on Mrs May\u2019s thrice-defeated plan before MPs.\n\nIt would include guarantees on rights and standards as well as giving Parliament a say over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU, in order to get the backing of Labour MPs with Leave seats.\n\nBut any proposal is unlikely to win the backing of the bulk of Labour MPs unless it has a second referendum attached to it.", "description": "Brussels negotiations look set to go down to the wire - and he hasn't even convinced his own party to back his plan", "authors": ["Pippa Crerar", "Image", "Reuters", "Pa", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20588259.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Britains-PM-Johnson-meets-NATO-Secretary-General-Stoltenberg-in-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
