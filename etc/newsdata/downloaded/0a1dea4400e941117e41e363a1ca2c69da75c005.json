We want to go out there and win,\u201d Pique said. \u201cWe hope that nobody tries to provoke fights that don\u2019t exist and that we don\u2019t want. We must back the club. If not, we will only hurt each other.\u201d\n\nLionel Messi has also expressed his doubts as to whether the club had done all it could to bring back Neymar.\n\nPique is one of Barcelona\u2019s pillars and a fan favorite with 505 appearances over nine seasons, including three Champions League titles and eight league titles. A World Cup winner with Spain, he has said he may consider running for club president at Barcelona after his playing days are over.\n\nThe spat comes as Barcelona prepares for its Champions League match against Inter Milan on Wednesday.\n\nSPAIN CALLING?\n\nWorld Cup winner Megan Rapinoe\u2019s declaration that she could one day play in Spain has not gone unnoticed.\n\nThe 34-year-old Rapinoe was awarded FIFA player of the year last week for leading the U.S. women\u2019s national team to the World Cup title in July. Barcelona star Lionel Messi won the men\u2019s award.\n\nRapinoe, whose six goals earned her the Golden Boot as the tournament\u2019s top scorer, told beIN SPORTS in an interview earlier this month that \u201cmaybe at the end of my career, I\u2019ll get over to Spain.\u201d\n\nRapinoe, who also won the Golden Ball as the tournament\u2019s top player, said: \u201cThe way Barcelona plays \u2026 is so beautiful and inspiring. It\u2019s just a joy to watch.\u201d\n\nShe also praised Atletico and Real Madrid.\n\nSince then Barcelona club official Maria Teixidor has said: \u201cI believe we would be in position to sign this class of player,\u201d while praising Rapinoe\u2019s leadership on seeking equality for women players.\n\nBarcelona newspaper La Vanguardia ran a story Sunday claiming \u201cRapinoe dyes herself burgundy and blue\u201d in reference to the club\u2019s colors and the player\u2019s dyed hair. Spanish sports daily AS speculated that Real Madrid, which is building up a women\u2019s team for next season, could try to entice the American star.\n\nWomen\u2019s soccer in Spain has made strides. The league has a major energy company as a sponsor, and offers three games a week to broadcast on television. More than 60,000 people packed Atletico\u2019s stadium in March to see the hosts lose 2-0 to Barcelona in what the league said was a world record for an attendance at a women\u2019s club soccer match.\n\nThat said, its players are still fighting to get a guaranteed minimum salary for all 16 first-division clubs and to have a collective labor deal to protect their rights.\n\nRapinoe, who played for French club Lyon for one season before joining the Seattle Reign in 2013, has spoken out about the plight of women players compared with their extremely well-paid male counterparts.\n\nWAITING FOR HAZARD\n\nEden Hazard has hustled and helped on defense, just like Zinedine Zidane has demanded of his players.\n\nBut Real Madrid didn\u2019t break a club transfer record to get a hard worker.\n\nIt needed a star to fill the void left by Cristiano Ronaldo, and so far Hazard has yet to come close.\n\nHazard missed the first three games of the campaign after injuring his left thigh in August. Since his return, he hasn\u2019t scored a goal in four appearances. Nor has he shown the attacking verve, dribbling skills, and precise passes that made him one of the Premier League\u2019s top players while at Chelsea.\n\nHazard didn\u2019t manage a single shot on goal at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in Saturday\u2019s Spanish capital derby.\n\nZidane has asked for patience.\n\n\u201cHe is almost there,\u201d Zidane said after the 0-0 draw at Atl\u00e9tico. \u201cWe have to support him. He is doing a good job.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Barcelona defender Gerard Pique has gone on the attack.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/spain_soccer_la_liga_54856_c0-7-3139-1837_s1770x1032.jpg?951a3f52e2e83521b137037406af54658b8013c3", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
