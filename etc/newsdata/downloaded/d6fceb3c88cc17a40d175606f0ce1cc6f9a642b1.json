If elected, she has said she will appoint regulators to undo anti-competitive tech mergers.\n\nBernie Sanders raised the second largest amount of money in Silicon Valley, about $155,000, according to the Bloomberg report by Eric Newcomer and Bill Allison that analyzed Federal Election Commission data. Sanders said that he \"absolutely\" supports breaking up big tech, and he has a plan to implement partial employee ownership of all large companies, which would affect these tech companies.\n\nRead more: Mark Zuckerberg and his wife have reportedly been privately recommending hires for the Buttigieg campaign\n\nPete Buttigieg, who Bloomberg reported ranked third in Silicon Valley donations, has a notably different position on big tech from those of Warren and Sanders.

Her campaign has been in contact with Facebook, Zuckerberg told NBC Nightly News. Zuckerberg has not spoken to Warren himself, but he says the company has been in contact over her concerns about its misinformation policies.\n\nBloomberg looked at contributions from ten large tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Apple, to arrive at these numbers. Employees at Google parent company Alphabet Inc. were the biggest donors, followed by Microsoft. Contributions from employees at all ten companies totalled about $752,000.", "description": "FEC data show that Elizabeth Warren is the top pick among Silicon Valley techies based on donations from tech workers, followed by Sanders and Buttigieg.", "authors": ["Mary Meisenzahl"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daf1fd1cc4a0a766c76eef3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
