I later used the line in Truth Hurts... I later learned that a tweet inspired the meme\", Lizzo said on Twitter.\n\n\"The creator of the tweet is the person I am sharing my success with...\"\n\nWhile she didn't name her, Mina responded shortly after with a tweet thanking Lizzo and her team.\n\nLizzo also mentions two men who claimed to have created the lyric with her in a writing session.\n\nJustin and Jeremiah Raisen said the line in question was taken from a song called Healthy that they wrote with Lizzo and two other writers in April 2017.\n\nThey say they'd been \"shutdown\" when trying to resolve the issue for the past two years.\n\nLizzo said they \"did not help me write any part of the song\".\n\n\"There was no-one in the room when I wrote Truth Hurts, except me, Ricky Reed, and my tears.\n\n\"That song is my life, and its words are my truth.\"\n\nEven though the song was released in 2017, the row began this year when Mina heard that Lizzo wanted to trademark the \"DNA\" phrase.\n\nIt was reported she wanted to use it on t-shirts, jackets, hats, bandanas and wristbands.\n\nLizzo said in an interview that after the initial reaction to Truth Hurts, she almost stopped making music, feeling it wasn't \"even making a splash\".\n\nBut the song began to grow in popularity and was added to the deluxe version of her 2019 debut album Cuz I Love You.\n\nIt's been a big year for Lizzo since then - she made her Coachella debut and Rihanna gave her a standing ovation after her performance at the BET Awards.\n\nShe also starred in the movie Hustlers alongside Jennifer Lopez and Cardi B.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "A woman from London is now a credited writer on Lizzo's Hot 100 song Truth Hurts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3CF5/production/_109350651_controv.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
