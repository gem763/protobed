Photo-Illustration: Konstantin Sergeyev/Intelligencer; Photo: Cengiz Yar/Getty Images\n\nIn recent years, gluten-free diets have been the subject of mockery from a certain type of American who thinks the country has gotten a little too soft. The kind of American who rolls his eyes at veganism and wears a necktie that looks like a slice of bacon. It\u2019s the type of American embodied by Ron Swanson, Nick Offerman\u2019s character from Parks and Recreation, whom the actor channeled in a 2015 NASCAR ad that goofed on gluten-free diets and drew an angry petition in response. How appropriate.\n\nIn 2016, Ted Cruz echoed Offerman\u2019s sentiment while running for president, equating a gluten-free diet to political correctness in a campaign speech. \u201cThe last thing any commander should need to worry about is the grades he is getting from some plush-bottomed Pentagon bureaucrat for political correctness or social experiments \u2014 or providing gluten-free MREs,\u201d Cruz said three months before he dropped out of the race, and seven months before he endorsed the man who called his wife ugly.\n\nThree years later, a lot has changed. Parks and Rec has finished its run. Cruz is a dutiful Trump follower. And, according to a study published this summer, Trump supporters are more likely to \u201cidentify as avoiding gluten, relative to non-supporters.\u201d Published in the June issue of Agriculture and Human Values, the study \u201cuncovers a complex relationship between the social construction of gluten avoidance and the potential role of political views,\u201d its authors write. As if Ted Cruz needed another \u201ccomplex relationship\u201d to navigate.", "description": "Conservatives may mock gluten-free diets, but according to a new study, Trump supporters are more likely to identify as gluten-free, compared to non-supporters.", "authors": ["Adam K.
