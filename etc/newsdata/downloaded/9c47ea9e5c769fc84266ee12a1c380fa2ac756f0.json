Photo: Selena Gomez/YouTube\n\nYou want everyone you care about to stick around forever, but the universe has other plans. People have other plans. Unexpected hardships happen, faults and failings we could never plan for. People flip, ghost, and flake. People change, and you can either work through your differences or around them. You either decide that your friend, your loved one, or your significant other is worth the trouble they put you through and fight to keep them in your life, or you fight for yourself, insisting that others treat you the way you deserve to be treated, on penalty of never seeing you again. Selena Gomez\u2019s new single \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d is a song about the process of figuring out that it\u2019s time to go, and locating the strength to act on your marching orders. Much will be made of who it\u2019s almost certainly about.\n\nThat harsh \u201cIn two months, you replaced us / Like it was easy\u201d in verse two points to Justin Bieber, who proposed to his ex Hailey Baldwin three months after breaking off his and Gomez\u2019s on-again, off-again romance last year. That makes the timing of the new single absolutely brutal. Hailey and Bieber haven\u2019t been married a month. All\u2019s fair in love and pop songs though: Bieb dropped Purpose during their last break and wrote Selena\u2019s name in the scribbles in his arty video for \u201cWhere Are \u00dc Now,\u201d a song about lifting someone up and feeling abandoned when they leave.\n\nGetting caught up in the timeline maybe loses sight of her song\u2019s quiet strength. It\u2019s not your typical accusatory breakup song. It\u2019s a rearview assessment of two people drifting apart that assigns blame to both parties: \u201cI saw the signs, and I ignored them.\u201d \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d is also a noteworthy change of pace for Gomez\u2019s music. Recent singles like \u201cWolves\u201d and \u201cBack to You\u201d tried folk-pop on for size, and this year\u2019s killer musica urbana jam \u201cI Can\u2019t Get Enough\u201d paired her with Benny Blanco, Tainy, and J. Balvin. \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d is naked honesty, lyrically and musically.\n\nBoth the song and the video seat the singer up close at center stage with little else to distract from her truth. The production teams her up with singer-songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels and producer duo Mattman and Robin, the same squad she worked with on Revival\u2019s \u201cHands to Myself.\u201d (\u201cLose You\u201d also features a noteworthy co-producer credit for Finneas O\u2019Connell, who mostly only produces for himself and his sister, Billie Eilish. It won\u2019t be long before you see his name on everything.) The credits are crowded, but the song is spare. The loudest it gets is the choir of Selenas that back the second and final choruses. Accompanying her unbridled truth with echos of her own voice is a nifty way to make the sound of the song mirror the words. It was a gamble trusting that the lyrics to this song would sell it on their own, but it was a wise one.", "description": "Selena Gomez\u2019s new single \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d is a song about the process of figuring out it\u2019s time to go.
