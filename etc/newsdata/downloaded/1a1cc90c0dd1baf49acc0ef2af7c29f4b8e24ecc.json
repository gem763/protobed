It comes after a radicalised police IT specialist slashed four colleagues to death on October, 3.\n\nMicka\u00ebl Harpon, a police computer specialist who prosecutors say followed a \u201cradical vision of Islam,\u201d stabbed three officers and an administrator to death at Paris\u2019 police headquarters last Thursday, before he was shot dead by a patrolman. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner described Harpon\u2019s attack as a \u201cserious failure\u201d of the state to detect \u201csigns of radicalization.\u201d\n\nParis Police Chief Didier Lallement advised officers on Monday to \u201cimmediately report\u201d signs of \u201cpossible radicalization of an agent,\u201d Le Parisien reported. The newspaper described an atmosphere of \u201cparanoia\u201d spreading through the ranks.\n\nAlso on rt.com Radical Islamist police officer who killed his Paris colleagues had TOP SECRET security clearance & info on UNDERCOVER COPS\n\nTwo officers have already been disciplined, the newspaper says. One, at Paris\u2019 Villeneuve-la-Garenne police station, was disarmed. He earlier began praying in work, refused to shake hands with women, and proselytized to his colleagues. The officer had already been dismissed from the force last year for his behavior, but was later reinstated after filing an appeal.\n\nThe officer had been in the spotlight before, after he was photographed with a friend of the terrorist who plowed his vehicle into six soldiers in the city in 2017. He later told a terrorism investigation that appearing in the photograph was \u201ca mistake.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Paris police knifeman had \u2018radical vision of Islam,\u2019 anti-terrorism prosecutors say\n\nAnother officer, also based in Paris, has been disarmed and suspended for similar activity. In 2011, the officer was reported for refusing to contact female staff and for praying during work after marrying a Muslim. However he was not considered to have been a radicalized person at that point.\n\nParis\u2019 police department is a venerable and sprawling institution, dating back to the 17th century and employing more than 34,000 people. The intelligence division which Harpon worked in operates autonomously from the national security agency, the DGSI, and has been criticized by DGSI personnel for its supposedly weak background checks and operational security.\n\nYet, the department has never had to investigate its own members for Islamic radicalization before, at least not publicly.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
