Being a skip, hop and a jump from the slopes brings with it a significant price premium and a real-estate market that has its own rhythms and practicalities.\n\nBuyers should make sure they\u2019re aware of what the area is like in all seasons, and that they\u2019re prepared to deal with the level of snow they might be regularly getting. Many are looking for a home for ski vacations but come to find they love the summer months as well. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to consider what is a property like in different seasons. If you\u2019re just looking in the winter, think about what is this property going to be like in the summer,\u201d says Aspen real-estate agent Carrie Wells. Mrs. Wells says that despite Aspen being a ski area, she\u2019s recently noticed more sales happening in the summer.\n\nAgents see many factors that account for the high prices in locales like Aspen, which has only around 7,000 full-time residents, and Sun Valley, Idaho, where the remote location makes commuting in more difficult. \u201cMost of these resorts are smaller resorts and so you don\u2019t have a stable labor force. You\u2019ve got a labor force, but it is limited. Obviously, construction costs are going to be higher in a smaller area than they are in a major city where you\u2019ve got lots of competition and lots of workers available,\u201d says Suzanne Williams, owner of Sun Valley Real Estate/Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. Mrs. Williams sees higher prices per foot in a place like Sun Valley, where the population was 1,473 as of 2018, than popular ski destinations like Jackson, Wyo., which has a much larger supply of workers.\n\nLand use regulations limit new development and growth, and a limited supply drives up prices. They also shape the look and character of the town. \u201cIt makes for a beautiful area, because we do have height restrictions and limited growth, but that means what is developed becomes more rare and pricey,\u201d Mrs. Wells says. \u201cUnlike other resort areas where they don\u2019t have land use codes in place or they don\u2019t have limited growth, it has a different character. It looks different.\u201d\n\nDorset, Vt.\n\nPhoto: David Barnum\n\nThis home in Dorset, Vt., has views of the Green Mountain National Forest.
