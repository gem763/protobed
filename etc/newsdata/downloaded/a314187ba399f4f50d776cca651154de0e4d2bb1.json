Labour have placed him under investigation.\n\nThe cartoons, from website 'Jesus and Mo', show Jesus questioning the Prophet on his marriage to his third wife Aisha among other things.\n\nSome scholars claim Aisha was just nine-years-old when she married Mohammed.\n\nIn Islam any depiction of the Prophet Mohammed is highly offensive.\n\nThe Website 'Jesus and Mo' describes itself as a 'weekly comic strip dealing in religious satire'.\n\nLabour councillor Khayer Chowdhury, who is also from Ilford where Mr Bridgman is believed to be based, is demanding his party take action on the offensive posts.\n\nHe described them as 'shocking' and said his Muslim Labour colleague was 'distressed' when he saw them on his Facebook page.\n\nLabour MP for Ilford North Wes Streeting branded it a 'disgrace' and wrote: 'Please report immediately to Labour for investigation and action.'\n\nLocal Labour polticians, including Ilford North MP Wes Streeting has demanded Labour take action\n\nAn MHCLG spokesman told MailOnline: 'While we cannot discuss individual staffing matters, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government takes a zero-tolerance approach to any form of racism or religious discrimination.\n\n'Discriminatory behaviour of any kind is completely unacceptable. We expect all departmental employees to uphold the values and behaviours of the Civil Service as set out in the Civil Service Code.\n\n'We will take appropriate action where people fall short of that expectation.'\n\nA Labour spokesman added: \u2018The Labour Party takes all complaints of this nature extremely seriously, which are fully investigated and any appropriate disciplinary action taken in line with the Party\u2019s rules and procedures. We cannot comment on individual cases.\"\n\nThey added that the posts only came to their attention this week, not three months ago as claimed by the complainant, and took immediate action.\n\nMailOnline has attempted to contact Mr Bridgman for comment.", "description": "East London Labour Party member Martin Bridgman shared offensive cartoons of Jesus and Mohammed, including ones that alluded to child rape.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/13/19921726-0-image-a-46_1571487347925.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
