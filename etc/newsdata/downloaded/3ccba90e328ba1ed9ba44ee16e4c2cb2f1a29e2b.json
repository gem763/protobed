(Picture: PA)\n\nYou might be used to seeing Christmas displays pop up from December, with lights and Father Christmases brightening houses.\n\nNow, a family are taking things a step further by transforming their entire terraced home into a house of horrors.\n\nThey will no doubt give passing drivers a fright with the ghoulish decorations, including a ghost suspended from the second floor and a set of gallows in the garden.\n\nThere is a skeletal bat and a giant tarantula, as well as a zombie nun, guillotine and a demon riding a bicycle.\n\nFrancis McIsaac and partner Julie Smith spent nine days preparing their end-of-terrace house in Norris Green, Liverpool, for the spooky season.\n\nIce cream man Mr McIsaac, 51, said: \u2018We\u2019ve been doing this about six years. We started doing it for our own kids when they were younger and it just grew and grew.\u2019\n\nThe end-of-terrace house is transformed each Halloween (Picture: PA)\n\nDark (Picture: PA)\n\nThere\u2019s even a spooky dog next to the electric chair (Picture: PA)\n\nThere\u2019s someone in the stocks (Picture: PA)\n\nWould you go to visit? (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s nice to give something back to the community.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you live nearby, you can go and check it out as the gardens are open for people to look around between 6pm and 9pm in the week leading up to Halloween.\n\nThe family are collecting donates for nearby Sandfield Park School, for children with disabilities.\n\nMr McIsaac, a grandfather-of-four, makes many of the moving props himself in the garage of the house, and on Halloween itself the family put on costumes to scare the visitors.\n\nHe said: \u2018People love the house, although their reactions are not so good when we jump out at them.\n\n\u2018There are children who have been coming to see it since they were one and are now seven years old.\n\nThere\u2019s a spooky circus (Picture: PA)\n\nThe three witches (Picture: PA)\n\nThey\u2019ve recreated Freddy Krueger (Picture: PA)\n\nGhoul on a trike (Picture: PA)\n\nA man-eating spider (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018My partner enjoys Halloween more than me, but I like making all the props.\n\n\u2018Usually it takes me six to eight hours to make something, but if it\u2019s an animated prop it can take a little longer.\u2019\n\nLast year, the house of horrors made \u00a3700 for the school, but the couple hope to raise even more.\n\nMr McIsaac said: \u2018This year we have had more than 2,000 shares of the pictures we put on Facebook.\n\n\u2018Last year we had to close the doors and only let a few people in at a time and this year we think it will be even busier.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
