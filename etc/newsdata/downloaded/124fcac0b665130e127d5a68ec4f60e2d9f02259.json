REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe move would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies, two of the sources said. One said it was motivated by the Trump administration\u2019s growing security concerns about the companies\u2019 activities.\n\nMajor U.S. stock indexes slipped on the news, which came days before China celebrates the 70th anniversary of the birth of the People\u2019s Republic on Oct. 1, when the world\u2019s No. 2 economy will shut down for a week of festivities.\n\nShares of Hangzhou, Zhejiang-based Alibaba (BABA.N) ended down 5.15%. JD.com (JD.O) fell 5.95% and Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) declined 3.67%. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI.P) shed 1.15%.\n\nShares of New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) ended down 1.88% and shares of Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) declined 1.70%.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how any delisting would work.\n\nIn June, U.S. lawmakers from both parties introduced a bill to force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight, including providing access to audits, or face delisting.\n\nChinese authorities have long been reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms - including member firms of the Big Four international accounting networks - citing national security concerns.\n\n\u201cBeijing should no longer be allowed to shield U.S.-listed Chinese companies from complying with American laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability,\u201d Republican Senator Marco Rubio said at the time.\n\nOne of the sources briefed on the matter said the idea of delisting was the latest salvo in this longstanding dispute.\n\n\u201cThis is a very high priority for the administration. Chinese companies not complying with the PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) process poses risks to U.S. investors,\u201d the source said.\n\nAny plan is subject to approval by Trump, who has given the green light to the discussion, Bloomberg reported here citing a person close to the deliberations.\n\nOfficials are also examining how the United States could put limits on Chinese companies included in stock indexes managed by U.S. firms, the agency cited three sources as saying.\n\nNo decision or action is imminent, two sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.\n\nAs of February, 156 Chinese companies were listed on the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchanges, according to U.S. government data, including at least 11 state-owned firms. (bit.ly/2nUXQaD)\n\nNYSE declined to comment on Friday, while Nasdaq, MSCI, S&P and FTSE Russell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nChina's yuan currency, traded in offshore markets CNH=, fell against the dollar after the news to trade near its weakest against the greenback in about three weeks.\n\nPLOY?\n\nTrade talks between the United States and China are expected to be held Oct. 10-11 after months of tit-for-tat moves by both sides which have weakened global growth and driven rollercoaster moves in markets.\n\nWhile the idea of delisting could be a maneuver ahead of those talks, the main aim was to counteract the civilian-military fusion of Chinese technology firms, the Made in China 2025 industrial development program targeting key industries for domination and a growing surveillance state in Xinjiang, one of the sources said.\n\nThe source said there are longstanding concerns about U.S. capital enabling these activities, especially as the lines blur between state-owned and private companies in China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very disruptive, it just adds to uncertainty and it\u2019s a big negative for business investment,\u201d said Scott Brown, chief economist at investment bank Raymond James. He noted, however, that both sides have used aggressive moves in the past ahead of talks.\n\n\u201cYou never know if it\u2019s a ploy to get some leverage,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump on Tuesday criticized Beijing\u2019s trade practices in a speech at the United Nations, but the next day stoked hopes that the nearly 15-month standoff could be nearing an end.\n\n\u201cThey want to make a deal very badly ... It could happen sooner than you think,\u201d he told reporters in New York on Wednesday.\n\nChina says it cannot allow its companies to submit to oversight by PCOAB because of rules prohibiting the storage, processing or transfer of any material considered to be state secrets or national security matters.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump arrives for a photo opportunity with sheriffs from across the country on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., September 26, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\nU.S. hedge fund manager Kyle Bass, a prominent critic of China, said on Friday that Chinese companies should have to play by U.S. rules if they want to sell to U.S. investors.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. should require any securities sold in the US to adhere to US Securities Laws.
