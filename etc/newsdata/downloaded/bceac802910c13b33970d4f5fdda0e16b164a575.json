USA TODAY\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany \u2014 Fresh off winning her fifth all-around title at the world championships, Simone Biles sat down with USA TODAY Sports. In a wide-ranging exclusive interview, she talked about her legacy, why she feels it\u2019s important for female athletes to speak out, her love-hate relationship with the balance beam and what she plans to do after the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nYou said last night that sometimes you can\u2019t believe what you\u2019re doing. Does it ever really sink in?\n\nBiles: I feel like we don\u2019t have time. I feel like once it sinks in, we\u2019re back in the States and it\u2019s like a celebratory moment. That\u2019s when it kind of hits you.\n\nCan you still go out in public without being recognized?\n\nBiles: No. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m grateful for it, but at times, I just want to go to the store and not be recognized. So it has its ups and downs. It definitely has its perks, but it definitely has its problems, as well. Like not being able to go anywhere.\n\nSimone Biles says she can feel like she's going in many different directions while at a competition.

If we got to an amusement park or concert, that\u2019s the hardest.\n\nWhen you decided to come back after taking a year off, did you expect that you\u2019d top what you did in 2016?\n\nBiles: No. I definitely thought 2016 was probably going to be the pinnacle of my career. Coming back, I was really nervous if I could top my 2016 performances.\n\nOnce we started training and putting more skills in, and we competed for the first time, I was like, 'Wow, I think I am better than 2016.' That\u2019s what blew my mind. Just looking at the differences in the videos. Even with my form, it\u2019s a little bit cleaner, too, on some of the things because we\u2019ve paid attention to detail there.\n\nYou said last night you\u2019ve finally gotten your confidence back on balance beam. What caused you to lose it and how did you get it back?\n\nBiles: It took a while. I have this love-hate relationship with the beam. I\u2019ve always told myself, 'If you hate beam, the beam will hate you.'\n\nGoing into 2016, I was pretty confident because at the worlds leading up to that, I had always done pretty well on beam. (Biles won the world title on balance beam in 2014 and 2015.) Then 2016 kind of shut me down. And it\u2019s not just the performance because I knew it wasn\u2019t the best. Even though I still got a bronze medal (at the Rio Olympics), it\u2019s just like, what everybody else says. 'You shouldn\u2019t even have got a bronze.'\n\nIf you watch the performance, we had two warm-ups: we had a medals ceremony (one) and we had our Team USA stuff. If you watch, I put my Team USA gear back on because I knew I wasn\u2019t going to medal with the performance I had given. I really thought Flavia (Saraiva of Brazil) was going to have it.\n\nThen the score came up and I barely beat Flavia. So then I had to get the medals ceremony outfit out. That\u2019s when it kind of blew my mind, like I can have mistakes and still medal.\n\nAfter that, coming back, I just didn\u2019t want to do a performance like that. I had had repeats and I had fallen on beam, so that also shot my confidence down. I was like, 'I guess I\u2019m just never going to do well on beam again.\u2019 Finally this year, I took out some of the moves I was feeling a little bit uncertain with.\n\nAnd I felt like every time I went to go do a front tuck or a front pike, I relived Rio. Even if they were good. I didn\u2019t want that to happen again. So I was in a constant fear, basically.\n\nWhen did that change?\n\nBiles: Probably as soon as we took it out. Then you wonder what other skill \u2013 because it\u2019s always something. Even if you take out a trouble skill, another skill wants to trouble you.\n\nThankfully it\u2019s all good right now so I\u2019m good.\n\nGrowing up, who was your favorite athlete?\n\nBiles: Ooh. Alicia Sacramone.\n\nAnyone from another sport?\n\nBiles: I feel like Serena Williams. Just because she\u2019s always been so dominant and she\u2019s always spoken out and she shows her real, raw emotions. I think that\u2019s important, that you don\u2019t have to hide that.\n\nYou could be describing yourself.\n\nBiles: I think I\u2019ve learned as I\u2019ve gotten older that it\u2019s OK to show real, raw emotion. You don\u2019t have to be a robot all the time, and you don\u2019t always have to seem happy out there.\n\nIt seems as if you allow people to see who you really are. Is that a conscious choice?\n\nI feel like it\u2019s easier to gauge how I\u2019m feeling. I think it also shows kids that it\u2019s OK, if you\u2019re enjoying the moment, to smile, to be happy. If you\u2019re not having a good time, it\u2019s OK, you don\u2019t have to hide that from people. I\u2019m not saying you should scream or punch things. You could probably do that behind the scenes. But if you\u2019re upset you can show that you\u2019re upset.\n\nWhere do you keep all of your medals?\n\nBiles: My Mom keeps them in a safe. She\u2019s the medal keeper. I actually have one \u2013 a huge shadow box with a lot of my medals that my Mom made for me. It\u2019s at the gym, in my office. That one\u2019s pretty cool.\n\nDo you have a favorite?\n\nBiles: I don\u2019t know. As bad as it is, I always like to reflect on my (Rio) beam performance. Just because it wasn\u2019t the best, but I still medaled so I can only be thankful for that. I feel like it also made me realize that not every performance is going to be great, but it\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over. I feel like going into every competition, I have to remind myself that: No matter what happens, even if it\u2019s not the best performance, it might not be over.\n\nI feel like every gold-medal winning performance is a highlight, but sometimes I like to think of the things that made me better as a person. It\u2019s those times where I didn\u2019t go out and do my best, but it still went OK in the end.\n\nWith Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt retired, you will be the face of the Tokyo Olympics. Are you prepared for that?\n\nBiles: I\u2019ve never really thought about that. I guess going into previous Olympics, you heard about Usain and Michael Phelps. They probably felt the weight of the world on their shoulders.\n\nBut I\u2019m pretty good at managing that just because I try to stay focused on myself and the expectations I have for myself going in. But at times it\u2019s overwhelming. (pause) I don\u2019t know. Somehow, I just manage it.\n\nI get nervous too and I have my freak-out moments. I try to just relax and calm myself. \u2026 Put some headphones on. Or you\u2019ll see me breathing deeply so I can slow my heart rate down.\n\nYou said after team finals that you wanted to \u201cvomit\u201d before it started. Do you still get nervous before competitions?\n\nBiles: Sometimes. Mainly on bars. I wish I never had to compete that again.\n\nSimone Biles, left, has been pushed by her coach, Laurent Landi, to add new skills. (Photo: Laurence Griffiths, Getty Images)\n\nBut your uneven bars have gotten so much better with coach Laurent Landi. Did you ever foresee that?\n\nBiles: No. No. Never in a million years.\n\nHow much, then, did your silver medal on uneven bars at last year\u2019s worlds mean to you?\n\nBiles: Oh my God, that was probably the highlight of my year. Of my career. It might be the only bar medal I ever get.\n\nIs there anything left for you to accomplish?\n\nBiles: I feel like I still have a lot to accomplish. But my main goal is to go out there and compete beam with confidence and hopefully do well in that event because I know how strong I am. Even though I got a bronze, I\u2019m hoping for a little bit better because I know I\u2019m capable of it.\n\nAny more upgrades or new skills before Tokyo?\n\nBiles: We\u2019re kind of solidifying the things now to go into Tokyo. You don\u2019t want to worry about upgrades going into the new year or competing them. So probably solidify them.\n\nWhen Laurent suggested some of your new skills, what did you think?\n\nBiles: I just laughed. I just thought it was funny. I\u2019m like, 'There\u2019s no way.' Because I thought 2016 was the peak. Anything he suggested that was outside of what I did in 2016, I was like, 'Yeah, there\u2019s no way.\u2019\n\nSo he suggests it, you say no way and then what?\n\nBiles: And then I have to decide. It has to be on my terms. He can suggest it and push for it and push for it. And then it\u2019ll be a good day and I\u2019ll be like, 'OK, I think I can do it.\u2019 It kind of stems from there.\n\nWhat do you want your legacy to be?\n\nBiles: I guess the dominance that I\u2019ve had. Also, the real, raw true me. I feel like, yes, I\u2019m an athlete, but at the end of the day, I hope they look at me as a normal person as well. With showing the emotions and the character and how I carry myself.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to teach our female youth that, that it\u2019s OK to say, `Yes, I am good at this,\u2019 and you don\u2019t hold back. You only see the men doing it. And they\u2019re praised for it and the women are looked down upon for it. But I feel like it\u2019s good because once you realize you\u2019re confident and good at it, then you\u2019re even better at what you do.\n\nI feel like we should teach the youth that it\u2019s OK to say, 'Yes, I am good.\u2019 And it\u2019s not out of cockiness. It is what it is, at the end of the day. I\u2019ve won five world titles and if I say, `I\u2019m the best gymnast there is,\u2019 (the reaction is), 'Oh, she\u2019s cocky, look at her now.\u2019 No, the facts are literally on the paper. I think it\u2019s important to teach the youth that.\n\nSo do you have a GOAT T-shirt?\n\nBiles: No, but my boyfriend does.\n\nHow important is his support and that of your family?\n\nI think it\u2019s important, for my whole entire family, to know that I have their support because without it, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do what I do and be as good as I am. It just means a lot to me.\n\nWill you really be done after Tokyo?\n\nBiles: I think so. Probably. He (nods at Landi) wants me to go further.\n\nLandi: It\u2019s not, 'He wants me.\u2019 You will not do it if it\u2019s coming from us. You will stop when you feel it\u2019s done.\n\nBiles: I feel it today. Walking to breakfast I was like, 'Ooh.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s going back to a five-person team (for the Paris Olympics in 2024) and you could have a specialist. But I don\u2019t know, floor routines are hard. It\u2019s not easy.\n\nI\u2019ve always just thought that I don\u2019t want gymnastics to be my whole entire life. I just want it to be a part of my life, a piece of legacy that I put in the books. Then I have to move on and continue with the rest of my life. Whatever that may be. I don\u2019t know yet.", "description": "Having qualified for all four event finals, Simone Biles likely to surpass Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus' record of 23 medals at the world championships", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published A.M.
