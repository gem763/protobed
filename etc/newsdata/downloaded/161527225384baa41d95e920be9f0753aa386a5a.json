Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski single-handedly embarrassed the Democratic House Judiciary Committee. Even CNN said he \"owned\" Rep. Nadler, Rep Swalwell, and the rest of the kooky cabal. It was a giant waste of taxpayer money. However, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan brought up perhaps the most important fact of Lewandowski's testimony. He, former FBI Director James Comey, and special counsel investigator Robert Mueller all gave the same answer -- the Trump campaign never colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election.\n\n\"@CLewandowski_ worked with the Trump campaign for nearly 2 years. He testified they did not collude or coordinate with Russia. Sounds familiar. James Comey, sitting at the same table as Lewandowski: same answer. Bob Mueller: same table, same answer. Time to move on,\" Rep. Jordan tweeted.\n\n.@CLewandowski_ worked with the Trump campaign for nearly 2 years. He testified they did not collude or coordinate with Russia.

Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) September 17, 2019\n\nDuring the testimony, Rep. Jordan showed why he is one of the best communicators in the GOP.\n\n\"Pretty good campaign you ran, I mean you beat what 17-18 different opponents? Senators, governors -- good Senators. Of course, you had a pretty good candidate,\" Rep. Jordan remarked to Lewandowski.\n\n\"The best,\" he interjected.\n\n\"I think he's done a great job as president of the United States,\" Rep. Jordan added. \"After you left the campaign, I think you left in June of 2016 after you left, the head of the campaign were you still involved with the campaign throughout the rest of the election all the way up through November 8th 2016?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Lewandowski responded.\n\n\"So, you were part of the campaign operation at some level or another from January 2015 to November 8, 2016 during that entire time do you guys ever work with Russia to impact the election?\"\n\n\"No,\" Lewandowski answered.\n\n\"And you know what's interesting Mr. Lewandowski? When Jim Comey was asked that same question, sitting at that same table, he gave the same answer! Bob Mueller was asked that same question, sitting at that same table, he gave the same answer!\" Rep. Jordan continued. \"Falsely accused - the president is falsely accused of colluding with a foreign state to impact the election! Jim Comey, when we deposed him at that very table, said, 'After 10 months of investigation, we didn't have a thing.' Bob Mueller gets named special counsel. He wastes 30 million dollars of taxpayer money, 22-month investigation. He sits at that table just a few weeks ago and gives the same darn answer. These guys over here, they don't care they don't care.\" (emphasis added)\n\n\"They don't want to get to, what Mr. Chabot said, they don't want to figure out how the false accusation happened, \" Mr. Jordan said of House Democrats. \"They just want to drag people in front of this committee and keep trying to find some way they can go after the president.\"\n\nRep. Jordan is exactly right. The Democrats are wasting time, taxpayer money, and their efforts in their desperate attempt to take down President Donald J. Trump. That is temporarily bad for the country, but it is good for the president's re-election chances -- Which is actually great for America.", "description": "\"They just want to drag people in front of this committee and keep trying to find some way they can go after the president.\" \r\n\r\n.09/18/2019 19:19:29PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/260/65e51682-403f-46f1-ae65-6d838ce56089.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
