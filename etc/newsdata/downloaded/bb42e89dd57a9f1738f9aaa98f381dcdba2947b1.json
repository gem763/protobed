He will not have meetings with officials from the Trump administration.\n\nAssange had enjoyed asylum since 2012 at the embassy in London but relations between the silver-haired Australian and Ecuadorian officials had grown increasingly tense.\n\nMoreno's government has accused Assange of creating conflict by meddling in international affairs, harassing staff and even smearing faeces on the embassy's walls.\n\nAssange is in custody in London awaiting sentencing for skipping bail to avoid being sent to Sweden as part of an investigation into a rape allegation.\n\nThe US is also seeking his extradition after charging him with conspiring to break into a Pentagon computer system.\n\nEcuador's president suggested Assange was able to operate equipment and collaborate with embassy staffers for a long time thanks to the support of Moreno's predecessor, Rafael Correa, who granted asylum to Assange.\n\n\"There are other answers that fit with someone's else money, which (this person) kept taking away from Ecuador in order to keep power and in order to go back to power,\" Moreno said without referring specifically to Correa at first.\n\nBut at a later point, Moreno said \"the president\" spends $3m a month to propagate his ideas and has been receiving an unspecified amount of money from the socialist government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to perform economic studies.\n\nCo-operation\n\nMoreno said his government has not requested co-operation from the US for the investigation of Assange and Bini. But, he added, \"If we need it, we will request. Let's not forget this is a country with very high technology.\"\n\nEcuadorian Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo contends Bini travelled at least 12 times to meet with Assange at the London embassy. She says he was also in Venezuela earlier this year around the same time as a close aide to Correa.\n\nProsecutors have said they intend to charge Bini with hacking-related crimes and had him ordered detained for up to 90 days while they compile evidence.\n\nBini's father said his son works as a software developer for a non-profit group and has a \"burning passion\" for freedom of speech and online personal integrity issues.\n\nHe said he is convinced his son is innocent and will remain in Ecuador until he is released.\n\n\"For us, it's surreal to think Ola is involved in these things, these accusations,\" Gustafasson said.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Ecuador's president is accusing Julian Assange of hosting numerous hackers at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to give them directions on how to propagate information on topics important to the WikiLeaks founder and his financiers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8754/3acba64c92bd4ee9a801ad80064d1fe7.png", "published_at": "2019-04-17"}
