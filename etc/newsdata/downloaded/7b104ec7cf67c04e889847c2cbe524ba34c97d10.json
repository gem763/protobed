Another man allegedly told the FBI he distributed speeches by a now-deceased terrorist, and a third allegedly admitted he engaged in militant acts in Somalia but he contended the admissions were coerced through interrogation.\n\nJudge Fisher wrote that the court examined the government\u2019s full explanations and concluded that \u201can unclassified summary of the undisclosed reasons was not possible.\u201d\n\nEach plaintiff had \u201cfair notice\u201d that their alleged conduct, such as traveling abroad for weapons training with organizations linked to terrorism, \u201cwould raise suspicion\u201d under the published standards, Fisher said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: San Francisco Chronicle, http://www.sfgate.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The largely secret criteria for the government's no-fly list have been upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a case involving four people who sued over being barred from flying.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
