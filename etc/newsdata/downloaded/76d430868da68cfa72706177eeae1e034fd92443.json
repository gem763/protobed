Well, kind of.\n\nJustin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin tied the knot for the second time, one year after legally getting married in a New York City courthouse. The star-studded shindig took place in South Carolina, not far from luxury vacation destination Hilton Head Island, with a weekend of festivities culminating in a ceremony and reception for 150 guests.\n\nThe lead-up to the big day was not without drama. It was initially reported that the wedding would take place at the beginning of March, coinciding with Bieber\u2019s 25th birthday. However, March 1 came and went without wedding bells. A source told People that the ceremony was delayed indefinitely while the pop star focused on his mental health. Finally, in August, TMZ obtained a save-the-date card featuring comic book-style renderings of the happy couple with the date and location confirmed: Sept. 30, 2019, in South Carolina.\n\nThe celebration took place over the weekend at the Montage Palmetto Bluff resort, much to the apparent dismay of the hotel\u2019s guests. Sources told TMZ that guests were \u201clivid\u201d about the disruption caused by the A-list affair, alleging that they were only informed five days before that the Biebers were closing down the pool, spa, and \u201cfancy\u201d restaurant from Sunday to Tuesday.\n\nWedding guests arrived at the rehearsal dinner on Sunday evening via water taxi. The bride wore a simple ivory Vivienne Westwood minidress, showing off tan legs and breathtaking tulle-trimmed Jimmy Choo heels. Her hair was pulled off of her face with a matching silk ribbon, exposing the model\u2019s razor-sharp cheekbones. Biebs, meanwhile, eschewed his typical disheveled surfer-dude look for freshly-cropped hair and a fitted white polo shirt.\n\nFollowing the formal rehearsal dinner, Sunday\u2019s celebration turned into something resembling a child\u2019s dream birthday bash (which checks out, as the weekend was reportedly planned by Mindy Weiss, the mastermind behind Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott\u2019s daughter\u2019s first birthday extravaganza). According to TMZ, the couple hosted a deluxe slumber party at the hotel, complete with bowling, capture the flag, and a midnight water gun fight. Though there is no photographic evidence of the latter, try to imagine a flock of Victoria\u2019s Secret Angels teetering in stilettos whilst attempting to shield their impeccably made-up faces from the business end of a Super Soaker.\n\nTo set a cheery tone for the big day (and to perhaps shed some light on why they chose to celebrate in South Carolina), the Biebers then forced all of their friends to watch The Notebook. This film choice alone could be used as evidence of why 22-year-olds are too young to get married, which I am allowed to say as someone who was very recently 22 herself.\n\nNot much has been revealed about the ceremony itself, though it undoubtedly was extremely Christian. During their courtship last summer, the lovebirds were frequently spotted attending church services together, and Bieber has been outspoken about how his spirituality has helped him work through mental health struggles.\n\nIn a February cover story for Vogue, the \u201cSorry\u201d singer explained that he underwent a period of celibacy prior to reconnecting with Baldwin (the two had dated on-and-off in the past): \u201cI wanted to rededicate myself to God in that way because I really felt it was better for my soul. And I believe that God blessed me with Hailey as a result.\u201d Last month, Stephen Baldwin told TMZ that his daughter\u2019s wedding ceremony would feature \u201ca lot of their pastor friends and a lot of their Christian friends.\u201d\n\nThe high-powered guest list was also comprised of Hailey\u2019s squad of supermodel BFFs, including Kendall Jenner, Joan Smalls, and Camila Morrone, as well as Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott, Ed Sheeran, Jaden Smith, Usher, and Scooter Braun. The bride\u2019s famous father, The Usual Suspects actor Stephen Baldwin, was in attendance, though her uncle Alec Baldwin skipped the f\u00eate. It was previously reported that Hailey\u2019s sister Alaia and her cousin Ireland would be bridesmaids. Even Justin\u2019s ex circa 2008, Caitlin Beadles, scored an invite.\n\nFor the after-party, Hailey channeled Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding reception look in a crisp white halter dress. She also donned a pricey Celine leather jacket with \u201cWife\u201d embroidered on the back. The bride and groom both opted for classic Tiffany & Co. wedding bands\u2014two 18-karat gold, diamond-studded rings for Hailey, priced at $3,125 and $2,150, and a 4.5-millimeter simple gold band for Justin at $950. It was her blinding, $123,000 diamond earrings, however, that stole the show in photobooth pictures from the evening. It wouldn\u2019t be a Bieber wedding without ostentatious bling, after all. Social media snaps reveal custom, bedazzled bottles of Mo\u00ebt & Chandon bubbly, encrusted with 9,682 Swarovski crystals. And in a picture shared by the bride, Justin flashes his sparkling grill.\n\nTrue to form, the Jenner sisters have already flooded Instagram with wedding content, showing off their enviable outfits\u2014a formfitting, moss green velvet look for Kendall and a metallic, sculptural gown with a cutout on the bodice for Kylie. Newsfeeds will likely be littered for days with the same high-contrast, black-and-white photobooth photos that signify a Kardashian-adjacent soiree. The (sort-of) newlyweds also posted some loved-up snaps for themselves. Bieber concisely captioned his tribute, \u201cMy bride is (fire emoji).\u201d\n\nNo word yet on honeymoon plans, but the couple\u2019s Vogue interview from earlier this year offers a glimpse into their idea of married life together. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be hard,\u201d Hailey said candidly in the profile. \u201cYou don\u2019t wake up every day saying, \u2018I\u2019m absolutely so in love and you are perfect.\u2019 That\u2019s not what being married is. But there\u2019s something beautiful about it anyway\u2014about wanting to fight for something, commit to building with someone.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWe\u2019re really young, and that\u2019s a scary aspect. We\u2019re going to change a lot. But we\u2019re committed to growing together and supporting each other in those changes.\u201d", "description": "The A-list affair featured plenty of Kardashian-Jenners, a pajama party, a water gun battle, and a screening of \u201cThe Notebook,\u201d among other things.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569989667/191001-alaina-bieber-tease_ybybqj"}
