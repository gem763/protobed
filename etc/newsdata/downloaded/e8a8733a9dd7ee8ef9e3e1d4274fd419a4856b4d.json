That would greatly increase the price of fossil fuel-based energy - especially from the burning of coal - but the economic disruption could be offset by routeing the money raised straight back to citizens.\n\n\u201cIf you compare the average level of the carbon tax today, which is $2 (\u00a31.60) [a ton], to where we need to be, it's a quantum leap,\u201d said Paolo Mauro, deputy director of the fiscal affairs department at the IMF.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The Federal Reserve, for example, is taking a closer look at how climate change may pose a risk to economic stability.\n\nIn the United States, a $75 tax would cut emissions by nearly 30% but would cause on average a 53% increase in electricity costs and a 20% rise for petrol at projected 2030 prices, the analysis in the IMF's Fiscal Monitor found.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He co-wrote a paper published Monday arguing that a carbon price should start high and gradually be reduced to take into account future damage costs from global warming.\n\n\u201cIf one takes climate risk and uncertainty seriously, the numbers rise much higher still,\u201d Mr Wagner said in an email.\n\nMost economists and policymakers have designed carbon tax policies that start relatively low and ramp up quickly over time. Proponents say it would minimise economic hardship for consumers and companies for their past choices while changing future decisions such as purchases of polluting equipment or automobiles.\n\nThe Nobel Prize winning Yale economist William Nordhaus has argued that a carbon tax of $300 (\u00a3237) per ton or even higher might be required.\n\n\u201cTheir estimate is, in my view, if anything on the low side of what is needed\u201d but on the high side compared with policies already being implemented in some countries, Mr Nordhaus said in an email.\n\nMoreover, the latest science suggests the world will sustain massive damages, such as the loss of nearly all coral reefs, even if it holds warming to, or just under, 2C. To keep warming to just 1.5C, the carbon tax would have to be even higher, the IMF's Mauro noted, though he said he is not sure how high because the group did not do that analysis.\n\n\u201cThe climate crisis is so dire, and public/popular determination to attack it is suddenly so strong and unquenchable, that even $75 per ton by 2030 seems far too moderate a target,\u201d wrote Charles Komanoff, director of the Carbon Tax Centre, in an emailed response to the IMF study.\n\nThe IMF report considers not just economic policy options, but the political feasibility of these proposals as well, including how they might affect different segments of society and how to make them more politically palatable, such as by redirecting the revenue back to the populace through tax cuts or direct dividend payments.\n\nIt shows that in the G20 largest economies, the tax would raise energy costs by an average of 43% for electricity and 14% for petrol in the countries considered.\n\nThis reflects the growing recognition that policies that impose financial burdens that fall hardest on a particular segment of society could trigger unintended blow back. France's tax hike on gasoline and diesel, for example, helped spur the violent \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests this year.\n\nNoah Kaufman, a research scholar at Columbia's Centre on Global Energy Policy, said the IMF joins \u201cthe chorus of organisations, experts and even grass-roots groups of people\u201d calling for more aggressive climate action.\n\n\u201cThe question is how to spur action, and a group like the IMF has a role to play in making that happen,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "A global agreement to make\u00a0fossil fuel burning more expensive is urgent and the most efficient way of fighting climate change, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) study\u00a0found on Thursday.", "authors": ["Chris Mooney", "Andrew Freedman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/12/ferrybridge-power-station.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
