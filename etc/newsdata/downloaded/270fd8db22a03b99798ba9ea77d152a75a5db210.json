(Picture: Netflix; Getty)\n\nWith the trailer seemingly accidentally uploaded to the Netflix Japan\u2019s YouTube channel for a time, the hype for season 3 of The Crown is definitely building.\n\nThe trailer was uploaded to the Japanese Netflix channel at roughly 10pm their time (2pm Sunday in the UK), but it\u2019s now been pushed back to private, which means that fans who missed out have a little while longer to wait until they get another chance to see it.\n\nTo tide us over until then, and until the November drop date of the new season, we\u2019ve taken a look at whether or not the Royals themselves enjoy the show of which they are the subject matter\u2026\n\nWhat does the Royal Family think of The Crown?\n\nAccording to the Sunday Express in 2017, the Queen herself tuned in to the show after being encouraged to do so by the Earl and Countess of Wessex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA senior source reportedly told the publication: \u2018Edward and Sophie love The Crown. It has been a longstanding arrangement that they drive to Windsor at the weekend to join the Queen for an informal supper while watching TV or a film.\n\nThat\u2019s Queen Olivia Colman to you (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018They have a Netflix account and urged her to watch it with them. Happily, she really liked it, although obviously there were some depictions of events that she found too heavily dramatised.\u2019\n\nHowever, in 2018 the Express reported that a senior courtier said a scene in which Prince Philip (then played by Matt Smith) was portrayed as being unsympathetic to young Prince Charles\u2019 struggles with being bullied at school \u2018annoyed\u2019 the monarch.\n\nThe source said: \u2018The Queen realises that many who watch The Crown take it as an accurate portrayal of the Royal Family and she cannot change that.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018But I can convey that she was upset by the way Prince Philip is depicted as being a father insensitive to his son\u2019s wellbeing.\n\n\u2018She was particularly annoyed at a scene in which Philip has no sympathy for a plainly upset Charles while he is flying him home from Scotland. That simply did not happen.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn top of that, the Queen\u2019s communication secretary, Donal McCabe, wrote to The Guardian in September saying: \u2018Your article (The writer of The Crown reveals he keeps royal household in the picture, 7 September) may have the unfortunate consequence of leading your readers to believe that the television series The Crown is made with some sort of endorsement by the royal household, or an acceptance by the royal household that the drama is factually accurate.\u2019\n\n\u2018We appreciate that readers of the Guardian may enjoy this fictionalised interpretation of historical events but they should do so knowing that the royal household is not complicit in interpretations made by the programme.\u2019\n\nMcCabe goes on to write: \u2018The royal household has never agreed to vet or approve content, has not asked to know what topics will be included, and would never express a view as to the programme\u2019s accuracy.\u2019\n\nThe Crown presents a fictionalised version of the life and times of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nDuring the first two seasons, Claire Foy played the Queen at the start of her reign.\n\nNow, Oscar-winner Olivia Colman has taken the, erm, reigns to play the Queen from 1964 to 1976.\n\nThe Crown season 3 launched 17 November on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
