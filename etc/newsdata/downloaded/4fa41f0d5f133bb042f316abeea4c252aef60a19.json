Also, why is Brad \u2013 the undercover brother \u2013 in it?\n\nAdam\n\nSay g\u2019day to 34-year-old Adam. The self-declared free spirit is a father of two kids from a previous marriage. He\u2019s looking for a partner who would love his kids as much as he does.\n\nAdam\u2019s perfect person is \u201cadventures, funny, and intelligent.\u201d Ya know, just someone he can be best mate\u2019s with.\n\nHe\u2019s also a free-diver, which is very cool. Adam barely has any pictures of just him so here he is with a painting.\n\nAlex\n\nAlex is a 26-year-old landscaper from the Gold Coast. He\u2019s never been in a relationship before, but is 10/10 keen for one.\n\n\u201cMarriage is a big deal to me. I only want to do it once, so I want to 100 per cent make sure it\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nI was gonna share a beach pic, but look at his getup!\n\nCarlin\n\nCarlin is a 30-year-old fitness trainer and an old school romantic from Sydney. He\u2019s heaps keen on spontaneous road trips and all the latest foodie hotspots.\n\nHe also said Angie is \u201cbeautiful, genuine, funny, and seems to have those girl next door qualities.\u201d\n\nCarlin is quite the ~ influencer ~ on Insta. All of his pictures are lovely but I\u2019m going to go with a flanno one. Love a flanno.\n\nCiarran\n\nYou\u2019ve probably already seen a heap of promos with this bloke in it. In his first meeting with Angie, 25-year-old Ciarran described himself as a \u201csexual Willy Wonka.\u201d He\u2019s also the lad that started twerking.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Ciarran scrubbed his Insta clean or he just never posts anything, because he only has 14 pics up.\n\nGlenn\n\n31-year-old Glenn from Perth is just a big ol\u2019 sweetheart looking for love. His perfect person is someone who loves a laugh, is down to earth, intelligent, and can laugh at themselves.\n\nGlenn is absolutely a family/friends bloke. Just look at his Insta.\n\nHaydn\n\n32-year-old Haydn compared himself to Johnny Bravo in his little Q&A with Ten, because he has \u201cimmaculate hair\u201d. Haydn is a firefighter in NSW who \u2013 I don\u2019t know what this means \u2013 \u201cknows a thing or two about breaking hearts\u201d. This is an odd thing to put in a profile.\n\nBut anyway, Haydn sees himself as a \u201ccheeky firefighter who enjoys adventures as much as staying in.\u201d\n\nHaydn doesn\u2019t have that many pictures of himself on Insta, so here\u2019s his official Bachie pic.\n\nJackson\n\nJackson is a 25-year-old lad from NSW, who\u2019s currently juggling his psychological science degree and working at his family\u2019s pie business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rough around the edges and don\u2019t pretend to be perfect.

I also love that she is a rescue dog advocate and is passionate about the welfare of animals.\u201d\n\nJamie hot. Jamie hot. Jamie hot. This is an old pic, but you know, just had to share it.\n\nJess\n\nJess is a local politician who is in love with love. He\u2019s also keen on adventures, and is looking for his \u201cteam mate, someone that can be a friend and lover.\u201d\n\nJess reckons he\u2019s perfect for Angie because he\u2019s also from the Sunshine Coast, laughs a lot, is driven, and knows his purpose in life.\n\n\u201cPlus, I\u2019m passionate in everything I do. And I\u2019m major clucky.\u201d\n\nJess looks a good scooter.\n\nJesse\n\nJesse\u2019s looking for a \u201ccompanion for life, a team mate, someone that can complement me and vice versa.\u201d\n\nJesse just wants to be the best version of himself on the show, and hopes that\u2019s enough to win Angie\u2019s heart.\n\nThe 31-year-old hails from Perth and is incredibly ripped. He also has a pic with Arnold Schwarzenegger on his Insta.\n\nJosh\n\nJosh is the owner of a mobile zoo, and is incredibly passionate about teaching children conservation.\n\nJosh\u2019s perfect partner is someone fun, bubbly, intelligent, and adventurous.\n\nHe\u2019s, uh, the one of the right.

He\u2019s playful as hell, and is looking for someone who can match his fun attitude and positive outlook on life.\n\nI can\u2019t find Kayde\u2019s Instagram and The Bachelorette isn\u2019t following him either/yet so here\u2019s his official portrait.\n\nMatt\n\nMatt\u2019s a 27-year-old BMX stunt rider from Queensland. He\u2019s keen on showing Angie that he\u2019s a \u201cfun-loving person that wants to support everything she has going on and also have her be a part of my exciting life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really believe she would be excited to be around someone like me who would rather get out and have some fun while getting to know each other rather than sit in a fancy restaurant trying to come up with stuff to talk about.\u201d\n\nObservation: Matt\u2019s Q&A is longer than some others\u2026\n\nI know this doesn\u2019t clearly show Matt\u2019s face but DOG.\n\nMitch\n\nAbsolute unit Mitch is a 31-year-old from Queensland. I know I should be talking more about Mitch but I can\u2019t stop laughing at his IG handle.\n\nNiranga\n\nAfter everyone found out there was an undercover brother in the house, Niranga told the camera: \u201cObviously it\u2019s not me, clearly.\u201d And I\u2019m still chuckling about it.\n\nThe 28-year-old Brissy bloke played both state and national rugby and cricket, but is now an aircraft engineer.\n\nNiranga wants someone he \u201ccan have hours of solid banter with.\u201d\n\nIn 10 years, he reckons he\u2019s going to be \u201cmarried (hopefully to Angie if we are a perfect match) and with a few babies.\u201d\n\nOliver\n\n25-year-old Oliver likes to enjoy life and not take things too seriously.\n\nHis ideal partner has a good sense of humour, is always up for a laugh, not a smoker, and likes to enjoy life and not take things too seriously.\n\nScot\n\nNicknamed Scooter by his best mates, Scot is a 27-year-old from Byron Bay. He\u2019s fully done with short-term relationships and is ready to find ~ the one ~.\n\nHis perfect partner is someone who is respectful, driven, grounded, spontaneous, and adventurous. Also, if he had to liken himself to a cartoon character he\u2019d pick Bart Simpson, because he\u2019s mischievous and playful.\n\nTimm\n\nTimm with two Ms! Timm\u2019s the one that brought Angie all those sunflowers.\n\nHere\u2019s what he had to say about Angie:\n\n\u201cAngie seems to tick all the boxes from the couch to the jungle and now the Bachelorette.

She is a little cutie as well.\u201d\n\nBloke.\n\nTom\n\nPresenting 31-year-old Tom from Brisbane.
