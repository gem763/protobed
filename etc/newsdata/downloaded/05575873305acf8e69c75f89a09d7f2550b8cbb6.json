Just in time for when the Christmas rations run out...\n\nWhilst the Creme Egg tub contains 409g of the fondant-filled goodies, the Mini Eggs tin weighs in at a slightly less 319g.\n\n(Image: Cadbury)\n\nIf you were to buy everything separately, a full-size Creme Egg weighs 34g and costs about 50p, or you can get a pack of five for around \u00a31.65.\n\nTherefore, the 409g tub works out at about the same weight as twelve creme eggs, which would cost you \u00a36 - meaning you're getting the same amount of chocolate for your money no matter which option you go for.\n\n(Image: Cadbury)\n\nAs for Mini Eggs, a 90g bag was priced at \u00a31.15 on average this Easter, meaning that a 319g tin is the same weight as three and a half bags of the glorious Easter treat, so you may be losing out on a quid or two by opting for the tin, which costs just under \u00a32 more than the price of three and a half bags of mini eggs.\n\nHowever, there's no word on whether the tubs are filled with full-size or miniature versions of the iconic Easter chocolate, which could change things completely.\n\nAs well as the new tubs, Cadbury will also be selling a Bourneville Easter egg, which features a whole bar of the dark chocolate, weighing 115g and priced at \u00a33.99.", "description": "Cadbury will sell tubs of Creme Eggs and Mini Eggs for Easter - and they'll be on sale right after Christmas", "authors": ["Molly Holt", "Image", "Cadbury"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20670918.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_tubscadbury.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
