These stories have led people to conclude that \u201call the reporting\u201d shows that there is nothing untoward about the Biden relationships in Ukraine, and that the removal of the prosecutor that Joe Biden bragged about on video had wide support and did not originate with him.\n\nWell, of course it did! This isn\u2019t exculpatory. Hunter Biden was invited into his lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company after the Obama administration had worked hard with the European Union and Euromaidan activists in Ukraine to bring down Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s presidency there. Yanukovych would not sign an association agreement with the European Union. Given the way business and politics follow each other in Ukraine, one might reasonably conclude that the new regime in power rewarded its foreign sponsors by allowing aligned oligarchs to give the American vice president\u2019s son a plum position for which he was not qualified. That the European Union agreed with the removal of the prosecutor because he was slow to root out \u201ccorruption\u201d is not a surprise in the least. Once one faction in Ukraine gets into power, it tries to railroad the last regime as criminal. This is why Zelensky keeps emphasizing to Trump that they brought in \u201cnew people\u201d and not the \u201cusual politicians,\u201d that future appointees will be \u201c100 percent my people.\u201d\n\nSo the question that matters is not whether it is a quid pro quo. It is whether the request \u201cto get to the bottom of it,\u201d where \u201cit\u201d refers to issues involving Crowdstrike and the Bidens, is only of private political interest to Donald Trump.", "description": "", "authors": ["M.B.
