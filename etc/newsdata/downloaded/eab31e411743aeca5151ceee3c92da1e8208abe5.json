You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cThe app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimise residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\u201d Apple said in a statement late Wednesday. \u201cThis app violates our guidelines and local laws.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s reversal on the app comes amid the backdrop of intense pressure from the Chinese government on multinational companies to stay out of the continuing protests in Hong Kong. China this week cancelled broadcasts of exhibition NBA games in China after the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted in support of the protests.\n\nApple also removed the app after recently pulling the app of the American news organisation Quartz from the App Store in China. Quartz has been covering the Hong Kong protests.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Apple on Wednesday removed an app that enabled protesters in Hong Kong to track police, a day after facing intense criticism from Chinese state media for it, plunging the technology giant deeper into the increasingly politicised", "authors": ["Jack Nicas"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/08/hong-kong-police-app.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
