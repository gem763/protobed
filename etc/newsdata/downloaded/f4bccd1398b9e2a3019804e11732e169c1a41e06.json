The company\u2019s new Preventive Health tool focuses on getting people information about cancer screenings, heart checkups, and flu vaccines \u2014 all measures that could hopefully help people catch deadly conditions long before they become lethal.\n\nThe tool is simply called Preventive Health, and is now available to Facebook users in the United States. It takes a user\u2019s age and sex from their Facebook profile and provides them with a list of recommended screenings based on those two data points.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re 52 years old,\u201d Freddy Abnousi, Facebook\u2019s head of health care research, tells The Verge. \u201cOne of the things that will come to you \u2014 based on the American Cancer Society\u2019s recommendations \u2014 is that you should have a colorectal cancer screening.\u201d Abnousi says that the app will then give you more information about what kinds of tests are available, from a colonoscopy to a stool test or a CT scan. Abnousi hopes that users will then take what they\u2019ve learned and talk to their primary care physician about what would be best for them. Users can also adjust the age and sex in the tool to get different screening recommendations without having it affect anything on their profile.\n\nThis marks Facebook\u2019s second venture into health-related tools. Its other effort, promoting local blood drives, launched in the United States in June after debuting in India in 2017. Overall, both of these tools mark a far more simple entry into the health space than other tech giants have made. Amazon has been getting into online pharmacies and electronic health records, Apple is monitoring your heartbeat, and Google might be trying to buy Fitbit. In contrast, Facebook\u2019s latest entry is basically enhanced reference pages from official websites mashed together with a calendar reminder, and tailored to broad demographics instead of individuals.\n\nIf you have a primary care physician, they might send you similar reminders every year \u2014 come in to get your pap smear or your cholesterol checked. Facebook\u2019s system is similar, but more generalized, since it\u2019s not connected to any medical records or doctors\u2019 offices.\n\n\u201cWe never see any of your health care stuff,\u201d Abnousi says. \u201cThis is simply taking information, making it understandable, and delivering it to our users and the people across Facebook.\u201d\n\nIn the tool, people can schedule a reminder for their screening, and mark when it\u2019s complete. If they don\u2019t have a primary care physician, they can also look up locations for more affordable \u201cfederally qualified health centers,\u201d where they can talk to a provider about these screenings. (The app will also show where people can get a flu shot during flu season.)\n\nIf you use Preventive Health on Facebook, you can share the tool itself with your network, but not information within it \u2014 for example, Facebook says you won\u2019t be in danger of posting reminders of your mammogram from the tool to your timeline.\n\nOther privacy measures are detailed in announcements of the new tool. In one post, Erin Egan, VP and chief privacy officer of public policy, writes, \u201cWe don\u2019t share personal information about your activity in Preventive Health with third parties, such as health organizations or insurance companies, so it can\u2019t be used for purposes like insurance eligibility.\u201c In another post, Abnousi adds, \u201cWe don\u2019t show ads based on the information you provide in Preventive Health \u2014 that includes things like setting a reminder for a test, marking it as done or searching for a healthcare location.\u201d\n\nA limited group of developers at Facebook will get some limited data about whether people are clicking on the tool at all, and will use that to try to tweak it over the next six months to a year. If it proves popular, then they will consider expanding the effort to more countries, or including more information. About a week after launching in English, Facebook says it will launch a Spanish version.\n\nThe recommendations that appear in the tool were built using information from organizations including the American Heart Association, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Cancer Society, and were reviewed by those organizations for accuracy before being posted to the tool.\n\nAbnousi says that Facebook\u2019s position is: \u201clet\u2019s focus on giving people tools for prevention, from the experts, and hopefully they will drive their own preventive care.\u201d Whether people will actually want to have reminders of their frail and fleeting humanity sandwiched in between chats with friends remains to be seen.", "description": "Starting today, Facebook will let users choose to get personalized reminders about health care tests and vaccines.
