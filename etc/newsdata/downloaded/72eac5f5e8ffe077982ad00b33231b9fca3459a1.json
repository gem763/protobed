A multiethnic choir sang during the mass, wearing T-shirts reading \u201cit is not just about migrants\u201d.\n\nIn his message, Pope Francis said it was \u201cthe poorest of the poor and the most disadvantaged who pay the price\u201d of wars, injustice, economic and social imbalances, both local and global.\n\nHe called on the Roman Catholic Church and the faithful to respond to the challenges of contemporary migration with four words.\n\n\u201cWelcome, protect, promote and integrate,\u201d he said, adding that the church\u2019s mission should also extend to \u201call those living in the existential peripheries\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf we put those four verbs into practice,\u201d the pope told thousands of people, including many migrants, gathered in St Peter\u2019s Square for the special mass, \u201cwe will promote the integral human development of all people.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Soon after his election in 2013, he denounced the \u201cglobalisation of indifference\u201d in a landmark visit to the Mediterranean migrant hub of Lampedusa.\n\nSince the European migrant crisis of 2015, the pontiff has consistently promoted the need to welcome refugees, who he believes have been exploited by nationalists.\n\nIn his address on Sunday, he said that individualism and a utilitarian mentality had produced a \u201cglobalisation of indifference\u201d in which \u201cmigrants, refugees, displaced persons and victims of trafficking have become emblems of exclusion\u201d and are \u201cconsidered the source of all society\u2019s ills\u201d.\n\nHe warned that fear of the unknown, of \u201cmigrants and refugees knocking on our door in search of protection, security and a better future,\u201d could lead to intolerance, closed-mindedness and racism.\n\nHe said the presence of migrants and refugees, and of those considered vulnerable, offered an opportunity \u201cto recover some of those essential dimensions of our Christian existence and our humanity that risk being overlooked in a prosperous society\u201d. In showing concern for migrants, he said, \u201cwe also show concern\u201d for all others.\n\nIt was unclear how long Schmalz\u2019s sculpture would remain in St Peter\u2019s Square. He is perhaps best known for his work depicting Jesus as a homeless person sleeping on a bench, which the pope admired when it was shown at the Vatican during the Jubilee of Mercy in 2016.\n\nThe artist said he was honoured to have a work in St Peter\u2019s Square, describing it as an instrument that could \u201cenforce and celebrate human compassion\u201d.\n\nThe work includes \u201cevery group of persons who has ever travelled,\u201d Schmalz said. At the centre, two angel wings emerge, \u201csuggesting that there could be an angel within any stranger\u201d, he said.\n\nWhen the statue was unveiled, the pope examined it closely, at times patting a figure or two. He also spoke to the artist. When asked about the pope\u2019s comments, Schmalz grinned.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t speak Italian, so I am not sure what he said,\u201d the artist said. \u201cBut he put his hand to his heart and pointed to it. I read that as him saying that he likes it.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Pope Francis has always urged compassion and charity towards the refugees of the world.\u00a0 On Sunday, during a special mass on the\u00a0105th\u00a0World Day of Migrants and Refugees, he unveiled a monument to migration in St Peter\u2019s Square as an homage to the displaced.", "authors": ["Elisabetta Povoledo"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/30/08/pope-francis-migrant-statue.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
