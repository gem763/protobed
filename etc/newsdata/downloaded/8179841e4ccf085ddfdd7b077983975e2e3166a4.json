The noise was intense and long-lasting, a wave of negativity that washed up to the Major League Baseball suite where the president was watching the final game of the Series to be held at Nationals Park.\n\nBut the moment the big screen in center field switched from showing Trump to once again showing the veterans, the boos from the crowd immediately returned to cheers.\n\nThis was a crowd that knew exactly what it was doing. And it knew it even before the game began.\n\nSpectators telegraphed how they would greet Trump when they welcomed renowned chef and vocal Trump critic Jose Andres, who threw out the game\u2019s honorary first pitch, with a particularly raucous standing ovation.\n\nI bumped into Andres in the press elevator an hour and a half after his pitch and asked him if he interpreted the crowd\u2019s reaction as a statement supporting his activism against Trump.\n\nHe said he would prefer not to comment, except to say this: \u201cI\u2019m an immigrant. Today we celebrate immigrants on a field full of immigrants.\u201d\n\nRan into Trump critic Jose Andres, who got a raucous standing ovation for his first pitch, in the elevator heading back to press box. \u201cToday we celebrate immigrants on a field full of immigrants,\u201d he told me. He waved goodbye as Nats owner Mark Lerner happened to be in the lobby. pic.twitter.com/qCLpZagNFh \u2014 Christine Brennan (@cbrennansports) October 28, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s visit made many people uncomfortable. He did not sit with the principal owners of the Nationals, the Lerner family, in their suite. Word was the Lerners didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with him during his visit, a source who asked not to be named but was familiar with the situation told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe president arrived after the start of Sunday night\u2019s game because he didn\u2019t want to become a disruption for the thousands of fans streaming to Nats Park. But he was disruptive nonetheless. He caused extra long security lines for fans entering the stadium, as any president does, and a portion of the main concourse was closed for several minutes for his entrance and exit from the game.\n\nHELLO: Trump booed at Game 5 of World Series\n\nSECURITY DOGS: Strasburg jokes about security for Trump's visit\n\nIn addition to the robust booing thousands directed at Trump, fans exercised their right to freedom of speech in another way.\n\nAs the fourth inning began, hundreds lustily chanted \u201cLock him up\u201d at Trump, mimicking the omnipresent chants Trump supporters directed at Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\u201cLock him up\u201d broke out in the outfield seats and in the upper deck. It lingered for several minutes before fans returned their focus to the action on the field.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t attended a major league baseball game since he took office in January 2017.\n\nOdds are, he won\u2019t come back any time soon.", "description": "President Trump attended Game 5 and was met by a torrent boos.
