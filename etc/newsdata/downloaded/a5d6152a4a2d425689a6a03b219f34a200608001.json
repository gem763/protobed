We're not a comprehensive toy-unboxing site by any stretch, but we couldn't skip this opportunity to marvel at a handsome statue of Ragnaros, one of the original WoW's most memorable raid bosses.\n\nThe above gallery breaks down everything else in the box set (which has since sold out at Blizzard's official site). In good news for anybody who missed the box's sale but still harbors a WoW addiction, there's not much in the way of exclusive in-game items or any DLC tie-ins with other Blizzard games.\n\nYou may feel differently if you're obsessed with fetching rare mounts for your journeys across Azeroth and neighboring fantasy lands, as this set does include two mounts (one for Horde, one for Alliance). Otherwise, this is a set for the series' biggest toy-collecting fans, not a way to pick up expansion packs or other crucial in-game content. Be warned: those mounts only work with the modern version of WoW, not WoW Classic.\n\nThe box set starts shipping this week for anyone who successfully preordered it earlier this year.\n\nListing image by Sam Machkovech", "description": "15 years later, Ragnaros statue benefits from a few more \"pixels\" worth of geometry.", "authors": ["Sam Machkovech"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_0275-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
