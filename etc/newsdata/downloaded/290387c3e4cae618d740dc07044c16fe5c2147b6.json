The Beer Growler touts the same dependable construction as the rest of the Hydroflask lineup, but we'll give you a detailed run down in the event that you forgot (also we just like talking about it anyway).\n\nThis newly updated Growler features Fresh Carry System which is designed to keep beer cold and carbonated for multiple hours, though, there's a fair chance the beer won't be there longer than an hour. Additionally, the Fresh Carry System touts a leak-proof seal and improved temperature control, meaning your choice in frothy beverage stays refreshing every time you go back for more.

The Growler is outfitted with TempShield protection, meaning you don't sacrifice the integrity of your precious paws for frosty or hot beverages.", "description": "Buy the Hydro Flask 64oz Growler online or shop all  from Backcountry.com.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://content.backcountry.com/images/items/large/HYF/HYF001H/GRA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-30"}
