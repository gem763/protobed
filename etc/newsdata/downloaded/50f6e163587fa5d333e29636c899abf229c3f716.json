He said he was in there for about 20 seconds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He saw what looked like a tyre at the bottom so he put his foot on that to push him up a bit. Luckily his two friends and a passer by pulled him out, my son can\u2019t swim.\u2019\n\nThe mother-of-two, who lives in Darlaston, said when her son was \u2018soaked\u2019 when he arrived home.\n\nShe continued: \u2018I thought he was joking when he first told me. It gave him such a shock, it has left us all feeling shocked about what happened.\n\n\u2018This could happen to anyone, something needs to be done \u2013 or are they waiting for someone to fall in and die. I just thank God he came out with the help of friends and a passer by. It\u2019s horrible thinking about what could have happened.\u2019\n\nIt appears to be covered in grass (Picture: BPM Media)\n\nThe teen\u2019s fall would have happened a matter of minutes before Steve Worthington and his 11-year-old son, Lewis, stepped straight into the water \u2013 also believing the weeds were grass .\n\nThe 41-year-old had to battle to keep his lad\u2019s head above the water as they desperately tried to clamber to safety.\n\n\u2018We just stepped straight in and went straight under the water,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018We have never been down there and we couldn\u2019t see any warning signs in place. The whole area is thick green weeds \u2013 it looks just like grass.\n\nA spokesman for the Canal & River Trust, which oversees the waterway near to the site, said: \u2018We are aware that there is a problem with an overgrowth of weed in the basin, which can make it seem as though the area is covered in thick grass, hiding the water underneath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Safety signs have been installed at the basin warning people of the danger. Removing the weed is an ongoing battle and there will be a team from Canal & River Trust out in the basin to clear sections of the weed in the next few days.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
