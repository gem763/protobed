This is not persuasive or helpful.\n\n\u201cIncitement and threats are not free speech.\u201d\n\nWhile technically true, not everything that might colloquially be called a \u201cthreat\u201d is outside the protection of the First Amendment. Only \u201ctrue threats\u201d are unprotected\u2014threats conveying \u201ca serious expression of intent to an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.\u201d There\u2019s some ambiguity about whether evaluating the seriousness of a threat is an objective question, or a subjective question, or both, something the Supreme Court recently failed to resolve. But most courts impose an objective test: A threat is \u201ctrue\u201d if a reasonable person hearing it would take it as a sincere expression of intent to do harm. That doesn\u2019t cover most hyperbole and political invective.\n\nWe\u2019re free, moreover, to attack the law, argue that breaking it is moral, and urge our fellow citizens to break it. We can even assert that violence is justified. Such advocacy is only unprotected when it is \u201cdirected to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\u201d Imminent is the key word here. Saying \u201cGo beat up those protesters over there\u201d probably qualifies; ugly rhetoric in general does not.\n\n\u201cFighting words are not free speech.\u201d\n\nPeople in favor of restrictions on ugly speech often point to the \u201cfighting words\u201d doctrine\u2014the idea, taken from the 1942 case Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, that the government can punish words \u201cwhich, by their very utterance, inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u201d This argument ignores the past 80 years of First Amendment cases, which have dramatically narrowed the doctrine to the point that many commentators question whether it still survives. At most, the doctrine allows the government to punish face-to-face insults likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction from the particular person addressed.\n\nRead: Trump\u2019s redundant executive order on campus speech\n\nFurthermore, like invoking \u201c\u2019Fire!\u2019 in a crowded theater,\u201d dropping \u201cfighting words\u201d reveals a tin ear for history. As a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, Walter Chaplinsky (of Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire) was a member of a religious minority subject to shocking abuse and injustice in the 1930s and \u201940s. He was preaching on a street corner when a mob assaulted him; one man tried to impale him on a pole bearing the American flag. Police officers led him away rather than arresting his attackers, provoking him to call them fascists. For that offense he was prosecuted. So when you cite the fighting-words doctrine to urge punishment of bigotry, you\u2019re relying on a doctrine built on the subjugation of religious minorities. Mind the irony.\n\n\u201cHate speech is not free speech.\u201d\n\nThere is an admirable growing social consensus that it\u2019s despicable to denigrate people based on ethnicity, religion, or sexuality. But most despicable speech is protected by the First Amendment. Contrary to the popular slogan, there is no hate-speech exception to the First Amendment. Particular examples of hateful speech may satisfy the established tests for the true-threats or incitement exceptions, but they\u2019re not unprotected just because they\u2019re hateful.\n\n\u201cStochastic terrorism is not free speech.\u201d\n\nIn the past few months you may have heard the term stochastic terrorism to describe speech that, according to some advocates, whips up hatred against groups and leads unbalanced people to commit violence against them, even if it doesn\u2019t explicitly call for violence. By definition, if stochastic terrorism doesn\u2019t call for violence, it doesn\u2019t fall outside the First Amendment, because it\u2019s not intended and likely to lead to imminent lawless action. It may be morally reprehensible, but, just like hate speech, it\u2019s protected.\n\n\u201cWe must balance free speech with [social good].\u201d / \u201cThere is a line between free speech and [social evil].\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s common, in free-speech debates, to find people arguing that America must balance free speech and safety, or free speech and the right to be free of abuse. A related rhetorical trope is \u201cline drawing\u201d: the idea that we must draw lines between free speech and abusive speech.", "description": "Most speech, hateful or not, is protected by the Constitution.
