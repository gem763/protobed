I did not say anything because I did not want to anger him more.'\n\nThe recruit didn't require medical attention for the staple injury. He was carrying the staple gun to fasten paper targets to the driving range.\n\nThe Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego is getting scrutinized for how the drill instructor's handle their recruits (FILE IMAGE)\n\nThe same drill instructor also allegedly ordered a recruit to part of a pine cone during a hike, but the recruit initially kept quiet because he that was just part of the boot camp experience.\n\nComplainants reportedly questioned the instructor's sobriety to senior officers.\n\nThe Marine officer who investigated the abuse said it 'makes sense' that the drill instructor's sobriety was questioned. However they were not able to find enough evidence to prove he was intoxicated.\n\nBut the officer did write that the instructor was going through personal issues, including a divorce and an injury requiring pain medication, the Washington Post said. He recommended the drill instructor be court-martialed for charges of cruelty and maltreatment, among others.\n\nThe Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, where at least 20 Marine recruits claim abuse. One enlistee said he was forced to eat a pine cone during a hike\n\nGetting into shape at the San Diego Marine Recruit Depot in San Diego, where a bombshell report alleges abuse by drill instructors, including taking a stapler to a recruit's stomach\n\n'Given his actions with these recruits \u2026 there would likely be additional allegations of recruit maltreatment' if further investigated, the investigator determined.\n\nBut the Marines opted against a court-martial, and the instructor was instead reprimanded administratively, keeping the case out of the public.\n\nHe received a formal reprimand, a demotion in rank, loss of two months of pay and permanently removed as a drill instructor, the Post said. He left the service in September 2018.\n\nThe Marines said in a statement, 'The individual was held accountable for their actions, which were starkly incongruent to a Marine leader responsible for training recruits and Marines.'\n\nOfficials in San Diego said in a statement that Marine Corps recruit training is 'challenging for recruits and staff alike,' and that each drill instructor undergoes thousands of hours of training and assessment, the Post reported.\n\nRaheel Siddiqui, a Marine recruit who died after falling 40-feet to death while trying to get away from his drill instructor in 2016\n\nA Marine recruit at the firing range, supervised by his drill instructor at Camp Pendleton, California in Sept. 2019 (FILE IMAGE)\n\nOther complaints include a sergeant who in 2017 worked around recruits as a military instructor and member of the Weapons and Field Training Battalion, and was reported for misconduct that included assault and using racist terms.\n\nIn one instance, he allegedly kicked a recruit. In another, the sergeant asked a recruit who appeared to be of Middle Eastern descent whether he was a terrorist.\n\nThe complaints echoed verbal abuse that preceded the death of Private Raheel Siddiqui at Parris Island just a few months prior.\n\nSiddiqui fell 40 feet to his death while running away from a drill instructor who had targeted him.\n\nThat incident led to a 10-year prison sentence for one individual and internal punishment for a handful of others.\n\nThe Marines have attempted to readdress training for drill instructors, with a special emphasis on preventing hazing and abuse.", "description": "At least 20 Marines have been disciplined for misconduct at a recruit training center in San Diego since 2017.
