Rand Paul (R-KY) on Monday praised President Donald Trump for his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, stating the move shows the president continues to fulfill his \u201cpromises\u201d to end \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stand with @realDonaldTrump today as he once again fulfills his promises to stop our endless wars and have a true America First foreign policy,\u201d Paul, a libertarian who has long opposed intervention abroad, wrote on Twitter.\n\nI stand with @realDonaldTrump today as he once again fulfills his promises to stop our endless wars and have a true America First foreign policy. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) October 7, 2019\n\nPaul\u2019s praise comes as neoconservative Republicans are expressing disapproval with President Trump\u2019s decision. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a staunch defender of the president, called the pullout \u201cunnerving to its core.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis impulsive decision by the president has undone all the gains we\u2019ve made, thrown the region into further chaos, Iran is licking their chops, and if I\u2019m an ISIS fighter, I\u2019ve got a second lease on life,\u201d Graham told Fox and Friends. \u201cI will do everything I can to sanction Turkey\u2019s military and their economy if they step one foot into Syria.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley also criticized the decision, tweeting: \u201cWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back. The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend.\u201d\n\nHaley\u2019s comments come after the former U.S. diplomat praised President Trump\u2019s foreign policy record as something \u201cevery American should be proud of.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look around the world, President Trump has a record every American should be proud of. In the Middle East, the ISIS caliphate has been destroyed, and we\u2019ve stopped handing billions in cash to Iran that it used to fund terrorism,\u201d she told Fox News ahead of a Sunday fundraiser for the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign. \u201cThe North Korean regime is no longer testing long-range missiles. America is once again treating the Cuban dictatorship like the pariah it is, and Maduro\u2019s days are numbered in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThe White House on Sunday announced it will remove U.S troops from northern Syria ahead of a Turkish military mission to remove Kurdish forces from the area.\n\n\u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria,\u201d read the statement. \u201cThe United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u2018Caliphate,\u2019 will no longer be in the immediate area.\u201d\n\nIn a series of Monday tweets, President Trump defended his decision, saying \u201cthe Kurds fought with us,\u201d and they \u201cwere paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u201d the president wrote.\n\n\u201cWE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Trump also warned that the U.S. will \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it wages missions considered \u201coff limits\u201d in the region.", "description": "Sen.
