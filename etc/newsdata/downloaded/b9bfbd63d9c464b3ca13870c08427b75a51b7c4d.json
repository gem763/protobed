NRL star Daniel Vidot (pictured) - who famously quit to join WWE - has returned to Australia on a mission to convince more of Australia's top NRL and AFL stars to join him in the WWE\n\n'Let's just say Sammy Thaiday would have been awesome if he was a bit younger,' he said.\n\n'Personalities like that mate, that's all I'm looking for. I have a couple more [players] up my sleeve but you guys will just have to wait to find out.'\n\nDaniel was a winger in the NRL for nine years, lending his services to the Canberra Raiders, St. George Illawarra Dragons and the Brisbane Broncos.\n\nHe gave it all away in 2017, shocking the sporting world just months later by signing a developmental deal with WWE's NXT promotion.\n\nJoin the club: 'I'm on the lookout for people with bubbly, larger than life personalities,' Daniel told Daily Mail Australia, before revealing the State Of Origin great he would love to see in the ring\n\n'It's been an awesome transition, mate. Rugby players are almost made for it,' he said of his new in-ring career.\n\nThe transition went so well that it only took four-months of training before he was ready for his first match.\n\n'I've had lots of positive feedback. That's the reason the WWE want more rugby players,' Daniel said.\n\nBig Sammy! 'Let's just say Sammy Thaiday would have been awesome if he was a bit younger,' he revealed\n\n'I took the risk to travel a path that hasn't been taken before and now I've created a new path to allow athletes from Australia and New Zealand to come across and give it a crack.'\n\nThe Brisbane-born star was flown in to find both men and women who have what it takes to be a wrestler.\n\nHe describes the job as 'sport and entertainment joined together.'\n\nBeau knows wrestling? A WWE career would also clearly suit the likes of Beau Ryan (pictured) Jonathan Thurston and other recently-retired stars who can handle a live mic as well as they can handle a live ball\n\nSuch a role would clearly suit the likes of Beau Ryan, Jonathan Thurston and other recently-retired stars who can handle a live mic as well as they can handle a live ball.\n\nWhile the two professions may seem like polar opposites, Daniel explained that rugby players have only a few - rather significant - adjustments to make.\n\n'A massive positive that comes with our sport is that we're so gifted with certain athleticism and we're able to be very coachable in what we do,' he said.\n\nNot so hard? Daniel (pictured in his NRL playing days) said making the change to WWE wasn't as hard as he thought it would be, although 'the fitness side of things is very different'\n\n'And definitely the fitness side of things is very different - I'm used to 40-minute halves with no breaks and when I did my first five-minute match, I was blowing [tired]!\n\n'It's like being in a car crash twenty times a week, that's what your body feels like you're getting thrown around, smacked, you're hitting the ropes, your back's bleeding, just stuff like that.\n\nDaniel's big goal for 2020 is to make it onto NXT TV - a goal he's confident he will achieve, thanks in part to advice he received from Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.\n\nKeep up! 'I'm used to 40-minute halves with no breaks and when I did my first five-minute match, I was blowing [tired]! Wrestling is like being in a car crash twenty times a week, that's what your body feels like' he explained\n\n'He basically told me \"you'll get there. Just put in the hard work and you'll get there.\"'\n\n'And obviously being one of my idols growing up, that's stuck in my mind and it's only made me hungrier.\n\n'You see all these guys on TV as a kid and yeah, now that I'm here I have to pinch my face a couple times just to make sure it's real.\n\nDaniel is part of the WWE Live tour coming to Sydney's Qudos Bank Arena on Monday, before heading to Brisbane on Tuesday and Melbourne on Wednesday.\n\n'You'll get there. Just put in the hard work and you'll get there': Daniel's already been rubbing shoulders with the likes of Dwayne The Rock Johnson, who gave him a simple piece of advice he'll never forget\n\nHe remained tight-lipped on a rumoured 'massive surprise' in store for the main event.\n\n'I can't give that away actually but I do know what's happening and you definitely don't want to miss it. You've got to watch it.\n\n'I might even make an appearance in some way as well'.\n\nTickets to WWE Live Australia are available via Ticketek.\n\nSee him live: Daniel is part of the WWE Live tour coming to Sydney's Qudos Bank Arena on Monday, before heading to Brisbane on Tuesday and Melbourne on Wednesday\n\n\n\n", "description": "NRL star Daniel Vidot famously quit Rugby League to pursue a career in the flamboyant world of professional wrestling.", "authors": ["Alex Michael For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/07/19872156-0-image-a-19_1571379623960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
