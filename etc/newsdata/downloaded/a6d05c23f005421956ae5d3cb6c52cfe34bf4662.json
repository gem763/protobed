She went on to receive a $100,000 settlement following the alleged incident.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The New York Times on Sunday published one memo featured in the book that reveals Bloom constructed a six-point plan to damage McGowan\u2019s reputation in December 2016.\n\n\u201cI feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them.\u201d Bloom wrote. \u201cWe can place an article re her becoming increasingly unglued, so that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she\u2019s discredited.\u201d\n\nMcGowan called for Bloom and Boies to be disbarred, telling Variety: \u201cWhat these people have done to my standing in the world has been systematic \u2013 it\u2019s been evil. It\u2019s one of the worst cases of gaslighting I\u2019ve ever heard, and it\u2019s starring me.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
