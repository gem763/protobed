The announcement comes exactly one month after it initially leaked, when Google\u2019s paper was accidentally published early. Now, however, it\u2019s official, meaning the full details of the research are public, and the broader scientific community can fully scrutinize what Google says it\u2019s achieved.\n\nGoogle says that its 54-qubit Sycamore processor was able to perform a calculation in 200 seconds that would have taken the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputer 10,000 years. That would mean the calculation, which involved generated random numbers, is essentially impossible on a traditional, non-quantum computer.\n\nUnsurprisingly, IBM, the company that operates the supercomputer that Google claims to have beaten, and a key quantum computer competitor, is disputing Google\u2019s claims. In a blog post published pre-emptively on Monday, the company said that the same task could be performed on a classical system in just 2.5 days, rather than the 10,000 years that Google is claiming. IBM says that Google \u201cfailed to fully account for plentiful disk storage\u201d when estimating how long its traditional supercomputer would take to perform the calculation.\n\nDespite IBM\u2019s attempts to downplay Google\u2019s achievement, many in the research community welcomed the news, with scientists quoted by The New York Times likening Google\u2019s breakthrough to the Wright brothers\u2019 first plane flight in 1903. We may still be years away from having quantum computers that are useful for practical tasks, but Google\u2019s findings could finally have provided proof that such a future is possible in the first place.", "description": "Google has officially announced that it\u2019s achieved quantum supremacy.
