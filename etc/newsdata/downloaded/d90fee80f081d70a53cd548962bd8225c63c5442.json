Morgan, Donald Carducci, said the jackpot needs to now be at least $70.5million to excite players.\n\nA $40million jackpot is now considered too small of a prize for Australian lotto players\n\nMr Carducci says 'FOMO', otherwise known as fear of missing out, contributes to an increase of ticket sales during multi-million dollar jackpots.\n\nBut players are becoming less likely to buy a lottery ticket in the long term if the prize remains stagnant.\n\nInstead, record-breaking jackpots such as September's $150million draw, trigger FOMO in Australians to participate in the draw again.\n\n'Record-breaking jackpots significantly move the FOMO point higher, requiring increasingly larger prizes to lure non-frequent players to purchase tickets,' he said.\n\n'While there was an increase in ticket sales for larger jackpots, this was not enough to compensate for the decrease in sales for lower-mid size jackpots due to jackpot fatigue.'\n\nMr Carducci told the Sydney Morning Herald he expects Tabcorp lottery ticket sales to be nearly 20 per cent higher this year.\n\nBut he predicts sales will fall by about seven per cent in 2020 as players lose their enthusiasm again and are looking to be enticed by a higher prize up for grabs.", "description": "Australians have become increasingly uninspired to buy lottery tickets due to 'jackpot fatigue'.", "authors": ["Paula Ahillon For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/06/19428690-0-image-a-45_1570513694655.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
