The JV will have the capability to price and manage complex insurance products with embedded market and actuarial risks, on a global basis. It will serve as a turnkey solution for financial modelling and enterprise risk management to provide comprehensive economic solutions to life insurance companies.\n\nIn connection with the launch of the JV, V\u00e4rde Partners is seeking initially to invest $500 million in complex life insurance, annuity, and reinsurance assets that will be supported by the JV. This is part of V\u00e4rde\u2019s intention to broaden its investing in targeted sub-sectors of the financial services industry, marking the expansion of its private equity strategy into insurance.\n\nElena Lieskovska, Partner and Head of European Financial Services at V\u00e4rde Partners, said:\n\n\u201cGiven the current landscape of historically low interest rates and fundamental regulatory and accounting changes, we believe the opportunity across the $23 trillion life insurance industry is huge. Life insurance companies are increasingly seeking risk mitigation solutions for legacy blocks of liabilities with multi-dimensional risks. This is particularly true for complex annuity products, such as those with high guarantees or exposure to certain market risks, which typically attract a higher capital charge. We are excited to expand V\u00e4rde\u2019s financial services footprint into insurance, and partner with Agam to provide alternative solutions to the industry.\u201d\n\nAgam\u2019s Co-Founders, Avi Katz and Chak Raghunathan said:\n\n\u201cThe need for multi-dimensional solutions to the complex changes facing the life insurance industry has never been greater. Against this backdrop, we believe the combination of V\u00e4rde Partner\u2019s core strengths in complex transactions together with Agam\u2019s differentiated pALM platform will create a world-class insurance solutions provider. In particular, the Agam platform is designed to price, analyze and manage complex insurance products with embedded capital market risks and offers creative structures and solutions on a global basis.\u201d\n\nAgam\u2019s highly scalable, proprietary technology platform applies machine learning, predictive data analytics and cloud computing to evaluate and assess complex insurance liabilities. Its innovative approach incorporates advanced analytical techniques, including integrating transaction modelling with actuarial cash flows.\n\nAbout V\u00e4rde Partners\n\nV\u00e4rde Partners is a $14 billion global alternative investment firm that employs a value-based approach to investing across a broad array of geographies, segments and asset types, including corporate and traded credit, real estate, mortgages, financial services, real assets and infrastructure.
