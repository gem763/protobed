I was only 20 and in my first year of university and I didn\u2019t know what they were going to find.\n\n\u2018That was after about five or six years back and forth to my GP.\n\n\u2018I started my periods when I was 11 and they were always heavier than usual and made me feel quite sick.\n\n\u2018When I got into my teenage years, my GP palmed it off as a \u2018heavy period\u2019 and said \u2018unfortunately that is part of being a woman.\n\n\u2018They never mentioned I could have this condition until they decided to refer me to a gynaecologist at 19.\u2019\n\nJoanne described her condition as \u2018one of the loneliest diseases\u2019 and said she is determined to help others speak about it and about their periods in a bid to raise awareness.\n\nShe said: \u2018It can be one of the loneliest diseases because it is not spoken about as it is quite personal.\n\n\u2018If you break your leg, people ring up to ask how you are and you can talk about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But with endometriosis, if somebody rings and asks how you are, you don\u2019t want to say \u2018my vagina is really bad at the moment.\u2019\n\n\u2018We talk about periods but not in a way we should and it is only just becoming more acceptable.\n\n\u2018It takes a while to explain what endometriosis is but I am on a mission to make it more normal to talk about.\u2019\n\nJoanne, who has stage four endometriosis, will start on a monthly Zoladex injection which will put her into early menopause.\n\nEstrogen fuels the growth of endometriosis lesions so dwindling estrogen levels at menopause should lessen her symptoms.\n\nShe added: \u2018It\u2019s not normal to have to take time off of work, school or university because of a period.\n\n\u2018A period does hurt, but usually paracetamol and Ibuprofen can normally ease the pain.\n\n\u2018When you feel it isn\u2019t normal that\u2019s when you should see your GP.\n\n\u2018People say its hereditary but no one in my family has had it. It could be lying dormant and could spread at any time.\u2019\n\nJoanne has now set up a Facebook support group for endometriosis sufferers in Kent and has had more than 170 people join since it launched last month.\n\nShe said: \u2018I set it up to help support as many women as possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I was searching to see if I could find any local groups on Facebook but there wasn\u2019t, so I thought I would give it a go and set up my own. It has done really well so far.\u2019\n\nMORE: Woman says a vegan diet has cured her severe psoriasis\n\nMORE: The UK\u2019s \u2018naughtiest\u2019 children\u2019s names revealed\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A mum suffering from endometriosis will be forced into the menopause at the age of 30, and may also face having her womb removed.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91162594_1571746696.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
