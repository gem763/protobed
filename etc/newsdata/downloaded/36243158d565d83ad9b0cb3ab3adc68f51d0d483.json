There was multiple parties who had to contribute to the deal which finally then did not succeed.\"\n\nMr Fankhauser said, on reflection, he will \"consider what is right but I'm not going to decide that today\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Fomer Thomas Cook staff back at work\n\nMs Reeves asked the former chief executive of Thomas Cook why he held on so long for a financing deal to save the company which he \"knew was never going to happen\"?\n\nMr Fankhauser said he was \"confident\" it was going to happen: \"Otherwise I would not have tried so hard and I had the backing from the banks and I had the substantive agreement on 28 August from the banks and the bondholders.\"\n\nHe told MPs that he met with transport secretary Grant Shapps on 9 September and claimed that if the government had backed Thomas Cook's rescue plan, the travel operator would have survived.\n\n\"We made an estimate how much could the collapse of Thomas cook cost, that was far higher than what we requested,\" he said, but added \"I honestly don't dare to criticise the government.\n\n\"I firmly believe that after the recapitalisation... we would have had a new start\".\n\nIn the end, he said, the government did not want to set a precedent.\n\n\"I was awfully sad,\" Mr Fankhauser. \"I knew I would have to throw in the towel\".\n\nLast week, Sunderland-based firm Hays Travel announced that it would take over 555 Thomas Cook shops, in a deal that could potentially save 2,500 jobs.\n\nMr Fankhauser said the announcement was \"honestly one of the bright days in the last three weeks\".", "description": "Peter Fankhauser says he was not solely at fault for the firm's collapse but will reconsider the reward.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07r2nh6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
