(Photo: L.L.Bean / Wildluvs)\n\n\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nIt may only be October, but it's never too early to start your holiday shopping\u2014especially if you know something is going to sell out. Yes, shopping for someone else is stressful, but it's even more stressful when the perfect gift you planned is out of stock. Although you can wait for Black Friday for better deals on products, you probably don't want to risk products like Hatchimals, Instant Pots, and Bean Boots selling out before you can get one. Here are 15 popular gifts that will sell out soon.\n\n1. The coveted Instant Pot\n\nThe Instant Pot almost always sells out on Black Friday. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nFor years now, the Instant Pot has been on the top of everyone's wishlist. The popularity of this electric multi-cooker has been soaring thanks to its incredible versatility and pressure cooking setting. We've seen the Instant Pot Duo, the most popular model, sell out consistently during Black Friday, and we're expecting the same this year. If you want to beat the rush, we highly recommend getting it early. Plus, you can score it for $20 off at Amazon right now.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Duo 6-Quart Pressure Cooker at Amazon for $79\n\n2. Bean Boots with a limited stock\n\nSurvive the winter with these cult-favorite boots while they're still in stock. (Photo: L.L. Bean)\n\nIn snowy or rainy weather, Bean Boots are the No.1 thing you'll see on most New Englanders' feet. If you were planning to gift these cult-favorite boots, I would purchase them sooner than later. Since they're handcrafted in L.L.Bean's factory in Maine, there's very limited stock on Bean Boots and they go on backorder during the holiday season. When my parents tried to gift me a pair a few years ago, they didn't ship until early-February. Don't make the same mistake and order these duck boots well in advance.\n\n3. A popular, growing llama toy\n\nTickle me Elmo has nothing on this guy. (Photo: Hatchimals)\n\nIf your kid is asking for one of the hottest toys on the market, get it now\u2014or it will sell out. Our parenting editor says that one of the most popular toys of 2019 is the Hatchimals Wow Llalacorn. This silly-looking llama-unicorn hybrid can hatch and re-hatch all over again and can grow up to 2 1/2 feet tall. It also comes with 250 different reactions, sounds, motions, and more. If you're smart, you'll grab it now before it becomes impossible to hatch when the holiday shopping season really starts.\n\nGet the Hatchimals Wow Llalacorn at Amazon for $67\n\n4. The latest Apple Watch model\n\nGet the most popular smart watch while it's still available. (Photo: Apple)\n\nWhen the Apple Watch Series 5 was announced in September, we already knew it was going to be a popular gift in 2019. We already love the Series 4, but the Series 5 has been upgraded with a larger screen, always-on retina display, and emergency services calling, making it even better. Last Black Friday, we saw certain sizes and band colors of the Series 4 sell out, so we can expect the same with the Series 5.\n\n5. The most affordable Echo\n\nThis modest Echo is at an insanely low price right now. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThe Dot may be the most modest of the Amazon Echo lineup, but it's still a great entry-level smart speaker. It's a great gift for anyone who wants to dabble in smart home technology, but it might sell out sooner than you think. Right now, Amazon is running a deal to get the Dot with one month of Amazon Music Unlimited for just $10.98. This is presumably to make way for the newer model, which comes with an LED clock display, to be released this November. But if you wait too long, you'll miss out on this deal and will have to pay market price for the newer Dot when the older generation is sold out.\n\nGet the Amazon Echo Dot (3rd gen.) with 1 month of Amazon Music Unlimited at Amazon for $10.98\n\n6. A popular smart TV with Roku built-in\n\nGive the gift of a great TV at a reasonable price. (Photo: Reviewed / Lee Neikirk)\n\nIf you want to gift a TV to your loved ones this year, we recommend going with a TCL Series 6, which has built-in Roku and great picture quality. According to our TV editor, getting a 65-inch Roku TV for $999 is already a great value, but this one also has great performance. Everyone but the pickiest viewers (you know, the one who keeps asking for an OLED) is going to absolutely love it. It's already been selling out at retailers like Amazon and Target, but you can still snag one at Walmart.\n\nGet the TCL 65R617 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Roku Smart LED TV at Walmart for $999\n\n7. A cult-favorite egg cooker\n\nThis egg cooker will solve your recipient's breakfast woes. (Photo: Dash)\n\nPoached, soft boiled, scrambled, hard boiled\u2014eggs can be a challenge to get just right. That's why people are obsessed with this egg cooker from Dash. It cooks your eggs any style and gets them right every time (as long as you follow the directions). Warning: When this product drops in price, it typically sells out, so you're better off getting it now for your breakfast-challenged recipient. Plus, it's only $20, so it's not too much of a splurge.\n\nGet the Dash Rapid Egg Cooker at Amazon for $19.99\n\n8. The hottest toy of the season\n\nThis adorable elephant will be at the top of every kid's wishlist. (Photo: Wildluvs)\n\nWhen it comes to deciding what they want for the holidays, kids tend to pick the toys they've been seeing the most. Juno My Baby Elephant has been heavily advertised this year\u2014a.k.a. it will be on the top of every kid's wishlist. It also means that it's more likely to sell out. This interactive elephant has an animated trunk that will respond to your child's touch. They'll have fun playing games and getting her to come out of her shy shell over time.\n\nGet the Wildluvs Juno My Baby Elephant at Amazon for $77\n\n9. A hair styler that doesn't use heat\n\nThis innovative styler has sold out before and probably will again. (Photo: Dyson)\n\nDesigned to use air instead of heat, the Dyson Airwrap Styler will style and dry simultaneously, using steam instead of heat to curl strands. It became a hot hair product when it launched in October 2018\u2014so much so that it immediately sold out and had a 133,000-person waitlist. It's finally back in stock at Sephora, but we can expect this hot styling tool not to be on the market for long. So get it while you can to give your recipient the gift of frizz- and damage-free ringlets or waves.\n\nGet the Dyson Airwrap Styler at Sephora for $549\n\n10. Monogrammed mugs for a personalized cup of joe\n\nNothing says \"mine\" like a cup with your initial on it. (Photo: Anthropologie)\n\nMonogrammed mugs make a great personalized gift, especially if your giftee is constantly sipping on tea or coffee. I mean, nothing says \"mine\" like a mug with your initial on it. The classic monogrammed mug and diner-styled tile mug have been popular on Anthropologie year after year. But if your recipient has a common moniker, the letter you wanted to give them could be sold out by the end of the holiday season.\n\n11. A new version of the popular Nintendo Switch\n\nThis more affordable version of the Nintendo Switch will be flying off the shelves this season. (Photo: Nintendo)\n\nIf we learned anything from how fast Nintendo Switches sold when they were first released, it's that it will probably happen again with the newest Nintendo console. The Nintendo Switch Lite is the smaller, cheaper, more portable alternative that's ideal for handheld gaming. With new games like Animal Crossing and Link's Awakening, it's going to be one of the hottest consoles come Black Friday, so get it now so you're not scrambling to find it at an increased price once it's out of stock.\n\nGet the Nintendo Switch Lite at Target for $199.99\n\n12. AirPods for an elite headphone experience\n\nYou can get this big ticket item for $15 off, too. (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nIf someone doesn't own Apple AirPods already, they're probably asking for a pair this holiday season. These iconic white 'buds have earned a cult following and their popularity doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. Not only are they trendy, but they actually perform well. In fact, they\u2019re the best true wireless headphones we\u2019ve ever tested for their great sound and seamless connectivity. Plus, you can score an extra $15 off them right now, which is still the lowest price we've seen.\n\nGet the Apple AirPods with Charging Case (Latest Model) $144\n\n13. A streaming stick for the next binge-watching session\n\nThe Roku Stick is one of our favorite streaming devices. (Photo: Roku)\n\nNetflix, Hulu, and Prime Video look much better on a TV screen than the computer. But to do so, your recipient (or you!) is going to need a streaming device. The Roku Streaming Stick+ is the best affordable streaming device we\u2019ve ever tested. It\u2019s fast and offers full 4K and HDR for the ultimate binge-watching experience. Since it\u2019s bound to be a big hit around the holidays, you can beat the crowd by grabbing one early. Psst: You can also get it for $10 off right now, too.\n\nGet the Roku Streaming Stick+ at Amazon for $49.99\n\n14. A popular tracker for forgetful folks\n\nKeep track of your phone, keys, and wallet with the Tile. (Photo: Tile)\n\nAnyone who's always losing their keys, TV remote, or other valuable possessions needs a Tile Mate. We love this small tracking device because it easily attaches to the most important\u2014or most often forgotten\u2014personal items. The app makes it easy to track the Tiles and ding them to find them wherever they ended up. Currently, the 2018 Tile Mates are deeply discounted to make way for the 2020 models. For a great deal on a potential cure for forgetfulness, hop on these deals before they sell out.\n\n15. A surprise toy that blooms\n\nKids can care for and play with these growing dolls. (Photo: Skyrocket)\n\nKids these days love surprises, which is why the Skyrocket Blume Doll is going to be such a popular toy this year. These \"magic\" dolls come packaged in a pot. Simply add water and\u2014poof!\u2014the doll grows before your eyes. At just under $10, they're relatively inexpensive (phew!), and your kids will definitely want to collect them all. Pick up a few as stocking stuffers\u2014before they inevitably sell out during the holiday shopping rush.\n\nGet the Skyrocket Blume Doll at Amazon for $9.88\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered this holiday season.
