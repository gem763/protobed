Once owner Dan Gilbert and general manager Koby Altman sat down with Beilein, it didn't take long for them to realize he was the person they needed.\n\nBeilein appears to be an ideal fit.\n\n\"With young guys you need a culture first and you can't just build that,\" said forward Larry Nance, who expanded his game last season. \"You can't just throw a culture in and hope it works. You have to start from the bottom. I don't want to say he's starting from the bottom, but within the league, he's fresh. He's starting new. We're starting new. It's good that nobody is really above the other.\"\n\nBeilein inherits a team that went 19-63 last season, the inevitable freefall sealed when LeBron James packed up and left Cleveland for the second time as a free agent. It didn't help that All-Star forward Kevin Love was limited to just 22 games after undergoing toe surgery.\n\nFrom the start of training camp, Beilein has gone old school with the Cavs, who were more than a little stunned when he had them doing elementary-level movements normally seen in grade school practices.\n\n\"I hadn't done the Mikan drill in like 12 years,\" said Nance, referring to the time-tested exercise for basketball big men.\n\nBeilein's firmly believes even pros need to brush up on the basics.\n\n\"The veterans understand that there is slippage in the fundamentals, especially over a summer,\" Beilein said. \"There's just incredible slippage and you have to remind them of that. It's not their fault. ... For the good veterans it's like riding a bike, it's like, 'Oh, yeah, I should have boxed out there.' But you have to train them and keep it going.\"\n\nBeilein's next challenge is to keep the Cavs from going in reverse.\n\nLOVE STATUS\n\nWithout fail, Love begins another season encircled in trade talk.\n\nIt's been that way since he arrived in Cleveland, where he's gone from having a supporting role alongside James and Kyrie Irving on title contenders to being the Cavs' unquestioned top player and most important leader on a sub-.500 squad.\n\nLove doesn't want to go anywhere, and he's committed to nurturing his young teammates. However, the Cavs could be tempted to trade him for a package of players and/or picks that could hasten their turnaround.\n\nDYNAMITE DUO\n\nThe Cavs are counting on Garland, the No. 5 overall pick this season, and Collin Sexton to blossom into one of the league's best backcourts. Based purely on skill level and upside, the pair is already drawing comparisons to Portland's Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum.\n\nGarland played only five games at Vanderbilt before a left knee injury ended his college career. He's got all the tools, the right makeup and has an NBA pedigree as his father, Winston, played eight seasons in the league. Durability seems to be the only question mark about Garland.\n\nSECOND SEASON\n\nSexton's rookie season went from poor to polished.\n\nStung by being left off the NBA's rising stars team at the break, the speedy guard kicked his game into overdrive. He improved in all areas and wound up averaging 16.7 points on 43% shooting \u2014 21 points and 48% in the second half. He's got a scorer's mentality, but the Cavs need him to do other things and he added some muscle during the offseason to prevent other guards from pushing him around.\n\nOTHER ROOKIES\n\nThe Cavs added two other interesting rookies with first-round picks \u2014 swingman Dylan Windler and Kevin Porter Jr.\n\nWindler averaged 21.3 points, 10.8 rebounds and carried tiny Belmont to its first NCAA Tournament win. The Cavs like Windler's versatility and shooting range. He's been slowed by a leg injury so far.\n\nA five-star high school recruit, Porter was suspended from USC's team for bad behavior. The slim 6-foot-6 left-hander has all the moves, and he could provide Cleveland with scoring punch off the bench.\n\nGOLDEN YEAR\n\nThe Cavs are celebrating their 50th season, which began with two unfortunate incidents \u2014 owner Dan Gilbert's stroke and longtime broadcaster Fred McLeod's death.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
