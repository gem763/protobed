The 47-year-old Jones zipped a strike off the mound to Braves first baseman and good friend Freddie Freeman.\n\nTurns out, Jones was just getting warmed up.\n\nIn the ninth inning, while sitting near the Braves dugout, he reached out with both hands to snare Randy Arozarena\u2019s foul ball.\n\nJones, who played his entire career in Atlanta before retiring after the 2012 season, raised the ball above his head in triumph before flipping it into the dugout.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a good omen for the Braves. They lost 7-6 to the Cardinals, giving up four runs in the ninth.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chipper Jones had a big game, even as his former team lost Game 1 of its NL Division Series.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/nlds_cardinals_braves_baseball_39831_c0-123-2954-1845_s1770x1032.jpg?61ba0c22af4eaa16d9c698f07b66376308a8317f", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
