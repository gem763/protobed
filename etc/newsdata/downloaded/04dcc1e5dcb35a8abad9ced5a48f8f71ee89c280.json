The returned migrants have not been interviewed by U.S. asylum officers. But Gascon said his agency screens all participants to ensure they are not seeking U.S. asylum and want to go back. Gascon, head of the IOM\u2019s Mexico mission, said the program provides a safer and more humane means of return than the migrants could arrange on their own. The effort here, whose scope and controversial aspects have not been previously reported, is the first by the State Department and UN to target Central American migrants in Mexico on such a large scale. The State Department would not comment on the record about its role. Gascon said the State Department reached out to the IOM last year as caravans of thousands of Central American migrants traveled through Mexico toward the U.S. border.\n\nA U.S. flag is seen through the border fence between Mexico and U.S. U.S. President Donald Trump called the caravans an \u201cinvasion\u201d and has made stemming immigration a centerpiece of his administration and 2020 re-election campaign. Migrant advocates are particularly concerned about 347 people returned by the IOM who had been stuck in Mexico under a controversial Trump administration policy known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).\n\nConsuelo Aguilar, 36, and her daughter Andrea, 15, sit inside a shelter after they were sent by the Customs and Border Protection to Mexico from the U.S. under the MPP. \"I feel devastated, I saved so much money, my family lent me money to have a better life in the U.S. and they sent me back to Mexico,\" Consuelo said. \"The court is a lie, they are not going to help us, it's better if I go back to Honduras.\" Under that policy, which began Jan. 29, some migrants who make it across the U.S.-Mexico border are given a notice to appear in U.S. immigration court, then are then turned back to Mexico to wait the months it can take for their court cases to be resolved. In the past seven months, more than 30,000 migrants have been sent back under MPP, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Advocates say that the migrants often face danger and destitution in Mexican border towns, leaving them no good options.\n\nCecilia Chirinos, a Honduran migrant, rests inside a shelter after she was sent by the Customs and Border Protection to Mexico from the U.S. under the MPP. \"I crossed with my youngest son to meet my husband on the U.S. side. He crossed with my daughter at the same time, he was able to stay and I was sent back to Mexico,\" Chirinos said. \"I don't understand, they sent me and my son to a country that is the same or even more dangerous than Honduras. I don't feel safe here. I'm very sad.\" \u201cHow can it be a voluntary decision (to return home) given the conditions they face in Mexico? It\u2019s a choice between two hells,\u201d said Nicolas Palazzo, an attorney with El Paso-based Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center. Besides any danger they might face back home, there is another significant downside to leaving: If migrants do not show up for a U.S. court hearing, they can be ordered deported \u201cin absentia,\u201d reducing their odds of ever being granted refuge in the United States.\n\nDenia Carranza and her son, pose for a photo at Casa del Migrante migrant shelter. Denia Carranza, a 24-year-old Honduran returned to Mexico to await a court hearing set for October, decided instead to board a bus back home last week. She said she and her 7-year-old son had fled her hometown and a good job at a shrimp packing company after gang members threatened to kill her if she did not deal drugs to fellow employees. She had hoped to apply for U.S. asylum. But she said she was frightened in Ciudad Juarez - a battleground for drug cartels where the bulk of migrants await their hearings. Also, she had no job and no way to provide for her son. \u201cI am scared of going back to Honduras. But I am more afraid to stay,\u201d she said.\n\nA forensics team works at a crime scene. The U.S.-based nonprofit Human Rights First said it had documented more than 100 violent incidents perpetrated against migrants waiting in Mexico for U.S. court hearings this year, including rape, kidnapping, robbery, assault and police extortion. The IOM documented 247 deaths of migrants near the US-Mexico border this year through Aug. 15. In a July 30 letter to the IOM\u2019s Director General, 30 U.S. and international advocacy organizations said they feared the U.N. organization was returning migrants to countries they had fled \u201cout of desperation, not choice, and where they may not fully understand the consequences of failing to appear whenever summoned by a U.S. immigration court.\u201d There is no way of knowing how many of the migrants who opt to go home with IOM help might have been able to present a successful asylum claim. U.S. courts ultimately deny most such claims brought by Central Americans and the Trump administration has said many are fraudulent.\n\nCentral American migrants returning from the U.S. to Mexico under the MPP, queue outside a bus to go back to their countries. Migrants who are sent to Mexico under MPP may or may not be seeking U.S. asylum, but they generally have no opportunity to initiate such claims before being sent back across the border. The policy cuts out a traditional asylum screening step in which migrants are interviewed to establish whether they have a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of returning home. When the U.S. State Department approached IOM last fall, Gascon said, part of the goal was to counter what is saw as misinformation about how easy it was to get into the United States. IOM set up kiosks at a stadium in Mexico City, which was along the caravan route, and on the U.S.-Mexico border. It also helped spread the word about free rides back in migrant shelters.\n\nMigrant from Honduras, Dunia Ayala, carries one of her children outside a shelter after she was sent by the Customs and Border Protection to Mexico from the U.S. under the MPP. \"I crossed to the U.S. with my family, we gave ourselves up to the border patrol, then they took us to a place where it was very cold, they took all our belongings, jackets, shoelaces, everything, then started to question us. We feel very intimidated by them. My husband said to them, 'We didn't have the fortune to be born in a country like yours, we just want a better future for our kids.' Anyway they forced us to sign a paper of the MPP. Now, we have an appointment, but after the way they treated us, we are going back to Honduras.\" \u201cWhen they saw the reality, some decided to go home,\u201d he said of migrants. Three quarters of the migrants in the voluntary return program went back to Honduras, a fifth to El Salvador and the rest to Guatemala and Nicaragua, according to IOM figures through July 26 of this year. More than half were \u201cfamily units\u201d and about 100 were unaccompanied minors. Most of the migrants have been sent back from Mexico, and a small fraction from Guatemala. The IOM screens all migrants who ask to go home, but those awaiting U.S. hearings in Mexico also undergo an orientation program with Grupo Beta, an arm of Mexico\u2019s National Migration Institute, to ensure migrants understand their options, Gascon said.\n\nA migrant woman washes her clothes inside a shelter. So far, Gascon said, two people awaiting U.S. court hearings in Mexico who wanted a ride back were instead referred to the Mexican government to gauge their eligibility for asylum in Mexico. But advocates said they worried that Grupo Beta is not the best partner for IOM to ensure migrants\u2019 safety. \u201cMany organizations have documented time and again that Mexican migration officials don\u2019t refer people to (the national refugee office), they don\u2019t register fears of return, and they have even pressured people to withdraw (asylum) claims,\u201d said Kennji Kizuka, a researcher at the nonprofit Human Rights First. Mexican migration officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPeople cross the borders as migrants from different countries wait to apply for asylum in the United States.\n\nStory More than a dozen migrants awaiting U.S. hearings at the Casa de Migrante shelter in Ciudad Juarez told Reuters the weekly south-bound bus rides held some appeal. Though reluctant to give up on their American dreams, many didn\u2019t have lawyers and saw little prospect for success. \u201cAll that effort we made to get here from Honduras and now we\u2019re going back,\u201d said Angel Estrada, who had hoped to get care in the United States for his 9-year-old son, who has hemophilia. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad.\u201d", "description": "More than 2,000 Central American migrants seeking to settle in the United States have given up and accepted free rides home under a 10-month-old program funded by the U.S. government and run by a United Nations agency, according to a U.N. official.", "authors": ["Carlos Jasso", "Mica Rosenberg", "Kristina Cooke", "Daniel Trotta"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ-SN1dmL_d_4OOjl46oKe4o3OE37fDlg0ot7BnMar2VJ69OxmY-SN6FMt3gG4qfaej0cXRVbvHltdJVDUrZRKQTvzJpbIe1aovbwaJ3sOBUs"}
