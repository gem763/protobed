With rates low, monetary policy may take backseat to fiscal policy and that is happening in the US, Euro-zone, Japan. There was a sudden shift from growth and momentum to value. Cyclicals should also benefit. Bond yields rose and bonds and bond-proxies [utilities, consumer-staples, real-estate] fell. Active managers benefitted from these developments.\n\nPg 11, Streetwise: There was a violent shift from growth to value last week. Will it continue? Index stock fund assets are now more than those for the active stock funds. Payment processor Square [SQ] is testing a free stock trading service to compete with Robinhood . Viacom [VIAB] is testing free, ad-supported streaming Pluto TV . Apple [AAPL] underpriced its streaming Apple TV+ at $4.99/mo with 1-yr free for phone, computer, Apple TV buyers. [A collection of several disjointed ideas]\n\nPg 14-15: 74th UN General Assembly starts in NYC on Tuesday. FOMC Statement and Powell\u2019s press conference on Wednesday. BOE, BOJ monetary policies on Thursday.\n\nUS median household income is $63 K. It is the same as prior peaks in 1999 and 2007 on inflation-adjusted basis.\n\nA surprise in the new Apple iPhone 11 was the new photo/video features \u2013 3 lenses; easy switch from still to video mode; slow-motion capabilities for the front-facing cameras for slowfies [that may be a new term to catch on].\n\nSoftware stocks have been weak. Adobe [ADBE] on Tuesday will provide a data point for software business.\n\nData this week: NY Fed Empire State manufacturing survey on Monday; housing market index, industrial production on Tuesday; housing starts on Wednesday; LEI, existing home sales on Thursday; household net worth on Friday.\n\nClosed: Japan on Monday.\n\nBullish Recommendations: AT&T [T; stock rallied on 1% stake by activist Paul Singer/ Elliott who criticized recent expensive M&A, wants divestiture of DirectTV , etc; pg 16];\n\nTapestry [TPR; yield 5.3%; fwd P/E 9.8; buybacks; low debt; new CEO; brands Coach (fashion accessories; 71% of revenue), Kate Spade (women\u2019s fashions; struggling), Stuart Weitzman (shoes); potential turnaround; pg 17];\n\nViacom + CBS [VIA + CBS; Bob Bakish will run the combined company; focus will be on merger synergies, content development, streaming, ad-supported Pluto TV , etc; pg 19];\n\nAmerco [UHAL; yield 0.4%; fwd P/E 18.7; U-Haul notes have attractive yields but are illiquid; DIY moving and self-storage; Shoen family owns 50%; pg 20].\n\nBearish Recommendations: None self standing\n\nPg 21: Argentina is in crisis: Domestic spending this year may fall -6.8%; peso fell -70%; inflation +50%; Government has imposed capital controls and is trying to restructure/reprofile foreign debt. The IMF loan of $57 billion in 2018 was to prevent any of this. Savers who can have moved money overseas. Soybean exports to China didn\u2019t rise due to swine flu in China. IMF growth assumptions didn\u2019t materialize. IMF is now stuck supporting Argentina to avoid a total collapse.\n\nPg 22: Cover Story, \u201cRailroad Stocks Struggle as Challenges Mount\u201d. Railroads [CSX, UNP, CNI, NSC] have outperformed SP500 but the future is uncertain due to declining freight volumes and competition from trucking. Much of the efficiency gains from precision scheduled railroading [PSR] are behind. There were also gains from price increases and controversial price shifting away from truckers for multimodal transports. The P/Es may be under pressure.\n\nPg 27: Contrarian Investing. Rupal Bhansali [ Ariel ] has a new book, Non-Consensus Investing: Being Right When Everyone Else is Wrong , 2019. Watch when pessimism goes too far [e.g. France now] or when failure is priced in, but success/turnaround is not [e.g. MSFT in 2012]. [These are just a couple of teasers and the book has much more]\n\nPg 28: Apple [AAPL] launched its streaming Apple TV+ in a crowded field at a low price of $4.99/mo and it will be free for 1 year for buyers of phones, Macs, Apple TV. But the streaming content will be limited initially. Low pricing may also hurt earnings but AAPL denied that. Core iPhone business is struggling with unexciting iPhone 11 [until 5G in 2020].\n\nPg 30: Income from oil/gas E&P stocks: OXY, APA, COP, NBL, etc. Risk is that in this cyclical business, dividends may fluctuate.\n\nPg 31: Timothy Ryan and John Miller of strategic income NSAOX [the most flexible muni OEF in Nuveen lineup] note that there are 55,000 muni issuers with almost 2 million muni bond issues with average issue size of $25 million. Fund does invest in HY munis and distressed munis. It can also hedge for rates by shorting Treasuries.\n\nPg 32: The SEC may finally approve some Bitcoin ETFs after it recently approved an ETF open to qualified investors that trades privately [XBTCZ].\n\nPg 34: Sean Darby, Jefferie s in HK. The ECB easing this week [rate cut; QE] will weaken euro. ESG in Europe is getting a lift by populists. Problems in HK started with the extradition bill that has been withdrawn but demonstrations continue for other issues. Government will likely diffuse the situation with economic stimulus than aggressive police/military measures, so HK stocks may be a buy now. HK GDP is now only 3% of China GDP [vs 18-19% in 1997 when control switched from UK to China]. Keep in mind key dates: Oct 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of PRC; the US elections in 2020; centenary of the Communist Party in 2021, and there will be motivation to resolve the HK issues, and the US-China trade problems by both sides. The US Fed may cut rates a few times and then raise it. In the meantime, the US housing stocks will benefit from low mortgage rates. PBOC will soon unveil its digital currency e-yuan well ahead of other countries and may have a first-mover advantage.\n\nPg 40: There has been a sudden shift from growth, momentum, low-volatility to value. This came as bond yields rose. Will this shift stay? That depends on the US-China trade talks.\n\nPg 42: Jim Grant, Current Yield. The US rates peaked in 1981 and now there are calls for zero/negative rates. This may end in monetary debasement, bond shakeout, higher gold prices. Grant says that Reider/BLK, who supports his view, suggests real-assets that will hold value \u2013 dividend-paying stocks, real-estate, commodities [gold, etc]. [Of course, some say that the end run from here to negative rates will cause a massive bond rally that may indeed end badly later, but why leave the train too early?]\n\nExtras from Friday \u2013 I try to guess on Friday which features will make it in the weekend edition but the following guesses didn\u2019t make it. Almost 75-80% of the weekend edition is now available by 9:00 PM Central on Friday. Barron\u2019s revised website has \u201cInterests\u201d tabs similar to columns topics and that makes it easier to find potential items for the weekend edition. This is also the reason for earlier postings on Saturday \u2013 I do wait for my paper delivery [typically between 5:00-6:30 AM Central] to fill in some data.\n\nNone\n\nYBB", "description": "Pg 7, Up & Down Wall Street: The Fed is expected to cut rates on Wednesday.
