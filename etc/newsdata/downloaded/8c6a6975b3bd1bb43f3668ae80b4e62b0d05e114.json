Long-term, sustainable growth is very attractive,\u201d he says from his base in Boston.\n\nChandler, who is on a flying visit to Nitro\u2019s office in Dublin, where the bulk of the group\u2019s engineering and product team is based, is alive to the changing sentiment.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve probably had some technology companies that weren\u2019t truly technology companies, chasing technology multiples,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of companies that have been built with pretty poor unit economics. You can fund those companies in certain markets, but not all.\u201d\n\nWhat Nitro has on its side is a history that suggests it has been able to get funding in different markets, and for different reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChandler had grown up reading about Warren Buffett and Graham \u2013 \u201cI was a bit of weird kid,\u201d he says \u2013 but as a high schooler living south of Launceston, it was the huge fortunes being made in the Dot Com era that drew him towards starting technology businesses.\n\nHe started his first company at 16 and his second at 21, while studying at Melbourne\u2019s RMIT. By 2005 he had co-founded Nitro, a small start-up offering the first real alternative to the legacy PDF tool. Fellow co-founder Richard Wenzel also remains with the business as senior vice president of tax and treasury. The business shifted to San Francisco in 2009.\n\nIn the early days, Nitro was essentially bootstrapped, with just $1.5 million raised over the seven years to 2012. Major funding rounds in late 2014 and early 2017 were more focused on driving growth.\n\nChandler won\u2019t discuss figures, but it is understood Nitro\u2019s annual revenue in the 2020 financial year will be around $US40 million ($58 million). He says the business is hovering between cashflow negative and break even.\n\n\u201cWe could be profitable tomorrow right now if we chose to be, but we continue to invest in the business because we believe in the size of the opportunity,\u201d Chandler says.\n\nHe quotes Ben Graham\u2019s famous line to emphasise the long-term view he\u2019s tried to take: In the short run the market is a voting machine, in the long run it\u2019s a weighing machine.\n\n\u201cYou can be temporarily right but if it\u2019s not supported by good fundamentals, eventually those decisions catch up with you,\u201d Chandler says.\n\nThere have been a few key strategic tweaks along the way, including the shift from a sales model built around one-off license sales to subscriptions in 2016, which has pushed revenue growth from the enterprise-focused part of the business (the majority) above 50 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the most important change has been the move from a focus on small business customers to enterprises.\n\nNitro says its products have been deployed to 65 per cent of the Fortune 500, including ExonMobil, UnitedHealth Group, Wood Group, Thermo Fisher, BNY Mellon, Chubb, Experian, Caterpillar and Icon. Big Australian customers include Ausenco, Bluescope Steel, Pacific National and CBRE.\n\nThe shift to enterprise customers means Nitro is riding a key tech trend.\n\nWhile consumer-facing tech companies are out of favour, the share prices of US enterprise software groups have performed strongly, with IPOs from the likes of cloud computing group Fastly, video software provider Zoom Technologies, monitoring firm Datadog and cyber security group Crowdstrike delivering strong gains from investors.\n\nThese businesses enjoy a tailwind from the overdue digitising of the enterprise, which is being underpinned by two key factors.\n\nFirstly, big companies are seen as more stable than SMEs in times of economic fragility.\n\nAnd secondly, big companies have been slow to digitise back-end processes because of the cost and complexity involved.\n\nBut Chandler says the digital interfaces these big companies have built for their customers have forced something of a reckoning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe tells the story of a big bank he\u2019s seen where a customer can apply for a loan on their smartphone within minutes, but the back-end processes involves the collation of a bunch of PDF documents that get sent to India to be manually entered in a database before the documents are then printed out and authorised, then scanned again and emailed back to the customer.\n\nWhat Chandler calls \u201canalogue interruptions\u201d in a business process \u2013 that is, having to print something out \u2013 is where Nitro\u2019s opportunity lies.\n\n\u201cWe find our value proposition resonates big and small, but especially in these very large organisations where you couldn\u2019t possibly know where all those analogue interruptions happen.\u201d\n\nBattery\u2019s Michael Brown says the digitisation of big business is in its early phase, and argues Nitro\u2019s ability to cover what DocuSign does in e-signing products and Adobe does with digital documents is its advantage.\n\n\u201cNitro comes in with a great user interface, fully integrated\u2026 and they do it at a price point that is really compelling. That is game changing in our opinion.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Nitro hasn\u2019t grown its product suite by buying up other firms and making them fit.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been very thoughtful and methodical about how they\u2019ve built the business.\n\n\"We haven\u2019t done lot acquisitions and stitch things together...it\u2019s been very organic and pure.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown says Nitro will carefully consider its options; the wave of private capital that has flooded into technology as global interest rates have fallen means there are plenty of options for technology companies with unique propositions. Having a pathway to profitability doesn\u2019t hurt right now, either.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the benefit of not having to raise capital right now.\u201d\n\nGiven Brown has been in venture capital since 1998, I can\u2019t resist asking how this current period of very high tech valuations compares to the Dot Com boom.\n\nBrown argues it\u2019s chalk and cheese. Back in the late 1990s, the internet was so new that it was bad experience for most consumers; this meant the eyeballs early internet companies won simply couldn\u2019t be monetised.\n\nToday\u2019s start-ups are on much firmer ground. Software is a vital part of many organisations and low-cost cloud infrastructure means start-ups can build much more resilient business models from day one.\n\nThe inflation in valuations is being driven not from hype and blind hope, but by the hunt for yield caused by falling rates.\n\nYes, investors may need to pay more to get into tech companies, but there\u2019s unlikely to be a tech wreck that wipes out returns.\n\n\u201cThey may be overvalued, but the big difference is there is actually value in these companies,\u201d Brown says.\n\nWho knows, even Ben Graham might agree.", "description": "The long-term approach to growth that digital document software group Nitro has taken looks smart in the current climate around tech and floats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7947%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_428/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3f3488bd8a1728d587a1661d39f4c0a03ad9ff26", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
