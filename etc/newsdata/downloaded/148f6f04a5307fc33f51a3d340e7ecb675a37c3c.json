In this episode, a rumor spreads that the campus police are coming and the protesters begin piling furniture in front of the doors to keep the cops out.\n\nWhat the protesters don\u2019t know is that President Bridges has already ordered the police (the campus police force had six officers in all) to stand down. So no one is coming. In any case, the students\u2019 plans to resist a police siege are interrupted by an admissions officer who begins shouting loudly in the hallway about what the students are doing. \u201cUse your frickin\u2019 brains. This ain\u2019t doing nothing\u2026You want to block the freaking doors. This ain\u2019t changing nothing.\u201d The man seems to be having a meltdown.\n\nAt the same time, professors are being held in the building by protesters who keep trying to guilt them into caring about whatever issues the students have. Some mobs of students are also stopping cars and deciding who is allowed on and off the campus. It\u2019s an instant police state.\n\nBut the main goal is still to force the top administrators to sign off on the list of demands. Protest leader Jamil went into President Bridges\u2019 office and asked if anyone needed anything. Bridges replied, \u201cJamil, I need to pee.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold it,\u201d Jamil replied. The students are playing at controlling the campus and the administration is playing along. There\u2019s a long scene near the end of this clip that explains why. A group of teachers holding a teacher appreciation day with cake find themselves being admonished by the protesters for not showing enough support for the cause. \u201cDidn\u2019t you educated us on how to do sh*t like this?\u201d one student protester said. She seemed genuinely confused. The protesters really were doing exactly what they\u2019ve been programmed to do by the far left faculty. Why wasn\u2019t the faculty joining in?\n\nThis episode wraps up with Jonathan Haidt, author of The Coddling of the American Mind, comparing two views of what education should be, one based on J.S. Mill and one based on Karl Marx. \u201cIf we imagine a university based upon a more Marxist approach to intellectual life, it\u2019s going to look extremely different,\u201d Haidt said. You can probably guess which one Evergreen is modeling.", "description": "\"imagine a university based upon a more Marxist approach to intellectual life...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Evergreen-blockade.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
