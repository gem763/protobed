Both were airlifted to hospital where they are undergoing treatment.\n\nThe attack was the latest in a series in the Whitsunday Islands. Mr Raddon and Mr Maggs were on a day cruise when the attack happened at Hook Passage, about 10km from the site of another fatal shark attack last November.\n\nA Mackay Base Hospital spokesperson told The Telegraph that the two men had undergone surgery this afternoon and are now in a stable condition.\n\nA Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) said the call for help came in at 10.22am local time, and that the men were initially treated on board their cruise boat by two paramedics who happened to be on board as guests.\n\nQAS manager Tracey Eastwick said it is believed the shark attacked one man first, then returned and attacked the other man.\n\n\u201cThe international paramedics \u2026 applied tourniquets to both patients and continued treatment on board until they reached Abell Point Marina, where they met two of our frontline crews there,\u201d she told a media conference.\n\nShe added that the pair were in \"good spirits\" and discussing the rugby world cup during the journey to hospital.\n\nThe cruise company involved, ZigZag Whitsundays, said that it had suspended tours.\n\nThere have been three fatal shark attacks off the coast of Queensland since 2006. There have been numerous shark attacks in the Whitsunday Island group in recent years. A woman and child were believed to have been mauled by a shark in January, while a man died of his injuries and a 12-year-old girl lost a leg in two separate attacks last year.\n\n#RACQ#CQRescue arriving at Mackay Base Hospital at 12.40pm with two patients on board after a Shark attack in the Whitsundays. pic.twitter.com/UJy46tYEIi \u2014 RACQ CQ Rescue (@cq_rescue) October 29, 2019\n\nIn September this year a \u2018catch and remove\u2019 shark protection programme was removed from 27 beaches in Queensland's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, an area which includes the site of the attack, following a court ruling.\n\nThe \u2018catch and remove\u2019 program was killing the sharks, and was challenged in the courts by the Humane Society International.\n\nA tribunal found that killing the sharks did not improve swimmer safety. The Queensland government also recently lost its battle for the right to use nets and drum lines to catch and kill sharks.\n\nDr Simon J Allen from the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Bristol told The Telegraph last month that there is a distinct lack of evidence that lethal or even sub-lethal shark control programs are effective in minimising risk to swimmers of a negative interaction with a shark.", "description": "A British backpacker had his foot bitten off by a shark as he was attacked while snorkeling at a chain of popular tourist islands off\u00a0the coast of Queensland, Australia.", "authors": ["Giovanni Torre"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SgY8gKOB15mjgNUV_rgZ.g--~B/aD00ODU7dz03NzY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/5f63c76cd60a9b551d8ef9d8769d1c35", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
