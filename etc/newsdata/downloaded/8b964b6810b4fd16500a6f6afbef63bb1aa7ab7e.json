But, as you\u2019d expect, they replaced the \u201co\u201d with the players\u2019 heads, so it read \u201cmake it c*nt\u201d.\n\nThe campaign was used to promote the team for the RedWire University Athletic Association of the Philippines championship games.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the c-word holds the same meaning in the Philippines, or if it\u2019s quite as offensive, but the internet sure made it clear that they had dropped a sneaky c-bomb.\n\nThe team quickly deleted the images and re-uploaded them with the players no longer obstructing the letter \u201co\u201d, however, screenshots still made the rounds online.\n\nRedWire later issued a lengthy apology for the mishap.\n\nThe statement apologised for the \u201cgraphic design blunder\u201d and explained that the RedWire design team is completely comprised of volunteers, so at least nobody was paid for the c-bomb. They also claimed that the profanity was a mistake, and was completely unintentional.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure how nobody picked up on the profanity before the photos were posted, but I guess any publicity is good publicity, right?", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-06-at-8.45.54-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
