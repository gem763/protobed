In 2019, the startup recorded close to S$1 million in revenue. HighSpark\n\nWhen HighSpark founder Eugene Cheng was 19, he dressed like he was in his mid-30s.\n\nThe habit began after a networking session in 2013, where he was derided by an advertising manager for suggesting a teen could coach executives to deliver high-stakes presentations.\n\n\u201cYou are younger than my son. How can I trust you with important projects?\u201d the man asked, spurring the entrepreneur (who remembers the incident \u201cvividly\u201d) to look much older.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the last time he received such treatment. In the startup\u2019s early days, Cheng and co-founder Koh Kai Xin \u2013 both fresh out of Ngee Ann Polytechnic \u2013 often had clients take one look at their young faces and refuse to pay full price for their services.\n\nCheng scored his first customer entirely by accident, after slides he uploaded on presentation sharing site SlideShare got featured on the homepage, and were spotted by an employee of ad agency Dentsu Singapore.\n\nThe firm then hired him to make a presentation for the CEO.\n\nCheng learned to craft compelling decks and presentations by watching TED Talks and Photoshop tutorials on YouTube, and reading books on psychology, entrepreneurship, and presentation skills. HighSpark\n\nDiscussions around remuneration were when Cheng \u2013 now 25 \u2013 realised the business could be lucrative. He ended up being paid around S$3,200.\n\nHe and schoolmate Koh then landed freelance gigs at a design company, making slides for a telco.\n\nIt was there they confirmed two things: there was demand for quality presentations, and they possessed the skills to deliver them.\n\n\u201cWe assumed organisations had something, or knew something we didn\u2019t: a special process, or some special sauce,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cBut when we were part of that process, we realised it\u2019s nothing we couldn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nBut given their rocky start, the young founders agreed to lower prices to build up a client base.\n\nThe pair then asked former clients how much they thought their service was worth, and what problems it had helped to solve.\n\n\u201cWe got stuck with lower rates at the start because we were selling aesthetic design as a feature more than anything else\u2026 eventually we came to the conclusion that clients valued the storytelling aspect of our work,\u201d Cheng said.\n\n\u201cWe emailed other companies around the world and asked how much they charged,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were charging 10, 20 times more than us\u2026 this helped us benchmark ourselves and move up the food chain.\u201d\n\nToday, a group session at HighSpark costs between S$5,000 and S$7,000 a day for presentation, sales, and public speaking coaching.\n\nIts customers \u2013 about half of which are C-suite execs \u2013 hail from companies including Visa, Nike and Mastercard. HighSpark claims to have helped its clients raise over US$3 million in funding collectively.\n\nThe startup is now staffed by a seven-man team, and expects revenues in the high six figures this year. HighSpark\n\nThe seven-man startup expects to earn close to seven figures in annual revenue by the end of this year: about 600 times more than the initial capital of S$1,500.\n\nIt\u2019s also looking at expanding to other South-east Asian countries, and launching a book and online course.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret over your age. Age is not a problem, \u201d Cheng said when asked for his advice to young entrepreneurs struggling to be taken seriously.\n\n\u201cA lot of intimidation comes from putting other people on a pedestal,\u201d he added. \u201cConfidence is very important. Just be confident and make sure you do your job.\u201d\n\nAdded Koh: \u201cAt the end of the day, what customers care about is whether you can get the job done well, and whether you\u2019re pleasant to work with.\u201d\n\nSkipping university was \u201ca calculated decision\u201d\n\nWhile HighSpark\u2019s financials are enviable, Cheng and Koh (now 26) had to sacrifice friendships, romance, and even their degrees to get the business running.\n\nHe turned down a spot in a design course at the Singapore Institute of Technology, while she said no to a marketing course at the Singapore Institute of Management.\n\n\u201cI thought about my motivation for wanting a degree. If I was going to get a degree just for the label, I wasn\u2019t going to be mentally present,\u201d said Koh, who admitted her parents objected strongly at the beginning.\n\n\u201cBy running a startup, I would get to learn a lot faster, and I would get to learn things that school didn\u2019t teach,\u201d she added. \u201cBut with university, I wondered if what I learnt was going to be obsolete by the time I graduated.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if the business failed, I could always attend next year\u2026 (skipping university) was a calculated decision. I weighed the pros and cons,\u201d she said.\n\nKoh, 26, worked odd jobs since the age of 12, and is no stranger to entrepreneurship. HighSpark\n\nBoth founders admitted to feeling anxious about missing out when their friends moved on to further studies and they were left working out of Ngee Ann Polytechnic\u2019s canteen, earning S$1,500 a month for two years.\n\nBut after reading university textbooks and notes, Cheng realised they already knew what others were paying thousands to learn.\n\nTo educate himself, he spent S$100 a month on psychology, entrepreneurship, and presentation skills books by David Ogilvy, Brian Tracy, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Friedrich Nietzsche, Seneca, Aristotle and Plato, among others.\n\nHe would then summarise the main learning points for Koh.\n\n\u201cBooks provide real life case studies and a tangible framework to follow. If you want to solve a problem, find a book that answers that question. You can learn from people\u2019s mistakes and avoid them,\u201d said Cheng.\n\nThe founder added that buying books forced him to read them to get his money\u2019s worth, and he liked physical copies as they provided a visual reminder of the lessons learnt.\n\nTheir advice for other poly grads? Try harder to find direction in life.\n\n\u201cAt 19, most poly kids have no clarity and direction, so collect anecdotes and experiences. Focus on things relevant to the future, not what\u2019s relevant to you now, like playing with friends,\u201d Cheng said.\n\nAdded Koh: \u201cExpose yourself to experiences that help you discover interests and strengths. This gives you more clarity on what you want \u2013 and don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the time comes for you to make a career decision, you can make the right decision, rather than just aimlessly follow the herd.\u201d\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - In six years, the duo had multiplied their initial capital 600 times..
