Exxon declined to comment on Sunday.\n\nThe big picture: The U.S., despite the pullback from Syria, is reportedly deploying troops to a northeastern region to prevent oilfields from falling into ISIS' hands.\n\nBut, but, but: Oil majors are unlikely to take interest in the idea, analysts tell Axios.\n\n\"I doubt there will be a rush by oil companies to work in a region that is a hotspot for military action and civil unrest,\" said Michael Webber, an energy scholar with the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n\"International oil and gas companies aren\u2019t looking for risky places to operate, they are looking for safer places to operate \u2014 which is one reason why west Texas has been enjoying a boom in production,\" he said in an email exchange.\n\nWhere it stands: Syria, even at its peak, was not among the world's big oil producers.\n\nProduction peaked at roughly 600,000 barrels per day in the mid-1990s, but has long been in decline and plummeted when a civil war broke out nearly a decade ago. It's now just a tiny fraction of those levels and would require substantial investment to revive.\n\nAnd there would be legal barriers too. \u201cOil, like it or not, is owned by the Syrian state,\u201d Brett McGurk, former U.S. envoy to the multilateral anti-ISIS coalition, said last week, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\nOne level deeper: Webber, deputy director of UT-Austin's Energy Institute, criticized the Trump administration's maneuvers.\n\n\"[T]he announcement that oil was a motivator for our troops\u2019 movements affirms critics\u2019 worst conclusions that U.S. foreign policy and defense strategy are about oil and no longer about defending human rights or promoting democracy abroad,\" he said.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "There's unlikely to be a rush by oil companies to work in a region that is a hotspot for military action and civil unrest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/6QqDJArDzfZ6WDapuhY3reksR_I=/0x525:6720x4305/1920x1080/2019/10/27/1572202999972.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
