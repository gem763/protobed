The statement urges readers to look beyond what they see at first glance, which has some speculating that it\u2019s in response to the drama involving her dad.\n\nVideo: Tiffany Trump Got Snubbed by Her Dad in a Big Way\n\n\u201cStudy me as much as you like, you will never know me. For I differ a hundred ways from what you see me to be,\u201d the poem reads. \u201cPut yourself behind my eyes, and see me as I see myself. Because I have chosen to dwell in a place you cannot see.\u201d\n\nView photos (Photo: Instagram/Tiffany Trump) More\n\nThe statement from the first daughter comes after President Trump\u2019s personal assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, was forced to resign from her role at the White House on Thursday. Politico first reported that Westerhout bragged to reporters during a dinner party that she had a better relationship with Trump than his own daughters. She also reportedly alleged that Trump did not like being in pictures with Tiffany because he thought she was overweight.\n\nAfter the statements hit the news, Trump told reporters that Westerhout had apologized for the slip of the tongue.\n\nView photos The president with daughter Tiffany and wife Melania in April.

She was very down,\u201d Trump told the press. \u201cAnd she said she was drinking a little bit. And she was with reporters, and everything she said was off the record. And that still doesn\u2019t really cover for her. She mentioned a couple of things about my children.\u201d\n\nThe president also took to Twitter to publicly praise his daughter. He also said that Westerhout is a \u201cvery good person\u201d who \u201chad a bad night.\u201d\n\nWhile Madeleine Westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement, she is a very good person and I don\u2019t think there would ever be reason to use it. She called me yesterday to apologize, had a bad night. I fully understood and forgave her! I love Tiffany, doing great! \u2014 Donald J.
