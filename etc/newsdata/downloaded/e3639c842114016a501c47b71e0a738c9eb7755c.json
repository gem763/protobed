The shooting, which was one of the country's deadliest, sparked a heated debate about gun control and led to the introduction of legislation that would have banned certain types of firearms.\n\nOn Monday, Hockley took to social media to remember him in several emotional tweets.\n\n\"Today it's been 2,474 days since Dylan was murdered at Sandy Hook,\" she wrote. \"2,474 days since he's been gone from my life. He was only in my life for 2,473 days. I feared today. Would him being gone longer than he was here mean I would forget him?\"\n\nToday it's been 2,474 days since Dylan was murdered at Sandy Hook. 2,474 days since he's been gone from my life.

Hockley, who was honored by People in 2016 for activism, said she just wants \"people to know that gun violence is preventable.\"\n\n\"I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to save other [lives],\" she said in an interview with the magazine.\"I don\u2019t want any other parent to ever be in my shoes and to know their child could have lived.\"", "description": "The mother of a 6-year-old boy who was killed in a 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook paid a touching tribute to him on Twitter this week.", "authors": ["Justin Chan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pFXVI2DCdV.j6vATaFj9KA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/901x590+0+42/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/8aeefab0-dfab-11e9-8ef7-4be45320309b", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
