His Victims Were Vulnerable and Overlooked", "language": "en", "text": "When Martha Cunningham was found dead near Knoxville, Tennessee, in January 1975, her body was bruised, her clothes had been pulled off and she was missing her purse.\n\n\n\nNot long after, the police closed the case. A medical examiner\u2019s report listed the cause of Cunningham\u2019s death as unknown, according to David Davenport, a retired investigator for the Knox County Sheriff\u2019s Office who later reopened the case.\n\n\n\nNearly half a century later, Cunningham\u2019s family has learned what they and the police now believe is true: that Cunningham, 34, was one of scores of people killed by Samuel Little, whom the FBI identified this week as the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history. Jessie Lane Downs, Cunningham\u2019s sister, said she was still pained that the case was closed so quickly, all those years ago.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe police department did not ask the family any questions or anything when this happened,\u201d Downs said. \u201cThey could\u2019ve settled this, and look at all the people that got killed.\u201d\n\n\n\nLittle, who the authorities say has confessed in recent months to 93 killings between 1970 and 2005, told them about killing a woman in the Knoxville area that he remembered only as Martha, officials say. Little has not been charged in Cunningham\u2019s death, but Davenport said the authorities believe that Little was alluding to her in his confession.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives at the Knox County Sheriff\u2019s Office said no one was available to speak about Cunningham\u2019s case. But Davenport, who retired from there in the last year, said it was clear that her death had not gotten the attention it deserved.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was no file in existence, except for the medical examiner\u2019s report,\u201d he said. \u201cThat speaks for itself, that it wasn\u2019t investigated the way it should\u2019ve been.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the year since Little, 78, began confessing to killings from a prison cell in California, a portrait has begun to emerge of his victims that offers one explanation for how a serial killer could have managed to go undetected, unnoticed for so many decades.\n\n\n\nMany of the victims were vulnerable women. Most of them were black, and many were poor. Some were estranged from family members or living far from relatives. And some were isolated, users of drugs or alcohol, or prostitutes. And, in many cases, their deaths did not draw the same level of attention and outrage as other killings.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the unfortunate realities of policing is that departments that are under pressure to solve a variety of murders may pay less attention to victims from a more vulnerable population if they don\u2019t have the same organized community pressure to solve those crimes,\u201d said Jim Bueermann, the former police chief of Redlands, California, and the former president of the National Police Foundation. \u201cIf a killer wants to do as many murders as possible, they\u2019ll start to exploit those gaps in the social fabric and those weaknesses in law enforcement with victims that few people care about.\u201d\n\n\n\nLittle drew little attention until 2014, when he was sentenced to life in prison for three murders. No one representing Little, who has been convicted of at least eight murders, could be reached for comment. Prosecutors around the country are still weighing whether to formally charge him for the many killings in at least 14 states that he has told the authorities about in recent months, although the authorities say they believe his confessions. It is uncertain how many charges he will ultimately face.\n\n\n\nBut for families who believe their loved ones were among Little\u2019s victims, the flood of confessions has brought a sense, for some, of closure, but also new pain.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Lord kept us through this and I had gotten myself together, until this came up,\u201d Downs said. Cunningham\u2019s family described her as less vulnerable than some of the other victims; she was a gospel singer who played the piano in church, they said, and someone who put religion first.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was so mad when I saw this man grinning,\u201d she said of Little\u2019s videotaped confessions. \u201cHe\u2019s grinning and my sister is dead. It just tears me up.\u201d\n\n\n\nMinnie Hill said the last time she spoke to her daughter, Rosie Hill, was during a rushed telephone call from Florida in August 1982. Hill said Rosie sounded uncharacteristically worried.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe let me know she was up into something and the only way she could get out of it was to come home,\u201d Hill recalled.\n\n\n\nRosie, who was 20 years old, never made it back home to Memphis, Tennessee, and her mother said she never found out what sort of trouble her daughter had been in.\n\n\n\nWithin 72 hours, the authorities say, Rosie Hill became a victim of Little.\n\n\n\nLittle has not been charged in the case, but he has told detectives that he strangled Hill after he met her in a bar in Marion County, Florida. He said he dumped her body in a wooded area.\n\n\n\nInvestigators have said that he remembered her because she had fought back.\n\n\n\nMinnie Hill said that by the time her daughter\u2019s body was discovered, she was unrecognizable. Rosie Hill was ultimately identified through X-rays. Yet the elder Hill said that even then, she had not quite believed that her daughter was dead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor two years, I waited for a call from her,\u201d she said. \u201cOr for her to come home.\u201d\n\n\n\nMinnie Hill, who raised her daughter\u2019s young child \u2014 she was 2 when Rosie Hill died \u2014 said she was not convinced that the authorities had done all they could have to solve the crime.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I went down there to ask around, no one knew anything,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she had forgiven Little, although she said she was troubled especially to learn that Little told investigators that he believed God intended him to carry out his crimes. \u201cThat is between him and the good Lord,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nExperts said Little\u2019s case was eerily similar to that of Lonnie D. Franklin Jr., the so-called Grim Sleeper, who was convicted of murdering nine women and one teenage girl in South Los Angeles beginning in the 1980s before he was convicted and sentenced to death in 2016.\n\n\n\nThe effort to capture Franklin was muddled by the high number of murders in Los Angeles in the 1980s, which included homicides attributed to other serial killers.\n\n\n\nBut, like Little, Franklin had targeted young black women, including drug users and prostitutes. Relatives complained that the police and the media paid less attention to Franklin\u2019s victims. They said that slowed efforts to bring Franklin to justice.\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times. \u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "When Martha Cunningham was found dead near Knoxville, Tennessee, in January 1975, her body was bruised, her clothes had been pulled off and she was missing her purse.
