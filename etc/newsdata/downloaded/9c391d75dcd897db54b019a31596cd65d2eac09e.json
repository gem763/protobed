But his message got laughs because there\u2019s an element of truth in it, known only to executives who have actually gone through the experience.\n\nGoing public remains one of the most attention-grabbing, if not misunderstood, processes in business. According to Renaissance Capital, a total of 190 companies went public in 2018, 30 more than the previous year, and proceeds from these initial public offerings (IPOs) reached $47 billion. The total for 2019 would have been even higher had WeWork not so publicly crashed and burned.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue with results like that, and often companies have good reasons for turning to the public markets. But it\u2019s not an easy road. A public company has more transparency to stakeholders and additional complexity, and is more scrutinized by the investing public and more expensive to keep compliant with regulators.\n\nThat\u2019s partly what I learned on my own entrepreneurial journey recently when the bank I started and continue to run went public. I discovered how common it is for entrepreneurs to be blind-sided by how it works.\n\nSure, there\u2019s plenty of advice out there \u2014 checklists, first-person accounts \u2014 all designed to make the decision seem like a clear-cut, well-trodden path. But here\u2019s what most founders don\u2019t know:\n\nMake sure you know your \u2018why\u2019\n\nPublic-company CEOs have more difficult jobs. In order to want that added difficulty, you have to have a reason to take the leap. Maybe you need access to capital to support acquisitions and get bigger, or maybe you simply want to have better access to the debt and equity markets for financing later on. There are a lot of potentially good reasons to go public \u2014 you need to make sure one of them actually makes sense for you and your company.\n\nEverybody is an expert except for you\n\nFrom the investment bankers, to the lawyers, to your other advisers, everyone you work with on an IPO has likely done it a hundred times and knows exactly what to do to extract the most value for themselves out of the process. But for most entrepreneurs, it\u2019s typically our first time. We go on the road show, we give the presentations, but when it comes time to price the offering, most of it is out of our hands.\n\nEach adviser has multiple parties to answer to\n\nThe market is going to want to set that price as low as possible. Remember, the underwriters working on the deal also work for future investors, even though the company going public is the one that hired them. It\u2019s a similar case with auditors and lawyers. The company is technically their client, but at the end of the day they have to answer to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and their own professional standards.\n\nThat means they\u2019re going to push the founder to stick to the well-worn path that they know will ensure success, even if it\u2019s not always what might be best for the company. One small example: In our prospectus language, we were encouraged to use a common industry term, \u201cbranches,\u201d that our company had specifically avoided. Were the words \u201clocal boutique banks\u201d critical to our success as a public company? Probably not, but it reinforced to me that sometimes it\u2019s important to push back on the experts when they\u2019re asking you to change something for the sake of making their life easier, and in the process sanding off some of the edges that make your company unique.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s pivotal to look behind paid help for advice. Well before anyone goes public, they should seek out CEOs inside and beyond their industry who have made the change. Unbiased opinion is what you want \u2014 and that\u2019s the fastest way to get it.\n\nPrepare to own the process\n\nEverybody says they\u2019re going to drive the process \u2014 the investment bankers, lawyers and accountants all make that same claim. And at the end of the day, they don\u2019t.\n\nIn our own path to an IPO, we encountered avoidable delays that we had to manage around, simply because we thought there was a chance that if we didn\u2019t stay on our timeline things may not go so smoothly.\n\nAs it turns out, we were right. Not long after we went public, the IPO window in our industry got shut. No single factor led to that change, but it meant that had our team not pushed to stay on task, we might have missed our goal by assuming that somebody else we had hired to manage the process was actually doing so. Don\u2019t make that same assumption \u2014 own the process.\n\nThere\u2019s often no turning back\n\nOnce you\u2019ve started, things quickly move out of your control and hitting the brakes or backing up become difficult, if not impossible.\n\nMaybe you get two-thirds of the way through the process before you learn that your price range is going to be much lower than you expected. What do you do? You can try to shut it down and get out, but remember: This is a small world and the people who work on and buy into IPOs today will likely still be around a year or two from now if you want to come back and try again. The market may not be as receptive or interested a second time around.\n\nYour role in the company is going to change\n\nMany entrepreneurs go into the IPO process without thinking about what it will mean for them personally at the end of it all, and those are the leaders who end up being disappointed. Because the job does change.\n\nYou spend more time with institutional investors, working on regulatory filings and doing things that bear little resemblance to the work you did to build the company. Shareholders you\u2019ve confided in throughout every step of the pre-IPO process? They\u2019re no longer people you can talk to about anything. Everything you say to them about the company is now regulated. It\u2019s not necessarily better or worse, but it\u2019s certainly different.\n\nAnd it\u2019s certainly on the entrepreneur to do their own due diligence about the IPO process and learn as much as they can ahead of time. As long as you go in with realistic expectations, it can be a positive experience for all involved and set the business up for great things in the future.\n\nThe key is learning enough to have the right expectations. Hopefully this helps.\n\nScott C.
