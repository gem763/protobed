Nadella says the future of computing could actually be at the edge where computing is done locally before data is then transferred to the cloud for AI and machine learning purposes. What goes around, comes around.\n\nBut as Nadella sees it, this is not going to be about either edge or cloud. It\u2019s going to be the two technologies working in tandem. \u201cNow, all this is being driven by this new tech paradigm that we describe as the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge,\u201d he said today.\n\nHe said that to truly understand the impact the edge is going to have on computing, you have to look at research, which predicts there will be 50 billion connected devices in the world by 2030, a number even he finds astonishing. \u201cI mean this is pretty stunning. We think about a billion Windows machines or a couple of billion smartphones. This is 50 billion [devices], and that\u2019s the scope,\u201d he said.\n\nThe key here is that these 50 billion devices, whether you call them edge devices or the Internet of Things, will be generating tons of data. That means you will have to develop entirely new ways of thinking about how all this flows together. \u201cThe capacity at the edge, that ubiquity is going to be transformative in how we think about computation in any business process of ours,\u201d he said. As we generate ever-increasing amounts of data, whether we are talking about public sector kinds of use case, or any business need, it\u2019s going to be the fuel for artificial intelligence, and he sees the sheer amount of that data driving new AI use cases.\n\n\u201cOf course when you have that rich computational fabric, one of the things that you can do is create this new asset, which is data and AI. There is not going to be a single application, a single experience that you are going to build, that is not going to be driven by AI, and that means you have to really have the ability to reason over large amounts of data to create that AI,\u201d he said.\n\nNadella would be more than happy to have his audience take care of all that using Microsoft products, whether Azure compute, database, AI tools or edge computers like the Data Box Edge it introduced in 2018. While Nadella is probably right about the future of computing, all of this could apply to any cloud, not just Microsoft.\n\nAs computing shifts to the edge, it\u2019s going to have a profound impact on the way we think about technology in general, but it\u2019s probably not going to involve being tied to a single vendor, regardless of how comprehensive their offerings may be.", "description": "Speaking today at the Microsoft Government Leaders Summit in Washington DC, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made the case for edge computing, even while pushing the Azure cloud as what he called \u201cthe world\u2019s computer.\u201d While Amazon, Google and other competitors may have something to say about that, marketing hype aside, many companies are still in [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-08-08.33.07.jpg?w=709", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
