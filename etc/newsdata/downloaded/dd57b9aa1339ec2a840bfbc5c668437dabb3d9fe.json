(AP) - The Santa Barbara Zoo\u2019s 48-year-old Asian elephant, Little Mac, has been euthanized after a sharp decline in her health.\n\nThe zoo says Little Mac was euthanized Wednesday night in her exhibit yard, surrounded by keepers and staff.\n\nLittle Mac came to the zoo from India in 1972 with another female Asian elephant, Sujatha, who was euthanized last year.\n\nLittle Mac was named by Herb Peterson, the owner of several local McDonald\u2019s restaurants who paid for the airline flight. At the time she was a 1\u00bd-year-old, 4-foot-tall (1.2-meter) apparent orphan.\n\nThe zoo says her decline began in June with the onset of new medical issues in addition to other problems common in geriatric elephants.\n\nHer death marks the end of the Santa Barbara Zoo\u2019s elephant program.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Santa Barbara Zoo's 48-year-old Asian elephant, Little Mac, has been euthanized after a sharp decline in her health.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
