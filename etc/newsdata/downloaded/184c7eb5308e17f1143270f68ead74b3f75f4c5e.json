Yes, things are slightly more urgent if you\u2019re a government minister or a farmer or you have an interest in just-in-time supply chains.\n\nBut even if you\u2019re a normal person then there\u2019s not much time to get your finances braced for a possible no deal.\n\nBoris Johnson has maintained the chances of a no-deal exit are \u201ca million to one\u201d but, despite that, it\u2019s clearly an increasingly likely outcome.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThat leaves just a handful of weeks to prepare. By the time you\u2019re stocking up on Halloween sweets, it will be too late.\n\nSo what can you do in just three months? Here are some ideas.\n\nKnow where your money is\n\nA no-deal Brexit could mean bumpy times ahead, whether that\u2019s a short-term blip or the full-blown recession some people believe is ahead.\n\nDrawing up a budget means you know exactly what you can cut back on if times do get difficult.\n\nAashna Shroff, a personal finance spokesperson at money.co.uk, said: \u201cThe most helpful thing you can do is to get a clear idea of exactly how much you are spending every month. If you know what you are spending, you can see where you are able to cut some costs.\n\n\u201cI would draw up a budget so you can see exactly how much you are spending on your fixed, essential costs like mortgage or rent, utility bills and school fees, as well as other variable essential items like food and clothing.\n\n\u201cYou also need to break down how much you are spending on life\u2019s luxuries, such as entertainment and eating out.\u201d\n\nMake some savings, any savings\n\nThree months is not long to build up a financial safety net, especially if you do not have much wiggle room in your budget anyway. But it\u2019s important to save what you can.\n\nBen Faulkner, from EQ Investors, says: \u201cThe Office for Budget Responsibility believes a no-deal Brexit would plunge the UK into a recession, shrinking the economy by 2 per cent and push unemployment above 5 per cent.\n\n\u201cEstablish a rainy day fund in an easy access savings account.\u201d\n\nLike most financial commentators, he recommends accumulating three to six months\u2019 worth of salary in an account in order to ride out any storms. That\u2019s clearly not going to be possible if you don\u2019t already have that cushion saved.\n\nBut anything extra you can set aside between now and the possible no-deal day will help you cope a little better with any surprises that lie ahead.\n\nKnow exactly what you\u2019ve borrowed\n\nThere are so many different ways to borrow money, with store cards, overdrafts, credit cards and car finance that it can be all too easy to lose track of exactly what you owe.\n\nBut if there are difficult times ahead then it\u2019s essential to understand exactly what you owe and to have a repayment plan in place.\n\nThat way you can avoid that debt unintentionally creeping up if there is financial uncertainty ahead. Also, if you\u2019re steadily repaying any outstanding debt then you will be improving your credit score too.\n\nThink about fixing\n\nThere\u2019s no crystal ball when it comes to interest rates on credit products. However, if uncertainty causes you anxiety then it might be time to take action.\n\nJustin Basini, co-founder of credit checking company ClearScore, says: \u201cBrexit makes it difficult to predict what will happen in terms of interest rates. If the economy is struggling then they may stay low, but if inflation goes up then they may rise further.\u201d\n\nYou could consider switching to lower rates or even consolidating any debt so you know exactly where you are with repayments and interest.\n\nInvestors: keep calm and go global\n\nThere is a rocky road ahead but Michelle Pearce-Burke, co-founder of robo-investment service Wealthify, says it\u2019s important for investors not to make any sudden movements.\n\n\u201cFor investors, the key thing to remember is not to panic. If markets drop further as a result of a no-deal Brexit and you sell, you will make those losses real. Holding on to your investments gives them time to potentially recover and even grow, over the longer term.\n\n\u201cA no-deal Brexit is in all likelihood bad news for the pound. A weaker pound will impact your finances as well as the economy.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an investor, or considering becoming one, a smart choice is to add some global investments to your portfolio that are based in other currencies like the US dollar.\u201d\n\nSort your travel plans\n\nWhatever happens with Brexit, the British love affair with travelling to the European mainland won\u2019t go away.\n\nBut if you are planning to travel within Europe after a potential no-deal exit, it\u2019s really important to take a few extra steps to ensure you don\u2019t get into difficulties.\n\nFor example, you may need to renew your passport sooner than expected. Just now, British citizens are able to enter \u201cSchengen area\u201d countries with a valid passport, even if it has as little as a day left before it expires.\n\nHowever, if we do leave with no deal then the government\u2019s advice is to renew if you have less than six months left on your passport, or you may not be allowed to travel.\n\nA no-deal Brexit may cause delays at the airports as British travellers are no longer able to pass through the EU citizen passport controls, which are often quicker.\n\nWithout EU membership and unless something is arranged as part of a Brexit deal, travellers could no longer rely on a European Health Insurance Card (Ehic) to allow them to use local medical services on the same terms as a resident in an emergency.\n\nThat means that travel insurance is more essential than ever, as even a short visit to hospital could rack up thousands of pounds in medical bills. The price of cover may rise if British tourists can no longer rely on their Ehic but it will still be far cheaper than hospital bills.", "description": "It\u2019s really time to get ready for Brexit.
