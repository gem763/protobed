I'm really happy to get through in two sets.\"\n\nThe seventh seed is playing Basel for the 14th time and improved his record at the event to 12-13.\n\nThree-time major winner Wawrinka said his three-set final loss to Murray in Antwerp on Sunday proved useful in Basel.\n\n\"Antwerp really helped me today, I've got confidence in my game, the game is there.\"\n\nBut he refused to speculate on any London chances: \"I'm super-far away, so it's not at all in my mind.\"\n\nSixth seed David Goffin also stayed in the race to London with a 6-4, 6-4 defeat of 2014 US Open champion Marin Cilic.\n\nGoffin entered this week at provisional 10th in the race and is duelling with Italy's Matteo Berrettini, who currently stands eighth, and ninth-placed Roberto Bautista Agut.\n\nRicardas Berankis of Lithuania lined up a second-round match with third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas after defeating Pablo Andujar 6-1, 6-1.\n\nFilip Krajinovic will next take on fifth seed Fabio Fognini after going past Serb compatriot Laslo Djere, 6-1, 6-4.\n\nAustralian Alex De Minaur defeated Taylor Fritz of the US 6-3, 6-3 and Switzerland's Henri Laaksonen was put out by Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3, 6-4.\n\nResults from the ATP tournament in Basel on Wednesday (x denotes seeding):\n\n2nd round\n\nRoger Federer (SUI x1) bt Radu Albot (MDA) 6-0, 6-3\n\nAlex De Minaur (AUS) bt Taylor Fritz (USA) 6-3, 6-3\n\n1st round\n\nFrances Tiafoe (USA) bt Daniel Evans (GBR) 6-4, 6-2\n\nStan Wawrinka (SUI x7) bt Pablo Cuevas (URU) 6-3, 6-4\n\nRicardas Berankis (LTU) bt Pablo Andujar (ESP) 6-1, 6-1\n\nFilip Krajinovic (SRB) bt Laslo Djere (SRB) 6-1, 6-4\n\nDavid Goffin (BEL x6) bt Marin Cilic (CRO) 6-4, 6-4", "description": "Roger Federer crushed Radu Albot  to win his 22nd match in a row at the Swiss Indoors, earning a quarter-final place.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9261/35207a5f0db74ce081ac37a5bf42faa7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
