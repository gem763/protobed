Hungary's candidate, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, who was to oversee neighborhood policy and enlargement, and Romania's nominee, Rovana Plumb, intended as transport commissioner, were also shot down.\n\nIn a bland but also contradictory statement on Thursday, von der Leyen called for new haste while also insisting that \"all involved in the process need sufficient time to approach the next steps with care.\"\n\nVon der Leyen offered no clarity about when replacement nominees would be put forward. French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday criticized MEPs for rejecting Goulard and said he was not prepared to name a replacement. Meanwhile, Romania's government collapsed, leaving it unclear when Bucharest would be able to send forward a new name.\n\n\"We are currently in a democratic and transparent parliamentary process,\" von der Leyen said in the statement.\n\nThen, summing up the obvious, she said: \"I have proposed 26 candidates, 23 of whom have now been accepted. Three candidates did not obtain majority support for varied reasons. Therefore, the nominations for Hungary, Romania and France are still open.\"\n\nVon der Leyen went on to say that she had met the leaders of the three main, pro-EU political groups in Parliament and also with the Parliament president, David Sassoli, on Thursday.\n\n\"We must not lose sight of what is at stake: the next five years will be decisive for Europe in a difficult global environment,\" von der Leyen said in her statement. \"Europe must deal with Brexit, trade issues and conflicts in its immediate neighborhood. We must also face up to major challenges such as climate change, digitization and migratory flows.\"\n\n\"With so much at stake, it is now necessary, together with Parliament, to speed up the process so that Europe can act swiftly,\" she continued. \"At the same time, all involved in the process need sufficient time to approach the next steps with care. This must be a common objective.\"\n\nAs for the more immediate objective, putting new candidates before Parliament, von der Leyen's statement said nothing.", "description": "Incoming Commission president wants to move fast, but also take \u2018sufficient time to approach next steps with care.\u2019", "authors": ["David M.
