Local authorities couldn\u2019t investigate? They couldn\u2019t do anything about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think once the president is removed from office, any local authority\u2014 This is not a permanent immunity,\u201d Consovoy said.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m talking about while in office,\u201d Judge Chin continued.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Consovoy interrupted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the hypo[thetical]. Nothing could be done -- that\u2019s your position?\u201d the judge pressed.\n\n\u201cThat is correct. That is correct,\u201d Consovoy responded.\n\nThe exchange came as lawyers were arguing in the 2nd Circuit in New York over a subpoena for Trump\u2019s tax returns as part of a Manhattan county criminal investigation involving the president.\n\nTrump filed suit in New York last month to block the grand jury subpoena. It was dismissed by a federal district judge who said he had no jurisdiction to intervene in a state court proceeding.", "description": "Legal teams argue over a subpoena for president\u2019s tax returns.", "authors": ["Darren Samuelsohn"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1181889630-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
