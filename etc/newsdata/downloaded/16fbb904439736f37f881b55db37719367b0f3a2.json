(Photo by Rich Schultz/Getty Images)\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Noah Syndergaard kept using the same phrase: as of right now.\n\nAs of right now, he claims he\u2019s not concerned anymore about his extreme catching splits when throwing to Wilson Ramos instead of his preferred option, Tomas Nido.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAs of right now, the other players in the clubhouse are his family.\n\nAnd, lastly, as of now, he still respects the Mets\u2019 front office and ownership.\n\nSyndergaard\u2019s repeated use of those four words Tuesday was certainly telling. As of right now, he\u2019s still a Met. But, with each incident, like his latest meeting with the coaching staff to express his displeasure in not being paired with Nido during this past Sunday\u2019s 10-7 loss to the Phillies, it becomes harder and harder to see how these parties can coexist all that much longer.\n\nIt seems a matter of when, not if, Syndergaard will leave town.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit I can be stubborn at times, but I want the best of the best for the team and want to compete to the elite level I think I can compete at,\u201d Syndergaard said Tuesday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019m welcome and wanted here.\u201d\n\nWhile Syndergaard still possesses elite stuff that can match any pitcher in baseball, the growing expectation is that this partnership with the Mets will eventually run its course. It could be this offseason via a trade, or after the 2021 season when he\u2019s set to become a free agent, but it seems he\u2019ll be pitching elsewhere.\n\nThe Padres and Rangers seem like potential fits for the sturdy Texan.\n\nThese little moments of dissatisfaction just keep adding up, and it\u2019s clear that Syndergaard is not going to be treated like the top star on his own team, at least not with Jacob deGrom anchoring the Mets\u2019 rotation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis latest situation is the second time this season that Syndergaard\u2019s catcher of choice has become a topic. When Syndergaard returned from the injured list in late June, he let it known that he wanted to throw to Nido, the backup. He owns a 2.45 ERA throwing to Nido, compared to a 5.09 ERA with Ramos.\n\n\u201cIn terms of pitchers and catchers there is a certain \u2018it\u2019 factor,\u201d Syndergaard said of his drastic splits. \u201cThere\u2019s a relationship, like a symbiotic relationship that two guys can possess and all about being comfortable out there.\u201d\n\nThis past weekend, the Mets elected to have Nido start with Marcus Stroman on Saturday in hopes of getting him going since he catches the low ball better than Ramos. Stroman relies on his sinker, and pitches to the bottom of the zone.\n\nSyndergaard also prioritizes his two-seamer and pitches better low in the zone, but the Mets had Ramos catch Syndergaard.\n\nThat Nido is preferred to Ramos is not a sentiment exclusive to Syndergaard with others, including deGrom, also preferring the backup. Ramos tries his best and works hard behind the scenes, but his defensive metrics aren\u2019t pretty. The Mets signed the veteran for his bat, not his glove.\n\nThe difference between deGrom and Syndergaard, though, is deGrom has not let it affect him the way Syndergaard has, and he\u2019s made that pairing work. Syndergaard allowed four runs in five innings with Ramos on Sunday, and the Nido-Stroman pairing also backfired with Stroman yielding five runs in four innings.\n\n\u201cAs far as Wilson, I have nothing but respect for the guy, doesn\u2019t change our relationship between one another, he busts his ass every day, ultimate respect for him,\u201d Syndergaard said. \u201cMy main concern was having an open dialogue with the front office and coaching staff, and my initial frustration on why there are these extreme splits with different catchers, more so the matter is it\u2019s all on me.\u201d\n\nSyndergaard certainly seemed aware of the fact that the Mets are not allowing him to have a personal catcher one year after they allowed deGrom to have one. DeGrom mostly threw to Devin Mesoraco last year during his historic season.\n\nMets manager Mickey Callaway noted that the Mets had nothing to play for last year and deGrom deserved every chance to make a run at that individual award. This year, the Mets are in the race, and Ramos, despite his defensive flaws, has been one of baseball\u2019s best hitters in the second half.\n\nSyndergaard said watching deGrom and Mesoraco work together was like \u201cwatching Bob Ross painting\u201d but sees similarities to his situation this year with Nido.\n\n\u201cI completely agree,\u201d Syndergaard said of the connection.\n\nWhile a disagreement regarding a catcher may seem inconsequential, it\u2019s part of the broader picture in which the have been Mets shopping Syndergaard since last offseason, revealing how they truly feel about the righty.\n\nThey have let it be known that they are open to dealing Syndergaard despite his two-plus years of remaining team control, and are expected to shop him again this winter. It\u2019s understandable that a team would explore its options, but they could just as easily pursue a contract extension as a big-market team.\n\nContrast this approach to how the Mets never seemed inclined to trade deGrom, and gave him a contract extension with two full seasons left on his deal. They signaled they wanted to extend deGrom, and then backed it up. With Syndergaard, the Mets are eager to find out what they can receive in return.\n\nSyndergaard can be a handful at times, and has landed on the injured list in three straight seasons, but he\u2019s still one of the game\u2019s best No. 2 starters.\n\nThat the Mets are so open to moving Syndergaard has caused concern among teams interested in Syndergaard, per a source. Mets GM Brodie Van Wagenen used to be the co-head of CAA Baseball, and Syndergaard is a CAA Client, although Van Wagenen did not represent him. Van Wagenen, however, did represent deGrom.\n\nIt seemed quite revealing that Syndergaard had to be asked twice about his feelings on the Mets\u2019 front office before mentioning them.\n\nHe also is not pleased that the media learned of his meetings with the staff and Van Wagenen was leaked to the media, which is never a good sign since that can lead to distrust.\n\n\u201cUmm, as of right now, the 25, 40 guys in the clubhouse, those guys are my family,\u201d Syndergaard said in response to the first question.\n\nAfter a follow up, Syndergaard replied: \u201cUmm, as of right now, I respect each and every one of those (front office and ownership) guys. I really appreciated the open dialogue and conversation we had and hopefully we can grow out of it.\u201d\n\nSyndergaard is lined up to pitch Friday against the Dodgers at Citi Field. Unless the Mets sit Ramos twice in the next three days or in back-to-back games against Arizona, it seems Ramos, not Nido, will be catching him again.\n\nThe numbers certainly suggest that Syndergaard should be throwing to Nido, and it\u2019s clear there is a certain comfort level that is in play here \u2014 putting Syndergaard at ease and perhaps increasing the Mets\u2019 chances of winning. Four back in the NL wild card race entering Tuesday, they need every win they can get.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m under the impression when Mickey makes the lineup,\u201d Syndergaard said, \u201che\u2019s making the lineup to put the team in the best possible situation to win a game.\u201d\n\nIf this Mets season ends without any postseason ball, the rumors will start up in full force again regarding Syndergaard. Perhaps these will be his final few starts as a Met.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just working on becoming more consistent with whoever is behind the plate,\u201d Syndergaard said. \u201cGo out there and compete with whoever is behind the plate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Noah Syndergaard's future with the Mets seems murkier after Syndergaard expressed displeasure with his personal catcher situation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WGwlfbSR6HnQnw6Xemeaog--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UVlqUE1p0kVr16XVjP17sQ--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/9d1a7050-d418-11e9-bc3b-bef43dae9fd4", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
