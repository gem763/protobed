REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\nAt the first debate since Warren climbed into a virtual tie with former Vice President Joe Biden in many Democratic opinion polls, Warren was a repeated target for lower-tier contenders trying to stand out in the crowded Democratic White House pack.\n\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar went after Warren for being evasive on her plan for universal healthcare, saying it would mean higher taxes.\n\n\u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where to send the invoice,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar pushed back when Warren said critics of her wealth tax were trying to protect billionaires, saying: \u201cNo one on this stage wants to protect billionaires,\u201d adding: \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d\n\nButtigieg chided Warren, who boasts she has a plan for everything, for not releasing a detailed healthcare plan with an explanation of how she would fund it.\n\nThe sharp exchanges were a sign of the heightened stakes as a dozen candidates crammed the debate stage in the electoral battleground state of Ohio. It was the most crowded debate so far in the Democratic race to pick a challenger to Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.\n\nThe debate comes at a critical time, as Biden has seen his once solid lead in opinion polls in the Democratic race diminished by Warren, a leader of the party\u2019s progressive movement, who has steadily risen over the past two months.\n\nWarren stayed calm under the repeated attacks, offering her proposals to end income inequality and level the economic playing field for workers.\n\nShe said she would not sign any bill that does not lower healthcare costs for middle-class families.\n\n\u201cI have made clear what my principles are here, and that is that costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and, for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,\u201d she said.\n\nThe expansive Medicare for All proposal, based on the government-run healthcare plan for Americans over age 65, has sharply divided Democratic presidential contenders. Some analysts have said it would cost $32 trillion over a decade. Many other Democratic candidates back a Medicare-based plan as just one option for Americans seeking healthcare coverage.\n\nU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who sponsored a bill in the Senate to create a Medicare for All plan, said he thought it was \u201cappropriate to acknowledge that taxes would go up\u201d under the proposal.\n\nButtigieg plugged his plan for \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It,\u201d a proposal that Warren poked fun at.\n\n\u201cWhenever someone hears the term Medicare for All Who Want It, understand what that really means is Medicare for All Who Can Afford It,\u201d Warren said.\n\nU.S. Senator Cory Booker tried to stay out of the fight, and warned the Democrats against tearing one another down during the debates. He urged them to keep their eyes on the goal of beating Trump.\n\n\u201cI have seen this script before,\u201d Booker said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020.\u201d\n\nButtigieg and O\u2019Rourke clashed over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan for mandatory buybacks of assault weapons by the government. Buttigieg called it unrealistic, and fired back at O\u2019Rourke when he said it was time to stop listening to opinion polls and consultants and focus groups.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nBACKING IMPEACHMENT PROBE\n\nAt the first debate since Democrats in Congress launched an impeachment probe against Trump, the candidates defended the inquiry and said the president needed to be held accountable for his actions and for stonewalling Congress on its probe.\n\nThe investigation focuses on Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his unsubstantiated allegation that Biden improperly tried to aid his son Hunter\u2019s business interests in Ukraine.\n\nBiden and Sanders both said that Trump was \u201cthe most corrupt president in history,\u201d and that Congress would be remiss if it did not pursue the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences,\u201d Warren said.\n\nBiden said Trump was going after him because he did not want to face him in next year\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine and that\u2019s what we should be focused on,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhat I think is important is we focus on why it\u2019s so important to remove this man from office.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats warned that the party should bring Americans on board to support the probe. \u201cWe have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable,\u201d Booker said.\n\nMost of the Democrats criticized Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, which cleared the way for a Turkish incursion to attack the Kurds, longtime U.S. allies in the fight against Islamic State.\n\n\u201cLook, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way,\u201d Warren said.\n\nThe debate marked the return of Sanders, 78, the oldest candidate in the field, who suffered a heart attack two weeks ago and has been recuperating at home in Vermont since having stents inserted to open a blocked artery.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nThe health scare emphasized his age and that of the other top White House contenders - Biden is 76 and Warren is 70, while Trump is 73 - in a race featuring a debate about a generational change in leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all around this country,\u201d Sanders said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be back here with you.\u201d\n\nBiden said his age and experience were a positive in looking at his potential for the White House. \u201cWith it comes wisdom,\u201d he said.", "description": "Several Democratic presidential contenders launched an attack on surging U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren on healthcare and taxes during a debate on Tuesday, pushing her to explain how she would pay for ambitious proposals including her Medicare for All plan.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441338583&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F06R", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
