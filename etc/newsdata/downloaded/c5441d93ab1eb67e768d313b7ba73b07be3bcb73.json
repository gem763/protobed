It is not only yesterday and today. He is feeling the supporters don\u2019t like him.\n\n\u201cHis commitment with the club is a great commitment every time. He wants to help.\n\n\u201cHis behaviour was perfect in training, with the group and with the club. He knows he was wrong.\n\n\u201cHe was wrong and he feels it inside very deeply. But that is normal as a human.\u201d\n\nXhaka will not travel with Arsenal for Wednesday\u2019s League Cup tie at Liverpool.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Arsenal will offer counselling to Granit Xhaka after the Gunners captain found himself in trouble for swearing at his own fans,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/517d79_granit-xhaka-is-in-hot-water-swearing-arsenal-fans-arsenal-offer-xhaka-counselling-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
