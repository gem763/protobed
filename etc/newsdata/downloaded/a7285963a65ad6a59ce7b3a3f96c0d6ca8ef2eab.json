The question now is can the current government bring things back to where they were, and the signs look quite good on that.\"\n\nMr Nossal said mining companies working in Ecuador had re-organised the chamber of mines in Ecuador in a bid to make it a more effective champion for the industry.\n\nMr Nossal said Newcrest was not bound by the sort of standstill agreements that were temporarily preventing BHP from increasing its stake in SolGold, but there was no plan to acquire more of the company any time soon.\n\n''We are happy with our position for the time being. This is a long game for SolGold ... there is some time for this to play out,\" he said.", "description": "Political turbulence is affecting two of Newcrest's early stage projects in PNG and Ecuador.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.2156%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_122/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/49d1a7aa29f5c62ec8c12741751215720d1d8ebf", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
