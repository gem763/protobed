September, however, has come and gone and we\u2019re still waiting on Postmates to release the critical document.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we will IPO when we believe we find the right time for the business and the right time for the markets,\u201d Lehmann told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd if you look at the markets right now, I believe they are a little choppy. They are a little choppy when it comes to growth companies specifically \u2026 We are hopeful that we find a good window to get out there.\u201d\n\nLehmann made reference to Uber and other companies to recently float, citing market conditions as an IPO deterrent. Uber, Lyft, Slack and other fast-growing unicorns have struggled since entering the public markets earlier this year despite sky-high private market valuations. WeWork, a money-losing endeavor, recently decided to delay its IPO after demand from Wall Street devalued the business by the billions. Whether Postmates will complete its debut by the end of the year is unclear.\n\nPostmates confidentially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO in February. Shortly after, Postmates held M&A talks with DoorDash, another food delivery unicorn, according to people familiar with the matter, but failed to come to mutually favorable terms. DoorDash has previously declined to comment on these reports. On stage last week, Lehmann declined to confirm the reports.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it does any good to speculate on M&A,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you have four well-funded players here in the U.S. in this space. I think everyone is well aware of the strengths and the weaknesses of each other and you know at some point down the line, if we take Europe for example, you will see consolidation in the market. People have conversations all the time but I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it.\u201d\n\nPostmates operates its on-demand delivery platform, powered by a network of local gig economy workers, in more than 3,500 cities across all 50 states. The company does not yet operate in any international markets aside from Mexico City, however, Lehmann\u2019s comments suggest the business could be plotting a foray into Europe, where Deliveroo, Just Eat and others dominate the market.\n\nPostmates has raised about $900 million to date, including a $225 million round announced last month that valued the company at $2.4 billion. DoorDash, on the other hand, reached a $12.6 billion valuation in May with a $600 million Series G and has raised more than double that of Postmates. When asked why DoorDash, a similar and competing business, needed that much more capital, Lehmann joked \u201cMaybe [DoorDash CEO Tony Xu] needs a jet, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nPostmates, founded in 2011 by Lehmann, is backed by Spark Capital, Founders Fund, Uncork Capital, Slow Ventures, Tiger Global, Blackrock and others.
