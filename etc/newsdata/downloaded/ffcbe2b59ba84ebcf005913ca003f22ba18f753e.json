More than 1,000 U.S. forces are currently deployed in Syria, where they work closely with the Kurdish YPG, which leads the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nTurkey considers the Kurdish-led forces, which have proved to be the U.S.'s most effective allies in its fight against ISIS, to be a terrorist insurgency.\n\n\"These are the people who for the last four years have been fighting on our behalf, with our equipment to defeat ISIS, and they have done it with enormous efficacy, and they\u2019ve sacrificed immensely, and we basically just said to them, 'See ya,'\" the former Obama administration official said. \"And let the Turks, who are like the hungry wolf trying to kill the lamb, go for it.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It\u2019s just appalling because we promised the Kurds our partnership, and we promised them that if they worked with us to defeat our common enemy, then we would stand with them,\" she added. \"And Trump woke up on the wrong side of the bed it appears and decided never mind, which is why suddenly Republicans in Congress have gotten a pulse today.\"\n\nThe move from Trump showcased a clear split between the White House and some of the president's most outspoken supporters in the GOP.
