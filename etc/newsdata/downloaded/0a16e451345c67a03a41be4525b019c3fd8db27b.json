(Library of Congress via The New York Times)\n\nFor two weeks in August, a multimillion-dollar search from air, land and sea sought to solve the 80-year mystery of Amelia Earhart\u2019s disappearance.\n\nRobert Ballard, the ocean explorer famous for locating the wreck of the Titanic, led a team that discovered two hats in the depths. It found debris from an old shipwreck. It even spotted a soda can. What it did not find was a single piece of the Lockheed Electra airplane flown in 1937 by Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan, which vanished during their doomed voyage around the world.\n\nBallard and his crew don\u2019t consider it a failure. For one thing, he says, they know where the plane isn\u2019t. And in the process, they may have dispensed with one clue that has driven years of speculation, while a team of collaborating archaeologists potentially turned up more hints at the aviator\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cThis plane exists,\u201d Ballard said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Loch Ness monster, and it\u2019s going to be found.\u201d\n\nBallard had avoided the Earhart mystery for decades, dismissing the search area as too large, until he was presented with a clue he found irresistible. Kurt Campbell, then a senior official in President Barack Obama\u2019s State Department, shared with him what is known as the Bevington image \u2014 a photo taken by a British officer in 1940 at what is now known as Nikumaroro, an atoll in the Phoenix Islands in the Republic of Kiribati. American intelligence analysts had enhanced the image at Campbell\u2019s request and concluded a blurry object in it was consistent with landing gear from Earhart\u2019s plane.\n\nMotivated by this clue, and by 30 years of research on Nikumaroro by the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, Ballard and his crew set a course for the island in August. They were joined by archaeologists from the National Geographic Society, which sponsored and documented the journey for \u201cExpedition Amelia,\u201d which will air on the National Geographic Channel on Sunday.\n\nBallard and Allison Fundis, the Nautilus\u2019 chief operating officer, coordinated an elaborate plan of attack. First, they sent the ship five times around the island to map it with multibeam sonar and deployed a floating autonomous surface vehicle to map shallower areas off the island\u2019s shore. They also used four aerial drones for additional inspections of the surrounding reef.\n\nNikumaroro and its reef are just the tip of a 16,000-foot underwater mountain, a series of 13 sheer escarpments that drop off onto ramps, eventually fanning out at the base for 6 nautical miles.\n\nIf Earhart crashed there, they believe, rising tides would have dragged her plane over the reef and down the escarpments. Fragments should have collected on the ramps, especially heavier components like the engine and the radio.\n\nIn deeper water the team deployed the Hercules and the Argus, remotely operated vehicles equipped with spotlights and high-definition cameras. These robots descended 650 feet around the entire island and found nothing.\n\nAt that point, the crew focused on the northwest corner of the island near the S.S. Norwich City, a British freighter that ran aground on the island in 1929, eight years before Earhart\u2019s disappearance. That is the area where the Bevington photo was taken.\n\nWhile they searched there, crew members found so many beach rocks consistent in size and shape with the supposed landing gear in the Bevington image that it became a joke on the ship.\n\n\u201cOh look,\u201d Ballard would chuckle, \u201canother landing gear rock.\u201d\n\nFundis said, \u201cWe felt like if her plane was there, we would have found it pretty early in the expedition.\u201d But she said they kept up their morale because Ballard reminded them that it took four missions to find the Titanic and that one of those expeditions missed the ship by just under 500 feet.\n\nThe crew mapped the mountain\u2019s underwater drainage patterns and searched the gullies that might have carried plane fragments down slope, to a depth of 8,500 feet. Crew members even searched roughly 4 nautical miles out to sea in case the plane lifted off the reef intact and glided underwater as it sank.\n\nEach time a new search tactic yielded nothing, Ballard said, he felt he was adding \u201cnail after nail after nail\u201d to the coffin of the Nikumaroro hypothesis.\n\nStill, Ballard and Fundis confess that other clues pointing to Nikumaroro have left them with lingering curiosity about whether Earhart crashed there. For instance, Panamerican Airway radio direction finders on Wake Island; Midway Atoll; and Honolulu, Hawaii; each picked up distress signals from Earhart and took bearings, which triangulated in the cluster of islands that includes Nikumaroro.", "description": "For two weeks in August, a multimillion-dollar search from air, land and sea sought to solve the 80-year mystery of Amelia Earhart's disappearance.Robert Ballard, the ocean explorer famous for locating the wreck of the Titanic, led a team that discovered two hats in the depths.
