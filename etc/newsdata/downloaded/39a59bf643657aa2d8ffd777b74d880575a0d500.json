Photo: Vulture and Getty Images\n\nEach week, Vulture highlights the best new music. If a song is worthy of your ears and attention, you\u2019ll find it here. Listen to them all.\n\nSeptember may still be young, but the month has already brought about plenty of great music. Fresh tracks from Camila Cabello? A full Highwomen album? A new Grimes music video directed by Grimes? That\u2019s right \u2014 find all that, and a slew of other great artists, below.\n\nCamila Cabello, \u201cLiar\u201d\n\nThis week we got a very dark, very gooey Billie Eilish as a fallen angel and a naughty, angelic Camila Cabello. In a jazzy Latin track, Camila asks us to continue our Hot Girl Summer shenanigans into the fall. Camila wants you to make her a liar \u2014 she\u2019s begging you (it\u2019s either you or Shawn Mendes, and I choose to believe she\u2019s speaking to me, personally). The track is filled with very horny, saucy beats, as she sings about a steamy romance she\u2019s really \u201ctrying to avoid.\u201d Here\u2019s to hoping we get a sexy performance of this song on SNL this fall, horns and all. \u2014Clare Palo\n\nThe Highwomen, \u201cHighwomen\u201d\n\n\u201cHighwomen,\u201d the opener and cornerstone of country supergroup the Highwomen\u2019s self-titled debut, is a chilling montage of destruction. In five verses, vocalists Brandi Carlile, Amanda Shires, Yola, and Natalie Hemby take turns recounting the moment the life was snuffed out of an ambitious woman. Each story is more crushing than the last. After Carlile\u2019s character gets caught up in the Nicaraguan revolution, and Shires\u2019s New England mystic is hanged in Salem, Massachusetts, Yola plays a freedom fighter who risks everything to fight for equality, and Hemby embodies a preacher killed for daring to take a role in church leadership as a woman. Verse five is the kill shot: \u201cWe are the daughters of the silent generations / You send our hearts to die alone in foreign nations / It may return to us as tiny drops of rain / But we will still remain.\u201d\n\n\u201cHighwomen\u201d is a sister song to Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, and Waylon Jennings\u2019s 1985 single, \u201cHighwayman,\u201d which detailed \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d writer Jimmy Webb\u2019s lurid dream about a life on the run. Played by outlaw-country elders in a commercial lull, it is a word about resilience. The updated version scans over 300 years of oppression in less than four minutes, the message being that in spite of radical changes in the human experience, the main theme \u2014 people in power keeping other people out of power \u2014 endures. These women just wanted to live, love, and be loved, but the planet couldn\u2019t handle that. Coming from musicians working in an industry so hungry for fresh perspectives on gender that it\u2019s spawning singles like \u201cDifferent for Girls,\u201d \u201cWoman, Amen,\u201d \u201cSpeak to a Girl,\u201d \u201cWoman,\u201d \u201cGirl,\u201d \u201cWomen,\u201d and \u201cGirl in a Country Song,\u201d \u201cHighwomen\u201d is protest music. \u2014Craig Jenkins\n\nGrimes, \u201cViolence\u201d\n\nOn \u201cViolence,\u201d an abusive relationship is explored from the victim\u2019s perspective, its parasitic qualities intact. In the opening to the artist-directed video, Grimes kneels on marble steps clad in her signature dark-fairy attire reading The Art of War. An ancient Chinese treatise considered to be one of, if not the, oldest living military documents, The Art of War outlines 13 preeminent strategies, one chapter at a time. \u201cViolence\u201d will likely appear on Grimes\u2019s upcoming record, Miss_AnthropOcene, which the artist described as \u201ca concept album about the anthropomorphic Goddess of climate change.\u201d Will Grimes tackle the major ways in which we exploit nature on a song-by-song basis (\u00e0 la The Art of War) on her new album? Furthering this premise, \u201cViolence\u201d is a fitting first release. It introduces our characters, Miss_AnthropOcene and the Earth. The pair revel in their hedonistic ways: \u201cYou feed off hurting me \u2026 And I like it like that,\u201d sings Grimes, as spellbinding synths speak the language of mutual destruction. Listen if you like Taoism, Burning Man, and Arca. \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nCharli XCX ft. Clairo and Yaeji, \u201cFebruary 2017\u201d\n\nAt approximately the 1:58 mark, Charli XCX\u2019s new pop collaboration with Clairo and Yaeji gets so emotional I had to set my drink down to listen to it five more times over. The track starts off trippy and techno, a number you\u2019re definitely going to hear on a club playlist in the LES for the next six months, and fuses the electronic synths with an earnest apology letter. The three artists mourn the mistakes they made to their past lovers and ask for a reply to an apology text left on read (!!!). Charli pleads, \u201cHope you can forgive the things I\u2019ve done.\u201d But in the outro, things slow down, and the anxious determination for forgiveness goes soft. Korean-American electronic artist Yaeji gets intimate, sincerely asking, in Korean, if it\u2019s too late for another apology. If you\u2019re not already tuned in to Yaeji, and her collabs with Charli, get on that, stat. \u2014Clare Palo\n\nPom Pom Squad, \u201cCherry Blossom\u201d\n\nPom Pom Squad\u2019s latest lo-fi lullaby is giving me some strong Michelle Branch vibes that I don\u2019t want to fight off. \u201cCherry Blossom\u201d is a prime example of projectile word vomit as Mia Berrin blurts out delayed apologies (\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I made you carry all that weight\u201d), bittersweet memories (\u201cIt\u2019s hard to forget waking up to your face / On Tuesday mornings when I got to sleep in late\u201d), and wishful thinking (\u201cYou\u2019re gonna wanna be my friend one day\u201d) while reflecting on another unhealthy relationship. Even though she\u2019s made a mess of her raw feelings, there\u2019s still a level of control maintained with support from a steady guitar and bass. At the end, she calmly concludes with \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy with the choice you made\u201d like the nail that seals the coffin shut. \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nBrasstracks ft. Kyle Dion, \u201cProfessional\u201d\n\nLast week, Brasstracks slid into my Release Radar playlist with their latest track. Welcome \u201cProfessional,\u201d a song that\u2019s playful and easy on the ears. It features Brasstracks\u2019 signature mix of jazzy horns and R&B stylings. \u201cProfessional\u201d sounds suspiciously like a Bruno Mars song, and yet, collaborator Kyle Dion\u2019s funk-filled falsettos drip with sexual energy. (Mars\u2019s vocals do not.) Let this feel-good track quell your end-of-summer woes. \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nFriday, August 23\n\nTaylor Swift, \u201cI Forgot That You Existed\u201d\n\nThe diabolical laugh in the last chorus of Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cI Forgot That You Existed\u201d is my energy for 2019. Senseless cruelty is tough to grasp. You live with the immediate effects, the hurt and self-doubt that stew in your thoughts during the worst of it, but then you dwell on what motivates people to act on their worst impulses, to betray trust, to tear each other down. The letting go can be as bitter as the strike itself. The wondering why can cloud your mind long afterward, like the pervasive smell of smoke that follows a fire. The feeling is quite like having another person take up residence inside your head, soaking up time and emotional resources, just making you angry. \u201cI Forgot That You Existed,\u201d the opener to Taylor\u2019s new album, Lover, is about the day the fog lifts, when you manage to put enough time between your bad days and your present that they start to slip your mind. It\u2019s a great sentiment to kick off the album after Reputation, a recalibration that steers the artist in another direction without completely divorcing her preexisting catalogue. On that front, \u201cForgot\u201d is a success. \u2014Craig Jenkins\n\nCharlie Puth, \u201cI Warned Myself\u201d\n\nIf you broke Charlie Puth\u2019s heart, square up! On Wednesday, Charlie, with a buzz cut and that same beautifully scarred eyebrow, released his new single \u201cI Warned Myself.\u201d It is a song about love and loss, secrets and lies \u2014 basically a breakup. But Charlie knew better, warned himself, and hooked up with this woman anyway! \u201cI warned myself that I shouldn\u2019t play with fire,\u201d he sings. \u201cBut I can tell that I\u2019ll do it one more time / Don\u2019t trust in myself, no good for my health / You messed with my heart, now you\u2019re the reason why.\u201d Okay, but who exactly is the reason why? Was it his ex-girlfriend Halston Sage? Was it his old \u201cWe Don\u2019t Talk Anymore\u201d flame Selena Gomez? Was it this season\u2019s Chuck-Wendy conflict on Billions, a show Charlie has proved himself a fan of? CP Family, we await the results of your federal investigation. \u2014Hunter Harris\n\nMissy Elliott, \u201cThrow It Back\u201d\n\nRejoice: Missy Elliott has released a new mixtape, Iconology, and a new video to go with. \u201cThrow It Back\u201d imagines my greatest fear (people have forgotten about Missy \u201cMisdemeanor\u201d Elliott) and hope (there is a museum dedicated to her). We\u2019re then treated to a panoply of good old-fashioned Missy weirdness. Bald backup dancers; Missy on the moon, jumping rope with braids; and enough wild lipstick colors to go around. \u2014Bethy Squires\n\nLana Del Rey, \u201cFuck it I love you\u201d\n\nI had the honor of being in Los Angeles when this big mood dropped, which only enhanced my listening experience as I deeply tapped into Lana\u2019s golden state-tinted mindset. As I made my way through the hills from West Hollywood to Echo Park, I was tempted by the fantasy of missing my flight back to New York and completely uprooting my lifestyle in favor of this sun-kissed bliss. When you spend a whole afternoon streaming a song on loop, it changes you. Please bury me in the sand, Lana. \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nThe 1975, \u201cPeople\u201d\n\nYouth is a feeling most of us forget. It gets ripped out from us as life becomes more about tasks, responsibilities, consumption, and capitalism. We forget what it\u2019s like to feel young. We infantilize the idea of it. We think they have it easy, that we know better. We don\u2019t. This week, the 1975 have made their second plea to listen to the youth (their first came via activist Greta Thunberg and their last single) and they\u2019ve done so by bottling the sound of adolescence; the sound of confusion, of anger, of energy so suffocating it has to be screamed out for fear it will rupture the organs that keep you breathing. \u201cWake up!\u201d shouts Matthew Healy, waking his younger self up, too. The 1975 have often talked an angry game but they\u2019ve never sounded this angry. They are so angry that they\u2019ve made a punk song. A straight-up Sex Pistols/Sonic Youth anti-fascist, pro-youth, big ol\u2019 shout-y anthem that wishes to make as much noise as possible, because if you can\u2019t be happy with the status quo, at least you can find your purpose. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nFinneas, \u201cShelter\u201d\n\nIn one day, Finneas gave us a headlining tour schedule, an EP announcement, and a brand-new song. \u201cShelter,\u201d the first single from his upcoming Blood Harmony, is a \u201cfeverish\u201d love song written long before he was touring the world with his sister, Billie Eilish (and knocking Lil Nas X off his horse with their co-produced \u201cbad guy\u201d). \u201cI wrote this song a couple years ago and just let it percolate for a while, seeing how it would age,\u201d Finneas said of \u201cShelter.\u201d \u201cI wanted this song to have an urgency to it when I recorded it, the same way that the lyrics do \u2014 the kind of feverish feeling that accompanies loving someone.\u201d He sings urgently over a collection of drums, hand claps, and acoustic beats, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna think about a life without you \u2026 I don\u2019t wanna go to war, but I\u2019m about to / Give me, give me shelter, from the storm.\u201d It\u2019s not quite as melancholic as his previous releases, but there seems to be trouble on the horizon as he claims, \u201cThey call us lucky, but I think we might be cursed.\u201d Still, it\u2019s his most danceable release yet, and you can bet the energy will be just as feverish when Finneas performs \u201cShelter\u201d on tour. \u2014Daise Bedolla\n\nBrockhampton, \u201cSUGAR\u201d\n\nBless this beautiful Friday. Brockhampton\u2019s fifth studio album Ginger, released just a year after Iridescence, is a soft banger, filled with hard rap hits and thoughtful, unconventional R&B tracks. Their track \u201cSUGAR,\u201d which features four of the group\u2019s members, was released prior to the group\u2019s album drop and is easily one of the best songs on the album. It\u2019s a perfect song to end a very heated hot gal summer. Ryan Beatty opens the song with the chorus, an anxious confessional to a crush, divulging that he just can\u2019t sleep without this person on his mind, and he needs answers, now! which \u2026 same. Don McLennon and Matt Champion spit two verses of unapologetic raps on an otherwise confused and melancholy song. Our favorite empath, (one the group\u2019s best singer-songwriters) bearface promises his love is real, but fades out the song with \u201cdo you love me?\u201d It\u2019s a fair question, bearface. Towards the end of the track Kevin Abstract (yes, I know just his name gets you hot) chimes in on the bridge, rapping once again about \u2026 passports. They\u2019re really hard to get, so we understand the fascination. \u2014Clare Palo\n\nslenderbodies, \u201carrival\u201d\n\nWake up, drive to the beach, iron out some melodies, rinse, and repeat. At a dinner party in Williamsburg, band members Max Vehuni and Benji Cormack outline the daily routine that went into the making of their upcoming album, komorebi, due in September. The California-based musicians started playing music together in college under the moniker slenderbodies, a name that bears no connection to the creepypasta meme, but rather, \u201cimplies a light, airy feel while also being grounded.\u201d The band produces soundscapes: music that feels like an extension of nature. On \u201carrival,\u201d Vehuni and Cormack\u2019s spellbinding vocals float over a looping electric guitar bit, creating an ethereal vibe reminiscent of alt-J\u2019s \u201c3WW.\u201d The band started writing the song by asking, \u201cIf you could immediately communicate with someone who was just born, what would you say to them?\u201d Writing over email, the band supplies one version: \u201cOverall, enjoy the highs and lows of life, welcome the awe of nature, fill your life with those you love, let the light in, accept things as they come and see them through.\u201d \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nFriday, August 16\n\nMiley Cyrus, \u201cSlide Away\u201d\n\nCyrus\u2019s \u201cSlide Away\u201d manages to feel quiet and intimate without any flatness. Producers Mike WiLL Made It and Andrew Wyatt mix hip-hop drums, warm guitars, sweeping strings, and layered samples as Miley eulogizes her marriage to actor Liam Hemsworth, a split made public mere days ago as rumors swirl that the singer is seeing Brody Jenner\u2019s ex Kaitlynn Carter. \u201cSlide Away\u201d isn\u2019t vindictive or tabloid-y. It\u2019s just about knowing when to cut your losses and move on. The music suits Miley\u2019s voice, pushing her without overwhelming her. The mix doesn\u2019t sound like anything else from this decade; this is the kind of record the gifted British singer-songwriters landed on at the end of the \u201990s, when everyone started jet-setting around genres and playing with samples. It\u2019s much more like Blur\u2019s \u201cTender\u201d or the Verve\u2019s \u201cBittersweet Symphony\u201d than anything on Bangers, Dead Petz, or Younger Now. It\u2019s a fitting end to a ten-year period of wild swings and big changes for Miley to find sturdy middle ground between jibing her interests and making a record that sounds like all of her, all at once. Time will tell. \u2014Craig Jenkins\n\nTaylor Swift, \u201cLover\u201d\n\n\u201cLover\u201d is the ideological inverse of her first two Lover singles, a song about shutting out the world and shacking up with a significant other one assumes to be her boyfriend of three years, Joe Alwyn, presumably for the long run. It\u2019s the quietest music to come out of her collaboration with pop producer Jack Antonoff since Reputation\u2019s closing piano ballad \u201cNew Years Day.\u201d The smoky low end is reminiscent of \u201990s country and country-adjacent gems like the Cowboy Junkies\u2019 cover of Lou Reed\u2019s \u201cSweet Jane,\u201d or Mazzy Star\u2019s \u201cFade Into You,\u201d but in burying pretty piano and guitar notes under a hokey walking bass line in the interest of effecting a slow build, \u201cLover\u201d doesn\u2019t take flight until the last chorus. \u2014Craig Jenkins\n\nNormani, \u201cMotivation\u201d\n\nNormani \u201cThat Bitch\u201d Kordei\u2019s new single \u201cMotivation\u201d is deservedly being overshadowed by its terrific video, an homage to 2000s R&B (namely, Beyonc\u00e9), from which Normani draws pretty much the entirety of her influences. But don\u2019t sleep on the song. One of the best things Normani has done since departing Fifth Harmony was find mentorship in Ariana Grande (Normani opened for Ari\u2019s Sweetener tour). Ariana has since loaned Normani her MV director (Dave Meyers), producers (Max Martin, Savan, and Ilya), and even her own pen (she has a co-writer credit on the single). The result is \u201cMotivation,\u201d a loose \u201cCheck on It\u201d remake that plays to all of Normani\u2019s (many) strengths with its layered, honeyed vocals and light feel. Its nostalgic simplicity is nostalgic in that way \u2014 going back to the basics of the genre suits Normani well. (And because it\u2019s fun to play this game, please note: While Camila Cabello has been sold as the Beyonc\u00e9 of 5H, here\u2019s Normani cheekily naming her single after one of Kelly Rowland\u2019s best. We see you.) \u2014Dee Lockett\n\nBig Thief, \u201cNot\u201d\n\nLast September in Long Beach, Big Thief were playing a mid-afternoon slot at a festival to an unfamiliar crowd. The more songs they played, the closer the audience moved toward the four-piece, and with that, more Big Thief fans were converted. They are a traveling band in every sense, hawking their gorgeous songs about tiny and enormous catastrophes from pillar to post. On that day in Long Beach, they played \u201cNot.\u201d I\u2019d never heard it before, and its verses, choruses, and epic guitar solos floored me so much that I went home and combed through their back catalogue, including the works of vocalists Adrianne Lenker and Buck Meek, desperate to find it. But no dice. Until now. \u201cNot\u201d is a surprise release this week, accompanied by a surprise announcement that Big Thief have a second album due in 2019 (as if U.F.O.F. wasn\u2019t spellbinding enough) following a past pattern of releasing two albums in quick succession. This just might be their finest song ever \u2014 adding to their catalogue of near supernatural excellence. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nRosal\u00eda and Ozuna, \u201cYo x Ti, Tu x Mi\u201d\n\nAfter her wildly successful collab with J Balvin and El Guincho on \u201cCon Altura,\u201d it was only a matter of time before Rosal\u00eda released another urbano single. And it\u2019s finally here in the form of \u201cYo x Ti, Tu x Mi,\u201d her first duet with Ozuna \u2014 and her sixth single this year alone. Translated from Spanish as \u201cMe for You, You for Me,\u201d \u201cYo x Ti, Tu x Mi\u201d sees the Catalonian singer and the Puerto Rican rapper and singer combine reggeaton and flamenco (along with some steel drums) for a flirty back-and-forth. \u201cSe me para el cora\u2019 s\u00f3lo con mirarte / Porque a ti te canto pa\u2019 que t\u00fa me cantes\u201d (My heart stops just looking at you / Because I sing to you so that you sing to me), they sing to each other. The flirting continues in their lavish music video, directed by Cliqua, RJ Sanchez, and Pasqual Gutierrez. Clad in a pink fur coat, a flower helmet (no flower crowns here, thank you), rhinestone-studded nails, and a floral bodysuit throughout the video, Rosal\u00eda cozies up to Ozuna as they face the paparazzi\u2019s cameras together. It doesn\u2019t have the infectious bite of \u201cCon Altura,\u201d but we\u2019re also not at the height of summer anymore. \u201cYo x Ti, Tu x Mi\u201d is a love song to lead you into the fall. \u2014Daise Bedolla\n\nShura, \u201cSkyline, Be Mine\u201d\n\nThe final track from Shura\u2019s new album Forevher, released today, is so flighty it will send you levitating above its pattering drums, whirling synths, and deep bass lines. It suits the fact that the song is an ode to the New York skyline, capturing a moment of throwing open the curtains and staring out at the man-made beauty of those tall towers stacked proudly next to one another. Shura\u2019s second record was written during a time in which she relocated from London to Brooklyn. She also fell in love in that time. This chorus is lyrically sparser than the rest of the record, but it\u2019s all said in the instrumentation. You can hear her heart swell as the body of it builds. It\u2019ll remind you of Moon Safari\u2013era Air, or early-2000s Zero 7 and Boards of Canada \u2014 a throwback to ambient electronica. Chill, sophisticated, high as a kite. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nMUNA, \u201cStayaway\u201d\n\nI share a few things with the powerhouse trio that is Muna, among them a love of Y2K fashion and a scandalized alma mater. I\u2019ve been quietly following the group since 2015, from backyard performances in Los Angeles to their breakout EP About U. Their latest release, \u201cStayaway,\u201d might be my favorite track to date. Grounded in emotional reality, \u201cStayaway\u201d kicks off with a series of hypotheses that pick up speed as the song progresses, mirroring the pace at which anxiety supersedes logic. \u201cIf I see my old friends, we\u2019ll go out dancing. If we go out dancing, then we\u2019ll go to the bar. If we go to the bar, then there\u2019s gonna be drinking. If I drink I\u2019ll want to see where you are. So I don\u2019t see my old friends, I don\u2019t go dancing, I don\u2019t do most things I used to do. Actually, now that I\u2019m thinking about it, I did most things to get to you.\u201d The chorus provides a much-needed release, accompanied by an acute realization: Breaking the habit is often harder than breaking up. \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\n(Sandy) Alex G, \u201cNear\u201d\n\nThe Porches\u2019 influence is so strong on this one, there\u2019s truly nothing anyone could tell me to change my mind! I dare to ask this question for the room: When is the last time that someone told you, \u201cAll I want is to be near you\u201d? Now that I\u2019ve had a few days to mediate on it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure. Alex G, you got me again. \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nFriday, August 9\n\nMegan Thee Stallion ft. Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla Sign, \u201cHot Girl Summer\u201d\n\nGod, in Her divine wisdom, could not have prepared me for the Megan Thee Stallion\u2013Nicki Minaj collab. Alongside Ty Dolla Sign, they\u2019ve flipped City Girls\u2019 \u201cAct Up\u201d into the song of the summer. It\u2019s all brash, ebullient fun, the kind of music to keep on repeat, to play during the pregame, to make you blush on your way into work Monday morning. (Also: the incredible generosity of this trio to release it on my birthday. Their minds!) The Hot Girl Summer gospel has gone global \u2014 coffee shops in Williamsburg have etched it on their chalkboards to be cute \u2014 but this record is a welcome reminder of the movement\u2019s roots: \u201cI can\u2019t read your mind, gotta say that shit,\u201d Meg raps. \u201cShould I take your love? Should I take that dick?\u201d Send my regards to every boy I\u2019m not texting back: Meg and Nicki said it\u2019s a hot girl summer! \u2013 Hunter Harris\n\nLana Del Rey, \u201cLooking for America\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent the past week shell-shocked and emotionally battered by the country\u2019s continued descent into terroristic gun-toting madness \u2026 this song won\u2019t stop the tears from flowing. Which is fine. This is a time to cry and mourn and feel the exhaustion, but to also channel the pain into action. Lana Del Rey took a flight back from Montecito, phoned her producer Jack Antonoff, and immediately hit the studio to process her feelings about the multiple massacres over the weekend. The result is \u201cLooking for America,\u201d continuing a streak of excellent songwriting from Lana. She typically has deep affection for the past, particularly as it relates to American iconography and patriotism, but \u201cLooking for America\u201d can\u2019t be nostalgic for an America that has never existed. This is a rare moment where Lana, as a voice of reason, is looking ahead: \u201cI\u2019m still looking for my own version of America / One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly.\u201d It\u2019s not what America was or is; Lana sees what America can be. I hope she\u2019s right. \u2014Dee Lockett\n\nThe Big Moon, \u201cIt\u2019s Easy Then\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so bored of being capable,\u201d sings Juliette Jackson over a bed of piano chords. It\u2019s her first statement, and a returning one at that, on her band The Big Moon\u2019s comeback. And significantly it apes the reach of the band\u2019s creative choices on this song. They\u2019ve put the instruments away that defined their initial success, for now. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for the piano to fall,\u201d she continues, before her bandmates chime in on a beautifully harmonized chorus, lifting her from her doubts and stress. The Big Moon are typically a twangy-based indie fourpiece from London. They experienced the type of success on their debut LP that most pub-dwelling British bands could only dream of, including a prestigious Mercury prize nomination. The test for such bands is always in proving that they have more tricks up their sleeve. On \u201cIt\u2019s Easy Then\u201d they immediately throw the baby out with the bathwater. It follows in the great British traditions of Britpop bands who didn\u2019t fear a lofty arrangement, a full breakdown, or both! They make it look like a breeze but it\u2019s anything but. \u2013Eve Barlow\n\nCashmere Cat, \u201cEMOTIONS\u201d\n\nMaybe I\u2019ve been watching too much Euphoria, but this song would have been perfect for any of the scenes where the teens are high out of their minds. The thought of being that reckless gives me hives, but there\u2019s something to be said about feeling so strongly about things with a sense of urgency. I haven\u2019t listened to Cashmere Cat in what has surely been years, but this single reminded me why I was drawn to his music way back when I was in college, how it made me want to escape to the nearest dance floor for a few hours of peace in motion. This should be you after listening to \u201cEmotions\u201d for the first time. \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nHana Vu, \u201cAt the Party\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the after-party, the 19-year-old artist sits on the floor wearing a deadpan expression. A smartphone-shaped fixture on her forehead activates a flashback; captured scenes from the night before play, preserved by technology\u2019s gaze. \u201cDo you care? Does it make you fall in love with me?\u201d our protagonist asks, analyzing read receipts and blurred signals. No, this isn\u2019t a Black Mirror episode; it\u2019s a music video. \u201cAt the Party\u201d is an evocapop anthem, fueled by icy synths and Vu\u2019s dark lower register. Her upcoming double EP, Nicole Kidman / Anne Hathaway, is out in October. We\u2019ll be here drowning in our feels until then. \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nFriday, August 2\n\nHaim, \u201cSummer Girl\u201d\n\nHaim have consistently been a band about joy \u2014 joy for the love of music, which they are dedicated students of. Eldest sister Este studied Ethnomusicology at UCLA. Middle sister Danielle only just graduated high school before going on the road with Julian Casablancas\u2019s band. Youngest sister Alana barely even applied to colleges, so certain that she was going to be in a band with her sisters. In music, they find happiness. In music, they escape indulging life\u2019s suffering. \u201cSummer Girl\u201d is probably their most joyous song, and perhaps their most sophisticated, and yet comes from the darkest place. It\u2019s trickier to do happy sophisticated than sad. It\u2019s bold. So Haim turn to the masters. This time it\u2019s Lou Reed.\n\n\u201cSummer Girl,\u201d their first release since 2017 album Something to Tell You, is inspired by one of the best pop songs of all time: \u201cWalk On The Wild Side.\u201d It\u2019s perfect, given Haim grew up in the \u201990s, as much influenced by the rhythmic world of hip-hop giants such as A Tribe Called Quest as they would have been by New York \u201970s punk. With a jazzy saxophone line and a \u201cdoot-doo-doo\u201d chorus, sung as though reaching for a familiar tune, the trio do not hide from the fact. The lyrics tease: \u201cWalk beside me, not behind me.\u201d The song\u2019s joy is also in its purposefulness. As Danielle explained in a social media post, the song began to come together as a little ode to cheer her partner (and its co-producer Ariel Rechtshaid) while she was on the road and he was at home sick with cancer. That\u2019s pop\u2019s best power: It can lift the spirits. It can provide a smile through struggle. It can bring sun to gray skies. It can reignite your faith in love when all you want to do is cry. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nAngel Olsen, \u201cAll Mirrors\u201d\n\nWhen I was in high school, I was obsessed with \u201980s movies \u2014 specifically films directed by John Hughes. I felt so seen in the narratives of misfits that refused to conform to the status quo, desperate to fast-forward to the next stage of their young adult lives where they would be accepted as their truest selves. Angel Olsen\u2019s \u201cAll Mirrors\u201d feels like putting yourself into that type of cinematic experience as soon as the \u201980s synths arrive, although it\u2019s probably more fitting for a title like Donnie Darko. In a press statement, she revealed that the swooping ballad is about \u201cowning up to your darkest side, finding the capacity for new love and trusting change even when you feel like a stranger.\u201d The accompanying visual depicts a women lost in a labyrinth, forced to face all of her selves in order to evolve into the person the universe has always destined her to be. Gah, the minds of women are so powerful! \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nAlchemist and Schoolboy Q, \u201cW.Y.G.D.T.N.S\u201d\n\nRap music moves faster than we can process it. Styles and flows pop up, get imitated, and then disappear before we even have time to decide if they\u2019re played out or not. It\u2019s one of the best things about rap \u2014 a genre that will never not be creatively fertile, will never become stale, and will always be pushing boundaries. Because of this perpetual forward movement, fans are always looking for the next thing. It\u2019s why, not 24 hours after Kendrick Lamar released DAMN., rumors began circulating that Kendrick was going to drop another surprise album imminently. Of course, he did not do that. It would have been ridiculous and unnecessary. On this collaboration with the producer Alchemist \u2014 who is just at adept at creating hardcore New York rap instrumentals as he is jazzy, sipping-beers-at-sunset-while-passing-around-a-blunt tracks like \u201cW.Y.G.D.T.N.S\u201d \u2014 Schoolboy Q skewers our obsessive need for more (W.Y.G.D.T.N.S. stands for When You Gonna Drop That New Shit), but more importantly, he talks a bunch of shit, talks about a bunch of bad and crazy stuff that has happened in America, and oscillates between muttered thoughts, stream-of-consciousness digressions, and a brief foray into the biting growl that has become his signature. At first, it feels like an outro, but it quickly becomes something more than a throwaway capstone. It\u2019s a track that plays with time and expectations and comes out the other side as a compelling collaboration between two rap greats. \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nStarcrawler, \u201cBet My Brains\u201d\n\nAn earlier Vulture profile describes Starcrawler\u2019s \u201cscuzzy glam that evokes the teensploitation films of the 1970s and that decade\u2019s street-level Hollywood depravity.\u201d You may recognize their sound from Jason Clarke\u2019s 2019 adaptation of Pet Sematary; a film I am personally triggered by, as someone whose childhood bedroom looked out upon a \u201cgarden\u201d of Dead Petz (including one albino guinea pig named Chloe). The young pop-punk band is known for their high-octane live performances and their simultaneously zany and disquieting music videos; the group\u2019s latest release \u201cBet My Brains\u201d is no exception. In the video, lead singer Arrow de Wilde makes clown makeup great again while practicing her exorcist routine. Meanwhile, the boys look like they ambushed a Depop store. They seem cool. \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nBrockhampton, \u201cI Been Born Again\u201d\n\nEven when Brockhampton makes low-key or overwhelmingly dark tracks, the rap group that has decided to call themselves a boy band tends to lean cartoony. Usually this manifests in brightly colored videos, or moments of childlike exuberance. \u201cI Been Born Again,\u201d which is accompanied by a black-and-white video of the members rolling around and doing pushups on some sidewalk somewhere, is relatively subdued, and not cartoony at all. Instead it seems designed to rebuke those who felt like Brockhampton were riding the boy-band gimmick too hard \u2014 this is purely a strong, unflashy mid-album rap track recontextualized as a single. It\u2019s vibe music, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that. \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nFriday, July 26\n\nTaylor Swift, \u201cThe Archer\u201d\n\nThis is called growth, people (*signals Kelly from Insecure\u2019s growth hand gesture*). Taylor Swift\u2019s melodic new single, \u201cThe Archer,\u201d is one of the most self-aware tracks from the songstress yet. Finally, finally Taylor will let her guard down and rest \u2014 fighting is so exhausting. Part of the thing with therapy and healing is acceptance \u2014 acceptance that you can be \u201cthe archer\u201d and also \u201cthe prey\u201d and look at your mistakes just as critically as your enemies, and finally heal. In addition to the song sounding eerily like Reputation\u2019s \u201cDelicate,\u201d we are also blessed with some Old World Taylor imagery: As her anxiety envelops her she sings, \u201cI wake in the night, I pace like a ghost, The room is on fire, invisible smoke.\u201d In the bridge, Taylor self-actualizes, \u201cThey see right through me \u2026 Can you see right through me? \u2026 I see right through me.\u201d This must have been a breakthrough during her therapeutic songwriting sessions, or at least we hope so. Here\u2019s to hoping the rest of the album is as honest as \u201cThe Archer.\u201d \u2014Clare Palo\n\nChance the Rapper feat. Death Cab for Cutie, \u201cDo You Remember\u201d\n\nWell, the summer of features has come to this: Chance\u2019s long-anticipated album, The Big Day, has just dropped, and the second track features none other than \u2026 Ben Gibbard? Yes, Ben Gibbard! The Death Cab for Cutie frontman, employing his unmistakable, soulful whine while presumably wearing a \u201c3\u201d cap over his floppy hair, sings: \u201cDo you remember how when you were younger/The summers all lasted forever?\u201d Gibbard is the archer and I am the prey; the line pierces me the way The Photo Album did my sensitive 16-year-old self all those years ago. Chance, of course, is excellent on the track as well, romantically remembering days past (velcro shoes) and not-so-past (Will Smith as Genie). The song melts various memories into one long summer \u2014 perhaps, even, 500 days of them? \u2014Ray Rahman\n\nThe 1975, \u201cThe 1975\u201d\n\nYou wonder if Matthew Healy likes being the \u201cmillennial that baby boomers like\u201d (the lyric from last year\u2019s \u201cGive Yourself A Try\u201d). It\u2019s the most powerful position. He has a diverse captive audience at the bottom of his pulpit and he\u2019s not about to waste it. In the great tradition of rock and roll, his band \u2014 the 1975 of Manchester, England \u2014 has reached the point at which they all want to put causes first, because last year\u2019s A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships certainly proved that they matter musically, that they matter culturally, and that people are listening. Unlike the great tradition of rock and roll, they\u2019re not interested in cashing in on what could be their most defining moment as they prepare to release their next effort, Notes on a Conditional Form, this year. The 1975 have done the punk-becomes-pop thing, they\u2019ve done the narcissist-in-crisis thing, and now they\u2019re doing the everything\u2019s-fucked-so-we-may-as-well-save-the-world thing.\n\nNotes on a Conditional Form then begins as all their other albums do \u2014 with a track titled \u201cThe 1975.\u201d Except this time, the 1975 don\u2019t take the lead. Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old climate-change activist, does. I was sent this a week before its release while in a mire of extreme anxiety about a whole load of personal nonsense that doesn\u2019t actually matter. When I listened to what Thunberg had to say, when I heard the way the 1975 were engaging with their audiences, when I imagined Matthew Healy giving his stage to another leader half his age because she believes that we still have time to make a difference, it actually calmed me down. All the money acquired from this song will go to the climate-change movement Extinction Rebellion, and the instruction is that we all \u201cwake up!\u201d There\u2019s work to do. Let\u2019s do it. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nDIIV, \u201cSkin Game\u201d\n\nWhile I\u2019m fully aware that the phrase \u201ceverything was beautiful and nothing hurt\u201d was meant to be ironic during the Tumblr era, I feel like we as a society are only now facing the reality that so many of us are suffering in silence. But people don\u2019t have to hide alone in their pain anymore; you can find support through the struggle, and that\u2019s the beauty of \u201cSkin Game.\u201d For me, the most chilling line is \u201cHolding in coughs, hiding my head/ Everybody respects the dead\u201d \u2014 it reminds me of all the lives that were lost too soon from overdoses. (RIP Mac Miller and Lil Peep.) DIIV\u2019s forthcoming album, Deceiver, delves into the vicious cycle of addiction and unpacks the many dimensions of the disease. There\u2019s no better time to open the dialogue; this subject is extremely relevant. \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nPJ Morton, \u201cReady\u201d\n\n\u201cMany people thought I was done. Part of this documentary is to show everybody that I\u2019m not done. Working on this new record in the mountains and it\u2019s my best work. I\u2019ve been so focused. Not just physically, you can see that, it\u2019s crystal clear, but it\u2019s not just about that. I\u2019m a musician \u2026 We\u2019re going to touch everybody, I mean, babies, grandmothers, teenagers, twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, forty-somethings as well, fifty-somethings, black, red, yellow, white, green, blue, purple. Especially purple, we\u2019re going to touch a lot of the purples. I think this is going to be a worldwide phenomenon.\u201d So begins the spoken introduction to \u201cReady\u201d before launching into tropical funk. \u201cGirl let me take you on a journey,\u201d PJ Morton implores his love interest to go steady. The New Orleans artist and songwriter passes the test with aplomb. May you finish your summer with the same confidence. \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nFriday, July 19\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 ft. Jay-Z and Childish Gambino, \u201cMOOD 4 EVA\u201d\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s hardest bar, her greatest line, her sickest burn, is just her reciting her government name: \u201cI am Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter,\u201d releasing every syllable with a snarl, like a threat and a promise all at once. (Obviously, she follows that by listing her royal r\u00e9sum\u00e9: \u201cI am the Nala, sister of Yoruba / Oshun, Queen Sheba, I am the mother.\u201d) Beyonc\u00e9 on \u201cMOOD 4 EVA\u201d is the mother I never had. (To both my actual mother and Laurie Metcalf in Lady Bird: Please don\u2019t read this.) She is the sister everybody would want. She is the friend everybody deserves. I don\u2019t know a better person. I don\u2019t know a better person! \u2014Hunter Harris\n\nVivian Girls, \u201cSick\u201d\n\nAnd now for an indie-rock reunion that doesn\u2019t feel like cheap nostalgia, or a maladroit play for your wallet. Vivian Girls, disciples of the 2000s noise-pop implosion, took their love of joyful girl-group harmonies, the Ramones, and bright, blown-out guitar fuzz and transformed into extraordinary mp3 blog fodder. Except, of course, their songs were timeless compared to the forgettable riffing that dominated New York City warehouse venues and college radio in 2009, and as women in a DIY network ruled by dudes, they were progenitors of whatever progress the space has encountered in the years since their disbandment. \u201cSick\u201d is the lead single from their forthcoming full-length, Memory, their first LP in eight years, and it\u2019s as if no time has passed \u2014 but it has, and they\u2019ve simply aged into it. If \u201cSick\u201d is any indication, Vivian Girls\u2019 sound is still a hodgepodge of all their musical touchstones, indecipherable beneath the haze, continuously confronting and morphing into something much, much grander. \u2014Maria Sherman\n\nWilco, \u201cLove Is Everywhere (Beware)\u201d\n\nWhat an effortlessly breezy and beautiful new song from Chicago greats Wilco, whose 14th(!) studio album, Ode to Joy, is due out this fall. Jeff Tweedy & Co. typically work in two amorphous modes: tuneful, melodic folk-rock and the type of left-field experimental alchemy that made 2000s classic Yankee Hotel Foxtrot so striking. On \u201cLove Is Everywhere (Beware),\u201d they\u2019re firmly in the former mode, with a spindly and hypnotic guitar line oscillating behind Tweedy\u2019s hushed vocals \u2014 like a stone skipping across a lake, gently disruptive in its meditative calm. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nCharli XCX and Christine and the Queens, \u201cGone\u201d\n\nBritish pop fiend Charli XCX has become as much a purveyor of taste as she has a pop star in her own right. Her forthcoming third album, Charli, is all about finding strength in collaboration, and \u201cGone\u201d is inarguably her greatest collaboration to date. \u201cGone\u201d manages to capture the qualities of both artists without dwindling either. It\u2019s an ideal marriage \u2014 an ox of a song that serves to house and protect both of their struggles. On \u201cGone,\u201d Charli and Chris separately bleat about disappointment in human relationships, about the solitude of needing to rely on yourself. It\u2019s perhaps a comfort to them that they are aligned in this experience. Yet aside from their adjacent narrative, there\u2019s nothing they can do to free each other from these shackles \u2014 or indeed the ropes they\u2019re tied to a car in the song\u2019s sensationally autoerotic video. That adds to the tension and release of the track\u2019s titanic production. Its drums sound like fireworks being set off inside a closed steel container. That\u2019s how it feels to be terrified to speak the truth, and yet also incapable of letting those truths eat you up inside. \u201cI feel so unstable, fucking hate these people / How they\u2019re making me feel lately,\u201d sings Charli, in her most vulnerable state ever. Chris\u2019s open-wound songwriting has clearly rubbed off on Charli, while Charli\u2019s zero-fucks-given aspirational vision has lent Chris her hardest floor-filler yet. \u201cGone\u201d is the song to beat this year. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\n(Sandy) Alex G, \u201cHope\u201d\n\n(Sandy) Alex G\u2019s \u201cHope\u201d begins with a few devastating short lines: \u201cHe was a good friend of mine / he died / why write about it now? / Gotta honor him somehow / Saw some people crying that night / Yeah, Fentanyl took a few lives from our life / Alright.\u201d It\u2019s a brilliant moment that manages to capture the frustration of facing down death, the helplessness that gives way to hope, and the loneliness that comes with being consumed by shock and grief. \u201cHope\u201d is one of many excellent songs by (Sandy) Alex G, who has gone from bedroom artist to collaborating with Frank Ocean, but it stands out as maybe his best to date for the way he plays the somberness of the lyrics off an almost bouncy acoustic-guitar strum, making for a sort of covertly sad listening experience. The song closes with the residents of a house calling out the name of their dead friend, throwing bottles out the window. It\u2019s a snapshot of American life and American death and it\u2019s beautiful and sad and as perfect a portrait of devastation that could possibly exist. \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nOso Oso, \u201cImpossible Game\u201d\n\nLong Beach, New York, boy Jade Lilitri\u2019s Oso Oso project has been one of the worst-kept secrets in emo and indie rock (two subgenres of rock music that, in 2019, are practically one and the same) since his 2017 release, The Yunahon Mixtape, made the rounds. That record\u2019s follow-up, Basking in the Glow, is due out next month, and \u201cImpossible Game\u201d might be its strongest single yet \u2014 all charging power-pop guitars and Lilitri\u2019s affecting vocals, wistful and soul-nourishing in the way that music that \u201csounds like this\u201d can be at its best. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nWhitney, \u201cValleys (My Love)\u201d\n\nThe press release for \u201cValleys (My Love)\u201d explains that the song is about \u201cthe anxiety of being away from a loved one,\u201d and it\u2019s pretty clear from the first line that the dudes in Whitney \u2014 the most comforting-sounding band we\u2019ve got \u2014 are feeling that anxiety pretty hard. The song opens with the line, \u201cThere\u2019s got to be another way,\u201d but instead of getting too hung up on what that other way might be, or the fact that there maybe is not another way for a bunch of touring musicians, Whitney does what Whitney does best, which is write songs that manage to evoke Van Morrison without sounding at all like Van Morrison, and I mean that as a huge compliment. Van Morrison, at his best, writes wistful songs that feel almost vaporous. You don\u2019t so much listen to his music as you do inhabit it. \u201cValleys (My Love)\u201d takes on a similar intangible but emotional quality. Even without knowing what this song is about, you\u2019ll hear the melancholy in every lilting horn or plucked string. It\u2019s the kind of track that you can play for anyone, anywhere, but it\u2019ll still make everyone stop what they\u2019re doing and get reflective. \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nWave Racer ft. Kwame, \u201cSummer Rain\u201d\n\nYour latest guilty pleasure has arrived, courtesy of Australian producer Wave Racer. \u201cSummer Rain\u201d features fellow Aussie rapper Kwame, who serves up mildly nonsensical, wholly delightful rhymes. \u201cI saw you dancing in the summer rain. You were looking weird, you were moving kinda strange. Don\u2019t know what it was but I had to know your name,\u201d Kwame raps over maximalist beats: the soundtrack to flings, festival season, and shorts that stick to you on the subway. \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nAnna Meredith, \u201cParamour\u201d\n\nBritish composer Anna Meredith\u2019s been around for a minute now, but you\u2019ve probably heard her music without even knowing it. Her intense, electro-acoustic compositions largely scored Eighth Grade, Bo Burnham\u2019s hilariously touching coming-of-tween-age comedy from last year. Meredith\u2019s spiky, hypnotic touch guarantees nothing but drama, and \u201cParamour\u201d \u2014 the first taste from her forthcoming sophomore album FIBS \u2014 is loaded with the good stuff, with melodic lines that tickle your spine and an overall rush that\u2019s impossible to pull yourself away from. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nFriday, July 12\n\nJenny Hval, \u201cAshes to Ashes\u201d\n\nNorwegian avant-pop wizard Jenny Hval\u2019s charted a prolific and fascinating career over the past decade, with releases swerving toward either side of accessibility while embracing high-minded conceptual arcs on femininity and personal politics. A friend recently remarked that sometimes it\u2019s more interesting to read about her music than it is to actually listen to it \u2014 an argument I don\u2019t quite agree with, but \u201cAshes to Ashes\u201d nonetheless can be appreciated by anybody with two ears and an open mind. The first taste from her forthcoming The Practice of Love is gently pulsing electronic music, crescendoing to a heavenly peak while Hval ruminates on the act of songwriting itself, comparing it to \u201cLike I used to dream of fucking / Before I knew how.\u201d \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\ufeff\n\nSampa the Great, \u201cOMG\u201d\n\nSampa the Great left a huge impression on me during a showcase at Australia\u2019s very own SXSW, a.k.a. Big Sound Festival, back in 2016. She was based there at the time as a student by way of Botswana. So when a missive from London-based label Ninja Tune came this week with news of her debut LP, I was highly intrigued. \u201cOMG\u201d is more than I\u2019d anticipated; a short, sharp teaser that plays out more like a theme tune than a lead single. It\u2019s filled with as much attitude as that full live showcase, providing a taste of her no-messing rap style and hunger to infuse the rhythmic celebratory sounds of her roots (via the help of producer Kwes) with the edge of modern hip-hop. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nBillie Eilish, \u201cBad Guy\u201d (Justin Bieber Remix)\n\nEven after Justin Bieber (cryptically) hinted at a collaboration earlier this week, he\u2019s the last person I thought I would hear on a remix of Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cBad Guy.\u201d But there it was on Instagram: a throwback photo of Eilish standing in front of a wall of Bieber posters announcing the collaboration. At first listen, Bieber doesn\u2019t quite belong on the track. \u201cGold teeth, my neck, my wrist is froze (So icy) / I got more ice than, than the snow / That guy, don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t know / That guy, so critical (Skrrt),\u201d he sings in his first verse. Part of the magic of \u201cBad Guy\u201d is its dark undertones sung by Eilish\u2019s airy voice. This is the girl who has suspended herself on a floating bed throughout her tour, cried a combination of \u201cxanthan gum mixed with charcoal water\u201d for a music video, and wiped blood on her face in her \u201cBad Guy\u201d music video. Behind the voice that gave us \u201cOcean Eyes\u201d and \u201cBitches Broken Hearts\u201d is a 17-year-old who\u2019s not afraid to get weird. Justin Bieber\u2019s feature doesn\u2019t quite give us that. A flawless voice? Sure. Matching Eilish\u2019s penchant for the eerie on a song where she repeatedly warns us she\u2019s the \u201cMake your girlfriend mad type / Might seduce your dad type?\u201d Well \u2026 no. Still, the song is a win for both teams. Bieber\u2019s last album was released in 2015. Meanwhile, Eilish once called Bieber her \u201cfirst love\u201d in an interview with Marie Claire (\u201cI\u2019ve been in love before, and it was with him\u201d). Beyond the actual song, this remix proves how far the teen has come \u2014 and in such a short time. Eilish said it best, \u201cOMGFFFFGGG ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE MAN.\u201d It\u2019s especially possible if you\u2019re Billie Eilish. \u2014Daise Bedolla\n\nJay Som, \u201cTenderness\u201d\n\nThe first single from indie wunderkind Jay Som\u2019s forthcoming Anak Ko, \u201cSuperbike,\u201d was a slab of beautiful and drifting shoegaze sounding both indebted to the rock subgenre\u2019s \u201990s peak and totally from the present day. But anyone who adored Melina Duterte\u2019s last album under the moniker, 2017\u2019s excellent Everybody Works, knows that her sound contains multitudes \u2014 so \u201cTenderness\u201d is another left turn for the shape-shifting artist. It\u2019s a smooth, disco-y tune made for the dance floor, with a chorus that gets at the literal heart of Duterte\u2019s expressive indie rock: \u201cTenderness is all I\u2019ve got.\u201d \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nBlood Orange ft. Toro y Moi, \u201cDark & Handsome\u201d\n\nOn Blood Orange\u2019s new mixtape, Angel\u2019s Pulse, Dev Hynes collaborates with chillwave artist Toro y Moi on single \u201cDark & Handsome,\u201d a self-aware, sorrowful anthem. In the chorus, Dev criticizes his own na\u00efvet\u00e9: \u201cNothing lasts forever, and I told you.\u201d He confesses he\u2019s \u201closin\u2019 touch of everything I know, prayin\u2019 for my heart to turn to stone,\u201d asking for his wrongs to be punished. And if you weren\u2019t already starting to tear up, he pays tribute to Mac Miller (\u201cCryin\u2019 for the ones I lost in \u201818\u201d), with whom he closely collaborated. Toro y Moi comes in on the second verse, rapping the track\u2019s title and self-deprecates, \u201cDon\u2019t be actin\u2019 dumb, cookie\u2019s gonna crumble \u2026 Happens all the time, plus I\u2019m dark and handsome.\u201d This song makes me feel like I came out of a very intense meditative therapy session with my psychiatrist. Do your therapy homework y\u2019all or you\u2019ll have to do it all in one hour! Forget Hot Girl Summer; this is Sad Girl Summer. \u2014Clare Palo\n\nChasity Belt, \u201cAnn\u2019s Jam\u201d\n\nThere really aren\u2019t enough odes to friendship out there \u2014 maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re being told to make more acquaintances instead of strengthening the bonds of our inner circles? Gabby\u2019s World once sang about how \u201cnothing in this world is holier than friendship,\u201d and where is the lie? Whatever the case may be, I appreciate the sentiment behind Chastity Belt\u2019s new single \u201cAnn\u2019s Jam.\u201d Nobody ever wants a band to go on hiatus, but the distress often comes from not understanding that breaks are perfectly healthy and should be normalized in our culture. We\u2019re not encouraged to have our own space and use the time we spend apart to figure out the best method to rebuild the foundation of our connections. This mellow, laid-back track is the lead single off Chastity Belt\u2019s long-awaited fourth studio album, which is co-produced by Melina Mae Duterte, a.k.a. Jay Som. Save the date for September 20! \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nPost Malone ft. Young Thug, \u201cGoodbyes\u201d\n\nThe fifth stage of living under Post Malone is acceptance, and it does seem like our dirtbag pop king has worn down many a skeptical listener over the last year (his perpetual chart presence, at the very least, more than confirms this). His latest single, \u201cGoodbyes,\u201d won\u2019t likely topple the still-dominant \u201cOld Town Road\u201d from the top of the Hot 100 \u2014 but it goes down so easy that you\u2019re likely to hear it for months to come regardless. Young Thug sounds like just another instrument in Post\u2019s sonic world, and even Mr. Malone himself might fade a little too well into the background on \u201cGoodbyes.\u201d But this is music practically made for pop ambience, and in that regard, the duo gets the job done. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nLillie Mae, \u201cTerlingua Girl\u201d\n\nUpon first listen, I heard the lyrics as \u201cterra lingual.\u201d As in, fluent in the land. Though Mae wrote the song as a teenager in her native town of Terlingua, Texas, the song functions as both a love letter to the south-Texan desert and a portrait of the girl who left it behind. Lillie Mae is part of a new generation of country singers. Honey-dripped vocals and earnest reflections remain center stage, but the image of the artist herself is grittier, the stories darker, and the characters relatable on a more visceral level. The milestones Mae sings of are murkier, more elusive, than first dates and Friday nights. \u201cTerlingua Girl\u201d follows \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Other Girls for That,\u201d Mae\u2019s spellbinding meditation on cheating released earlier this summer. Mae is a trained guitarist and pianist, but it\u2019s the fiddle she plays with abandon. \u201cWonder why you\u2019re so afraid, wonder what you\u2019re running from. You can\u2019t run out of this world, Terlingua girl. Face of a stranger, eyes so familiar,\u201d she sings, an ode to leaving home, returning, and everything in between. \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nFriday, June 28\n\nBad Bunny and J Balvin, \u201cCUIDADO POR AH\u00cd\u201d\n\nRumors had been swirling around for months about a joint album from Bad Bunny and J Balvin, and the reggaetoneros finally confirmed the chatter last night with a surprise announcement on Instagram: Oasis, an eight-song set, was dropping at midnight. The pair met through DJ Luian in 2016, and since then, both have built formidable careers. But it was apparent from their first collaboration in 2017, \u201cSi Tu Novio Te Deja Sola,\u201d that the duo paired well together, their voices blending in and out as they built on each other\u2019s verses. The same is evident on \u201cCUIDADO POR AH\u00cd\u201d (Careful Around There). The song\u2019s beat is eerie and heavy with anticipation. It\u2019s the song that hypes you up on the way to the party, and it\u2019ll no doubt be on plenty of summer playlists. Their voices are low, weaving around each other to the point where each individual artist is almost indiscernible. Welcome to the Oasis. \u2014Daise Bedolla\n\nThom Yorke, \u201cDawn Chorus\u201d\n\nIf Radiohead\u2019s Kid A taught us anything, it\u2019s that lots of emotion \u2014 anxiety, fear, defeat, desperation, and twisted, ecstatic joy \u2014 can be wrung from vagueness. That album succeeded because it captured everything Radiohead was great at, while emphasizing one of front man Thom Yorke\u2019s great strengths: He is good at nailing a specific vibe, even if no one is sure exactly what he\u2019s talking about. Kid A looms large over the band (they released many great records after it, but none pushed their sound so far into the future), but it looms largest on Yorke\u2019s solo career, which has involved a steady stripping back of the chaotic elements of Kid A, only to get to Anima, the closest Yorke\u2019ll probably get to making a traditional singer-songwriter album, but with an acoustic guitar switched out for the blue glow of a laptop or a lone synth rippling through a cobblestone street at dusk.\n\nThe album\u2019s best moment \u2014 there are many very good ones \u2014 comes in the form of \u201cDawn Chorus,\u201d a percussionless, nearly ambient meditation on death and regret and loss. Over a lone synth echo, Yorke half sings, half talks in a mixture of overworked phrases like \u201cCome on, chop chop\u201d and \u201cCome on, do your worst,\u201d while breaking into breathtaking moments of incisiveness. Hearing the depletion in his voice when he sings an antagonistic phrase like \u201cBig deal, so what? Please let me know when you\u2019ve had enough\u201d will shock you to silence. \u201cDawn Chorus\u201d is great because of what it is ostensibly about, but it\u2019s memorable for the way that it slows time down, the way its foreboding calmness overtakes everything. The song is its own singular world and one of the best things Yorke has made without the rest of Radiohead. I hope he never makes another song like it. \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nBrittany Howard, \u201cHistory Repeats\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t make too many hyperbolic statements about music on the internet, but I\u2019m confident in this one opinion: Brittany Howard is our greatest living vocalist. The Alabama Shakes front woman can sing with the thunder and soul of Aretha Franklin, but what impresses me most is how that same force translates even when she\u2019s taming the beast of her voice. On \u201cHistory Repeats,\u201d the lead single from her upcoming debut solo album Jaime (named after her late sister), her voice is malleable. The performance is not the main attraction. Instead, her voice is softened and distorted, melted into the free-form funk instrumentation. There aren\u2019t many lyrics either, just this one sentiment echoed several ways: You won\u2019t catch her reliving the same story over and over again (\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve already been / I came and went / I washed my hands with it / I don\u2019t wanna do it again\u201d). Brittany Howard won\u2019t do what\u2019s expected \u2014 even if it means putting the Shakes on hold to challenge herself on her own. She\u2019s restless. And I\u2019m ready for whatever Jaime has in store. \u2014Dee Lockett\n\nChastity, \u201cSun Poisoning\u201d\n\nHave you ever found a song that\u2019s a combination of all your favorite bands from high school? That\u2019s what happened to me when I listened to Chastity\u2019s new single, \u201cSun Poisoning.\u201d It filled me with so much joy that my toes were tingling for hours after listening to it and the memories of Warped Tour came flooding in. While I was looking for the right word to describe the perfect balance of bliss and melancholy, I was directed to the Portuguese term \u201csaudade\u201d which Portuguese writer Manuel de Melo once described as \u201ca pleasure you suffer, an ailment you enjoy,\u201d and I think that\u2019s the most accurate description for \u201cSun Poisoning.\u201d The emo-licious track is featured on the Ontario-based rock band\u2019s sophomore album, Home Made Satan, due out on September 13. (I\u2019ll save you the time and confirm that it the release date is on Friday the 13th.) \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nMUNA, \u201cWho\u201d\n\nWell thank goodness MUNA returned to announce their second album with a positive mental attitude slapper called \u201cNumber One Fan\u201d earlier this month because its follow-up is cataclysmically sad. \u201cWho\u201d is a whodunnit, kind of. It\u2019s an address to a former flame who had a heart of stone and \u201cnever let your feelings show\u201d and yet said emotionless ex is singing a love song to *somebody else*? The chorus comes and singer Katie Gavin asks the same question you\u2019re asking: \u201cWho?! Who?! Who are you singing about?!\u201d with a frog still in her chest. By the middle section she paints herself hearing this \u201csweet melody\u201d for the first time and realizing it wasn\u2019t intended for her. Gutted. But also - as is Gavin\u2019s way - there\u2019s a necessary lesson to be gleaned. And all of it is wrapped up in a sweet melody of MUNA\u2019s own, including cascading drums and dramatic chorus production that is to die for. To be entirely frank \u2018Who\u2019 is probably ten times the song it was written about. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nLucy Dacus, \u201cForever Half Mast\u201d\n\nPolitical songs are hard to pull off. Get too specific about what you\u2019re singing about, and you risk coming across as didactic or fussy; take the more general route, and you may as well be Lee goddamn Greenwood. It takes a deft, wise songwriting hand to hit that sweet spot\u2014and as it turns out, Lucy Dacus is just the songwriter for the job. The Richmond, VA indie rocker broke out with her Matador debut Historian last year, and she\u2019s since been releasing a series of holiday-specific singles that will be collected in a single release later this year. \u201cForever Half Mast\u201d has arrived right on time for the 4th of July, and it\u2019s the perfect anti-patriotic anthem at a point when more people than ever aren\u2019t exactly feeling that political spirit. \u201cThey were wrong when they said forget the past,\u201d she sings over easy guitar before suggesting we lower the stars-and-bars to the titular position \u2014 not quite love, not quite hate, just that miserable in-between feeling that isn\u2019t going to go away any time soon. And she makes it sound so good, too. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nAli Barter, \u201cBackseat\u201d\n\nChick rock is a hard genre to nail. Veer towards the experimental and you risk turning off mainstream listeners. Too soft? Sellout. Australian singer-songwriter Ali Barter hits it just right on \u201cBackseat,\u201d the first track released from her sophomore album Hello, I\u2019m Doing My Best. In the \u201cBackseat\u201d music video, Barter plays the awkward cool girl (a subset of the \u201cCool Girl\u201d trope) soliciting attention from a male guitar player. \u201cI know that you play in bands\u201d she screech-sings on repeat in high tones strapped to the beat of her electric guitar. Barter\u2019s take on affection, one that\u2019s clumsy, cute and a tad cringey, brings back memories of first crushes and school dances. And like any good suburban love story, it begins and ends with a license; in the video\u2019s last scene, Barter and her new beau sit side-by-side in her Triumph TR4 two-seater. \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nDrake feat. Rick Ross, \u201cMoney in the Grave\u201d\n\nDrake\u2019s new single has been stuck in my head this whole week. The Toronto native released \u201cMoney in the Grave\u201d after the Raptors won their first NBA Championship, and although it didn\u2019t hit me fully at first, I\u2019m glad the song is now out because I\u2019ve become completely obsessed with it. Against the backdrop of a steady, bass-heavy beat, Drake raps about how rich and on top of his game he is. It isn\u2019t his best from a lyrical perspective, but it\u2019s still catchy and sometimes that\u2019s all you need. Rick Ross\u2019s verse comes a bit later, and his voice is just as memorable as it\u2019s always been. It reminds me of a campfire, in that it\u2019s warm but gravelly, like the embers will light you on fire if you get too close. I love it. \u2014Alexia LaFata\n\nFlorist, \u201cTime Is a Dark Feeling\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve likely heard Emily Sprague\u2019s music without even knowing it. Earlier this year, a portion of her work as Florist \u2014 specifically, \u201cThank You,\u201d from the lovely 2016 album The Birds Outside Sang \u2014 was used in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s epochal concert film Homecoming. The music of Florist (Sprague also produces ambient music on her own) is intimate, tender, and reminiscent of the rawer material from Phil Elverum\u2019s the Microphones project \u2014 the type of soft-focus indie-pop that marvels at the particles that make up the world around us, even when melancholy is abundant. \u201cTime Is a Dark Feeling\u201d is taken from the upcoming Florist album Emily Alone, and it stays true to that album\u2019s title; the song is little more than Sprague\u2019s wispy vocals and gentle fingerpicking, tailor-made for those quiet moments in between the thrush of modern life. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nPurple Mountains, \u201cMargaritas at the Mall\u201d\n\nWithout question, the first time I felt like a real adult was when, in my early 20s, I was stuck at the airport and with nothing else to do, I killed time by drinking at the airport bar. Looking back, it\u2019s sort of messed up that my brain equated adulthood with carefully portioned whiskey in a bar at the airport, a place that no one ever really wants to be. The music of David Berman, whether he\u2019s recording as Silver Jews or here, with members of the band Woods as Purple Mountains, always evokes that same feeling in me: a weird mix of sadness and weight that is appealing because of the clarity it can provide. Sometimes personal epiphanies arrive in the form of well whiskey at the airport, or in this case, drinking margaritas at the mall. (Darker or less dark than drinking at the airport?) In David Berman\u2019s world, sometimes the best place to question the existence of God and the future of our planet is a chain bar at a mall. Something like this probably happens every day at the remaining malls in the U.S. That David Berman is able to make it sound noble (but still sad) is a great skill. \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nHobo Johnson, \u201cTypical Story\u201d\n\nThe master of \u201cmanic poetry\u201d is back. In the music video for his latest release \u201cTypical Story,\u201d we find Hobo Johnson raving poolside among bikini-clad goblins, bodybuilders, and other misfits. Though vivacious, \u201cTypical Story\u201d is a meditation on struggle: from the dad who loses everything to the \u201cdog who wanted to run away \u2019til he learned that his life is way safer inside a cage.\u201d And for 24-year-old Johnson, who endured a difficult upbringing that resulted in stints of homelessness and jail time during his formative years, struggle is perhaps more familiar than his budding (Internet) stardom. Compared with his initial hit \u201cPeach Scone,\u201d Johnson manages to ramble less on \u201cTypical Story\u201d without sacrificing his trademark erraticism. The California artist doesn\u2019t shy from the wacky, but his lyrics often hold more weight than his videos suggest. This may be \u201cthe story of the kid who clearly won\u2019t know what to say,\u201d but Johnson lets us into his anxieties. When he raps the line, \u201cI\u2019m afraid of everything staying the same or worsening / So what\u2019s the point of finding calm when calm to me is unsettling,\u201d he moves in slow motion, eyes wide open, before the rambunctious scene engulfs him once more. \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nFriday, June 21\n\nLil Nas X, \u201cPanini\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s just get straight to it: Lil Nas X\u2019s new EP is a hot ass mess and he may never make a better song than the one he\u2019s known for. Sometimes we peak early. Shit happens. That said, where Lil Nas X may already be running out of road, the young NYC production duo Take a Daytrip are just starting to find their lane. They struck accidental gold last summer with Sheck Wes\u2019s viral \u201cMo Bamba\u201d and have now scored double placement on the Lil Nas X EP, producing its two best non-\u201cOTR\u201d songs, \u201cPanini\u201d and \u201cRodeo.\u201d (And that\u2019s with contributions from veterans Boi-1da, Ryan Tedder, and Travis Barker elsewhere on the project.) Most of the songs on the EP sound like they were microwaved a few seconds before release time. \u201cPanini\u201d has been cooking for awhile, though, first debuted back in April. (I\u2019ve even heard it played live twice since then.) Lil Nas X doesn\u2019t want to be just a rapper, so Daytrip gave him some wiggle room with a rap song and a rap-ish/country-ish song. He gets outshone on the latter, \u201cRodeo,\u201d by Cardi B because he\u2019s not as adaptable as he thinks. But in \u201cPanini,\u201d over booming 808s and some Western-parody whistling, singing about how expectations are just plain weird, he sounds in his bag. \u2014Dee Lockett\n\nThe Hold Steady, \u201cDenver Haircut\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since the Hold Steady have released a new album, but in that time frontman Craig Finn released a bunch of solo albums, and the band dropped a few singles here and there. Plenty of bands go on hiatus, but with the Hold Steady it made a bit more sense. Each song is a short story: a collection of misguided nostalgia transmuted into tiny details that evoke a feeling of sentimentality. It\u2019s a hard trick to pull off, but Finn is such a great writer that it always seems to work out fine.\n\nSo even though the band\u2019s been gone for a bit, you wouldn\u2019t know it, because \u201cDenver Haircut\u201d is prime Hold Steady \u2014 characters have drug-induced hallucinations, yearn to escape the place they live, listen to Metallica, get robbed, and go through personal transformations at the airport. All this happens in just a few minutes, and its a lot to absorb, but one lyric stands out above the rest: \u201cFound a man with a handful huddled over some car keys / it doesn\u2019t have to be pure, it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect / just sort of has to be worth it.\u201d Sure, Finn is singing about drugs, but there\u2019s no line more heartbreakingly real and applicable across a wide spectrum of experiences than \u201cjust sort of has to be worth it.\u201d \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nChloe x Halle, \u201cthinkin\u2019 about me\u201d\n\nHot Girl Summer is a meme, sure, but it is first and foremost a way of life. It is bad bitches living their baddest bitch truth. Now, of course, Chloe x Halle are a bit more wholesome in their portrayal of this attitude, because they\u2019re 19 and 20, but if you\u2019ve seen them on Grown-ish, you know they, too, are about this life. (Like they said on their debut album, \u201cIf I\u2019m in the mood, I\u2019ll get as ratchet as I wanna.\u201d) The duo have released two new songs for the show. One is a very pretty ballad about catching feelings; the other, \u201cthinkin\u2019 about me,\u201d is full-on flex about catching dudes\u2019 attention. It\u2019s about playing games. It\u2019s about toying with some boy\u2019s emotions and messing with his head for shits and giggles and a confidence boost. (\u201cWhen you text me, I\u2019m curving, my girls say, \u2018Hold up, don\u2019t hurt \u2018em\u201d LOL.) It\u2019s some true fuckgirl behavior, honestly, but you won\u2019t catch me judging! \u2014Dee Lockett\n\nMark Ronson ft. Angel Olsen, \u201cTrue Blue\u201d\n\nMark Ronson locked in some power collaborations for Late Night Feelings, but \u201cTrue Blue\u201d is the winner of the bunch because it is so unexpected. There\u2019s no better person to recruit for a timeless breakup record than Angel Olsen, and I did not know that I wanted her to go pop until today. Now that we\u2019re here, I need more! As the modern classic opens with \u201cFucking around, I\u2019m falling in love / Saying good-bye \u2018cause you\u2019re giving it up / All that you were, all that you lost/ Who ever thought it came with a cost,\u201d I can visualize disco balls getting into rotation. Anyone else planning on texting their next target \u201clove the way you read my eyes\u201d or is that just me? \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nYellow Days, \u201cJust When\u201d\n\nAtlanta fans may recognize Yellow Days \u2014 a.k.a. 19-year-old British artist artist George van den Broek \u2014 from the show\u2019s season two trailer, which features the song \u201cGap in the Clouds.\u201d On his latest release \u201cJust When,\u201d van den Broek delivers yet another track that\u2019s as moody as it is mellow. His knack? Writing songs about feeling exhausted that sound decidedly unbothered. \u201cAnd just when I think everything\u2019s okay / A cloud comes along and it pours with rain / And I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m wasting away / And I know that you love me baby and it must hurt to hear me say that, yeah\u201d van den Broek croons over a reggae-inspired beat. \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nE-40 f. Quavo, Roddy Rich, ASAP Ferg, and Schoolboy Q, \u201cChase the Money\u201d\n\nE-40 did it to himself. He\u2019s been so insanely prolific in recent years that it\u2019s hard to find the time to absorb his music before he\u2019s moved on to the next thing. Still, line for line, he\u2019s one of the most fun rappers to listen to \u2014 his voice is full of peaks and valleys, and he can fit pretty much any phrase into any beat. There\u2019s a reason that he got other weird voiced guys on this track \u2014 both ASAP Ferg and Schoolboy Q owe a considerable debt to 40 \u2014 who made having a weird perspective on pretty much everything under the sun a marketable skill. \u201cChase the Money\u201d which is the name of the song, and the name of the guy who produced the song (you may recognize his infectious \u201cchase the money\u201d drop from approximately 65 million other songs), is kind of a sleeper: At first it seems like a run of the mill single from a bunch of big names, but then all of a sudden you\u2019re playing it again and singing along with Roddy Rich\u2019s chorus about driving down Fairfax. \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nFloating Points, \u201cLesAlpx\u201d\n\nWhen Sam Shepherd broke out as Floating Points at the turn of the decade, his sound was pure, expansive techno \u2014 the type that caught the ear of influential left-field listeners like Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke, tuneful and winding like a staircase built out of synthesizers. On 2015\u2019s lovely breakout Elaenia, he took his compositional know-how to new levels, crafting jazzy and psychedelic electronic music that was less made for the dancefloor and more for contemplative headspaces \u2014 but on his new single \u201cLesAlpx,\u201d he\u2019s back with the thump, and how. It\u2019s the most bodymoving single he\u2019s put out since 2010\u2019s \u201cPeople\u2019s Potential,\u201d with an insistent beat and trickles of melody mingling with Vangelis-esque synths. The tune runs just under five minutes, but in the right groove you could imagine listening to it for hours on repeat. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nMichael Kiwanuka & Tom Misch, \u201cMoney\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fitting that the return of Big Little Lies syncs with a Michael Kiwanuka release. That he collaborated with fellow Brit Tom Misch to serve up some sinister funk is almost too much. On \u201cMoney,\u201d Kiwanuka experiments with falsetto notes while YEBBA contributes backup vocals. In an email exchange with FADER, Misch called out their \u201ccommon love for 808s and disco.\u201d Though it rings bright and dancey, the song\u2019s lyrics issue a warning. \u201cThe premise of \u2018Money\u2019 is that, at first listen, it\u2019s a song about money and how much I want it and love it,\u201d according to Kiwanuka. \u201cI want to use money to meet people and be around people that have a lot of it. But as you listen closer, it\u2019s actually about how too much love for money can be dangerous.\u201d \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nMetronomy, \u201cSalted Caramel Ice Cream\u201d\n\nMetronomy is the five-piece lovechild of producer, songwriter, and performer Joseph Mount, and for those in the know, they\u2019re the chicest band around, capable of navigating away from their nu-rave roots towards classic disco and groove-laden indie. Coming in melting after Mount\u2019s recent collaborative efforts with Robyn on her LP Honey, \u201cSalted Caramel Ice Cream\u201d might be the apex of all Metronomy\u2019s experiments so far. It marries Mount\u2019s clever nods to the past (hello, Lipps Inc.\u2019s \u201cFunkytown\u201d) with his English-indebted quirks, likening an object of affection to salted caramel ice cream. \u201cOh God she\u2019s coming, don\u2019t look up!\u201d go the lyrics, fizzing with the heart murmurs of an early stage crush. I\u2019ll have another scoop please. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nCaroline Polachek, \u201cDoor\u201d\n\nDearly departed synth-pop heroes Chairlift were always underrated for how weird they could sound \u2014 an expert mingling of the strange and the accessible, as Caroline Polachek and Patrick Wimberly tinkered in the studio like mad synth-pop scientists. On her own, Polachek has previously gone headlong into wilder territory as Ramona Lisa, but her new solo single under her own name is a perfect merge of Chairlift\u2019s skyscraping approach and her more inscrutable tendencies. \u201cDoor\u201d skips and slithers like a trail of smoke before opening up into an expansive chorus, with tons of production gew-gaws buried in the mix. It\u2019s fascinating and endlessly repeatable, and it has us wondering what else Polachek has up her sleeve, too. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nJune 14, 2016\n\nKali Uchis, Mac Miller, and Free Nationals, \u201cTime\u201d\n\nAnderson .Paak\u2019s the Free Nationals and Kali Uchis have released a track with the late Mac Miller, leading as a single for the group\u2019s upcoming self-titled album. \u201cTime\u201d is the first song featuring Mac\u2019s vocals since his death in September 2018. Over Kali\u2019s hazy chorus and the group\u2019s jazzy beat, Mac raps about his relationship struggles, asking his partner not to leave him: \u201cWe just need some time.\u201d He starts out pessimistic while referencing a line from his 2018 album Swimming, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t trip, but I slip, I fall,\u201d but promises it\u2019ll all work, \u201cin the end, everything will be fine, that\u2019s by design.\u201d Although this is the first music released after Mac\u2019s death, we can probably expect the late rapper to lend his voice to more tracks in the future. \u2014Clare Palo\n\nBenny the Butcher ft. Pusha T, \u201c18 Wheeler\u201d\n\nPusha T\u2019s post-Clipse rap career has been a fascinating one. By all conventional metrics of popular rap music, he should not be as popular as he is because Pusha is a rapper\u2019s rapper. He raps everything at pretty much the exact same speed, and like some kind of menacing but not especially emotional Godzilla, he destroys everything in his path. In the wrong hands, his rap style \u2014 dead-eyed drug talk and steel-mouthed threats combined with a penchant for not flaunting what he\u2019s got \u2014 would be a snooze. In Pusha\u2019s hands, it\u2019s the sort of flow that could ruin Drake\u2019s summer. Now, a little over a year after the release of Daytona, Pusha\u2019s linked up with Benny the Butcher, the gravelly voiced Buffalo rapper who sounds like the kind of dude who would be named Benny the Butcher. In other words, he\u2019s a mercenary, which means that he and Pusha play well off each other. \u201c18 Wheeler\u201d should be listened to while standing in the general vicinity of a cemetery on a cold February day. Okay, fine, it\u2019s almost summer but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t throw on a bubblegoose and go lurk around some crumbling headstones with this in your headphones right now. \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nFinneas, \u201cAngel\u201d\n\nFinneas\u2019s \u201cAngel\u201d is not your typical song of the summer. The moody ballad, written while on tour with his sister Billie Eilish in November, is not what you turn to on a blazing summer day on your way to the beach, but it is the song you play when you\u2019re in the back of a car, sleepy, slightly sunburned, on your way home. In other words: You\u2019re probably going to feel a little sad after listening to it, even if the song is about \u201cfalling in love with someone and feeling so in awe of them that you wonder if they\u2019re even real.\u201d \u201cI bought a house to live in / But you\u2019re the home I\u2019m missin\u2019,\u201d he croons. \u201cNothing good lasts forever / But nights with you are better.\u201d As the follow-up to his April release \u201cI Lost a Friend,\u201d O\u2019Connell continues to solidify his space not just as a producer and a writer, but as a singer in his own right with an intensely personal sound. He may have just landed himself, at No. 1 no less, on Billboard\u2019s inaugural Hot 100 Songwriters and Hot 100 Producers charts, but I\u2019m personally waiting for the moment he lands himself at the top of the Billboard 200 albums chart. \u2014Daise Bedolla\n\nGoldLink (ft. Tyler, the Creator and Jay Prince), \u201cU Say\u201d\n\nD.C.\u2019s favorite rapper GoldLink is back with his latest release, Diaspora. Packed with plenty of features \u2014 from Pusha T, Tyler, the Creator, Khalid, Bibi Bourelly, and more \u2014 the debut album (the others were technically mixtapes) is a certified bop. It\u2019s hard to pick one great track on this album, as every song blends together seamlessly into a perfect dancehall playlist, but \u201cU Say\u201d is a standout single. Featuring Tyler, the Creator and Jay Prince, this song will be booming loudly on every block this summer. It\u2019s as much of a song about that steamy summer romance as it is about falling in love with your dance partner in the club. GoldLink, thank you for the perfect summer vibe. \u2014Clare Palo\n\nThe Appleseed Cast, \u201cChaotic Waves\u201d\n\nThe more-multifarious-than-you-think sound of emo has, arguably, become the predominant style in indie rock over the past five years \u2014 in other words, the perfect time for the Appleseed Cast to return. The long-running Lawrence, Kansas, outfit have been at it for two decades now, mixing prog\u2019s knottiness and post-rock\u2019s epic sweep with traditional first-wave emo signifiers to glorious effect. \u201cChaotic Waves\u201d is the first single from Fleeting Light of Impermanence, their first album in six years; from the sound of it, they haven\u2019t missed a beat, with a gorgeous and cascading guitar line punctuated by Christopher Crisci\u2019s expressive vocals. It\u2019s a great entry point into the Appleseed Cast\u2019s dense catalogue; if you weren\u2019t familiar before, now\u2019s your chance to catch up. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nVagabon, \u201cFlood Hands\u201d\n\nVagabon is one of the most progressive artists that you probably don\u2019t know about, but the power anthem \u201cFlood Hands\u201d is about to change that, along with the rest of the material from her sophomore album. \u201cI know even if run from it I\u2019m still in it / I know I\u2019ll hold you so close,\u201d she chants. \u201cI know even if I run from it I\u2019m still in it / I know in my heart.\u201d It\u2019s the most pop-forward song we\u2019ve ever heard from Vagabon, yet it doesn\u2019t sound out of her element at all. L\u00e6titia Tamko is shifting the music landscape as we know it, remember her name and follow her lead now. \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nYour Smith, \u201cWild Wild Woman\u201d\n\nL.A.-based pop star Caroline Smith (now known as Your Smith) has another Caroline Smith within her. And she comes at night just as the singer is about to give up and fall asleep. This other person is loud and unpredictable. You can\u2019t take her anywhere and yet still \u2026 There\u2019s something about her, something that can\u2019t be tamed, and it sets her free. Don\u2019t we all have a \u201cwild, wild woman\u201d inside of us? If not, why not? We damn well should. Smith\u2019s latest single is a delectable, synth-pop injection of pure funk that eventually descends into a minimal, sexy breakdown. If the song was indeed a person, you\u2019d be crazy to refuse a night on the tiles with her. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nBanks ft. Francis and the Lights, \u201cLook What You\u2019re Doing to Me\u201d\n\nI always forget that I\u2019m a fan of Francis and the Lights until he puts something new out. This new single with Banks might be my favorite collaboration she\u2019s ever done? You have my attention again, Jillian. I\u2019m actually addicted to it, please send help! \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nFreddie Gibbs and Madlib ft. Anderson .Paak, \u201cGiannis\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent any time listening to new music on YouTube, you\u2019ve probably come across the visual tool that everyone loves to use right now: a still image with just the slightest movement to keep your attention. In the case of \u201cGiannis,\u201d the latest single from the fruitful collaboration between the psychedelic, perma-stoned producer Madlib and Freddie Gibbs, one of the finest technical stylists we\u2019ve got right now, the visualizer feels especially effective. Sometimes these things are a total snooze: It\u2019ll be, like, some salt-and-pepper static inside a letter or some other tiny movement that gestures at the fact that we\u2019re not looking at a still image. Here, we get a Jeff Jank animated loop of Madlib\u2019s alter ego Quasimoto smoking a joint, holding a brick, and staring at a record spinning. It\u2019s hypnotic, which is supposed to be the point, but it perfectly illustrates the circular way that Gibbs and Madlib work together. Madlib works with loops, but there\u2019s often other extraneous noise in his samples, usually due to a rough beat chop or ambient record crackle \u2014 it creates the illusion of change where there maybe isn\u2019t much. Here, there\u2019s some of that, but mainly there\u2019s Gibbs, switching up his flow, not so much barreling through the beat as riding it, pitching his voice against the rise and fall of the sample. Like many other Freddie Gibbs songs, with and without Madlib, he\u2019s presenting a nonstop barrage of imagery: something about Dora the Explorer, something else about Ace Hood (sidenote: Ace Hood is much more prolific than people realize. Between 2008 and 2019, he released 25 full-length projects), and then he\u2019s out just in time for Anderson .Paak to ooze out a melodic rap that calms things down and closes out the song. \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nJacob Collier, \u201cMoon River\u201d\n\nIn a cramped recording studio in Soho, a shoeless Jacob Collier hits play. A handful of critics, friends, and collaborators form a crescent around the 24-year-old Brit. Some recline on velvet couches while others sit cross-legged on the floor. Barely audible bird chirpings float on airy vocals that grow into bellows, easing the listener into Collier\u2019s world. Nine minutes and 5,000 vocal parts later, the curtain drops. While Collier isn\u2019t the first to try his hand at the Andy Williams 1960 original (Frank and Frank produced notable versions), Collier\u2019s adds something new to the mix. It turns a staid lullaby into a living chorus that sticks with you long after its final note. It builds into a cacophony of voices (144 in total) singing overlapping, elongated parts. Collier reached out to featured collaborators with a simple ask: record yourself singing moon in B-flat and send the video clip his way. That he managed to get Chris Martin and Ty Dolla $ign on the same track is reason enough to press play. \u2014Corinne Osnos\n\nFriday, June 7\n\nBTS and Charli XCX, \u201cDream Glow\u201d\n\nToday in things I didn\u2019t know my soul required: BTS and Charli XCX, leaders of the pop free world, have collaborated. And while it could\u2019ve been totally phoned-in \u2013 as gimmicky as the band\u2019s new mobile game, which the song was made to promote, probably is (sorry, don\u2019t come for me!) \u2013 but BTS and Charli do nothing without intention. They are, respectively, impossibly prolific and yet rarely sacrifice quality in saturating the global market. Their first-ever collaboration is produced by Stargate, the legendary Norwegian duo responsible for some of the best Britney, Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, and Katy hits; BTS and Charli were not fucking around. It\u2019s arguably the most straight-forward constructed pop song BTS have ever made (note that it features only vocals from Jungkook, Jin, and Jimin \u2013 no rapping \u2013 though it\u2019s credited to all of BTS), a product of the Charli-Stargate Midas touch. (Those larger-than-life synth swells are the DNA of Scandinavian pop production, and are also the foundation of this song.) BTS have zero need to bend to trends to make themselves more accessible to the English-speaking world (which is why those Halsey and Nicki Minaj collabs always felt kinda forced), so it\u2019s incredible to watch them make that tired industry school of thought work for them, and not the other way around. This is BTS\u2019 best Western collaboration to date. \u2014Dee Lockett\n\nRandall Park, \u201cI Punched Keanu Reeves\u201d\n\nLast Friday night, while I ate take-out Thai food that tasted absolutely nothing like Sasha Tran\u2019s (Ali Wong) Korean cooking in Always Be My Maybe, I found the Song of the Summer. That\u2019s right, Randall Park has dropped the hottest song this week. In the film, that Vulture essentially willed into being, Park plays Marcus Kim, the lead singer of Hello Peril, a good? San Francisco local band that has exactly one hit. The track, which was freshly released on the film\u2019s soundtrack, features three (!) Hello Peril songs, the hit Mariah Carey song that inspired the film\u2019s title, a sexy D\u2019Angelo track that makes a rightful cameo in the movie, and more. But clearly the highlight is Hello Peril\u2019s \u201cI Punched Keanu Reeves,\u201d which originates from a riveting scene where Park punches real life Keanu Reeves in the face, at Reeves\u2019s request. The punch was \u201cbetter than any scene you could see in Speed,\u201d which I can confirm is in fact true. Something about seeing Reeve\u2019s asking to be hit is extremely delightful. \u2014Clare Palo\n\nJai Paul, \u201cHe\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s harder than ever to be surprised by anything these days, but British musical polymath Jai Paul\u2019s sudden return last weekend was one of the most truly shocking (in a good way) musical moments of the year so far. His legendary, leaked collection of demos are now available on streaming, so if you haven\u2019t heard those\u2014well, what are you waiting for? Paul also dropped a new two-tracker, \u201cDo You Love Her Now\u201d b/w \u201cHe\u201d; both are great, but it\u2019s the b-side that\u2019s sounding especially good at the moment. There\u2019s some DNA from Paul\u2019s classic 2012 single \u201cJasmine\u201d in here, but the mood is even duskier and more intense, with a soft bassline pulse reminiscent of the \u201cLove on a Real Train\u201d scene in Risky Business. Let\u2019s hope Paul\u2019s back for good\u2014by the sound of these new songs, we need him in our lives. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\n(Sandy) Alex G, \u201cGretel\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t thought about any of the Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales in over a decade, but leave it to (Sandy) Alex G to find a way to rework Hansel and Gretel into an eerily charming narrative of his own. \u201cGretel\u201d serves as a cautionary tale about the toxic nature of greed and overindulgence. Alex eases us in with a familiar feeling of comfort by using an acoustic guitar, metallic piano, and faint pitter-pattering drums before coming in hot with synthesizers and manipulating his vocals by shifting the pitch. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna go back/ Nobody\u2019s gonna push me off track/ I see what they do/ Good people got something to lose,\u201d he sings without breaking his stride. This song tastes like a scoop of your favorite flavor of water ice from whatever local shop that has your loyalty, a luxury that only South Jersey and Philly natives know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019ll admit that I didn\u2019t love Rocket as much as the rest of the industry, but I\u2019m salivating at the prospect of House of Sugar. \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nJay Som, \u201cSuperbike\u201d\n\nIndie rocker Jay Som unleashed a quiet riot with her breakout 2017 LP Everybody Works, and this first single from her forthcoming third album Anak Ko suggests that her hot streak of emotive, youthful-sounding indie rock is tough to break. Fans of shoegaze\u2019s swirling guitars and gently warped vocals wont be disappointed here, and the first two-thirds of \u201cSuperbike\u201d sound perfectly ripped from some dreamy past life; then, a searing guitar line rips through the closing minutes\u2019 cloudiness, sticking the landing perfectly in a way that has us excited to hear what the rest of the album sounds like. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nMUNA, \u201cNumber One Fan\u201d\n\nCould it be there exists a very funny pop song that also belongs on the dance floor while at the same time contains a realistic message of self-worth that\u2019s as attainable as it is catchy? \u201cNumber One Fan\u201d is the song you didn\u2019t know you needed so badly until it arrived right in front of your face. It\u2019s just the right side of poptastic insanity, loaded with bouncing synth lines and bass tones that are as likely to recall hours spent idly playing \u201890s games consoles as they do hits of the era such as Len\u2019s \u201cSteal My Sunshine\u201d or The New Radicals. Lyrically, it\u2019s a conversation between the voices in your head, and it chooses to bat away your inner dickheads in favor of your own cheerleader. \u201cOh my god,\u201d it says, with a sudden surprise. \u201cI\u2019m your number one fan?!\u201d I guess you can choose: do you want to be a band capable of holding a mirror up to society, or do you want to be a band capable of holding a mirror up to yourselves? MUNA do both. With their second album confirmed for later this summer, 2019 is about to be theirs. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nBon Iver, \u201cHey, Ma\u201d\n\nWhat is Bon Iver up to? Justin Vernon premiered new material at a concert last weekend, and before you knew it he was unveiling a new website with some of those new songs for your home-listening pleasure. One of those new cuts, \u201cU (Man Like),\u201d is a collab-loaded cut featuring Bon Iver Cinematic Universe members like Bruce Hornsby and Moses Sumney \u2014 but it\u2019s \u201cHey, Ma\u201d that stands out most out of the two new cuts we\u2019ve heard from the project so far. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not a Cam\u2019ron cover, but \u201cHey, Ma\u201d should resonate well with anyone who felt entranced by Bon Iver\u2019s last album, 22, A Million in 2016, with similar electro-pop pinnings and Vernon\u2019s impossibly holistic vocals taking center stage yet again. If you\u2019ll remember, 22, A Million was effectively Bon Iver\u2019s return after a six-year hiatus; seems like we might get the follow-up much sooner than that span of time, which is a good thing. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nWhitney, \u201cGiving Up\u201d\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been waiting an eternity for the arrival of Whitney\u2019s sophomore album, but all that patience paid off now that \u201cGiving Up\u201d is here. 2016\u2019s Light Upon The Lake saw the Chicago band ushering in a wave of \u201ccountry soul\u201d and now that the yee-haw agenda is in full swing, the timing of their return couldn\u2019t be better planned. Three years later and the boys are back to kickoff the start of summer with a batch of fresh tunes that make you feel alive. While I never want them to depart for that long again, I fully respect their process. \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nRoisin Murphy, \u201cIncapable\u201d\n\nFor at least fifteen years, the eclectic and multifarious electronic pop that Roisin Murphy sounds has been one of the worst-kept secrets in indie circles. Her solo albums are as fascinating and rich as her work with egghead house producer Matthew Herbert, and she notched a star turn on the glitchy \u201cIllumination,\u201d off of one of last year\u2019s best albums, dance god DJ Koze\u2019s earthy and blissful Knock Knock. Her latest solo single is eight and a half minutes of sneaky, brilliant house music\u2014the type of tricky bliss that Vladislav Delay once achieved on his classic Luomo record Vocalcity, only these grooves come from frequent Murphy collaborator Crooked Man. Listen to this in the dark \u2014 or anywhere else, really. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nFriday, June 7\n\nKaty Perry, \u201cNever Really Over\u201d\n\nJustice for Witness! I make that proclamation with all seriousness \u2014 even though Perry\u2019s last album was seemingly bereft of the type of smash hits she\u2019s built her career on, it\u2019s likely to age well as a gently experimental, electro-focused pop album that diverged from her time-tested brand of inspo-pop. Still, she obviously had to change it up a little for her new era, and her latest single \u201cNever Really Over\u201d comes off as a capable and surprisingly effective split between her previously established talent for soaring anthems and the gooey dance sound that was smeared across Witness, with a synth-led chorus that Robyn would more than appreciate. Check the video, too, which gives off a serious and (hopefully) self-aware cultish vibe suitable for anyone that\u2019s steeling themselves for Midsommar. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nSufjan Stevens, \u201cLove Yourself\u201d and \u201cWith My Whole Heart\u201d\n\nIs there anything that needs to be said other than my heart is full? Sufjan Stevens continues to be the gift that keeps on giving, and \u201cLove Yourself\u201d and \u201cWith My Whole Heart\u201d are exactly what the world needs post\u2013Call Me by Your Name. This is quite possibly the best way to kick off Pride. While we (the world) probably don\u2019t deserve this, we should be eternally grateful anyway. \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nMiley Cyrus, \u201cD.R.E.A.M.\u201d\n\nMiley\u2019s not dreaming on her new EP, but she is doing a collab with Ghostface Killah. On She Is Coming, Miley sings about her loving relationship with drugz in \u201cD.R.E.A.M.\u201d In a trancelike opening, she sings about outer space and UFOs, and fucking on an airplane \u2014 just normal 20-something stuff. The track is a homage to Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s \u201cC.R.E.A.M,\u201d and, with trademark Miley subtlety, spells it out in the chorus: \u201cDrugs rule everything around me.\u201d Then comes Ghostface rapping at the tail end of the song, adding a little more credibility to her fluctuating hip-hop career. Sound like a lot? Well the chorus is contagious, so watch out. \u2014Clare Palo\n\nSleater-Kinney, \u201cHurry On Home\u201d\n\nIt was too much when Sleater-Kinney posted a photo of the three of them with St. Vincent at the start of the year, but it was also welcome. They hadn\u2019t released a record for four years. St. Vincent had since continued to become one of the most versatile and vital gifts in alternative rock. For Annie Clark to be the announced producer on the pioneering riot grrrls\u2019 new material was immediately beyond logical \u2014 so clear you wonder why you didn\u2019t think of it. It also created a palpable thrill for what such a collaboration might sound like. Well, it sounds like an angular guitar battlefield in which nobody crosses the desires of the women instigating this party. \u201cYou know I\u2019m unfuckuable, unloveable, unlistenable, unwatchable, just hurry on home to me \u2026\u201d sings Carrie Brownstein, throwing acid on her own self before also chastising her lover for validating her own nagging self-doubts. What an invitation. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nThe Voidz, \u201cThe Eternal Tao\u201d\n\nReady for a hot take? Here goes: At this point, I\u2019d take a thousand more albums from Strokes front man Julian Casablancas\u2019s freakazoid-rock project the Voidz instead of a single new Strokes song. Call me crazy, but over the past five years the Voidz have gone from brown-sound annoyance to one of the most interesting rock bands going right now. \u201cThe Eternal Tao\u201d is their latest single, presumably from the forthcoming follow-up to their fascinating sophomore effort Virtue; it was co-produced by indie provocateurs Mac DeMarco and Kirin J. Callinan, it sounds a little like house music, and features liberal amounts of Auto-Tune. Yup, sounds about right. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nSwim Deep, \u201cTo Feel Good\u201d\n\nSwim Deep are a once NME-championed band from the early 2010s London indie scene; they came from Birmingham with enormous ambition and even bigger hearts, were signed to a major label, and became the alternative equivalent of a boy band. The music was always good, but somehow as the music got better, the band found themselves in more perilous situations. Some lineup shifts and life struggles later, front man Austin Williams, bassist Cavan McCarthy, and keys man James Balmont now return with new players. \u201cTo Feel Good\u201d employs the gospel chorus from \u201cEverybody\u2019s Free (To Feel Good)\u201d as a backdrop for Williams\u2019s spoken word tale of ordinary life, where reality bites and glimmers of hope remain in the most uninspired of places. When Williams speaks of the man in the job center who would humor Williams\u2019s own dreams to pursue music in exchange for more time on the dole, there\u2019s nothing sweeter than the gratitude he extends to a kind stranger\u2019s words: \u201cDon\u2019t forget me when you\u2019re famous.\u201d \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nBurial, \u201cClaustro\u201d\n\nBurial back! New music from William Bevan \u2014 one of the most influential dance producers of the last 20 years, full stop \u2014 is always cause for celebration, and the heads surely salivated this week at the announcement of a new two-tracker out next month from his longtime label home Hyperdub. \u201cClaustro\u201d is one half of that release, and it\u2019s both very Burial-y and a bit of a changeup: His dusty, decayed approach to U.K. garage is still present and accounted for, but there\u2019s a sense of tonal playfulness that\u2019s not always found in his work \u2014 more proof that his genius remains uncompromisingly surprising as ever. \u2014Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nKing Princess, \u201cCheap Queen\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if King Princess would be able to top \u201cPussy Is God,\u201d but her latest single is a bop that won\u2019t stop. \u201cCheap Queen\u201d straight-up put me in my place as Mikaela Straus dragged me for every time that I\u2019ve ever pretended to be low maintenance. The day that you recognize that you\u2019re a queen is honestly life-altering, I hope more women get to experience that through this meditative song. Cue the King Princess drop-your-debut-album challenge. \u2014Sydney Gore\n\nMay 24, 2019\n\n5 Seconds of Summer, \u201cEasier\u201d\n\nI do not hold half as much affection in my heart for Charlie Puth as, ahem, my colleague Hunter Harris does (no one should! It\u2019s unhealthy!), but I have conceded at least one point to her: The boy can fuck around and make a hit in his sleep. Which is why, if you play 1D successors 5 Seconds of Summer\u2019s new single, \u201cEasier,\u201d and find yourself irrationally obsessed, I encourage you to take a gander at the credits. The Puth co-wrote and co-produced the thing! To be fair, giving a \u201cco\u201d credit to anyone else involved is generous; this baby\u2019s got the Puth\u2019s DNA all over it, from the aggressively mid-tempo synth structure to the moody lovelorn lyrics to the exclusively falsetto vocal performance (respect to Luke for pulling that off). This is the reset 5SOS deserve and if it\u2019s all credit to the Puth then, damn it, Hunter, you win! \u2014Dee Lockett\n\nSteve Lacy, \u201cPlayground\u201d\n\nThe Compton-based producer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist known for his work as a member of the Internet has unleashed his debut album Apollo XXI today, and the hype has not been unwarranted. The full LP is a psychedelic R&B ride: Very wow, very melodic, and so cool I wonder if I qualify enough to listen to it. Certain moments vibe much harder than others. One such track is solid standout \u201cPlayground.\u201d Lacy told Zane Lowe he was channeling Prince and the Dirty Projectors in this one. On paper that sounds untenable, but in actuality it\u2019s spot-on. It\u2019s a wonder Prince didn\u2019t write a song that breezily compares sex to being in a playground? This hard-to-resist jam is built around the Paisley Park hero\u2019s guitar-funk style and features Lacy in high-strung falsetto mode \u2014 a bold move, and one he shows no signs of struggling to pull off. It\u2019s brutally hot. \u2014Eve Barlow\n\nClairo, \u201cBags\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a kid, you\u2019ve probably heard of Clairo \u2014 she\u2019s the 20-year-old internet-pop micro-phenom who broke sorta-big in 2017 with \u201cFlaming Hot Cheetos\u201d and has since opened for Dua Lipa and worked with the similarly post-juvenile, genre-blending Cuco. And if you\u2019re an adult who follows the general trajectory of popular music? You\u2019re probably going to end up needing to form an opinion on Clairo this year, and \u201cBags\u201d \u2014 which may or may not end up on her proper full-length debut that should be dropping later in 2019 \u2014 is a good place to start trying to figure out what\u2019s up with her. The song was co-produced by Rostam and is cloaked with dusky guitars and close-mic\u2019d vocals that will remind any aging millennial of what it was like to listen to Bright Eyes with wide eyes, or any of the early-t", "description": "Looking for something new to listen to?
