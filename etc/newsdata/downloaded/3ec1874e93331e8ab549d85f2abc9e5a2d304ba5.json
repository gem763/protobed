Other objects of desire are a little more taste-based. What\u2019s the next status water bottle or hand wash, for instance? Chris Black (he\u2019s a partner at brand consultancy Public Announcement) is here to help, in the form of a regular column. If you have a burning question about the next fanny pack or Noah rugby shirt, drop us an email with the subject line \u201cAsk Chris\u201d at strategist@nymag.com.\n\nIf you were forced to wear business-casual attire to the office, what would your work wardrobe look like?\n\nAbsolutely, positively, could not be me, TBH. But for the sake of this column, we can pretend. This is an excellent opportunity to flirt with uniform dressing. Keep the palette simple and the cuts flattering, baby!\n\nAcne Studios Navy Ishir Trousers Start with some navy pants from Acne. They\u2019re easy to wear with a button-down \u2014 straight-leg cotton twill is not hard to pull off \u2014 and surprisingly well-priced, considering that Acne stuff typically holds up for several years. On days that are more business than casual, these will also pair well with a blazer worn over your shirt. $240 at SSENSE Buy\n\nBrooks Brothers Regent Fit Oxford Sport Shirt Of course, you\u2019ll probably want \u2014 no need \u2014 a good button-down or two. I\u2019ve already gone in on my favorites, but for your purposes, I will reiterate my praise for Brooks Brothers\u2019 Regent Fit Oxford Sport Shirt, which comes in light blue in addition to white. It is heavy-duty (meaning it will last) and cut slimmer, which is always a good look for a button-down. $140 at Brooks Brothers Buy\n\nUniqlo Men Pile-lined Fleece Cardigan If you need an extra layer, Uniqlo\u2019s fluffy cardigan made of so-called Sherpa fleece is perfect for staying warm when your boss refuses to turn down the air-conditioning. Keep it tonal. $40 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nDr. Martens Adrian The Dr. Martens Adrian tassel loafer in smooth black leather has a nice chunky sole, but can still pass for business casual. I think? The shoes are cool, regardless! Now go hang out by the water cooler in style. $130 at Zappos Buy\n\nWhat are your thoughts on leather jackets?\n\nThey seem to work well for basic girls that work in \u201cmarketing\u201d and have unlocked black status on the Sweetgreen app. They also work for anyone who rides a motorcycle or has a personal shopper at John Varvatos. For me, I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t own a Harley or a Telecaster.\n\nSchott 50s Perfecto Leather Biker Jacket Still, when done right, a leather jacket can look very cool. The Schott Perfecto is really the blueprint for this stuff. It came out in 1928, introducing us to the signature asymmetrical zipper and large snap-down lapels. It has been worn by every male icon you can think of, from Lou Reed to Marlon Brando to Kanye West to Bruce Springsteen. If you can do it, justice and godspeed. Rock and Roll High School is now in session! $880 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nHelmut Lang Black Leather Masc Trucker Jacket I have always liked a leather version of the timeless, hard-wearing trucker silhouette, like this one from Helmut Lang. The simple cut makes it much more approachable in black leather. $1,495 at SSENSE Buy\n\nMr P. Shearling-Trimmed Leather Bomber Jacket The shearling trimmed leather bomber strikes me as particularly wearable by most guys. It\u2019s cool, but not extreme, and works well in colder climates. The large front pockets can hold your personal effects, and the cut is slightly roomier than a lot of leather styles. This updated version from Mr P. is a slick update on the \u201980s classic. $1,250 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nI realized I have no beanies for the coming season. What are some good options outside of the par-for-the-course Noah logo beanie?\n\nAh, yes, the beanie \u2014 or as our friends from Canada call it, the toque. An essential part of anyone\u2019s winter wardrobe. The fit is crucial as we all must avoid the dreaded Saggy Beanie\u2122, popularized by Los Angeles\u2013based club promoters and out of work actors. Allow me to assist.\n\nInverallan Aran Hat Keep it traditional with this chunky lambswool cable-knit beanie in oatmeal from Scottish label Inverallan. It will warm your dome during those chilly winter walks on the beach in Nantucket with your father-in-law. $65 at End Clothing Buy\n\nHowlin' King Jammy Hat Another cozy-looking option, this pink lambswool number from Howlin\u2019 is the cheerful pop of color we all need for the dreary winter season. It is the perfect shade to garner some grins! $55 at End Clothing Buy\n\nGroveland Time Beanie If you are looking to make even more of a statement, this \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d beanie in safety orange from Groveland will do the trick. The color guarantees hunters won\u2019t mistake you for deer while hiking through the woods to observe fall foliage.
