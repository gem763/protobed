I won\u2019t lie, it was a huge shock when she told us she was pregnant and I was heartbroken at the time. Now, though, she has a beautiful little boy, we\u2019ve all rallied round to support her and\n\nthey\u2019re both doing really well. We\u2019re hoping she\u2019ll be able to return to studying next year.\n\nMy problem is her ex-boyfriend\u2019s family who want nothing to do with the baby. They blame my daughter for everything and believe their \u201cgolden boy\u201d was lured into this relationship and therefore has no responsibility for the child or my daughter. They\u2019d already split up by the time my \u00addaughter realised she was expecting.\n\nMy daughter is OK with it, but I\u2019m angry. Why would they be so small-minded and, quite frankly, stupid?\n\nThis boy isn\u2019t daft \u2013 he\u2019s \u00adactually very clever, and therein lies the problem.\n\nI don\u2019t think his parents want his university ambitions to suffer because he\u2019s a father.\n\nThey\u2019re panicking about him being distracted and getting back together with my daughter, although I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what she wants.\n\nHave you any ideas on how I can navigate this situation?\n\nColeen says\n\nI don\u2019t think you can or should make someone be involved if the desire isn\u2019t there. Your daughter seems at peace with things and is focused on her little boy. She\u2019s accepted she\u2019s a single mum and is doing well with your support.\n\nSo a big pat on the back to you and your family for handling things the way you have.\n\nThe way I\u2019d see it is it\u2019s their hard luck if they\u2019re missing out on this gorgeous little boy. However, once your daughter\u2019s ex starts working and earning a wage, he should be paying for his child.\n\nBut of course I get why you\u2019re angry \u2013 it\u2019s almost like your daughter got pregnant on her own and he had no part in it!\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll change their minds \u2013 I think you need to leave the ball in their court.\n\nTry to look at the positives \u2013 you don\u2019t want to be so eaten up by anger and bitterness that you don\u2019t enjoy this special time.\n\nAnd do you really want these people in your lives right now when you know how they feel?\n\nIt\u2019s challenging being a lone parent, so your daughter doesn\u2019t need the added stress of two families at war.", "description": "My 16-year-old daughter had a baby but her ex-boyfriend\u2019s family have shunned us", "authors": ["Coleen Nolan"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20641738.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GP12395353.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
