Despite this, lawyers maintain that XRP is not a security.\n\nNow, however, confidence in their claims appears strangely absent. As fellow industry lawyer Jake Chervinsky notes, none of the twelve rebuffs tackle XRP\u2019s status as a security.\n\n\u201cRipple has finally filed their motion to dismiss in the pending securities class action regarding XRP. They make twelve separate arguments for dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s claims,\u201d he summarized on Twitter.\n\n\u201cNot a single one squarely addresses whether XRP is an unregistered security.\u201d\n\nIs XRP A Security?\n\nIndeed, the only explicit reference to the issue appears in a footnote in the latest document. It reads:\n\nPurchasing XRP is not an \u2018investment\u2019 in Ripple; there is no common enterprise between Ripple and XRP purchasers; there was no promise that Ripple would help generate profits for XRP holders; and the XRP ledger\u2026 is decentralized\u2026 Moreover, because XRP is a currency, it cannot, as a matter of law, also be a security.\n\nThe grounds for throwing out the lawsuit meanwhile focus on Sostack\u2019s reported failure to prove he had grounds to sue on the premises he mentioned previously.\n\nAmong them is timing: Sostack should have a maximum of three years to bring about action after XRP\u2019s initial sale. As this was in 2013, he did so too late, the lawyers argue.\n\nFor other XRP investors meanwhile, the legal activities have had little impact on markets. As Bitcoinist reported, the token currently trades near multi-year lows against Bitcoin. A bull run this week was cut short by Bitcoin\u2019s own fall.\n\nWhat do you think about Ripple\u2019s lawsuit?
