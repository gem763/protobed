REUTERS/Amir Cohen\n\nSettlements are one of the most heated issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinians have voiced fears Netanyahu could defy international consensus and move ahead with annexation with possible backing from U.S. President Donald Trump, a close ally.\n\n\u201cWith God\u2019s help we will extend Jewish sovereignty to all the settlements as part of the (biblical) land of Israel, as part of the state of Israel,\u201d Netanyahu said in Sunday\u2019s speech in the West Bank settlement of Elkana, where he attended a ceremony opening the school year.\n\nHe did not say when he planned to make such a move.\n\nNabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said Netanyahu\u2019s announcement was a \u201ccontinuation of attempts to create an unacceptable fait accompli that will not lead to any peace, security or stability\u201d.\n\nNetanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, made a similar pledge days before an Israeli general election in April. After the vote, he failed to form a governing parliamentary majority and the country will hold a new election on Sept. 17.\n\nHis reaffirmation of the annexation promise came amid a campaign push to draw supporters of far-right factions to Likud in the coming election, in which votes are cast for a party\u2019s list of parliamentary candidates.\n\nIn power for the past decade, but with corruption charges looming, Netanyahu has cautioned that Likud needs to emerge with a decisive lead in the ballot or Israel\u2019s president might choose another candidate to form a governing coalition after the race.\n\nNetanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in three criminal investigations against him. Likud is running neck-and-neck in opinion polls with the centrist Blue and White party led by former armed forces chief Benny Gantz.\n\nGOLAN ANNEXATION\n\nWith publication of a U.S. peace plan still pending, Trump has already recognized Israel\u2019s 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights, land captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nPalestinians seek to make the West Bank part of a future state that would include the Gaza Strip and have East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel seized those areas in 1967 and moved troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005.\n\n\u201cThis is our land,\u201d Netanyahu said in his speech in Elkana. \u201cWe will build another Elkana and another Elkana and another Elkana. We will not uproot anyone here.\u201d\n\nMore than 400,000 Israelis now live in the West Bank, according to Israeli figures, among a Palestinian population put at about 2.9 million by the Palestinian Statistics Bureau.\n\nA further 212,000 Israeli settlers live in East Jerusalem, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Palestinians and many countries consider settlements to be illegal under the Geneva Conventions that bar settling on land captured in war. Israel disputes this, citing security needs and biblical, historical and political connections to the land.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intends to annex all Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, he said on Sunday, reiterating an election promise made five months ago but again giving no timeframe.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190901&t=2&i=1424995812&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF801BT"}
