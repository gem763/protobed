Footage was then played which showed Miss Pownall trying to separate the two women, before Taylor was 'pulled away' from the row.\n\nMr Hall said it could then be seen that Taylor 'reaches over and strikes Miss Binns to the face with a beer bottle'.\n\nThe victim, who couldn't see out of her left eye and felt a painful 'burning sensation' to her head, was taken to hospital.\n\nTaylor was seen posing for a photo with a thumbs up, as her girlfriend Rebecca Pownall took a picture\n\nThe judge, Recorder Terence Rigby, said: 'Whilst it looked as though it might be quite dangerous for a while, it appears there was no lasting problem.'\n\nMiss Binns told the court her children were upset and she couldn't play with them in the days afterwards, becoming dizzy when carrying one upstairs.\n\nThe victim feared repercussions for reporting the incident, asked friends to stay at her home and kept blinds closed and doors locked, and left the property.\n\nShe felt self-conscious and paranoid about the bruising to her eye and needed new medication for pre-existing depression.\n\nMr Hall added: 'She describes a multitude of emotions, including anger, paranoia, distress and fear.'\n\nThe attack happened at the Insomnia night club in St Helens, Merseyside (pictured above)\n\nRecorder Rigby noted there was a suggestion of 'some sort of threats' being made afterwards on Facebook.\n\nMr Hall said Miss Binns received a message from Miss Pownall asking about her welfare 'but also perhaps gently persuading her not to report the matter to the police'.\n\nThe lawyer said Miss Binns also reported a post, which she believed came from Taylor's Facebook page, calling her a 'grass'.\n\nHe said: 'It refers to Christy Binns by name and also quote 'there's money waiting' - perhaps a veiled threat, but I understand that's not agreed.'\n\nTaylor is being made to attend a 20-day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement and will also had to pay \u00a31,000 compensation\n\nHowever, Brendan Carville, defending, said: 'The defendant doesn't have a Facebook account. She is not the authoress of that document.'\n\nTaylor admitted assault causing actual bodily harm, has 10 previous convictions for 19 offences. She has a string of convictions for violence, including an assault in a takeaway, and has served time in jail.\n\nTaylor was also convicted of assault causing actual bodily harm in November 2016, for an attack on her mother, and was last sentenced in May 2017 for an assault in a pub.\n\nThe court heard doctors were investigating whether she may have ADHD and she was on anti-depressants, but didn't want to take them because of 'side effects'.\n\nMr Carville said she had stopped taking the medicine and quit drinking according to a letter from Miss Pownall.\n\nHe said: 'It's only seven months or so since this offence occurred, but given the defendant's record, it's almost a miracle she hasn't offended in the interim period.'\n\nMr Carville said Taylor was working at a warehouse, earning \u00a3300 a week, and while she shouldn't 'try and buy her way out of this', she could pay compensation.\n\nHe urged the judge to spare her jail and said while it was a 'nasty offence' that ended their friendship, the victim fortunately recovered.\n\nRecorder Rigby said hitting someone with a glass or bottle was always 'very serious'.\n\nHe said: 'You hit her very close to her eye and you so easily could have injured her eye, so that she might not have been able to see through that eye ever again.'\n\nHowever, he said in Taylor's favour was an early guilty plea and that she was tackling her problems, 'a combination of volatility and drink'.\n\nRecorder Rigby said: 'I'm prepared to accept that you have addressed your drink problem and therefore have reduced the risk of losing your temper, as you appear to have done on many occasions in your life.'\n\nThe judge said Taylor hadn't committed any offences for two years beforehand, which 'demonstrates that you can keep out of trouble'.\n\nHe said he believed Miss Pownall was 'obviously the stabilising influence that you frankly have never had before in your life'.\n\nRecorder Rigby said: 'The public might well be concerned when a court doesn't send somebody to prison for committing an offence such as this.\n\n'But it's not the public making this decision, it's me.'\n\nHe handed her 36 weeks in jail, suspended for two years, and ordered her to pay \u00a31,000 in compensation.\n\nThe judge told Taylor to attend a 20-day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement and made a five-year restraining order.", "description": "Danielle Taylor hit Christy Binns in the face in the drunken attack on a nightclub dance floor in St Helens, Merseyside.
