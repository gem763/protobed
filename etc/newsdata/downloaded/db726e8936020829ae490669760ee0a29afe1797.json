Annexation would deal a body blow to the Palestinians\u2019 dreams of establishing an independent state with the West Bank as its heartland.\n\nThose dreams have steadily eroded since December 2017, when the Trump administration recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital over the objections of the Palestinians, who claim the city\u2019s eastern sector for a future capital. A senior Palestinian official called Netanyahu\u2019s plan \u201cmadness.\u201d\n\nUN Alarm\n\n\u201cIf Prime Minister Netanyahu is allowed to implement his plans of annexation, he would have succeeded in burying even any chance of peace between Palestinians and Israelis,\u201d said Saeb Erekat, a longtime peace negotiator and now secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization. \u201cThe Israeli, the international community must stop such madness. We need to end the conflict and not to keep it for another 100 years.\u201d\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed alarm over Netanyahu\u2019s pledge on Wednesday, saying such steps would be a blow to peace efforts.\n\n\u201cSuch steps, if implemented, would constitute a serious violation of international law,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThey would be devastating to the potential of reviving negotiations and regional peace, while severely undermining the viability of the two-State solution.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. was informed of the announcement before it was made, and doesn\u2019t think annexation would foreclose the possibility of a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Times of Israel website reported.\n\nLater Tuesday, militants from the Gaza Strip fired two rockets at southern Israeli cities, including one where Netanyahu was holding an election rally. Netanyahu\u2019s security detail hustled him off the stage at a campaign event in Ashdod after air raid sirens went off.\n\nThe rockets were intercepted by missile defenses, and early Wednesday, the Israeli air force struck 15 military targets in Gaza in retaliation.\n\nOnce Taboo\n\nAnnexation of West Bank territory, captured in the 1967 Middle East war, had been considered taboo for decades in Israeli politics because of the international outcry it would spark. But as religious and nationalist political parties gained clout, and peacemaking with the Palestinians drifted off the country\u2019s agenda amid continuing Palestinian attacks, the notion has come to resonate with large swaths of the Israeli public.\n\nAccording to an August poll by the Israel Democracy Institute, 48% of Jewish Israelis and 11% of Arab Israelis would favor such a plan if it were supported by President Donald Trump and his administration. This compares to 28% of Jewish Israelis and 56% of Arab Israelis who oppose the idea.\n\nNetanyahu said the first area to be annexed if he\u2019s re-elected would be the Jordan Valley, where Israeli forces now guard the country\u2019s eastern flank with Jordan. There is wide support for such a move in Israel, including on the part of Netanyahu\u2019s top election rival, former military chief Benny Gantz of the Blue and White bloc.\n\nDangling the prospect of annexation is a gambit Netanyahu has used before. Three days before Israel\u2019s April 9 poll, and again last week, he suggested he\u2019d extend Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank that are home to Jewish settlements if re-elected. Polls show his Likud party in a tight race with Blue and White, and Netanyahu has been warning nationalists that if they don\u2019t vote for his slate, then his right-wing government will be toppled.\n\nEndorsing a proposal that has become the battle cry of other hawkish politicians might burnish his nationalist credentials.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he\u2019d annex West Bank territory if re-elected next week, in a brazen ploy to bag right-wing votes ahead of the expected knife-edge vote.The Trump administration will unveil its plan for Middle East peace days after Israel\u2019s Sept. 17 election", "authors": ["Alisa Odenheimer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PJbf3GpgAJnoVSwlId9r7g--~B/aD0yNjI1O3c9MzkzODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/6f1f7dff0ba0dd2fe3cf7f0ef8d60f18", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
