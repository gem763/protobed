In the early hours of Sept. 2, Labor Day, a fire broke out on the lower levels of the boat, which had been anchored just off the shore of Santa Cruz Island. Thirty-four people died.\n\nThe NTSB\u2019s two-page report states that the five crew members who survived were asleep on the uppermost level when the fire began. They told investigators that the sixth crew member, who died alongside the boat\u2019s 33 passengers, was also asleep in the bunk room on the lower deck, agency spokesman Eric Weiss said.\n\nThe report, which is the first of three the NTSB will release in its ongoing investigation, was based on witness testimonies, interviews with crew members and evidence collected on-site. It does not include causes of the fire.\n\nInitial findings \u201craise the question of whether there was a roving watchman on duty,\u201d Weiss said. He emphasized that it is too early to determine whether a violation was made.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard said in a statement to The Washington Post that according to its certificate of inspection, the Conception was required to have a roving watchman on duty. The Coast Guard directed The Post to a set of government regulations stating that for a passenger vessel like the one involved in the Sept. 2 fire, \u201cThe owner, charterer, master, or managing operator of a vessel \u2026 shall have a suitable number of watchmen patrol throughout the vessel during the nighttime, whether or not the vessel is underway, to guard against, and give alarm in case of, a fire, man overboard, or other dangerous situation.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives of Truth Aquatics, the Santa Barbara company that operated the Conception, declined to comment when contacted directly.\n\nDouglas Schwartz, the company\u2019s lawyer said in a statement to The Post that there is \u201cwitness testimony that seems to contradict the notion that the entire crew was asleep.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe do know that one crew member checked on and around the galley area at around 2:30 a.m., approximately 30 minutes before the fire broke out.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the Coast Guard issued a bulletin that outlined new emergency safety requirements for passenger vessels. Among its list of six recommendations, it called on boat owners and operators to review \u201cthe routes and conditions listed on the vessel\u2019s Certificate of Inspection,\u201d as well as the \u201cemergency duties and responsibilities with the crew.\u201d\n\n\n\nA memorial for the victims of the Conception at the Santa Barbara Harbor. (Christian Monterrosa/AP)\n\nThe last victim from the Sept. 2 fire was located this Wednesday, the Santa Barbara Sheriff\u2019s Office reported. DNA testing is still underway to identify seven of the 34 fatalities.\n\nAccording to the NTSB report, the fire was discovered when a crew member sleeping in the upper deck was awakened by a noise and got up to investigate. When others were alerted to the fire, the captain sent a distress message to the Coast Guard. Crew members tried to enter the salon and the galley compartment in the main deck, but were unable to because it was consumed by the fire.\n\n\u201cUnable to open the window and overwhelmed by smoke, the crew jumped overboard,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe five crew members, including the captain, boarded a small boat before transferring to a recreational vessel nearby where they continued to signal for help. Two from this group later returned to the vessel to search for survivors.\n\nThe NTSB will release two more reports in the next 18 to 24 months, Weiss said. The next one will be a complete factual account of what occurred and the final report will include analysis, probable causes and safety recommendations.", "description": "A lawyer for Truth Aquatics, the Santa Barbara company that operated the \"Conception,\" disputed the idea that the entire crew was asleep.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "Rebecca Tan Is A Reporter Working On The Local Desk In D.C.
