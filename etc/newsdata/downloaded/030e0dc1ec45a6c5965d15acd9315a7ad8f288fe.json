(Yodsapon Kerdviboon, The Isaan Record, AFP)\n\nA Thai anti-junta activist who spent more than two years behind bars for insulting the country's monarchy by sharing an unflattering BBC article about the king walked free on Friday on a royal pardon.\n\nJatupat \"Pai Dao Din\" Boonpatararaksa, 27, was greeted by hundreds of jubilant family and friends after leaving the Khon Kaen provincial prison.\n\n\"I'm not angry with anyone, I only love democracy and freedom,\" he said in a video broadcast on Facebook, adding he would continue with his activism.\n\nThe pardon comes days after King Maha Vajiralongkorn was crowned over the weekend in Thailand's first coronation in 69 years.\n\nThe country has some of the harshest royal insult \u2013 known as lese-majeste \u2013 laws in the world and each count carries a maximum prison term of 15 years.\n\nThe law, or article 112, makes scrutiny of the wealthy and powerful royal family all but impossible inside the kingdom \u2013 including by the media who have to heavily self-censor.\n\nJatupat was found guilty after sharing a profile of King Maha Vajiralongkorn written by the BBC's Thai-language service in London.\n\nThe profile contained details of 66-year-old Vajiralongkorn's personal life that are well known inside the kingdom but rarely printed by the Thai press.\n\nIt was shared more than 2 000 times but Jatupat was the only person prosecuted.\n\nAnother pro-democracy activist who shared the article fled the country after facing similar charges.\n\nJatupat expressed gratitude to Vajiralongkorn for the pardon.\n\n\"It's the mercy of the king and I am grateful.\"\n\nThe activist was the first to be detained after Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne following the death of his beloved father Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016.\n\nLese-majeste convictions shot up under the arch-royalist junta that seized power in a 2014 coup, but analysts say the trend has reversed under Vajiralongkorn.\n\nThose charged with lese majeste in Thailand are almost always convicted, often behind closed doors.\n\nJatupat had originally been sentenced to five years but the sentence was halved after he pleaded guilty.\n\nHis lawyer said the sentence would have ended on June 19.\n\nAbout 30 000 to 50 000 prisoners are expected to be released under royal pardons and many will have sentences reduced, according to the corrections department.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "A Thai anti-junta activist who spent more than two years behind bars for insulting the country's monarchy by sharing an unflattering BBC article about the king walked free on a royal pardon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8851/e83d8bf58afb467aaa221cefe508da68.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-10"}
