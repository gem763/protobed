Her Name Is Mila", "language": "en", "text": "Julia Vitarello with her daughter Mila, 8, who has a rare neurological disorder, at their home in Longmont, Colo., Oct. 9, 2019. (Nick Cote/The New York Times)\n\nA new drug, created to treat just one patient, has pushed the bounds of personalized medicine and has raised unexplored regulatory and ethical questions, scientists reported Wednesday.\n\nThe drug, described in the New England Journal of Medicine, is believed to be the first \u201ccustom\u201d treatment for a genetic disease. It is called milasen, named after the only patient who will ever take it: Mila (mee-lah) Makovec, who lives with her mother, Julia Vitarello, in Longmont, Colorado.\n\nMila, 8, has a rapidly progressing neurological disorder that is fatal. Her symptoms started at age 3. Within a few years, she had gone from an agile, talkative child to one who was blind and unable to stand or hold up her head. She needed a feeding tube and experienced up to 30 seizures a day, each lasting one or two minutes.\n\nVitarello learned in December 2016 that Mila had Batten\u2019s disease. But the girl\u2019s case was puzzling, doctors said. Batten\u2019s disease is recessive \u2014 a patient must inherit two mutated versions of a gene, MFSD8, to develop the disease.\n\nMila had just one mutated gene, and the other copy seemed normal. That should have been sufficient to prevent the disease.\n\nIn March 2017, Dr. Timothy Yu and his colleagues at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital discovered that the problem with the intact gene lay in an extraneous bit of DNA that had scrambled the manufacturing of an important protein.\n\nThat gave Yu an idea: Why not make a custom piece of RNA to block the effects of the extraneous DNA? Developing such a drug would be expensive, but there were no other options.\n\nVitarello already had set up Mila\u2019s Miracle Foundation and was appealing for donations on GoFundMe. So, she began fundraising in earnest, eventually raising $3 million for a variety of research efforts.\n\nYu\u2019s team oversaw development of the drug, tested it in rodents, and consulted with the Food and Drug Administration. In January 2018, the agency granted permission to give the drug to Mila. She got her first dose on Jan. 31, 2018.\n\nThe drug was delivered through a spinal tap, so it could reach her brain. Within a month, Vitarello noticed a difference. Mila was having fewer seizures, and they were not lasting as long.\n\nWith continued treatments, the number of seizures has diminished so much that the girl has between zero and six a day, and they last less than a minute.\n\nMila rarely needs the feeding tube now, and is able once again to eat pur\u00e9ed foods. She cannot stand unassisted, but when she is held upright, her neck and back are straight, no longer slumped.\n\nStill, Mila has lost the last few words of her vocabulary and remains severely disabled.\n\n\u201cShe is starting not to respond to things that made her laugh or smile,\u201d Vitarello said.\n\nMilasen is believed to be the first drug developed for a single patient (CAR-T cancer therapies, while individualized, are not drugs). But the path forward is not clear, Yu and his colleagues acknowledged.\n\nThere are more than 7,000 rare diseases, and more than 90% have no FDA-approved treatment, according to Rachel Sher, vice president of regulatory and government affairs at the National Organization for Rare Disorders.\n\nTens of thousands of patients could be in Mila\u2019s situation in the United States alone. But there are nowhere near enough researchers to make custom drugs for all who might want them.\n\nAnd even if there were, who would pay? Not the federal government, not drug companies and not insurers, said Dr. Steven Joffe, professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, that leaves it to families,\u201d he added. \u201cIt feels awfully uncomfortable, but that is the reality.\u201d\n\nThat means custom drugs would be an option only for the very wealthy, those with the skills to raise large sums of money, or those who gain the support of foundations.\n\nMila\u2019s drug development was mostly paid for by the foundation run by her mother, but she and Yu declined to say how much was spent.\n\nThe idea of custom drugs also leads the FDA into uncharted territory. In an editorial published with Yu\u2019s paper, Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, raised tough questions:\n\nWhat type of evidence is needed before exposing a human to a new drug? Even in rapidly progressing, fatal illnesses, precipitating severe complications or death is not acceptable, so what is the minimum assurance of safety that is needed?", "description": "A new drug, created to treat just one patient, has pushed the bounds of personalized medicine and has raised unexplored regulatory and ethical questions, scientists reported Wednesday.The drug, described in the New England Journal of Medicine, is believed to be the first \"custom\" treatment", "authors": ["Gina Kolata"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dLUDGt025_FqDMc.Sx6AxA--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/6c447db5e88794c4fe0e28cbf92049bb", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
