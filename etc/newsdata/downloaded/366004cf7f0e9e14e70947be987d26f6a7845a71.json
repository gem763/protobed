Her children would, in turn, be expected to walk dry-eyed behind her coffin. The family still mostly takes its lead from the Queen\u2019s constitutional obligation to conceal her feelings, recognising that her rockiest moments have come when asked to reveal more than is comfortable \u2013 during Scotland\u2019s independence referendum, or when the unexpected national wave of grief over Diana\u2019s death left the family looking dangerously stiff. The younger royals have pushed the boundaries by discussing their mental health, but raw, unfiltered emotion is still regarded as suspiciously bad for business. Imagine the concern, then, at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s insistence on showing some.\n\nPrince Harry\u2019s outburst this week against a tabloid media he feels has trashed his wife is said to have been made against aides\u2019 advice, and the statement certainly reads like he wrote it himself. Announcing a landmark legal case against the Mail on Sunday, over its publication of a private letter from Meghan to her estranged father, the prince raged that the couple would not endure \u201cpainful\u201d intrusions in silence. Having lost his mother, his greatest fear was watching someone else he loved become \u201ccommoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person\u201d.\n\nWhy is Meghan suing the Mail on Sunday? Read more\n\nThe bad news for the Sussexes, however, is that this is exactly what celebrity culture does. They are part of an industry based on real lives being tidily repackaged for public consumption and sold on for profit \u2013 or in the Windsors\u2019 case, public subsidy \u2013 and one in which feelings are little more than an inconvenience. \u201cI used to read magazines when I was little and see all these Hollywood people break up and they didn\u2019t feel like real people,\u201d TV presenter Maya Jama explained this week, talking about her public breakup with the grime star Stormzy. \u201cAnd then when you\u2019re in that position, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh shit it\u2019s very real\u2019. Everybody just sees it as entertainment.\u201d\n\nThe private lives of celebrities \u2013 which is essentially what the young royals are \u2013 have become another part of the show, with actors berated if they won\u2019t spill their guts about their private lives in interviews to promote the movie. Buy a cinema ticket, or pay for a princess\u2019s expensive house renovations, and punters expect to own a piece of you.\n\nYet there\u2019s something creepy about the clamour for the Sussexes to put out; to cough up more \u201cproper\u201d pictures of baby Archie \u2013 none of those coy Instagram shots, revealing a tiny hand but little else \u2013 and quit whining about invasion of privacy. The argument is reminiscent of drunk suits braying at a lap dancer they don\u2019t feel has gone far enough for the money; so what if Meghan wants to keep some things private, to maintain at least some kind of boundary? She took the cash! She doesn\u2019t get to choose! Somewhere beneath all of this, meanwhile, lurk uglier assumptions that this particular princess \u2013 a mixed-race American divorcee from an ordinary background \u2013 might be fair game in a way other royal brides were not.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Frogmore Cottage, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s home: \u2018Buy a cinema ticket, or pay for a princess\u2019s expensive country house renovations, and punters expect to own a piece of you.\u2019 Photograph: REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe royal family cost the nation \u00a382m in the last financial year. It\u2019s an obscene amount of money for one family and doubtless most of us could envisage better ways of spending it, but boils down to \u00a32.65 per taxpayer per year. How much of someone\u2019s intimate family life anyone should expect to buy for the price of a takeaway coffee is a tricky question. But as a rough guide, the devil offered Faust eternal life in exchange for his soul.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the Sussexes\u2019 novel court case will succeed, still less that it will solve a journalistic dilemma that is as much moral as legal. This isn\u2019t one of those landmark cases pitting privacy against the public interest \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see what higher cause is served by knowing exactly how upset Meghan was with her father \u2013 but nor is it a classic tale of journalistic malpractice.\n\nThe Duchess\u2019s privacy was invaded not via a long lens, rifled dustbin or hacked phone, but by her own father, who shared the letter with the newspaper after his daughter\u2019s friends criticised him in a magazine article, and one suspects it\u2019s the personal betrayal that really stings. (The couple claim the letter was edited to make Meghan look bad, but their case is primarily based on a mix of privacy, copyright and data protection legislation rather than libel law; if he can\u2019t be persuaded to stop talking about what is obviously a difficult relationship, the aim is presumably to put whatever her father says off limits.)\n\nThe closest parallel is perhaps with the cricketer Ben Stokes\u2019s attack on the Sun for revealing details of a family tragedy that happened before he was born. Although it was a matter of public record in New Zealand, and another relative apparently tipped off the paper, Stokes\u2019s argument that his mother shouldn\u2019t be forced to relive such memories just because her son is famous struck home. It\u2019s easier not to think about the human fallout of a juicy story, just as it\u2019s easier not to think about the relationship between a plastic-wrapped pork chop and a live pig, but that doesn\u2019t magic it away.\n\nSo put aside, just for a moment, perfectly legitimate questions about whether the eco-conscious Sussexes take too many private jets or Harry is overly sensitive. Strip away the impossibly gilded lives, and what\u2019s left is the product of two damaged childhoods; the motherless son and the woman whose father failed to show at her wedding. For those who want their money\u2019s worth, the pound of flesh they paid to see, here it is in all its naked glory. But it\u2019s the crowd, not the people stripped bare before them, who seem diminished by the sight.\n\n\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Prince Harry\u2019s attack on the tabloid media is a justified assertion of the couple\u2019s right to some shreds of privacy, says Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dfc4d2ce93010ebebd8507c34288e4b2ba71b08/0_426_2635_1581/master/2635.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=006f16353eb11a9a8fe84c2a13e98167", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
