We stand in solidarity with the youngsters.\"\n\nImage caption Gaynor, 66, with Marianne, 72, who said they were there to protect \"all species\" on Earth\n\nSatnam Kaur Khalsa, 63, from Hounslow, was joined at the protest by her daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren, all who travelled from Mexico for the ongoing rallies.\n\n\"I want to help make sure there is a place for these children to live and prosper,\" said Ms Kaur Khalsa, \"Like we had an opportunity to when we were young.\n\n\"We could plan our future. Their future is murky at the moment, they don't know what's going to happen.\n\n\"We didn't really think of the consequences.\"\n\nMs Kaur Khalsa's daughter, Harmeet, who has lived in Mexico for the past 15 years, said she wanted to join the Extinction Rebellion movement after seeing footage of the earlier rallies in April.\n\nImage caption Satnam Kaur Khalsa, 63, right, with daughter Harmeet Kaur and grandsons Kirpa and Rollo\n\n\"Watching the footage in London, we made plans to join my mum,\" said Harmeet, 42, a former freelance travel writer who now works in teaching. \"We will be here for a few months.\"\n\nShe added that people in the mountain village where she lived in Mexico were \"worried\" about the impact of climate change, after temperatures were unexpectedly high earlier this year.\n\nAlso at the protest was playwright and novelist Michael Frayn, 86, who said he was introduced to the Extinction Rebellion cause by his grandson, Jack Harries, a YouTuber and environmental activist.\n\nJack was arrested at a protest in April, and said: \"Granddad wrote me a witness statement for court. That was what started the dialogue.\n\n\"It feels like a really significant moment for him to be here.\"\n\nImage caption Michael Frayn, 86, with his grandchildren Eliza and Jack outside Buckingham Palace\n\nMr Frayn said he has seven grandchildren and does not want to see their lives \"blighted or cut short\" by climate change.\n\nMeanwhile, for Imogen Sibona, a 60-year-old small business owner from New Malden, the fact that older people may have more time is also a reason why it's important for them to protest.\n\nShe said: \"I work part time and I'm able to use some time to come here,\" she said. \"My kids can't. Most people have not got much time on their hands.\"\n\nImage caption Climate change is \"not a political position or belief system\", says Imogen Sibona\n\nLed by two musicians, the crowd, gathered on the steps of the Queen Victoria Memorial, also sang songs with the lyrics: \"In the voice of my great granddaughter, climate justice now,\" and, \"We are rebelling to save our children.\"\n\nFor many of the campaigners outside the palace, it was not their first time at a rally.\n\nGilly Hatch, 74, a painter originally from New York but who lives in north London, said she had been protesting since the Vietnam War.\n\nBut she stressed she did not enjoy it, because of her dislike of crowds.\n\nImage caption Gilly Hatch, from Tufnell Park in London, protests despite not liking crowds\n\nHer presence is testament to the importance she places on the cause. \"It's the most important issue we face at the moment,\" she said.\n\n\"I have a granddaughter and think that makes it feel more intense and important.\n\n\"But it's not just for her, it's for everybody.\"", "description": "Despite a London-wide police ban, a group called Extinction Rebellion Grandparents continue to protest.", "authors": ["Francesca Gillett", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3DA8/production/_109248751_group.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
