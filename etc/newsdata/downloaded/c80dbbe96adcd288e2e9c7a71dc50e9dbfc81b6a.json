Here's why you may be prone to scary dreams", "language": "en", "text": "They terrorize us in the middle of the night with frightening images that are vivid and feel all too real, making our hearts pound and our bodies drip with sweat. They force some to re-live car accidents, house fires, and other traumatic events, while others scramble to avoid monsters or ghosts.\n\nSuddenly, we snap awake. Our bodies lurch forward and we breathe a sigh of relief in realization it was just a nightmare.\n\n\u201cOccasional nightmares are a normal part of dreaming and can provide valuable insight into our psychological and spiritual lives,\u201d Rubin Naiman, psychologist and clinical assistant professor of medicine at the University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, writes in the paper \u201cDreamless: the silent epidemic of REM sleep loss.\u201d\n\nWISCONSIN MAN DETERMINED TO WALK AGAIN AFTER LOSING LIMBS TO DOG LICK INFECTION\n\nFor others, frightening dreams are a chronic condition.\n\nTrauma survivors \u2014 specifically those suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) \u2014 are more likely to experience nightmares. In fact, while only 2.5 to 10 percent of adults experience nightmares, according to the Sleep Health Foundation, up to 90 percent of those with PTSD have reported \u201cdisturbing dreams with some degree of resemblance to the actual traumatic event,\u201d according to a report co-authored by Anne Germain, a professor of psychiatry and director of the Sleep and Behavioral Neuroscience Center at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.\n\nSeparately, in a study cited by the National Center for PTSD, an agency with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, more than 50 percent of Vietnam War veterans with PTSD said they experienced nightmares \u201cfairly often,\u201d while only 3 percent of civilians reported the same.\n\n\u201cIf there is a traumatic event, these people are more likely to experience nightmares,\u201d Germain told Fox News, explaining nightmares are thought to be the brain\u2019s way of processing a negative experience in an attempt to lower its emotional intensity. But in some instances \u2014 for reasons which are still very much being investigated \u2014 \u201cthe nightmare will stick, becoming the brain\u2019s dreaming pattern,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cA PTSD nightmare feels like the waking world. Except it\u2019s something really, really scary that is happening,\u201d Elizabeth Brico, who said she suffers from the condition as a result of domestic violence, wrote in a May 2017 blog post.\n\n\u201cMy nightmares tend to revolve around being strangled, suffocated, or having my eyes pushed into my head. The feeling is indistinguishable from an actual assault. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe. I feel like there is someone in the bed with me, assaulting me. When I wake up, my brain and body still react to the nightmare as though it were real,\u201d she described.\n\nNightmares can also be associated with other psychiatric diagnoses, such as depression or insomnia. Children, too, can be affected; roughly 10 to 50 percent experience nightmares, according to the Sleep Health Foundation.\n\n\"What is stressful for a child is different from an adult,\u201d Germain noted, explaining children's nightmares are typically triggered by losing a pet or moving away from friends.\n\n\"Once people start paying attention to their dreams, a whole world opens up. ...Dreams can be a parallel to how people see their lives.\u201d \u2014 Rubin Naiman\n\nOthers who suffer from sleep paralysis \u2014 a condition that can be benign or linked to other conditions, such as narcolepsy \u2014 have been known to experience horrifying, dream-like hallucinations while falling asleep or waking up, according to the National Sleep Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe dream experience is just as compelling as being awake,\u201d Naiman told Fox News. \u201cPeople with narcolepsy are among the most intense dreamers.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s those who experience idiopathic nightmares, a type of nightmare that does not occur for any tangible or known reason.\n\nBut when comparing the brains of idiopathic nightmare sufferers and those of controls, Tore Nielsen, director of the Dream and Nightmare Lab at Sacred Heart Hospital in Montreal, told Fox News in an email that he has \u201cnoticed anomalies in their frontal lobes ... in regions that act to put the 'brakes' on excessive emotion that might be activated by the emotion 'engine' centered on the amygdala,\u201d a part of the brain that helps us process emotions such as fear.\n\nIn Nielsen\u2019s other research, which is currently under review, the \u201cseverity of a person's nightmares (in a sample of 18 nightmare-prone individuals), as indexed by their own ratings of how much distress their [nightmares] generally cause, was negatively correlated with blood flow (a measure of brain activity) in these frontal brain regions.\"\n\nIn other words, the higher the distress described by the nightmare sufferer, the lower the blood flow in the frontal brain region.\n\nBoth posttraumatic and idiopathic nightmares sufferers can be affected by the lack of sleep their nightmares tend to cause, as dozing off again after experiencing a scary dream can be difficult. Sleep deprivation has been linked to a variety of health issues, such as weight gain, high blood pressure, negative impacts on both short and long-term memory, mood changes, poor balance, among other side effects.\n\nIn extreme cases, frequent nightmares can \u201cdramatically increase the risk of suicide,\u201d Naiman said.\n\nA 2017 study, conducted by researchers at the University of Turku in Finland echoed Neiman's sentiment, concluding frequent nightmares increase the risk of suicide in both those with PTSD and those without it. Another study from the same year also discovered nightmares are \u201ctemporarily associated with an increased propensity for NSSI [nonsuicidal self-jury],\u201d also known as self-harm.\n\nBut there\u2019s good news: those who experience frequent nightmares \u2014 for both idiopathic or posttraumatic reasons \u2014 can find relief.\n\nPrazosin, a medication that was initially developed to treat high blood pressure, according to Germain, has been effective, particularly for those who suffer from PTSD-induced nightmares.\n\nAnother treatment, imagery rehearsal therapy, has been a useful form of treatment that helps patients \u201creplace\u201d their negative dreams with more positive ones.\n\n\u201cYour brain learns to create these negative scenarios, but you can replace it with something that is more positive, that\u2019s not negative or disturbing,\u201d Germain said.\n\nUS WOMAN DEVELOPS SALMONELLA IN BREAST IMPLANT AFTER TRIP TO CANCUN\n\nBy undergoing imagery rehearsal therapy, patients learn to create a \u201cnew dream scenario\u201d or essentially re-script a recurring nightmare.\n\n\"[In most cases], they start sleeping through the night and stop having nightmares. Some people start having similar dreams to nightmare, but it doesn\u2019t wake them up,\u201d Germain said.\n\nOverall, dreams \u2014 nightmares included \u2014 continue to stump professionals, remaining \u201ca real mystery to scientists and clinicians,\u201d Daniel Barone, associate medical director of the Weill Cornell Center for Sleep Medicine, said.\n\n\u201cWhile there are theories as to why we dream, no one knows for sure,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd while they can be debilitating for some, nightmares can serve as an \"internal healing process,\" Naiman noted.\n\n\"Once people start paying attention to their dreams, a whole world opens up. Dreams can relate to the world at large, what's going on in the community, politically, socially, economically. Dreams can be a parallel to how people see their lives,\" Naiman said.", "description": "Nightmares, an experience most people only have on occasion, are a chronic condition for some.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Rubin Naiman", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
