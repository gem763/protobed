The economy grew 0.1 percent on a yearly basis.\n\nThe decline was led by the manufacturing sector, a pillar of the trade-dependent economy. The sector shrank by 3.5 percent, extending a 3.3 percent contraction the previous quarter.\n\nSingapore\u2019s exports have been hammered by dampened demand as the United States and China slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on each other worth billions of dollars in two-way trade, affecting export demand worldwide.\n\nThe city-state last slipped into recession in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008.", "description": "Singapore (AFP) \u2013 Singapore eased monetary policy for the first time in over three years Monday as the US-China trade war bites, while the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/5339a8_singapore-central-bank-joins-world-in-loosening-policy-as-fears-mount-global-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
