Years of inadequate and delayed federal funding and the Trump Administration\u2019s failed efforts to add an untested citizenship question to the form threaten to reduce participation. Therefore, states should take steps now to help ensure a full and accurate census count.\n\nStates have much at stake in a 2020 census count, including fair representation in Congress and substantial federal funding. House seats are apportioned based on population and, in 2016, the federal government distributed over $900 billion to states and the District of Columbia through 325 census-guided programs and projects including Medicaid, highway planning and construction, child care assistance, and foster care.\n\nStates can help ensure a complete census count by allocating funds to supplement the federal government\u2019s efforts and forming \u201ccomplete count commissions\u201d dedicated to ensuring that everyone living within their borders is counted.\n\nMany Communities at Risk of Not Being Fully Counted\n\nMany communities and population groups are at risk of not being fully counted, including:\n\nYoung children\n\nPeople in rural areas\n\nCommunities of color\n\nPeople who earn low wages\n\nImmigrants\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people\n\nPeople in these communities face significant barriers to census participation for various reasons, including geographic isolation, limited language assistance, limited internet access, housing instability, and anti-immigrant rhetoric by officials that could prompt some immigrants to fear participating in the count.\n\nSuch an undercount could further reinforce barriers to opportunity by denying communities accurate state and federal political representation that\u2019s determined by population numbers; local, state, and federal funds that they might otherwise receive; and private-sector investments, such as jobs and stores, that companies make using census data.\n\n2020 Census Has Been Underfunded; Blocked Citizenship Question Could Chill Participation\n\nUnderfunding and funding delays during key planning and preparation years forced the Census Bureau to cancel key tests and have left it struggling to catch up in the pivotal years before 2020. Additionally, the Administration\u2019s attempts to add an untested citizenship question on the census form disrupted Bureau planning. The Supreme Court rejected the Administration\u2019s rationale for adding the question in June 2019, and the Administration has ceased pursuing the addition. Although the efforts to add the question failed, publicity around them may nevertheless make immigrants more fearful of responding to the census.\n\nStates Can Act to Fully and Accurately Count All Communities\n\nGiven these challenges to an accurate census, states should:\n\nAllocate funding to conduct outreach within their borders and provide other support to supplement the Census Bureau\u2019s outreach and promotion activities, especially in encouraging participation among communities at risk of not being fully counted. These funds can help bolster the efforts of state \u201ccomplete count commissions\u201d (described below) to reach state residents. Seventeen states have allocated such funding to date (see map). Eight states (Colorado, Illinois, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, and Rhode Island) appropriated funds in 2019. States can still contribute to a successful count by allocating funds for outreach in 2020.", "description": "The federal government is responsible for conducting a fair and accurate census every ten years, but that\u2019s in jeopardy for 2020.
