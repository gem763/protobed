Instead he is truth-teller, a healer of divisions and such a moral champion of African Americans they wonder if that Obama chap was a bit overrated.\n\nTo be in the East Room of the White House on Friday afternoon was to step into this alternative reality. More than 200 African American students and young professionals roared with delight and adulation, chanting \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d and pointing camera phones, as Trump walked in and gave a typically jarring speech that veered off teleprompter.\n\nIn this reality, Trump can do no wrong. He is a stand-up comic who lines always land. Millennials praise him for \u201csaving America\u201d and demand \u201cfour more years!\u201d His pal Kanye West is a seer. The agent provocateurs of social media are venerated for their contrariness. The enemies are the liberals, the Democrats and their deep state cronies and the fake news media, all of which are to blame for everything from inner city crime to colluding to impeach.\n\nAnd in this reality, even American history is different. \u201cThis is a place,\u201d Trump said of the White House, \u201c1799 it was built. 1799. It started off with number six. John Adams, president.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats subpoena White House over Ukraine documents Read more\n\nIn fact the sixth president was John Quincy Adams. His father, John Adams, president No 2, was the first occupant of the White House, from 1800. Oddly, Trump made the same mistake at the same event last year.\n\nFriday\u2019s occasion was a young black leadership summit organised by the stridently pro-Trump organisation Turning Point USA. The president lavished praise on its leaders, in particular Candace Owens, a young African American woman and social media dynamo who denounces Democrats and the media as racist.\n\nTrump claimed that he spotted her star power three or four years ago. \u201cI saw this woman on television I said, \u2018Man, I don\u2019t want to mess with her. She\u2019s tough. She\u2019s tough.\u2019 Now, I\u2019m not allowed to say it, you know that.\u201d\n\nBut go on. Just this once.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to say it any more, but she\u2019s also beautiful,\u201d Trump said, arms outstretched, palms open, as the room erupted in laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Under the MeToo generation we\u2019re not allowed to say it. So all of you young brilliant guys, never, ever call a woman beautiful, please.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to do it and I\u2019ve kept doing it and I\u2019ve never been told by that woman never to do it.\u201d\n\nTrump invited Owens to take the stage and she returned the compliment with flattery that would make the Ukrainian president envious. \u201cYou know, I was thinking,\u201d she said, standing at the podium with the presidential seal, \u201cevery single president that comes into office, after two years they look so much older. He seems to be the only president that\u2019s getting younger!\u201d\n\nTrump beamed and said, \u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d The vice-president, Mike Pence, standing a short distance behind, smiled beatifically. Yet Owens wasn\u2019t done. \u201cHe has somehow found the fountain of youth. I think he gets up out of bed \u2013 it\u2019s the fight. He loves the fight, he really does. We are so blessed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Candace Owens, right, speaks at the White House on Friday. Photograph: Yuri Gripas/Reuters\n\n\u201cAnd listen, let me say this. The media. The audacity of them to think that they are going to impeach our president.\u201d\n\nThere were boos and thumbs down signs from the attendees standing under the crystal chandeliers of the east room. Shaking her head, Owens insisted: \u201cNo. It\u2019s not happening, it\u2019s absolutely not happening, not under our watch. We need to make sure we fight for this man, the one man who is standing up for black America, we are going to fight for, guys. We have to keep it going.\u201d\n\nMore cheers and applause. Trump said: \u201cOutstanding person \u2026 Do we have a choice? We have to fight, right?\u201d\n\nThe president warned that the far left \u201cwants to wreck, ruin and destroy our nation\u201d and that Democrats are on a \u201ccraven quest for money and power and other things, I guess\u201d. He encouraged the crowd to boo \u201cShifty\u201d Adam Schiff, his chief tormentor in the impeachment inquiry, claiming: \u201cHe lies like a son of a gun. He\u2019s been lying for three years.\u201d\n\n\u201cGun\u201d was a wise choice of language given the presence of Pence and others who might have objected to more profane terms.\n\nTrump \u2013 whose approval rating among black voters stands at 10% \u2013 praised himself for the lowest African American unemployment and poverty rates in history and for shepherding criminal justice reform. But that brought up a sore point and now the president went into full grievance mode.\n\nWhereas Owens had kissed the ring with peerless sycophancy, the activist and broadcaster Van Jones had betrayed him, he recalled, after pleading for his help. On his TV show about two weeks ago, Van Jones thanked everyone but Trump for criminal justice reform.\n\nHe even, Trump recalled, thanked the Rev Al Sharpton! (\u201cHe used to love me. We used to go to fights together with Don King. Don King\u2019s a friend of mine, Don King endorsed me.\u201d)\n\nSo it was the president of the United States, keeper of the world\u2019s biggest economy and deadliest nuclear arsenal, had been glued to cable news waiting for a host to give him a shout out. \u201cI kept waiting for my name \u2026 I was a little embarrassed in front of my wife. I said, \u2018He didn\u2019t name me! I\u2019m the one that did it!\u2019 I called up Jared, I said, \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019\u201d\n\nTo add insult to injury, Trump said, Van Jones told viewers: \u201cWe have to work 24 hours a day to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe president claimed that Van Jones later called his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to apologise. \u201cBut I don\u2019t accept those apologies,\u201d he said. Such slights to the Trump ego are neither forgotten nor forgiven.\n\nTrump looked around the room. \u201cShall we get back on to script?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe crowd shouted back: \u201cNo!\u201d\n\nThere seems little chance of it happening.", "description": "President revels in mutual flattery during White House event organized by pro-Trump Turning Point USA", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25e08001f8d3bea107fdb7772c1e8253dfb2522c/0_0_4767_2860/master/4767.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aedefe8c7b5366cf07a6a2c678b8291f", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
