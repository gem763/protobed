That would be a really wrong thing to do,\" Wijnaldum told Sky Sports .\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I'm sure the manager will keep us with our feet on the ground and say that we just have to think about ourselves, and try to play good and try to give 100 per cent every week.\n\n\"We just have to do what we did before and look at ourselves and not look too much to other teams because we don't have influence on other teams - we can't control the performance of other teams.\n\n\"We just have to make sure we are ready for the games that are to come and to make sure we are ready and try to have good results because we know that it can change quickly.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Then at the end of the season we will see where we stand.\"\n\nLiverpool let a seven-point lead over City slip last season and missed out on the title by a point.\n\nWijnaldum's sentiments were echoed by Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk, who was aware of the size of the challenge to displace City.\n\n\"We tried last year and unfortunately Man City was just a little bit better,\u201d van Dijk said.\n\n(Image: Offside via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cSo far we have been getting the points.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always room for improvement in our game and, what I said already before, I think we should just focus on the games ahead of us and don\u2019t look at any gaps or any points difference between us and the others, us and City.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of busy periods coming up as well, obviously with December, January.\n\n\u201cAnything can happen still.\u201d", "description": "The Liverpool midfielder has been a vital cog in his teams impressive start to the Premier League season", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images", "Offside Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20535796.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-v-RB-Salzburg-Group-E-UEFA-Champions-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
