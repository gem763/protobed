Investors can purchase shares before the 10th of October in order to be eligible for this dividend, which will be paid on the 21st of October.\n\nColonial Motor's next dividend payment will be NZ$0.4 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of NZ$0.5 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Colonial Motor stock has a trailing yield of around 5.0% on the current share price of NZ$9. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Colonial Motor\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Colonial Motor paid out 67% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out 81% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see how much of its profit Colonial Motor paid out over the last 12 months.\n\nNZSE:CMO Historical Dividend Yield, October 7th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Colonial Motor, with earnings per share up 2.7% on average over the last five years. A high payout ratio of 67% generally happens when a company can't find better uses for the cash. Combined with slim earnings growth in the past few years, Colonial Motor could be signalling that its future growth prospects are thin.\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Colonial Motor has delivered 13% dividend growth per year on average over the past ten years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nHas Colonial Motor got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share growth has been unremarkable, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear excessive. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Colonial Motor today.\n\nCurious about whether Colonial Motor has been able to consistently generate growth?
