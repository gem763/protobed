A conviction leads to removal from office.\n\nOffenses that could prompt impeachment are treason, bribery or \"other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\nThe inclusion of \"other high crimes and misdemeanors\" gives the legislative branch flexibility to investigate an array of allegations.\n\nOne article of impeachment is drafted for each alleged offense.\n\nIn the House, if a simple majority votes in favor of impeachment, the chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over a trial in the Senate. A two-thirds majority is required to convict and remove a president from office.\n\nThe Founding Fathers modeled the impeachment clause after a system in Britain which gives Parliament the authority to investigate royal advisers and other higher officials.\n\nCountries around the globe have different processes for ousting a leader, often involving courts and/or legislative bodies.\n\nUS impeachment trials:\n\nCongress has conducted two presidential impeachment trials: President Andrew Johnson in 1868, for firing a cabinet secretary without the consent of Congress, and Congress has conducted two presidential impeachment trials: President Andrew Johnson in 1868, for firing a cabinet secretary without the consent of Congress, and President Bill Clinton in 1998 for perjury and obstruction of justice.\n\nBoth Johnson and Clinton were acquitted, so they stayed in office.\n\nPresident Richard M. Nixon faced possible impeachment on the grounds of obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress in relation to the Watergate scandal. He resigned in 1974, before a vote was conducted in the House of Representatives.\n\nFebruary 21, 1868 - Johnson dismisses Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, who backed the \"Radical Republicans\" campaign for Reconstruction.\n\nFebruary 24, 1868 - The House of Representatives votes 126-47 to impeach Johnson for firing Stanton.\n\nMarch 5-May 26, 1868 - Trial in the Senate. Johnson is acquitted with a vote of 35-19, one vote shy of the two thirds majority needed to remove the president. Johnson serves out the rest of his term (until March 4, 1869), but he doesn't run for re-election. Democrats opt to nominate Horatio Seymour over Johnson during the prelude to the 1868 election.\n\n1926 - The Supreme Court strikes down the Tenure of Office Act, the basis for Johnson's impeachment.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton (1993-2001)\n\nClinton was sued in 1994 by Paula Jones for sexual harassment. Although Clinton and Jones eventually settled the suit rather than going to trial, the litigation sparked an investigation into whether Clinton obstructed justice and lied under oath. The probe centered on Clinton's relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was sued in 1994 by Paula Jones for sexual harassment. Although Clinton and Jones eventually settled the suit rather than going to trial, the litigation sparked an investigation into whether Clinton obstructed justice and lied under oath. The probe centered on Clinton's relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.\n\nThe president repeatedly denied that they had had an affair but eventually said that their relationship was inappropriate. The Clinton investigation was overseen by a special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, who was originally appointed to look into possible financial crimes involving an Arkansas land deal and a development firm called Whitewater. In 1998, after a four-year investigation, Starr produced a 445-page report detailing Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky. The report listed acts that could be grounds for impeachment.\n\nFailed measures to impeach American presidents:\n\nWhile presidential impeachments are rare in the United States, it is not unusual for members of Congress to introduce resolutions seeking to oust the commander in chief.
