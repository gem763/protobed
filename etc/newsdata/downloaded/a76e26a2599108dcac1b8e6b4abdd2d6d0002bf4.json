He lives with partner Nicola in Edenbridge, Kent.\n\nHe said: 'I had always loved racing, but I gave up and sold my car before I won the Lottery. It had been my real love from the age of 14, but I just couldn't afford it anymore.\n\n'Years later, I went back to the place I used to race, and man there said \"Out of the thousands of people who didn't make it, I always thought you would succeed.\"\n\n'That hurt \u2013 but the Lottery win helped soften the blow. It allowed me to go back to racing with UK Motorsport.\n\n'I race a \u00a360,000 Mini and it's not uneventful. I rolled a car just a few weeks ago at 80mph and it caused \u00a330,000 worth of damage. But I'm enjoying myself despite being one of the oldest in the championship, and I'm racing alongside a team of friends I've known for years. The thrill is back'.\n\nDavid Stickley: I became a model airplane enthusiast after winning \u00a321million\n\nDavid Stickley, 58, lives in Buckinghamshire with wife Donna, 48. He won \u00a321,044,592 on Lotto on 12 May 2018.\n\nHe said: 'Almost exactly a year after our win, I had a heart attack. Talk about a change in fortunes. But it was whilst in hospital, talking with two close friends who were at a model show, they shared a video of a new model plane that they said I 'needed'.\n\n'It then struck me at that moment that life really is too short so I asked them to order it straight away. I've been spending about four hours a day on my latest model plane in my workshop. I'd rather do that than sit in front of the TV.\n\n'My dad was a model aircraft enthusiast, and I flew my first plane with him at eight years old, and have been involved in the hobby ever since.\n\n'I've belonged to the same model flying club for 40+ years - I'm their third longest serving member. I own approximately 20 aircraft and 11 helicopters which are ready to fly and have bought two large models since winning the lottery.'\n\nDavid Stickley, 58, lives in Buckinghamshire with wife Donna, 48.

The joy on the faces of local children when they see him is heartwarming. For us, it's a magic which you can't see elsewhere.\n\n'We've always been crazy about Christmas, but every year now Rob dresses as Santa in his \u00a3150 suit and I don my elf costume as his helper, and we spread just a bit of happiness.\n\nElaine Leason, 59, from Driffield, East Yorkshire netted a \u00a31.4 million share of a work syndicate in July 2005 \u2013 but her best buy remains a \u00a3150 Santa suit for husband Rob, 66\n\nPeter Congdon: 'I build a pool at an MS centre in my wife's memory'\n\nPeter Congdon, 72, from Truro won \u00a313,538,113 on May 27 2015. He gave \u00a31.2 million plus a brand new Range Rover to fund a hydro pool at a local Multiple Sclerosis centre in memory of his late wife Rosemary who battled the condition for more than 30 years.\n\nHe said: 'I married Rosemary when I was 21 and she was 18, and this December we would have been celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary.\n\n'She was diagnosed with MS in her late twenties, but although she deteriorated each year, her willpower inspired me. I'd work all day, then be Rosemary's carer in the evenings and although it was exhausting, it bought us closer than ever.\n\n'She fundraised for the Merlin Centre \u2013 for people with MS \u2013 but she never lived long enough to see it finished. She died in April 2008 aged only 56, and the first thing I thought when I won the Lottery was \"I'm going to help out with the hydro pool.\"\n\n'Rosemary and I used to take collecting tins on the street to help the centre's 11-year fundraising campaign for the pool \u2013 and I know this is exactly what she would have wanted.\n\n'The pool, to help people with MS, Parkinson's and stroke sufferers, was opened this summer, and they called it Primrose, after Rosemary's favourite flower.\n\n'In the garden outside, they've planted primroses \u2013 and my wife would have loved that. I have seven cars now, and regularly I act as a chauffeur to take teenagers to the proms.\n\n'They're the children of patrons at the centre, and I only ask for a donation to be made to the Merlin Centre, where I've just been made president. It's just as Rosemary would have wanted.\n\nPeter Congdon, 72, from Truro won \u00a313,538,113 on May 27 2015 \u2013 and gave \u00a31.2 million plus a brand new Range Rover to fund a hydro pool at a local Multiple Sclerosis centre in memory of his late wife Rosemary who battled the condition for more than 30 years\n\nMichelle Edwards: 'I became a champion dog breeder'\n\nMichelle Edwards, 51, won \u00a31,925,567 on Lotto in August 2008. She lives in Exeter with husband Ed, 53, and their five dogs.\n\nShe said: 'When I was a child, the highlight of my year would be travelling from our home in Dorset with my mother to see Crufts Dog Show at London's Earls Court. I remember we\u2019d catch the bus at 4am and I\u2019d literally feel sick with excitement. When we arrived the sight of the dogs, the buzz, sound and the smell was unforgettable. I loved it \u2013 and from the age of ten, as I stood by the side of the ring, it\u2019s always been my dream to one day be there with a dog of my own.\n\n'That childhood daydream finally became a reality this year, when I walked into the ring with Maggie, my beautiful St Bernard by my side.\n\n'I was a nervous wreck, but Maggie took it all in her stride, and when the judge pointed at us, for second prize, I literally went into shock. To be honest, I\u2019m still in a daze. But it all happened because of the Lottery win.\n\n'It allowed me to own our beloved St Bernards, and have two litters from Daisy. Maggie was born 18 months ago, one of Daisy\u2019s second litter and I could see immediately that she was really special. She had really even markings and a gorgeous laid-back temperament.\n\n'To be a breeder of these beautiful dogs, and then to take Maggie to Crufts felt like a dream come true. In my spare time, I trained puppies as assistance dogs, and learned to create specialist cakes.\n\n'The Lottery has given us freedom to turn our dreams into reality'.", "description": "A stunning collection of photos showing how lottery winners have splashed their cash will be shown in a new exhibition in west London - to mark the 25th anniversary of the National Lottery.", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/08/19824200-0-image-a-5_1571295679167.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
