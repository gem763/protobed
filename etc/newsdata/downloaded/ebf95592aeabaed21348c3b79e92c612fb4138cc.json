She\u2019s not gonna be all by herself anymore. She had us at \u2026 uh \u2026 Toto. Take your pick of monumental Ren\u00e9e-isms, and get ready add her performance in Judy to the list. On Tuesday night, Toronto International Film Festival audiences gave the festival\u2019s first screening of the Ren\u00e9e Zellweger Judy Garland biopic Judy a rapturous, two-minute standing ovation. That\u2019s one minute and 40 seconds longer than the applause they gave to Joker, which they didn\u2019t even stand for, but hey, who\u2019s counting? According to a video uploaded to Twitter by Canadian journalist Tara Deschamps, the audience probably would have gone on for longer, too, if Zellweger didn\u2019t implore them to stop. (We stan a humble queen!) This comes after the film\u2019s world premiere at Telluride back in August and before its wide release on September 27.\n\nA standing ovation for JUDY. Lasted about two minutes and only ended because Renee Zellweger got teary-eyed and requested everyone sit before she messed up her makeup. #TIFF19 pic.twitter.com/DBVlFvsGEl \u2014 Tara Deschamps @ #TIFF19 (@tara_deschamps) September 11, 2019\n\nIn the video, Zellweger bows and seems grateful and says in a very Texas-y way, \u201cY\u2019all better quit! You\u2019re messing up my makeup.\u201d\n\nRenee Zellweger on Judy Garland at the #TIFF19 premiere of JUDY: \u201cI just loved her and I\u2019m sad to say I just took her for granted.\u201d pic.twitter.com/aRbAsePDb4 \u2014 Tara Deschamps @ #TIFF19 (@tara_deschamps) September 11, 2019\n\nAfter getting the audience to settle back down, Zellweger reflected on her appreciation for Garland:\n\n\u201cI just loved her, and I have to say, I took her for granted. Like a lot of people you love in your life, you know, she was just always there. And she was of course extraordinary, and of course she deserved that place in history that she carved out for herself among the greats of all time. It wasn\u2019t until we did this film that I properly came to appreciate how truly extraordinary she was [\u2026] it\u2019s not just iconic, but heroic, really.\u201d\n\nWhich is, of course, exactly how we feel about Ren\u00e9e.", "description": "Toronto International Film Festival audiences gave Ren\u00e9e Zellweger a two-minute standing ovation after the festival\u2019s first screening of the Judy Garland biopic Judy, which has Zellweger in the lead.
