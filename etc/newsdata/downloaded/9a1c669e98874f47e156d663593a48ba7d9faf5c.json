He\u2019s going to be a ladies\u2019 man.\u201d\n\nInevitably, some of the most intense discussion sparked by the new pictures revolved around junior\u2019s hair color.\n\nThe Royalist\u2019s official position is that while it is to soon to make a definitive call, early indications are that yes, the baby is strawberry blond at the very least.", "description": "The world may be going to hell in a handcart, but baby Archie Harrison made his big debut on Instagram this morning.
