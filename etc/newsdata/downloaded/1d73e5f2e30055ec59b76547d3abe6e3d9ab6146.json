It is also a cautionary tale. Sparing staff in a short downturn can allow companies to ramp up activity quickly when demand rebounds without having to hire and train new workers. But it can also slow necessary adaptations when companies are faced with structural changes, resulting in some businesses sticking to outdated business models for too long, economists and management experts say.\n\nJames Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, is among those corporate leaders considering how to give other stakeholders such as employees more clout.

In 2016, the company said it would shed 23,000 administrative and factory jobs in Germany by 2025. Hit by slower demand in China and Europe, Volkswagen slashed production in its German factories by 15% in the first half of this year and announced another 4,000 job cuts. When the restructuring is completed, Volkswagen will have shed 25% of its German workforce from its 2017 level.\n\nBut it won\u2019t resort to forced layoffs. Instead of shutting factories, Volkswagen is retooling three plants to make electric cars. And it is shrinking the workforce long term by not replacing the large numbers of baby boomers who are approaching retirement age.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think American companies should adopt polices of their German counterparts that give workers and unions more say in management decisions? Join the conversation below.\n\nBosch employs 50,000 people world-wide just in diesel components businesses, 15,000 of them in Germany. Management is negotiating with the IG Metall trade union to reach an agreement on cutting staff.\n\nBosch CEO Volkmar Denner said recently that the company is \u201cdoing everything to do this in a way that is socially responsible,\u201d saying the company would use work time accounts, severance programs, early retirement, and reducing the ranks of temporary workers.\n\nVolkmar Denner, chairman of the board of management of Robert Bosch, which is negotiating with a trade union to reach an agreement on cutting staff.

Since the 1970s, by law the supervisory board of any company with more than 2,000 employees must be made up of equal numbers of shareholder and labor representatives, which has given trade unions enormous decision-making influence.\n\nMany of Germany\u2019s biggest corporations have brokered deals with trade unions to allow them to reduce staff through various instruments in exchange for agreements to ban forced layoffs. Bayer, for example, is cutting 12,000 jobs by the end of 2021, but resorting mainly to voluntary methods such as early retirement and buyouts that in some cases offer up to five years of severance pay.\n\n\u201cSuch voluntary offers are always expensive because they have to be attractive, otherwise no one would take them,\u201d said Georg M\u00fcller, Bayer\u2019s Germany human resources chief.\n\nThe upside for Bayer, he said, that it gives the company more control over managing the staff reductions and reduces the confrontation between management and workforce, preventing costly and disruptive strikes.\n\nA Bayer pharmaceutical factory in Berlin.

Despite a 5-point drop in GDP, unemployment rose less than a percentage point, while in the U.S., it rose to a postrecession peak of 10% in October 2009 from a prerecession low of 4.4% in the spring of 2007.\n\nAnother tool that has become popular in Germany to manage capacity is working-time accounts, which are typically negotiated as part of labor contracts. With these accounts, workers can bank overtime pay during good economic times and then tap those accounts when their hours are cut during economic downturns.\n\nBut the German way also bears risks.\n\n\u201cIf you have a structural change\u2014a business model change\u2014then short-time work could prolong a crisis by avoiding making the necessary adjustments,\u201d said Enzo Weber, an economist at the Institute for Employment Research in Nuremberg, Germany.\n\nAnother limitation is that socially considerate alternatives to payroll cuts work best in deep and short downturns but can prove excessively costly\u2014to companies or to the state\u2014in shallow, protracted slumps when capacity needs to be durably reduced.\n\n\u201cThe institutions are set up to create even more flexibility\u201d to retain workers during slowdowns, said Gunther Friedl, dean of the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen School of Management in Munich. \u201cThe risk is if you keep too many people, and the losses pile up to the point of no return, that could result in bankruptcies.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s finance minister hinted last month that it had a war chest of \u20ac55 billion ($61 billion) to inject into the economy to buffer the effects of a downturn.\n\nGerman GDP shrunk in the second quarter and the country\u2019s central bank warned in its most recent monthly report that the country may already be in a recession. How long it could last is anyone\u2019s guess. There is no sign or a resolution to the global trade disputes and the slowdown in China that are weighing on global demand\u2014a particular concern for an economy that is highly dependent on exports.\n\n\u201cBusinesses should be preparing for a recession the next one to two years,\u201d Mr. Friedl said. \u201cDepending on trade fights, it could be more or less severe.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ruth Bender in Berlin contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to William Boston at william.boston@wsj.com and Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com", "description": "As corporate America debates whether companies should consider other constituencies than just their shareholders, Germany offers an example of what a new approach might look like.", "authors": ["William Boston", "Eric Morath", "William.Boston Wsj.Com", "Eric.Morath Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105186/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
