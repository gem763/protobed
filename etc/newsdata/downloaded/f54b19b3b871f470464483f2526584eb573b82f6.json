But there\u2019s a serious problem here: Comey\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s actions reflect an arrogance of power and a gross disregard for the rule of law. The work that public servants produce belongs to the public. It doesn\u2019t belong in one\u2019s study at home or on one\u2019s homebrewed server.\n\nComey, according to the Office of the Inspector General at the DOJ, brought home his memos summarizing his conversations with President Trump. He kept them in a safe at home, rather than at DOJ. When he was fired, he didn\u2019t return the memos to the FBI. Instead, he kept the memos and then shared them, through friends, with reporters.\n\nBut these memos weren\u2019t Comey\u2019s to do with as he pleased. They were, quite obviously, official FBI work product, even though Comey claimed to believe otherwise. The IG wrote that \u201cComey's characterization of the Memos as personal records finds no support in the law and is wholly incompatible with the plain language of the statutes, regulations, and policies defining Federal records, and the terms of Comey's FBI Employment Agreement.\u201d\n\nFederal records include \u201call recorded information, regardless of form or characteristics, made or received by a Federal agency ... in connection with the transaction of public business.\u201d\n\nComey wasn\u2019t meeting with Trump as an old friend or to talk real estate. Their meetings were clearly part of Comey doing his job. Some of the material was classified. \u201cAs Comey well knew, classified information is never considered personal property; rather, it is the property of the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nThis probably sounds familiar if you\u2019ve followed Comey\u2019s career, because it\u2019s the same sort of stuff that got Clinton in trouble.\n\nClinton conducted State Department business on a private secret email address based out of a server at her home. She didn\u2019t let State Department officials know about the server. When she left the department, she didn\u2019t turn over the records. Before she did turn them over, she first had her own private operatives purge the emails she thought she shouldn\u2019t have to turn over \u2014 ostensibly because they were personal, rather than federal records.\n\nThe danger of putting classified information in unsafe environments is one problem with Comey\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s actions. But there\u2019s an underlying problem even prior the questions about the classified information.\n\nPublic records belong to the public. Our federal transparency rules exist to make sure that government is by the consent of the governed. Clinton worked for us. Comey worked for us. We have a right to know how our government operates.\n\nObviously, there is some information that can\u2019t be subject to Freedom of Information requests because it is too sensitive. But there are federal authorities whose job it is to make such determinations according to the law.\n\nYes, even Comey and the Clintons are under the law.\n\nFlouting federal records rules is flouting transparency. Flouting transparency undermines democracy.\n\nNobody was surprised that Clinton would behave this way. But it's a sad irony that Comey, who saw himself as the savior of the country against the scourge of Trump, would go about his mission by trampling the rule of law and the foundation of democracy.", "description": "Flouting federal records rules is flouting transparency.
