I've missed feeling tired from running, from hard work, that feeling of being in a game again.\n\n'Everything I've been working towards is for the feeling of stepping back onto that pitch again and I'm ready to go.'\n\nLoftus-Cheek has vowed to come back 'stronger and sharper' after five-month injury lay-off\n\nIt has been a long five months for Loftus-Cheek since suffering the injury.\n\nHe added: 'When it happened I turned and pushed off and I heard a clap, it was really loud and I thought someone had smashed me from behind. The referee gave a free kick, he blew the whistle so he must have been close to me, but watching the tape back nobody was near me.\n\n'To lift my leg up took maximum effort, with a big injury it's really hard, you don't see a difference everyday, you don't wake up and think it's a lot better every morning, it's over a period of time. It's more exciting the closer I get to making my comeback, the more I keep pushing I will be there soon.\n\n'When you have a good day you get excited, getting that much closer to getting back on the pitch again playing football, getting back in the gym and pushing it, so we will see how it goes.'\n\nThe 23-year-old can be seen working out during the video as he attempts to get back to fitness\n\nWOWHYDRATE, the sugar free electrolyte water and protein water, has a unique push-cap technology which releases fresh ingredients into its water and is stocked in Tesco, Morrisons, Whole Foods and online at Amazon and Ocado.
