Well now there\u2019s a conference for you\u2014and everyone else booted from mainstream political discourse for \u201cthoughtcrimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine a conference for people banned from other conferences,\u201d the announcement for Founders Fund\u2019s exclusive new three-day event reads. \u201cImagine a safe space for people who don\u2019t feel safe in safe spaces.\u201d\n\nImagine indeed.\n\nHereticon (yes, it\u2019s actually called that) promises to include \u201cmany of our culture\u2019s most important troublemakers,\u201d specifically ones committed to improving civilization. That might rule out a few names, but we\u2019d expect Founders Fund to highlight at least a handful of thinkers from its portfolio companies.\n\nPalantir will probably show up, given recent protests and the decision by both the Grace Hopper Celebration and the Lesbians Who Tech conference to remove the company, which contracts with ICE, as a sponsor.\n\nRetiring Texas Rep. Will Hurd also seems like a natural choice, after being disinvited to keynote the Black Hat security conference due to his political record on abortion. Hurd is also friendly with Founders Fund portfolio company Anduril.\n\nUnlike gatherings of right-leaning online provocateurs that the event resembles, Hereticon will draw a more pedigreed set. The invite-only conference in May 2020 will likely attract attendees from the much-grumbled about liberal strongholds of American tech, and perhaps others who\u2019ve been cast out of the silicon gates already.\n\n\u201cFrom Galileo to Jesus Christ, heretical thinkers have been met with hostility, even death, and vindicated by posterity,\u201d the blog post grandly opens, going on to declare that \u201ctroublemakers are essential to mankind\u2019s progress, and so we must protect them.\u201d\n\nThe topics that will take center stage at Hereticon? They\u2019re a doozy. Conversations will center on a smorgasbord of libertarian micro-obsessions, including transhumanism, \u201cthe abolition of college\u201d (a favorite of Founders Fund partner Peter Thiel), \u201cthe benefits of starvation\u201d a la Jack Dorsey\u2019s fasting diet, \u201cthe softer side of doomsday prepping,\u201d and immortality, naturally.\n\nWhile it\u2019s no surprise to see such an event emerge from the crowd that sees eye-to-eye with a man seen as Silicon Valley\u2019s seastead-loving deep-pocketed free press assassin, it\u2019s interesting to see Founders Fund throw the event themselves. Some of the firm\u2019s investments, like defense-friendly Palantir and Anduril, are considered controversial in tech\u2019s left-leaning circles, but many of its portfolio companies are more quotidian utilities like Stripe, Facebook, and Credit Karma. Not exactly heretical.\n\nIt\u2019s likely a strategic choice for a venture firm that could benefit from drawing the self-identified misfits stalking tech's fringes in toward the center and giving them something to feel collectively persecuted and intellectually invigorated about.\n\nThen again, they might just come together to chatter about UFOs and wax poetic about corporate counterculture. Either way, we\u2019ll be staying tuned to see which technocrats and/or heretics get the invite nod.", "description": "The invite-only event will focus on transhumanism, the \u201cbenefits of starvation,\u201d and \u201cthe softer side of doomsday prepping,\u201d among other things.", "authors": ["Taylor Hatmaker", "Senior Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569967088/GettyImages-578544672_1_l5b6fq", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
