Photo: Getty Images\n\nIf we learned anything from Glee, it\u2019s that having more than one diva almost always results in conflict. And director Todd Phillips\u2019s Joker has two major divas, Robert De Niro and Joaquin Phoenix, who operate according to two majorly different methods, according to Phillips\u2019s memory of their time on set. His story begins before a table read for Joker, a common practice in which the cast of a movie or TV show gets together to read through an entire script before shooting begins. \u201cBob called me and he goes, \u2018Tell [Phoenix] he\u2019s an actor and he\u2019s got to be there, I like to hear the whole movie, and we\u2019re going to all get in a room and just read it,\u2019\u201d Phillips told Vanity Fair in a profile of Phoenix. \u201cAnd I\u2019m in between a rock and a hard place because Joaquin\u2019s like, \u2018There\u2019s no fucking way I\u2019m doing a read-through.\u2019\u201d Ultimately, he had to do the table read.

It\u2019s the same De Niro charm that got Joe Pesci to show up for another movie.
