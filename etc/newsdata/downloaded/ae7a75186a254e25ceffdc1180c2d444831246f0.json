Allegedly he found a reason to go forward with a complaint lodged against President Trump stemming from a conversation with Zelensky in July. The anonymous \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d as it turns out, is not, in fact, a whistleblower. The complainant is essentially a gossipmonger. The person admits no direct knowledge of the conversation. Doesn\u2019t that seem to be an important fact in this whole story?\n\nThe whistleblower didn\u2019t have direct knowledge of the communications, an official briefed on the matter told CNN. Instead, the whistleblower\u2019s concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration\u2019s determination that the complaint didn\u2019t fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said.\n\nThis anonymous person has no direct knowledge of the call and his/her \u201cconcerns\u201d come from information that was not \u201cobtained during the course of their work\u201d. Thus, this person doesn\u2019t fit the title of a whistleblower. Yet, that is still the narrative in the media. There is no whistleblower, there is only a leaker with an agenda to push. This story stinks to high heaven.\n\nWhite House and the Justice Department, according to reports, are rightfully advising the director of national intelligence that the complaint isn\u2019t covered by the laws applying to intelligence whistleblowers. So far, the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has not agreed to cooperate in releasing a transcript of the president\u2019s conversation. Maguire will testify before the House Intelligence Committee Thursday behind closed doors.\n\nPresident Trump looks to be well within his rights to have been speaking honestly to the new Ukrainian leader about corruption in Ukraine. The concern is over whether or not Trump threatened Zelensky with withholding military aid as he allegedly demanded Zelensky clean up the corruption. The $250 million has been released to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt was entirely reasonable that the United States spent a couple of months getting to know him and his administration,\u201d Lankford said, adding that he had recently visited Kyiv for the same purpose. \u201cI think we should have moved faster, but there was due diligence, and the administration has been active in trying to get lethal aid to the Ukrainians in the past.\u201d Speaking at a Defense Writers Group event Thursday, R. Clarke Cooper, assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, announced that Congress was notified late Wednesday that $141.5 million in funding was available to Ukraine. That money covers sniper rifles, grenade launchers and other items.\n\nWhy is it considered unusual for President Trump and his administration to go slow with delivering substantial military aid to Ukraine when Zelensky had only recently come into power and his allegiance to the United States was uncertain? That sounds like due diligence. But, this is 2019 and the Mueller Report blew up in the faces of Democrats frothing at the mouth for the impeachment of President Trump, so this telephone call conveniently emerged as the next best thing.\n\nConnect the dots. President Trump spoke with Zelensky the day after Mueller testified to Congress. This \u201cwhistleblower\u201d can very likely turn out to be another Trump deranged swamp creature who is disappointed that the results of the last election are still being honored and Trump is still the president. This kind of stunt, masquerading as a patriotic whistleblowing action, may backfire just like the other attempts to bring about impeachment have so far.\n\nThe president is entitled to speak with foreign leaders however he deems appropriate. If Trump felt that Zelensky needed to be pushed to do the right thing and clean up corruption in his country, then so be it. Trump\u2019s motivation looks to be protecting taxpayer money, the military aid to Ukraine, not some kind of collusion to gain support in the 2020 election. Didn\u2019t the Democrats learn anything from their humiliation after running with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign\u2019s phony Russian collusion story against Trump? Apparently not.\n\nLet them proceed. Trump should not release the phone transcript to the public. Why would any world leader speak candidly to him in future phone conversations if he does so? This is the latest attempt from Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff to satisfy the far left to continue on with attempts to impeach Trump.\n\nThis Ukraine story and the Bidens is only beginning. There will also now be some checking into the China connection with the younger Biden while his father was vice-president. Biden\u2019s son was a lobbyist, not an energy expert and the big-money contracts are highly suspect. It\u2019s all very swampy and good old Joe is right in the middle. There are many layers to this story. Most importantly, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister has already come out and denied any pressure from President Trump on that phone call.\n\nThis story all began with tantalizing headlines. This time we have him. Democrats are falling for yet another trap and I\u2019m here for it.", "description": "Swampy", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TrumpOK.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
