Very long, and very thick. The kind of lashes women covet, which is why, when his female classmates once pointed this out, he promptly cut those lashes.\n\nSemaj, 9, is no girlie-man. He's a tough kid -- \"very smart, but stubborn,\" says his mom, Aniedrea Galloway.\n\nAnd ambitious. He wants to be a rapper, a movie star or -- cue the long lashes -- a model. Pipe dreams for most, but his is a family that believes in the impossible.\n\nThree years ago, Aniedrea, a 34-year-old single mother of two, was $40,000 in debt. A full-time student at the University of the District of Columbia -- she's working toward a degree in early child development so she can open a day-care center -- Aniedrea supports the family with child support payments and the money she earns from her part-time job at a beauty salon.\n\nPaying off $40,000 under such circumstances takes resolve, which Aniedrea seems to have in abundance.\n\nResolved: To pay off her debt (now accomplished, without any assistance).\n\nResolved: To give her sons the best education possible (she drives Semaj every day from their house in Southeast Washington to Meridian Public Charter School in Northwest).\n\nResolved: To keep her cool when Semaj cops a little attitude. Which, admittedly, is not infrequent, because those beautiful eyes have in them a devilish glint.\n\nHe is, in Phase I of an interview, not much for talking. Aniedrea rolls her eyes at him, a sign of gentle exasperation, and corrects him when he uses improper English. But then Semaj is asked about the rapper Tupac, his idol, and he lights up, talking animatedly.\n\nThe curtain is lifted; the show is on.\n\nAniedrea smiles slyly and leans over the table, holding out her pen as an imitation microphone.\n\n\"And why do you like him?\"\n\n\"Because his last name is\" -- and here he pauses for dramatic effect, looking around -- \"the same as my middle name.\"\n\n\"And that name is?\"\n\nShakur, he says, and suddenly we're off on a tour of the Tupac museum that inhabits Semaj's mind. He tells us his favorite movies (documentaries about Tupac) and his favorite books (by and about Tupac) and his journal, which includes sketches of Tupac and the blueprints to a videogame Semaj would like to create about Tupac.\n\nAniedrea isn't crazy about some of the language in Tupac's work, but she admires the intensity of her son's passion, and she's grateful that it gets him researching and reading novels that typically would be daunting to a 9-year-old. It gets him writing, too. In his journal, a frayed, black-and-white marbled composition book, are rap lyrics that Semaj has written, for when he has his own spotlight.\n\nWe are impressed by Semaj's range of character, that he has morphed so quickly from aloof to engaging. So Hollywood.\n\nHe looks up, lashes almost touching his brow, eyes twinkling. \"Wanna be my agent?\"\n\nHelping KidsBefore Hollywood comes Moss Hollow, where Semaj will be a first-time camper in July.\n\nEveryone will gather for a campfire that first night, and then it's a week of hiking, swimming, canoeing, basketball, arts and crafts, and games. Oh, and a talent show. Our money's on Semaj.\n\nAs for your money, we're hoping you can spare a bit so more kids like Semaj can go to camp.\n\nOur goal by July 28: $450,000.\n\nOur total as of yesterday: $152,624.37.\n\nTo make your tax-deductible contribution: Make a check or money orderpayable to \"Send a Kid to Camp\" and mail it to P.O.
