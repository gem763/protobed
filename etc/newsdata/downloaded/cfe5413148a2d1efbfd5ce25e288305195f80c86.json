That's to be expected in times of drought, it's not the first time that's happened.\n\n\"But you've just got to keep your head in these situations. A lot of people running around at the moment getting panicked and wanting crisis measures.\n\n\"We just need to keep our heads, keep our discipline, not blow the budget.\"\n\nThe government has simplified the application process for drought assistance and is encouraging farmers in drought-affected areas to sign up.\n\nThe announcement came as Labor doubled down on criticism and called on Mr Morrison to rally a \"war cabinet\" to deal with the historic drought.\n\nThe opposition continues to criticise the government for not releasing the final report of Mr Morrison's drought coordinator-general Stephen Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter releasing its plan for helping farmers and local communities, the National Farmers' Federation criticised the Coalition for lacking a comprehensive plan.\n\n\"It's each man for himself in terms of governments,\" president Fiona Simson told ABC radio.\n\n\"The federal government certainly has an agreement about the sorts of things they're going to deliver, but we don't know what they are.\"\n\nDrought Minister David Littleproud has rejected attacks on the government, telling Coalition MPs at Parliament this week a three-pillar approach was working to assist struggling communities.\n\nMr Morrison said he and members of his Sydney church continued to pray for rain to break the drought.\n\n\"I do regularly and my church does and I know so many churches all around the country are - and good for them.\"\n\nAsked if his prayers were working, Mr Morrison said: \"We'll let's hope it is.\"\n\nLabor's agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon said families being kicked off the allowance payment would instead be given inadequate lump sums worth another six months of assistance.\n\nHe said the opposition would support the legislation, unlikely to be passed by both houses until at least next month.\n\n\"It's a callous act, in fact the greatest act of bastardry by any government in the history of the Federation, to be taking our most desperate drought-stricken farming families off the modest farm household allowance payment.\"\n\nMr Fitzgibbon said the Prime Minister had the \"political fright of his life\" in a combative radio interview on Wednesday, pushing him to announce a new payment.", "description": "New cash payments will be available once farming families reach the end of eligibility for a government support payment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2682%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_24%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f426276dde6205ac5a508034664830052502b1c8", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
