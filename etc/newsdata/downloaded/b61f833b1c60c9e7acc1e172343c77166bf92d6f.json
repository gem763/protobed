(AP) - Zemgus Girgensons scored with 7:45 left and the Buffalo Sabres continued their surprising start with a 4-3 victory over the San Jose Sharks on Saturday night.\n\nMarcus Johansson had a goal and an assist for Buffalo (7-1-1), which is coming off its sixth straight losing season.\n\nA fortuitous bounce set up Girgensons\u2019 first goal of the season. He collected the puck after Johan Larsson\u2019s shot bounced off Kyle Okposo\u2019s back and had a clear look at the net. A turnover by Sharks defenseman Erik Karlsson set up the sequence.\n\nThe Sabres are looking to end an eight-year playoff drought. They have the Eastern Conference\u2019s best record.\n\nSan Jose had a three-game winning streak snapped after opening the season with four straight losses.\n\nThe Sharks\u2018 Marcus Sorensen tied it at 3 with his second goal of the season early in the third. Brent Burns\u2019 shot bounced off Sorensen\u2019s skate and past goalie Linus Ullmark.\n\nSorensen\u2019s goal was the third between the two teams in the span of just over two minutes.\n\nIt followed Tomas Hertl\u2019s third goal of the season for San Jose, and Jeff Skinner\u2019s fifth for Buffalo.\n\nCasey Mittelstadt scored late in the second period to put Buffalo ahead 2-1. The center redirected Henri Jokiharju\u2019s shot from just inside the blue line for his fourth goal and third in two games.\n\nJohansson slipped a wrist shot past Martin Jones for the game\u2019s first goal at 12:10 of the first period.\n\nThe Sabres have scored first in eight of their first nine games.\n\nThe Sharks tied it on Timo Meier\u2019s power-play goal late in the first.\n\nUllmark, who had 29 saves, started in place of Carter Hutton, who recorded shutouts in his last two games.\n\nJones had 31 saves.\n\nNOTES\n\nSabres: Hutton is expected to start Tuesday\u2019s game against San Jose. Hutton is 5-2-1 against San Jose with a .945 save percentage and a 1.74 goals-against average. \u2026 Sharks F Noah Gregor was recalled from the San Jose Barracuda and made his NHL debut. \u2026 F Lukas Radil (illness) is day-to-day. \u2026 D Radim Simek (knee) is expected to travel with the Sharks on their five-game road trip. \u2026 It is not known if D Dalton Prout (upper body) will join San Jose on the trip.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBuffalo hosts San Jose on Tuesday night in the second game of a home-and-home set.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Zemgus Girgensons scored with 7:45 left and the Buffalo Sabres continued their surprising start with a 4-3 victory over the San Jose Sharks on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gideon Rubin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/sabres_sharks_hockey_91532_c0-125-3000-1875_s1200x700.jpg?5df86175492ddcdc04d9d2b6261257b2d49617ee", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
