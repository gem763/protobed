No matter. With a chance for an even bigger celebration ahead, Milwaukee locked in and kept on winning.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be an interesting weekend in the NL Central.\n\nOrlando Arcia doubled with the bases loaded, and the Brewers shook off the fizz from their playoffs-clinching celebration to close on the division lead Thursday, beating the Cincinnati Reds 5-3 for their seventh straight victory .\n\nThe Brewers earned at least a wild card with a 9-2 win on Wednesday night, dousing each other in the clubhouse afterward. Little more than 12 hours after the empty bottles and cans were cleared away, Milwaukee focused on an even bigger prize.\n\n\u201cWe made it so it\u2019s a big weekend in Denver,\u201d manager Craig Counsell said.\n\nMilwaukee moved within one game of the idle Cardinals for first place heading into the final weekend, the same status as a year ago when the Brewers also were a game out with three to play. They caught the Cubs and then beat them at Wrigley Field in a one-game tiebreaker for the division title.\n\nMilwaukee concludes with three games at Coors Field against the team it swept in the playoffs last year before losing to the Dodgers in the NL Championship Series. The Cardinals host the Cubs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to keep doing what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Counsell said \u201cWe need some help. It\u2019s an uphill climb with three games to go, but we\u2019ve given ourselves a chance. To get it to one game with three to play, you feel like you definitely put some heat on the Cardinals.\u201d\n\nJust like last year, the Brewers have used a sizzling September in their race toward the top. Despite losing 2018 NL MVP Christian Yelich to a broken kneecap, the Brewers have won 18 of 20 and have the best September record in the majors at 20-4. Their seven-game winning streak matches their longest this season.\n\n\u201cYeah, people don\u2019t believe it, but here we are,\u201d Arcia said through a translator .\n\nCounsell\u2019s Brewers swept the Reds for the second time this season, also taking a three-game series in April at Great American Ball Park.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always respected him and the way his teams play,\u201d Reds manager David Bell said. \u201cThey\u2019re a lot like how he was as a player. Outside of us not being in it, I\u2019m happy for them. As a fan, it\u2019s fun to watch them.\u201d\n\nThe Reds\u2019 focus was on broadcaster Marty Brennaman\u2019s final game after 46 seasons. The mayor declared Marty Brennaman Day during pregame festivities, and the 77-year-old broadcaster headed to the booth one last time before retirement.\n\nFans hoped to hear his \u201cthis one belongs to the Reds\u201d call after a victory, but not even Cincinnati\u2019s ace could make it happen. Luis Castillo (15-8) walked the bases loaded in the fourth and gave up Arcia\u2019s bases-clearing double off the glove of left fielder Josh VanMeter. Ben Gamel followed with another double for a 4-1 lead.\n\nChase Anderson (8-4) allowed Aristides Aquino\u2019s solo homer in five innings, then turned it over to a bullpen that\u2019s the team\u2019s strength. Josh Hader escaped a bases-loaded threat in the eighth and got the last four outs for his 37th save in 43 chances.\n\nWhen Alex Blandino failed to check his swing with two strikes and two outs in the ninth, Brennaman said: \u201cAnd he went around, that\u2019s a strikeout, and that\u2019s your ballgame.\u201d A few minutes later, he got choked up several times and had to pause to collect himself during his final radio sign-off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m a Cincinnatian,\u201d Brennaman said. \u201cAnd for those who are listening wherever they might be, just know how much you\u2019re loved \u2026 (long pause) \u2026 and how much you\u2019re appreciated. That\u2019s all I got.\u201d\n\nFAST COMPANY\n\nBrennaman is one of eight major league broadcasters who covered one team for at least 46 seasons, joining the Dodgers\u2019 Vin Scully (67), the Mets\u2019 Ralph Kiner (52), the Royals\u2019 Denny Matthews (51), the Brewers\u2019 Bob Uecker (49), the Cardinals\u2019 Jack Buck and Mike Shannon (48), and the Dodgers\u2019 Jaime Jarrin (47).\n\nLOTTA HOMERS\n\nAquino\u2019s homer was the Reds\u2019 223rd of the season, setting a club record. They hit 222 in 2005.\n\nATTENDANCE BUMP\n\nBrennaman\u2019s final game drew 27,774 fans and boosted Cincinnati\u2019s home attendance to 1,775,396, a slight increase over last season. The Reds drew 1,629,356 last year, their lowest since 1984.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBrewers: Eric Thames felt hamstring discomfort after running out a grounder in the second inning and left the game as a precaution.\n\nReds: Eugenio Su\u00e1rez got a day out of the lineup after hitting his 49th homer Wednesday night. He pinch hit in the eighth and was walked intentionally.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrewers: Head to Colorado with Zach Davies (10-7) facing Antonio Senzalela (10-11) in the opener.\n\nReds: Head to Pittsburgh, where they\u2019ve dropped 10 straight. Anthony DeSclafani (9-9) faces left-hander Steven Brault (4-6).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The carpeting in the Brewers' clubhouse was still damp from all the bubbly and beer sprayed around the place only a dozen hours earlier.
