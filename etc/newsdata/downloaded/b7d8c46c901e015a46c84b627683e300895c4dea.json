Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), the second-highest-ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, will become the panel\u2019s acting chair following the passing of Rep. Eljiah E. Cummings (D-Md.), according to a senior Democratic leadership aide.\n\nAD\n\nThe process to elect a permanent chair of the committee will be announced at a later time, the aide said. The succession process will be handled by the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, with the results later ratified by full House Democratic Caucus.\n\nBesides Maloney, other contenders could include Reps.

None have formally announced an intention to run.\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Mike DeBonis\n\n9:40 a.m.: Sondland tells impeachment investigators Trump urged him to work with Giuliani on Ukraine\n\nIn his opening statement, Sondland told impeachment investigators that Trump urged him to work with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani on matters related to Ukraine, including a possible visit by its new president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nSondland said Trump was skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption efforts, according to a written copy of his statement.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe directed those of us present at the meeting to talk to Mr. Giuliani, his personal attorney, about his concerns,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cIt was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSondland said he did not understand \u201cuntil much later that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign.\u201d\n\nSondland said that he and others were \u201cdisappointed by the President\u2019s direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the President\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nSondland said he also \u201cstrongly believed\u201d that a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky should have been scheduled \u201cwithout any preconditions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n9:10 a.m.: Sondland arrives at the Capitol\n\nSondland has arrived at the Capitol for his scheduled 9:30 a.m. deposition before three House panels.\n\n9 a.m.: Trump offers \u2018warmest condolences\u2019 to family of Cummings\n\nTrump tweeted his condolences Thursday morning over the death of Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which is involved in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cMy warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring the summer, Trump repeatedly lashed out at Cummings and the city he represents, saying at various points that residents of Baltimore were living in a \u201crodent infested mess\u201d and that Cummings was to blame because he had a \u201cvery iron hand\u201d on it.\n\nTwenty minutes after praising Cummings for his work, Trump returned to lashing out at the impeachment inquiry on Thursday, writing on Twitter: \u201cThe Greatest Witch Hunt in American History!\u201d\n\n8:30 a.m.: Republicans postpone news conference on impeachment inquiry following death of Cummings\n\nA group of House Republicans postponed a news conference scheduled for Thursday morning at which they planned to demand greater \u201ctransparency and inclusion\u201d in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nA statement released by the office of Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said the decision was made following the death of Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, one of the panels involved in the inquiry.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe anticipate the conference may be rescheduled for the near future and will be working on those details, but out of respect for Representative Cummings it will not take place today,\u201d the statement said.\n\nGaetz\u2019s office said more than 30 House Republicans had planned to attend, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).\n\n8 a.m.: Sondland scheduled for 9:30 a.m. deposition behind closed doors\n\nHouse investigators expect to hear testimony Thursday from Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a central figure in the impeachment inquiry. He is scheduled to appear behind closed doors at 9:30 a.m.\n\nAD\n\nSondland, a hotel developer and major Trump fundraiser who had no background in diplomacy before he was confirmed by the Senate in June 2018, was pivotal to the administration\u2019s efforts to pressure the government of Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals, according to text messages and testimony from current and former officials.\n\nAD\n\nHe plans to say that a text message he sent Sept. 9 to the senior U.S. diplomat in Kyiv denying any quid pro quo with Ukraine, which was desperate for U.S. military aid and diplomatic support, was relayed to him directly by Trump, according to a person familiar with his testimony who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public.\n\n7:45 a.m.: Trump heading to Texas for another campaign rally\n\nTrump plans to head to Dallas on Thursday for a \u201cKeep America Great Rally.\u201d In recent weeks, he has used such events to air grievances about the impeachment process and the Democrats who are leading it.\n\nTrump is scheduled to depart the White House at 10:30 a.m. and has several other events scheduled in Texas before he plans to stage his reelection rally around 7 p.m. Central time.\n\nThe rally comes a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other top Democrats walked out of a meeting with Trump at the White House after Trump disparaged Pelosi. It was the first time they had come face-to-face since Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nIn remarks outside the White House, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters that Trump had called Pelosi a \u201cthird-rate politician.\u201d Pelosi later clarified at the Capitol that Trump had called her a \u201cthird-grade politician.\u201d\n\n7:30 a.m.: Trump urges support for resolution censuring Schiff\n\nPresident Trump is urging House members to support a Republican resolution to censure Schiff for his handling of the impeachment inquiry. Democrats are expected to block the resolution Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cHope all House Republicans, and honest House Democrats, will vote to CENSURE Rep. Adam Schiff tomorrow for his brazen and unlawful act of fabricating (making up) a totally phony conversation with the Ukraine President and U.S. President, me. Most have never seen such a thing!\u201d Trump tweeted late Wednesday night.\n\nThe resolution, introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), takes issue with Schiff\u2019s remarks at a Sept. 26 hearing. Schiff embellished the transcript of the July phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.\n\nSchiff later said his remarks were intended as parody and that Trump and others who have criticized him should have recognized that.\n\nThe resolution contends that Schiff \u201cmanufactured a false retelling of the conversation.\u201d\n\nIt also takes aim at Schiff for other actions, including some related to the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cMembers of the Intelligence Committee have lost faith in his objectivity and capabilities as Chairman, with every Republican member on the Committee having signed a letter calling for his immediate resignation as Chairman,\u201d the resolution says.\n\nHouse Democrats are expected to vote to \u201ctable\u201d the resolution as early as Thursday. That would prevent a vote on the resolution itself.\n\n7:20 a.m.: Trump shares tweets by McConnell critical of the impeachment process\n\nTrump took to Twitter early Thursday to share tweets from McConnell that were critical of the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nIf Trump is impeached by the Democratic-led House, the Republican-led Senate would hold a trial on whether to remove him from office.\n\n\u201cWashington Democrats have been engaged in a three-year-long impeachment parade in search of a rationale,\u201d McConnell wrote in one tweet. \u201cProminent House Democrats were promising impeachment at the very beginning of this presidency. Fairness and due process are not their objectives here.\u201d\n\nIn another, McConnell said that the \u201cDemocrats\u2019 impeachment obsession is blocking urgent work for American families,\u201d including passage of a trade deal to replace NAFTA.\n\nOn Wednesday, McConnell told Senate Republicans he expects that the House will vote to impeach Trump and that the Senate trial will probably begin around Thanksgiving.\n\n7:10 a.m.: Trump tried to insult \u2018unhinged\u2019 Pelosi with an image. She made it her Twitter cover photo.\n\nThe image was meant to be an insult \u2014 \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d Trump wrote as a caption. But instead, it ended up as Pelosi\u2019s Twitter cover photo.\n\nThe photo is striking: Pelosi, in electric blue, the only woman visible at the table, standing across from a homogeneous row of men, pointing her finger at the president.\n\nTo Democrats, what the photo conveyed was clear: the speaker \u201cliterally standing up to the president\u201d after the House overwhelmingly voted to condemn his decision to pull out of northern Syria. The remarkable moment marked the latest episode in the long-running theatrical feud between Pelosi and Trump, ending, like others, with the Democratic leader reclaiming the president\u2019s insult as a badge of pride.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Meagan Flynn\n\n7 a.m.: Donald Trump Jr. slammed for attacking Hunter Biden over nepotism\n\nDonald Trump Jr. listened Wednesday night as Fox News host Sean Hannity scrutinized Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings, suggesting that the son of a former vice president only had opportunities in other countries because \u201cthey\u2019re really buying favor with the father.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course they are,\u201d Trump Jr. chimed in. \u201cWhen you\u2019re the father and your son\u2019s entire career is dependent on that, they own you.\u201d\n\nTrump Jr.\u2019s Wednesday remarks sparked collective head-scratching and ridicule, but it\u2019s a critique that he and his brother Eric Trump have repeatedly voiced in recent days \u2014 much to the increasing annoyance of critics, including Comedy Central host Trevor Noah, who are vexed by the pair\u2019s apparent lack of self-awareness.\n\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s be clear, I\u2019m not defending Hunter Biden,\u201d Noah said on his show Wednesday. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is the last people who should be talking about the blurred lines of family names and political influence are the people currently running their home office from the White House.\u201d\n\nRead more here.", "description": "House impeachment investigators are hearing from the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.
