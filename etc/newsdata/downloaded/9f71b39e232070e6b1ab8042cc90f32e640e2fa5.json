They had a bye last week.\n\nWith Green Bay having just taken a 14-10 lead, the Raiders offense got into scoring position on a 48-yard catch by tight end Darren Waller to the Packers three yard line.\n\nBut Oakland quarterback Derek Carr fumbled the ball on the goal line and it bounced out of the end zone, resulting in a turnover and touchback for the Packers.\n\nGreen Bay took advantage with a touchdown and potential 14-point swing on Rodgers\u2019 long touchdown pass to Kumerow and run down the sideline with 12 seconds left in the half.\n\nThe Packers got the ball back to start the second half. On the first play from scrimmage, Rodgers connected with Valdes-Scantling for a gain of 59 yards. That set the stage for Rodgers to ramble into the end zone for his running touchdown.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Mud Bowl\u2019-\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys won a battle for first place in the NFC East division, thumping the Philadelphia Eagles 37-10 to halt a three-game skid.\n\n\u201cWe started fast and we finished strong,\u201d said Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott, whose Cowboys seized a quick 14-0 lead and powered on to the win.\n\nThe Cowboys had opened the season with three straight wins but dropped three straight to go into the game tied with the Eagles at 3-3.\n\nPrescott connected on 21-of-27 passes for 239 yards, one touchdown and an interception and rushed for a touchdown. Running back Ezekiel Elliott rushed for 111 yards and a touchdown and the Cowboys defense forced four turnovers.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams got a much-needed win as well, downing the Atlanta Falcons 37-10 to stay in touch in the NFC West led by the unbeaten San Francisco 49ers.\n\nTodd Gurley caught a touchdown pass in his return and the Rams defense was stellar against the Falcons, whose Matt Ryan became the league\u2019s latest quarterback casualty when he was knocked out of the game with a right ankle injury in the fourth quarter when he was sacked by Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald.\n\nThe 49ers improved to 6-0 thanks to three field goals from Robbie Gould in a 9-0 victory over the Redskins in Washington, where heavy rain and wind made for treacherous field conditions.\n\nThe 49ers are 6-0 for the first time since 1990.\n\n\u201cMud Bowl 2019 champions,\u201d 49ers defender Richard Sherman said after a game that saw players slipping and sliding on the soaked field \u2014 and some San Francisco players celebrating the win with belly-slides through the puddles. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u201d", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Aaron Rodgers delivered a masterful performance, throwing five touchdowns and running for another as the Green Bay Packers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/32215d_aaron-rodgers-green-bay-packers-calls-play-in-oakland-raiders-lambeau-field-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
