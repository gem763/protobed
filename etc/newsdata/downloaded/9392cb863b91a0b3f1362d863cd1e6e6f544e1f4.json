When she tried to get a meal in July, she found the only option available to her was a plate of French fries and some salad.\n\nThe 43-year-old from the Socialists and Democrats group is trying to shake the Parliament from the inside and make the vegan food option available for its employees and visitors. On September 18, she sent a letter to the Parliament's Secretary-General Klaus Welle, in which she asks about the food policy of the Parliament and how the tenders for catering are carried out.\n\n\u201cThe majority of food offered in the canteens in the EU is the food based on \u2026 meat-originated products. It\u2019s meat, milk products, eggs. As a vegan, I can clearly see the lack of vegan products,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nThe letter stresses that \u201cvegans working in the European Parliament or visiting it most often are unable to provide themselves with a nutritious meal during their work or visit.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaxpayers don\u2019t pay me to go around the city to vegan restaurants\" \u2014 MEP Sylwia Spurek\n\nSpurek added that in Brussels she can sometimes go out to nearby restaurants. In Strasbourg, leaving the Parliament premises and searching for a vegan restaurant in the city center would take her more than an hour and a half.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers don\u2019t pay me to go around the city to vegan restaurants. Taxpayers pay me to work efficiently \u2014 that\u2019s why the food available on the premises of the Parliament should be the food adjusted to different diets and dietary requirements, in a way that every member of Parliament has the same access to food,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore she came to Brussels as an MEP this year, Spurek, a lawyer, was Poland's deputy ombudswoman. She entered politics in March and ran her campaign making pledges about human rights, environmental protection and animal welfare.\n\nShe said the European Parliament should be \u201ccrystal-clear\u201d and practice what it preaches. \u201cWe talk about how the \u2018animal-based\u2019 [food] production causes the climate disaster, and at the same time in restaurants and bars in the European Parliament we offer almost only the animal-originated products. There\u2019s a lack of consistency between the values declared by us, by the EU, and what we do,\u201d she said.\n\nA Parliament spokesperson said that Spurek's questions will be \"duly answered\" but they also stressed that catering services have improved significantly in recent years and ensure \"incorporation of sustainability, ecology and fair-trade aspects in the daily catering offers.\"\n\n\"A special attention goes to the presence of fruit, vegetables and legumes ... in buffet to compose a personal portion,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Tuesday, EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan said he did not imagine the bloc would advise Europeans to eat less meat in order to combat climate change.\n\nHogan, nominated to be the EU\u2019s next trade chief, said: \u201cI don\u2019t imagine a recommendation at EU level in that sense.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after a meeting of EU agriculture ministers in Finland, he replied to a journalist\u2019s question about a report by the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which pointed at agriculture as a major driver of climate change by defending the health benefits of eating meat.\n\nAfter raising the issue of the lack of vegan food on social media, Spurek was flooded by a wave of negative comments claiming that lack of vegan food is not a big deal.\n\n\u201cI did not see that in the report that they were advocating that people should eat less meat because the regular communications from the World Health Organization is \u2026 to use a balanced diet.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you know if you continue to eat red meat every day for every particular meal, like you would if you actually eat for maybe three meals a day fish, or [if you] eat fruit and vegetables from Spain for every meal three times a day, of course it\u2019s going to have some implications in relation to your health, sometimes not so good.\u201d\n\nChuckling and clutching his stomach, Hogan said: \u201cYou can see that I have a balanced diet, it sometimes inbalances me.\u201d\n\nAfter raising the issue of the lack of vegan food on social media, Spurek was flooded by a wave of negative comments claiming that lack of vegan food is not a big deal. One commentator called her \"fanatical.\" She\u2019s not surprised by this reaction. \u201cFor a long time, I\u2019ve been raising the issues that are controversial for many people \u2026 I\u2019ve never come across such controversies when I said that I\u2019m a feminist, as I\u2019ve come across when I say that I\u2019m vegan,\u201d she said.\n\nEddy Wax contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
