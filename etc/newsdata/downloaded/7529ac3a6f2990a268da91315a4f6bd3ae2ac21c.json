The UNC\u2019s deputy commander, Vice Admiral Stuart Mayer of the Royal Australian Navy, and Chung Suk-hwan, Seoul\u2019s deputy defense minister for national defense policy, are to conduct the high-level talks, according to ministry sources.A day earlier, in a parliamentary audit session at the National Assembly, Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul admitted the need for \u201clegal improvements\u201d to the UNC\u2019s jurisdiction over entry into the DMZ as stipulated under the terms of the armistice agreement that ended hostilities in the 1950-53 Korean War.The comment came as a response to Rep. Chun Jung-bae, who said the lack of recourse for Seoul in the event that the UNC forbids DMZ entry \u201ccompletely violates the principles of the rule of law and democracy,\u201d and stressed the necessity of an institutional supplement to allow for non-military usage of the DMZ.\u201cIf you look at the armistice agreement, [the UNC\u2019s] control over entry into the DMZ is limited to matters of a military nature,\u201d Kim answered. \u201cThere have been issues raised about the legality of entry control over non-military matters, like environmental inspections, research into historical artifacts or visits to guard posts.\u201dKim also acknowledged there had been \u201cdifferences in opinion\u201d between the government and the UNC about entry control over the DMZ and the military demarcation line - the formal border separating the two Koreas - but that the two sides were in close talks to alleviate these disagreements.The remarks stood out as a rare disclosure from a high-ranking official in Seoul about a major component of the armistice agreement linked to Seoul\u2019s sovereignty over its own territory.The UNC, while a multinational command structure, is commanded by the head of the United States Forces Korea, and is effectively regarded as a U.S.-led organ.Under Seoul\u2019s Moon Jae-in administration, which has actively pursued peace-building efforts on the Korean Peninsula, the DMZ has emerged as a significant pressure point in the South Korea-U.S. alliance, particularly as Seoul and Washington diverged in regards to exchanges with North Korea.Last August, South Korea requested to send a train through the DMZ as part of a project to inspect and ultimately modernize the North\u2019s railways, but the UNC rejected the proposal, citing there wasn\u2019t enough time to review the request. In January this year, the UNC derailed the South Korean government\u2019s plans to send humanitarian aid in the form of Tamiflu, an influenza medicine, because the trucks that would be used to transport the drugs were banned by U.S. economic sanctions on the North.Separately, South Korea also needed to obtain the UNC\u2019s approval to build three so-called peace trails in border towns of the DMZ, an initiative that was meant to encourage inter-Korean civilian exchanges toward an eventual transformation of the zone into a peace park. Those permits were granted, but questions continue to loom about Seoul\u2019s autonomy to pursue non-military policies related to the DMZ without backing from Washington.On the controversy, a Unification Ministry official told reporters on Tuesday that Seoul would work to \u201cinstitutionalize\u201d future DMZ entry issues with the UNC, by improving relevant regulations and manuals, so as to alleviate issues related to non-military initiatives - within the framework of the armistice agreement. A component of this process, the official said, would be to create a guideline to gauge whether a project could be classified as military or non-military.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK, JEONG YONG-SOO [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
