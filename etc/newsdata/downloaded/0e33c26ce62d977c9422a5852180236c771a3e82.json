The Conservatives fiercely opposed them, as did some small business owners and organizations that advocate on their behalf, such as the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.\n\nCritics said the Liberals were attacking small businesses \u2014 collectively the biggest source of employment in Canada \u2014 and making it tougher for them to grow and save.\n\nThe Liberals, however, argued they were cracking down on well-off Canadians using the advantageous tax structure of private corporations to shield income from taxation.\n\nTrudeau's campaign says that rolling back the measures would amount to a \"tax cut\" for the wealthiest Canadians. While it's true that high-income earners undoubtedly would benefit from the Tory proposals, the reality is not so simple.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nTo sprinkle, or not to sprinkle?\n\nIncome sprinkling is a tax strategy that diverts income to family members with lower personal tax rates. It allows a small business owner to avoid having their income taxed at a higher rate by splitting it up among family members who own shares in the corporation.\n\nBefore the changes made by the Trudeau government, income could be divided among family members who had no discernible role in a particular business. The Liberals imposed stringent conditions on how and why income could be split up within a family.\n\nAt the time the measures were floated, the government estimated they would affect about 45,000 private corporations across the country, or about 3 per cent of all small businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, a March 2018 analysis by the Parliamentary Budget Officer looked at what types of families would be affected, based on their total annual taxable income.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said that Liberal changes to income sprinkling disregard the notion that family members often contribute to small businesses in subtle ways. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe report found that 26 per cent of families affected by the changes earned total taxable income of between $150,000 and $250,000 each year, while 46 per cent earned between $250,000 and $500,000 annually. A further 15 per cent of affected families brought in between $500,000 and $1 million in taxable income each year.\n\nThe PBO also noted that about 900 Canadian families making less than $100,000 annually would end up paying more income tax as a result of the Liberal government's tax changes.\n\nTammy Schirle, a professor of economics at Wilfrid Laurier University, said that Canadians who gained the most from income sprinkling tended to be in the top 10 per cent of income earners.\n\n\"So those are people who are definitely pretty well-off,\" she said.\n\nThere are scenarios which could see a family avoid upwards of $50,000 in income tax in any given year if the Liberal measures were rolled back. Whether those people actually qualify as \"multi-millionaires\" \u2014 as the Liberals imply in their messaging \u2014 depends on their individual circumstances.\n\nLimiting passive income\n\nIn addition to re-introducing income sprinkling for some small business owners, the Conservatives also have said they would \"repeal Trudeau's tax on small business investments.\"\n\nThis is where passive investments and passive income come into play.\n\nPassive income is generated from interest earned on passive investments, which tend to be in stocks or bonds rather than, say, new equipment or land for a new factory that a small business might purchase.\n\nThe Liberals' changes mean that after a business starts earning more than $50,000 in passive income, a larger share of its regular income is subject to the general corporate tax rate of 15 per cent, rather than the more favourable small business tax rate of nine per cent.\n\nA business would need $1 million in passive investments, earning at a modest 5 per cent rate of return, to reach that $50,000 threshold where the higher corporate rate kicks in.\n\nThe Department of Finance estimates that, as of 2015, only about 2.9 per cent of Canadian small businesses \u2014 about 50,000 of them \u2014 met that threshold. In fact, more than 80 per cent of small businesses in 2015 did not have any passive investments at all.\n\nIt should be noted that opponents of the Liberal measures have argued that the $50,000 passive income threshold was too low.\n\nAfter all, $1 million in savings might not do much to help a business salt away money for a large capital purchase or plan for a rainy day.\n\nTaken together, bringing back income sprinkling (as it existed before) and eliminating passive investment fairness measures would leave some small business owners paying considerably less in tax.\n\nAre they all millionaires? Some absolutely would be, while others would not.\n\nIs it an across the board \"tax cut\" of $50,000, as Trudeau puts it? No \u2014 but it would mean some multi-millionaire small business owners avoiding taxes in ways not available to most other Canadians.\n\nVerdict: It's complicated.\n\nSources: It's time for Canada's small business owners to get ahead, Conservative Party of Canada; Archived - Backgrounder: Income Sprinkling Using Private Corporations, Department of Finance Canada; Backgrounder: Tax Fairness for the Middle Class and Opportunity for All Canadians, Department of Finance Canada; A week of tax promises that are more about politics than policy, CBC News; Key Small Business Statistics - January 2019, Government of Canada; Budget 2018, Government of Canada; Income Sprinkling Using Private Corporations, Parliamentary Budget Officer", "description": "Wealthy owners of private corporations would surely benefit from some of the Conservatives' tax proposals.
