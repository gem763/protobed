He includes several categories of people such as \u201cthe reactionary Muslims, the Trotsky-Stalinists, the cowards, the followers of secularism, the informers of Islamophobia\u201d, as part of the collabos.\n\nCharlie Hebdo Gets Fresh Death Threats over Tariq Ramadan Cartoon https://t.co/N1VxhQIQQp \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 7, 2017\n\nHe also described the direct aftermath of the shooting as he saw the body of one of the victims saying: \u201cHe was a 25-year-old friend. To reach the exit, I had no alternative but to step over him. Assisted by the fireman, I resolved to this gesture that made me ashamed. I ask you a thousand times for forgiveness, my friend, but I could not do otherwise.\u201d\n\nIn a prior interview with French magazine Le Point, Riss expressed little hope that anything has changed since 2015, saying: \u201cIf we republished the cartoons today, we would be alone again, the attack did not make people more courageous, on the contrary.\u201d\n\nDespite the attack, Charlie Hebdo has continued to satirise and lampoon anyone and everyone on the political scene in France and has received backlash several times, including death threats over a cover involving Muslim scholar Tariq Ramadan in 2017.\n\nWhile the magazine does still take risks on its content, former Charlie Hebdo journalist Zineb El Rhazoui said in 2017 that the magazine had lost its edge and \u201cgone soft\u201d.\n\n\u2018English Multiculturalism Has Lost Its Head\u2019: Charlie Hebdo Satirises Britain\u2019s Response to Terror https://t.co/mpdmPivwzC \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 8, 2017", "description": "The head of French magazine Charlie Hebdo blasted leftists and others in a new book about the 2015 Islamic extremist terror attack.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/Charlie-Hebdo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
