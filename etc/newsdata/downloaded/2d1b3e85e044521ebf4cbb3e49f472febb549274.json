Of those, tens of thousands have been suspended for a variety of reasons while we continue to investigate\".\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe suspected apps were associated with about 400 developers, and many of the software programs were still in testing phases, according to Facebook.\n\nThe huge social network became the subject of intense scrutiny after acknowledging in 2018 that Cambridge Analytica misappropriated personal data on tens of millions of Facebook users as part of its work for US President Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nSubsequently, Facebook said it would review all apps on the platform to determine how they used data and if they respect its privacy rules.\n\n\"In a few cases, we have banned apps completely,\" Mr Archibong said.\n\nBans can be caused by violations including inappropriately sharing data obtained from Facebook or making data publicly available without protecting people's identities, according to the social network.\n\nAPP CRACKDOWN\n\nA year ago, Facebook said it had banned some 400 apps including one called myPersonality, which according to Mr Archibong \"shared information with researchers and companies with only limited protections in place\", and refused to accept an audit.\n\nFacebook said a recent agreement on privacy with the US Federal Trade Commission - which included a record US$5 billion fine - calls for additional oversight on app developers.\n\nIt \"requires developers to annually certify compliance with our policies\", Mr Archibong said. \"Any developer that doesn't go along with these requirements will be held accountable.\"\n\nFacebook earlier this year filed a lawsuit against South Korean data analytics firm Rankwave in California to make sure it isn't breaking the leading social network's rules.\n\nREVAMPING CONTROLS\n\nAlong with slapping Facebook with a record fine for data protection violations, the settlement in July called for Facebook to create a privacy committee within its board of directors to be appointed by an independent nominating committee.\n\nThis would end \"unfettered control\" of decisions on privacy by Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, the FTC statement said.\n\nFacebook also will be required to conduct privacy reviews of every new or modified product, service or practice before it is implemented, including for its WhatsApp and Instagram services.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to protect people's privacy,\" Mr Zuckerberg said at the time.\n\n\"We're going to set a completely new standard for our industry.\"\n\nAs the news was announced by Facebook, Mr Zuckerberg was in Washington meeting with policymakers on questions about privacy and antitrust issues, and held talks at the White House with Mr Trump.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Technology - [SAN FRANCISCO] Facebook said on Friday that it suspended \"tens of thousands\" of apps on its platform as a result of a privacy practices review launched following a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica. .
