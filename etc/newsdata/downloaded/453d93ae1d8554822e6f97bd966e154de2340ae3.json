That for me is an important problem because it says we are not working on things that will positively affect our collective future,\" he said.\n\n\"These startups are all great and we're fans of entrepreneurship, but we're most especially bigger fans of deep tech of startups.\"\n\nSpeaking at D61+ Live this week, Leonard believes investors currently shy away from deep tech investments because it's high in risk and the returns are not immediate.\n\n\"Investors always chase highest returns that have the shortest amount of time to realise a return with the lowest amount of risks, and none of those characteristics relate to deep tech,\" he said.\n\n\"Deep tech is a general statement; not only is there an executional risk but you also have technology risks \u2026 for us investors it's not a surprise, but we're trying to think of ways to attract other support into the ecosystem \u2013 investment support and corporate support.\"\n\nFunded by Singapore's Ministry of Finance, SGInnovate has backed more than 70 local and foreign startups, which is equivalent to approximately SG$40 million, since it was established in November 2016.\n\nSome companies that have received backing from SGInnovate include Taiger, AIDA technologies, and Melbourne-based See-Mode.\n\nLeonard said the investments made by the company have been based on market-led trends and knowing that tangible use cases can be delivered, but it also avoided unicorns.\n\n\"We're not searching for unicorns; they're not good outcomes to pursue because we think they take us off the important work,\" he said.\n\n\"What we're interested in is are they gaining adoption by the end user? Are hospitals using this technology? Are industrial automation firms thinking about this technology? Are investors wanting to be part of this next round? -- that's what we pay attention to.\"\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nNZ government hands out an extra NZ$9m to support 'deep tech' incubators\n\nThe amount is on top of the existing NZ$25.5 million that was allocated under the 2019 Budget to the New Zealand Technology Incubator program.\n\nResearchers find crowdsourcing, AI go together in battle vs. lung cancer\n\nCrowd innovation can be used for algorithms and artificial intelligence to offset a shortage of radiation oncologists for lung cancer, say researchers.\n\nSingapore 'deep tech' startups face funding hurdle as risks higher\n\nBecause investment risks typically are higher and returns slower with startups that deal with deep technology such as artificial intelligence and medtech, venture capitalists in Singapore are less willing to stick their bets in early-stage startups.\n\nHow to differentiate between AI, machine learning, and deep learning (TechRepublic)\n\nTech leaders need to put AI and its subcategories into practice-and into common business vocabulary that everyone can understand.", "description": "Singapore's government-owned venture firm wants Australian investors to join its cause and grow the deep tech space.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/27/3bf20bef-00fe-436c-99e8-cb7384ca61bc/thumbnail/770x578/f6f6a05d5ae5342d360253098c903af6/istock-1051617224.jpg"}
