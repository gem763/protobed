The theme? Arabian Nights.\n\nAnd on Thursday, another bombshell dropped on the prime minister, who is leader of the Liberal Party.\n\nGlobal News obtained video that shows Trudeau covered in what appears to be \u201cdark makeup and raising his hands in the air while laughing, sticking his tongue out and making faces\u201d.\n\nTrudeau was quick to apologise. This time it wasn\u2019t for some 19th century wrongdoing, it was for himself.\n\n\u201cIn 2001, when I was a teacher in Vancouver, I attended a gala. The theme was Arabian Nights. I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put make-up on. I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I should have known better, but I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m really sorry,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cI take responsibility for my decision to do that. I shouldn\u2019t have done it. I should have known better. It was something that I didn\u2019t think was racist at the time, but now I recognise it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.\u201d\n\nThe timing couldn\u2019t be worse for the prime minister, whose right-on reputation has begun unravelling over the past year in a minefield of scandal and political missteps.\n\nHis Liberal Party is fighting for its life in a general election on 21 October as many Canadians have tired of long-winded bromides with a cup of sanctimony thrown in.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

As will most of his fangirls and boys.\n\n\u201cMost of the things you ever did that sound appalling now were appalling then, and you deserve to have a terrible time living with them,\u201d Wells wrote.\n\n\u201cBut also that people change. People grow. Justin Trudeau\u2019s career has been based on claiming that simple fact for himself and denying it to his opponents. Will that stop now? Of course not. It\u2019s how he\u2019s wired.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2015 election, the Conservatives claimed Trudeau \u201cjust wasn\u2019t ready\u201d. He was \u201ccallow\u201d and wasn\u2019t a serious person. That is becoming increasingly obvious.\n\nToronto Sun columnist Warren Kinsella \u2013 a one-time Liberal strategist and longtime anti-racism activist \u2013 asked aloud whether Trudeau is a racist.\n\n\u201cWhen asked about Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that four Democratic politicians \u2018go back to the \u2018crime infested places\u2019 they came from, Justin Trudeau refused to say Trump\u2019s racist statements were, in fact, racist,\u201d Kinsella wrote.\n\n\u201cSaid Trudeau: \u2018Canadians and indeed people around the world know exactly what I think about those particular comments\u2019.\n\n\u201cAfter Canadians have looked at that shocking photo of the Liberal prime minister mocking and denigrating black people \u2013 after the embarrassment and shame he has now brought on Canada internationally \u2013 it\u2019s hard to know exactly what Justin Trudeau was thinking. Or if he thinks at all.\u201d\n\nKinsella added: \u201cAt the end of this shocking revelation, we are left with one thought: this is not the face of a prime minister.\u201d\n\nBut in the end, the shocking revelations may not make a difference.\n\nCanadians have been reminded that once again, politicians are hypocrites.\n\nThe blackface/brownface was shocking.
