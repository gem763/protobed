Park officials said they would provide regular updates.\n\nSince the 1950s, dozens of people have died on Uluru due to accidents, dehydration and other heat-related events. In 2018, a Japanese tourist died while attempting to ascend one of the steepest parts of the rock.\n\nUluru is 348m (1,142ft) high, and the climb is steep and can be slippery. Temperatures in the area can also reach 47C (116F) in the summer.\n\nIn 2017, the board of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park voted unanimously to end the climb because of the spiritual significance of the site, as well as safety and environmental reasons.\n\nOne Anangu man told the BBC that Uluru was a \"very sacred place, [it's] like our church\".\n\n\"People right around the world... they just come and climb it. They've got no respect,\" said Rameth Thomas.\n\nThere are several signs at the base of Uluru that urge tourists not to climb, but many have proceeded anyway.\n\n\"It's difficult to see what that significance is,\" one man who climbed this week told the BBC. \"It's a rock. It's supposed to be climbed.\"\n\nNearby campgrounds and hotels were fully booked this week. This had led to tourists camping illegally and dumping waste, locals said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Tourists have been arriving at Uluru in large numbers\n\nThe climb's closure is not expected to significantly affect visitor rates to the national park, officials and tourism operators say.", "description": "Huge crowds are waiting to make the trek before it is permanently closed to respect Aboriginal wishes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rzj4h.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
