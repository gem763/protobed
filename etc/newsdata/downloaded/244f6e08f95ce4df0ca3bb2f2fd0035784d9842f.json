Photo: Michelle Groskopf\n\nSoon after Michael Tubbs became mayor of Stockton, California, at the age of 26 \u2014 the youngest to be elected to a city of over 100,000 and Stockton\u2019s first African-American mayor \u2014 he directed his policy fellows to research ways to reduce poverty. Four years earlier, in 2012, the city had declared bankruptcy, and it was still mired with high unemployment and crime. The team came back to report that one way to end poverty was to give people money.\n\nThis solution had a name, \u201cuniversal basic income\u201d (or UBI), and a long history in America as a social-policy idea. It had been embraced by Thomas Paine and Milton Friedman and made a cornerstone of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign advanced by Martin Luther King Jr. Both Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter had proposed replacing welfare with a guaranteed income. More recently, the idea had been revived by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, who saw it as a remedy for the burgeoning \u201cuseless class\u201d \u2014 all those people whose jobs technology is making obsolete.\n\nTubbs was skeptical, but the following May he attended a conference on the future of work, where he sat next to the economist and developer Natalie Foster. Along with Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, Foster had launched an advocacy group dedicated to advancing the conversation about guaranteed income. She told Tubbs they were looking for a test city, and he suggested that Stockton might be the perfect place.\n\nLess than two years later, this past February, the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration gave 130 individuals, randomly selected from neighborhoods with a median household income at or below Stockton\u2019s $46,033, their first monthly payment of $500, no strings attached. Over the program\u2019s 18 months, SEED would track how the money was being spent and assess the subjects\u2019 financial security and well-being as well as more subtle measures of the money\u2019s impact, such as their feelings of hope and of mattering.\n\nThere\u2019s perhaps no better city to stress-test UBI than Stockton. \u201cStockton is a microcosm for the rest of the country,\u201d says Mayor Tubbs, \u201cif you look at our population, if you look at our demographics, if you look at our history. People talk about the Midwest, but you have a similar confluence of automation, loss of manufacturing jobs, low educational attainment, poverty, and violence in Stockton, not too far from Silicon Valley.\u201d As in the rest of the country, home prices in Stockton are rising faster than wages. Someone earning the minimum wage of $12 would have to work 78 hours per week to afford the average rent for an apartment without being \u201crent burdened\u201d \u2014 meaning not spending more than 30 percent of your paycheck on it. Across the country, members of the middle class have steadily lost hope that their children will enjoy a better lifestyle than they do, a sentiment that has been expressed in Stockton through the conventional wisdom that you had to leave if you wanted any chance of success. That\u2019s certainly the lesson that Tubbs, now 29, received as a kid. He grew up poor in the south end of town. His mom was a teenager when he was born, and his dad has been incarcerated for almost Tubbs\u2019s entire life. Normally, those facts would consign a child to failing schools, violent neighborhoods, and blunted expectations. \u201cThe world I was born into was shaped by structures that had nothing to do with me or my family,\u201d Tubbs says when we talk in his office in August. His mother and his aunt had the chance to get him out using their father\u2019s military pension \u2014 the very first form of public assistance in the U.S., established in 1792 for disabled veterans of the Revolutionary War. They put Tubbs, his brother, and his cousins into a private elementary school, which set him on an alternate trajectory that eventually landed him at Stanford University. While there, Tubbs secured internships at Google and the White House. His plan was to land a job at a consulting firm so he could take care of his mother, aunt, and grandmother, who had all sacrificed for him to have a better future. One morning while at the White House, Tubbs got a call from his mom. His cousin had been murdered at a house party. \u201cWhat was the point of me being at Stanford, what was the point of me being at the White House, if I was powerless to help my own family?\u201d he said in a TED Talk last spring. In his senior year, Tubbs decided to return home and run for City Council, representing his old neighborhood in South Stockton. That was 2012, arguably the lowest point in the city\u2019s history: Stockton had just declared bankruptcy, the first major city in the United States to do so, after earning the title of foreclosure capital of the country during the mortgage crisis. Forbes had named Stockton the most miserable city in America twice. Tubbs won the City Council race. Four years later, in November 2016, he was elected mayor. When he began looking into UBI, no American city had yet to try it. Large-scale social-science experiments were carried out in the 1960s and \u201970s to test the concept, particularly whether giving people money would discourage them from working. Studies in the U.S. and Canada showed a small decline in labor-force participation, but it was mostly attributed to new mothers\u2019 taking longer maternity leaves and to teenage boys\u2019 staying in school rather than dropping out to work. Attendance, grades, and test scores, especially for younger kids from poorer families, went up. In Canada, in the only study to measure health outcomes, participants had fewer hospital visits. Yet Southern Democrats shot down Nixon\u2019s UBI proposal in part because, \u201cdirect payments to poor people in the South, especially poor blacks in the South, would have disrupted the economic model that a lot of the Southern economy was based on,\u201d explains sociologist Brian Steensland, who authored The Failed Welfare Revolution, a history of UBI in the United States. The South\u2019s economy depended on African Americans for low wage labor. \u201cI can\u2019t get anybody to iron my shirts!\u201d shouted Louisiana Senator Russell Long during a hearing. After SEED was announced, conservative commentators ridiculed the plan. \u201cMayor of bankrupt city will give free money to the poor,\u201d read one tweet from Chuck Woolery, the conservative podcaster. Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin shared an article about the program with the comment \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding!\u201d Tubbs, a master of the clapback, tweeted in reply, \u201cActually modeled after the Alaska Permanent Fund. Are you familiar with it?\u201d Since 1982, Palin\u2019s own state has put 25 percent of its oil revenues into a fund that pays dividends to every adult and child in Alaska in the form of a cash dividend that ranges from a couple of hundred to a couple of thousand dollars a year. It\u2019s part of the data that advocates of guaranteed income cite to prove unconditional cash doesn\u2019t encourage people to work less. But the criticism was telling. A blog post published by the SEED team, led by 23-year-old Stanford graduate Sukhi Samra, acknowledges that \u201cdata alone doesn\u2019t change hearts and minds,\u201d which is why the team allowed me to follow a handful of subjects. I\u2019ve sat in their homes, met their families (and their dogs), learned intimate details of their lives as told through their financial histories. They shared their hopes and fears and how this money has helped (or not) to achieve or assuage them. The recipients weren\u2019t chosen to be a representative sample \u2014 they were simply the people who volunteered. Still, their stories do represent the many ways the American Dream eludes people. SEED\u2019s preliminary report from the first six months provides a bigger picture: 43 percent of recipients are working full or part time and 10 percent are looking for work, while 30 percent can\u2019t work because they are disabled or a primary caregiver. Their median monthly household income is $1,800. Researcher Amy Castro Baker of the University of Pennsylvania says the results so far suggest that \u201cpeople are rational and strategic when leveraging the $500.\u201d My own experience has been that the money doesn\u2019t change the recipients\u2019 behavior \u2014 if anything, it serves as an accelerant for whatever path they were already on \u2014 but it is changing their lives by making them less stressful. \u201cMy hope is, as the stories [of the recipients] get out, that people begin to see themselves, their neighbors, and people they have warm feelings for,\u201d Tubbs says, \u201cand not this caricature we create in our minds when it\u2019s someone different who we think is undeserving.\u201d Read More\n\nThis project was supported by a grant from the investigative news site Capital & Main.\n\nI.

What is this?, she thought, wondering if it was a scam. That night, she was watching the local news and it mentioned the SEED program. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I just got that letter,\u2019 \u201d she says. She filled out the questionnaire but missed a section and couldn\u2019t use the back button to complete it. Oh well, she thought. The whole idea that someone would give her $500 a month seemed so far-fetched anyway. Then, a week or two later, she got a text saying she\u2019d been selected to receive the money.\n\n\u201cIt was very surreal,\u201d she says. We\u2019re talking in the SEED office downtown, where she has come after work to fill out the paperwork to get the debit card on which she\u2019ll begin receiving her monthly disbursements. She has never met any of the staff before; they\u2019ve communicated only by text, with the last message instructing her to come to this address. Her husband dropped her off, and she told him to note the building number \u201cif anything happens to me,\u201d she says. As I start to reassure her, she waves away my concern. \u201cThat\u2019s just me. I worry,\u201d she says. \u201cI never stop worrying or having anxiety.\u201d\n\nContinue reading Danielle\u2019s story.\n\nII.

It\u2019s three days before the first disbursement. We sit side by side on a bed in her living room, which is otherwise empty except for a crib and a large playpen containing a few toys and stuffed animals. Grace\u2019s 1-year-old daughter, Jackie, is with her father so Grace can focus on her career. She and Jackie\u2019s father are \u201con a kind of break,\u201d she says.\n\nGrace tells me she just got back from a ski trip to Lake Tahoe with a group of 40 \u201cwomen in tech\u201d organized by Arielle Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s younger sister. She shows me pictures on Facebook of herself among the women gathered in front of the ski lodge\u2019s fireplace, all of them wearing matching facial masks. Grace doesn\u2019t ski, so she rented the gear and bought herself a jacket and ski pants, putting about a thousand dollars on a credit card.\n\nContinue reading Grace\u2019s story.\n\nIII.

Her Pomeranian-Yorkie, Poopee, stands beside her. \u201cI guess they haven\u2019t got to the gate,\u201d she calls down after I get out of my car. The gate into the complex requires a code, but Laura told me on the phone that people keep busting through it, so I might be able to just drive in.\n\nLaura, who is 68, moved to Stockton from Oakland five years ago in search of more affordable rents. She\u2019d just been fired from her job at the Oracle Arena after working there for 21 years. She collects about $1,500 a month in Social Security and a small pension for her years as a union officer in the SEIU, which isn\u2019t enough to live on in the Bay Area.\n\nContinue reading Laura\u2019s story.\n\nIV.

Small ranch homes with three-car garages line the street. Cars pack the driveways, one behind the other, suggesting households with too many adults in them. We were supposed to meet elsewhere, but Greg\u2019s car is leaking brake fluid and he barely made it home from work. When I arrive, the 1999 white Integra is sitting in the driveway with its hood up.\n\nGreg comes out in jeans and a dark T-shirt. He has a short goatee, and his face is covered in freckles, which make him look younger than his 30 years. His head is shaved, and he rubs it a lot when he talks. Later, he\u2019ll tell me he has gray hairs from stressing too much. Greg has four kids, two girls and two boys, who range in age from 2 to 8.\n\nWe drive to a park and talk in my rental car. Greg tells me he\u2019s going to try to sell the Integra tonight because he doesn\u2019t want to bother fixing it. He has been saving up for a new car, an older BMW for $1,100. \u201cIt\u2019s tagged and smogged and good to go,\u201d he says. He just needs his $500 tomorrow morning and somebody to drive him. Greg plans to use future SEED disbursements to pay off his debts. \u201cSo by next year, I\u2019ll be able to possibly get me and my kids a house or something like that. Get us going instead of just the same cycle going over and over again.\u201d\n\nContinue reading Greg\u2019s story.\n\nV. P h y l l i s Phyllis knows she\u2019s more than her circumstances.\n\nPhyllis at her office.

I h a v e c a n c e r . \u2019 \u2019\n\nI ring Phyllis\u2019s doorbell, setting off a cacophony of barking inside. I can hear Phyllis directing her daughter to put this dog in the kennel, that one outside, hold on to the other one. When she finally opens the door, she\u2019s gripping the collar of a large pit-bull mix who eyes me suspiciously. \u201cJust stand still and let her smell you,\u201d she says. \u201cCome on, Bella, easy.\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes later, Phyllis and I are on the couch in her living room and Bella is spread across our laps. She\u2019s my 85-pound lapdog, Phyllis says, stroking her head. A big frisky puppy, Marley, tries to join us on the couch, but Bella growls, warning her away. The two small dogs, Lilly and Max, and Phyllis\u2019s 13-year-old daughter wander in and out. An inversion table stands in the middle of the living room. Family photos, ceramic tchotchkes, and a menorah decorate an armoire. A nail-gun compressor, two different vacuum cleaners, and a case of seltzer line the low wall marking off the dining area.\n\nA week or so before Phyllis\u2019s SEED letter arrived, Phyllis got a call from her doctor with the results of a biopsy of a nodule on her thyroid. She was at work, on two different phone lines, registering clients for Covered California, the state\u2019s version of Obamacare. Phyllis sells insurance and provides investment advice. She clicked over to the doctor, and he told her she had cancer that required surgery. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you Wednesday. I don\u2019t have time to deal with this now.\u201d\n\nPhyllis headed straight home after work. Her husband had taken the puppy to the vet that day because she\u2019d been limping after chasing a ball into a wall. \u201cThe minute I walked in the door, he tells me, \u2018Marley broke her kneecap. She needs surgery. It\u2019s going to cost like $7,000 or $8,000.\u2019 He finishes telling me everything, and I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to need surgery, too.\u2019 He said, \u2018Why?\u2019 I said, \u2018My thyroid. I have cancer.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Oh. Well, what are we going to do about the dog? How are we going to pay for this?\u2019 \u201d Phyllis rolls her eyes at me and laughs ruefully.\n\nContinue reading Phyllis\u2019s story.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the October 14, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
