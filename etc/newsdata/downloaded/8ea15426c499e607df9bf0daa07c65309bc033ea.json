And he\u2019s really well behaved for how young he is. The guys have enjoyed him.\u201d\n\nNHL EARLY SURPRISES: Anaheim Ducks, John Gibson among the good ones\n\nNHL POINT PROJECTIONS: How we see the 2019-20 season unfolding\n\nAlex Ovechkin sits with the Capitals' new dog, Captain. (Photo: Courtesy: Washington Capitals)\n\nThe Capitals\u2019 new 11-week-old puppy named Captain walked on the opening-night red carpet with team captain Alex Ovechkin and he was an instant crowd-pleaser. Captain is a Labrador-Golden Retriever mix.\n\nErica Sandidge, the Capitals\u2019 marketing coordinator, said the Capitals\u2019 decision to adopt a dog was a response to popular demand.\n\n\u201cA lot of our players have dogs and a lot of fan groups had posted to us that they were hoping we would get a dog,\u201d Sandidge said. \u201cWe had a lot of support for dogs within the community.\u201d\n\nThe Blues adopted Barclay, a yellow Labrador Retriever, last season in order to socialize him to become a service dog. A December video of the puppy running around the ice after practice with a hockey stick in its mouth went viral and Barclay got to eat from the Stanley Cup after the Blues won their first championship.\n\nWhat the Capitals have noticed immediately about Captain is that he likes hockey gloves.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his newest toy,\u201d Sandidge said. \u201cHe loves the smell and the texture of the glove because he can chew on it. Every time a player comes over, he nips at their glove. Then they pet him and pick him up.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals are working through America\u2019s Vet Dogs, a New York-based organization that trains service dogs for disabled veterans and first responders.\n\nWhile with the Capitals, Captain is being trained as a service dog, meaning he will only be with the team for 14-16 months. He then will be given a permanent placement as a service dog.\n\nThe Coyotes\u2019 dog, Luna, a purebred black Lab, is also being prepared to become a service dog to a military veteran, meaning she will be with the team this season and part of next season.\n\n\u201cOn Twitter, when they post something about her, fans go crazy,\u201d Coyotes player Vinnie Hinostroza said. \u201cThis is nice for the vet, and nice for us to have a dog around the locker room to make us smile and for the fans to have something else to follow.\u201d\n\nHinostroza said as the players were going on the ice for practice Wednesday, Luna \u201cwas buzzing around the hallway with a jersey on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was nice to get a pet in before we went on the ice,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure when she gets bigger, she will become more brave.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s still training to do. \u201cShe is kind of scared of us when we have all of our gear on,\u201d Hinostroza said.\n\nKennedy said Smash, a mixed breed who has been with the Predators for nine months since being adopted from Keely\u2019s Friends Dog Rescue, occasionally comes into the corporate office. He thinks nothing of using his nose to push open doors and enter meetings. He\u2019s always welcome.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a mild-mannered, fun element to everything we do,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cHe\u2019s not disruptive. He\u2019s not a loud presence. He\u2019s a sweet, little dog that has stolen a lot of hearts in Smashville.\u201d\n\nSmash is not being trained as a service dog, so he will be with the Predators long-term. Kennedy jokes that Smash has a larger social media presence than anyone in the corporate office. He\u2019s frequently shown on the Jumbotron during games.\n\n\u201cSmash is an integral part of what we are,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe have Smash trading cards. We have Smash socks. We started (selling) merchandise with his image on it because he has become a popular little fellow.\u201d", "description": "Ten NHL teams now boast official team dogs, and that number may grow because team dogs are becoming as popular as players.
