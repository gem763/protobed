Those employees are compensated for preparing, practicing and playing, the latter done faithfully even when the other duties aren\u2019t reflected in the outcome.\n\nAnd remember, no matter how bad you feel, frustration in the Washington locker room was higher than anywhere else in metropolitan D.C. after Sunday\u2019s 33-7 defeat against the New England Patriots.\n\n\u201c0-5 is not fun,\u201d quarterback Colt McCoy said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been 0-5. I doubt that many guys in that room have been 0-5. But it\u2019s not for lack of effort.\u201d\n\nHe got the start, playing his first game since suffering a leg injury Dec. 3. He actually \u201cled\u201d Washington on a 67-yard scoring drive on the team\u2019s second possession, by executing deft ball-handling on a 65-yard touchdown run by Steven Sims.\n\nMcCoy faked an inside handoff to Adrian Peterson and gave the ball to Sims, headed around right end. A juke and a couple of missed tackles on the sideline gave Washington a lead that it nursed for a whole 10 minutes.\n\nThere were moments when you entertained wild thoughts, imagining that the winless home team would topple the undefeated Super Bowl champs. But those were fleeting and spiritless visions, despite New England being held to a touchdown and two field goals at the break.\n\nWashington sacked Tom Brady three times in the first half. Safety Montae Nicholson snared an interception at the 1-yard line to snuff a threat after Trey Quinn fumbled. A 12-7 deficit as the second half began might\u2019ve inspired hope \u2026 except New England had 13 points at intermission three weeks ago en route tp beating the Miami Dolphins 43-0.\n\nSpeaking of which, Miami is up next for Washington and one of those teams will likely record its initial 2019 win.\n\nBut, again, even if Washington prevails, fans are forced to wonder, \u201cWhere\u2019s this thing headed?\u201d Coach Jay Gruden must be asking the same thing amid rampant speculation that his firing might be imminent.\n\n\u201cNobody has told me anything and I don\u2019t have a concern,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI\u2019ll just wait and see. If the key works on Monday, I\u2019ll keep working, go attack the Miami Dolphins and plan on getting our first win next week.\u201d\n\nIf that win comes to fruition, it will enjoy little company in a season that smells like 3-13 or 4-12.\n\nThe remaining home games \u2014 against San Francisco, the New York Jets, Detroit, Philadelphia, and the New York Giants \u2014 figure to bring more throngs of enemy fans to FedEx Field, where road teams make themselves comfortable. Being embarrassed in the stands while your squad is embarrassed on the field isn\u2019t a very appealing option for spending your Sunday afternoon.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like continuing to root for an organization where the management is, I don\u2019t know, inaccessible, unaccountable and dysfunctional.\n\nGruden has to answer for the way his team commits penalties, comes out for second halves, and practices throughout the week. But he also has dealt with a preponderance of injuries, contract impasses and top-down culture issues beyond his control and absent among most peers.\n\nWith his job as secure as dandelions in a hurricane, does he feel like he\u2019s gotten a fair shake?\n\n\u201cYou know \u2026 it\u2019s \u2026.\u201d he began, searching for the filter that often escapes him before enacting it this time. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been provided ample opportunities to succeed around here. I\u2019ve got good players; I\u2019ve got a good staff. Just haven\u2019t produced on Sundays. Or Mondays. So gotta do better.\u201d\n\nAs long as he\u2019s allowed on the premises in Ashburn, he\u2019ll keep trying. So will the players, who talked about circling wagons instead of pointing fingers, about going back to the drawing board instead of writing off one another. To their credit, they haven\u2019t given up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on a couple of teams like this,\u201d said veteran offensive tackle Donald Penn, who once was 0-10 with Oakland, and also endured starts of 0-7 and 0-8 with Tampa Bay. \u201cOne thing I like about this team is we\u2019re staying together. No one is blaming each other.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s on them to perform better, regardless of who\u2019s the coach, who\u2019s the rookie quarterback, and who had the bright idea to marry the two when a rational organization would\u2019ve chosen one or the other. They\u2019ll all stay at it because it\u2019s their responsibility as professionals.\n\nThey\u2019re paid to show up and stick around.\n\nBut given Washington\u2019s malignant ownership and management, why should fans?\n\n\u2022 Brooklyn-born and Howard-educated, Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
