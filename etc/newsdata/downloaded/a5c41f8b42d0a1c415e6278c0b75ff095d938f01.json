Biden Jr. escalated his criticism of his most formidable rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, suggesting that she was not being forthright about the costs of her far-reaching policy proposals and questioning her \u201ccredibility.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden zeroed in on Ms. Warren\u2019s refusal to say if she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a single-payer health care system that would all but eliminate private health insurance. While other candidates are pouncing on that issue as well, Mr. Biden is under particular pressure because Ms. Warren has passed him in some national and early-state polls and joined him as a front-runner, a status he held alone for months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people across the board,\u201d Mr. Biden said, addressing reporters on a cold, gray afternoon outside a union electrical trade center.\n\n\u201cAnd, you know, credibility matters. It matters. And the question that I think that Senator Warren is going to have to face, she\u2019s going to have to tell the truth or the question will be raised about whether or not she\u2019s going to be candid and honest with the American people,\u201d he said.", "description": "A day after they sparred in a Democratic presidential debate, Mr. Biden aimed more criticism at Ms. Warren, who has joined him as a front-runner.", "authors": ["Katie Glueck"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/us/politics/16biden-warren/16biden-warren-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
