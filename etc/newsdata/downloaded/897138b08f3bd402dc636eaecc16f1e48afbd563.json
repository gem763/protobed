He\u2019s a 73-year-old belligerent tosspot who once chucked a pissy tantrum because producers wouldn\u2019t let him mock trans people on live TV. Nevertheless, he\u2019s back in the news today, mere hours out from his thoroughly unearned television return. This time a 16-year-old has made him so unfathomably mad that he\u2019s burst a capillary all over social media.\n\nNewman is the latest in a string of cranky old fuckwits to become utterly incensed at Greta Thunberg because she is refusing to shut up and die quietly on the flaming space rock they\u2019ve left for her.\n\nTaking to Twitter, the only platform he has left to freely spout his insane bullshit as age overtakes him and he slowly fades into the void, Newman labelled Thunberg an \u201cannoying little brat,\u201d a \u201cshit,\u201d and referred to the thrice-hundred proven climate crisis as \u201cso-called\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d\n\nThis annoying little brat addressed the UN on the so-called climate crisis. WHO lets this shit have a platform? Mendacious, inbred sycophants, that who. #ClimateChangeHoax pic.twitter.com/W1fvYdtFSW \u2014 Sam Newman (@Origsmartassam) September 24, 2019\n\nNewman is set to take the stage tonight for the TV return of The Footy Show that very few, if any, people wanted. Channel Nine (who wholly owns this publication but refuses to let me heckle Peter Hitchener during news broadcasts) seems to have no problem funding and airing this frankly insane spectacle of wax museum minstrelism, and it appears unlikely Sam\u2019s thesaurus-breaking efforts in the above will change that this close to air time.\n\nREAD MORE Scott Morrison Really Wants The Kids To Pipe Down About The Fact The Planet's Dying\n\nThere\u2019s some solace to be had in the knowledge that Newman will probably shuffle off this mortal coil before climate change has a chance to melt the mound of plastic currently residing rent-free beneath the faberg\u00e9 skin on his face. And that as far as wider public discourse goes, his petulant sooking represents a blip on the radar that\u2019s shrinking as quickly as his bone density.\n\n\u2018Course until then he\u2019s free to write whatever insane, self-important screed he wishes on Twitter. Which just means he\u2019s also able to be dunked on as spectacularly as this.\n\nsam newman your house sucks shit man i was one of the contractors who worked on it and it fucken sucks. also your coke stash is shit too. eat my dick hole you wrinkly old bitch! haha \u2014 rip snorter (@lukesesh) September 24, 2019\n\n\u201cYour house sucks shit man,\u201d my god.
