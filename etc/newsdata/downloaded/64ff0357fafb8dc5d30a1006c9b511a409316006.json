Finding food on the front line of climate change 1/17 Balkisa Zakow, 25, with her twins Hassan and Ousseni, Tombokiery village, Niger At nine months\u2019 pregnant with twins Balkisa Zakow, 25, feared she wouldn\u2019t have the energy to give birth. A devastating drought made Balkisa\u2019s harvests fail, made food prices soar, and then forced her family apart. Her husband migrated in search of work to earn money to provide for his young family, leaving her heavily pregnant and alone. \u201cSometimes if my husband had money he sent it to me so I could eat. Sometimes the money just doesn\u2019t come,\u201d she said. \u201cI was worried I wouldn\u2019t have the energy to give birth.\u201d But seven-month-old twins Hassan and Ousseni are lucky, they were born the night after Red Cross support came to Tombokiery village, Niger. The Niger Red Cross provided the family with a small cash grant. \u201cA Niger Red Cross volunteer told me to go first because she saw how exhausted I was. I used the money to buy food, then I went back home to sleep feeling relieved. Before sunrise I had given birth to my twins.\u201d Yuki Sugiura/British Red Cross 2/17 Aissa Garba, 65, gazes out of the window of her home in Tombokiery village, southern Niger Last year\u2019s drought made Aissa\u2019s crop fail, leaving the family with nothing to eat. In the Sahel rainfall has become erratic and wet seasons that people rely on are shrinking. The Sahel has one of the driest climates in the world, people who live here have always been incredibly resilient, are now having to adapt and survive to ever harsher conditions. The region is almost one degree hotter than in 1970 and could rise by several degrees by the end of the century. Record hot spells, desertification, loss of crops and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns are reducing people\u2019s ability to feed themselves. Mothers are forced to eat just one meal a day so that their children can eat.

Rabi said: \u201cI had been feeding her cassava flour but I noticed didn\u2019t help her much. When she has plumpy nut it helps a lot but sometimes there isn\u2019t any.

Stems are stripped by hand and the grain pounded into flour which is slowly mixed with boiling water to make two, a thick white paste which is a staple across the region. Alternatively, water can be added to the flour to make porridge. Millet is a good source of carbohydrate but eaten alone lacks the vital nutrients needed as part of a balanced diet.
