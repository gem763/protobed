But from a locker room perspective, what we have is a potential issue, and it comes down to this: Either Adrian Peterson is here to run the football, or he can\u2019t be here at all.\n\nPeterson is 34, entering his 13th NFL season. On the 149 previous game days on which he was healthy and eligible, he played. On Sunday, he was ready to start his second season with the Washington Redskins, ready for the Philadelphia Eagles. And he was scratched.\n\nPut the math to the side for a second. For a guy whose blazer measurements have probably already been sent to Canton, Ohio, there\u2019s an emotional element to this that comes first.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s not a role I want,\u201d Peterson said to a bank of cameras and microphones following Washington\u2019s 32-27 loss. \u201cI\u2019m 13 years in, and I\u2019ve still got it. I\u2019ve shown that, of course. I can play the game.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, I\u2019m not the owner. I\u2019m just a player. So when they call me up, they call me up. I\u2019ll be ready to play. And if for whatever reason I\u2019m not playing, I can\u2019t control that. So I don\u2019t know what to tell you or what to say.\u201d\n\n[Even after a demoralizing collapse, Redskins remain upbeat about loss to Eagles]\n\nThus, it\u2019s prudent to turn to Gruden. The coach can clearly justify this on a given Sunday, because the team is committed to second-year man Derrius Guice to be the featured back, and he needs pure bodies to play special teams \u2014 particularly in punt coverage, which a player of Peterson\u2019s stature would never be asked to do.\n\nAnd yet listen to Gruden outline exactly what it would take to get Peterson dressed on game day should Guice, third-down back Chris Thompson and special teams contributor Wendell Smallwood all be healthy. Here comes the math.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a first- and second-down back,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cSo is Derrius. So, really, what do we have? About 20 first downs a game. Probably eight of those are passes, 12 of those might be runs, and Derrius can handle those 12. So if we have a game where we think we can run the ball 55 times in a game in an I-formation, then sure, I\u2019ll get him up.\u201d\n\nDid you catch that sarcasm from the coach? No? Let\u2019s spell it out: In its entire franchise history, Washington has run the ball 55 times exactly once. Not to put words into Gruden\u2019s mouth, but here are some others he might have said instead: \u201cIt ain\u2019t happening.\u201d\n\nThere was a way to make this all go away, to make it a footnote going forward rather than a driving story line that could upset the balance in the locker room, and that was to beat the Eagles on Sunday. Washington, as you know by now, could have done just that, leading 17-0 in the second quarter. Who needs Peterson when rookie wideout Terry McLaurin can stretch the field and veteran quarterback Case Keenum has the savvy to keep both plays and drives alive?\n\nBut how do you milk a lead like that? You run the football. Behind a suspect offensive line, Guice couldn\u2019t do it. After Washington took that massive advantage, Guice carried just four times. His output on those chew-up-the-clock carries: two yards. Total rushing yards for Washington on Sunday: 28. Times Washington failed to reach that total in 2018, when Peterson was active for all 16 games: once, in the season finale against the Eagles, when the team was down to its fourth quarterback.\n\n\u201cThis is a team that loads up the box,\u201d Gruden explained, and he\u2019s not wrong. But given how the rest of the game played out, it makes you wonder how Peterson \u2014 a veteran who knows all the game\u2019s tricks, who understands situations, who can find the extra yard when it would hide from others \u2014 might have fared.\n\n[Three takeaways from Redskins\u2019 season-opening loss to Eagles]\n\nKeep in mind, too, exactly the circumstances in which Peterson arrived in Washington: Guice went down with a torn ACL in the 2018 preseason, and Peterson walked from the unemployment line directly into a 1,042-yard season. Given the surroundings Sunday, it\u2019s hard to forget how 90 of those yards came \u2014 on a Monday night against the Eagles up the middle at Lincoln Financial Field, the longest run in Washington history.\n\nThat guy wasn\u2019t worthy of a jersey? For a team that hasn\u2019t won a playoff game in the previous 13 seasons?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve kind of grasped it yet,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time ever being inactive, a healthy scratch. It was tough, of course. I\u2019m a super competitor. I\u2019ve been thinking about playing these guys since last year, since the season ended.\u201d\n\nSo mix in the result on the scoreboard with the stats in the box score, sprinkle in the quiet pride displayed by the victim, and don\u2019t sleep on how this decision went over in the locker room.\n\n\u201cAs a running back room, we want everybody to be dressed out, especially a guy like that,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a decision that we obviously don\u2019t make.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled the quiet chuckle of a mystified man.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have too many walking Hall of Famers on your football team,\u201d veteran offensive tackle Morgan Moses said. \u201c. . . Obviously, we think he\u2019s a hell of a football player, he has a hell of a lot of juice left. Hopefully, it\u2019s just a one-week thing and we can move forward.\u201d\n\nExcept here\u2019s the truth: It\u2019s not a one-week thing, and Gruden knows that. Running back is a young man\u2019s position, and Washington is committed to the young man it drafted to play that position, even if his career output, after Sunday\u2019s 10-carry, 18-yard performance, is \u2014 give me a minute to add this up \u2014 10 carries for 18 yards.\n\nIt makes you wonder why Peterson was on the roster in the first place. Asked if there\u2019s still a place for him, Gruden said, \u201cThere is, for sure.\u201d Approximately two minutes later, he broke down what it would take to get Peterson in uniform on game day.\n\nThe problem, when it comes to Washington, is that no potentially controversial decision can be viewed in a vacuum. Gruden simultaneously saying there\u2019s a place for Peterson while outlining how unlikely he is to play makes you wonder if there are other forces at work. At Washington\u2019s annual Welcome Home Luncheon, Peterson accepted the award as last year\u2019s offensive MVP. Would Daniel Snyder, the team owner, and Bruce Allen, the team president, really endorse cutting a player who had just been so honored?\n\nWhatever the justification for keeping Peterson on the team but not dressing him against the Eagles, it\u2019s not a sustainable situation. As professional as Peterson was Sunday \u2014 \u201cI was trying to be the best coach I could be today,\u201d he said \u2014 he wasn\u2019t happy. If the jerseys are distributed in the same way going forward, that won\u2019t get better. He is too accomplished a character and too massive a presence to make into a cheerleader. There are only two options: play him or set him free.", "description": "Washington\u2019s future Hall of Famer running back was a healthy scratch for the first time in his career.
