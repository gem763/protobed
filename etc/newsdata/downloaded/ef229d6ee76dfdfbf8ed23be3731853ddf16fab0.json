REUTERS/Tom Nicholson/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party is focused on finding a compromise timetable to consider Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal in parliament, but remains opposed to the divorce agreement, finance policy chief John McDonnell said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process at the moment of trying to see whether or not this compromise we\u2019ve offered to Boris Johnson will enable him to bring forward a proper program motion (timetable),\u201d McDonnell told reporters.\n\nParliament rejected Johnson\u2019s attempt on Tuesday to fast track the legislation before an Oct. 31 exit deadline, with opponents saying it needed more scrutiny than the government had offered.\n\nThat leaves Johnson with the choice of agreeing a longer timetable that would mean missing his Oct. 31 deadline but could see Brexit delivered this year, or pushing for an early general election that would mean a longer delay to Brexit but could give him the outright majority in parliament he currently lacks.\n\nMcDonnell, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s most senior ally, said the party was offering a timetable only \u201cdays\u201d longer than the one Johnson proposed.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a matter of weeks, it is a matter of days,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he reiterated that Labour would not support the deal as it currently stands and, if parliament resumed the process of passing the law needed to implement it, they would seek to make its passage conditional on a second referendum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being accused all the time of trying to prevent the Brexit process happening. We\u2019re not, we\u2019re just saying we want a proper process,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat must include the ability to put amendments up and that must include the ability to put an amendment up that enables it to go back to the people.\u201d", "description": "Britain's opposition Labour Party is focused on finding a compromise timetable to consider Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal in parliament, but remains opposed to the divorce agreement, finance policy chief John McDonnell said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444506998&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N162", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
