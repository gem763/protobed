Now that summer heat has carried over into the remainder of the year.\n\nAccording to new climate data, last month tied for the hottest September on record in our planet's history.\n\nReuters\n\nData from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the EU's climate monitoring agency, shows that this past September was 1.2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average. It was also 0.57 degrees Celsius above the average September temperatures between 1981 to 2010. That puts it \"virtually on par\" with September of 2016, which C3S says was 0.02 degrees Celsius warmer than this past month.\n\nThe data shows that central and eastern USA, the Mongolian plateau and parts of the Arctic experienced the worst temperature climb. Iran, Afghanistan, Mongolia and northern China also experienced \"markedly above average\" temperatures in the month.\n\nC3S\n\nDon't Miss 289 SHARES 322 SHARES\n\nIt's just another sucker punch in the barrage that's been the effects of climate change. We've seen temperatures steadily climbing over the last few years, even as our icebergs melt, forests ignite in blazes, and even the arctic has wildfires sparked.\n\nIt might not have been as worrisome if it was a warm September by itself. But it's terrifying after the past few months have been exceptionally warm, during the summer cycle of the Northern hemisphere. After this last July, the hottest month ever recorded on Earth, it means the rest of of year might be far too warm as well.\n\nReuters\n\nAnd who knows how much worse it'll get next year?\n\nIt's just another blatant display of what happens when we forget to care for the environment. The world might survive, even greatly changed, but just a few shifts in temperature, rainfall, and sea levels could end human life as we know it. And that's exactly why we need to act immediately.", "description": "This year has been one of the hottest on record, with July as the hottest month ever.
