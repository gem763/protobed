EA, -1.23% are off 1.3% in premarket trading Tuesday after Barclays analysts Deepak Mathivanan and Mario Lu cut their rating on the stock to equal weight from overweight, writing that the bulk of earnings-per-share growth next year is expected to come from buybacks and not business fundamentals. \"After a string of disappointing results from the last 'Star Wars' title, 'Battlefield V,' and 'Anthem,' we think investors will need to see a couple of successful title releases before EA's multiple reverts back to its historical mean,\" the analysts wrote in a note to clients.
