While the clip shows Humphrey\u2019s hands pushing Beckham\u2019s jersey up around his neck, the story insists the Ravens defensive back did nothing wrong.\n\nKitchens was upset that Humphrey was not ejected and reached out to the NFL for clarification about the incident in Cleveland\u2019s 40-25 win. Kitchens did not divulge any specifics about his conversation with the league.\n\n\u201cWe talked, and I got an understanding moving forward,\u201d Kitchens said when asked if he was satisfied with the league\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll compliment Odell for this: In that instance, he did an excellent job of not retaliating. I would say that. I thought he was in some positions all day, difficult situations all day, and I thought he handled it fairly well.\u201d\n\nBrowns right tackle Chris Hubbard scoffed at the idea that the Ravens believe Humphrey wasn\u2019t choking Beckham.\n\n\u201cYou look at the video, I looked at it this morning,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cThe dude is really like trying to strangle my brother. Something has to be done about that, no matter what it is. You can\u2019t have that in this league.\u201d\n\nHubbard and Browns guard Joel Bitonio found if laughable that the Ravens would go to such lengths to defend Humphrey.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of messed up that they did say that,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cIt\u2019s evident. It\u2019s on film. And they need to take consequences on his actions.\u201d\n\nSpokesman Brian McCarthy said the league had no further comment beyond what referee Shawn Hochuli said in a pool report following Sunday\u2019s game. Hochuli said it was the opinion of his crew that Humphrey\u2019s actions didn\u2019t rise to the level of \u201ca disqualifying foul.\u201d\n\nBoth Humphrey and Beckham are expected to be fined later this week for their actions.\n\nHubbard was shocked Humphrey wasn\u2019t ejected.\n\n\u201cVery surprised, because it\u2019s shown evident on the tape that he\u2019s choking this man out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that should be talked about.\u201d\n\nBeckham, who was held to two catches for 20 yards, declined to be interviewed during the few minutes he was in the Browns locker room while it was open to reporters.\n\nBitonio said the video clearly shows Humphrey\u2019s hands were on Beckham\u2019s throat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you want to say he was in the act of choking or not, but his hands were on his throat, he was on top of him,\u201d Bitonio said. \u201cI think there\u2019s clear evidence of that - video evidence. Do I know if he was trying to two-hand strangle him or not? No. I haven\u2019t even really talked to Odell about exactly what happened, what he thought happened.\n\n\u201cBut you know they\u2019re trying to cover it up. They\u2019re trying to make their player look as good as possible. But I mean the guy was on top of him on the ground with his hands around his neck. Something was happening. Even if you weren\u2019t choking him, that\u2019s not a football act right there. So something was going on that was inappropriate.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Ravens coach John Harbaugh steered clear of assessing blame in the Humphrey-Beckham scuffle.\n\n\u201cBased on the close-up that we have of the footage that we had, (Humphrey) pinned him on the ground after about three or four things happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to alleviate him from any responsibility, because we can\u2019t get flags in that situation.\u201d\n\nKitchens insisted the Browns have moved on from the incident, and said he wasn\u2019t bothered by the Ravens defending their player.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter to me what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not care.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Baltimore Ravens feel cornerback Marlon Humphrey isn't guilty of choking Cleveland star receiver Odell Beckham Jr.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/browns_beckham_choked_football_57926_c0-0-3000-1749_s1770x1032.jpg?4ec8ef4b5df28140b7ab4a06fbd1165bdd086b07"}
