He didn\u2019t say it\u2019s despicable, which I just say it is.\u201d\n\nCoppola also said he was working on his biggest project yet: \u201cMegalopolis\u201d, a film about a utopia, a project he has nurtured for two decades.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make a film about a human expression of what really is heaven on earth.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s the most ambitious film (I\u2019ve worked on) \u2014 more than \u2018Apocalypse Now\u2019. That\u2019s the problem,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cApocalypse Now\u201d, his 1979 war epic starring Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando, is notorious for the vast amount of time and money it ate up during production.\n\n\u201cI think it would cost more than \u2018Apocalypse Now\u2019,\u201d said Coppola. \u201cIt would be the biggest budget I ever had to work with.\u201d\n\nCoppola, the director of the \u201cGodfather\u201d films, joins an illustrious list of film-makers and actors to have received the Prix Lumiere, including Scorsese, Pedro Almodovar and Milos Forman.", "description": "Lyon (AFP) \u2013 Francis Ford Coppola jumped into a controversy over the Marvel superhero movies Saturday, not just backing fellow director Martin", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/2ef0fe_us-movie-francis-ford-coppola-was-in-french-city-lyon-receive-lumiere-award-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
