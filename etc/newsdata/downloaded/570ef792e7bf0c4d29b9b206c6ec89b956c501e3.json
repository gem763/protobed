The man, identified as a 60-year-old named Zhang, reportedly claimed he was bitten on his index finger by a Deinagkistrodon acutus while working in the mountains.\n\nThe species is found in Southeastern China, as well as northern Vietnam and parts of Taiwan, and typically prefers shaded habitats in forests, or among rocks in valley streams, according to Animal Diversity Web.\n\nWhile its venom can injure humans, it has also been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and pain in tendons and bones. Not all bites are fatal, but the man allegedly heard that death could be instant so he cut his finger off with his knife, according to AsiaWire.\n\nWOMAN CLAIMS BOTCHED NOSE, CHIN SURGERY LEFT HER WITH CROOKED MOUTH, DROOLING\n\n\u201cI chopped it off to save my life,\u201d he allegedly told his doctor, Yuan Chengda.\n\nChengda, head of dermatology at Hangzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said the man\u2019s actions were \u201creally unnecessary\u201d and that they likely could have reattached his finger had the man brought it with him.\n\nWISCONSIN COMPANY RECALLS 4,000 POUNDS OF BEEF PATTIES OVER METAL CONTAMINATION\n\n\u201cSome people cut their own fingers and toes; others tie string or wire around their limbs,\u201d Chengda told AsiaWire of misinformed snakebite patients. \u201cI\u2019ve even seen people burning themselves to counteract the snake venom. By the time they arrive, their limbs are often necrotic.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChengda said that many patients are wrongly under the impression that death will be instant after the bite. In the majority of cases, as long as treatment is administered in under six hours, the bites shouldn\u2019t be fatal.", "description": "The man thought the bite would kill him within minutes, but his doctor says he was misinformed.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/SkewMouth-02-AsiaWire.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
