I was roughly 12 and living out a library fantasy at one of America\u2019s most storied and beautiful Palladian edifices\u2014Redwood Library in Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nThe air was suffused with plaster and paint that hadn\u2019t ever seemed to dry (a common New England affliction), and the decay of dead trees covered in the long forgotten, if ever remembered, words of dead men and women.\n\nHeaven.\n\nI\u2019d always had a romantic literary fantasy of swimming in books and devouring them one by one, day by day, in a beautiful library like this. My aunt even got me a membership. However, I must admit, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve stepped foot in Redwood since that day. (Instead, I could always be found sweaty and blissful hunched over on those clover leaf-shaped stools reading some fantasy or young adult novel that grabbed my eye at the public library after basketball practice and in between games at the Newport Rec Center just across the parking lot.)\n\nBut my obsession with libraries of great beauty and their collections has never waned. A magnificent library is a space that combines two forces (beauty and knowledge) to truly inspire awe in a way few places can. Two other edifices that come to mind are houses of worship (beauty and faith) and government buildings (beauty and power). Indeed, in any city anywhere, libraries, churches, and government buildings are usually the most visited sights.\n\nIt\u2019s why I\u2019m ecstatic we\u2019re going to give our readers a rich dive with a new series: The World\u2019s Most Beautiful Libraries. There are plenty of listicles around the internet, but once a month we\u2019re going to give you a full look at each of these iconic places. Some will be grand old things \u00e0 la Beauty & the Beast, and some sleek and modern. Some you may know, others will have escaped your notice. Our hope, though, is to give these places that hold so many of our shared stories, well, a better story of their own. And there are few libraries in the world (or spaces period) more beautiful than the Real Gabinete Portugu\u00eas de Leitura in the center of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn the heart of old Rio, across from a small plaza used as a parking lot, sits a charming but restrained Neo-Manueline building one could mistake for a neighborhood church or school. Most of its facade is smooth limestone, and unlike many of its neighbors, free from graffiti. The only ornamentation hinting at the splendor inside can be found on finials, around the gothic windows and doorways, and along the roofline. In relatively demure lettering across the top of the center of the building is written: Real Gabinete Portuguez de Leitura.\n\nBut inside, after passing under a lunette of elegant curling iron vines and through a vestibule floored with sumptuous tiles, one enters the library. After I remember to breathe, the first word that comes to mind is divine. Rising from a floor of giant white marble diamond tiles outlined in black marble are ornate dark wood galleries of bookcases accented with gold. These then stretch upward into a blind arcade gallery of sorts of gold and dark pine green Gothic arches. If you hadn\u2019t gotten the Gothic message, a gargantuan wrought-iron chandelier dangles in the middle of it all. And yet despite being a neo-Gothic library of dark wood and dark green, the space is far from somber and stuffy. That chandelier, in fact, isn\u2019t often turned on as the whole reading room is flooded with natural light pouring down from a glass dome crowning the space. Indeed, the whole space with its ornamentation and pointed, tine-like arches has the feel of a crown turned into a library.\n\nBut in a country best known for 20th century architecture from the likes of Oscar Niemeyer, one could be forgiven for asking, what in the hell is such a lavish Old World library doing in the heart of this tropical party city?\n\nOne could start by laying the various events that led to the Portuguese royal family of Braganza ruling the Empire of Brazil from Rio de Janeiro at the feet of Napoleon, who in just a decade upended so much of the European order. But the weakened state of Portugal (relegated to a bitterly clingy ally of the U.K.) goes back to 1755 and a massive earthquake that destroyed much of Lisbon and wiped out a large part of the resurgent kingdom\u2019s fortune. In the ensuing decades, Portugal\u2019s struggle to defend its far-reaching empire became ever more strained, and even its own home territory became at risk due to Napoleon and one colossally bad marriage. (The king at the center of this tale, Jo\u00e3o VI, married Princess Carlota Joaquina of Spain who spent much of their marriage plotting against her own husband on behalf of her native Spain. It is believed he may have died from arsenic poisoning.)\n\nIn the fall of 1807, with Napoleon\u2019s forces about to take Lisbon, the Portuguese royal family and as many of their retinue who could make the scramble piled into ships waiting in the pouring rain. The clock on the king\u2019s game of feigned appeasement to Napoleon had run out, and so, incredibly, the entire court of one of Europe\u2019s most storied kingdoms decamped to the New World, where the Portuguese Empire would be ruled from Rio de Janeiro. It meant a dramatic transformation for colonial Rio\u2014architecturally, culturally, and politically.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Beast Travel Digest Get the entire world in your inbox.

But the post-Napoleon situation in Portugal was a mess. First, Jo\u00e3o had actually only been ruling in his mother\u2019s name \u2014she\u2019d been declared mentally unfit\u2014 until she died in 1816. The king himself did not return to Portugal until 1821 due to conflicts there over what type of monarchy should be re-established after Napoleon. Not long after his return, the Portuguese empire had another shock \u2014the son Jo\u00e3o had left behind to govern Brazil had sided with Brazilian independence and declared it its own country.\n\nWhile the Braganza dynasty would rule Brazil until 1889, a period that with the usual caveats (slavery being a big one until the emperor abolished it) was a relative golden age of stability and military victories for Brazil compared to its neighbors. But events back in Portugal were chaotic, and that country\u2019s messy politics is in fact the reason we have this jewel of a library in Brazil today.\n\nJo\u00e3o VI\u2019s return to Portugal did little to bring stability. For the remainder of his rule and in the ensuing decades, Portugal, like Spain, was ripped apart by conflict between progressive reformers and those who believed in an absolute monarchy. Upon his death, the former supported his son Pedro, who had declared Brazil\u2019s independence but then came back to rule Portugal.\n\nThe absolutists, however, supported his other son, Miguel, who ruled Portugal in the early 1830s and jailed, tortured, and executed many of those seeking political freedoms. As a result, a number of political refugees fled to Rio de Janeiro, now ruled by Pedro\u2019s son Pedro II.\n\nOn May 14, 1837, a group of 42 Portuguese immigrants gathered at the house of one of those refugees in Rio de Janeiro. They were a mix of businessmen, lawyers, and intellectuals\u2014but all were products of a generation where the pursuit of knowledge was essential and all were passionate about their mother tongue. Like many of their contemporaries in France, Britain, and the U.S., they were confronted with the issue of a thirst for knowledge by an expanding middle class frustrated by the high cost of books. A solution already existed in those places. In France, it was called a cabinet de lecture, and in Britain and the U.S., subscription and circulating libraries. In essence, for a fee, you could borrow books or periodicals (as subscriptions to these were also expensive). The two most famous in America were Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Library Company of Philadelphia (1731), and, you guessed it, Redwood Library in Newport (1747).\n\nSo, these ardent book lovers created their own subscription library, a Gabinete Portugu\u00eas de Leitura (the Real, or Royal, was added later). Unlike a lot of other subscription libraries, however, there was no plan for the library to turn a profit. Jos\u00e9 Marcelino da Rocha Cabral, the first president of the association and a man who had spent time in the prisons of King Miguel, declared that the group\u2019s mission would reflect the idea that \u201cin no other respect have [we] obtained such advantageous results for the happiness of men and the glory of nations as in their application to the progress of literature and science, for the betterment of mankind.\u201d Besides general enlightenment, it would, the group promised, according to Antonio Alves-Caetano\u2019s O Real Gabinete Portugu\u00eas de Leitura do Rio de Janeiro, \u201chelp restore the literary glory of their fatherland.\u201d\n\nOver the decades, the members would amass such a collection of books (novels, histories, scientific, religious, and business texts eventually composing the largest collection of Portuguese works outside of Portugal) that new headquarters were always needed. In the 1860s, the members finally got serious about the need for a permanent space that matched the loftiness of their ambitions. But it would be another two decades before anything really happened.\n\nI felt sick. Gluttonous as always, I\u2019d stuffed myself to the edge of nausea with the perfect yellow custard treats covered in powdered sugar found in Belem, this now famous former suburb of Lisbon. Few destinations around the world have exploded in popularity like Lisbon. Nursing a stomach ache, I was headed to this uber-popular city\u2019s most famous sight and one of the few glimpses of the glory that existed prior to the earthquake\u2014Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery.\n\nWhat pictures don\u2019t quite capture about this space is its scale\u2014from outside it towers above and extends into the distance for what seems an eternity. Inside, the church\u2019s spindly columns shoot up into spider-webs of vaulting that mesmerize.\n\nThe cloisters that wind their way around green courtyards are of such beauty one almost could consider taking up the robe. It is the greatest example of Manueline architecture\u2014the ornate and imaginatively decorative late Portuguese Gothic style that so able blended a panoply of influences.\n\nAnd in the late 19th century it was in ruins due to neglect.\n\nThe architect tasked with its restoration, Rafael da Silva Castro, was asked by the Rio\u2019s library members to design their new building in the early 1870s. While that may seem an obvious choice, given the prominence of Jer\u00f3nimos, it was also another example of how much these members were focused on the motherland.\n\nAfter the dominance of neoclassical architecture in the 18th and early 19th century, a longing for an \u201cauthentic\u201d national architecture turned what was once a century-old fascination with medieval gothic style into a full blown architectural and decorative movement. In France, the most significant moment in this period was likely when Napoleon III tasked Viollet-le-Duc (designer of Notre Dame\u2019s restored but now incinerated spire) with rescuing the monumental Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds. In Germany, the Cologne Cathedral was finally completed and Ludwig II created Neuschwanstein, his medieval Sleeping Beauty castle. Britain was even earlier with icons like Strawberry Hill House.\n\nIn Portugal, the style was called neo-Manueline, and birthed such beauties as the Quinta da Regaleira, Bu\u00e7aco Palace Hotel, and Rossio train station. Of course the members of a library dedicated in part to promoting the legacy of Portugal would be fans of such a style, and commission a building that today is held up as one of its best examples. For inspiration, Cabral wrote, it should \u201cfollow the architecture of the Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery.\u201d Even the limestone cladding the building would be shipped from Portugal.\n\nIn 1880, the tercentenary of the death of Lu\u00eds Vaz de Cam\u00f5es, Portugal\u2019s greatest poet, construction began on the library with Emperor Pedro II looking on. For those who want to try to figure out the utterly perplexing old Brazilian way of writing out numbers, it cost 6:000$000 reais (or six contos de reais). The architect in Brazil who made Cabral\u2019s designs happen was Frederico Jose Branco.\n\nOn September 10, 1887, the building was finished. A year and two months later, on December 22, 1888, all 120,000 volumes in the collection had been installed and the library was officially complete. On both dates the building was inaugurated by the writer Joaquim Nabuco, one of Brazil\u2019s most famous writers and one of its loudest voices advocating for abolition of slavery.\n\nOn the building\u2019s street-facing facade are four niches, each containing a statue of one of Portugal\u2019s most illustrious figures. Three were explorers and conquerors: Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral, Infante D. Henrique (Prince Henry the Navigator), and Vasco da Gama. The fourth was Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es himself. Over the decades, the collection grew to the point it is at today, with over 400,000 volumes. In addition to priceless books (like a first edition of Cam\u00f5es\u2019 Os Lusiadas), the library is also a repository for gorgeous items like an ornately carved dark wood ciborium (miniature canopy on pillars used to house a precious object) and elaborate works of silver.\n\nBest of all? This library that makes so many of the must-see lists around the web (and even Massimo Listri\u2019s book on beautiful libraries) is open to the public, and anybody can go in, register, settle into one of the marvelous embossed black leather chairs, and read the books in their collection.\n\nHopefully, you\u2019ll be more successful than I was all those years ago in Redwood.", "description": "Built by immigrants bent on promoting their mother country, this month\u2019s dive into one of the world\u2019s most awe-inducing spaces focuses on a jewel of library architecture in Brazil.", "authors": ["William O Connor", "Travel Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571435772/191018-oconnor-_Libraries-tease_bvwmgc", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
