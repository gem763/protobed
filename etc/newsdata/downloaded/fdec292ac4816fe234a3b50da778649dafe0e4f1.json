The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.8%, led by equities in Germany.\n\nThe relatively muted optimism in markets reflect investors' wait-and-watch approach as they await new inflation data from the U.S. and the European Central Bank's account of its own latest meeting, both scheduled to be released on Thursday, said Oliver Jones, market economist at Capital Economics.\n\n\"People are waiting for headline events later this week,\" Mr. Jones said. \"It's a bit of quiet before movement later in the week.\"\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.6% as data on machine-tool orders confirmed a bleak picture for the country's manufacturing sector.\n\nThe \"numbers remain abysmal,\" analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note. \"The absence of any hints of a sustainable recovery suggests that industrial production in Japan, and output globally, looks set to stay subdued in year-on-year terms,\" they said.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.8% amid tensions over protests in the city.
