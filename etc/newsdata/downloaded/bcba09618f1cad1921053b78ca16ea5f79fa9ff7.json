New York also moved a step closer to claiming the AL East with another victory over the rival Red Sox, whose string of three straight division titles is coming to an end.\n\nThe Yankees entered the game two homers shy of the club record of 267, set last year. Torres\u2019 two-run shot in the second was No. 266, Tauchman went deep with a man on in the fourth and Judge added the record-breaker by leading off the fifth with his 21st of the season.\n\nTorres went 3 for 5 with four RBIs. His 35th homer moved him one ahead of Gary S\u00e1nchez for the club lead.\n\nJackie Bradley Jr. and Mookie Betts homered for the Red Sox, who lost for the third time in four games. Boston fell eight games behind Oakland for the second AL wild-card spot with only 19 games remaining.\n\nChad Green (3-4) pitched three perfect innings of relief for New York and got the victory. Rick Porcello (12-12) lasted just four innings for Boston, which used eight pitchers before it was finally over.\n\nThe only low point for the Yankees on Sunday was losing Tauchman in the fourth inning when he came up limping while fielding a routine single. Tauchman left with tightness in his left calf.\n\nPorcello got the Yankees in order in the first, but the game unraveled quickly from there for the Red Sox. New York scored a pair of runs in each of the next four innings and the Red Sox never recovered.\n\nAfter Bradley pulled Boston within 4-2 on a two-run homer in the third, Torres led off the fourth with a single and scored on Tauchman\u2019s homer to right.\n\nPorcello allowed six runs on seven hits. Ryan Brasier took over in the fifth and Judge jumped on the second pitch he saw for a homer to left that put the Yankees up 7-4.\n\nMasahiro Tanaka went four innings for the Yankees, allowing four runs on eight hits and striking out one. He was replaced in the fifth by Green, who struck out five and did not allow a baserunner in his three innings of work.\n\nFRIENDLY FAREWELL\n\nThe Red Sox honored Yankees lefty CC Sabathia before the game with a No. 52 from Fenway Park\u2019s iconic left-field scoreboard. Sabathia, who is on the injured list with inflammation in his right knee, received a standing ovation from the Fenway fans and players from both clubs after Red Sox lefty David Price presented him with the green placard.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nYankees: Tauchman was scheduled to return to New York for evaluation on Monday. . RHP Luis Severino (right shoulder rotator cuff inflammation, lat injury) will make another rehab start for Double-A Trenton on Wednesday and probably return to the Yankees after that, manager Aaron Boone said. . Sabathia will do some light throwing Monday and is scheduled to start Wednesday at Detroit. . OF Aaron Hicks (right flexor strain) will get a second opinion Monday after having a setback in his rehab, Boone said. . New York reinstated 3B Gio Urshela (left groin) and IF Thairo Estrada (right hamstring) from the injured list and recalled C Kyle Higashioka and IF Brevic Valera from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.\n\nRed Sox: Price (cyst left wrist) will not pitch when Boston visits Toronto for three games Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, manager Alex Cora said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees LHP James Paxton (12-6, 4.16 ERA) faces LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (17-5, 3.81) for the Red Sox on Monday night in the finale of the four-game series.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gleyber Torres, Mike Tauchman, Aaron Judge hit home runs as the New York Yankees broke the franchise record for homers in a season Sunday night in a 10-5 win over the Red Sox.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Alden"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/yankees_red_sox_baseball_42765_c0-88-2100-1312_s1770x1032.jpg?30dd1078ff68c7666153ff7c17bf3b0bdf3ea7ae", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
