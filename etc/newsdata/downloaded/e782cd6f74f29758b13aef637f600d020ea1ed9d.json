USA TODAY\n\nEllen DeGeneres is leveling the playing field.\n\nEagle-eyed fans spotted the comedian sitting next to former President George W. Bush during Sunday's matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe unlikely duo had many fans throwing a flag on the play. \"Ellen, this isn\u2019t just a simple difference of opinion. George Bush, his administration, and his colleagues actively discriminated and worked against the LGBT community,\" one Twitter user wrote, while another added, \"Really, really low standards there Ellen, and pretty pathetic.\"\n\nDeGeneres made light of the situation on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" Tuesday, calling for more tolerance and kindness while sharing \"the whole story\" with her viewers.\n\n\"During the game, they showed a shot of me and George laughing together. And so, people were upset,\" DeGeneres said. \"They thought, 'Why is this gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?' \"\n\n'This is what the world needs': Ellen DeGeneres meets hugging toddlers from viral video\n\nLaura & George Bush sitting with Ellen Degeneres and Portia de Rossi is not something I expected to see at an NFL game pic.twitter.com/AbWbhXd3RC \u2014 Paid man gets bored (@cjzero) October 6, 2019\n\n\"Here\u2019s the thing,\" she added. \"I\u2019m friends with George Bush. In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. We\u2019re all different and I think that we've forgotten that that\u2019s OK.\"\n\nDeGeneres continued: \"When I say 'be kind to one another,' I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter.\"\n\nDuring warm-ups before the Packers/Cowboys game Sunday, Ellen DeGeneres was on the field. (Photo: Ron Jenkins, AP)\n\nShe explained that Charlotte Jones, the daughter of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, invited her and wife Portia de Rossi to sit in Jones' \"fancy\" suite at AT&T Stadium.\n\nThey, of course, accepted because \"we wanted to keep up with the Joneses,\" DeGeneres quipped.\n\nShe said Jones' \"very fancy suite\" came with \"fancy friends,\" including Bush and former first lady Laura Bush. DeGeneres said they all had \"so much fun\" that afternoon despite their differences of opinions \u2026 on football that is.\n\n\"When we were invited I was aware that I was going to be surrounded by people with very different views and beliefs. And I'm not talking about politics. I was rooting for the Packers,\" she joked, adding that she hide her Cheesehead Hat in her wife's purse.\n\nDeGeneres concluded her message by reminding Bush: \"You owe me $6 for the nachos.\"\n\nYes, that was me at the Cowboys game with George W. Bush over the weekend.
