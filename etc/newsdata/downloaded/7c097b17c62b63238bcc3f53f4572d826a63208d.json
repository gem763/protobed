What is perhaps the most frightening aspect of the holiday, however, is the amount of food waste accumulated as a result of pumpkin carving.\n\nYes, it sounds dramatic but the figures are this: a shocking 8 million pumpkins have been sentenced to landfill this year, \u201cthe equivalent of enough pumpkin pie to feed the entire nation\u201d estimates The Guardian.\n\nAccording to an investigation by environmental charity Hubbub, 40% of consumers purchase pumpkins to carve for Halloween, and 60% of that number admit they dispose of the inner flesh. Meanwhile, 80% said they don\u2019t consider pumpkins\u2019 primary purpose as a food item.\n\nSo what IS being done to rescue the pumpkins this Halloween?\n\nPutting its foot down to unnecessary food waste, Hubbub has organised its #PumpkinRescue campaign to raise awareness awareness of the sheer volume of edible food that ends up in the bin. Suggesting ways to put a stop to the festivity\u2019s wasteful excesses, it recommends pumpkin rescue events \u201cnear you\u201d so you can do your bit.\n\nThe absurdity of carving a fruit (yes, pumpkin is a fruit) into a holiday accessory and ignoring the edible innards has struck a chord with celebrity chefs and food waste activists like Mark Hix, Tom Hunt and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. These chefs, alongside wholesome fast food joint Leon have devised a menu of recipes created whet your appetite and encourage people to put the inside of their pumpkins to good use.\n\nAlso hoping to alleviate the collosal pile of holiday waste is Toast Ale, a social enterprise known for launching a beer made from bread waste in 2016. Pioneering the UK\u2019s first pumpkin brew, Toast Ale will be creating a Belgian-style beer harvested from local farms by volunteers, ready in time to stock your fridge in November.\n\nMeanwhile Oddbox takes the \u201cwonky\u201d,\u201cweird\u201d and \u201ckind of ugly\u201d fruit and veg that doesn\u2019t fulfill the standard appearance criteria of supermarket produce. It estimates 7.2% of harvested food ends up as animal feed or in landfill due to imperfections. Though there is little data on pumpkins alone, due to the fluctuating demand, one can only predict that there\u2019s even more pumpkins than other fruits and veggies to be rescued from an early grave. Last year Oddbox saved 1,800 pumpkins and helped them reach our kitchen tables and this year they aim to prevent a staggering 7,000 pumpkins from going to waste.\n\nRead more | My eco job saving ugly fruit and veg from the bin\n\nOur cosmetic solutions to the pumpkin crisis\n\nPumpkins are known for having a whole wealth of health benefits; both internally and externally.
