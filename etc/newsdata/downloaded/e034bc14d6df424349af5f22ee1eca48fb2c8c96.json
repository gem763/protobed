But even by their own partisan standards, House Democrats have already found new ways to lower the bar,\" McConnell added.\n\nMcConnell's comments come as House Democrats are holding near daily closed-door interviews with current and former administration officials as they dig into Trump's effort to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenSupport drops for Medicare for All but increases for public option Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump and his allies have lashed out at the investigation and argued that House Democrats must hold a public vote to formally launch an inquiry.

He's remained largely silent on Trump's remarks since before Congress's two-week break.\n\nBut he lashed out at Democrats on Tuesday, saying they had \"wasted no time throwing fairness and precedent to the wind.\"\n\n\"For all the public hyperventilating over institutional norms that we've heard from House Democrats, it appears they have no intention of letting norms, precedents or basic due process stand in the way as they seek to cancel out a presidency,\" McConnell added.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) teed off against the House impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, marking his first comments since Congress returned from its two-week break.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mcconnellmitch_092519gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
