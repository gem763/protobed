Another dubbed him \"Caesar\", as The Australian Financial Review revealed this week.\n\nSome MPs have noted Morrison adopting a dismissive approach to backbenchers in the party room when they ask questions or offer suggestions.\n\nThey fear Morrison's arrogance, a trait he managed to keep in check on the campaign trail, is bubbling back to the surface.\n\n\"There is a stridency now about his actions,\" one MP observes.\n\n\"He thinks he doesn't need anyone because he won the election everyone felt we were going to lose.\"\n\nThis MP highlights Morrison's dodging of questions over whether he sought an invitation for his friend, controversial Hillsong Pastor Brian Houston, to attend the White House State Dinner as an Achilles heel. \"He doesn't understand the spin of one day can become a rod for your back the next\".\n\nThe evasiveness and unwillingness to cop any criticism is fast becoming a hallmark of Morrison's administration.\n\nMinisters and bureaucrats ducked questions at Senate estimates by taking them on notice at a rapid rate and while it attracted little attention, the government installed newly appointed Victorian Senator Sarah Henderson as chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder former chair Ian Goodenough, the committee - which scrutinises legislation for compliance with human rights obligations - last month released a report critical of the government's repeal of the so-called \"medevac\" laws to transfer asylum seekers for treatment.\n\nBut as the ABC reported, Morrison has now appointed a public critic of the medevac laws to chair the committee.\n\nNon-government MPs on the committee told AFR Weekend Henderson's appointment was a \"total ambush\" and worry it is another sign of Morrison's \"my way or the highway\" approach to politics.\n\nHowever, other government MPs are more charitable in their assessment of Morrison.\n\nOne supporter says the party room is the calmest it has been in their time in Parliament.\n\n\"It is a different tempo. Under Malcolm [Turnbull] backbenchers were rallying to fight a cause, often in opposition to him. That is not happening any more,\" this MP says.\n\n\"Everyone is talking about the PM being a six-year PM. Sometimes he can be direct, maybe even a bit abrasive but at least you know what his position is.\"\n\nAnother offers a sanguine view in response to criticism the government lacks an agenda, saying a series of policy \"deep dives\" are being undertaken which will bear fruit in coming months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of that, Morrison has invited small groups of backbenchers \u2013 about half-a-dozen or so, who are interested or experts in that particular policy area \u2013 to participate alongside ministerial staffers and bureaucrats in developing initiatives.\n\n\"This kind of process means policies should be uncontentious by the time they hit the party room,\" this MP says.\n\nOn the policy front, Morrison has some rocky shoals to navigate. Ministers are stubbornly insisting on returning the budget to surplus, hence the reluctance to open the purse strings and boost the economy.\n\nReligious freedom will drag into next year and likely require some changes to satisfy churches.\n\nBut the biggest immediate challenge is the drought response. And while it is crippling the bush, Liberals are reporting a backlash from urban voters.\n\n\"People in the cities are sceptical about whether the government is doing enough to address drought,\" an MP says.\n\nThe drought and rural policy more generally is causing tensions within the Coalition, with National Party anger erupting spectacularly this week.\n\nThe initial catalyst was dairy, with Queensland MP Llew O'Brien reportedly threatening on Monday to spill the position of deputy leader. Agriculture Minister Bridget McKenzie came under pressure from Pauline Hanson after she brought forward a dairy industry code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce leaked the Nationals own $1.3 billion drought plan, warning the Coalition would lose the election if it did not do more to support the bush.\n\nIn both cases, Nationals believed they were not getting enough credit for their work. \"How can you keep doing deals with One Nation and screwing your own side over,\" one MP asks in frustration.\n\nSome in the Nationals point to a wider malaise over the leadership of Michael McCormack and a feeling the party was not extracting enough from Morrison.\n\n\"There are people worried Morrison is steamrolling him. We don't know what we could be getting,\" the MP says.\n\nThese strains over drought policy were fodder for Labor in question time this week and came on top of a fresh controversey for Energy Minister Angus Taylor.\n\nMany in the opposition ranks are looking to a major speech Anthony Albanese will give in Perth on Tuesday focused on jobs and the future of work, together with the conclusion of the campaign review 10 days later, as the chance for the party to rule a line under its election defeat.\n\nAlbanese heads west with a win under his belt after militant union leader John Setka abandoned his fight to stay in the Labor Party.\n\n\"Our first job was to survive until the review. We're at that point in time where we need to start sketching out our agenda,\" one Labor Left MP says, adding that opinion polls show the party is competitive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven so, there is a bit of grumbling that Albanese's inner circle is pretty limited - Tony Burke from the NSW Right and left-wing frontbenchers Mark Butler, Terri Butler and Penny Wong are seen as his closest party room lieutenants. At the same time, a fight with unions about free trade agreements and squabbling over climate targets are complicating policy positions.\n\nOne frontbencher says debate about what policies to keep, modify or dump has enlivened discussion but is necessary if Albanese is to succeed in dragging Labor back to the centre ground.\n\n\"I think it has been useful. I don't know if Albo sees it helping him but it does,\" the frontbencher says.\n\n\"Being pulled by the Left, he really needs the Right of the party to be the bad guys to give him the cover he needs.\"\n\nBut some are sceptical Albanese's Perth speech, which will be the first of a series to articulate values, will actually cut through to voters.\n\n\"No one is paying attention to us except when we piss people off,\" one long-time parliamentarian says.\n\nThis MP argues Albanese \"needs to lift his game\" with his leadership and that more consistency was needed.\n\n\"It's not easy and I think he is learning how hard it is,\" the MP says.\n\n\"There are green shoots for us in small ways but in a very scorched earth.\"", "description": "Scott Morrison is giving pep talks to keep his troops motivated while Anthony Albanese is angling for a Labor reset.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2958%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_225%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c3ca82258250d13f9c8f32e06d73e70e25d2e5af", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
