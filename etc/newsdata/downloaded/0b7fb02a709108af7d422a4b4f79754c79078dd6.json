The sub-components include the children in care and portals as a product, ADHA said.\n\nOther vendors currently contracted by the agency are: Adobe Systems, Converging Data, Oracle Australia, NTT COM ICT Solutions Australia, Datacom Systems, Chamonix IT Management Consulting, PWC, and Thinkplace Australia.\n\nThe RFI closes 3 December 2019.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "The government agency has its eyes on a future that includes AI, blockchain, and IoT.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/11/20/c07e3441-1d39-47cb-905f-a49451f75e59/thumbnail/770x578/c045139a838caf96497b9d604c37906b/healthcare.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
