Mr Jones\u2019 glass storefront plaque also remains with the house.\n\nThe home passed through two more families before landing with the Hartleys, who undertook significant restoration work and renovations, working with the Brisbane City Architecture and Heritage Team and award-winning builder Corella Construction.\n\nThe heritage listed house was raised, built-in underneath and completely restored.\n\n\u201cThe amount of time, energy and passion that went into this renovation, not only from our family but also our builders and trades, is evident in the finished product,\u201d Mrs Hartley said.\n\n\u201cIt is a true home, it\u2019s not just a house.\u201d\n\nToday in the original upstairs space there is a front veranda, formal lounge and dining rooms and a galley-style kitchen opening to a rear deck, along with a bathroom, sitting room, master suite with dressing room and ensuite, and second bedroom.\n\nA standout feature is the functional two-storey, double sided chimney with fireplace in the formal living room, a hearth for the cooker in the original kitchen and brick support column on the lower level.\n\nMrs Hartley said lower level of the chimney once had a fire pit with a copper pot sitting above for boiling laundry.\n\n\u201cWe still have that copper pot \u2014 it\u2019s been full restored,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd that is just the start of the restoration work done over a period of seven months, which followed eight months of planning.\n\n\u201cUpstairs the pressed metal cornices were restored, all the decking needed to be replaced and the original glass and crystal chandeliers all had to be restored,\u201d Mrs Hartley said.\n\n\u201cA lot of paint had to come off, layers and layers of it.\n\n\u201cThe breeze windows had all been painted closed so a lot of work went into them. My husband restored the original mechanisms that open and close the windows.\n\n\u201cThe old gas light fittings have also been restored and they are still on the walls.\u201d\n\nThe 1960s-era kitchen and bathroom were replaced with more traditional spaces but the original claw foot bathtub still takes pride of place in the bathroom.\n\n\u201cThe kitchen is the hub of the home,\u201d Mrs Hartley said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful space opening to the deck. It has a 3m long Caesarstone bench with seating all the way around that takes in the city from the lights of the Gabba to the second arch of the Story Bridge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the place we find ourselves most often.\u201d\n\nMrs Hartley said early on in the restoration process they discovered a storage area with terrazzo flooring on the back veranda was once a bathroom, so they got permission to convert the space into an ensuite for the master bedroom.\n\nThe new area downstairs houses a wine cellar, second kitchen, games lounge, bathroom, laundry and three covered patios. There are also three more bedrooms, with ensuites, walk-in wardrobes and study nooks to two.\n\n\u201cDownstairs is clearly a new addition but it is in keeping with the grandeur of the house,\u201d Mrs Hartley said.\n\nThe property also has a saltwater swimming pool with pavilion, manicured gardens, fire pit and a six-car garage.\n\n\u201cWe created all the landscaping. When we bought the house (the yard) was an overgrown mess of shrubs and vines,\u201d Mrs Hartley said.\n\nBut after restoring the heritage Queenslander and creating a beautiful family home, Mrs Hartley and her husband have decided to sell the now 2025sq m property.\n\n\u201cWe thought it was going to be our forever home but we\u2019ve found another one,\u201d she said.\n\nThe property is being marketed by Joanna Gianniotis of Place Bulimba will be auctioned on Thursday, November 7.\n\nRenovation Facts\n\nBudget: $1.5 million\n\nTime: 15 months", "description": "After a decade of dreaming, eight months of planning and seven months of restorations and renovations, the owners of this 1909 Queenslander have created a family home full of character.", "authors": ["Courtney Todd"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/28060102/capi_195548bc5dd2cfa77cbcc2b9c032ec3f_f8620ee8f0c75b835d635e337d2adbab.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
