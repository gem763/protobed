(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nWhen President Trump and Narendra Modi met last month in France, their camaraderie was on full display as they smiled, laughed and even clasped hands in front of reporters. Now the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest democracies are taking their relationship to the next level: On Sunday, they will appear together at a rally in Houston in front of tens of thousands of people.\n\nFor the Indian government, Trump\u2019s presence at the rally is a diplomatic triumph. It marks the first time that any U.S. president and Indian prime minister have addressed such an event together, and it comes at a critical juncture.\n\nIn recent months, the United States and India have become embroiled in a trade war, and Trump has complained vociferously about Indian tariffs, even as he has touted his personal rapport with Modi.\n\nIndia, meanwhile, has faced criticism for its recent moves to strip Kashmir of its autonomy and institute a communications crackdown in the restive Muslim-majority region. The steps sparked tensions with Pakistan and expressions of concern from the State Department and some members of Congress, who have urged India to end its detentions of Kashmir\u2019s political leaders.\n\n[Locked up and shut down: How India has silenced opposition to its crackdown in Kashmir]\n\nNow, with Modi and Trump sharing a stage, the two countries will emphasize their affinities rather than their differences. Modi\u2019s supporters can point to Trump\u2019s presence at the rally as \u201cvirtual approval of what [Modi] has done\u201d in Kashmir, said Varghese George, the author of a new book on India-U.S. relations. It\u2019s \u201ca very big deal for Modi and his politics.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump meets Modi during the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, on Aug. 26. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nModi entered office in 2014 and recently won a landslide reelection victory. Like Trump, he has motivated voters with promises to safeguard the nation and restore its greatness. Modi\u2019s brand of politics also views India as fundamentally Hindu, rather than a secular republic as envisaged by its founders.\n\nModi is very popular at home \u2014 his approval ratings far outstrip Trump\u2019s \u2014 and he draws large audiences from the Indian diaspora when he travels abroad. About 50,000 people are expected at the rally at Houston\u2019s NRG Stadium, an event aptly titled \u201cHowdy, Modi!\u201d Hundreds of Indian American groups have helped boost attendance.\n\nMilan Vaishnav, who heads the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he could not remember a time when an American president was the guest at a rally for a foreign leader on U.S. soil. \u201cWe have to acknowledge what a spectacle this is,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than maybe the pope, it\u2019s hard to think of this kind of setting happening before.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s presence at the event is a \u201crecognition of the importance of the Indian diaspora in the U.S.\u201d and \u201cdefinitely a recognition of Prime Minister Modi as a global leader,\u201d said Vijay Chauthaiwale, who heads foreign affairs and overseas outreach for India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nThe U.S.-India relationship is anchored by shared strategic interests, added Chauthaiwale. \u201cThere will be some differences of opinion on certain issues, maybe on trade or maybe even our move in Kashmir,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is enough maturity to deal with it in a friendly manner.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, the rally provides access to a pool of voters \u2014 Indian Americans \u2014 that he hopes to court in next year\u2019s presidential elections, even if the community tends to lean heavily Democratic.\n\nOfficials from both countries have dropped strong hints that they hope to announce progress toward reducing the current trade frictions while Modi is in the United States. If so, it would allow Trump to claim a victory on one of his signature issues.\n\nIndia\u2019s external affairs minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, told reporters Tuesday that he expected to see some of the \u201csharper edges\u201d in the U.S.-India relationship \u201caddressed in some form in the not-too-distant future.\u201d\n\nExperts said that they believed that any imminent trade agreement would probably be modest. On the trade front, the two countries are \u201ctrying to undo damage and stop new damage, rather than do exciting, positive things,\u201d said Richard M. Rossow, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cYou\u2019re at the hospital, not the gym.\u201d\n\nRossow said that India might make concessions on issues such as its price caps on certain medical devices and possibly ease import restrictions on some agricultural commodities. The United States, meanwhile, could indicate its openness to reinstating preferential treatment for certain Indian imports \u2014 a status Trump revoked in May.\n\nAfter appearing onstage with Trump, Modi will travel to New York for the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly. He is scheduled to deliver an address there Sept. 27, his first such appearance since 2014. He also will receive an award from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation honoring progress in global health for his \u201cClean India\u201d campaign that has constructed millions of toilets across the country.\n\nThe award from the foundation has become a focus for protesters seeking to draw attention to India\u2019s actions in Kashmir. They recently presented a petition with 100,000 signatures at the foundation\u2019s headquarters in Seattle urging it to retract the honor, which it declined to do.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s a big, complex case, and some of the recent things, I think, people are really questioning, rightly,\u201d Bill Gates said in an interview with The Washington Post\u2019s Ishaan Tharoor. But the award from the foundation is about India\u2019s work on sanitation, Gates said, which has helped combat diseases that kill hundreds of thousands of people a year. \u201cWe think the head of government that took these moves on sanitation, that\u2019s worthy of note.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nIn Modi\u2019s move on Kashmir, a road map for his \u2018new India\u2019\n\nIn world\u2019s biggest election, Narendra Modi pushes fear over hope\n\nAmong the 3,000 detained by Indian authorities in Kashmir: Children\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The president\u2019s presence at the event in Houston comes at a critical juncture.", "authors": ["Joanna Slater", "Foreign Correspondent Covering South Asia", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VmQtOs9jJzHPUh4qa9fpHNs8NYQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DPFXPZG2HUI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
