James Alcock\n\nBut speculation is rife that the Coalition will take a proposed freeze at 10 per cent to the next federal election by framing the remaining incremental rises to 12 per cent as an impediment to wage rises.\n\n\"We welcomed the previous delay in the increases and we believe any further increases should be considered very carefully in the context of the impact on jobs and economic growth,\u201d Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief economist Ross Lambie told The Australian Financial Review.\n\n\"It\u2019s important to remember that any increase in superannuation guarantee charge is effectively a pay rise funded by the employer.\n\n\u201cAny increase without a corresponding increase in productivity comes at significant cost to businesses, particularly small business.\u201d\n\nTen per cent a 'nice round number'\n\nThe Morrison government has appointed a three-member panel to establish \u201cfacts\u201d rather than make recommendations about the retirement income system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe review was a recommendation of the Productivity Commission, which identified unnecessary multiple accounts, high fees and poor performance as problems to be overcome before further increases in the super guarantee.\n\nAustralian Retailers Association executive director Russell Zimmerman says a slower climb to 12 per cent is worth thinking about. Louie Douvis\n\nAssistant Minister for Superannuation Jane Hume has described the government as having a \u201cmoral\u201d obligation to fix the system before moving to 12 per cent and believes 10 per cent is a \u201cnice round number\u201d.\n\nAustralianSuper is the nation\u2019s largest super fund. It has two shareholders: AiGroup and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which is wedded to the 12 per cent goal set by former prime minister Paul Keating.\n\nAustralianSuper chief executive Ian Silk pointed to Prime Minister Scott Morrison's comments about being committed to the legislated timetable for increases in the super guarantee.\n\n\u201cThe super guarantee is legislated,\" Mr Silk said. \"It's been twice delayed and people who don't like super can always find a reason for it to be further delayed.\"\n\nOther industry groups with shareholders in major industry funds such as Master Builders Australia, which has a 50 per cent stake in Cbus, and the Australian Hotels Association, which part owns Hostplus, did not respond to questions about whether further super guarantee rises are good for workers and the economy.\n\nThe retirement income inquiry is likely to consider research by the Grattan Institute, which found lifting the super guarantee to 12 per cent will erode wages without improving retirement incomes much for average workers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It\u2019s hard to think of a policy less in the interests of working Australians than higher compulsory super contributions,\" Grattan's Brendan Coates said in July.\n\nAMMA chief executive Steve Knott says his members are unperturbed about the super rise.\n\n\"Instead the big winners from higher compulsory super will be the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australian workers, who benefit from extra super tax breaks and are unlikely to receive the age pension anyway.\"\n\nRise factored in\n\nNearly 2 million workers already receive 12 per cent \u2013 sometimes more \u2013 including politicians, public sector employees and academics.\n\n\"We believe the review the government has announced is the right review because there are a range of issues that need proper ventilation,\" Mr Willox said.\n\n\"It's important that government not just make snap decisions which will impact on the livelihood of millions of Australians both now and in the future.\"\n\nViews from employers about going to 12 per cent appear to be split according to sector and size of the businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustralian Mines and Metals Association chief executive Steve Knott said his members \u2013 large companies that pay highly skilled workers comparatively big wages \u2013 were unperturbed about SG rises.\n\n\"The incremental increases to the superannuation guarantee rates between now and July 1, 2025, have well and truly been factored into the remuneration forecasting and planning for AMMA members for some years now,\" he said.\n\n\"The bigger issue over the next five to six years is the projected increase in the national mining workforce, including specific occupations where shortages may emerge.\"\n\nBut at the other end of the scale, small businesses say they are troubled by the prospect of higher employment costs.\n\nMalcolm Richards called for more flexibility in the timing of the increase. Tony Moore\n\nAustralian Retailers Association executive director Russell Zimmerman said 12 per cent was a worthy goal but the government should consider a slower climb to 12 per cent.\n\n\"Maybe it could be 0.25 every few years,\u201d he said.\n\n\"That might be a better way of doing it. We've seen too many retailers go to the wall and as much as it sounds like a cliche, things are fairly tough, and I think probably a hiatus on it for a while before it was implemented would be better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaster Electricians Australia chief executive Malcolm Richards said the rate should be flexible at between 10 per cent and 12 per cent.\n\nBusinesses that could afford to pay 12 per cent could position themselves as \"employers of choice\", he said.\n\n\"In many cases, young electrical apprentices are trying to set themselves up in life and may prefer to put the additional money towards a house deposit or other financial goals.\n\n\"If the increase is to proceed, we believe the burden should be shared equally between employers and employees, with half of the super contribution to be funded from scheduled wage increases.\"\n\nMr Richards called for more flexibility in the timing of the increase. \"Most employees in the electrical contracting sector are family businesses with just one or two external staff,\" he said.\n\n\"Higher contributions to superannuation for staff will need to come out of the pockets \u2013 and probably the retirement savings \u2013 of those families.\"\n\nDr Lambie said the double-whammy of another above-inflation award wage rise in the first half of 2020 plus higher compulsory super could be very bad for jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe superannuation discussion, including whether there is room for further delay, is best factored in as part of the comprehensive review of retirement incomes announced by the Treasurer to ensure people are going to be well catered for in their retirement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t look at the rate of superannuation guarantee charge in isolation.\n\n\"There\u2019s been a lot of focus from the banking royal commission that some superannuation funds haven\u2019t been serving members well.\n\n\"Just increasing the charge to 12 per cent doesn\u2019t necessarily mean workers will get the full benefit. Broader considerations need to be taken into account.\"", "description": "The nation's biggest employer groups are openly contemplating another freeze in the super guarantee following the appointment of an expert panel to review the retirement income system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2853%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_328/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/05af165762e6dbf75c68ab574d5b25a41742c32d", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
