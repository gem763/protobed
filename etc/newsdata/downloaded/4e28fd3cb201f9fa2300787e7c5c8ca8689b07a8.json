REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration\n\nThe survey showed that German private sector activity shrank for the first time in 6-1/2 years in September as a manufacturing recession deepened unexpectedly and growth in the service sector lost momentum.\n\n\u201cManufacturing is even worse than it was during the (2013) sovereign debt crisis,\u201d said Michael Hewson, CMC Markets\u2019 analyst. \u201cIt suggests that Germany is not going to grow at all in the second half of the year.\u201d\n\nBusiness growth across the region has also stalled this month, missing forecasts, another PMI survey showed.\n\nIncreasing talk of fiscal stimulus in the euro zone raised bond yields in the region last week, but many analysts say it is not enough to boost the single currency in the context of concerns about global trade and slowdown fears.\n\nHewson added that the weakening euro suggested investors did not think Germany - the euro zone\u2019s biggest economy - was moving towards a significant fiscal package. The European Central Bank has urged governments to focus on fiscal policy because the room for more monetary easing is limited.\n\nThe single currency, trading around $1.10 before the numbers were released, dropped 0.5% to as low as $1.0966, its weakest since Sept. 12.\n\nThe euro also slid versus the Swiss franc, losing 0.5% to as low as 1.0857 francs.\n\n\u201cThe ECB is being ignored for now and hence prospects of any near-term shift in policy do not look particularly realistic,\u201d MUFG analysts said. \u201cWe see little upside scope for EUR/USD here.\u201d\n\nEuro vs U.S. dollar: here\n\nThe dollar was boosted by the euro\u2019s decline, and its index - which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies - was last up 0.2% at 98.748 .DXY.\n\nThe dollar has held up well in recent months as investors are attracted to its relatively high yield and the strength of the U.S. economy.\n\nElsewhere, foreign exchange markets reflected fading optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal.\n\nBoth China and the United States published positive statements after the latest talks, with the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office describing the talks as \u201cproductive\u201d and China\u2019s Commerce Ministry calling them \u201cconstructive\u201d. October\u2019s high-level talks remain on track.\n\nBut the safe-haven Japanese yen reversed its earlier losses and was last up 0.1% at 107.41 as any optimism was overshadowed by worries about the health of the global economy.\n\nChina's offshore yuan dropped 0.1% to 7.1237 yuan CNH=EBS.\n\nSterling slipped 0.2% to $1.2442 GBP=D3 as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson cautioned that there would be no Brexit breakthrough at talks with European leaders in New York.", "description": "The euro fell on Monday after German flash purchasing managers' index survey data for September was weaker than expected, raising more fears about the health of the economy.", "authors": ["Tommy Wilkes", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432867413&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0FH", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
