The sounds had to be enhanced for humans to hear.\n\nInSight\u2019s seismometer has detected more than 100 events, but only 21 are considered strong marsquake candidates. The rest could be marsquakes - or something else. The French seismometer is so sensitive it can hear the Martian wind as well as movements by the lander\u2019s robot arm and other mechanical \u201cdinks and donks \u201d as the team calls them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been exciting, especially in the beginning, hearing the first vibrations from the lander,\u201d said Imperial College London\u2019s Constantinos Charalambous, who helped provide the audio recordings. \u201cYou\u2019re imagining what\u2019s really happening on Mars as InSight sits on the open landscape,\u201d he added in a statement.\n\nInSight arrived at Mars last November and recorded its first seismic rumbling in April.\n\nA German drilling instrument, meanwhile, has been inactive for months. Scientists are trying to salvage the experiment to measure the planet\u2019s internal temperature.\n\nThe so-called mole is meant to penetrate 16 feet (5 meters) beneath the Martian surface, but has managed barely 1 foot (30 centimeters). Researchers suspect the Martian sand isn\u2019t providing the necessary friction for digging, causing the mole to helplessly bounce around rather than burrow deeper, and to form a wide pit around itself.\n\n\u2022 The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
