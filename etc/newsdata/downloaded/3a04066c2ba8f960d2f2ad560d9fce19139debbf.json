But in countries where there hasn\u2019t been pressure, they have failed to add the same transparency efforts.\n\nFacebook provides political ad transparency in 35 countries, Privacy International said. Google provides it in 30 countries. Twitter provides it in 32 countries, but only for specific elections; other political ads on Twitter outside the U.S. are treated as promoted tweets.\n\nBut none of the companies provide \u201cmeaningful transparency into political issue ads,\u201d the group said in its report, noting that Facebook and Twitter each define them differently. Google has not even defined what it considers to be \u201cpolitical issues,\u201d the group added.\n\nSocial media companies have been facing pressure to increase political advertising transparency in the U.S. since officials found that Russia had orchestrated a widespread online misinformation campaign during the 2016 election. In Europe, leaders have also been targeting big tech companies over privacy issues for several years.\n\nRepresentatives from Facebook and Google both told FOX Business that their respective companies have worked to increase transparency into political advertising.\n\n\u201cPolitical advertising on Facebook and Instagram is now far more transparent than anywhere else, especially when compared to TV, radio and print advertising,\u201d the Facebook spokesperson said.\n\nFacebook has also been removing millions of fake accounts and \u201cclamping down on fake news,\u201d according to the spokesperson. They said the company has been working with governments, watchdogs, regulators and others to bring transparency to ads and keep advertisers and Facebook itself accountable.\n\nFacebook has posted an \u201cad library\u201d and Google has posted a \u201ctransparency report\u201d to make political advertising information public.\n\n\u201cFor many years, we\u2019ve provided a range of products and programs to protect the integrity of elections and help voters find quality information about their elections,\u201d a Google spokesperson said. \u201cRecently, we\u2019ve also built tools to help people understand who\u2019s paying for political ads they see. We know there is more work to be done and we\u2019re looking at ways to bring more political ads transparency to more regions and more types of elections.\"\n\nA Twitter spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to FOX Business\u2019 inquiry. The company has released information on government-sponsored misinformation campaigns.\n\nHowever, all three companies provide \u201cinadequate\u201d information about targeting information in the ads, even as the advertisers are able to \u201cmicro-target users,\u201d according to the report. Google \u201cis especially deficient,\u201d the group said, because it gives only broad ranges for the number of times an ad was shown.\n\n\u201cIt is still impossible to meaningfully understand who political advertisers are targeting across the three platforms,\u201d Privacy International said.\n\nThe group is recommending that the social media companies expand their transparency tools globally, provide upgraded ad libraries and share more information about how users are targeted by political advertisers.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Tech companies say they've made reforms.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/google-twitter-facebook.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
