Andrew spent multiple days on Epstein\u2019s private island in February 1999, and in 2000 the two saw each other nearly a half a dozen times or more in the United Kingdom and the United States, with Andrew reportedly staying at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan mansion multiple times, apparently followed by a New Year\u2019s excursion to Thailand in early 2001.\n\nWhile Andrew acknowledged he stayed in \u201ca number\u201d of Epstein\u2019s residences, he didn\u2019t mention he\u2019d invited Epstein to royal residences like Windsor Castle, Sandringham Estate, and Balmoral Castle.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jerry Dunleavy", "Washingtonexaminer.Com News Mystery-Over-When-Prince-Andrew-First-Met-Jeffery-Epstein-As-Flight-Logs-Detail-Close-Friendship"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
