They were handed their daughters Disney-emblazoned t-shirts which left them baffled\n\nThe pair seem delighted with their new clothes but are still confused as to why they have been presented with Disney-emblazoned clothes until they eventually twig\n\nThe girls excitedly ask 'what is it?' as they fumble around in the cloth bags.\n\nKenn asks 'you didn't notice what we were wearing?' as they each pull out a blue t-shirt.\n\nCecilia and Harper seem delighted with their new clothes but are still confused as to why they have been presented with Disney-emblazoned clothes.\n\nEventually, they twig as they being to squeal with glee.\n\nCecilia then bursts into tears as her younger sister repeatedly asks: 'When?'\n\nTheir parents reveal they are going right now which is met with even more tears and screams of joy.\n\nThe video ends shortly after.\n\nCecilia then bursts into tears as her younger sister repeatedly asks: 'When?'\n\nTheir parents said they were taken aback from the adorable reaction from the excited pair.\n\nAbby added: 'The girls had not noticed the whole morning that their Dad and I were wearing the same shirts.\n\n'I thought that using the 'Take me on a Cruise' shirts would be a great way to break the news to them without giving it away immediately that it was going to be a Disney cruise.\n\n'I had been planning the cruise for about six months without the girls knowing a single thing.\n\nTheir parents reveal they are going right now which is met with even more tears and screams of joy, which is where the video ends\n\n'Keeping it a secret from them was one of the hardest things I have had to do and I almost ruined the surprise a couple times.\n\n'The girls had been begging to go on a Disney cruise for years, but as with everyone, money was tight, so when we were able to do the cruise we wanted to make it extra special by not telling them about it until we pulled into the port that morning!'\n\n'When Cecilia reacted so emotionally it really took me aback and I couldn't help but cry right along with her.\n\n'This vacation was so needed for the four of us and a long time coming, lots of saving up.'", "description": "Abby and Kenn Snipes sprung the surprise en route to Port Canaveral, Florida.
