That (Brighton) game is in the past now.\u201d\n\nErasmus also acknowledged that their pre-tournament clash would have absolutely no bearing on how both sides played at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.\n\nJapan were error prone in the humid conditions and did not stretch the defence as much as they have other sides in the World Cup, while South Africa chose to play without the ball for long stretches to work on their defence and counter-attack.\n\n\u201cI must say that in that warm-up game, there was no pressure,\u201d Erasmus said.\n\n\u201cWe definitely won\u2019t be able to go with the same plan that we went into the warm-up game with (and) we will definitely have to come up with a totally new plan.\n\n\u201cIt will probably be something where we will have to match their pace and speed, and try to keep up with the way they play the game.\u201d\n\nThe former Springboks loose forward added that he had been impressed with the way Japan was developing and adapting for each game at the World Cup, while players like scrumhalf Yutaka Nagare were becoming the standouts of the tournament.\n\n\u201cTheir number nine (Nagare) is probably the guy who gets their game going,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cHe is probably the guy who cleans, at the World Cup, the fastest at the breakdown.\n\n\u201cThey are such a well-balanced team that it is difficult to single out one specific guy.\n\n\u201cYou can see they are aligned in their gameplan. So, as a unit, they are just really a formidable team.\u201d", "description": "Playing a warm-up fixture against Japan had been deliberate in order to try and dampen down any talk of the Brighton Miracle if the Springboks met the tournament hosts during the World Cup, South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus said on Monday.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440761270&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D19K-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
