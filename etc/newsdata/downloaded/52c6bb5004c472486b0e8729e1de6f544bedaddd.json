Divide was the biggest and most attended tour of all time.\n\nThere was nothing overly flash about it either - he just played loads of large venues to a huge number of people (an estimated 8.5 million).\n\nTicket sales are obviously going to make up a bulk of his wealth, but he gets pocket money from the songs he writes for others.\n\nWith credits on radio-friendly hits for (among others) Little Mix, Anne-Marie and Jess Glynne, it means he'll always have a steady stream of royalties to keep his bank account topped up.\n\nEd is an easy-going, likeable pop star but he's a shrewd businessman, with a hunger to keep going, breaking records and earning more.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "Ed Sheeran, Emma Watson and Cara Delevingne are among the 10 biggest-earning young UK celebrities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/093B/production/_109436320_edlive976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
