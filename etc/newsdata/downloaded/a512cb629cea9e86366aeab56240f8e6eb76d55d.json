Republicans, and not just Trump, seem visibly nervous. \u201cThis is shaping up to be a very dark moment for the Trump White House,\u201d a Republican source close to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told the National Journal Hotline\u2019s Josh Kraushaar. Even the Senate vote in an impeachment trial shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted, the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to be a harder choice for more people. Whether that\u2019s enough for enough senators to take decisive action . . . every single move has been in the wrong direction\u201d for Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s early days yet, of course, but since Taylor testified, political operatives have openly struggled to figure out whether this time might really be it. Everyone has his or her own little anecdotal data points, like the veteran Republican who told me he now thinks \u201cthere\u2019s about a twenty-five per cent\u201d chance \u201cthe dam breaks in the Senate and they turn on him and convict,\u201d or the fervent Never Trumper who, buoyed by the recent news, texted me that he was sure \u201cDT will be CONVICTED!\u201d Although, he added, in a nod to a more likely reality, \u201cunless, of course, that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Another Never Trumper, the former Republican senator Jeff Flake, said a couple of weeks ago that thirty-five Republican senators would probably vote to convict the President\u2014if the vote were held in secret. \u201cOnly 7 (!) Republican Senators are ruling out removing Donald Trump\u201d a headline on an article by the CNN political analyst Chris Cillizza read.
