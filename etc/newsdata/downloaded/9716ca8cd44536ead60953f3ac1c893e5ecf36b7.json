We chose them based on the breadth of their roles and responsibilities and their influence on company performance and the industry.\n\nThe list encompasses a variety of streaming companies, including advertisement-based-video-on-demand (AVOD) players like Tubi, ad-supported streaming-TV services like Pluto TV; niche services that have cornered a segment of the ad-supported-video market, like Revry; tech companies that are playing in the video space, like Twitter; and media companies that have been strategic in programming for these platforms, like Viacom Digital Studios.\n\nThe list does not include executives at ad-supported services like Hulu or ESPN Plus, which charge subscription fees. But it does include freemium offerings like Hotstar that offer a free ad-supported tier.\n\nThe power players are listed in alphabetical order.", "description": "We recognize 16 leaders who are helping to share the rise of free ad-supported streaming-TV services like Pluto TV and AVOD offerings like Tubi.", "authors": ["Ashley Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8a55a42e22af0bd26ed07d-1136-568.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
