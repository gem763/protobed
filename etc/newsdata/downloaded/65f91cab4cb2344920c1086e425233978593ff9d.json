Lionel Messi's best Ballon d'Or outfits 1/5 Ballon d'Or 2009-10 The dry years. There once was a time, a long time ago, when Lionel Messi wore conservative, moderate suits. Back in those dystopian times, the Argentinian superstar often elected to wear black as he conquered the footballing world, leaving the likes of previous winners Ronaldinho, Fabio Cannavaro and Kaka to a bygone era. Getty 2/5 Ballon d'Or 2011 The world was given one of its first glimpses into the wonderful and labyrinthine wardrobe of Messi a year later.
