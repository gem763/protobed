Some houses dazzled audiences with glitzy venues, performers\u2014and even a robot\u2014as if conceding that clothes alone aren\u2019t enough to inspire excitement. Here are five highlights of the week.\n\nThe Runway Show Is Back\n\nThe fashion show, which seemed in peril just a few seasons ago, is definitely in vogue. The number of shows on Fashion Week organizer IMG\u2019s calendar rose to 100 this season from 83 last season.\n\nJason Wu is among those who returned to the catwalk after taking two seasons off and hosting small presentations while his label reassessed business. Upscale contemporary fashion house rag & bone hosted runway shows following several seasons of presentations, short films and videos to preview collections. Just last year, founder and chief brand officer Marcus Wainwright told the WSJ the traditional runway show \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel original\u201d anymore. This time, Mr. Wainwright shook things up with a blend of technology and live performers. The rag & bone show had a circular runway, dancers, the Brooklyn Youth Chorus and drummers from the band Atoms of Peace. A robot captured video of the show and broadcast the footage on screens throughout the venue.\n\n\u201cTaking a break from presenting the collection in a traditional format has allowed us to explore different narratives that align with our brand aesthetic,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said. \u201cAnd to bring that all together under one roof, was in effect our answer to creating more of an experience, rather than a straight fashion show.\u201d\n\nRalph Lauren transformed a Wall Street site into \u2018Ralph\u2019s Club,\u2019 an over-the-top glamorous nightspot inspired by 1920s and \u201930s New York City.

That\u2019s what Ralph Lauren was after when he transformed a Wall Street building into an Art Deco nightclub inspired by 1920s and 1930s New York City. The evening set a new bar for over-the-top glamour and excitement. As guests in black tie or black-and-white arrived at \u201cRalph\u2019s Club,\u201d a band played American Songbook favorites. Models sauntered among the tables and booths, showing off the clothes. After the show, Janelle Monae brought the house down by singing jazz tunes, dancing on tables and engaging the audience in call-and-response.\n\n\u201cRalph\u2019s Club was about getting dressed up and wearing something that you love that makes you feel good and then going to a place that lifts you up for that moment,\u201d said Mr. Lauren, who has made his runway shows immersive experiences in recent years.\n\nTommy Hilfiger also embraced escapism, showing his latest collection co-designed with performer Zendaya at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. The outdoor set recreated a \u201970s-era block party with models dancing to recorded music amid brownstone stoops and shiny convertibles. Tom Ford celebrated iconic New York by showing in an abandoned subway station. The designer cited a 1965 photo of Andy Warhol and muse Edie Sedgwick atop a New York City manhole as an inspiration.\n\nThe Deveaux New York show had a drumline and singers, seen on the runway with designer Tommy Ton, in white shirt.

They need Instagrammable entertainment\u2014so having a dance or song performance has almost become a must. Designers hope such bells and whistles enhance the clothes, not distract from them. Deveaux New York, a New York-based luxury minimalist line that specializes in elevating wardrobe classics, hosted a celebratory show with a drumline, a small band and lead singers who have appeared on \u201cThe Voice.\u201d Models, including amateurs as well as notables like Veronica Webb and DJ Honey Dijon, danced on the runway. The Blonds, a luxury house whose over-the-top getups are favored by entertainers, collaborated with \u201cMoulin Rouge! The Musical\u201d for its fashion show at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre. Cast members performed songs while celebrities including Billy Porter and Paris Hilton made appearances. Ulla Johson\u2019s show included a small indie band. Meanwhile, Christian Siriano of \u201cProject Runway\u201d fame set up gallerist and painter Ashley Longshore on stage. As models including Siriano favorite Coco Rocha strode around her, Ms. Longshore worked on huge portraits of Frida Kahlo, Laverne Cox, Ms. Rocha and others.\n\nGuests arrived at the Pyer Moss show Sunday at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn.

Mr. Raymond, who grew up in Brooklyn, wanted his young fans to be part of the spectacle at the Kings Theatre in the borough\u2019s Flatbush neighborhood. The 32-year-old designer used social media to make that happen, first through open casting calls on Instagram and then by inviting 500 fans, also on Instagram. The other 2,500 guests were a mix of friends, celebrities and industry professionals. Thousands of people sought tickets; Mr. Jean-Raymond reposted a fan\u2019s message joking that she was willing \u201cto sell her soul\u201d to get in.\n\nBrandon Maxwell, on the runway at his show Saturday, was among designers who held shows in Brooklyn. Photo: Bebeto Matthews/Associated Press\n\nBrooklyn Is the Place to Be\n\nIn recent years, just two or three high-profile brands took the edgy step of making the fashion flock trek from Manhattan to the hip borough of Brooklyn. This season, an increasing number of designers\u2014even die-hard Manhattan fan Michael Kors\u2014held shows there. Brandon Maxwell, who won the top womenswear designer award this year from the Council of Fashion Designers, turned a Brooklyn event space into a bar called Brandon\u2019s. A neon pink sign spelled out the name of the bar, which offered cotton candy and sippy cups of cocktails such as a \u201cNew Fashioned.\u201d Tory Burch showed at the Brooklyn Museum, where the CFDA has twice held its annual awards. Also showing in Brooklyn were Phillip Lim, Rihanna (for the second time) and Eckhaus Latta, a fashion-show-in-Brooklyn pioneer. Why? Because Brooklyn is cool. Mr. Maxwell lives there, as do a number of young designers, and, he told Women\u2019s Wear Daily, he wanted to celebrate the place.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What did you think were the highlights of New York Fashion Week?
