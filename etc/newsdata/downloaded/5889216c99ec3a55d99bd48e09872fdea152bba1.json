(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nPresident Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) could hardly be more at odds \u2014 but behind the scenes, they\u2019re still grasping at a bipartisan deal to lower the high cost of prescription drugs.\n\nPelosi\u2019s office and the White House confirmed that the speaker's top health aide, Wendell Primus, spoke on the phone last week with Joe Grogan, director of the Trump's Domestic Policy Council. The conversation follows a meeting earlier this month between top administration health officials and Primus, who has been acting as the main go-between as the White House seeks broad action on drug prices.\n\n\u201cThe lines of communication have been open on this topic with the speaker\u2019s office,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere told The Health 202.\n\nPelosi spokesman Henry Connelly stressed the conversations aren\u2019t \u201cnegotiations\u201d but instead center on the speaker\u2019s own drug pricing legislation, which would allow the federal government to directly negotiate lower prices with private companies in Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program.\n\nBut for Pelosi to get that bill passed into law \u2014 or at least elements of it \u2014 she would need approval from Trump, who has in the past supported the idea of allowing direct negotiations even though it\u2019s anathema to congressional Republicans.\n\nWere the pair to arrive at any agreement on drug prices, it would be in the face of enormous odds. In their public interactions, Pelosi and Trump have reached new levels of animosity in recent weeks, as she pursues an impeachment inquiry while he tweets angry insults at her.\n\nDemocrats' case for impeachment was strengthened yesterday, with testimony from the senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, the Post's Dan Balz writes. William Taylor's recounting of events \"directly contradicts the president asserts that military assistance was withheld for months as Trump was demanding an explicit statement from Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky confirming that he would launch investigations the president wanted,\" Dan writes.\n\nMeanwhile, this is how Trump has been tweeting about Pelosi over the past few weeks:\n\nNancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her \u201cupstairs,\u201d or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2019\n\nNancy Pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices & working on the desperately needed USMCA. She is incapable of working on either. It is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment. The Do Nothing Democrats are stuck in mud! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nYet Pelosi has dismissed the idea that Trump\u2019s comments would cause her to stop working with him on the issue of high drug costs. She told reporters last week the president\u2019s comments are \u201cnot important, in that regard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will do what we need to do for the good of the American people, and that has nothing to do with him,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThere may be some collateral benefit to him, when we successfully achieve something for the American people, but there is no reason not to do it because there is a collateral benefit to him.\u201d\n\nIf the two were to strike a deal, it would probably be within the next few weeks, before Congress leaves town for the Thanksgiving holiday. Meanwhile, Pelosi is moving quickly to get her own legislation through the House \u2014 although she\u2019s running up against some resistance from liberals in her caucus.\n\nIn a private caucus meeting yesterday, multiple top Democrats complained the Pelosi legislation \u2014 now named the \u201cElijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act,\u201d after the longtime congressman who died last week \u2014 doesn\u2019t go far enough in allowing direct negotiations for Medicare, Politico reports.\n\nThe bill requires that the government negotiate lower prices for at least 35 drugs per year but no more than 250 drugs. While the pharmaceutical industry has complained that would eventually allow negotiations for virtually every drug covered by Medicare, House progressives have raised the opposite concern \u2014 that most drug prices would never be covered by the legislation.\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) is among the loudest skeptics of the Pelosi measure as it currently stands, expressing frustration it doesn\u2019t go far enough. The progressive group Public Citizen has also been demanding changes, including one that would completely remove a provision in the law explicitly banning the health and human services secretary from direct negotiations over drugs provided in Medicare.\n\nReps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Katie Porter (D-Calif.) argued during the caucus meeting that Democrats shouldn\u2019t limit the number of drugs that could be negotiated, members present told Politico's Sarah Ferris and Heather Caygle. DeLauro acknowledged to them that \u201cthere are questions about the numbers of drugs covered.\u201d\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) speaks on Capitol Hill. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nYesterday the House Ways and Means Committee became the third committee to pass the Pelosi bill, after a markup that began in the morning and stretched into the evening. As in prior hearings, Republicans voiced deep disapproval of the bill, saying it amounts to government price-fixing and charging it would quash drug innovation.\n\n\u201cThis is the end of Medicare as we know it,\u201d said Rep. Kevin Brady (Tex.), the committee's ranking Republican.\n\nFierceHealthcare's Robert King:\n\nNearly three hours later, House Ways & Means finally brings up Pelosi drug plan in mark up.

If Trump and Pelosi broker a deal, it will be because they both think it will provide an advantage to them among voters heading into the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cThe polling has been clear that voters want to see progress on drug pricing and will vote accordingly,\u201d said Rodney Whitlock, a former health policy aide to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). \u201cIt shouldn't be that surprising that staff are working to see what is possible. Given the policy overlap, compromise is clearly plausible.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy.

(Matt York/AP)\n\nAHH: A new analysis suggests an Alzheimer\u2019s drug deemed a failure earlier this year was actually effective.\n\nIn March, clinical trials were suspended because an independent monitoring board said that treatment did not offer much hope of success. Now the board has reversed its position on aducanumab after new data from the discontinued studies showed that at high doses the drug reduced cognitive decline in patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s, our Post colleague Tara Bahrampour reports.\n\nDrug manufacturer Biogen now says patients who received the antibody saw \u201csignificant benefits on measures of cognition and function such as memory, orientation and language.\u201d The company is planning to move forward to seek regulatory approval for the therapy in the United States as it also pursues discussions with international regulatory agencies.\n\n\u201cThe FDA said on Monday that Biogen could file for approval for the drug; the company expects to do so in early 2020. Biogen said it aims to offer it to patients who were previously enrolled in those studies,\u201d Tara reports. \u201cIf approved, aducanumab would become the first therapy to reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\"\n\nStudents prepare to testify before the Oregon legislature in February in support of mental health days. (Kristen Downey)\n\nOOF: Numerous states and school systems are now letting students take mental health days.\n\nOver the summer, Oregon enacted such a law that enables students to take days off school for mental health reasons. Before the new law, students there had five days of excused absences for physical illnesses, doctor appointments or family emergencies. In Utah, the state changed its definition of a legitimate excused absence to include mental health issues. There are similar laws in the works in Colorado, Florida and Washington.\n\nThese changes are emerging as youth are seeing increased rates of depression, anxiety and suicide, our Post colleague William Wan reports.\n\nHailey Hardcastle, a 19-year-old who helped advocate for the Oregon law told William: \u201cHigh school can be a lonely, difficult place to begin with. But there\u2019s so much more pressure these days \u2014 getting into college, the social pressure, even just the state of the world and what you\u2019re exposed to with climate change, and everything going on with politics.

Of the residents who could be impacted, 9,197 are \u201cmedical-baseline\u201d customers who need electricity for various health reasons, our Post colleague Matthew Cappucci reports.\n\n\u201cEach customer has been notified of the possible shut-off; electric-dependent customers with medical issues who have not responded to PG&E\u2019s notification will be visited by a company employee,\u201d he writes.\n\nThe company told residents there will be community resource centers available starting today that will have restrooms, bottled water, electronic-device charging and air-conditioned seating for anyone affected by the outages.\n\nIf you rely on electric or battery-dependent medical technologies such as assistive technology, breathing machines, a power wheelchair or scooter & home oxygen or dialysis, it is critical that you have a plan in place for an extended power outage https://t.co/X1ClEBVeda pic.twitter.com/7ATiNyCh4Q \u2014 PG&E (@PGE4Me) October 22, 2019\n\nHEALTH ON THE HILL\n\n\u2014 The Republican Study Committee, a group of House conservatives, says it has delivered on Trump's promise earlier this year that Republicans would be \u201cthe party of health care.\u201d The group released a plan yesterday to repeal or reshape much of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, using its subsidies for private plans to instead fund insurance pools for high-risk patients and turning the money for Medicaid expansion into a block grant to states.\n\nThe plan would retain some of the ACA's protections for patients with preexisting conditions but undo its ban on annual and lifetime limits on covered benefits and its requirement that insurers cover preventive services for free. It would also let states decide which \u201cessential health benefits\u201d insurers must cover for enrollees. More than half of the 66-page document is spent criticizing the ACA and single-payer proposals.\n\n\u201cI had occasion to talk to the president again this morning and reminded him today is the big day for the rollout,\u201d said RSC Chairman Mike Johnson (R-La.). \u201cHe was very encouraged by that and told me we should 'Go get 'em.' We are fulfilling the promise he's made and we all made when we ran for office.\u201d\n\nUndated photo of Erin and Beto O'Rourke. (Courtesy of Beto O'Rourke)\n\n\u2014 Democratic presidential contender and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke rolled out part of a disability proposal last week to expand health-care coverage for medical equipment. It\u2019s a plan that was in part inspired by his sister, Erin, who was born with intellectual disabilities.\n\nO'Rourke spoke with our Post colleague Jackie Alemany in the first interview in which he\u2019s talked in detail about Erin, saying his diability plan will be rolled out soon.\n\n\u201cIt focuses on addressing what O\u2019Rourke calls an \u2018institutional bias that exists in federal funding and priorities right now\u2019 against those with disabilities,\u201d Jackie reports. \u201cO\u2019Rourke wants to ensure disabled individuals receive long-term home and community-based services and that the federal government provides states with additional funding for the disabled community. The proposal will also bolster existing protections supporting disabled individuals.\u201d That includes a Supreme Court ruling that allows disabled individuals the right to live in a community with public support, rather than in an institution, and that requires that they can receive care in their own homes.\n\nAfter Erin graduated from high school in Texas, she lived with O\u2019Rourke. That\u2019s when his family discovered there was a 18 to 20-year wait list to receive state-supported disability services. It\u2019s also when he realized it was critical to provide his sister with some sort of independence.\n\n\u201cMaking sure she received the help and care she needed really made an impact on me \u2014 as does meeting so many of these families with physical and intellectual disabilities who are working so hard to make sure their family members should live life to their full potential,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told Jackie.\n\nREPRODUCTIVE WARS\n\nThe exterior of the new Planned Parenthood facility in Fairview Heights, Ill. (Christian Gooden/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/AP)\n\n\u2014 This week, a new massive Planned Parenthood clinic is opening in Illinois. It's set to be one of the largest abortion clinics in the Midwest region.\n\nThe clinic aims to serve about 11,000 women a year and is double the capacity of the clinic it\u2019s replacing. It\u2019s 15 miles from downtown St. Louis in Missouri, a state with strict abortion restrictions that has only one remaining abortion clinic.\n\n\u201cIts size says as much about the future as the present: With the Supreme Court\u2019s shift to the right, activists on both sides of the abortion divide are adjusting their strategy, anticipating that Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that extended federal protections to abortion, might eventually be overturned and that some states would jump at the chance to ban abortions,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Sabrina Tavernise reports. \u201cFor abortion rights advocates, one response is already taking shape: centers like this one that could provide services to women throughout their region \u2014 who could come from states where abortion is legal and states where it is not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a post-Roe world, this is crucial to our mission,\" said Yamelsie Rodriguez, president of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, about establishing access for the region.\n\nMallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for antiabortion group Susan B. Anthony List told Sabrina the new clinic signals the need for federal legislation limiting abortion. \u201cIt\u2019s sickening to see Planned Parenthood set up these mega-centers,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that places like Illinois, California and New York are unlikely to change in the near future.\u201d\n\n\u2014 And here are a few more good reads:\n\nNational An overlooked consequence of the Supreme Court\u2019s gerrymandering rulings: Stricter abortion laws In Michigan, a Supreme Court ruling and an obscure law could help antiabortion groups pass more restrictions without the Democratic governor or a popular vote.
